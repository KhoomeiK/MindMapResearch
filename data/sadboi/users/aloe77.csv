stopdrinking,fdiq5b5,t1_fdior1q,1578448542.0,Thanks so much. I have an appt day after tomorrow at a good clinic.
stopdrinking,fcswqa6,t1_fcsmtpq,1577927047.0,There was no one in there surprisingly enough. The other health care professionals I've been making calls to today seemed perplexed as well. Hope I don't lose my courage while I wait.
depression,fcmzua2,t1_fcmqt3m,1577799041.0,I can't claim to be schooled in this venture but I've had nothing but positive support here. And to me that is surprising on an online public platform.
depression,fcm8wso,t1_fcm7z8s,1577767392.0,Same to you!
depression,fcm72w1,t1_fcm6wsj,1577765935.0,Those all make sense.
depression,fcm5x1w,t1_fcgojkw,1577765061.0,Hope we figure it out. I think any contact is better than none. Still don't really get why it can be so hard to make a phone call. May be part of isolating or maybe protecting ourselves from stressors. Or is that the same thing? Not to group you in with my shit but just thoughts.
stopdrinking,fcm4v81,t1_fcjszhu,1577764294.0,Thanks for responding. I appreciate it.
stopdrinking,fcjbips,t1_fch4vea,1577682180.0,I just meant to a different facility.
depression,fcj69f8,t1_fcgzkvz,1577678306.0,"Yeah that's always good. Sometimes doesn't seem enough or that those phone calls can be challenging. 
Yeah maybe that was too ""blanket""? I suppose I should have added ""to me"" but I'm assuming I'm not alone in feeling misunderstood at times as uncaring or unconcerned about other people. I care a lot. Some days I can't function to express that. Some days I just can't feel anything at all."
depression,fcg5usb,t3_eh41bc,1577636769.0, Sometimes dropping off can signal that you are just busy not necessarily that something is wrong. If you are comfortable enough to voice how you feel I'd hope someone would take over the initiating. It's a risk I know. I'd tell them. Or at least one friend. Who knows. They might feel the same.
Anxiety,fcfixew,t3_egwsh0,1577630491.0,That used to stress me out so much in a job setting. It is certainly not uncommon I've now learned. I once had a superior ask me to spell my name and I froze in the middle! Hoping that makes you feel a little better...
stopdrinking,fcfhypw,t1_fccge3e,1577630151.0,Thank you. I'm afraid of the anxiety.

stopdrinking,fcbmbny,t1_fcb5t9s,1577588508.0,I guess bad enough to need meds for withdrawal? I'm up to speed on the dangers and will be safe. I've heard that with the hospital rt they sometimes hold you for quite a while and ship you off somewhere. I know of a clinic that's not as easily accessible but sounds like the better option. I'm just questioning what will be suitable for what's right. I'm sure you know any obstacle is an opportunity to change your mind
stopdrinking,fcbjz6y,t1_fcb5dhg,1577587752.0,Thank you. I really appreciate it.
Anxiety,f4wpd50,t1_f4wggj2,1571858528.0,That's great news! PC said they would want to biopsy so assumed that's what would happen. Oral surgeon said it was benign just from looking and palpating. It's a bit bulbous so he said it wasn't necessary but if I wanted he could remove it. No thanks!
Anxiety,f4pfdr6,t1_f3whup8,1571727749.0,Any news? Lot of worry for nothing on this end. They didn't even want to take it out.

Anxiety,f3ig8wh,t1_f3dx2uo,1570936208.0,How's the recovery?
depression,f2fo9dk,t3_ddacph,1570220524.0,"Same. I have friends that I feel ok opening up to and being vulnerable around. Humor, I think, is a great coping mechanism but I think it's important to have an outlet for your real and serious self. Use your humor as a tool and not a curtain."
Anxiety,f239uz6,t1_f20w2hi,1569912539.0,I couldn't agree more. Wow thank you I wasn't expecting support in response. ‚ù§
stopdrinking,f20lpu8,t3_dbcy2g,1569861140.0,Eee I hope she's not practicing. Family dynamics can be strange and complicated. Sorry that you're dealing with this. Perhaps she has a problem with alcohol as well? Kinda sounds like it. Ugh it's so hard to abstain even when it's just around nevermind someone actually ridiculing you for it. If you voice this and it continues I don't think it would be a bad idea to put some distance between you. It's tough but not wrong to do what's best for your health.
Anxiety,f20k6o9,t3_dbddyc,1569860628.0,Uggghhhh alcohol is so bad for anxiety. If you feel like you can cut it out please do. It sounds like you have great coping skills for your anxiety. That's awesome. Wish I could summarize here what happens in your brain but you can look it up. It's there. I am on the bad end of the self medicating stick. Don't be like me. Keep doing what you're doing and curb the drinking if you can.
depression,f0uw3h5,t3_d6m9zy,1568952781.0,I'd never say it will get better but I would say it can. It really sucks to learn to be your own advocate when it comes to health care. Mental or otherwise. Got some horror stories over here ha. But. There do exist good health care professionals that are in their profession because they want to help people. It's worth it to find them.
depression,f0uv3io,t3_d6mlx2,1568951772.0,May I ask your age? I'm going to assume you have a lot of life left in you. Physically. Could be wrong. I'm so sorry that you are in this pain. Message if you'd like to talk vent whatever.
stopdrinking,f0s5hk7,t3_d6bfrg,1568899193.0,I mostly lurk only because it's not often I can post without breaking the rules. I try to respect that. It's a good rule. Thanks for sharing. It's always nice to see something positive on here.
stopdrinking,f0s3pqd,t3_d6886i,1568898307.0,I wish we'd never done this to ourselves. But that's looking back. Thanks for sharing these words. Motivation to look forward. The reality that  it will be a challenge but the inspiration that it will be worth it. Most things worth anything take hard work.
Anxiety,f0psg35,t1_f0k5vat,1568846258.0,Hmm I wonder why. Good to know. Seems like you shouldn't have to look at comments on your own posts that are unsettling. Well I guess you can't escape these things on the internet but I think it's great that you're tying to reach out period. Good luck. I hope you have a better experience going forward.
Anxiety,f0e1118,t1_f0dxm1z,1568561607.0,You are not crazy. CBT was helpful for me. It helps connect the dots. I think I might know what you mean? No obvious triggers for a looooong time. It was really confusing and I definitely thought I was losing my mind on more than a few occasions. It was a tremendous relief to finally find people who knew what could be going on.
Anxiety,f0dwedw,t3_d4kvvq,1568559472.0,Sounds right. I have to say keep looking for psych docs. Someone will have insight and hopefully at the very least give you some peace of mind. I dealt with the same thing for many years. Physical symptoms preceding the mental anxiety. It manifests itself in so many ways. But yes ruling out anything else is usually a good idea. Especially if you don't have any other symptoms of an anxiety disorder.
Anxiety,f0dtuym,t3_d4gzuo,1568558551.0,I'm sorry that happened. Those people don't know you and are inconsiderate. I don't know you either but know enough that this is a place where people go for support and are vulnerable. People project. People take advantage of their anonymity. And some are just unkind. That's so weird that you were banned? That makes no sense and is upsetting. I haven't seen anything really negative on this group. Hope you have a better experience here. Feel free to message if you want to vent.
stopdrinking,f0dohpq,t1_f0dna2g,1568556714.0,Thank you.
stopdrinking,f0dldnu,t1_f0a9f0n,1568555607.0,That it probably won't work for me ha. But man that part of my brain keeps trying.
depression,f06a369,t3_d3xhot,1568433174.0,Yes. It's hard to not perceive this as some absimal regression. But every time you go through something difficult you are learning. It does not often feel that way at the time.
stopdrinking,f00ufhf,t3_d34qkx,1568306597.0,Is it correct to assume that there is more of a sense of accountability with something like AA?
stopdrinking,f00u61v,t1_ezzduhj,1568306496.0,Thank you. Usually the thing you want to do least is what will be most beneficial. So I'm hoping working with someone will help me get over my anxiety of group settings.
depression,ezyzse3,t3_d340h3,1568277809.0,Same. It seems like the only thing that makes me happy. I've been considering volunteering at a shelter or farm for a while. A thought.
Anxiety,ezyyt8m,t3_d30edg,1568277281.0,May I ask if there's anything in particular that makes you feel that way? I think if you're getting positive feedback from the people in your life you can probably trust that. If by toxic you mean just needing a little extra support sometimes I think that's okay. That's what friends are for. I'm sure you've been there for them too right?
depression,ezyxsr0,t3_d3149t,1568276717.0,Sorry question was do you consider them close friends? What is their value to you?
depression,ezyxnem,t3_d3149t,1568276637.0,Are these people you consider
depression,ez62wx8,t3_d00t3s,1567708555.0,"35 and still figuring it all out. Some people never do. You've got a leg up just being able to acknowledge the issue. As for moms, her intentions may be good but maybe she just doesn't understand. If possible communicate. If not maybe take some distance."
depression,ez5z6kg,t1_eyzijo2,1567707123.0,"I appreciate your opening up. It's hard for me to admit. 
I don't think that's weird. We all have are own method of self soothing. Luckily that's not a harmful one. I worked hard on being okay with being alone but I've now taken it too far and have been isolating myself for too long. It's not healthy. I'm a big believer in that there are plenty of people out there ready to accept you the way you are if you're willing to be receptive. How to go about that I haven't quite nailed down..."
depression,eywesl2,t3_cz4ckx,1567527815.0,I'm not sure. Trying to figure that out myself. Everyone needs touch. And intamicy in some form. The other night I had an uncontrollable sobbing fit because I wanted so much for someone to hold my hand. Came out of nowhere. I just knew it was something I didn't have. You're not alone on that.
depression,eyls6cf,t1_eylqk7l,1567190721.0,Thanks. I hope so.
depression,exsoq8a,t3_cu97vr,1566551886.0,Also on 20mg escitalopram and klonopin as needed. I would make that appointment sooner than later if you are experiencing mania. I did notice some increased risk taking behavior when I started. For me it wasn't too bad. I don't think I was in danger so the benefit outweighed the risk.    Or maybe I just got off easy during that transition period. Pros and cons of meds can make for difficult decisions. Just make sure you have a Dr who hears your concerns.
Anxiety,exi9o9w,t3_cszfwg,1566323863.0,Positive messages are important in this group. While I truly do appreciate everything anybody has the guts to share it can be overwhelming and depressing sometimes. I guess I mean to say it's nice to hear an upside as much as it is comforting to know you're not alone in your struggles.
depression,excrast,t3_cs27u9,1566157650.0,Oh man it took me so long to get out of that mindset. It still interferes with the way I communicate my feelings at times. So many people close to me have been through horrific trauma. It's all relative. Everyone processes their own experience in different ways. And some are more predisposed than others to anxiety/depression for a variety of reasons. It's tough to stop comparing. It is not helpful. While it's good to be mindful of others' experiences it's more important to realize what kind of care you need.
depression,ewecjia,t3_cnpmd1,1565320128.0,I'm sorry. Sometimes every breath feels like a burden. If there is anything a stranger like me can do for you remotely I'm listening.
Anxiety,ewcotyn,t3_cnh2zi,1565288127.0,Same. I have trouble finding the right words to describe my thoughts and then the fear of being misinterpreted. I wonder if here that might be heightened just by sensitivity to others that you relate to. As in I'm sure a lot of us easily misinterpret sentiments meant to be supportive in some negative way. A sort of pressure to be as clear as possible?
depression,evw7npb,t3_clhszv,1564857185.0,You should credit yourself for coming to that realization. It's a tough concept that we can't always fix everything all by ourselves. Maybe that next step could be letting someone help you.
stopdrinking,evq9lj9,t1_evq7r2f,1564689144.0,Woops read too fast haha. I hope you get yourself checked out. In my experience the anxiety of not knowing just makes me drink more. Plus sometimes physicians have a lot of resources that you may not know about. Honestly I needed some mental health care before I was ready to go for a physical for the first time in several years.
stopdrinking,evq7eo1,t1_evpo65v,1564687886.0,I'm sorry I just meant it's never too late to try in response to your fear of finding out what's going on in your body. Though it's understandable given the trauma you went through. I also apologize for not expressing condolences. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. And yes you are absolutely right sometimes for some they try too late and I'm so sorry you were touched so closely by that. But it doesn't mean that you will have the same fate. Every body is different. I truly appreciate you sharing your story and sending the message. Reading posts like yours helped me get into a doctor's office. I'm sure others have benefited as well. I hope you've gone in to see someone since.
depression,euz3liu,t3_chx5vf,1564112739.0,You are certainly not alone in that! It wasn't a goal of mine at the time but I realized how important it was to become emotionally independent. That came with being active in addressing my mental health. Leaving a long term relationship that was contributing to my anxiety/depression. Going to therapy. Finding medication that worked for me (after a several years' long phobia of meds!). Got to a point where I actually enjoyed alone time. Still working on a balance but I truly believe that those were necessary steps.
depression,eu3sklq,t3_cef9y3,1563424000.0,You deserve the same that you give to others. If peacemaking/caretaking is what you thrive on it can be really difficult to find a balance. Or to identify your limits and boundaries with certain people. Or even to identify with yourself. It's sometimes easier to pour all of your energy into other people's needs instead of knowing yourself. Even though that's not easy at all.
depression,eu3r7c3,t3_ceauzq,1563422756.0,Just post it. The worst that could happen is no one responds BUT I guarantee you people read it and some want to respond but do the same thing and delete. At least you're getting it out. I'm thinking of deleting this right now because it's probably not helpful. But I'm gonna do it anyway.
depression,etv00q3,t1_etux5ll,1563223440.0,Thank you. That's very interesting. If you're still listening what kind of daily supplement do you take?
depression,etu3p1o,t1_ettf77v,1563203473.0,I had no idea a deficiency could reduce the effect of other meds. Thanks for the response. May I ask what meds?
depression,ettfour,t3_cd9p5b,1563177430.0,It's a really uncomfortable and unnatural feeling to see a therapist. I don't know that I'll ever get used to it no matter how many I've seen. I have definitely felt that way before. Like they are taking my money and I'm not getting anything out of it and they don't care. I believe there are some not so great doctors out there but I also believe that there have been certain times in my life where I just wasn't fully open to the help that was being offered. Partly and directly from bad experiences from mental health professionals I had seen before. Doctor shop. Find someone you like. Or are at least don't hate haha. Know that they are working for you and you can express what you like and dislike in a therapist. Easier said than done. I'm not good at it. I just hope you keep looking.
depression,et55qrx,t3_c9z6zv,1562464751.0,You are beautiful. Because you are a living human form. If someone were to say that to me I would tell them to fuck off. But I really believe it to be true. You just can't see it.
Anxiety,erghbd8,t3_c1woda,1560839382.0,"Maybe you were attracted to each other for similar reasons. You liked that he was ""uptight"" and possibly he liked that you were not. Like looking for a complimentary person. Check in with yourself about what's okay with you. I hope you don't feel pressured into conceding to or participating in anything you don't want to."
Anxiety,erggx4c,t3_c1q68h,1560838871.0,It seems to happen so fast and the recovery is so slow. When you have anxiety and always on guard the moment something bad happens it fortifies and perpetuates those fears. I found CBT to be helpful.
depression,eqlc3hv,t3_byso4k,1560141465.0,That's solid advice about the pill cutting if you need to. Of course you should do whatever you can to avoid the lapse. About medication. Benefit vs risk. It's really hard to accept that you may need it for the rest of your life. But they're are plenty of people who have come off antidepressants successfully and thrived. And some not. I think whatever is helping you function now is probably good. I'm on lexapro too and had an insurance lapse and withdrew. It wasn't great! But yeah I understand that feeling of not wanting to be dependent. And if you ever did want to get off them a slow taper would not make you feel so bad.
depression,eqlaty4,t3_byrg8k,1560140676.0,Hopefully if you have a good doctor they'll pick that up and send you home with some resources and contacts. You may just want to directly ask for that info. Good for you. And good luck tomorrow. It's so hard to get the motivation to ask for what you need. Or even realize what you need!
depression,eql9tib,t3_bym7ki,1560140047.0,Yikes. I suppose it depends on the content of what happened. That's awful I'm sorry. It's so hard to get yourself there and then to have it be a horrible experience can just be retraumatizing. It can turn you away from the entire profession.  I hope you can rebound and try talking to someone else. I've found that the psych docs in hospitals are less sensitive and less qualified than other resources. I hope you carry on the effort.
depression,eql8gzp,t3_byrn9t,1560139240.0,I like it. With suicidal intrusive thoughts you just gotta try everything. Break the loop. Thank you.
Anxiety,eql7ek6,t3_bym6wm,1560138617.0,Good job! That's a hard thing to do. Hope the next one's a better fit!
depression,eq994fr,t3_bxoxvx,1559894142.0,It's understandable. To me at least and I'm sure countless others. Because it takes so much effort it does feel like you've tried it all and that it is hopeless. There is always something else. There are always more experiences to have that even if you just can't make yourself want to have are worth having. It's just so hard sometimes to do. Anything.
depression,eptu8od,t3_bvwobb,1559497695.0,You are helping people right now by being honest. Helping them to not feel alone in these thoughts. No one can tell you what to do. But you're life is worth something. Even to all of these people who have never even met you.
stopdrinking,epec0b6,t1_epdkzx4,1559180920.0,For sure. Sticking with Indica and cbd for anxiety for starters. Thank you for your response.
stopdrinking,epeawpi,t1_epdk9za,1559180546.0,Weed is definitely not my drug of choice. I hate feeling high. But on the rare occasion that I use it I notice it has helped with appetite and mood a bit. I'm looking into low or no thc products.
stopdrinking,epeagks,t1_epdjgx5,1559180398.0,Thank you.
stopdrinking,epdj81f,t1_epdhrzu,1559167312.0,Details?
Anxiety,eowekfd,t3_bt9kmp,1558908779.0,I think that's pretty normal. Sometimes you feel those segrations of logic and emotion. Sometimes one is louder than the other. It's an odd thing to feel. When it interferes with your life sometimes you need to address it. But the fact that you are conscious of it is a leg up.
stopdrinking,eowd656,t3_btc2tp,1558908257.0,Good point. Am planning to attend a meeting. Thank you.
stopdrinking,eowd213,t1_eovqytb,1558908209.0,Yes. I am extremely grateful that most of the people in my life are supportive. Drinking or sober. Same here. Planning on going. Just need to do it!
stopdrinking,eowcta3,t1_eovqpsr,1558908110.0,I'm in the midst of getting professional help but always stop short of quitting. Over the last couple of years I have isolated myself and pretty much have one local friend I talk to and one long distance one who is sober and extremely supportive. I think I'm just craving socialization. I guess you could call that lonely? But want to create healthy relationships.
stopdrinking,eowbsxn,t1_eovrpav,1558907729.0,It's been recommended to me a lot but I have reservations about going to my first meeting alone. Any tips for someone with social anxiety?
stopdrinking,eowbf9c,t1_eovsace,1558907580.0,Nope. It's not working at all. I don't know what it's going to take for me and that's scary. It's been about 20 years in the making so I can't expect it to be easy. I guess I just want all of the outside insight that I can get. Thank you for responding.
Anxiety,eohjuc9,t3_bro7we,1558583494.0,I get it. There are some days where you don't want to hear those inspirational quotes. That's okay. But sometimes for some people they are helpful. That's good enough reason to share. Anything positive is cool in my book even if not applicable to me at a particular time. I don't care for term comfortable or comfort zone because it's really not comfortable at all. I think familiar would be a better word. Everyone is on some level afraid of the unknown. More often than not trying something new that you have reservations about reveals a positive outcome.
