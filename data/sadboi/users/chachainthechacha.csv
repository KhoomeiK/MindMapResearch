2. Trigger warning but in my experience this is the cold hard truth, so pardon me of I come off as rude.

 Fat is easy to lose, muscle is hard to gain. People who ""just can't lose weight"" either have no idea wtf to do, but more likely is that are just lazy and unwilling to actually put in effort. Theres a reason you only need 12-16 weeks to be contest lean for a bodybuilding, but need a lifetime of training to win. Yes it sucks to eat less but it's simple. Less calories in=weight lost. Muscle does not come easy however,  as the process to build is slow and complex. so sacrificing time that can be used to make gains to make a skinny body even skinnier is not doing anyone favours. Additionally, if you do it right with your frame you won't look any fatter, but on fact leaner as the muscle will protrude."

I don't really do any direct delt work as the rowing and pressing does plenty. For reference, my lifts are B215/S275/D320/OHP130 at 155BW and ~2 ish years of experience, although I only started direct strength work in September (hypertrophy PPL before that).

Apart from chinups (which I would definitely recommend doing, and focusing on progressively overloading ), it's difficult to focus on ""compound"" movements for biceps seeing as there aren't that many. What I'd recommend next is seeing if your long head is lagging, as chins, and basic curl variations hit the short head more due to the shoulder being flexed. Do exercises like Incline curls and drag curls (getting the shoulder into extension). I'd also try emphasizing the brachialis (which makes your biceps appear wider and thicker) by hammer curls and cross body hammer curls.

Yet if I did 20 sets of curls once a week, I'd still be very sorry but growth likely wouldn't be optimal. What muscle growth really comes down to is volume. If say, in theory, you were able to squat 15 sets once per week at 10 reps for your 10rm, growth would probably be similar to dividing it up over 5 sets 3x week. But your body fatigues within a workout, and by set 15 you will not be lifting the same amount of weight as you did on set 1. Contrarily, on set 5, it is likely you still won't be able to get your 10rm, but there will still be a lot more left in the tank.

The report also demonstrates that rather than the Quebecois revolting against the system as a whole in which the British were on top, lower Canada was dissatisfied with acute conditions such as the crop yield, political instability as a result of upper Canada and lower Canada having extremely different demographics, and a lack of responsible government.

AskHistorians,fc7mj06,t1_fc7bdug,1577512345.0,"Modern Quebec nationalism began with the death of Maurice Duplessis, the premier of Quebec until 1960. Under Duplessis, a type of ""unholy alliance"" existed in which the ablgophone minority in Quebec controlled business, the Catholic Church ran social services, and the National Union was allowed to govern. Following his death, there was a rather spontaneous Political shift through the 1960s and 70s through leaders such as Jean Lesage and, who saw Quebec as a nation within Canada and promoted secular nationalism. Contrarily, a movement in which Quebec was seen as being it's own country was also developed in the 1970s, lead by RenÃ© Levesque and resulting in a referendum. 

The changes  which saw Quebec became a Francophone dominant (economically) and secular society in this period are extremely contentious when looking at one or more causes. One leading theory centres around the fact that french culture was fading in Quebec to the point that in Montreal, it was difficult to receive service in french when shopping at a retail store downtown. Francophones were discriminated against in the workplace in favour of Anglophones, notably in high ranking positions where executives for big businesses were disproportionately English. This was all while the population was forced to be reliant on the Catholic Church for education and healthcare as the church had made an alliance with Anglo elites to maintain control. This was in an era that saw traditional conservative and religious values being replaced for free thought, such as the hippie movement and the Vietnam protests. When this system, spearheaded by Maurice Duplessis, collapsed following his death, it appeared that Quebec nationalism looked like somewhat of a ticking time bomb

While I unfortunately won't be able to give you an as much of an in depth response about why I eat meat, I can sum it up by saying this:

I eat meat because I do believe that the quality of animal protein is higher which means better recovery, it is more convenient for my lifestyle, and my training and energy levels are extremely good (if it ain't broke don't fix it to an extent). I also do focus on eating as as many plants as possible and ensure that the vast majority of my diet serves as recovery and fuel, with the occasional junk. I agree with you about everything regarding the environment, but my mentality about being more sustainable is that it is a lot easier to influence one person at the top (aka activism and lobbying, which I engage in) rather than leading by example to try and convince everyone around you which, although admirable, I view as inefficient.

PlantBasedDiet,fbi3w71,t1_fbi12sz,1576890044.0,"I would disagree, seeing as most egg studies tend to be correlational or observational research as opposed to causal experiments (which are admittedly extremely difficult when it comes to mortality), but most of the negative research (from what I've seen) such as this [study](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/digesting-the-latest-research-on-eggs-2019070317179) simply looks at mortality rates associating with eating eggs. I do agree however that egg yolks are high in cholesterol, and having more than 1-2 on a daily basis is less than optimal. Conversely, yolks are extremely nutritious as they have virtually every vitamin and mineral save vitamin c, which allows most people to have an easy way of getting nutrients. Once again, the increase in egg yolk consumption certainly isn't good, but I would stop far short of saying that consuming egg yolks in a diet that otherwise doesn't have much red meat or saturated fat causes long term negative effects.

Regarding cholesterol, the presumption that dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol being cause/effect isn't based on fact any more than dietary fat directly resulting in obesity, as shown right [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6024687/).

The report did say that red meat was the most significant factor in decaying health which I agree with, and I even mentioned that I include as little red meat as possible in my diet. I prefer to eat egg yolks ( there's a new report every other day as to whether they're good or bad, but I stick with 1 a day) in addition to mostly unsaturated fats to get my intake. I certainly agree that tofu and other non meat protein sources lack certain saturated fats, however the digestibility and bio availability of the protein is inferior to animal sources, which is why I still prefer them.

PlantBasedDiet,fbh4tqh,t1_fbh3xav,1576865322.0,"My diet is no red meat, minimal dairy apart from whey and 0% Greek yogurt. Most of my fats come from PB, avocado+ egg yolks. My protein consists largely of chicken, egg whites, shrimp (sometimes), turkey, pork every now and then, and one scoop of whey a day. For carbs, I don't eat much bread anymore (although when I did it was usually something like quinoa or chia or flax), but focus mostly on fruits, veggies, beans, and potatoes"
PlantBasedDiet,fbh3m06,t3_edad2f,1576864611.0,"To be perfectly honest, the reason most people feel so much better after having started a pbd is because they go from eating whatever is convenient to focusing on healthy plant based products. If you focus on lean meats, whole grains,nuts,seeds and lots of fruits and veggies with little processed crap and junk on an omnivorous diet, your performance will also likely improve. I'm not saying pbd is bad, but game changers is nothing short of propaganda. A well balanced pbd compared to a well balanced omnivore diet will give comparable results in terms of performance."

Motivation comes and goes with time, and eventually it's not enough. At this point, discipline has to do what motivation won't and get your ass going. As happy as I am that you're motivated, just be prepared that it likely won't last, and that you're able to stay in track when you feel like giving up, as discipline is the key to success."
