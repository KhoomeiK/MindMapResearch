suggestmeabook,f25lu4e,t3_dc2iqe,1569977805.0,"I started reading Discworld this year and this page helped me decide where to start: http://discworldreadingorder.azurewebsites.ne

Basically you can pick one of the contained series and start from there, since reading in chronological order is generally discouraged. 

I started reading mort and guards guards could also be a good start, the night watch series is excellent."

&#x200B;

Can I just use this at night and then sunscreen and be done?  Or do I need something else so my skin doesn't freak out?

My skin has never been sensitive or prone to pimples, although I have been having lots of pimples lately because a change in birth control (hence why im looking into skin care)"
Anxiety,ez1nvm8,t3_czqtqt,1567649343.0,"Yep. I started having gastrointenstinal problems due to anxiety when I was in high school and they got so bad that when I was in college I was diagnosed with IBS. 

The only thing that helped me get it under control was learn which foods to avoid and treat my anxiety, which for me was with medication. 

Now my stomach still gives me trouble, but not as bad as before."
