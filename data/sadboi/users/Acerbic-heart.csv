She should be supportive of his needs, like give him a call when she is out partying on vacation in Costa Rica. That’s what you do. It’s called respect. She has a lot of growing she needs to do, and I can’t even fathom how she thinks it’s a good idea to bring a child into this world. Like, why? So your kids can watch you be abusive to their father? She would fucking have a mental breakdown if she had a kid right now, that girl has a lot of work she needs to do on herself. She is the toxic person she keeps bitching about, and if she doesn’t own up to that, she will have a miserable life.
