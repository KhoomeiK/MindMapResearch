AskEurope,fpuylr3,t1_fpuy8g7,1588928371.0,"Theoretically anyone can learn any language in a degree that a native speaker does, but that would require a LOT of practice and very professional guidance. Most of the time it's just not worth the effort. After all, we the interlocutor undersands us, it's good enough no matter the small differences. I think the mispronounced melody of a word or a sentence is a bigger obstacle in understanding than the particular phonemes being pronounced wrong.

It's a bit like ""w"" and ""v"" in English. In Turkish you don't have the labial ""w"" so these two sounds are probably very close you. I noticed that even good English speakers from Turkey usually pronounce ""we"" more like ""ve"", so ""one"" sounds like ""van"". With this I can always spot a fellow Turk (I see Turkey as my second homeland) among English speaking people (or a Turk speaking Arabic for example where ""wa"" becomes ""ve""). Don't get me wrong, I don't mean it as an offence. I just find it interesting how our native language modifies the way we hear foreign words.

Despite growing up in a small town with little edutional facilities I was determined to learn perfect English, so with the help of locally available books (I think I knew them all by heart) and video games (likewise) I studied every day. After some time I considered myself very good at written English and my school records confirmed it. Alas, I had very few occasions to practice spoken English (if so, hardly ever with native speakers). With this in my naive childish heart I went to visit my family in London (I was 12 at the time). Gosh.. I immediately gave up on trying to speak like a local, but at least I wished I could understand what they were saying to me :)) That was a big lesson of humility :) (the next one came on my university exam with British teachers where it turned out that my written English was also not as good as I liked to believe). Now, after I learnt several other languages, I believe that English is a relatively easy language to learn, but quite hard to master. When I grew up, it occured to me that no one expects a foreigner to speak like a native - it's enough that you don't sound ridiculous and understand what people say ;)."
