Not necessarily to avoid his emotions, but more or less to gather his composure and to analyze his thoughts/emotions and whatever it was that caused them to get stirred. I personally can't take conflict either, esp. if it's unexpected. It's weird, because Caps get this reputation of being cold emotionless beings, but really we're anything but and are a sea of emotions! We just have a way of expressing our emotions a whole lot differently than other signs. When we say something, we mean it. When we feel something, we deeply feel it. There's no superficial flighty emotions with Caps, esp. when it comes to other people. It either is, or it isn't. So if a Cap is feeling some sort of way, you can trust that it's the real deal. I would say maybe try the same approach but without the need to be harsh about it. Just talk it out and express how it makes you feel. If you make it clear to him that whatever he is doing is bothering you, I'm sure he will work on trying to resolve it because of how much he cares for you."

twinflames,fowwxx5,t1_fov9mn5,1588128935.0,"Me personally, I feel like numbers are a way of showing you that you are on the path you're supposed to be on. I've seen numbers for a long time now, but they usually appear sporadically and at odd times. They may not always mean something great is about to happen in your life, because life just doesn't always quite work like that. But that you are more in tune with your true self and/or your true journey. Even if only a little bit! I think they reassure us that things will be okay."
twinflames,foww1kw,t1_fowlq86,1588128372.0,"I think they were referring to you counting numbers, with either numerology or gematria. I see numbers as signs too, but when it comes to calculating meanings, I don't do this often and don't think too much about it. I've done it with names, birthdays, etc. but it acts as a bottomless rabbit hole. You could add and reduce forever..and you will always be able to draw some similarities to practically anything."
