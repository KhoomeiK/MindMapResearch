fuckeatingdisorders,fi2o186,t3_f60qi9,1582084360.0,I literally feel the exact same thing and i hate myself currently for giving in and gaining so much... its so tiring wanting to eat non-stop and nothing else b rings me joy.
BingeEatingDisorder,fho6f2x,t1_fhjd2gb,1581743027.0,Yes and I end up trying to find more food or just finding it and eating it.
AskReddit,fhiebmn,t3_f38haa,1581623076.0,"Everything has to be made convenient for them. He was never willing to concede or ""sacrifice"" time or effort etc. Unless it was close to his apartment, specifically what he wanted, at the time he wanted, he would blow me off or make me go out of my way. I found myself always having to make the trip or having to do the work. I finally came to my senses and realized I was a complete idiot for letting him basically take advantage of me."
BingeEatingDisorder,fhi5n2h,t1_fhhx1o4,1581618210.0,I have not tried that... I think maybe I'll give it a try and see how i feel. Thank you!
BingeEatingDisorder,fhhivdo,t3_f2zv7s,1581605218.0,I'd totally be down!
BingeEatingDisorder,fhhguui,t3_f394mn,1581603894.0,cold canned chili.. right out of the can with a spoon. Also a whole pack of tortillas with mostly a full nutella jar.
BingeEatingDisorder,fhhg3zb,t1_fhhadqk,1581603378.0,I did this as well except I had to go to classes...worst day ever.
depression,fhebkud,t3_f2qwaw,1581518728.0,"This is exactly how I have been feeling and thought I was alone in it. Although its comforting in a way to find someone else who can relate, I am also really sorry you're also experiencing this. Honestly it is beyond frustrating and I'm just making stupid mistakes and not really even able to function half the time. It's terrifying and humiliating because people around me are like ""What the fuck is wrong with you?!?"" and I don't know what to do..."

lonely,fgocmys,t3_ezl25a,1580965680.0,"I‚Äôm sorry, that honestly sucks. I‚Äôve gone on bumble and every decent conversation I have with a guy turns into just never getting a reply or the same uninterested responses. Online dating is just a bunch of people wasting time I feel like."
BingeEatingDisorder,fgobs90,t3_ezhhcm,1580964963.0,Literally this is me right now and it‚Äôs exhausting..
BingeEatingDisorder,fg01a3q,t3_evqsis,1580397982.0,This is why I try to avoid pasta and/or most carbs in general because I get triggered by it and I know it‚Äôll most likely lead to a binge. I wish I could just eat like a normal person but unfortunately at the moment it‚Äôs not possible so I try my best to avoid those foods.
BingeEatingDisorder,fg00yg1,t3_evvesm,1580397772.0,This is really rude and disgusting for the other co-workers that were meant to share this cake.. but I feel really bad for her because I can see she‚Äôs in a frenzy.

fuckeatingdisorders,f9s40lp,t3_e6how0,1575585579.0,This has been happening to be constantly lately and its super irritating.. mostly because I feel like I ate a decent amount during the day but I still wake up wanting food. I've been told i should eat more through the day but that's hard..
BingeEatingDisorder,f893cf8,t3_dzocn2,1574366252.0,"Great job!!! keep it up, you've got this ;D"
fuckeatingdisorders,f88ln7a,t3_dzk8j9,1574356776.0,Awesome! You have definitely got this love ;) My stepmom gave me a kinder bueno and I ate it even though my brain was like HELL NAHHHHH. This post makes me feel better about it <3
BingeEatingDisorder,f7yhyxe,t3_dy4hok,1574095422.0,I feel this honestly... I feel that when I binge it isn't actually me. I feel like i have a wild person inside me that takes over and eats everything in sight. I come back to the mess left behind feeling horribly (physically and mentally) Its like I'm dealing with a problem child that I have to constantly clean up after...
EDRecovery_public,f7plrca,t3_dwdnh8,1573951111.0,"Literally the amount of hair that falls out, and how thin my hair has gotten is terrifying to me. I have this realization randomly a lot like ""fuck this.. i'm gonna eat to get my hair back"" but its still hard to stick to that."
EDRecovery_public,f7ou6j4,t3_dwu142,1573934400.0,"What did you do to get it back? I haven't had it in years, and I have been gaining and working hard to recover but I don't know what to do to get my period back.."
