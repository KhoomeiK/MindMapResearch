Whereas pc players can train for hours and hours and aim better than controller players easily. And for building, you literally have to press a button to go in build mode which isnâ€™t the case in mnk. And mnk pros have an edge at building and editing over controller players. And everyone who complains about aim on controller just try aiming on controller. Half an hour on an aim training map and your thumb starts to hurt"
