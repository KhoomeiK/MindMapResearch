I just want to say - thank you for posting. I've been desperate to talk and hear others experiences and was disappointed when I noticed that this page is just memed filled. I just want to talk to someone who's dealing with the same shit constantly. ðŸ’™"

My heart hurt reading about how sad you've been. If you're not already, highly recommend seeing someone professional to help. The amount of times I've been stressed at work and gone to reach for food is unreal. Keep on keeping dude! âœŒ"
