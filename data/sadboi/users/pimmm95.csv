No pity encouragements that everything's gonna be okay, just a simple hug. How can that be so hard to give... Still hoping someday someone will hear us out"
depression,fhrvr9y,t1_fhqg30c,1581841006.0,Exactly. Most people say it but doesnt really mean it

So my tour guide talked to him, and the reason why he said it's closed because I look like a fuckin chinese! And I'm not! Now next place I go I immediately tell them ""I'm Filipina, I'm no china!"" Hahahaha!"
depression,ffm9a8m,t3_eu2h1f,1580050856.0,"Happy birthday stranger! I know how lonely it feels especially on your day. 

Whenever it's my birthday I try to be alone and be with only myself. At first people will think it's sad, but really it helps me a lot to know myself better. I don't give a fuck whatever people thinks, I turn off everything and ran from the world. It's time for yourself. I love you.

PS, it's my birthday tomorrow."

Everyone i loved so much keeps on dying and leaving me. I just lost my dog today and what sucks more is i didnt had the chance to save him because im far away from home. Im a fckin useless human being"
depression,f9i5nyz,t1_f9hy6jq,1575328868.0,"Exactly!!! Few months ago I had the chance to overdose myself. Got a lot of pills, but it's just the guilt that stopping me from doing it. I dont know. Then my flatmate who turned out to be my best friend was the only person who was there for me, she was the only person who knows me, believes in me and probably the only living here on earth that cared for me. It gives me a little hope. And the thing is, i dont want her to feel bad that i die on her side. I'm so tired, i really want to give up now. I dont see any worth in me, no purpose to stay anymore. Just the guilt."

But after sometime I still go back to drinking and crying all alone at my room. Don't know what's wrong with my life. It just feels like if I'm going to die, no one will care, no one will notice. I'm still trying to fight with this, everyday, trying to remind myself that I'm still useful!!! But whenever I try to do something good, there is always that one person who will fuck you up and make you realize your just a shit! I'm so tired with life, my useless job, dealing with people who treats you that you are worthless and keeps stepping on you. I just don't know what to do anymore.. But i will still try"
tretinoin,f94m7oq,t3_e3a53m,1575093212.0,"Been there, I know the feeling! If you see my past post I had very dry and flaky skin when I started Tret. Now my skin is so much better when I started buffing my tret and do it every other day. And the most important thing, I used this Sukin Hydration Elixir Oil 20mins before tret application. Trust me, it will save you! üòâ"
tretinoin,f94lvka,t3_e3iilm,1575092844.0,"First of all be careful when using tret. Make sure you don't put anything near your eyes as it is very sensitive. And it's better to start off just every other day, because your skin might be very dry when you use it everyday. Also, products you will use must be alcohol free. Here is my daily routine.

AM
Cetaphil sensitive face wash--
Pixi Rose + Hada Labo Premium toner--
Sukin Hydration Elixir Oil (wait 20 mins)--
Clinique Moisturizer--
Avene SPF 50+

PM
Cetaphil sensitive face wash--
Pixi Rose + Hada Labo Premium toner--
Sukin Hydration Elixir Oil (wait 20 mins)--
Tret .05 (wait 10mins) (applied every other day)--
Clinique Moisturizer"
tretinoin,f8o4uyu,t1_f8mqli7,1574662920.0,Do you put tret every night? I changed my application to every 2 days because my face was drying a lot even though I put so much moisturizer and hydrating oil.

I'm currently using Clinique Moisturizer but it doesnt keep my face hydrated so I'm trying to find better options. I'll try your suggestion with Aquaphor + Vanicream though, really hope it works for me."
tretinoin,f8156ie,t1_f7ysudk,1574150641.0,Any better suggestions? I'm using Clinique moisturizer and Avene Emulsion SPF50.
