I did distance myself from that word because of the negative connotations it held with the whole sexual part of the fandom. Honestly I dont even call myself a furry now yet Im practicing furry art for fun. 

Its more of a personal thing that im keepjng to myself so I dont get judged by assholes. Im sure you understand that aspect of it"

So what I do to practice people and poses, is going on Pinterest and searching female/male models(whatever you want to draw) I just do multiple drawings of different models in different poses. I also had the privilege of being in a life art class. I was able to draw a model in real time. 

Ahelpful website that ive found is

You can choose whether or not you want nude or clothed and can also change how long you will see each picture. Its a great exercise!"

Also time consuming? So many people are on lockdown at the moment. They should have all the time they need, all the laundry they need. Staying inside social distancing from everyone.

The majority of people working at my factory are in their 60s. They are most at tisk of death.  Hospitals are filling. There arent many tests available where I live.

Anxiety,fgexez7,t3_ey2uvh,1580713831.0,"Well, when I had a job at Applebees, I was a cook. The work is highly fast pace and loud as hell.(ceramic plates banging, crashing to the floor sometimes, waiters and waitresses constantly yelling for more condiments and people yelling at you for how long you have on the food.) I had about 3 anxiety attacks while working there. I was miserable and felt stupid for acting like that in front of my coworkers. I felt like a weak person. Everyone started treating me like a dainty flower afterthe attacks and I felt inferior to all of them. Sometimes i would come in at 11am and get out at 1am without them letting me know I was going to be there that long. Eventually I had enough and I quit. I went somewhere different. Much less demanding work. It was boring production work. I didnt have any anxiety attacks there. I was bored as hell but anything was better than feeling the sensory overload I felt at Applebees.

My question is: Was the type of work your job required too much for you personally? Do you feel your work environment had too many triggers? 

Maybe you can try another job that doesnt involve too many triggers.

Also im so sorry you are in the situation you are in. Im sure you feel lonely at times and i want you to know I understand. I may not have had the same situation as you at all but you are not alone in how you feel.

Anxiety,essb0hf,t1_esrx190,1562248549.0,"Yes I happy for all the stuff coming. I'm just tired of feeling anxious and crying. I just wanted a mother figure to be sympathetic to how I feel. Instead i got told to suck it up because she had it worse than me. She never acknowledges my feelings and she laughs at me for having different opinions. Everytime I talk about how I feel like she doesn't seem to ask how I'm doing she just goes, ""hah, well I'm not sure what is so bad about your life.""

We even got into a huge fight about it. I snapped and started yelling at her when she gave me a condescending laugh. I ended up having to call my dad and tell him what happened. He understood. He told me about when he was my age. He told me how he wanted to die at my age because he was so stressed. He didnt belittle me for being upset about my situation. He only gave me the advice he could hand to me. He was upset my mom was acting and called her so damn hard headed.

I'm not saying I have a bad life. But even the best life doesnt stop you from having anxiety and depression. Recently a kid from my graduating year took his life. He had just gotten his own place and everything. He had a better life than a lot of people. Yet he still took his life. He still had emotional and mental turmoil that drove him to this point. This effected me greatly. I didnt know him but it woke me up to reality of how easy things could change to shit.

My mother doesn't worry about me. She doesnt know what goes on in my mind. No I'm not suicidal but yeah I wish I could die sometimes. She doesnt care. She doesnt care to know."

The religious are the ones looking for what they want to hear. We see time and time again their arguements being debunked and the goal posts moving.

I shared this because I found it interesting to see how the religious mind works. It's really gross and works like a cult. I, like a lot of other athiests came from a religious past and used to think this way. I believed everyone else was blinded and foolish for living their godless lives.
