It’s a slippery slope. It becomes all-consuming— there’s a lot of elements that could lead to a very unhealthy relationship with food. 

There were a few people I revered in that community that seemed very cautious and mindful of this, often helping me create a balance. I hope this can be the trend and not the exception in this saturated market for influencers :/

He was an online poker player and found success as an influencer of sorts himself. Then he gained a reputation of basically scamming people (he played under different accounts, a controversial method that got him kicked off major sites). He was always trying to frantically rebrand in the same way Caro makes her bbs: sitting on the floor with a mess surrounding him but ideas BUZZING.  He was enlightened with new things all the time, kicked a lot of bad habits for a little while but he never actually really finished any grandiose idea he started.  He pushed a lot of people away in the process because he was so consumed by this rebranding and couldn’t deliver the things he promised.

Sound familiar?! Lol 

I think she’ll have to let go of being on the defense, and all the nostalgia and the times she “peaked.” She’ll have to commit to things, show up. She could even move to vlogging on YouTube. She’ll have to address her reputation and negativity without obsessing over it. She could use her vulnerability and writing towards good things but she’s too consumed with herself and it’s like this half-ass self-awareness.

Sorry for the long response - it just kills me that she keeps running into the same pattern because I know that pattern so well from my ex."
