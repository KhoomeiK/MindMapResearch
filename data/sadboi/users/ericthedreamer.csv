So it might be an issue with your Internet, browser, or iPhone. You can try manually disabling Flash plugin in Chrome or your preferred browser to see if that helps resolve the issue. Or in the worst case, manually transfer audio files from your laptop to your phone. Hopefully those troubleshooting tips help. Good luck."
