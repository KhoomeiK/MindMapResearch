I am able to afford to buy things that I want and even travel. But none of this makes me happy. I hate the city I live in. I hate my job. I hate myself as well. I also never have gotten promoted at any job and people that are new have gotten a higher position than me every single time! In my case I know it's cause I don't care and I am not a people person. I know I work hard though. But they don't see it.

I just want to be happy."
