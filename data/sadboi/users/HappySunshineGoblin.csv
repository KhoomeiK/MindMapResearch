I've done my own maths and find the same sort of prices: one loaf can cost me about 10p. The cheapest bread at the shop is usually £1 so that's a 90% saving! Flour is incredibly cheap, and bread is really easy to modify and make different types. 

But you're right, the cost is effort.  I don't have a bread maker, but I don't find kneading by hand a problem - you can do it while watching Tv or having a conversation. The wait times are the issue for me. A yeast based bread needs to be left to rise a long time. Soda bread is very speedy in comparison, but I would still struggle to have it measured, kneaded and baked early in the morning, which is when I need it for breakfast and packed lunches.  Nowadays I'm buying sliced loaves at the supermarket for those things and make my own bread when I have more time to put in the efforts, like at weekends. 

I think though I'm going to experiment with measuring out the ingredients in batches in advance. If I only had to mix and knead, I could probably find time make bread every day! I'm also going to see if it's still lovely if made the night before.
