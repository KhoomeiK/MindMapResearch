Key is to get ahead and stick to a schedule and that's it. You can even give yourself flexibility if ahead to do stuff within a span of few days when you want. Again more work, but for antisocial anxiety plagued person like me, online classes were a godsend. Writing papers should be easy at this point also.

Sometimes a late reply like this, with the right timing can really make someone's day like your reply right now (honestly has been a rough day). I can't tell how you great it makes me feel to hear my strategy has helped. It's not even ""my"" strategy of just trying to be your best dj for your own listening to improve your exercise and life. I do this for waking up and showers and to help my mood especially in morning and at night. The awareness I've gained about how I'm lowest when I'm most tired and most reflective at the start and end of each day has helped me by trying to work at that by trying remedies. Sometimes I will just eat really bad cheat breakfast on tough morning, or stay up a little late watching a comedy. I wish more ppl used music this way too though w/ exercise so make sure to spread the love and encourage other ppl this way. Ppl need to have more of a loving relationship with their music bc it's medicinal in so many ways. Ppl w serious dementia cannot remember their past, but in this documentary it was shown that if you play songs from their past they remember! Studies have been done to show music can help you recover better too. I thing there is great untapped magic and power in music. Also, songs have deep meaning, and it's okay to sometimes not listen to super fresh new stuff but to replay old favs and really get lost in your thoughts or especially your imagination. I often enjoy trying to imagine different music videos for songs in my mind. I have a cpl songs that are like my battle cry and are like my walkout song if you will if I was a fighter lol, but I like to imagine I'm like a hero in the stories or movies I watch sometimes where I fight off and protect the aliens. Be wild w/ your imagination. And lastly, I can't tell you how much this inspires me. I often will look at the bodybuilder or marathon runner and get so inspired bc they are going so hard and pushing themselves so hard, but I found myself in recent yrs getting inspired more by ppl have been tested harder like you w your injury or ppl who are starting for the first time or starting back again and have struggled and maybe still struggle to do it. I worry so much that they let the social bs about what others think affect them. The guy pushing 1000 pounds is so capable physically, and knows he can do it, it isn't hard outside the set to believe. The person just starting up or dealing w big injury (which I went through too once) is much more badass to me and I just wish more and more ppl could feel the love and support ppl really have for them so that they believe in themselves like they really should. Coming back from injury is Rocky shit. Ain't nobody understand your grind. Please keep it going, you're not just helping yourself. Ppl recognize."

But I'm not sure this ""dopamine fasting"" has to be construed as that just in the activities described I mean. Yoga stretching is exercise. And reading and meditating is said to boost dopamine, though maybe not during? Not sure though if like a crazy sci fi novel you're super into. It seems like more a practice in willpower, discipline, and mindfulness. Also, I'm guessing the meditation is meant to be spiritual and not geared towards starving of dopamine but more towards altruistic pursuit of sending love out into the air or whatever or like strengthening the soul or something, idk."

He fuckin must win or Trump and GOP will ensure end of the world."
esist,fmhsewa,t1_fmhkp8w,1586092122.0,"Lol def wasn't trying to do look into your feelings. Just need to try to be optimistic. Not possible for me to hate GOP politicians, media, or supporters anymore than already do. They're all pure scum. And I don't think yelling at them or talking to them does anything. They just get more and more stupid and evil. I am just saying focus on solutions rather than problems. But I guess part of that is still yelling at the evil GOP when they do more evil. Strike is a nice idea. I just think all I have left is to hope Biden wins."
esist,fmhdig3,t1_fmgr51r,1586075698.0,"Don't apologize, and I voted for Bernie, but lets not be too pessimistic about Biden, he knows he needs Bernie voters and progressives and knows the party is leaning this way. We need winners at all costs and we need a winner who is going to look to help destroy the GOP and help win back the senate from these evil scumags. I don't think Biden is that bad, and no other choice. Plus he will listen to his constituents and we will have a voice w someone like him. All the attacks on Obama and his son, I think he is game. We need more optimism he can get the W for us or we are surely doomed."
esist,fmhd5ll,t1_fmh56lw,1586075293.0,"We have every right to feel outrage and lots of other feelings by the entire insanity of this presidency, the GOP, their media and supporters, and their disgusting handling of this all. But all we can do is try to look forward to the election and hopefully Biden wins and change can happen. I'm worried about the corruption and cheating, but I think the money and backing should be there. Too many good ppl don't want this and we have a lot on our side. Can't lose hope when there is a good chance we can get him out soon. The damage has been crazy and they're insistent on making things worse at every turn, but it's not surprising and there is still the hope of Biden winning and maybe the regression can finally stop."
esist,fmgu3m2,t3_furf8b,1586057867.0,I tried calling comcast and literally cannot get any kind of agent on the phone. Looks like they're trying to stop ppl from complaining to billing about their crazy high bills during this time to get some relief but would rather not help ppl. They at least are acting like they're going to try to pay their workers for now which is something.

MMA,fm6z4l9,t1_fm5brf0,1585807668.0,"Not disagreeing at all, but it seemed like that was the plan and his plan until recently, like if it hadn't taken this long to maybe see if he can get out of the country, he would've gone through with it. He deserves no blame regardless. Just saying maybe with better timing it might've worked out."
esist,flw3zff,t3_fr99u8,1585539052.0,"There should be a website with Fox News and GOP politicians and other ""media"" members worst quotes.

nba,flsywim,t1_fls6jkr,1585454415.0,I think some of these Mavs fans are just racist hick Trump supporters and get upset about the whole trans thing bc hatred is the whole foundation to the culture of the hicks.

esist,flpz64e,t3_fq878g,1585373287.0,"Doing God's work. Unfortunately racist hick trash would rather die of Coronavirus than not get to hate immigrants and minorities like with what Trump and the GOP and the alt right sells them. Tucker calls immigrants dirty. Rand Paul calls them non ppl. Anne Coulter is famous. This is what sells and it's all they care about. Not guns, not abortion, or fake religion bs. Dirty soulless racist hicks are buying in for the hate. And these kinds of videos and truthful statements or logic makes them more motivated. Bc it means they get to deny truth and what's right to hate on the libs or ppl who are different. And if the lib happens to be a non white that's the biggest plus imaginable. There really needs to be a long term plan created to leave these ppl behind in the future. They vote to make things worse in every possible way imaginable especially for a crisis like this and if it hurts themselves. If them voting for Trump who obviously can't handle a crisis and has done everything imaginable to make it worse almost like he and demon Pence (who had his try at speading HIV in his own state and said smoking doesn't kill in a op ed like pure demon filth and now this) work for Satan, makes our survival as a human race this difficult with their greed and stupidity w this crisis, their denial of climate change science which is connected and still another threat, and their total corruption, regression at every turn and hatred, then they should be cured along w/ the coronavirus. I don't mean that in any crazy terms, and wish it could be different. I just want coal miners for instance who support Trump to be left behind, and not be given any other opportunity. If there's a way to leave these ppl behind long term and especially their money, that should be the plan. Lets not kid ourselves, dirty racist christian hicks don't give af about anything or anyone and only care about hate. None of this will change them even when it affects them. They choose hate culture bc they've done so their entire lives and won't put down their drug of fox news or alt right Infowars lying evil hateful filth."

It's sickening bc they buy in for that immigrant and minority hate. It's why Tucker calls immigrants dirty and Rand Paul calls them non-people. It's what sells the most and distracts away from the trickle down and murdercare and corporatist greed that goes against their self interests just like this bs bill McConnell that hick demon bitch just put forth. These ppl don't have souls. It's just like the Kentucky hick who said he knew he'd die w/o Obamacare and w Trump repealing it he'd be left w nothing and die and he knew that and still voted for trump anyways. These aren't ppl, these are the confederates descendants from the Civil War who have arguably gotten worse."

MMA,fkz6342,t1_fkyezxz,1584663600.0,"I think the instigator label is just a bad wrap. I think his producers probably encourage him about this especially bc so many fighters just don't draw anyone's attention. Yeah it's annoying tactic, but I'm guessing definitely draws more attention. And him not being into MMA is crazy. Basketball is also my favorite sport. But NFL and MMA at any moment can feel like the real favorite. There's just no way you're right about him not appreciating like you claim. But I think the big point you left out is he does the best interviews w/ fighters. I barely pay attention to MMA journalism podcasts and videos of interviews but if I do pay attention it's to see Ariel interview someone like Conor, Diaz brothers, or like Chael back in the day. Someone he doesn't need to do any instigating w/ bc they don't need to to get attention."
heat,fkyondl,t3_flfz4t,1584652951.0,"When he made the comment about his son not getting playing time the NBA thread was pure cancer. Like I get it it's a competitive team w a lot of talent, but he is still his fucking dad. He's supposed to complain even if his son maybe doesn't deserve more playing time. Lot of salty Mavs fans in there for sure too, which is crazy bc it's all bs and on top of that if Shaq was called fairly it would've been much  more lopsided. I hate how they call him a dirty player too. Such bs. They saw the Kobe all star play like he intentionally tried to hit his nose while trying to play great D. It's insane."
