with felony assault charges and go completely nucking futs because as a female half his size with ZERO criminal history--it makes sense that the only chance you have is when he's sleeping....

Is this funny? Hell yes.
Does it end well for ANYONE? Nope.
Just leave."

This movie shook me to my core."

No not really
No not really 
No not really

Bonus points if I chuckle to myself a bit afterwards and someone is around to hear it. Yeah....."
BPD,fb9k5gv,t3_ec6gv9,1576640762.0,OMG you are me hero right now. ‚ù§
BPD,fb4mkew,t1_fb4bm3g,1576511733.0,"Thank you. It has been difficult to say the least but OHMYGOD that sense of panicked relief was quite nice after months....
I would suggest not worrying about getting any info ""correct"" but try to stick to concrete facts...just so a pattern has the chance to appear if there is one. Our FP lives in a rose colored glass bubble, but if they are the only one that's got you 2nd guessing enough to post on Reddit--my guess is that you're on to something.
I was lucky enough that it got physically abusive one time...that was enough for my launch into overdrive sleuthing of narc behavior and replaying of past relationships to connect the dots. And even then it took 2 weeks to muster the courage up to break it off and then love bomb him within a couple of hours begging to get back together. By that time, he took the reins and stuck to getting rid of me...be strong, you are not in the wrong to validate your feelings!"
BPD,fb3p2mb,t1_fb3nc0y,1576481818.0,That and/or gaslighting as well...??
BPD,fb3otwt,t3_eb8zu8,1576481498.0,"Document everything that you feel could help and keep it in a private safe place....
Date and time of events, triggers, feelings, rabbit holes of thoughts, rants, poems, etc.. if you are being emotionally manipulated it should help show that pattern. Hopefully things will become clearer after rereading everything several different times.

I knew nothing about how low I could feel after a similar situation with my FP. Mind loops and replaying events OVERANDOVERANDOVER...I started new coping crap ie rocking/tapping constantly, memory loss and fog, tremors, face twitches, random body pains, hypervigilance, pulling out my hair, walking in small circles for for hours...etc yeah. 
Journaling helped ground me long enough to analyze patterns of behavior. I hope you get the answers that you need to make an informed decision on how to proceed."

This is my version of peace. Words and thoughts never seem to quite line up, and there's more to things than the eye can see. Freedom to wander through melancholic beauty and be as curious, adventurous, and solitary as I choose. Heaven."
Empaths,fab8gmf,t3_e8b389,1575919346.0,"Ive been feeling like that a lot too, maybe bc of the holidays? 
Seems to me most people don't say anything after their energy changes. I try to stay away from mentioning what ive noticed out of respect for their space. Unless it could be something I've done or said and just need to clarify. There's a lot of emotion and feeling floating around this time of year...?"
BPD,f8md71q,t1_f8mcd84,1574630256.0,I'm sorry that things are shit. I hope they do too.
BPD,f8m3alq,t1_f8lbw3z,1574627774.0,"Dude, you're hella self-aware. But I totally get everything you just said....I realized that I was staying little because: little things are taken care of and handled gently. In my head, unless I'm small nobody will treat me that way."
BPD,f8m128o,t3_e11kft,1574627206.0,"I used to think that I was living a ""normal"" life but after my self-destructiveness/addictions took me down 3 years ago...I'm starting over. 
Now? I don't have friends. I don't speak to my family. I dont work. I think about all the terrible things that would hurt LESS than being so lonely. But my inner conciousness and imagination have blossomed, and I am trying to learn to take what comes. I look back on where I was before and maybe this version of what I'm destined for isn't so bad. I dont know."
