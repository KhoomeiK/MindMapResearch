I left in 2017, and even then the quotas were becoming ridiculous (some of the fault lay with AT&T’s expectations for resellers to be fair) and I’ve heard it’s only gotten worse since then. 

As far as tips, if you have sales experience I would highlight what made you successful, give examples. Wireless sales in general is big on conversion rate, so talking about ways to convert every person that walks through the door into a sale is music to their ears - e.g. someone comes in for a bill payment, offer to do an account analysis which may open the door to pitching upgrades, activations, new services, etc. Accessory sales were also big, I’m assuming they still are. So bundling is something that we leaned heavily on - “sure you can buy just a case but if you buy 3 or more accessories I can give you a 15% discount”, etc. Also highlighting how much it would cost to replace their device to drive insurance and accessory sales. Show that you have the mindset to turn 1 opp (opportunity - activation, upgrade, internet, Directv, etc) into many. If you’re selling an iPhone, bundle it with an iPad. If you’re a selling a galaxy, bundle it with a Galaxy watch and Galaxy tab.

Like I said, it’s not a job I would recommend but sometimes you just need a job and I get that. My biggest piece of advice if you do get it, is keep looking for something better from day 1."

I understand they are trying to weed out “low value” customers but do they really think that losing a substantial % of their customer base is going to equal more profits? Meanwhile the reason they claim to have bought Directv was because it would give them more bargaining power with the networks but if they continue to lose customers there goes their leverage.

Further, even with arm’s-length negotiations among the operating companies, the elimination of the double margin will reduce price pressure because **AT&T can reduce the profit requirements on the communications company, which allows it to pass cost reductions on to consumers**. See Tr. 3503:24-3504:18 (Stephenson (AT&T)).”

Once you zoom in the majority of it is fair and from experience I can tell you it’s unusable. They added 2 towers to “cover” a 40 mile stretch of highway - 40. This was in 2017. That would be fine if it were just a starting point and they were going to come back and fill in coverage but it’s now almost 2 years later and no further progress."
tmobile,esurfhp,t3_c96ay1,1562287891.0,Nope. That map shows GA as being almost completely covered and there are many many many spots with no coverage.

I recently went through something similar and had a very similar outcome - got the job, better pay, great healthcare, etc. At first, I did have the *starting a new job anxiety* but I got into a groove and you will too and everything is going to work out great 👍"
learnprogramming,esat4e0,t3_c6iuwf,1561768052.0,Definitely interested!
verizon,es7qfuv,t3_c67etj,1561677069.0,If only they would actually expand fios 😒 And I can understand Uverse scoring so low since it’s just glorified DSL but AT&T fiber only scored marginally higher??
ATT,err46cw,t3_c3etuw,1561159765.0,Holy folders Batman!
tmobile,erll02i,t3_c2jpcp,1560990004.0,The last time I was there congestion was terrible on both AT&T and Verizon so wouldn’t be surprised if T-Mo was the same.
ATT,eoh57l0,t3_brpiux,1558573156.0,Sounds like an authorized retail store
