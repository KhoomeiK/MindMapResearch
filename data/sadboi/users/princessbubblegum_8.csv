My mom is in the high risk group, if she gets infected she could easily die. I live with her and therefore i have a big responsibility, but I can’t handle it. It’s my birthday soon and I have a boyfriend I would give everything to be with but I can’t. I already have depression and severe anxiety and I just cant handle this anymore. I want my life back. I want to give my boyfriend a kiss when I turn 19. I want to give my father a hug on my birthday but I can’t (my parents are separated). I know a lot of people have lost family and I should not be whining about my birthday. I have just had enough of this. I really just wanna talk with somebody, maybe you have some good ideas on what to do. Maybe you can comfort me and I can comfort you. Maybe you too are depressed of anxious and know where I’m coming from. We need to help each other in this shitty time, I wanna help everybody, but today I’m the one who needs help."

I celebrated today because I took a bath and brushed my teeth and i was so proud. Celebrate all the time and every single victory and write them down! Some day the victories will get bigger and bigger, but don’t think about that, just do the smallest thing tomorrow and be proud.

I really really hope that you somehow will find the courage to say fuck the world and just focus on you. Just take one ducking second at a time and do exactly what you want with it! 
I feel your words in my heart and I’m fed up too. I have so much anger, that’s why I wanna try boxing. 

If you listen to your heart, then what is your dream? How do you wanna live? Then when you have found out take one small step. Maybe you’ll take a step a week, and then one a day. It doesn’t matter! Just keep moving and believing and you will get there!!"
