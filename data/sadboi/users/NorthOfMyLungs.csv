Tylenol is an extremely dangerous medication to overdose on and can cause liver failure. it's actually THE MOST COMMON CAUSE of liver failure. one very tricky feature is that unlike many substances you could overdose on, the time of onset is very delayed. this is both a blessing sometimes- as basically anyone who gets to an ER in 8 hours post overdose is fine, but even people who die often do not have any symptoms for more than 24 hours and by that point it is too late and can cause several days of slow painful death by liver failure. there is an antidote to Tylenol overdose. if you had a massive overdose, or were delayed in getting to the ER you usually get admitted to ICU for administration of the antidote. only 4% of Tylenol overdoses lead to liver toxicity at all. its still an incredibly dangerous medication and shouldn't be fucked with, and also if you attempt suicide in the US there is almost zero chance youre going anywhere but a psych hospital/unit next. but if she called immediately after a Tylenol OD, its profoundly unlikely she sustained liver damage unless your friend was so incompetent in the appropriate care he would have lost his license.  


I have lost acquaintances to Tylenol ODs. including numerous folks who had zero symptoms in the first 24 hours until it was too late to reverse the overdose. I have attempted suicide full well intending to die of liver failure and unintentionally ended up being found and brought to the hospital 10 hours later. I was told I was going to die and asked by my nurse if I wanted to see a priest. I ended up in the ICU for a week and was told it made no medical sense that I recovered. trying really fucking hard to stay alive. 

suicide is strange, and injuries in general. the human body is at once fragile and resilient. I have spent too much of my life in psychiatric hospitals and have friends who have survived hanging attempts, being hit by trucks, jumping from bridges, electric shock, setting themselves on fire, carbon monoxide poisoning, all kinds of overdoses/poisoning (bleach, heroin, rat poison etc), jumping from building, jumping from moving car, drowning attempts, shooting oneself in the head... and yet you can get killed by dumb shit like jogging and a fucking branch snaps and hits you, or slipping on an icy drive way and hitting your head. 9 of my friends have killed themselves. trying to make the best of the time I have."
AskReddit,fg2emv2,t3_ewd85r,1580443549.0,"A year ago I very unexpectedly found myself experiencing domestic violence after my best friend was being a jack ass and disappeared from my life, my therapist being incredibly inappropriate, and the fall out in getting a restraining order etc was brutal. I did attempt suicide, numerous times. the bar in the closet gave little margin for error in exactly how much slack the rope had. I kept just barely having my toes touch the ground.

I would have missed getting to see my grandparents for the first time in 5 years. I would have missed getting to spend one of my grandfather's last good weeks with him, staying up late playing cards, and holding his hand while he died, being a pall barer at his funeral.

&#x200B;

I would have missed kissing my grandmother on Christmas and her reassuring me I am welcome in the family as a transgender person.

I would have missed a fantastic road trip with one of my closest friends this summer.

I would have missed hiking to one of the peaks of a small mountain with friends. I would have missed protests that let me feel seen again. I would have missed nights out dancing. I would have missed white water tubing, and some incredible small scale performances.

I would have missed clearing my background checks and training to start a volunteer position advocating for an incredible young person.

I would have missed some of my health issues that were causing me to need to be in the emergency room as often as 5 days a week getting dramatically better.

shit is really fucking hard, and I am going through a lot right now and have been on the verge of ending my life the last month. but I'm so grateful for some of the beautiful moments this year."
