It’s so difficult balancing two entirely different worlds. Having family that doesn’t understand that adhd, depression, and anxiety are real makes it even worse. I’ll be honest, I had a horrible time growing up with school, relationships, and developed really low self esteem. 

My first time ever going to see a therapist, I got diagnosed with mild depression. It wasn’t until my second semester of nursing school they I started looking into ADHD more and then asked my new therapist to let me take the tests. 

I still feel like a lot of my potential has been wasted bc I wasn’t diagnosed early enough. But I think about it, it’s ok bc my family wasn’t really that aware. They are starting to be more understanding tho. 

We seriously need to have a group thing for us!"
