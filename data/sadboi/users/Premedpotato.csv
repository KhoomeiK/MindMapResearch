college,fmh9386,t3_fv68dl,1586070918.0,"My story is pretty simple. I went to community college right out of highschool with the mental maturity of a 14 year old. I also struggle with schizoaffective so it was a recipe for disaster. Spent a sold two years skipping class, getting high, and sleeping. So much sleeping. Btw my parents funded this whole process. I am ashamed of how I took advantage of them. Eventually something traumatic happened and that combined with me failing in general caused me to drop out.

I spent a couple years working in food service (still do), learning to become more financially independent, and managing my illness. After a while I just felt like I was wasting my time. I missed learning. I remember one day at work we had the manager come in to show us the new way of making hoagies. This lady literally held up a hoagie roll, pointed to each part and defined each section of the bread. This lesson was labeled anatomy of a hoagie. That was honestly the point in my life where I was like ""I can't do this anymore."" The only thing I was learning about was damn sandwiches. This was a shame because I've always been a curious person who liked learning new things in general.

Eventually, I searched up the cheapest college in my state. I applied, got accepted, and had enough money saved up to go. I was previously a computer security major at community college (guidance counselors think some vague interest can turn into a career) but now I'm a psychology major which is something I learned I have been passionate about my whole life. Now that I'm here, it means so much to me. I feel like I'm finally in a place where my creativity and curiosity is appreciated and encouraged. It feels like I'm exactly where I should be.

Also this isn't a diss to food service workers. Managers make mad money and I know a lot of them are happy with their job. It's just not for me."

As for your mom denying it. That is common. My mom comes from a different culture where mental illnesses are instead seen as negative personality traits ie: depression=lazy. If that's not in the case in your situation, it could also be the fact that it's hard to accept. Acknowledging your child has a lifelong and at times debilitating illness is terrifying.
