Saying please and thank you, unless he is asking someone for help.  Things like that, so he comes of a rude ass hole... come to think of that seems to be the root of it for a lot the adults.

psychotherapy,fj7pwcr,t1_fj6xhia,1583095685.0,"I simply disagree with you and that is the way it is. It's not a matter of shaming someone.  It's a matter of reality.  Just because someone wants to work a particular job and may have a natural nack for that field doesn't always mean it is the right job for them.  You are also assuming that there isn't more to the story then I am posting.  WHATEVER field/job/career someone works they have to be able to handle the work load.  Otherwise bad things are going to happen personally and professionally. It can lead to burnout and self doubt.  Maybe there is another position within the field of mental health and/or social services that would be a better fit for that particular person.  Maybe working in another field completely and volunteering as a CASA worker would be better for that person.  If you think that is shaming, then I see that as some who thinks therapists are better then others.  
 I'm not saying 120 clients is a healthy case load. It's an awful caseload.  I'm not saying that we should put up with agency who treat their staff as disposable machines whose only purpose in life is to make money for the agency."

You would have been diagnosed with one of 3 subtypes of ADHD.  ADD has not been a real/accurate diagnosis since the late 80's/ early 90's when the DSM-4 came out.  The sub types are...

This is totally safe for use around pets and kids that lick everything, but if you have and exoskeleton it dissolves you from the outside.  I keep a can in my desk, not only for preventative spraying once every few months but to show clients.  BEST SHIT EVER.

There are also all sorts of homemade traps online.  I personally wouldn't use them for treatment but to find out if I had them.  The bugs are attracted to the carbon dioxide we exhale so the traps work by using different things that produce carbon dioxide to attract the bugs."

I married with the naive thought he would get better as he got older but he just got worse.  He has so much baggage stemming from chilhood to unpack for him to ever hope to be happy."
Divorce,f1i3t32,t1_f1gwo5s,1569505517.0,"No, rule is either back to a point where you feel you could do thing differently and try to safe the marriage or forward past the searing pain"
Divorce,f1i3j1w,t1_f1gtl2y,1569505398.0,"Ah, but you get to fast forward through the process.  So you get all the benefits but you dont have to live with the searing pain every day"
Divorce,f1i34xt,t1_f1gyurk,1569505231.0,"I'm not looking at it as pain shopping.  I'm trying to figure out my role in everything.  Was there a point were me changing anything would have mattered?  He was messed up from never working through his childhood baggage and not admitting that he was depressed.  So I wonder if he was ever capable of being the equal partner that I need.  I'm not saying that I was perfect, but would it even have mattered."
Divorce,f16ehc2,t1_f16e2uy,1569210034.0,Yeah.  He just got fucked up being adopted and abandoned 3 times the first year of his life.  He does like change.  I know we both feel guilty for the crap that happened before my... other... to fresh cant say it... got him. But this helped thanks
Divorce,f1620rv,t3_d7qxog,1569200769.0,How can you hate someone so much and at the same time love them so much?
Divorce,f15jpy6,t1_f15iyko,1569191515.0," I have no doubt that we could've have made it work if he just could've pulled head out of the past long enough to see where he was going. The way thing were wasnt working but he is so stuck in the past and not just from our marriage, but his own family crap.  I see him as giving up and running away."
Divorce,f15hons,t1_f15gn97,1569190698.0,"I've thought  about that.  But I dont know if it would be good for our dog.  He is a very high stress dog.  I feel like he needs stability.  Besides I plan to move about 2 hours away in 6 month timeline.  There is nothing for me here.  All that was was keeping me here was his refusal to consider moving. 

I dont know if we will ever be able to get alone that well.  He says he still loves me and doesn't want me out of his life.  But I am so angry and hurt I dont think I will ever be able to do that.  This is definitely not a mutual divorce.  What has lead to you and your ex being able to get along?"
Divorce,f14d02p,t1_f149mbu,1569172666.0,"Yup, his mind is made up"
Divorce,f1454i2,t1_f144iex,1569169653.0,"That's part of my problem. I dont know what the best decision for the dog would be.  He tends to shut done more, but his best friend and the dog is also attached to him would still be in the dogs life so that's only losing one familiar person versus two."
Divorce,f13m8mm,t1_f13llba,1569162264.0,Counseling since March and hes got his own. He admitted he was only there to check a box.  I had been trying to get him to see we had problems and do counseling and he refused to to accept anything.  But once he decide that things weren't good all he wanted to do was quit and run.
relationship_advice,f08fq0d,t1_f08czh8,1568480958.0,The type of person that says a 13 year old kid should be excited about getting sexually assaulted and is weird if he isn't
relationship_advice,f08cmnm,t1_f087osu,1568479499.0,"All my posts have a theme.  Maybe this is happened to him and he is struggling to figure out why charges  weren't pressed.  Maybe you are the ""high 5 man"" type."
relationship_advice,f08bjdg,t3_d45wac,1568478895.0,"ABSOLUTELY PRESS CHARGES! Besides the fact that he was assaulted, it teaches your son that it is ok for him to feel uncomfortable in sexual situations and that he is not a freak because he felt uncomfortable.

Anyone who spews that ""men should enjoy it"" shit should have... it don't even know what.  It makes me so angry. It is why more men dont come forward and and huge part of the shame they feel.

And you are not stupid, you have a bunch of people you to go against your instincts.  It is natural to start to doubt yourself.  What is stupid is that we have allowed that mentally to become so prevalent in our society that we think a CHILD should be ready and thrilled for a sexual experience at any age just because the child is a male."

relationship_advice,eyvfb9h,t3_cyxr38,1567491746.0,"Bare minimum no more family vacation after this one.  In laws totally out of line and ridiculous.  Only you can decide what the right way to react.  Knee jerk reaction is definitely to leave and tell them they are ridiculous.  You know your history and your wife's history with them.  We all have to pick our battles in life and while on the outside looking in this seems like a significant battle, we don't know what the other battles may be.  You may and your wife does.  Picking this battle could mean that your wife sides with you and they back down or it could mean that you lose your wife or your wife loses he family.  I would certainly see it as an issue if your wife NEVER picks ANY battle with her parents or NEVER supports you if you pick a battle.  It can be hard to stand up one's parents and some people are better at it then other's"
relationship_advice,eyveeni,t3_cyrlv5,1567490619.0,"Regarding caregiver resource/supports,  a little tip.  As you Google things, add in the word young.  Example ""young caregivers"".  

My brother learned this when was a caregiver for his wife.  He was frustrated because everything he found was geared toward older people.  People in the 50's+ aren't dealing with the same stressors as people in their 20's and 30's.  College, starting careers, student loans,  buying houses, young kids,  low pay, trying to somehow save money for blown out tires and other emergencies, and so one.  

If you haven't already talk to the social workers were she gets treatment and your local area agency on aging (they work with disabilities as well).  Just go up to both and say, ""all this shit.  Help me"" and they should sit down and help you."
Marriage,eyv88o4,t1_eyv707w,1567483830.0,"Wasn't complaining. I was commenting on how you don't often find two things that are at completely opposite ends of a wide spectrum in one place.  That is interesting to me.  Yes, I do find it annoying when I've just had a fight with my spouse and I get a notification of a happy couple.  I'm not complaining about the sub though.  There is a difference between identifying an emotion on is feeling and complaining about the trigger for the emotion.  

And with what I am asking about I am asking for the perspective of people who have been through it.  I'm not looking for someone to tell me that it is over simply because one person is considering it.  If you are in a happy marriage now and have been through a physical separation, then I would LOVE to hear how/why it helped"
