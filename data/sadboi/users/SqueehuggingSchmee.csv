politics,fcohgn1,t1_fbx7ubp,1577832323.0,"If you are American and go out to eat, you know that it is a cultural norm to tip. Wait staff makes like half the minimum wage ( they call it waitress wage), and they make their money through tips. Having been a waitress, it is a thankless job where you deal with being hit on and lewd comments all day, but you have to smile and take it, bc you need those tips. It is being run ragged, and being blamed if the kitchen is behind, which has nothing to do with you. It is being not only on your feet for eight hours, but hurrying, running around. It is being over-sat (or under-sat) by your hostess. There are either so many tables you are running around like a chicken with her head cut off, or you have 2 tables, and probably won't make past minimum wage, even with tips. It is customer service on over-drive, and it sucks.

The only reason to do it is tip's. On a busy night, you can actually make a decent living, even after tipping out the bus boys and the like. Even when tipping out isn't an official policy, tipping out is restaurant courtesy. You at least throw $20 bux at the bus boys.

YOU know what you signed up for when you eat out, bc you know cultural norms, and you know wait staff is making a half wage without your tip. Until Utopia comes, and ""the tipping culture"" changes bc they decide to actually pay wait staff, yes- the onus IS on you, you cheap bastard. What, is that 5 or 10 dollar tip gonna kill you?

He will ""negotiate"" with her behind closed doors and then come out and say that the Democrats are forcing Republicans to call witnesses. Once these witnesses get on the stand under oath and say publicly what treasonous things Trump has been doing, Republicans will have no choice but to impeach, and can claim that it was all the Democrats fault.

This dispatches with Trump ( in all but a publicity sense, a liability for the Republican party from the get go) but allows Republicans to appear to be on his side, thus retaining the voters in the Cult of Trump.AND it keeps a vindictive, petty psycho off his and the rest of the Republican Senators asses, bc they can appear to remain loyal while still removing him from office.

 if only half of us "" stupid Americans"" voted, and less than half of them support Trump, (making only 20,% of the country actual full on Hate Machine supporters, at the VERY most, and that is assuming NO ONE voted Independent in the whole of the USA), does that JUST PROVE, per your words, that the people who DIDN'T vote at all are ""even MORE STUPID"" than thev40% of VOTERS who supported Trump?

 Mmmmm, I guess that's one interpretation...

I guess that in your mind not voting =Confederate flag waving, blatantly racist, not even a GED among the bunch, white trash garbage piece of s***.

 You seem to assume that most/all non-voters are the same--in demographic, attitude race, culture, and beliefs--as Trump supporters....and THAT is TRULY stupid

 But you know, what I believe bis more likely? (as an actual resident of this country)...? 

 It seems 1000,% more likely that they are Independents that know that the way our 2 party system is set up  their votes count for nothing, so why bother? Or just people exhausted into apathy by a 2 party system where all either party cares about is the corporate concerns, America Inc., when they are concerned about getting some food into their kids stomach, and RIGHT NOW, and not some time after November 2020 (especially after 700,000 of them were removed from eligibility for food stamps). And in our country, there are states that are flourishing, and states that have been decaying for the past thirty years, and each State is as big and as culturally different as to be totally seperate COUNTRIES if we were, say, the EU. 

Except that we are trying to hold it together as ONE SINGLE country. IDK if you understand just how difficult that is. ""You guys"" can't seem to do it, though, even as what seems a very, VERY loose federation....

OR.........

maybe they are just blue collar working people who can't afford to take a Tuesday off to do something that's not going to help them either way, and they know it.

I'm sure as f*** not calling myself a ""PATRIOT"", as you tell me us ""stupid"" Americans insist on doing, even when we are also ""too stupid""  to vote, but  maybe? Maybe? It is STUPID to criticize what you obviously don't even understand...it's almost as if America is an ENORMOUS country with a mind-boggling amount of diversity, culturally, religiously, educationally, religiously, and racially...like the EU, except trying to be ONE country.

Like, if they are trying to be firefighters, they should have to pass the same requirements as a male. Few can,  but SOME can, and only the ones who can hang with the men should be hired. There shouldn't be a less demanding test for the females- pretty obvious, I think.

 I call myself a feminist bc, being a female, of course issues that affect me directly are going to be a top priority for me--that's pretty normal, I think. BUT Men's Rights are equally important.

todayilearned,fag3eji,t1_faeshi8,1576039004.0,"But Latin is a dead language. According to my Magister during my 4 years of Latin, no one really knows for sure exactly how it was originally pronounced--I guess the closest we have to ""knowing"" is how it is spoken in the Catholic Church, as it originated in Rome-which doesn't sound like it has ANY distinct accent to me, and as a raised Catholic girl, I'm pretty used to hearing a priest drone a bit of Latin.

My point is, like the above poster said--exactly what kind of accent do you EXPECT them to use in a movie set in Rome that is not in Latin?...an English accent works as well as anything for ""historical authenticity"" in this case, as Latin seems to be standardly  spoken nowadays with as little discernable accent as possible.

Also, when a movie is made for a certain audience, the accents used are going to tend to be geared towards that audience, simply for ease of understanding. I mean, I'm an American and sometimes I have to use SUBTITLES when watching some things shot in the UK even though they are speaking English.

Also, ""suspension of disbelief"" is kind of a prerequisite for enjoying any film or movie. If the convention in the movie is that the characters are French, but they speak English during the movie and do so with an English accent, you just kind of go with it and move on. I'd rather that than be distracted by a bunch of actors with terrible fake French accents or something. And again, I'm not even that great with understanding heavily accented ENGLISH, and that's my native tongue. Sometimes accents are just a distraction from becoming fully absorbed in the story.

Edit: also someone mentioned that it would be more authentic to have Romans portrayed with Italian accents, but there is NO evidence that that was how actual Romans spoke, or that Latin was accented in that way. In fact, it seems rather unlikely, as accents change quite a bit even over just a few hundred years within the same country, so imagine how COMPLETELY different a Roman's accent of a few thousand years ago would sound vs. an Italian accent of today, even though both cultures inhabit/ed the area where Italy is today."
psychology,f9xhonn,t3_e74n7b,1575711761.0,"The humor ""styles"" listed here are SO simplistic. Self-effacing/tongue in cheek self-deprecating humor is shown to increase people's likeability, but that is not an optional ""style"" here--all humor at one's own expense in this study's world view is self-hating and negative, not a way to admit you are a fallable human, just like your coworker, and integrate it...

They also stress how ""positive"" humor is healthy and makes you likeable, but anyone with a truly stressful job knows that ""negative"" gallows humor is often welcome. It breaks the tension, and voices the negative thoughts that everyone are having, but in a way that helps the negativity dissapate to a bearable level, WHILE increasing feelings of comraderee among the group-since they realize that they are all having dark thoughts and that they aren't alone in their dark internal feelings, or weird bc of their less than socially ideal inner reactions...Simplicity is easy, though-I guess. Even though humor is complex."
