Anxiety,fpqzbwh,t3_geiyn7,1588836971.0,"Yes, this is me with driving I learned how to drive a while ago and now I can’t really do it without having one panic attack. Specially when my bf is in the car and I do something dumb and make out commute harder. He tries to be calm about it because he himself suffers from anger issues but just knowing I’m disappointing him I can’t do it. It’s frustrating coming off as useless"

AsOneAfterInfidelity,flv4lt9,t3_fr8za9,1585516253.0,"I tell him every time I feel the build up inside of me. I rehearse what I am going to say and try to sort my emotions before I say anything to him. Then when I’m lucky the moment feels right and I tell him. but most of the times it becomes to heavy to carry so just pour out into him. 

I tell him exactly how he’s made me feel and I point out the parts I know are my insecurities and the parts I know are things his actions make me feel. 

And then I just hope his love isn’t really as fragile."

turtle,fgyykg1,t1_fgv9i3s,1581188707.0,"Thanks.,”.’m taking it to the vet on Monday. And today I’m buying the tank and stuff. Unfortunately, I live in Chicago, so a pond might not be the best option. Would it be a good idea to put it with other turtles? My neighbor said he’s willing to give me a free tank but he said I have to take a turtle he has too. ??"
