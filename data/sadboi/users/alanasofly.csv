I use them it gets clear for like a couple seconds then back to being blurry... at one point my left eye couldn‚Äôt see as well as my right now. Now I feel like anything that‚Äôs about 15 feet in front of me is not sharp and blurry like! 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being unrealistic but when my expectations were high before I got this since my siblings and my brother in law got it done at the same place just with different doctors! 

Do I give it more time? Last time I checked for my 6 month pre op he said I was seeing good (i don‚Äôt remember what exactly) but I couldn‚Äôt see the smallest line whatever that was.. 

Left eye contacts were: B.C = 8.7. DIA=14.5 PWR=-3.50 CYL -1.25 AX= 010

Right eye contacts were: B.C = 8.7. DIA=14.5 PWR=-3.50 CYL -1.25 AX= 170

CoronavirusUS,fn37xuu,t1_fn37esf,1586615007.0,"No problem! Yes I agree. We really feel lucky that my dad got off the vent but it‚Äôs a long road to recovery. I pray for all those who have lost a loved one and people who are not so ‚Äúlucky‚Äù with this virus. I can‚Äôt even put into words how grateful we are for all the doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals that are on the frontlines risking their lives to protect and heal the ones we love."
CoronavirusUS,fn36j2b,t1_fn18ckb,1586614069.0,That‚Äôs great!! Hope your mom is recovering well.
CoronavirusUS,fn33rwj,t1_fn2jk1c,1586612094.0,Yes he did!
CoronavirusUS,fn26jdh,t1_fn25e75,1586579226.0,You are so kind. Thank you from the bottom of my heart ü•∞ I will keep everyone updated as this goes on!
CoronavirusUS,fn24rvx,t1_fn24lgr,1586577834.0,Omg yes! I remember you. I looked up that couple and the news article. That was tough since they are younger but happy they made it out healthy. Thanks for sending me that again... but thank you! We are happy and still continue to have hope he recovers fully!! ‚ô•Ô∏è
COVID19_support,fn23xmf,t1_fn23stw,1586577192.0,Ain‚Äôt it the best? üòíüôÑüôÉ
COVID19positive,fn22adw,t1_fn21sw4,1586575965.0,Thank you! This is what I love about reddit. I love to hear about the outcomes of peoples stories. Feels like you are going through the fight or if it‚Äôs a good story the adventure with them! Lol thank you!
COVID19_support,fn227e6,t1_fn220vx,1586575905.0,Damn I meant It‚Äôs in a new post on a different sub Reddit. CoronavirusUS... sorry when I first posted his story I was eager and anxious to see how many people I could reach out to that was going through the same situation. I was desperate at that point just to find first hand accounts! I have really bad anxiety and OCD so it helped me to talk to as many people as possible and reassure myself!
COVID19_support,fn220vx,t1_fn21mny,1586575773.0,Oh also I just added the links in the post so it would be easier for people to find!
COVID19_support,fn21z4b,t1_fn21mny,1586575737.0,Yeah it was pretty surreal haha shits crazy and REAL!  Never in a million years did I think it would hit someone I know let alone BOTH my parents. It‚Äôs still surreal. I‚Äôm just happy he is alive and continues to fight this!
COVID19_support,fn2156w,t1_fn203dg,1586575125.0,"Thank you! My dad is a janitor in a township municipal building. We think he got it from there considering he only went to work and home. My mom had a bad sinus infection prior and was on antibiotics... she finally started to feel better and 2 days later after my dad was experiencing symptoms she showed new symptoms that were high fever, throw up, diarrhea, loss of appetite. It was really scary she was like a different person. She tried to stick it out at home like a champ. She‚Äôs a nurse. They tend to have that mentality (which is a good thing when it comes to nursing) not when your sick as a dog. She checked her pulse and O2 levels and they were super low in the early 80s... so she called 911 and an ambulance took her to the hospital! The same day my dad got intubated. To say it was a shitty day would be an understatement. She was there for 5 days with only the nostril oxygen thingy! You can read more in my submissions on my profile if you have any more questions :) thank you!!"
COVID19positive,fn1zncx,t1_fn1yoj6,1586574042.0,Aw thank you so much for showing such compassion. Your a good person. ‚ô•Ô∏èüôèüèª prayers for all the healthcare workers and everyone else on the frontlines during this crisis!
CoronavirusUS,fn1xvme,t1_fn1xlj3,1586572767.0,We can only hope for the best outcome! I appreciate the kind words ‚ô•Ô∏è
CoronavirusUS,fn1x5yv,t1_fn1x1os,1586572260.0,Ooo I will have to get him some!! Thank you!
CoronavirusUS,fn1wwz4,t1_fn1w3lc,1586572085.0,I‚Äôm so happy it gave you some hope and comfort! This is why I wanted to share my dads story. Since prior to Reddit there was barely any articles on the internet showing positive things and the people who are surviving and getting off the vents. Especially ‚Äúolder‚Äù‚Äôpeople. I‚Äôll pray for your aunt and family!! üôèüèª‚ô•Ô∏è continue to stay strong for her!
CoronavirusUS,fn1wkj6,t1_fn1vxs0,1586571841.0,Haha that would be amazing!
CoronavirusUS,fn1rtbc,t1_fn1rdlf,1586568623.0,I don‚Äôt think so. The doctors said he was literally their ‚Äústar‚Äù patient. Whatever that means. He remained stable the entire time. They didn‚Äôt have to prone him (alternating turning him over to get better oxygen flow like a lot of the other patients need). And he wasn‚Äôt on the highest level of oxygen. So I‚Äôm not really sure :/ sorry!
COVID19positive,fn1ng9l,t1_fn1n89a,1586565799.0,I‚Äôm not sure I have the answer to your question :( if I find it somewhere or hear about it I‚Äôll get back to you!
CoronavirusUS,fn1ne9o,t1_fn1n45q,1586565764.0,Nope :)
COVID19positive,fn1ncyt,t1_fn1n29o,1586565742.0,We are lucky to have him and I am lucky to have him as my dad ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
COVID19positive,fn1n9ho,t1_fn1mji0,1586565678.0,Thank you so much ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
COVID19positive,fn1lqsc,t1_fn1lnlr,1586564717.0,Yes... I saw that but let‚Äôs hope it improves day by day! Thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
CoronavirusUS,fn1lpa5,t1_fn1lg5z,1586564691.0,Aw man I‚Äôm so sorry about your dad! That‚Äôs terrible! But he seems so strong especially to have been intubated not once but twice! I can‚Äôt imagine. Your comment was very interesting to read! I didn‚Äôt know the recovery went for how many days you were in that equals one week of recovery. Crazy! I hope your dad is still doing well. I imagine it being hard for him to recover after 2x and it‚Äôs hard for him to continue. You just gotta make your always there and cheering him on! Take care!!
