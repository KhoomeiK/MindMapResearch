In my opinion, it does also depend on the course, depends on whether you have prior knowledge in something or not and also on your goals. I am studying Software Engineering and learning things that are quite new to me. For me, it's not so easy to manage 4 units because I really want to be able to do other things as well. Like, not only just focusing on my studies but also work on other things.  I have been interested in game development and mobile development for instance. I was planning to incorporate some time during the semester and honestly thought it would be manageable but I simply just don't have the time to set for those things. Not only these things, there are other interests I want to pursue but there is just no time if I am trying to get the best possible marks across all my 4 units. Also, I would like to work too while studying.

If I want to do all those things, I just can't do it with 4 units. Not sure if someone can relate to me.

Good on you for being able to manage 4 units and it's great that it helps you to manage time better."

Exactly, I think I can totally agree, I haven't taken up one unit before but I do understand when you say that you actually ""LEARN"" and hence really understand what your coursework is about, which can help to even make you more curious to learn.

Yeah, 4 units is too much for me as well, I am trying my best but it's very hard because there is literally no time for anything else, like working for instance.

And great job on your 90%, keep it up!"
Monash,fqzsyyw,t3_glsbwa,1589774652.0,"Have never earned a mark in the 90-95% range but I am just curious to know those people who did earn a mark in the 90-95% range(well done btw!), did you guys do 4 units? Did you guys do any overloading? Basically, how many units per semester did you guys had to study for. Because that's also a factor to consider. Because the more units you have to study for, I am guessing the harder it is to do well in each of those units.

Only asking because I have always been doing 4 and I am deciding to do 3 next semester or even less just so I can really dive deep into the coursework and actually learn rather than feel like completing tasks just for the sake of completing tasks on time."

It's really easy through social media and I would do the same as well. I would rather seek help from online than actually seeking help from the real world because I get it's just more comfortable that way. But then, the problem is, it doesn't help. You really need someone beside you.

You know what may help you? I have watched YoutTube videos where people talk to each other through VR and I feel like that really helps a lot cos you are in a virtual world with actual people who might be willing to hear you out.

Like this one:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lW3REL3-s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6lW3REL3-s)

I kept on asking him how he is and well he never replied one day, he deleted his account. I can only guess the worst had happened.

From what you have said, yeah, I now understand how you guys feel. I don't know how to help you guys but I honestly never had ill intentions trying to help him out, I just went with my own instincts.

But now I am curious, what sort of thing do you guys want to hear? If you don't want to hear about ""do some hobbies"", what do you really want to hear? Because you do say you want help but I honestly don't know how and I was wondering what you are expecting in terms of help?"

And now time has passed, looking back, well, I didn't know the person that well but there is this feeling of ""this person didn't deserve to die"" and if you don't think about it, you just kind of forget the person even existed. That's my experience.

However, to those people who are wealthy, well they don't need to worry about it at all, either they inherited wealth or they just worked really hard to get what they wanted, like, for instance Elon Musk who obviously worked hard to be financially wealthy.

And so, I guess people like Elon does show a little hope but if it was easy, then everyone would be like Musk. It just takes pure hard work, determination, insane grit and will to achieve things and Musk has done that. The issue is not everyone has these die hard qualities like Musk does. I bet he took certain risks to get where he is today and you have to ask the question; ""would anyone else have taken the same risks as Musk""? Well maybe, but definitely not the majority, only the minority and hence why the majority just feels crap for having to go to work simply to survive. 

But obviously, there are people who like their jobs, so, to them, it's not a sacrifice. 

I guess what we can learn from here is...you either do the job you love, or you put everything you have got to build a business or you do some job just for means of survival and if these are not the options for you, then, well, we tend to hate our lives. The hard thing is doing something about it because we are so scared to take risks and so scared to try things out."
Monash,fplzlft,t3_ge63bw,1588722551.0,"The fact that you said ""don't need to decide my major right out of that bat"" is a good reason as to why attending Monash is a good idea. This is because everyone has to do a common year which is in their first year. If you really don't know what to major in, it's pretty good to do the first year if you are really willing to find out about other majors and if you really want to learn the basics of chemical, civil, electrical, materials, software, mechanical and so on. Yes, you will learn fundamentals from each of those fields I mentioned and that's the question you have to ask. Do you really want to do a common year or would you start on a particular major? For instance, if you fall in love with electrical straight away in semester 1, you can't just ignore all the other core units you need to complete every other core unit such as chemical and civil. You must at least pass them. So, that's kind of the downside to the degree at Monash because to some, the common year may be a waste of time. Like for me, it kind of was, I never wanted to learn chemical, electrical and mechanical but I had to and I would have rather spent my time on  the things I liked.

I am not sure about UNSW, USYD and ANU but I do know RMIT has engineering degrees where you can go straight into a particular major without doing a common year and this suits many people who really know what they want to do.

I would say pick Monash if you are really willing to learn other engineering fields and if you really have no clue what you want to major in; thus, the first common year giving you an opportunity to find out which field you might be interested in.

And also, like others have said, Monash has great facilities and student support is pretty good, so you may want to take those into consideration as well. However, it all really depends on what your goals are and what you hope to get out of the degree. 

Best of luck."

study,fp5asp9,t3_gbatvq,1588322412.0,"When learning to code, you must practice coding. You need to start coding. It is definitely alright to note take. For example, at the moment, I am learning about ""Exceptions"" and ""Assertions"". I read the lecturer's notes and I take notes. However, this is not enough. You will be able to retain information by taking notes but without coding, you will not be able to apply the new knowledge you learned after note taking. 

So, after learning a concept such as about ""For loops"", test it out. And when you are testing them out, debug your program. Debugging your program will help you to learn how the computer executes logic and how the computer runs your code. By debugging, you will learn the flow of execution and will eventually allow you to think more like a computer. 

tl;dr: After taking notes, apply your new knowledge by coding. Test everything. See what works and see what fails. Test all the possible things you could think of and try to find odd results. And debug your program to learn the control flow. If you can do all these, you will get better in understanding code."

Honestly the things you have to say are pretty intelligent. I don't care whatever disorder you have, you are a someone to me. I just think you are being too hard on yourself. 

I honestly think it's to do the way you see yourself. I tend to be too hard on myself and I can see that sometimes. When I am being compared to people I know, it hurts me because I haven't achieved anything compared to the people I know. I sometimes verbally and physically abuse myself, punishing myself for not being ""good enough"". And then all of a sudden, I realize what I am doing is wrong and just plain immature. I just let the emotions get  the better of me rather than logically thinking what I should do to better myself. 

So, right now, I am trying to be logical in my thoughts. Honestly saying, it's hard to do this but it does work if I do try it. For instance, if I tell myself ""okay, it's ok, try again, you just have to look for another solution and if you can't get it, ask someone and that's how I will learn"", I will get motivated again and be able to focus again.

So, maybe you should try something similar. I hope you have been inspired by the other great looking responses.

study,fn9m7pv,t3_g0ec8p,1586778166.0,"To be honest with you and I am saying this with my experience, the quickest way to learn a language is to be immersed in the language. So, that's if you are in the country of that language you want to speak in. Or, another way to be immersed in the language is to constantly be reading, listening and writing in that language. Try to just use the language you want to learn whenever possible. Avoid speaking in your own mother tongue, try to speak little sentences with the language you want to speak in.

I didn't know English at all when I came to an English speaking country. But I went to school here and in about a month I was able to speak fluently with a bit of grammar mistakes and with very limited vocab. However, after about 6 months, I definitely picked up on my grammar and vocab was improved too. And about a year later, I was just like any other English speaking student, it was just my accent that was different. So, honestly saying, it really is possible to learn the very basics of the language in a month and definitely possible to be fluent after 6 months have passed. And I was able to do so because I was immersed in the language. Every single day, I am at school, so, the only language I hear is English. Obviously my parents spoke in their mother tongue but that was only at home. So, there you go, they key is to be immersed in the language. Use the language for everything and that is for listening, reading, writing and speaking.

Try to read some online text in a language, try to read the news manuscript in that language, listen to news/tv shows/cartoons/movies in that language, write something in that language and speak in that language(which is the hard one but you could always speak to yourself if you don't know someone who speaks the language you want to learn). If you can do this everyday, you will for sure learn it quickly. But, as you can see, it requires a lot of work and you want to learn three languages which is quite demanding.

I honestly don't know the answer to whether it's possible or not because it all depends on the time. If you have time, yes, it is possible but again this depends on the time. Also, depends on how much effort you are willing to put.

Anyway, the key is, be immersed with the language as much as possible."
learnmath,fmzerq3,t1_fmyvfcf,1586517840.0,"It fascinates you? You are in the right track then. And you know another reason for why you are in the right track? Because you ""really wanna improve"" and that goes far. As long as you have that desire to just get better and better, you will do well in your subjects and head into Engineering.

But, you must also accept challenging times and learn from them. This has been my biggest weakness and I am slowly getting better at it. When I was in my first year, I used to be so hard on myself for not understanding something or for not being able to answer something. I used to get so angry at myself and I would just give up. No, that's not the way to go. If you get stuck on something, it's not your fault. If you get stuck on something, it's not because you are stupid. If you get stuck on something, be proactive about it, go ask questions, look for answers and eventually you will solve the problem! Yes, it takes time but is it a waste of time? No, it's worth the time because at the end of the day, you just got smarter by doing so. So, my advice is, you must be patient when you are learning, don't expect for instant results.

So, invest yourself in the learning process and you are exactly right. No one is stopping you but there is only person who can and that's you. If you are facing hard times, just remember what I said, it's all part of the learning process and remind yourself why you are learning.

And, since its early days for you and since you are interested in Engineering, research about the different disciplines/fields in Engineering and see what interests you. Since you are interested in ""building stuff and using computer programs to build 3D models"", maybe you might be interested in Mechatronic Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, even Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering or Software Engineering. There are so many fields but take your time. Understand each field clearly and choose the one that makes you salivate with passion. When I say passion, do something that will make you be excited about, that will make you go ""oh, this is great"".

Yeah, no problem, I just want to help an aspiring Engineer. I just don't want you to make the same mistakes I did. Trust me, you will get there as long as you keep your head high even in the toughest of moments. And before you go to Uni, try to be clear in the major you want to do. The best way to learn about the majors is to contact the University or attend an Open day. I am not sure where you are from but in Australia, there are Uni events called Open days where anyone can come to Uni to learn about the different careers you can get into. I say ""try"" to have a major in your head but it's ok not to be certain. It's ok if you are not because you can always change in Uni too.

In year 10, I just became really interested in math and ever since then, I have always been interested in it. I studied Engineering mathematics and advanced engineering mathematics at uni and they were very interesting to learn even though sometimes it was challenging! However, my interest in math kept me wanting to learn and understand.

Oh, and it's a lot of practice,practice, practice and more practice by the way.

I have never used Khan academy but I am guessing it's a good resource and it seems like you can work your way up like that.

So, without listening to lectures at Uni, by relying only on the resource above, by attempting all the questions from the problem sets, with YouTube as well and due to having a great support class teacher, I managed a D for the unit.

But, I realized that she too started being more caring towards me, she started to get less annoyed and appreciated for the person I am because I help her around the house. I help her whenever she needs it. And if you read my post, you will see that I tell OP to help the mother around the house and she will appreciate that. And this is just one thing I said. All the things I have I said to OP are from my experiences. So, I do understand the situation.

There are some mothers out there who still keeps their bad habits even if their child is quite mature. There are strict mothers out there who are also fed up with their own lives and sometimes, they just need someone to help them out. It means a lot to them.

I just want the OP to know that it was completely fine for him/her to have reacted that way because I feel like I would have done the same when I was at that age. Actually, I do remember trying to hit my mother when I was younger but failing terribly because I was pretty weak back then. I just want OP to know that the relationship with his/her mother can get better if OP can just be a little patient with his/her mother, try to listen to her, help her around the house, try to maintain a positive relationship and it will get better. If you read my post, that's what I am basically saying. And I have a healthy relationship with my mother now.

I can now see that people obviously downvoted me probably because they had much worse experiences with their mother than I did. Probably, I don't know. Again, my original post is from the experiences I had. You clearly had a different experience. If you don't mind me asking, how is your relationship with your mother?"

wholesomememes,fl0eol5,t1_fl0dnih,1584703792.0,"Right I see. I understand what you are saying. And yeah, lots of languages are written with the same letters and they don't make sense to the people who haven't learned the language. So, just as how we can learn a language, do you think there will be ever a time when computer systems might do that? 

Would you say that ""if"" there was some advanced tech that allowed the CPU to talk with the other hardware devices without needing drivers, that the computer system would be more faster in regards to execution of a particular instruction? Would the computer system be more efficient?

I understand the mouse and the CPU are different when it comes to their functions. I am learning MIPS assembly language at the moment (I am not sure if you are familiar with it or not) but when you said that the two are different, I just remembered how there are MIPS instructions such as ""add $t0, $t1, $t3"" and each of these terms here: ""add"", ""$t0"", ""$t1"" and ""$t3"" have different number of bits encoding each term. So, the ""operation code"" which is ""add"" in this case is encoded by 6 bits whereas the ""destination register"" which is ""$t0"" in this case is encoded by 5 bits. So we have different numbers of bits for each term(for lack of a better word) and I just thought maybe the different functions in a mouse for instance can be connected to the CPU with something like an assembler instruction as I mentioned above and each of these functions can be encoded in different number of bits. So, I just thought maybe this can help for CPU to communicate with everything?

I am sorry if it does sound dumb, I just started my SE studies this year."

wholesomememes,fl0brtl,t1_fl0bg0x,1584700452.0,"Right, I see. So, basically would you say that drivers are like neurons(sends electrical signals to our brain to do stuff(move, kick) and the CPU is like the brains. So, the CPU can only talk with other hardware devices as long as the driver sends a message to the CPU? If that's the case, damn, that's interesting. I honestly thought the CPU does everything and understands everything but then I realized it's just like a brain because the brain only sends messages whenever there is a stimulus and in this case the driver sends the stimulus. damn

I might be wrong though, it's just my interpretation."

Anger,fk5r1fw,t3_fgmhcm,1583886199.0,"When you started to cry, what was your mother's reaction? She might not have come up to you and comforted you but deep down, she feels guilty too. Trust me, your mother loves you from the bottom of her heart.  My father hides his emotions and pretends to not care but my mother is the opposite. And hence I don't have a strong bond with my father but I do with my mother as she demonstrates her care towards me. I wish my father did too. I know my father works hard but I tend to engage in fights with him; however, I have told myself not to because it's pointless as it only worsens the relationship. It's definitely hard not to argue but I sometimes feel sorry for him and I feel guilty too for verbally fighting with him.

Your mother seems to be in an angry mood due to her long working hours and hence she is stressed most of the time as you have mentioned. Thus, she cannot control it and she loses her stress on you which is unfortunate. Well, what you can do is, try to help her out with the house, wash the dishes before your mother returns home, broom the house before she returns home, do anything which will reduce her stress at home. For instance, I broom the house, wash the dishes, tidy the dishes before she returns home from work, I help her out whenever she requires help and she seems to appreciate my support.

And when your mother does pose a question, try to not talk back, try to calmly answer the question and try to respond in a neutral tone. It's hard when your mother's questions may annoy you. My father asks me questions that annoy me, even my mother but I try to answer them in a neutral tone, in a tone that doesn't sound like I am trying to argue and it is really worth it. Starting an argument is the worst, your whole day can be ruined sometimes.

And your relationship with your mother will not be better in a day by the way, take your time, you just have to be the more understanding, the more mature person and avoid fights at all costs. Trust me, she will start treating you better as well and you will form a more healthier relationship with your mother.

Basically what I am trying to say is, show that you respect and care about her. Oh, and don't forget, she does care about you, she does respect you, she does love you but she may physically not show them. She might even start showing that she cares about you as your relationship with your mother improves.

Oh, it's completely alright for you to feel bad/guilty and sad. It shows you care about your mother and you simply just had a bad day with her. Just take it day by day from now on and be the best person you can be each day.

Best of wishes.

ITCareerQuestions,fjjxy6y,t1_fjjsslc,1583415354.0,"I understand you as a person. I know people who blatantly speaks their mind and says whatever he/she believes in; **however,** those people don't mean to be rude at all, those people are not trying to intentionally offend anyone.

This might be difficult for you but it's something you must practice. When you are going to give an answer, don't just blurt whatever is in your head, think about what you are going to say and think whether your thoughts will hurt someone's feelings.

For instance, you are ""turkophob"" but would you say that to someone who is Turkish? Obviously not I hope. And why would you not say that you are turkophob to a Turkish person? Because it will hurt that person's feelings.

And this applies to everything when you are talking to someone, just take the time to think about whether you are thoughts are going to be hurtful or not. In general, just have common sense.

Now, I am saying this as a joke because I want to try and make you feel. I don't know where you are from but if I said that I hate where you come from, how you guys should not exist, how you should all rot and die, how would you feel? I am hoping you feel a little shocked by that and upset. Exactly, think about how others would feel and don't say anything that will provoke anyone's emotions(unless of course it's your intention to make someone angry). And just to remind you, what I said was an example/joke to give you an idea of how to respond without being rude.

I wouldn't say you need therapy, it's just how you were raised and what you were taught during your childhood but you definitely need to seek guidance if you are still unsure about the way you communicate with people. I hope you improve.

ProgrammingBuddies,fiwxqmg,t3_fa9pcg,1582807023.0,"Pick from either Python, C++/C#/C or Java. I have suggested these languages because firstly, Python is beginner friendly and is a fun language to learn. 

Secondly, languages such as C++/C#/C and Java are object oriented which is a programming concept you will eventually have to learn when you are learning Python as well. 

However, if you are willing to study hard, be disciplined, ask questions; then, my best advice is you start on an object oriented language first because learning a such language will help you to understand what programming is all about and appreciate programming. You will be able to improve your thinking, be a better programmer by learning a object oriented language.

I say to start with an object oriented language because Python makes writing algorithms/writing code/programming easy to implement but if you truly want to know how to implement a solution with minimum support from the language; thus, making you a better programmer, then don't start with Python. 

Remember, a programming language is a tool to help you solve problems. Some tools help you solve problems better and more easily such as Python but since you are a beginner, it is important you learn/understand programming fundamentals/concepts at a deep level; hence why I recommend you start with an object oriented language. 

Once you have learned a majority of the programming fundamentals with an OO language, then learn Python. You will soon realize how programmer friendly Python is and you will see how fun it is to code in Python."

I learned C++ using an IDE, have been learning Python using an IDE and currently learning Java using an IDE. I had no problem understanding any concepts and had no problems  debugging too. Using an IDE helped me to understand the debugging process more clearly and definitely improved my debugging skills. Also, debugging using an IDE significantly helped me to understand programming logic a lot more easily; thus, really helped me to think more like a computer as I was able to see what was happening at every line of the debugging process. Honestly saying, I am glad I started with an IDE because it personally helped me.

Right, I didn't know there will be times when you don't use an IDE. So, I am just curious, what kinds of positions require a person to not use an IDE and are those positions popular in the IT industry? And what do you mean by ""machines you don't control over""?

Also, you mentioned above ""remote servers without GUI interfaces"". Does this mean that when debugging, one is unable to see the value a variable might have? Or is it more complex than that?

So, are there enterprises you know out there that don't use IDE's? I am just wondering, by not using an IDE in a professional setting, wouldn't this be highly inefficient when it comes to debugging? Wouldn't the debugging process be slow?

I am a Software Engineering student by the way, starting my major this year, so if my questions sound odd, please excuse me.

Anger,fijbmzi,t3_f85w5r,1582441029.0,"Well, I imagined myself seeing someone angry in public and this depends on the level of anger the person is expressing. 

If say the person is expressing a low level of anger, such as by displaying angry facial expressions and if I were to see that, I would like to back away.

If say the person is expressing mild level of anger, such as by displaying angry facial expressions but has now started to argue with someone or possibly started to curse and if I were to see that, I would like to back away. 

If say the person is expressing high levels of anger, such as by displaying angry facial expressions, who is arguing/cursing but has now started to smash his mobile phone for instance or started to wreck everything in his way and if I were to see that, I would like to back away. 

In all the scenarios, I would like to back away simply because I just don't want to get hurt and I want to protect myself. 

However, to others, it can be quite scary and can cause someone to have panic attacks if that someone has some sort of a disorder or PTSD of some sort.

Now, the way I described the levels of anger are very subjective, these only apply to me. Someone else might think a low level of anger is when someone is cursing. So, it depends on the person. 

But, regardless of the level of anger, in general, to see such a hateful expression like anger is simply disturbing, ugly and that can ruin someone's day as well. But again, someone else might see it as funny and maybe try to provoke the angered person causing even more trouble. There, that's also another reason, seeing someone angry can even lead to more of a chaotic situation. So, for all those reasons, I see it as a taboo to get angry in **public.** It's definitely alright to express anger but demonstrate it when you are alone or if you are with a psychologist or if you are with someone you know who understands your emotions. 

Being angry in public is pointless because most likely the person will be reported by a civilian to protect his/her own safety. 

Anyway, I hope you understand what I am trying to say."
learnprogramming,fiivv5v,t1_fii8n80,1582428192.0,"Yeah, agree. In my opinion as well, it's best for beginners to use an IDE because Universities use IDE's and in one's professional career, companies will be using IDE's. Hence, it's important to familiarize yourself with IDE's."
SoftwareEngineering,fiir5t4,t3_f80703,1582425018.0,"Don't rely on University to teach you the fundamentals of programming in a easy, slow pace manner because most of the time, University expects students to keep up with the fast pace nature of learning. University is fast paced and the students who have prior programming experience(who are self taught/have been programming as a hobby) will easily understand concepts/topics and will tend to do well in Uni. There are also students who have no prior programming experience and it becomes harder for those students to keep up with the University. The lecturers will never wait for those people who are not able to keep up because the lecturer's job is to simply teach the content and answer student's questions. It is completely up to those students to work harder than the rest if those students are willing to keep up with the fast pace of Uni.

Obviously, there are students who don't have prior programming experience, yet they perform very well because they are very interested in the field; hence, are always invested in learning and improving their skills. And that is who you need to become since you don't have prior programming experience.

And you have started well. You are learning Python and at the moment, any language is appropriate because it is important you familiarize yourself with programming fundamentals. This is because once you understand the basic programming concepts, it becomes easier to learn other languages.

I am studying Software Engineering and will be starting my major this year and I have been preparing by learning Python and Java because these two languages will be required for most of my classes. So, try to find out the programming languages your classes will be using and learn them.

I recommend you continue to learn Python. Then while you are learning Python, if you can, try and also learn ""Discrete Mathematics"".  Also try to learn about ""Data structures and Algorithms"". After that try learning a more lower level language such as C++/C#/C or Java because learning a such language will allow you to appreciate what programming is all about and it will allow you to learn more complex concepts in programming.

So, then, start thinking about a project you may want to start on. For instance, after I have learned the basics of Java, I am going to try and learn Android development and I intend to make an app as part of my own project. This will really help to improve your coding skills and also learn about software design and gain insight into professional code. You might be interested in web development or desktop development, it is completely up to you.

Oh, and the awesome benefit of learning Software Engineering is that almost anything can be learned by self teaching yourself. There are tons of resources online and one can learn to become a Software Engineer by not even attending University. There are Boot Camps but no such Boot Camps for say students studying Civil Engineering. And Software Engineering is a very cool major because there are so many amazing DIY projects one can be involved in and it's very diverse. So, you are right, that's also the main reason why I chose Software Engineering. I was initially going to choose Civil. Anyway, welcome to SE and hopefully you will enjoy the learning. 

Well, I wish you the best of luck and happy studying!"

Procrastination is the hardest, at least for me.

Well, critical thinking skills can also be gained without college as through studying, through searching for different solutions, by practicing different solutions can help to develop one's critical thinking skills. Even discipline can actually be learned without college. In my opinion, people who don't attend college and people who are self taught have to put in more effort to find resources, to look for solutions and to learn; thus, demonstrating a great deal of discipline.

I believe teamwork is the main skill Universities teach due to providing many group work assignments and projects. People who don't attend college have a hard time gaining the group work experience. Honestly though, even then, a self learning student can also gain teamwork skills by forming a small group of people alike and dividing certain tasks into smaller tasks, then discussing/sharing solutions to problems.

So, we can see that all kinds of skills are achievable regardless of whether one is attending University or not; however, I feel University is a platform that makes it easier to develop those skills but it is all up to the University student whether he/she is willing to accept the benefits of University or not.

So, for instance, when you felt like throwing your bag, just run out of the class without saying anything or if you can hold it, tell the teacher that you are going to the toilet/outside(But if the teacher refuses you to go), well, just run out. Anyway, you run out and maybe trying running as hard as you can until you tire yourself? I feel like this will significantly reduce the anger levels. So, when your anger has dropped, come back to class. But obviously, try not to stay out of class for too long. Maybe like 5 minutes tops. And if you do get in trouble for going out, talk to the teacher about it but if he/she doesn't listen to you, talk to someone of higher authority, like the Principle/Vice Principle? I don't know, I am just trying to think of an idea.

Oh and me too, I get heated up at home sometimes but whenever I feel like I am going to be boiled into a very hard egg, I tell myself ""it's not worth it"" and I immediately go away from that and do something that distracts me. Oh, and do slow breathing. Like, inhale and exhale.

Maybe you could also try yoga? I have heard yoga helps to calm down and not express anger. I am thinking of trying that.

&#x200B;

Oh and anytime by the way, if you need anyone to talk to/ask questions, feel free to do so."
learnprogramming,fi6e335,t1_fi3qi1w,1582190344.0,"Oh, forgot to say something else. If you have decided on a book, stick to it! So, if you have decided to say learn C++ using a particular book, use it until you have finished the book. 

Because there are tons of resource available but if you don't stick to one, then you won't be learning because most of the time you will be doubting and trying to find that ""best"" book. 

However, do use other resources, read from other books too but have one particular book as your main learning material."

And, the fact you are working out regularly is a good idea, I am guessing it helps to calm you down, alleviate some stress and gain some positive energy. 

May you recover soon."

learnprogramming,fi54lg6,t1_fi3qi1w,1582154805.0,"Hmm, interesting. I am guessing it all depends on the learner. I read a review where one complains how it is ""not a beginner friendly book for starting C++"". 

C++ was my first language and I was learning C++ through this book and in my honest opinion, it was beginner friendly. However, I didn't also solely rely on the book. Whenever I didn't understand the book, I tried Youtube, asked questions, read explanations from other websites and this is how I learned. Along with the research I did, reading this book definitely did help me to understand the fundamentals of C++. 

But, I only learned up to Chapter 6 and up to this chapter, I found it to be very helpful. 

Despite it being helpful, well, you might be correct. I am not too sure but having read reviews, I found two people saying that some areas are outdated. But the rest are all positive about the book and how it is appropriate for beginners. 

Honestly saying, it is up to you. I recommend searching for different C++ books and look at their reviews. Then decide on the book you are going to use based on the number of positive reviews."
AskReddit,fi3aecg,t3_f611xp,1582108926.0,"The movie ""Calibre"" anyone? Recently watched it. Don't watch the trailer because apparently it reveals too much. I didn't watch the trailer.

Anyway, there is a huge twist in it and the twist is revealed quite early in the movie and that is exactly what shocked me and kept me intrigued. At every moment, I wanted to know what would happen next.

Definitely recommend watching ""Calibre""."

learnprogramming,fhkcly0,t1_fhkbdp9,1581677915.0,"Thanks!

It shows that I have to pay? I thought OP said it was going to be free? 

No, I am not saying that having to pay is a bad idea, it's just that, with all due respect to OP, I am a simple guy and I just want to try an app out without having to pay. 

I am sure it's a great game, I just don't want to waste on it. Because I am someone who normally try a game and deletes it like within 2 days and honestly I don't download a lot of apps either. 

But, that's completely up to OP's choice, I just feel he is limiting the number of downloads by not making it free. 

Anyway, kudos to OP."

Yeah, it's funny, when I see a mechanic just holding a wrench, I am like ""how in the hell do you fix cars with that"". Geez, so naive. Had no idea a wrench was capable of so much. I have mad respect for wrenches now."

Sorry if it sounds like a stupid question, it's just that I feel a bit nervous trying to do it on my own because I don't want to obviously accidentally break something. Are you sure I don't need to have any kind of training to be able to do these tasks? Or, can anyone do it just by watching vids? That's why I was hesitant to try it on my own car. 

But I understand what you are saying. I guess I have to be super careful and do everything perfectly and cautiously."

Yeah, the wikipedia does look pretty good. Thanks for the links.

Like, I just learned about catalytic converters today very briefly from a Youtube video and I didn't even know cars needed that. Also, I didn't even know cars needed mufflers as there are apparently regulations in regards to how much noise a car can make. 

Hmm, I see, kind of sucks I guess. 

""even electronic control of the throttle via drive by wire, so your gas pedal essentially acts like an Xbox game controller trigger and inputs only exactly what the computer says it can based on your input, but not actually connected directly to your input anymore"". LOL, that sucks.

Yeah, in regards to racing, I think I prefer a road course, nothing too complex, just was thinking to start small for beginners and then go on to more complex routes after I have gained experience.

Yeah, thanks for mentioning about ""MightyCarMods"". Yeah, exactly, it is a bit hard I reckon in Australia. But honestly for now, my main focus is just learning everything about how a car works.

Thanks again"
