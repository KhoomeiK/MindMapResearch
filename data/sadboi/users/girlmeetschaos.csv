learnart,fml59se,t3_fvujsz,1586178945.0,I would try slightly longer strokes for the hair as opposed to just hatching. Or directional hatching. It's coming along SUPER nice 👌
getdisciplined,fml50iu,t3_fvqhu8,1586178759.0,Baby steps. Small goals. Start small and a little bit every day. You'll get it! :) It just takes a bit of time.

ArtistLounge,fm1l5ou,t1_flvft13,1585680416.0,Oh! Then in that case you could totally pull it off with like.. a nice little aesthetic set up! :)
ArtistLounge,flvdr0i,t3_frem0j,1585521679.0,"Unless you’re incredibly talented I would definitely work on making it more of a priority and working at it more often. Art is a very difficult discipline and it takes a lot of dedication and hard work. You’re still young so it’s not the end of the world if you don’t do that now, but you may end up regretting it later on when your peers are much more advanced because they’ve been obsessively practicing their whole lives (at least that was my experience, lol). 
I started fairly late and definitely wish I’d started taking art more seriously at a younger age but at the same time I wasn’t ready for that kind of responsibility yet. Take your time and do things at your own pace, just be aware of the road ahead. 
Best of luck! :)"
ArtistLounge,flvctfh,t3_frep6c,1585521120.0,"I’ve always been told by my instructors that you should be scanning because at the end of the day you can tell when a picture was taken. If you so much as have the wrong angle or bad lighting it can totally ruin your piece. 

Some people do it with professional cameras though, especially for bigger pieces or things that genuinely can’t be scanned. 

I’m not saying you can’t use your phone.. But especially for a portfolio I wouldn’t do that. I’d go get it scanned by someone else if need be. You want your work to look its best! 
:) best of luck!!"

As long as you keep improving, even if it's slow improvement, you're doing great. And if you're not improving, just keep having fun and it will come. Opportunities will fall into your hands as you follow your passion, you'll see. 

Keep your chin up! You got this! Being an artist is harsh on one's self esteem I find, lol, but you got this!"
COPYRIGHT,flqh7ag,t1_fl3wtqd,1585394654.0,Thank you so much for this information! Do you know how I can go about finding this out? At this point it's more out of curiosity since this would just be a small personal project but I also feel it has a lot of potential to be something fun and cute! Anne was a phenomenal writer.

ambien,fl3v01c,t1_fl3udra,1584799042.0,Yeah I thought it was a one time thing but it keeps happening. I think I maybe get a productive mindset to the point where I start to feel overwhelmed maybe? Cause I’m sleepy from the ambien but feeling creative from the weed? I don’t know. It is wild!!!! I’m not sure what kind of weed it is though. I think it’s hybrid? It’s not the kind that makes you sleepy lol which in retrospect.. duh..
ArtistLounge,fl1fpsh,t3_flu3fj,1584728089.0,I've never touched oil paints until this week. They've always felt daunting to me and I was scared of just making a mess cause I know it dries super slow.. But holy!!! I love them :)

In such a case where you’re deliberately denying God just to accept him later.. Would forgiveness still be given?"

sheridan,fje624r,t3_ev6e4o,1583265932.0,I’m applying for art fundamentals but I’ve done a course in animation and know a few things about putting together a portfolio. PM me if you’d like some critiques :)
sheridan,fje5n2r,t3_f48ae9,1583265701.0,In the animation field you’d never make it or even really be able to get/hold a job like that so I was going to say it’ll come back to bite them in the ass but... I guess it depends on the program. I hope it does. Definitely do your studying because it’s worth it and you are paying for it. But yeah I’d be real pissed too.

TrueChristian,fgtcvu5,t3_f0bg9t,1581102769.0,You're so right. It's easy to overlook your blessings sometimes.
Art,fgtcu4h,t1_fgtcafu,1581102739.0,"no problem :) Also if you're drawing digitally, flipping the imagine horizontally will allow you to notice some mistakes a lot easier too."

Art,fgt71zt,t3_f0ei51,1581100391.0,"That’s why it’s great to ask for a second opinion. When you work on something your nose is right in it and it’s hard to notice those super obvious mistakes. As you draw more and more you’ll start to notice these things better, or even avoid them completely. I wouldn’t be super concerned :) Your eye will develop with time."
Christianity,fgt6xg8,t3_f0ei68,1581100316.0,This is just personal speculation.. But I think if it was a physical place we would see it.

BPD,fgpcvkl,t1_fgmfjxq,1581002222.0,Thanks! I actually treated myself to a nice cafe outing and it definitely helped!
BPD,fgpcujn,t1_fgm4x5j,1581002204.0,Thanks! I'm definitely not good at this. I tend to repress any negative feels until I can't help it anymore. Def need to work on it.

The only thing that super sticks out to me in this drawing are the eyes. The style is vastly different from the rest of the drawing, they’re not anatomically correct and the left eye feels flat and off. You’re totally well on your way though keep drawing :)"
ADHD,ffzy57q,t3_ew6en6,1580395869.0,Whoa thanks for the tip!!! I do this a lot but have the same issue
drawing,ffzxxed,t3_ew6fk8,1580395719.0,If you’d like to get faster with drawing I HGIHLY recommend doing life drawing or something similar where you start off with like 30 second poses. It helped me get a lot faster :) That’s pretty bomb for a 10 min sketch!

Coronavirus,ffzg282,t1_ffzev7z,1580377287.0,"Aw, I'm really sorry to hear that ): I hope you make it through the winter flu-free, and coronavirus free!

Some people are just taking extra precautions to avoid getting sick but a lot of people are really afraid that we have a pandemic on our hands.

Coronavirus,ffzad9q,t3_evzwfz,1580369468.0,It's possible if it was like conspiracy theory or things like that it could have been taken down.
Coronavirus,ffza0au,t3_ew17iy,1580369022.0,Well... how are they going to get their phone or laptop? No one can bring that to them. I'm assuming they didn't exactly get the chance to pack up before going to quarantine. You're right though it is a little weird but considering there's cases outside of China my worry isn't immediately censorship. But this is just speculation of course.

Coronavirus,ffqc3yc,t1_ffqbl7f,1580129915.0,In general the numbers we’re seeing is just on confirmed cases. Which is like less than 3k last I heard (less than an hour ago). But some people think there’s roughly 44k unconfirmed cases right now. But we really don’t know at this point in time.
Coronavirus,ffqc017,t1_ffqbqc1,1580129808.0,From what I understand about viruses.. Once you get one your body conquers it and it stays in you forever so you can never like ‘get it back’. So what actually happens is the flu virus has mutated and spread that there’s just a bunch of different variants now... So technically yeah you could get it once and then be fine after. But if it keeps spreading it would likely mutate and you could get that new version of the virus. But I mean I learned this in like 2013 so don’t take my word for it lol
