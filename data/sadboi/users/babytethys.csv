However, I have a history of being abused by both family and partners, and have a fair amount of fears and specific scenarios that give me anxiety attacks to think/talk about. This movie was a beautiful amalgam of about 90% of my fears and several traumatic scenarios that have happened to me. 

I had to pause several times and step away to calm myself before coming back. I'm very stubborn and often will purposely indulge in media that I know is triggering in order to condition myself to not panic. I couldn't sleep for weeks after but I still endorse it as a very good horror flick.
