Also personally it doesn't seem for me like an gag manga at all. Looks more like it's gonna be an depressed one.
Looking at the small hints, both of them seem to have some problems. The guy something with his home/family and that girl having a REALLY fucked up way on how to cope with people/""friends"" (especially w/ guys)."

Can't rly see her as an family member for many years anymore. Sometimes ask myself if she still remembers since she seems to have a happy life now. Is graduating soon, has a bf(maybe soon husband) and is loved by my parents. Compared to me who is atm unemployed, got kicked out of highschool for skipping too many days, has run away from home twice, am seen as an nuisance to my parents and am being wished by them that I wasn't their real son and that apparently I would make them want to kill themself."

offlineTV,f763ox6,t3_dugyfg,1573422448.0,"Wtf are these people serious?! Why are they even blaming ANYONE ELSE besides THEMSELVE at the first place for spreading the drama?? Have they forgotte  that the first thing they did on twitter was subtweeting she shit out of Lily's problem. Like can't the otv members that tweeted about it not  see how their tweets blew up? Or are they that stupid that they thought by not mentioning the specific problem & person, every thousands of their fans would have no clue who it was?

Just because they are content creators it doesn't give them any right for making an VERY personal problem that public. Like do they not realise what kind of responsibility they have after the many years of streaming, especially poki. 

They really could have instead of spending their time subtweeting, liking tweets, watching the reactions of their friend(Destiny) and looking at it how it enfolds, have dealt it within their friends group first and talk about how it is gonna be in the future. And shut up about it till the actual people in the drama were ready to talk about it. Or is it too much to ask from a bunch of adults? So unprofessional.

Poor lily for what happend to her, being forced to tell us the reason  more quicker than she probably wanted and even having to apologies for her friends. Poor Destiny for speakig the fcking truth and getting a butthurt response from his ""friends"" for not jumping on the drama with them. And respect to the friends (Scarra, Toast and probably many more) that knew about it but kept quiet about it.

Edit: Also respect to Michael Reeves(who is fcking 21) handling it way more professional than most of them smh"

EpicSeven,eoz1435,t3_bs574h,1558950349.0,"Have sent them that problem by email and got days later one back where it said: 


„We've asked for any bugs with regards to your inquiry to our developers, and fortunately, no irregularities have been found. 

I do suggest that you:

1.Talk to a girl that needs the doll then go east. 
2.Talk to a guy that missed his ring. kill slimes, talk to him again and end the quest.
3.Re-enter the quest. Run after the boy that has the doll to north. Kill slime then end the quest.
4.Re-enter again and go west. After killing the purple slime, go back and talk to the woman, she'll give you a ring and her thanks.“


As you can see for some reason they explained to me the walkthrough of that already completed quest, even though I sent them this exact post yours, that is actually carefully explaining where the real problem in it lies. So who knows now how long till they fix that „no bug“."
