That's because they pretty much won't prescribe anything unless it's CBD only which is only S4 and gets automatic approval whereas THC drugs don't. They skew the numbers by not giving actual cannabis. If you look at social media and people being prescribed cannabis containing thc I'd say around 80% are with CDA, 10% with CAC and 10% with the rest.
