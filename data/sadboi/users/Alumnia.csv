If you listen to the lates MMM podcast episode with Julie, she shares the song Maura very likely has been listening to before the accident: You Get What You Give by New Radicals. I can see this in my mind, Maura tired, stressed, shaken from everything going on,  might or might not bit sipping on some booze and as she is driving this song is playing. This scene doesn’t seem like to me as a girl who is running away or prepares to hurt herself, but as a young adult beaten down and needs a weekend to gather herself. 

I share the same opinion and it breaks my heart, that this is when somebody did something to her."

mauramurray,esmk6ff,t1_eshobiz,1562107471.0,"You very well analyzed it! However I would like to add my grain of salt: I have BPD, doing a lot better since I was at the age when Maura went missing. after years of therapy I got a full scholarship to become a psychosocial counselor then once I am done next year I want to move onto the therapist training.

**I am not trying to diagnose Maura, I am only qualified to counsel and support people in psychological crises, not treating or diagnosing them. Below I would only like to share my insight personally.**

 I saw and worked with both bipolar and BPD patients while interning at an assisted living facility (many of the women had a history of hospitalization, abuse MH issues, suicidality and they could move into this shelter instead of becoming homeless).
I had to pack the rooms of women who disappeared, not showed up after a few weeks, or were very likely they killed themselves (left a note etc.) or were “taken” by an angry ex, cult leader or pimp. Instead of going on and on what I am trying to say is I saw many troubled women, many young girls, many girls in pain like Maura. A few who never returned. And no relatives to give their belongings to. Maybe this is why I am interested in Maura’s story, observing from a “safe” distance, hoping she will be found or that people who care about her can rest knowing what happened.

Based on personal and professional experience, Maura might have had BPD but then there should have been a more persistent showing of symptoms that would have been noticed more frequently. Like sudden violent mood swings or increased fear of abandonment, leading to a behavior of her trying to satisfy people or hold onto someone she feels like could satisfy this inner emptiness (might explain promiscuity). However, in a BP psychosis I would find it hard to leave her dorm room packed up, leave the printed out e-mail behind, message Billy, teachers etc. It seems way too organized, almost like “calm after the storm” -> knowing they want to hurt themselves or it just becomes clear that they have to flee the environment to calm down or “get a grip on themselves”, nothing else matters, just to get away a bit. With BPD this kind of sudden isolation is very alarming (“surrendering”), it would be more likely that they would make several very loud cries for help, try to get human contact desperately. IMO this looks more like the roller coaster of feeling very calm and collected between two manic episodes in Bipolar, due to all the stress she was under this cycle might have escalated, switching fast between statuses of being very concentrated and being very impulsive and self-destructive, depressed (hence likely she has been drinking while driving away). As written by others already it is very hard to know exactly what was going on, we don’t have too much info about her emotional situation, how she talked or how her smaller interactions with people were (BPD is better observed there) but basically what we mostly know are her actions, their results and the emerging pattern imo shows an issue with mood regulation that then affected her actions (stealing, purging etc.). This is present both with BPD and Bipolar, but in my opinion what happened leans more towards what I saw with ladies suffering from their Bipolar symptoms when crises happened.

The podcast MMM had an episode where they talked with a forensic psychologist and he shared great insight. What it leaves me wondering however, is if Maura ever seeked out a counselor or any form of getting help? Regardless if she could have had a diagnosis or not, she was in serious distress and I wish there was some kind of resource or intervention she have used or gotten help by. I cheered out loud for a moment when during the podcast interview with her supervisor, the supervisor offered Maura after/during her breakdown to escort her to the campus clinic (in the hope of seeing a mental health professional I assume). I know there are bigger questions to answer but I can’t help but wonder... as a nursing student she must have known of resources and mental health issues, yet we have no information if she ever reached out to resources? I know these services can be anonymous, but I assume that when we suspect someone to be in danger or hurt, the information has to be released? ((From Vienna, Austria, I am not up to date with local law))"
