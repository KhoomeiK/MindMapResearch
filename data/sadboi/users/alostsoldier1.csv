BPD,fp4487g,t3_gazy08,1588291362.0,"Honestly one of the worst parts of being borderline is catching feelings so quickly. It seems almost as if anyone who gives me even the slightest bit of attention can make me envision a future with them. The worst part of it all is knowing that it’s all so unrealistic, yet feels so real. To the point where you can’t distinguish between the two and ur left questioning every broken piece of u, hoping they’d come back in ur life and ‘fix you’. But that too is another delusion because they usually don’t care, and even if they did ur almost always the one caring a lot more. It really hurts."

prozac,f87opj1,t3_dzccni,1574338891.0,Currently my fifth week on Prozac and definitely feel a lot more anxious (esp after going up to 40mg) rly hope the anxiety subsides.
prozac,f6i38gg,t1_f6i0y02,1572871115.0,"Quite honestly the side effects are terrible for me and I’m considering either lowering my dosage down to 40mg or stopping completely. The main side effects I have r hand tremors-even my legs get shaky, excessive sweating in my hands (I already had it before but it’s a lot worse now), increases social anxiety, inability to write well due to my hand tremors and overall always feeling hyper-vigilant and panicky. But Prozac works differently for everyone and maybe it’ll be good for u at 60mg but with my personal experience I wouldn’t recommend that."

bulimia,exfcovo,t1_exfah7s,1566237681.0,"I wish I knew. She never even mentioned heart pains to me at all. She used to always be dizzy though and sometimes she would faint when I travel and tell me through text. Gosh I feel like this is my fault, I should’ve been there."
bulimia,ew8fw4g,t3_cnaswq,1565208971.0,"As u said it’s just water.

Water has 0 calories, regardless of how full it makes you feel.

You must distinguish fullness and fatness because they are different things.

If water made people ‘fat’, anorexic people would not drink it. But they do, and they are skinnier than the entire population, because it actually has no calories in it so it simply fills you up making you get that feeling of fullness without having to over indulge with high cal foods which usually don’t even give you this feeling of being full, or do but only after you exceed your cal count.

Keep going and keep ur head up, you can do this. Feel free to message me whenever u want too."
bulimia,evrvbgx,t1_evqyjz1,1564719643.0,"The more I read your comment, the more I realize how inconsiderate and rude you are. If OP ‘wanted validation’ to continue her bad behaviors she wouldn’t be on this subreddit, telling people she’s concerned and will try her best to stop b/p. 

It’s just intriguing how you make stopping purging sound so simple as if OP wants to continue, she clearly doesn’t. I feel for OP, she probably had a tough past and is suffering now for 3 years as she mentioned.

Ig what I’m trying to say is, instead of going and patronizing her for trying to get help and stop her addiction, try to support her to stop healthily, instead of forcefully by making her feel ashamed of herself. I can assure you that if she wasn’t already feeling like shit about herself she wouldn’t have typed this entire post up in the first place. Let’s all try to be considerate and keep in mind that purging IS an addiction, similarly to how drugs are..."
bulimia,eugmoyz,t3_cgd80j,1563810904.0,"I’m 21 years old and lost one of my front teeth last month from being bulimic. I went to the dentist and got tooth transplant for 3000 dollars. Had to ask my parents and all relatives for money and it was very sad but I did it and worked my ass off with 2 jobs.

You can also get it cheaper if you go to a sketchier place but it won’t be that good looking. 

Wish u the best of luck my dude"

depression,epxp66j,t3_bwfizj,1559606979.0,"I totally feel you. People usually ‘dislike’ or look down at people whom look shy and weak already. They are the ‘perfect targets’. I suggest you take a good look into your tone, posture, clothing and hygiene/overall look. These factors could really make you a bit target. Also, the more a person seems like they are conscious about themselves, the more people will get that idea and use it to manipulate them into thinking they are worthy of less.
