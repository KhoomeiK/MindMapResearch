Literally blurred like you’d see in a “haunted” photo faded background with his photo cutting in behind mine. I think I binned it..."
AskDad,fr3wdkg,t3_gmfy2d,1589868155.0,Oh man! I feel for your hubby! Getting out of hospitality is HARD! I worked in hospo for 10 years and no one outside of the industry would hire me because I had no other experience beside hospo. I got out June last year and I’m in my second year of studying full time at uni via distance. He may need to do some kind of course to up skill or change fields. Good luck though 😊😊😊
CPTSD,fqrwerx,t3_gk5417,1589593330.0,Yes! I LOVE blankets. Sadly I had a mink blanket growing up so they’re a trigger for me but I have fluffy blankets and a feather duvet. Best thing ever dragging the duvet to the couch and watching tv with hot cup of tea. So cozy.
relationship_advice,fqozjk4,t3_gk0u0e,1589529767.0,Tell her your boyfriend wasn’t the one for you and if he can’t handle your sister being there then she did you a favour. Tell her that’s what families do for each other. They make sacrifices for one another and you’re totally okay with it. My sister who’s also 15 lives with me after running away from home and calling me to pick her up. She knows I’d choose her over my partner any time and that she’s always welcome in my home no matter what ☺️
mentalillness,fqoo85s,t1_fqonvu4,1589520111.0,Thank you. I’ll send an email today. I feel terrible about it but I know that the therapy is for me and that I need to find someone who I feel comfortable with. I get texts saying to confirm my appointment the day before which I didn’t confirm so didn’t expect today’s session to be on (we were out) so I was just going to leave it.

MoneyDiariesACTIVE,fq4rbls,t3_ggs3xt,1589082347.0,"Hi Lovely, 
I worked in hospitality for 10 years as both a chef & waitress, bar manager, head chef, cafe manager and barista (basically I could do everything) and there wasn’t a time I wasn’t miserable. It stole so many years away from my son with late nights, long shifts, shitty people to work with, even shittier bosses and for minimum wage 99% of the time. So I can totally feel some parts of why you don’t want to go back to hospo. I’m pretty introverted but was forced to be extroverted while at work. Last year I quit my job to focus on studying and a future career FAR FAR FAR away from hospitality. I’m studying to be a psychologist now in my second year. I’m home every night with my son and am able to drop him off and pick him up from school. I have food in my fridge finally that gets used (normally son would be at my mothers and I’d eat at work or not eat at all). Take this opportunity to do something different. It’s a fresh start so go do something worth while. I always felt hospo was a dead-end job. Good luck 😊"

AvPD,fpusjcb,t3_gfdblp,1588922244.0,I have not spoken to my mother since early June last year and have only just rekindled my relationship with my dad but we aren’t close. I keep in touch for his benefit more than my own. I don’t speak to any other family either. My whole family is toxic or money hungry and selfish so I just do my own thing. Sometimes I do crave that family life but it’s okay. I’ve got my own little family
relationship_advice,fpu2cuk,t3_gfg8ke,1588903180.0,I would tell your son. That is far beyond creepy and you should keep trying to confront your husband about it. I was abused for many years and nothing was ever done about it so please don’t just shove this under the rug. Do something and good luck. I’m sure many of us would love an update  too
CPTSD,fpqofo9,t1_fpqnuc3,1588827751.0,"Thank you for your kind words. I definitely, like you, see parts of my mother in myself but I ignore them and remind myself that I’m not her. Every single day. It’s almost my “positive affirmation” I repeat over and over"
unpopularopinion,fpqklu3,t3_getson,1588825010.0,"Ugh my old boss was a “wine” mom. I never understood it. Mind you.. I don’t drink alcohol at all.

Then what? 🤷🏼‍♀️"
abuse,fpkz270,t1_fpkfrtq,1588703513.0,That’s probably the best thing to do. It’s a shame your parents feel so powerless in the situation. Good luck with moving out though :)
abuse,fpjd59q,t3_gdqyxz,1588664212.0,"Hmm. Sounds a lot like my little sister who’s now 16. I was never scared of her but my mother and other siblings were. She’s a solid girl and used to steal, physically abuse those close to her etc. my mum took her to see a mental health place and she got put on anti depressants and the same as your brother she would act “perfect” around “outsiders” and no one could understand what was going on behind closed doors. I don’t speak to her and haven’t done so for about a year or so now so I don’t know how she’s getting on. And I don’t speak to our mother either. But having said that I think sister has ADHD, depression and has a learning disability. I would suggest you get out ASAP and your parents kick him out too. It’s not fair on yourself or your parents to put up with this behaviour. Maybe he has had some trauma (sexual or emotional) that could be deep down cause. I don’t know the full story and every story has more than one side to it. Good luck though lovely 😊"
Anxiety,fpbyamk,t3_gcdc8a,1588481954.0,I did it a LOT when I was younger and definitely think talking to yourself is normal. When my abuse started I noticed that I spoke to myself more and more and by the time I was 10 I was full on 12 hours a day yabbering to myself. I had some damn cool conversations with myself too! I also used to make up little stories in my head while trying to sleep. I read a few weeks back that this is a coping mechanism (especially the fantasy stuff) because it’s a “safe place” where you don’t get judgement from others and you can talk/think things through. I don’t do it as much as an adult besides thinking “what the f***” and that kind of thing but no conversations going on.
internetparents,fpbq06y,t3_gc8ddf,1588475849.0,"It’s hard when parents are like that huh. My father is the same. He sees a counsellor but the counsellor doesn’t seem to help much. It’s fantastic that you are seeing a therapist yourself. I’m proud of you for doing that. It’s a huge step and healing can take a long time. But as you look back you’ll see the progress you’ve made and hopefully be proud of yourself too. I’m studying to become a psychologist and it’s hard to watch my father and his MH go up and down. I’ve recommended many therapies and he throws them all in my face. My partner has to remind me that (and I quote) “you can’t help someone until they want to help themselves”. That being said, you could get separate therapists, I’m sure there’s things both of you aren’t comfortable talking about with each other in the room so it might be beneficial for you both to have neutral therapists that can help you through your own issues and help you both to understand how to deal with them safely and understand where each person is coming from. Just an idea :) but DM me any time you feel"
internetparents,fpay05e,t3_gc8ddf,1588458062.0,"Hi sweetie, it’s sad for me to read this post. Mostly because my own mother was unloving and incapable of it as well. I know it hurts and it probably won’t stop hurting. That’s the awful truth. If you can, get away from her and start fresh. There is a lot of support out there ( including us internet parents) so reach out. Ask your therapist if they know of any support places you could get help from. From your mother’s perspective, she is probably hurting as well. And that’s not your fault either. Maybe she needs to go see a therapist too?"
PepTalksWithPops,fp8qq1w,t1_fp8iv7z,1588399903.0,I’m very understanding of past experiences and trauma so I understand but helping my pops is hard. He’s so revengeful and angry and doesn’t want to get better
CPTSD,fp8oen2,t3_gbrx3f,1588397909.0,"I agree with you to some extent. I suffered for years but then I decided to take charge of my life. It’s a huge work in progress but I’m getting there. I started taking medication, telling myself I’m okay, I’m safe and that I’m loved. The biggest thing I regret is not doing it sooner. I’m in my second year of studying a BA in psychology and it’s helped with my healing process so much. I’m not “healed” and I do get days where I want to lay in bed, cry, feel emotionless, triggered etc and on those days I do all of those things. I think abuse manifests in each victim differently and no one can know what someone else went through truly.

CPTSD,fox7han,t1_fox5jki,1588135988.0,It’s probably one of the most degrading things to have on top of all the trauma and I hate that it’s come back to haunt me out of the blue. I don’t speak to my mom anymore and almost a year ago now my half sibling ran away from home and came to live with me so she’s a bit of a constant reminder of my past but I try to look past that because I know I’m not evil.

CPTSD,fox49p5,t3_g9sf5g,1588133715.0,"Yes absolutely. I had younger siblings however. I struggled to make friends because of the sexual abuse I suffered I wanted to keep anyone that was a potential friend away because I wanted to protect them and not tell them what was going on. I used to talk to myself a LOT and dissociate as well. My mother constantly accused me of lying and “stealing” food out of the cupboard (I had one meal a day). I lacked a lot of social skills because of that and don’t have many friends nowadays either but I’m okay with it now. 
I’m sorry you went through such loneliness too. It’s an Awful thing to go through. Especially when it’s your parents making you feel that way. Pm me if you feel lonely. I’m happy to chat about anything and listen to anything too :)"

I wash underwear and socks after one day of wear and clothes after every second wear sometimes stretch it out to a third wear if they’re clean (stain free and not stinky). Use fabric softener but only once a month or so to keep clothes soft and smelling nice. 
Shower every day (in the morning gets you ready for the day being fresh and clean)
Shave every second day (unless you like having a beard) and use deodorant daily. And brush your teeth twice a day. If clothes are old and worn out then keep them for doing stuff around the house so that your new, nice clothes don’t get ruined. Oh and get new shoes too.

Stupidly I said no but they’re due back any second. He then asked to come inside and wait for them. Dog sensed something was up and stood at my side and growled at the man. I said it’s best if he left and came back another time when they’re home otherwise my dog would eat him. He instantly left and never saw him again. Told parents as soon as they got home.

On my last session my counsellor said, and i quote “you’ll never make a good psychologist because you don’t do mindfulness and you don’t have good boundaries in place for people around you. You do too much for others and nothing for yourself” I’m sure that this shouldn’t be said by someone in her field of work. I discussed this with my new psychologist and he said I have many qualities that a psychologist needs to have and he agreed that counsellor although nice people aren’t all that great at what they do."
CPTSD,flzvx3n,t3_fs4dvf,1585635269.0,"I’m the same but for different reasons and only when men sigh. I hate men being angry at me. And I hate men doing cleaning if I’m busy doing stuff that isn’t cleaning. It makes my anxiety hit the roof. 
But don’t worry. You’re not psycho or “that” person. I’m sure your husband understands 🤗"
AskWomen,flqbwtl,t3_fqedsw,1585388027.0,In June last year I stopped talking to my toxic mother and other family members. In January this year we moved towns and I told my younger sister who still lived with my mother that we were moving to a different town than we actually were. Then legally changed my name. Set up new social media and started as fresh as I could. It feels wonderful and I have absolutely no regrets. It’s helped me heal and grow and allowed me to be who I really am. I don’t have to look over my shoulder when out shopping etc. if it’s what you truly want then go for it.
CPTSD,fllzni1,t3_fpn78b,1585271203.0,I was very much the same. I was happy telling my story etc but when it came to actually doing anything to heal myself I didn’t care either. I’m still a bit like this now after a year of therapy. I’m doing EMDR and also on anti depressants. I’m studying to become a psychologist (a field I’m fascinated by) so my mentality now is “how can I help others when i need to help myself first?” I think everyone needs a passion. Something to live for and strive for. Cut all the negative people and triggers from your life. Change your name etc. I did and it feels a bit better. Good luck with your journey x
MomForAMinute,flc5y3z,t3_fnwjhz,1585020768.0,Good on you for taking the initiative in getting the implants. I’ve had them twice already and when my younger sister came to live with me I got her to get them too
toastme,fklqj3u,t3_fj0k6e,1584312377.0,Hugs hon. My cat who was missing for a couple of weeks got run over too. We saw him about 10km up the road from our house. He was intact but then a person in a 4wd ran his head over on purpose right in front of my sister and I 😢 so I totally understand your pain x
MomForAMinute,fjjep3l,t1_fjjds0p,1583392782.0,Thank you ☺️
MomForAMinute,fjjde34,t1_fjjd573,1583391302.0,"It was a decision I didn’t take lightly. I got sick of my mother spreading rumours, calling me the town bike when I’ve been in a committed relationship for a few years, belittling me and so on. I do still talk to my dad and visit him regularly so at least I still have a parent. I don’t have many friends and I’m incredibly introverted and overwhelmingly self conscious but thank you 😊 
P.s. sometimes I do wish I had an older brother 😂"
toastme,fijbvc6,t3_f84vcj,1582441289.0,"Hey beautiful! I’m doing EMDR too and I totally understand it is tough! But it’s so amazing you’ve taken that step to heal from past trauma. I wish I’d sought help earlier than I did. I’m in my second year of study to become a psychologist so please feel free to message me any time day or night. I’m happy to be a listening ear 🤗
Edit to say that goes for anyone feeling low.I’m pretty good at replying except when I’ve got assessments on that need all the concentration I can muster x"

childfree,f6hjckh,t1_f6hj9z6,1572851058.0,I’ve got a quite a few years left of my study towards my dream career and a child would definitely put a damper on my plans and I’d begin to resent it (which would be totally unfair to an innocent baby)
childfree,f6hhjg8,t1_eyqbvlg,1572848658.0,"Sorry I only just saw your reply! I definitely wouldn’t let my mum raise any of my children. After 10 years of trying to be the adult and get along/build an okay relationship with her I’ve called it quits. She’s toxic, nasty and has a lot of issues. No way would I let her anywhere near children"
self,f6hfkv8,t3_dr266o,1572846275.0,"I hear you! I’ve just finished my first year in University, I’m a single mum and also have my 15 year old sister in my care. I am seeing someone but I try not to rely on them financially but he does help when I’m desperate. There’s been sooo many times I’ve wanted to drop out of uni as I’m also battling a couple of mental health issues but I know staying in uni is the right thing to do. Hard work pays off. Try get some work in your field of study if you haven’t already... that will help you feel like you’re getting somewhere. I hate being poor too. I grew up in lower class and we couldn’t afford any luxuries and now I’m a student sacrifices have to be made. It’s just the way life is. One step forward one step back. But it’s better than moving nowhere. Good luck 😊"
childfree,eyreh8g,t1_eyqbvlg,1567366546.0,Absolutely not. My mums a terrible woman. I’ve actually cut all ties with her. Haven’t spoken to her in months
childfree,eyrefe3,t3_cy63fp,1567366507.0,Absolutely not
childfree,eyqa8ui,t3_cy63fp,1567333870.0,I have an 8 year old son. Never wanted kids and I’m absolutely certain of that. I got lucky with my son and he’s fantastic. He’s awesome. Previous relationships wanted kids and I didn’t so eventually it came to an end. I got pregnant (miscarried) and before the miscarriage my mum offered to adopt the baby and raise it if I didn’t want it. I’m in the process of getting my tubes tied. Luckily I’ve found someone amazing who doesn’t want kids of his own so there’s no pressure to have more than the one
