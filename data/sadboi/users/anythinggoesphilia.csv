I know that skipping sugar altogether makes my depression worse (almost like a diabetic even though I'm not), while other are completely unaffected by it. For muscle hypertrophy, the common knowledge is that high volume is the way to go, but for me, my body does not respond. I have to incorporate more strength training than the average person if I want my muscles to grow. It's similar to how everyone responds to psychotropic medication differently.

When I was around 5 years old, my mother and I traveled to her home village in Central Mexico. Me, being the bratty child I was, decided to start bothering a dog to the point that it tried to bite me. Of course, I freaked out and started crying. Never did that again.

Anyway, about a week later, I come back home to the US. According to my parents, I started to exhibit the signs of ""susto,"" so they took me to a *curandero* (basically a witch doctor). What I remember was a really old lady telling me to take off my shirt, and she started rubbing half a lemon on my back. When she was done, I turned around and the DAMN SURFACE OF THE LEMON WAS BLACK. In my head, I thought maybe I just had a dirty back, but looking back now, unless I had rolled around in ash, there's no way that thing should've looked black. According to the old lady, I had *susto*.

A short time later, they took me to another curandero. What I remember from this one is that they lead me to a bedroom that had a kid sleeping in the middle of the bed, and they told me to lay down next to the kid. When I did, the *curandero* took up a leafy tree branch, and started waving it over me and the sleeping kid while muttering a bunch of nonsense. After that event, they said I was ""cured."" 

Honestly, that whole event gave me more *susto* than the dog growling at me in the beginning."
