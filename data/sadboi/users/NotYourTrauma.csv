Aside from his ED/libido he is everything I need in a partner so it's not something that I push, just mention when I come across something here.

Talking in person can be difficult, once it became apparent I was unsure of how to talk without being afraid of sounding like I was being accusatory or negative I turned to texting him. This may seem like a 'way out' but it's truly worked for us as far as communicating about this particular topic. 

Since leaving the house isnt exactly an option at the moment HeyDoctor is something he may want to check out. It offers a virtual health visit where he can be evaluated for medication and it can be purchased through GoodRx (which is very inexpensive).

Just let him know how you're feeling, things he does/has done that cause you to have negative feelings. Prior to this I would recommend considering different outcomes of the conversation and what you might want. Is a potential sexless relationship something you can handle? I didn't think so, but come to find out it's actually great. That's not to say I don't want sex, but other areas are so fulfilling that I don't feel empty without it. The lack of affection still nags at me, but we are working on it.

If a sexless relationship is something you can't handle then you are going to want to consider what is best for you and evaluate whether or not you're willing to move forward and work on the relationship (if your partner is willing) or move on.

Please understand I am not advocating for you to up and leave your SO. I worked on a terribly broken marriage for far longer than necessary. My vote will almost always go towards trying. That being said, taking care of your emotional health is more important."

Here is my story...my parents divorced when I was 3, my dad was in a LTR until my step mom passed away in 2015 and recently began seeing a woman. He's 54 and was raised during a time where consent was more or less directly related to intercourse. 

The woman he is seeing has not reacted well to his advances (hello and goodbye kisses, nothing agressive). This saddened him greatly and he did what anyone with a smart phone would do and asked Google, which is when he learned more about consent in 2019. Then he called me and I told him that unless he's preventing her from falling on her ass he needs to ask if it's ok before touching her at all. 

He was understanding but I could tell by his voice a little confused, fortunately he took my advice and adjusted his behavior! Now they're seeing each other and things are no longer 'weird' according to him.

I cross stitch and its soothing, theres not a whole lot of thought that goes into it so my brain is able to slow down. Other ideas that might work for you could be knitting or crocheting, coloring etc.

Something as simple as brushing your teeth, using the bathroom 1 last time, taking meds (if applicable), then on noise machine, confirm alarms are set and burrito roll self.

Hopefully I haven't repeated anything anyone else has said!"
CPTSD,ewed2mp,t3_cnsqi3,1565320544.0,"Literally anything that is validating or reassuring. Such as the aforementioned ""you're not in trouble/I'm not mad at you"" or sometimes I feel that I need reassurance that I am loved/wanted for me and not what I can do for someone or give them.

I am still working on what I really need but when I am hesitant to talk or ask for what I want, taking the time to think about why and what would make me feel better or less hesitant helps."

Nothing wrong with that at all"

The above is just an example, but it was a constant for me."

CPTSD,eseleth,t3_c7bene,1561902771.0,"Once you have a job, and save up a bit of money I recommend taking a day to pamper yourself. It has taken me more than a decade to feel comfortable doing this but I am finally to the point of getting a pedicure once a month. I'd like to do it every two weeks but I can't justify spending the money (even though I could do it, that doesnt matter, I have to convince myself I am deserving) and I sometimes push it to every 5 or 6 weeks.

Sometimes I go nuts and get a massage! 

As for honing your skills in the kitchen, YouTube is a great place to find videos! I'm happy to recommend some of my favorites if you like. 

You are so brave and deserving of this new life that you are building!"

I just want him to know that I often hide from him just how bad it can be and want him to understand that I'm not explaining this for attention, I truly feel it is imperative for him to understand what me deteriorating looks like. Or what it looks like when I am manic or depressed."

raisedbyborderlines,eruczaa,t3_c3vs4i,1561272986.0,"Try www.nurx.com I have heard good things and you dont need insurance. You might have to pay for the birth control but the fees seem to be minimal ($12 per year for consultation/prescription renewal and without insurance $15 and up per month for the method you choose, which you'll get help with). They offer the pill, patch and I believe the ring.

Hopefully that's helpful, and isn't out of your price range. I know places like planned parenthood aren't always convenient. I'm sorry you didn't get a better answer when you reached out to someone you should be able to count on."
bisexual,erqpmyt,t1_erqpfjz,1561148986.0,"Sometimes it's better not to try, let them draw their own conclusions. Explaining the color purple to someone who has been blind from birth is likely to drive you insane. As long as you have a clear understanding and are comfortable with how you understand it then (as I see it) that's all that matters!"
bisexual,erqlf1l,t1_erqatip,1561146135.0,"I know you're getting some hate for your question but I feel like you're truly trying to educate yourself and the short answer is yes.

I am bi, I am dating a man, I still fantasize about women and occasionally point out a hot chick to my BF. That doesn't mean I'm going to leave him for a woman.

If we were to break up, I would eventually start dating again and I wouldn't limit myself to either men or women. I would seek out both and see who I was compatible with. It's possible I might spend some time exclusively dating women since it's been a while, but that wouldn't make me a lesbian."

CPTSD,epyn9ye,t3_bwe0cr,1559644707.0,"I relate so hard to the dramatic outbursts! It's like I can't help it and it's usually a crying/sobbing/wailing fit. These are usually at times where I can hide them and I'm not in public (because I've shoved down so many little outbursts they all come out at once). My boyfriend hasn't seen this yet and I fear for the day he does.

He is very validating,  but I'm still a validation whore."
