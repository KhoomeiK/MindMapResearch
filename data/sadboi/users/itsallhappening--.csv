NoStupidQuestions,fps438l,t3_gf3v4t,1588867124.0,"Whenever I see a group of people walking around using their phones I think of what people 80 years ago would be thinking if they saw that. I’m sure just the mass amount of people who have these devices readily available for use at all times and the sheer amount of things we can do on them would be absolutely mind blowing- almost like science fiction to them. We’re all so encapsulated by our devices now they’re essentially the very fabric of our modern day society.

Insane to think that we’d look like some weird Jetsons future people to people from way back when."

90smusic,fpdkir5,t1_fpcj12n,1588528791.0,"Ok so some resources are very old threads on the site lipstickalley.com or you could just type in Jordan Knight’s wife in google and some sites will appear but you’ll have to do some digging.

I’ll start with the status of his marriage and what’s going on now. He’s currently taking a really long social media break. He only started back posting/interacting during this whole virus thing because the guys are doing lives and did a virtual cruise. Otherwise he hasn’t posted regularly in over a year. His social media activity has declined a LOT since 2016. The theory is that it has something to do with his viewing nudes and chatting with women on Instagram dms. It seems after one incident he just stopped viewing fans dms and instagram stories. Maybe his wife found out and gave him an ultimatum. This has been years in the making honestly. He’s been doing shady things online since the reunion era circa 2009.

He was caught in 2018? last messaging a catfish who  was actually a fan who is out to expose him. There were screenshots and he did seem interested then when he found out it was a fake he proceeded to argue with the catfish. She posted them all. 

He is notorious for viewing fans dms- like every single one he gets he seems to look at- as well as stories. If it’s nudes he looks too and sometimes responds if you have some sort of connection with him or if you’re a non-fan who he doesn’t think will talk. His responses have been consistent and not incriminating...they vary from emojis to one word replies to let you know he likes what he sees.

Basically, he’s a online nudes creeper. People have theories that he cheated/is cheating on his wife but no one has solid proof. There is gossip that goes back pre 2016 that I could share if you’d like! There’s so much! And soo many specifics."

mentalillness,fnwbgq5,t1_fnvk1ox,1587315180.0,"These sort of thoughts are normal for those who have been in your predicament- does not at all mean it’ll happen. The fact that what happened to you was done to you by a family member makes it all the more confusing as a child. There are several seemingly “taboo” facets here for a young child to try and understand. 

Your brother is safe. You won’t do anything like that to him just because it was done to you. Why? Because you are not a shitty human being. Also accept that intrusive, weird thoughts are normal. Even people who have not been molested or had a traumatic event happen to them have weird thoughts that come completely out of nowhere. These thoughts make you question yourself, what you believe, what kind of person you are and the kind of person others are. The most important thing to remember is that these are just random thoughts. They are not based in reality and likely will never happen. It is just how your brain is sorting out the mixed emotions and trauma from your childhood abuse. Accept that those weird thoughts are strangely normal and they are not real in any way. The thoughts say nothing about who you are and your reality. You are safe and you know your brother is safe- from you doing any of these things to him. You’re not a bad person. 

It may help a LOT if you talked to your brother. I think it’ll give you some solace and would allow you both to “grieve”? together. That is- if it did happen to him. If it happened to him too you could then be there to comfort your brother and that in and of itself will make you feel like more of his protector. If the abuse did not occur to him you will then know he is okay. I’m sure subconsciously that’ll make you feel a lot better too. It’s the not knowing and the what if’s. The questions that need to be answered. After you talk to him about it I’m sure the thoughts of you doing something like that to him will go away. It will also help with the reverse thoughts of him doing this to you. There seems to be a disconnect. The bridge needs to be gapped, deep conversation needs to be had, and those intrusive thoughts will occur less often or will maybe even go away completely.

As for your abuser, not sure if you’ve ever told anyone in your family or confronted him but maybe that could be an option? You need to get closure on a lot of things, close the book in order to feel okay."
birthcontrol,fntnnln,t3_g3jbyj,1587245298.0,I will be joining you within the next two months. It fucking suucks.
mentalillness,fntmnlv,t3_g3qr7f,1587244722.0,"First, accept that the abuse was not your fault in any way. You are not homosexual or bisexual because this happened to you. The traumatic experience you endured in childhood was not something you had the power to stop or maybe even fully understand. So don’t blame yourself or ever feel like you have to be gay or secretly gay because you were molested by someone of the same sex. What your cousin did was WRONG, EVIL, and DISGUSTING. If he hasn’t come out already HE is the one who may be gay or bisexual. There is nothing wrong with it if he is. What’s wrong is that you did not consent and depending on you guy’s ages it was maybe even quite illegal. I think once you let go of the internalized blame and possible doubts of your own sexuality you will be fine. There has to be some of that going on, I’d assume. 

Just because your cousin did those things to you does not mean all gay men are to blame. This was just one sick family member. Try to see gay men as people- people just like you and not scapegoats for your repressed anger or disgust towards what your cousin did to you. The blame is on HIM and HIM only. The only person you should be disgusted with is him. I know that it is hard because you want to shift that disgust to men who in some small way remind you of the type of person you see your cousin as or the type of person you don’t want to be.

You are who you are and if you are a straight male you’re just that! No one would blame you or think you are homosexual based on the abuse that occurred. So please be kind to others and accept that the only person that should receive hate is your cousin. Not because he is or isn’t homosexual- but because he is a terrible PERSON who molested a child.

Everything “gay” isn’t bad. There are many.lovely gay people out there. Try watching a documentary or a video on what some homosexual men go through, their lives, anything that will help you relate in some way. Then you’ll be able to see some similarities between them and yourself as well as accept that your sexual preferences are different and that is ok."
BPD,fntko4j,t1_fnsxvmx,1587243579.0,Thanks! I’m glad I finally realized it. My repressed memories from childhood make soo much sense now.
BPD,fnstv0z,t1_fnslof9,1587228689.0,For the longest time I thought my childhood was great. I mean my parents never abused me. I had everything I needed and more. My mom loved me unconditionally. My dad did live in a different state than we did but I spoke to him as often as I wanted and he’s the best. But as I became an adult I realized that my mom’s belittling and criticism of me affected me in ways even I don’t fully understand. I think I blocked it out? I always knew she was hard on me and my brother compared to my friends’ parents but I never thought it’d affect me psychologically. I am just now uncovering this actually and I have mixed feelings about my mom. It’s hard because like I said I know she loves me deeply. The crazy ways she showed her love destroyed me.
relationships,fnqsev8,t3_g39ag4,1587171210.0,Female here. Eh this is just what guys do.
AskWomen,fnnset4,t3_g2qmhs,1587100339.0,"I’ve always had a good relationship with my dad. My parents split when I was a toddler so never knew them as a unit. My dad has always lived in a different state. I love him. He’s the best. The end.

I had a terrible relationship with my mom as a kid and as a teenager. She was extremely overbearing, critical, a helicopter parent, and just plain toxic. When I moved out and started college I started to like her more and understand why she did some of the things she did to me. 

Later, my boyfriend helped me see the light when I mentioned to him the fucked up things my mom has done to me (like steal money, do illegal tax things involving me) but I still defended her behavior because I know she loves me unconditionally and that’s hard for me to ignore. 

Now I’ve reached a new chapter. I am pretty sure I have borderline personality disorder and the more I think about it- I blame her and how critical she was with me and my brother in our childhood. She meant well most of the time and I know she loves me- but she also screwed us up in ways I probably don’t even know or realize.

So I’m conflicted in how I feel about her. We’ve never not been on speaking terms. This is probably because of my BPD and fear of abandonment. I just keep it casual with her. I no longer treat her as if she’s my friend. My mom has done some pretty messed up things and she should be held accountable."

BorderlinePDisorder,fn8rike,t3_g02udm,1586748374.0,I totally understand how you feel. I get reaaally impulsive when someone does something that makes me feel slighted in the least bit. I have word vomit and I have to give them a piece of my mind right then and there. I don’t hold back. But what’s been working for me lately is writing our my feelings in a diary app on my phone. Then I listen to angry/hate music- for some reason that does the trick. I may talk on the phone with a friend and vent a little. I also try to tell myself if they really don’t care and don’t love me I’ll know for sure eventually. In the meantime I just have to let things flow naturally and trust that they won’t hurt me and they do care UNTIL something shows me for absolute certain that they don’t give a shit.
BPD,fn8qsw5,t1_fn7rifj,1586747860.0,Yeah this is totally me. I just don’t think it’s affecting the intensity of the emotions I feel. I was actually thinking about going on an anti anxiety med too. I’ve been strongly considering combining the Bupropion with Lexapro. I think I just need both. Anxiety is what makes me “act out”. I think we are treating the depression but not the anxiety we feel that is the root of why we have these episodes.
BPD,fn8q9e5,t1_fn7jbxs,1586747484.0,"It may be the guys you’re into though? I usually go for the shy, quiet types or guys I just see all the time anyway- the ones I just FEEL are my definition of boyfriend material. I don’t try to do this. It’s just literally who my brain is usually attracted to. It’s like I have this built in mechanism to detect bullshit. I’m able to quickly gauge if they’ll be quick to cheat on me or leave me. This happens without me even noticing usually. I just start to really like the guy. Then once I develop a crush it becomes a fun game to make them mine. So it’s all about the guy. Some guys will hurt and/or leave ANY girl. No matter how beautiful, witty, or smart. What type of guys do you usually go for?"
BPD,fn7icai,t3_fzqoar,1586720914.0,I have social anxiety disorder also so for me it’s: starting fights or mentioning something I know I shouldn’t but not caring at that moment. Just letting my anger flow and doing crazy things for attention so that the person won’t leave. Doing this over and over again. It’s extremely hard for me to stop or calm down or walk away. There’s a huge part of me who is also really prudent and not impulsive so it’s a push and pull constantly. I know exactly what the outcome will be but I still do it and push my FP away.

Sometimes I end up finding them attractive when initially I was just doing an “experiment” of sorts.

I admit it is very easy for me to make people fall for me. It’s dangerous because it makes me feel powerful. I always have to have a boyfriend- like at all times. Can’t imagine being single and alone."
