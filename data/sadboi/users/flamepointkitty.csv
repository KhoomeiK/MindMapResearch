CaregiverSupport,fnfp58y,t1_fn2hwa7,1586912547.0,"When my normal (whatever that means) son was 23 we insisted he move out because we had given up on trying to live with him. Until he went to college a couple of years we got along very well but things turned ugly. As it turned out, his move to an apartment one hour away finally revealed that he had the most serious case of bipolar you can imagine. He was hospitalized for over a week and ended up at home with us, where he lives to this day, at age 37.

Unless you have a problem like that, there is no way it's a bad idea to move away from the parents. And if by chance you do...better to find out now rather than later. 

My autistic son developed schizophrenia that same year. He missed his brother a lot. I understand why you feel stuck there. It isn't fun to move on when your brother isn't able to. üò≠"
