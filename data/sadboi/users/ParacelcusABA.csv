It's designed to sell a thoroughly unchallenging version of Christianity to an audience of middle class white conservatives. The notion that God doesn't demand much more of you than saying a believer's prayer once in your life and maybe pretending to read the Bible every once in a while is very appealing to people who would otherwise find that their society and lifestyle might not mesh with what Christianity is really about. 

As for the main question, no Christian denomination that I've ever encountered has ever suggested that ""justification by correct belief"" is a part of their doctrine. All of them regard justification as the result of the grace of God. The importance of correct belief is that it properly communicates to the believer how best to cooperate with and receive the grace of God. Believing the wrong thing isn't sinful, it just makes your goal harder. It's like baseball: not knowing the rules doesn't get you ejected from the game, but it makes it very difficult to win.

RadicalChristianity,fq8x2uf,t3_gh4ywz,1589178101.0,"My standard intro to the book is this: It is *not* an entry-level read by any stretch of the imagination. Miranda was a doctorate-level scholar in both philosophy and biblical criticism and it really does show in this particular book. Here's a representative passage to give you an idea of what you're looking at here:

>As Wieser and Bultmann observe, the importance of the Hebrew verb *he'min* for out understanding of the New Testament faith is deduced from the fact that the Septuagint uses *pistis* only to translate this root, and it uses *pisteuein* only (with the exception of Jer. 25:8 *sm'*) to translate this root. The exception itself is only an apparent one, for there they use *pisteunein* only for variation; in Jer. 25:7 they had just translated *sm'* by *akouein* and they did not want to repeat the same verb immediately after this. Paul not only tries to preserve the meaning of Old Testament faith; he is also conscious that his central message regarding justice by faith would founder if the argumentation of Rom. 4, Gal. 3, Rom. 9:33, and Rom. 10:11 should use the verb ""to believe"" in a sense different from that of the faith of the Old Testament. Deutero-Isaiah is, of course, as we might have supposed, the one who carries the Old Testament faith again to new hopes, with his staunch faith in the God who intervenes and who would definitely break into our human history to establish justice and life. But as Wiser quite accurately points out, ""The fact that most of the instances of the *he'min* refer to the relationship with God in the days of Moses...shows plainly enough the close connection between the special use of *he'min* and the sacral tradition from the very beginnings of Yahweh religion in Israel. 

If you're comfortable with that level of discourse and think your father would be as well, then go for it. If not, you're better off going with Miranda's earlier book *Communism and the Bible*, which actually is designed to be introductory."

They're prohibitively difficult to convene frequently and there's rarely a theological dispute important enough to justify it. The buck stops at the Holy See because, day-to-day, the buck has to stop somewhere. 

The history of the Schism isn't really the point here, either. Neither side of the schism disputed the primacy of the Pope, they simply disagreed as to what that actually meant. Same with the existence of sects that dispute the doctrine of infallibility; I only brought it up because your phrasing gave the wrong impression of what it actually means."
LeftCatholicism,fnlg4sj,t3_g22nz6,1587052959.0,"A couple of things need to be clarified here. 

First, the Pope doesn't *claim* infallibility. Infallibility is a note of his office as the supreme teacher of the Christian faith, and only applies to his solemn pronouncements that the faithful are obligated to believe in. This is not a power he has, it is a limitation placed on him by God because He refuses to allow His people to be led astray. 

Second, the organization of the Church is only as centralized as it needs to be. The notion that all power and authority radiates outward from the Pope has never been true. The Pope is supreme and primary among the bishops in the same way that Peter was supreme and primary among the disciples. This never manifested as unilateral authority even in those times and it certainly doesn't today. It should say something that the highest teaching authority in the Church is the Ecumenical Council, not the Pope. In the absence of one, the Pope has the last word, but not the only word. He doesn't exist to micromanage the faith, and I can't recall any Pope during my lifetime that approaches it that way.

Third, the Church's magisterium (which is its teaching authority, not a synonym for the hierarchy) authoritatively interprets the faith because someone has to. We've already seen what happens when it's decided that every person is an authority unto himself: every Bible basher who goes out to start a holy jumper church can say whatever he likes about Christianity with no one to answer to. This is why we have Peter Popoff making millions of dollars a year lying about his miraculous healing powers. This is why we have 37 different flavors of Baptist who differ primarily on someone's interpretation of some errant verse of the Bible. This is why creationism hasn't died despite its inherent ridiculousness. This was a problem even when the apostles were around; we have episodes of Acts where Peter and Paul have to go correct some fraud. After all, it's not as if Christ just left and said ""you all can figure this out yourselves."" He called a specific set of Apostles to teach for a reason, and that's what they did. Someone has to call these theological debates in someone's favor when they progress to the point where they cannot be reconciled.

Now, with all of that said, it is completely reasonable to criticize the hierarchy, and the spiritual style that is represented by Eastern Orthodoxy exists in the Catholic Church in the Eastern Rites. The Church is meant to teach us, not lord over us, a lesson that the Church has had to re-learn after its culture of secrecy has been actively and systematically harming people. But it needs to be properly understood before it can be criticized effectively, which is something that gets lost in the shuffle."

>Despite its flaws, we should keep in mind what Thomson was *trying* to do with the violinist analogy. Our views about fractious moral issues tend to be clouded by self interest, inertia, a lack of empathy, defensiveness, and caricature. By forcing us to consider a situation that in some ways had nothing to with abortion, Thomson was trying to dispel some of these clouds, enabling us to see things as they really are.

In other words, the violinist analogy was never meant to be a *defense* of abortion at all. It was meant to create a situation in which one would have to evaluate the moral issues at play without resorting to intellectual shortcuts or appealing to biases. And Wiland admits that even his analogy isn't directly comparable to abortion that results from consensual sex, even though it does address the flaws of Butler's original analogy. But he concludes by saying that this doesn't actually matter, and what's really important is the power of the analogy to get you to look at a moral issue from a different perspective."
