Psychiatry,fqu3uh2,t3_gkiy6d,1589651500.0,"I didn’t read all the comments but as a staff member of a psych hospital and consumer of services personally, I prefer NPs. They tend to be more approachable and eager to share information. Doctors are uppity and not willing to take input from floor staff."
sociology,fpfd652,t3_gc5h00,1588567829.0,Also thinking about dating apps do other things influence swipes? Like level of empathy? Presence of certain colors in images? Certain objects?
sociology,fpfd1v6,t1_fpfasin,1588567732.0,"I was somewhat unclear so I understand. I guess with the dating app thing it’s kind of a half baked idea. I am curious if people who overtly say they are not racist show biases when swiping left or right on profiles. Like do certain races have a bias toward others? I don’t know if that makes more sense. I haven’t slept in like 3 days (shout out to bipolar disorder)!

On the third I forgot the important detail of the psych population. I work in an inpatient psychiatric crisis unit and they are making a change at some point were patients clothes will be taken away and they will be given a set of scrubs to wear. I think about Goffman’s work in total institutions and stripping of identities so I am curious. I wish I could survey patients at work now and then later after they are implemented but I know that’s not ethical and I would get flack from management for speaking up against their great plan."
sociology,fpa5gkw,t3_gc5h00,1588441195.0,"Cultural tendencies on dating apps. Like do people have biases that don’t show up in everyday life but do to no one knowing come up. 

Also continued research on the impact of media on stigma of mental illness. 

And impact of patient “uniforms” versus street clothes in the inpatient population. 

And a thousand other things I question daily."
BipolarReddit,fp8sbgf,t1_fp8evwc,1588401355.0,I was in this situation my senior year. My professors were really understanding. One of my professors told me taking the final and not taking it would be essentially the same. I would have been able to raise my grade a little most likely but it wasn’t worth the stress. As for my final thesis for one of my majors I just did a fuck it sorta thing and turned in what I had just so I could be done with it. I get upset with myself sometimes because I got a D I think and I never had grades below a C but in the end it didn’t matter and I got my degree. Sometimes I get angry thinking I could have graduated with magna cum laude but it’s those times I have to be gentle with myself and recognize I was going through a lot of shit and playing with a handicap.
BipolarReddit,fny3eu1,t3_g4hbew,1587352450.0,"I worked a turnaround double last night into today. A “normal/rational” person would have gone home and gotten as much sleep as they could in the 8 hours they had between shifts, but nope my (hypomanic?) brain said we absolutely NEEDED to go to Target. I told my self I needed a sleep aid and a vitamin and caffeine source for energy. Well I walked all around the store and a hundred dollars later I left. I still wasn’t satisfied so I went to Fresh Thyme and spent forever there. I also got food that I didn’t eat. I always buy food when my mood rockets because I know I’m supposed to but I forget to eat it. Eventually I got home and was able to sleep for maybe 2 hours. Back to being wired."
mentalillness,fnk3pke,t3_g24d8h,1587014056.0,How long have you worked there? If it’s a year you could get FMLA. Or do you have short term disability through your employer? Those things are probably the only reason I still have my job.
mentalillness,fnk39y0,t3_g24d8h,1587013699.0,"It’s bullshit. I’m in Indiana and we are an at will employment state, which basically means they can fire you for any reason. Like they can’t fire you for having a disability but they could fire me for not meeting the duties of my job or any other bullshit reason they can come up with."
mentalillness,fnjtlja,t3_g24d8h,1587006694.0,At my job they were also aware of my mental health issues and still put on my evaluation that I was too emotional. Like I was in and out of the hospital and I thought it was low that they would put that on there and use it as a tick against my raise.
BipolarReddit,fngsl83,t3_g1kt9m,1586943403.0,Well I’m still awake. I know this isn’t a great plan but I need to do things beside lay in bed. I washed some dishes tonight that have been piling up since like February so that is good.
BipolarReddit,fmah27e,t3_fu0nbd,1585893889.0,"From what I know of working in a psych hospital you are unlikely to get med prescriptions from the ER, so I would steer clear. I would tell you to call your doctor or try primary care and see if they can call them in or are offering telehealth. I’ve been seeing my therapist and pdoc that way since this all started."
LifeProTips,fmadcu9,t3_ftxqmy,1585890526.0,I feel like a vigilante. Thanks for the idea! I just reported someone for putting an 8oz bottle on there for 40 dollars plus 6 in shipping. I work at a psych hospital and I love my job but honestly I’m scared.
BipolarReddit,flnwdq7,t3_fpsuz4,1585327140.0,I’m in the same boat. I’ve been off a week due to a fever. I have to go back today and I’m really anxious. I thought I would be fine at first but now that it’s actually here I’m really nervous. The worst part is I work at a hospital.
Anxiety,flmplyg,t1_flmpiub,1585291516.0,"Unfortunately I’ve used all my FMLA for the year when I went to residential treatment for mental illness. I have asthma, high blood pressure, and insulin resistance but they are all pretty mild."
Wellthatsucks,fljde9i,t3_fp0joa,1585207804.0,You may check out Gethuman.com for tips specifically for Capital One. There’s also dialahuman.com. Also an app I’ve never tried but it’s called DoNotPay and it has a function to let a robot be on hold and when it gets to a person they connect you.
IsItBullshit,fkac8pq,t3_fh8o9l,1584001295.0,When I was a young child I wanted to invite my cousin over for pizza. Well her dad was a firefighter. I wanted to ask him if she could come over while he was at work. Kid logic told me to call 911 since that’s who you call to get a firefighter. I don’t remember how my parents reacted but we still get a laugh out of it to this day.

CompulsiveSkinPicking,fjg3zdy,t3_fd3848,1583310429.0,I’m not an expert but I would guess it has to do with how much impact the behavior has on your life and how much it distresses you.

mentalhealth,ffyxx62,t3_evt602,1580357978.0,I work in a psych facility and they should be able to emergency detain this person. The law where I am is danger to self or others OR GRAVELY DISABLED. I would say this person meets the criteria. If the doctors there won’t do anything ask for a psych consult or go to another hospital for a second opinion. Your town may also have what’s called a “Crisis Intervention Team” which is a police officer who has extra mental health training and can make that person go for an assessment.
