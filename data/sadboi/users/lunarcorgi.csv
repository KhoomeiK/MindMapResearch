SkincareAddiction,fqar79b,t3_ghh8yc,1589223876.0,"your skin is really beautiful and smooth aside from the little spots of acne. from experience that looks like deep hormonal acne, especially if you are consistently getting breakouts in the same area daily.

everyone on this sub loves skincare and wants to help, but it’s always helpful to defer to a dermatologist for assistance as well!"
SkincareAddiction,fqaqcxc,t3_ghrh9r,1589223460.0,"Hey there. I went through a similar journey to you — persistent acne, multiple types of treatment including multiple rounds of doxycycline. good for short term, but not great for your health long-term. I didn’t go on accutane until I was 22, and I wish I had started it years sooner when my dermatologist had recommended. It saved me from the horrible cystic acne, and now the only acne I get is hormonal. I think if you feel your acne is affecting your self-esteem, accutane is absolutely worth it. If your doctor is recommending it, I think it is an opinion you should consider. A typical duration should be about 6-8 months, and then you should be done."

CPTSD,fnwfyxy,t3_g424pz,1587317651.0,"Oh, honey. I wish I could give you a hug. I am so sorry he put you through such an ordeal. You deserved to have had normal sleepovers where you didn’t have to worry about your dad’s behavior. You deserved to just be able to play and spend time with your friend when you were a child, and not have to worry about being a protector. You deserved to be a child. You have such a resilient soul, and you were wise beyond your years even at that age. 

I’m sure you were loved by your friend, and she had happy memories with you. Sometimes the support and friendships we share can transcend anything verbal, as we are connected by experiences."

CPTSD,fmr7k8x,t3_fwq57u,1586315745.0,"Yeah, if I even detect a glimmer of pride or approval I get overwhelmed and tearful, because I don’t know how to handle it. I know I should be happy but it’s so unexpected to me that I feel shocked and confused."
ptsd,fmr7c3t,t3_fwqvkv,1586315590.0,"I have CPTSD and have felt very calm during quarantine. It almost feels like a break from my anxiety. I feel safe at home. I feel safe in public because it’s no longer considered impolite to keep my distance from strangers and walk the other direction if I see them. I feel comfortable and secure and happy to be home with my pets all day, and relieved I can work remotely. I’m grateful for what I have. For the first time in years, I haven’t been nervously picking at my fingers or biting my nails. My hands and nails look so healthy, and I feel a sense of calm. 

It is strange because everyone else is panicking about the serious danger and instability going on in the world, but I guess to me everything always seemed dangerous and unstable. So everyone having to take a step back and exert more caution has made me feel much safer, and I enjoy being outside a lot more."

CPTSD,f8zkpol,t3_e30y1b,1574961815.0,"I’m so happy for you. :) I share the same experiences as you do, and while the holidays can be very difficult, I do find them to be easier as time goes by. Reading your story today helped validate that I am not the only one who has gone through these experiences and deals with the emotional pain long after the fact. I am proud that you went no contact and are now finding peace on your own terms. Lots of love sent your way, and know you have so many other people in the world that support you and want you to be happy, even if we are strangers. Take care."
CPTSD,f6rq1rf,t1_f6rk8c3,1573115050.0,I totally agree! I feel bad for others who may go to her seeking trauma therapy since she was so visibly disturbed by it. Thank you for being so kind and advocating on my behalf.
CPTSD,f6rpxga,t1_f6rjw23,1573114867.0,"Omg thank you so much for your indignation on my behalf.  I’m also so confused by it. In the emails we exchanged I made it clear I had CPTSD, so she wasn’t blindsided. I’ve thought about emailing her about how unprofessional and insensitive she was but that just feels kinda mean and pointless and I don’t think she’d care about my feelings anyway."
CPTSD,f6rpmkz,t1_f6r5bdr,1573114407.0,You’re so brave! I hope to summon that strength in me like you did.
CPTSD,f6rpl1v,t1_f6rebpw,1573114341.0,Thank you so much for your support! I’m happy and proud that you stuck through it and found a therapist equipped to help you. I hope I will be the same!
CPTSD,f6rpiy4,t1_f6rckw0,1573114254.0,"I’m proud of you for gathering the strength to be resilient in finding a therapist who works well with you! I do feel a sense of rejection, but you make a good point that it’s better it ended now rather than face disappointment later. Thank you so much for your kind words."
CPTSD,f6rp395,t1_f6r4sp3,1573113610.0,"Your old roommate sounds like such an empathetic and thoughtful person. :) This therapist did indeed email me a link to a different practice’s website, but there were many therapists there and said I would have to check with them because she didn’t know their schedules or availability. Tbh I don’t know if I trust her judgement and even her referral seemed like she couldn’t be bothered."
CPTSD,f6rosi1,t1_f6r4621,1573113175.0,"Thank you for your kind words. I will try in the future to try again with a different therapist, this just hurt my drive to try to heal a little bit and I’m hesitant."
CPTSD,f6roq1q,t1_f6r441e,1573113077.0,"She emailed me a link to a different practice’s website, but not to any specific therapist. Thank you for being kind and thoughtful."
CPTSD,f6r3jae,t1_f6r3fc9,1573092799.0,I’m so happy that worked out for you!
plantclinic,f3pc1nb,t1_f3oznkg,1571054224.0,"It lasted all summer long with really beautiful blue blooms, but the past month the heat seemed to wilt the flowers despite watering daily.  I’m a newbie but thank you for your feedback. I’ll try moving my plants inside next time the heat seems to be too much for them."
