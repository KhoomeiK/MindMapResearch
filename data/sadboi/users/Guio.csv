Hypoglycemia,fqwdvpc,t3_glaonh,1589700951.0,"I'm a guy in my mid 30's and I can relate a little.  Been Hypoglycemic my entire life (runs in the family, no diabetics), no gallbladder since 2011, etc.


I was officially diagnosed in my teens, and blacked-out right at the end of the 4-5 hour glucose test.


I've been to a lot of Endos in the past decade due to my hypothyroidism and they don't really seem to know jack about it. They usually just tell me to change my diet, which I have done several times, with no success.


Everyone's different though, but for me, any of the following can help trigger it: anxiety/panic attack, adrenaline rush, hot weather (+80F), any physical activity, etc...  Sometimes I just get it for no reason whatsoever.  It's pretty frustrating tbh.  Sadly, it does get worse with age heh.


It's good to rant from time to time.  Hypoglycemia just sucks heh."
