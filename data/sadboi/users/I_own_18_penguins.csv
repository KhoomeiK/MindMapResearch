AnorexiaRecovery,foj8srn,t3_g7o6xv,1587812897.0,"That sounds really fkn tough! I got badly addicted ti my ongoing project of starving myself and I understand what you're saying. What has helped me overcome my addiction was a very objective goal that I had to get to. I'm not sure if this will help you or not, but I'll just share my experience in case it does. Basically there is a really difficult hike I want to undertake toward the end of this year, and I was told by the eating disorder clinic that I had to increase my weight by 6 kilos before they allowed me to go. I was forced to pick between this big goal I had, and a continuation of my hunger, and I chose the hike. This is possibly really difficult to replicate with an exercise addiction? But it seems like your addiction is kind of imprisoning you. If you can set yourself a goal where you, maybe, free up a certain amount of hours a week from taking time out of your workout schedule, or go a day without working out. Maybe grant yourself 3 days straight without aching muscles. I also recommend asking somebody to support you? Like a doctor or a therapist or something. Battling something within you with noone to help can be incredibly isolating.

Anyway, I hope you're supported, and I wish you luck!"
