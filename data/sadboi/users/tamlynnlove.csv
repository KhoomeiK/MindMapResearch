relationship_advice,exx1jby,t3_cumwha,1566628576.0,"Oh, OP! I've been there,  it is THE hardest thing I ever dealt and still struggle with about 7 years later. When I was 19, (26 F now) I was in a relationship with a guy who was perfect, I loved him, gave him everything he wanted (sexual wise, affection, etc) but still he was never happy (physically and mentally abusive). Found out through snooping (and some girl he confided in that I was sure was the one he was sleeping with) that no, he in fact was a frequent flyer on Grindr and many other gay hookup sites. I stayed through the relationship, trying my very best to not let him know I knew anything. After a huge fight with his father I walked away but it still haunts me. Haunts my current relationship, how was he able to get away with this behind my back in such a small town? Turns out everyone knew, just didn't say anything to me. After I left, I got tested and had to get the police to tell him to leave me alone but long story short - this is not your fault, I didn't say anything to him after I left about what I knew. I hope things work out in your favor, sorry to take the light away from your situation but this is the first post I've come across that is alike to my past. Stay strong OP, it's not easy to let this go but you can and will be a better person after."
