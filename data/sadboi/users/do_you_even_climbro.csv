Overwatch,fr6c7wr,t3_gmwb7p,1589923644.0,"That's probably my favorite nerf spot. I throw it a bit more over the side room, so it's completely blind to them, but they couldn't have done anything against this anyways. GJ."
Fallout,fr5ynsr,t3_gabhia,1589916871.0,"Dude I LOVE you for posting this. Yes, I'm a Detroiter, but I've thought long and hard about this and I truly don't think there is another city out there that would fit the Fallout theme more. Sure, one day it would be cool to see a New York Wasteland, but I don't think Bethesda can ever go that way until they are completely ready for a MASSIVE-scale game beyond anything FO4 or FO76 has accomplished with scale.  


Detroit just fits Fallout perfectly. The art style, the music, the manufactories which could be used for autos, chems, guns, ammo, power armor, robots, etc. from the Fallout universe. Canada being directly across the water would allow for direct insight into their perspective of the storyline.  


The environment also offers amazing concepts for world-building. The factories were already mentioned, but we also have the salt mines deep deep beneath the city. We have sporting stadiums, we have interstates galore. We have the Ambassador bridge and the tunnel, we have casinos, the eastern market, etc. We have the GM Tower, we have Ann Arbor as the tech-themed ""suburb"" we have downriver as the ""free states"" bumpkin types (also the Fermi power plant downriver). We have the inner city as the organized crime faction, and again across the river could have a Canadian remnants faction of sorts. I saw post earlier talking about a pirate faction on the Great Lakes and that is simply an AMAZING idea in addition with all of this.  


New monster types would be great as well; They could do a rad wolverine, rad moose on the Canadian side, rad fishes of some kind in the Detroit river.... how about some rad Sandhills/Herons/Cranes! Rad fish flies. Rad June bugs.  


I don't know if my hopes and faith are just exceptionally high, but I really do feel that Fallout 5 might be based in Detroit. I just have a feeling Bethesda is secretly seeing what a spectacular setting it would be."

Then peaceful Taliban dude is executed and his son and the bad Taliban guys decide to take Max somewhere else, but oh no wait we're just going to kill Max next to this truck?

None of that makes any sense, it contradicts itself, it's bad writing and a waste of time.

Why didn't they kill Max and broadcast it like they seemed to intend? If they didn't want to do that why not just kill him in the compound instead of bringing him to a truck for zero reason?
