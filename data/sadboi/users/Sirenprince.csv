They’re just trying to play the game and survive? “Genrushing” isn’t a thing because that’s the main objective. Survivors can be toxic, like tbagging, flashlight clicking, but how can they be “sweaty”? I think killers invented that after being called “sweaty killers”. Killers can be toxic as hell too, and yes there are “invisible rules” like “don’t camp” and “don’t tunnel” but you really shouldn’t do that because it makes the game completely unfun for the other side and you wouldn’t like it if it happened to you, aside from actually receiving lower scores and points for camping and actually getting punished by tunneling with BT and DS.

Another thing, I've been playing since release, and ever since I built my campsite, nobody's ever gone to visit it besides the first obligatory villager. And now that I have 10, WILL anyone come to my campsite? What happens if I want to invite them to my town?

I am SICK and tired of Brita bragging about how famous she is and how many people know her in New York, like please, shut up. Brita should have gone home the moment she stood in front of Rock in the lipsync like 50 times. Everytime Brita talks I just want to mute the video.

Brita for the 100th time (in this untucked): ""I don't think I should have been in the bottom"". Me: \*lisa simpson looking down at plate meme\*

When Jan said ""You're entertainer of the year in New York City"" to Brita, and Sherry Pie said ""I think you're using that as an excuse"" to Brita, I SCREAMED.

Aiden really sorta gave up during that lipsync. I love Frozen and I love Let It Go so either way it was a magical performance for me. Wish Aiden stayed instead of Brita but oh well.
