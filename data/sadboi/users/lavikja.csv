This person won’t accept that they were actually wrong even if they end up apologising and you rekindle your friendship. They will likely just do it again when you’re not available to help them. 

They are being totally awful to you in every single aspect of your conversation. They aren’t concerned for your poor health. They want to intentionally sabotage your relationship. They put down your religion and beliefs. That isn’t a good friend. You can pray for them and wish them the best, but don’t allow someone like that back in your life to use up your energy and increase your stress levels. If they genuinely change for the better, they won’t do things like that."

If he is stubborn, it probably means he doesn’t want to be with you. I’m sorry, but I would suggest praying again with a more open mind and ask God to truly help you understand what is going on here because it clearly doesn’t make complete sense in the situation otherwise you would likely be hitting it off by now. 

If the man you love is hurt, his heart doesn’t need softening, he needs healing and no one else can provide that for him other than God and himself. 

I am not trying to hurt you by saying this, but I’ve experienced hurting myself by chasing men who didn’t love me back. It doesn’t help you or him, it creates even more distance, embarrassment and hurt on both sides. Ask God to help you understand what he is really calling you to find, is it love or is it something else?

There’s a paragraph in one of their books. It goes something like this, “Children often ask a lot of questions and when you give them an answer, they still ask, ‘But why?’ Jehovah wants us to be like little children and never stop asking questions, never stop seeking answers.”

exjw,fo5ah1w,t1_fo4yscm,1587521064.0,"They tend to make a statement and then choose a verse that fits that statement. However, the Bible has a lot of substance to it. You can’t pick a verse and turn it into what you think it means and leave it at that.

To truly understand the context or a verse, some books of the Bible have to be read in their entirety or sometimes there is an answer in another book somewhere. 

What makes it hard to argue with JW bible passages, is you have to be someone who is good at retaining information. So knowing good portions of the bible almost by heart to be able to refute some of their ideas, it’s too much for the average person to pull off.

I’m not even sure if they read the bible in detail or if they just read the scriptures assigned to them because otherwise they’d understand context a bit more.

Also, there bible has some strange changes to it. Like saying the Word was a god, instead of the Word was God. That’s how they explain that Jesus, (being the word) isn’t God, even though nearly every other bible says he is. And they don’t understand why people don’t like their bible?

I totally agree. Someone was basically telling me I was too naive to believe these “strangers” were being genuine with me, and I was like after half a year of seeing them weekly, can you blame me? I don’t trust strangers with my life, but I’m going to let down some walls after that amount of time and try not to believe that everyone is out to get me. That’s no way to live.

As an outsider, their meetings look really static and boring. I observed two, one on Sunday and one on Tuesday. Everything was pre written, even the “answers” to their questions during their “discussions.” 

Everyone just follows the set order like robots until they reached the end. I wouldn’t be surprised if some of them feel washed out after 2+ hours of “studying” twice a week, which I’m sure is much more in their personal times as well. 

Kind of reminds me of school, doing exams. It felt like a lot of the time, I had to memorise answers to questions, full paragraphs etc. If you were off by a few words or sentences, your grade was low or failed.

exjw,fo54iyk,t1_fo3tdqz,1587517339.0,"Just an example, could be a small profile like, “Lives in unit 4, Generic Road. Female, single. Drives blue Ford, has a dog.” This all differs with how much information you give, so then, it could also be something like, “Goes to Saint Mary’s Catholic Church. Works as a nurse, night shift.”

It’s far fetched, but imagine some psycho picks that up of the road and sees single woman, lives alone, she’s a night shifter, drives this particular car,. These are just small details someone could easily let slip without much thought, some could just be observations. If it looks like no one is ever home with you and you don’t wear a wedding ring, then they’d likely assume you live alone. 

It’s very unlikely to happen, of course, but it’s not like they are locking these books away in a safe and sometimes you misplace your phone at a coffee shop, same with anything else."

I’ve heard the name of that book a few times. I’ll add it to my Goodreads list. I love reading books about cults and religious perspectives. Probably will still even read JW literature, just not with them haha.

I feel so sorry for them. The organisation seems so controlling, so brainwashing. I wish them the absolute best. I know our exchanges will probably end here, but I don’t hold it against them personally and I understand where they were coming from.

No, I saw these people two-three times a week for six months and got to know them. They are not some people I spoke to for half an hour. 

My point was I thought our conversations were normal friendly interactions, instead I am doubtful as to what was natural and what wasn’t. 

What point are you trying to prove here? That I’m so naive and you’re obviously so life experienced and know better than I do about the exchanges I’ve had? I literally don’t believe that I’m being naive or cynical, I’m having a natural human response.

They have actually agreed to chat with me this week over some of the things I disagree with.

I understand discussing key things, like “What to say when someone makes x point” etc, but it was really strange seeing people act out a start to finish conversation, from hello to goodbye. Someone mentioned robotic and that’s really how it looked. 

I’m sure they are still good people, but as someone who is already shy and somewhat distrustful, makes me feel even more sceptical as to what was a real emotion and what wasn’t."

They had disclosed to me that they felt like we were “becoming good friends” and I was never overly personal with them, but I still felt a friendly connection to them.

So excuse me for being so cynical in feeling a bit upset that our exchanges felt rehearsed. I understand that job interviews and speech’s are polished, but I felt, given the nature of our conversations, that it was more than that.

AskReddit,fngoilu,t3_g1jljr,1586939144.0,"I had a speech problem as a child because I had some underdevelopment with my throat and mouth as a child which was fixed through surgeries. Then I had to have speech therapy. I was bullied a lot because I couldn’t talk properly until I was around 10 years old and even then, my voice was funny.

I’m in my early twenties now and my voice is completely normal. I bumped into this guy I went to school with and straight after he said hello to me, no “How have you been?” or anything, just “Were you deaf when you were at school?”

And I was like, “Noooo... why? *silence* I had a problem with my voice-“

Cuts me off, “Oh, cause I just thought you were dumb because you were deaf.”

I just walked away and never gave him another look. Even if I was deaf, how could I suddenly not be? And why would that make me dumb? It was just so mind blowingly ignorant and rude. 

Another story, I have kind of pointy canines like vampire teeth, except they aren’t *that* pointy anymore. My face kind of grew into them if that makes sense and they look reasonably fine now. I used to be really really self conscious about them as a teenager, wouldn’t even smile with my teeth. 

Now that they look much better as I’ve aged and I’m less self conscious, I don’t care so much, but if someone brings it up then I start doubting that they actually do look okay. 

So, it was Christmas like two years ago and there was this dude at the family’s house who I had no idea who he was. He ended up sitting next to me on the couch and I was having a conversation with someone about something I can’t remember and he just blurted out, “Are you ever going to fix that?” 

And I was like, “What?” Dumbfounded as to what he was evening talking about and he just pointed to his tooth.

I said no, and he asked me why I wouldn’t fix it and I just simply stated I didn’t feel the need to. Went back to my conversation and he butted in *again* saying I should fix it. Ended up sitting by someone else. 

****

And another story for anyone who has even read this far, I saw this homeless guy and his dog sitting on the ground by a supermarket, so I went in and bought him some groceries. When I gave it to him, my boyfriend walked up to us briefly and said some nice things to the guy and then went to the ATM, minding his own business. I was about to leave and the guy stopped me and said, “He’s not abusing you, is he? Is he hitting you?” I said no, I’m fine. And quickly walked away and he shouted out to me to, “Be careful, Little Lady!”

I was shocked, like wtf right? My partner and I later came to the conclusion that he was probably racist."

How do they know whether a man or a woman lives at a house, though? Do they watch the neighbours to find out? One time I was visited by both a man and a woman, but majority of times (in different cities) I’ve been visited by only women."

At the end of the day, I have to remind myself that even though I feel somewhat close to them, they would never be friends with someone who isn’t in their religion. (I assume, anyway.)"

exjw,flzriav,t1_flzoiqi,1585631339.0,"Was she ever diagnosed? Could have been Schizophrenia, could have been something else. I think it’s important to keep an open mind in that not everyone with certain symptoms fall into the same condition and it could possibly be that or something else entirely. 

I appreciate your empathy towards her either way. It’s very troubling to witness other people truly suffering, especially when it doesn’t make sense. Schizophrenia is confusing, it doesn’t make sense and that’s why it’s so poorly represented or preconceived. 

I feel that my reply above was quite aggressive to OP and I didn’t mean to be so defensive. I was just hurt. I fully accept that people can have the more stereotypical delusions and hallucinations that often come with Schizophrenia. I, too, have experienced them. I just don’t agree with how these people are represented and the lack of empathy people share with them as opposed to someone living with a less stigmatised illness like anxiety. 

Not to undermine anxiety in any way. It’s just almost like a fashion statement to some people to claim they have certain illnesses that they do not, but as soon as someone says, “I am Schizophrenic, I have hallucinations and delusions,” the response tends to be an uncomfortable one and of someone who isn’t even willing to try to understand. It’s just very frustrating. 

I can appreciate where this post is coming from. I now know OP didn’t have ill intent to single out Schizophrenics. It’s just so misconceived that sometimes I want to tear my hair out and scream. 

Thank YOU for being empathetic towards people struggling with more out the box symptoms, though. I appreciate your empathy with the woman you described."
exjw,flzkz2j,t3_frumyh,1585626230.0,"I understand where this post is coming from, but it’s just really hard for me to digest. I am actually Schizophrenic and I constantly see people relating what they think is “crazy” as being “pretty much schizophrenic.” It’s really hurtful to people with Schizophrenia and I, in no way believe JW’s are right, but I don’t think comparing their religion to “basically schizophrenia” is a fair comparison at all.

I hate my mental illness, I fucking hate it. And everywhere I look, I see people stigmatising it and making us look like the crazies who want to do outrageous, outlandish shit all the time and we can’t possibly live normal lives. Media portrays this mental illness as if everyone who has Schizophrenia is convinced the government is monitoring their brain or having fantasies of murdering their families, or believing they are the reincarnation of Jesus, but it’s never portrayed accurately. As a result, we get posts like this with people using phrases like, “They are basically crazy, like people with Schizophrenia” or “They are soooo Schizo.” 

Also, people being religious or apart of a cult, doesn’t in any way compare to being Schizophrenic and suffering scary, horrifying, depressing hallucinations and delusions. These things are horrible to live through, they are draining, they are burdens, they are fucking unexplainable to describe to someone who doesn’t have Schizophrenia. Having a belief in God and doctrine, is not even comparable to living through the horrific experiences we have to go through nearly every day or week or month of our lives.

I know the hurt is unintentional, I know people will think I am over reacting, I know OP didn’t mean to make me feel this way, but I hate being compared to and classified as crazy. I hate that other schizophrenics are classified as crazy. I also hate the, “Crazy people don’t know they are crazy” stereotype, most of us are aware we have Schizophrenia and we are also aware of how most people think of us. 

We are not crazy and I wish people could see it for what it was in the same way they feel for people suffering with depression and anxiety. 

Everyone is so ready to promote not stigmatising depression, anxiety, suicide etc (which most Schizophrenics struggle with btw as a result of being Schizophrenic), but when it comes to Schizophrenia, people are just ready to throw us all under the bus."

JehovahsWitnesses,fl27fc7,t3_fluxjd,1584744621.0,"I read one of their books recently and I can't remember it's exact quote, but it said something along the lines of not priortising a church, organisation or denomination over Jehovah. But when you observe them from afar, they do exactly that.

They are slaves to their organisation. All the rules. All the things they have to follow and participate in. Multiple meetings that they are expected to attend each week. The amount of literature they are meant to read (which after reading a decent amount myself these last few months, is literally the same regurgitated lines over and over again), only confining their readings to JW.org. The list goes on.

And they have the nerve to say Christians who wear a cross on their neck are committing idolatry."
