I would also recommend keeping a diary.
First of all, you will have a reference for everything you ve done because panicked brain has crappy memory.
Second, it would be good to write down all your feelings so you can review later. For example was I more scares, what triggered, how I felt later. Etx.
Third, it will be a good achievement tracker. After N amount of exposures you will feel good about yourself and that ""you are still alive""!
