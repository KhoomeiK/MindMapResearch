Also, I wear my chacos basically anytime it's not snowing, so with no toe I can also wear socks. also sometimes I'll wear socks with my chacos while hiking to prevent any rubbing/blisters/rocks/sharp plants from hurting/cutting my feet.

CampAndHikeMichigan,f1cnpkx,t1_f1c28od,1569361470.0,"> I have indeed been to Leelaneau SP. I have camped there but spend more time doing small day hikes here. I really enjoy this park for many reasons: sites on the water, awesome, scenic, pretty decently, easy hiking trails (you have to drive to these as they aren't attached to the campground), and just generally love the peninsula a lot. It holds a special place in my heart since my fiances family has a small cabin within a few miles of the park. You are really close to some awesome cities. Northport has an awesome little bakery, a brewery that is fun to hang out at, and is just a really wonderful area. I also enjoy running my dog in the off months at the Woosley Field Airport. Even if I didn't have a dog, I would highly recommend checking this spot out. Beautiful in the fall! I also love that you are close to Suttons Bay and Leland (fish town! make sure you go to The Cheese Shanty for one of the best sandwiches you will have in your life). This is indeed a wonderful area to see in the fall. Went a week or so earlier last fall and really enjoyed driving along M-22's curves and hills, listening to some awesome jams, and taking in the scenery.

Hey horsedd! Thanks so much for your thorough response. It seems likely that we will head up to leelanau based on your glowing recommendation! I may DM you in the future about camping in the UP. Unfortunately being in med school in Detroit, it's hard to find time to get up to the UP. The two trips I have done up there though (early winter backpacking in Taq & end to end on Isle Royale were nothing short of incredible!).  I do hope to do the entire lakeshore trail up in pictured rocks whenever I can find a chunk of time when the weather is nice! Thanks for your thoroguh response!!"

running,f0k3t84,t3_d50u8j,1568669614.0,"I understand where you're coming from asking the questions '""is it even running if you're going that slow"" and ""shouldn't fat people desire to lose weight."" 

I think beliefs of ""running that slow isn't running"" can potentially alienate people from doing something that is they enjoy doing. Who cares about defining a set speed for running vs. walking, everyone is running their own race (pun intended), let them do their thing.

""Fat people should desire to lose weight."" I honestly think weight is a very personal thing. As someone who is not overweight and has never been overweight, I can't relate to being overweight or obese. But from the research I have seen it is very, very hard to go from being obese to having a normal BMI. This is the your body physically not letting you do that. 

Fat shaming is real problem in the USA and whatever we can do to remove that shame and let people live their lives instead of being treated so poorly or ashamed to do whatever makes them happy, the better.

&#x200B;

Side note 1: there are plenty of people who have normal BMIs, but are metabolically unhealthy (e.g. dyslipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes). So weight isn't the best proxy for someone's health, although those who are obese more often than not do have a lot of other diseases. 

Side note 2: I do worry that movements like Health at Every Size might move the needle to far in the other direction of people thinking that every weight is ok. I do like that this movement and things like the fat running movement help remove the shame in being overweight, but personal weight goals are a very personal thing and it is really, really difficult to lose weight and keep it off long term when u are obese. Shame prevents people from taking steps to get help and from doing things they love. no one wins."
NorthCountryTrail,eztbkxp,t3_d1yto2,1568126396.0,"Hey - hiker from the LP of Michigan as well (metro detroit, more specifically). I think this is totally possible for you. 

You will spend countless hours researching gear/routes/drop offs/sections where the trail is less developed/etc. Do that. The more prepared you are, the better.

You will need tons of mental stamina going that far especially on the drab less interesting days, but from your post, it seems like you have it.

What I think is most important is getting your body ready. Start getting some miles under your belt. Wherever you live in the LP, find a park with trails near by you and get walking. You can also crosstrain with running or other aerobic activity if you don't have the luxury of time while you are setting up for your long hike. Starting with just an hour or two a day of walking, but ramp it up to running or more miles. Once you get a pack, load it up, and try walking with it at your local park fully loaded to make sure it is adjusted and fitted correctly. Ramp up miles in a consistent way. Don't go balls to the wall from the get go - your knees and ankle are what are likely most prone to be injured, and soft tissue injuries often aren't super fast to heal so the smartest thing you can do is to avoid them in the first place. 

Also, if I was in your shoes I would consider just doing the UP section of the trail - IMO a lot more gorgeous from what I have seen. but again, seems like that's not a huge motivator for u"

Running is a tool in your tool belt. It's never too hard to dust off and use if you need to, but just as happy laying dormant. for me my athletic focuses have turning more towards hiking, rock climbing, and biking. what really brings me joy is adventure, and at one point that was running, but I have found that adventure elsewhere too. You are leaving marathon running behind, but remember you can find the parts you like elsewhere.

&#x200B;

about progress. your story has a very linear story arc. from a mere quarter mile to a marathon. What has helped me change my mindset is injury. After really unstable shoulders over the past 10 years and knee pains over the past year or so, I'm relishing in just being able to rock climb and run. Yes my fastest mile was 9 years ago. don't know if I'll ever beat. but for me, running and other athletic endeavors provide me so much more than just external validation that I am getting better and more skilled at something. When you leave running alone for a few months, and try it for the first time in a while, you'll remember all of the things u missed. you'll enjoy the mental relaxation and escape from the hardships of ur daily life. you'll enjoy the feeling of exhaustion. you'll enjoy the rhythm of ur feet.

Michigan,ep24l1x,t1_ep21bla,1559001787.0,"question for ya - how many total hour of hiking was it for you? 

the tldr is that for the weekends this summer, I could get to the trail by 7pm friday, but would have to be back at the trailhead by 9am sunday. I am trying to figure out if this is a recipe for an unpleasant death march, or something that is totally reasonable"
Michigan,ep20yz0,t3_btrddr,1559000030.0,was JUST looking into doing this trail earlier today. thanks for sharing!
