Looked it up after hearing that, and turns out it's a symptom of that disease; although, the symptoms can be temporary from what I've read.

(conventional) Religion, though is simply not a rational belief, for it is based on believing in a book written by humans that has also been mistranslated countless times throughout the centuries.

LeopardsAteMyFace,foyclhq,t1_fowuyik,1588170038.0,"Oh absolutely. They don't even think. I've seen someone up in the positives for a good while instantly go into the negatives once a dissenting opinion that goes into the positives is commented. Hive mind, sheeple, whatever you wanna call em... It's a real phenomenon. Really depressing"
houston,fowqnno,t1_foveg0q,1588125105.0,I heard of this type of thing so many times. Animals. Humans. No one is safe from shit luck and even shittier humans. This planet is loathsome
LeopardsAteMyFace,fownbgn,t1_fovvs6w,1588123188.0,"Notice how you're getting downvotes, but not any good answers? These people don't even understand what you're talking about, missing the point completely. They think we're defending Trump's stupidity just because we're explaining something to them that is LITERALLY TRUE. There's a much better way to handle this that doesn't involve lying. Lying like this just makes them more similar to those whom they despise.

What's so difficult about saying 'Trump's foolish words have seemingly caused people to consume toxic chemicals.'? That's a true statement which includes no lies (as far as I know). Why make things up? I just don't get it"
LeopardsAteMyFace,fowm374,t1_fovwm7k,1588122471.0,"I said the same thing. Spreading lies by saying someone explicitly said something they didn't say just brings those who spread said lies closer to his insane supporters. I told the truth and was reasonable about it, but now I have the most downvoted comment in this thread lol. It seems many of the people in this sub are more like those they condemn than they want to believe. It's truly depressing when you're chastised for being completely rational"
LeopardsAteMyFace,fotndf7,t1_fotmnyj,1588059446.0,"Bingo. I'm glad you understand. I can only hope that all those who downvoted me can understand at some point, too"
LeopardsAteMyFace,fotlofb,t1_fotkepb,1588057830.0,"I get what you mean. I'm just trying to convey the fact that it's better to say what literally happened for the sake of accuracy as well as not giving his side more ammo to continue their ignorant rampaging. Know what I mean?

I know they'll still do their thing, but it's just one more small victory against ignorance the way I see it. In the sense that they can't say stuff like 'SEE? they're trying to make shit up about daddy! Just further proof that everyone's a stupid lib spreading lies!' etc etc about this particular instance (and hopefully all future instances). It probably sounds like I'm taking this more seriously than I should, but I'm just trying to explain what I'm going on about and why I believe it's pretty important"
LeopardsAteMyFace,fotjv7j,t1_fotivsf,1588056173.0,"Well, yeah, of course it's important to get the details right when discussing anything. Otherwise, it's just rumor spreading and intellectual dishonesty. That kind of thing should never be normalized and always called out or we're doing the same thing the crazy far-right Trump fanatics do.

I agree with you 100% that he was a moron to even suggest it and people are stupid enough to do it anyway, but it's not semantics. It is literally misinformation. It's just an area in which humanity should strive to be better in. Especially for the sake of them not becoming what they hate. 

I genuinely just want people to be better. There's so much crazy out there, and I'm not down with living in the kind of world where logic, reason, understanding and honesty is a rarity"
antinatalism,foti976,t3_g99738,1588054744.0,Every single thing going on in the world right now has been bringing SO much stupid out of the woodwork. At least some people are bringing some sanity to that thread
LeopardsAteMyFace,foti1jt,t1_fothqtv,1588054558.0,"Typo. Meant to say possibility. It's still stupid as hell to say, but it's not the same as saying he's suggesting people do it themselves. Pretty obvious difference. No shit it's bad for you lol. What? Am I not being clear with the point I'm making?"
CasualConversation,fothdsn,t1_forg7s3,1588053986.0,Yeah... Anyone willingly having children at this period in time is being extremely irresponsible
LeopardsAteMyFace,fotgwp2,t3_g9dq60,1588053581.0,"Didn't he just suggest to a scientist/ doctor the possibility of putting disinfectant into the body (and light lmao...) rather than actually suggesting people actually ingest/ inject themselves with it? As much as I dislike the extreme idiocy that is him, I hate the spreading of misinformation and think people need to do better than believing and spreading false info. I'm open to evidence"
JustBootThings,fot3ng7,t1_for6sbe,1588043914.0,Laughing my shit out\*. It's a common tactic to get the stuck poops out of you. Just get a big ol giggle fit going and the poop pops right out
TooAfraidToAsk,fot351s,t1_fot1w6o,1588043592.0,"Absolutely. Many people love to preach the old adage- ""Facts don't care about your feelings"", but most don't seem to have the same view when it comes down to the things they don't want to be true"
TooAfraidToAsk,fot1gp4,t1_fot08lm,1588042539.0,"Yep. It's the basis of Antinatalism. No one can choose their luck or what horrible things may happen to them as a helpless, innocent child, so why risk it? It's just cruel and incredibly sad"
TooAfraidToAsk,foszumc,t1_foqwkp9,1588041548.0,"Precisely. Who are they to force someone to remain extremely miserable. It really is a shitty situation for all involved, though"
ptsd,foqbvq2,t3_g8y4jf,1587989599.0,"Before PTSD, I had sleep paralysis a couple of times, but without any of the fear and scary shit typically associated with it. I liked it, because it was an interesting experience. Now I get it time to time, but it is always associated with nightmares and paranoia"
kratom,foqbnfy,t1_foqabng,1587989409.0,"Have you seen the rest of Reddit? Not sure where you go, but that's just not true for any generally active sub"
theevilwithin,foojggz,t3_g88tiw,1587940173.0,"I swear, it's like 80% of JP horror games have to include the whole 'girl from the ring' black-hair-covering-the-face trope"
JusticeServed,fon44h2,t1_fomywab,1587911790.0,"You're talking to, possibly, the stupidest person in this thread. You can be perfectly reasonable with them and they will never get it. This person can't even apply their own devil's advocate to the other side. They saw a Reddit post and instantly believed 100% of it with no context or information"
JusticeServed,fon3agn,t1_fon0ybj,1587911236.0,"Another comment near the top stated that the last time this was posted, it was revealed that these people were splashing water on innocent people and behaving aggressively towards them. If this is the case, many of these people are defending the assholes while thinking they're correct just because a Reddit post said so... Humans are incredibly gullible.

It's exhausting trying to be reasonable with dumb butts. Literally none of these people appear to know what happened in this situation, but are pretending they do because, apparently, a title and a 46 second video with zero other context can convince them they know everything"
Nioh,foknlv8,t1_foka41p,1587845447.0,"So apparently, if you move, it also helps pick them up faster, but that's all I've noticed. Whenever I pick something up from a body while standing still, it takes a second after the item falls on the floor before the game lets me pick it up. If I'm guarding, I can get it instantly"
