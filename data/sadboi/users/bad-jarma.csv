Anxiety,fdtoz65,t3_emztj1,1578719974.0,"My therapist suggested doing something that’ll distract me instead of trying to do breathing exercises. Sometimes breathing exercises turned into a longer panic attack than necessary because I just could not get my breathing under control. So now I try to do something distracting. Sing loudly, dance, ive recently started a painting class and painting has been the most successful thing I’ve found. 

She also suggested standing on one leg and lifting the opposite arm. It helps cause it gets both sides of the brain to communicate so it cuts off the amygdala.

Also try some yogi kava stress relief tea!!

I hope you feel better soon!!! Panic attacks suck and I know they take up a lot of our lives on this subreddit, but they pass. This one will pass and you’ll be stronger than ever!"

It’s legit jasmin, none of the added sweetness, laundry-like, or other weirdness that comes with some other jasmin fragrances. It does have a slight Smoke to it but I think it smells more like incense than cigs.

Gucci bloom is also really good but it’s very very strong. I wish I could tolerate it because it smells amazing.

Also, I hear flying fox by lush is a good jasmine but I haven’t personally smelt it myself yet. I just bought it because I’m also on the hunt for the purest jasmine. I’ll let you know!"

I hope you are getting many sausage McMuffins and I hope you are proud of what I am trying to do now. Your job was done and you are missed greatly. I hope to see you again in the future.

I assume u aren’t a dog abuser since u r posting and asking if it’s too tight out of what I presume isa safety concern. We have one pup that’s smaller and calm, and then we have a bigger dog who we simply can’t control when he sees another dog. He has a prong collar that mostly works (he still gets too excited, and if anyone tries to say something like “oh that’s abusive”, well okay I’ll just let him go then the f???). Anyways from the angle it looks okay. The way I tell is if it’s loose when he’s not pulling and can tighten then it’s good. Good luck and happy training."

It will hurt for a long time. What helped me was getting little tommy (that was his name) everything. I got stickers, photo magnets, portraits, even a tattoo. It helps me too see him still, even if it’s just in pictures. I like to have his image close by because it reminds me of everything he taught me.

It’s okay to totally breakdown but eventually your pup is gonna want to see you being who they loved again. I like to think that dogs leave when they think they taught us what they needed to. 

It’s a terrible thing to love something death can touch. I wish you all the happiness in the world and I’m so sorry you are going through this. One day you will be able to remember your fur baby and smile and not cry I promise."

But I had one, his name was tommy and he was the GOAT, I didn’t realize too much but looking back at pics his face started drooping. He died of brain cancer, which is common for boxers. 
I don’t wanna scare you, but if you are willing to look into that before it gets to the point of no return and it won’t interfere with his quality of life too much than it might be something to look into.

If he’s sneezing more than usual, or pressing his head than it could very well be a tumor.
