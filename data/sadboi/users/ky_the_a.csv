mentalhealth,fqp213a,t1_fqp1lfi,1589532206.0,I actually don't know what my relationship with myself is like. I never really thought about it before. I'm glad you found home in yourself. I hope I can someday.
mentalhealth,fqol2fe,t1_fqlngsn,1589517775.0,I agree. I hope I find someone who is home to me soon.
mentalhealth,fqokzel,t1_fqm0hin,1589517716.0,Same.
mentalhealth,fqobd29,t1_fqmkxks,1589511490.0,Thank you :)
mentalhealth,fqob62l,t1_fqm5iz9,1589511372.0,I still live with my parents since I'm a teenager. I think I get this feeling because I don't feel like there's a place where I can be surrounded by people and let them know what I'm really feeling.
mentalhealth,fqo18m6,t1_fqm5sc6,1589505500.0,I feel like home would be a place where I could never have a mental breakdown. But I honestly don't know if there could ever be a place like that. Or maybe home is a person. Not sure.
mentalhealth,fqo05fe,t1_fqm3nri,1589504865.0,I hope you find your home someday.
mentalhealth,fqnztqa,t1_fqlm65m,1589504675.0,It's good to know I'm not alone. Thanks
