EDAnonymous,foecml9,t1_foeb46z,1587700635.0,"Thank you for this comment. 28 and at my sickest, although I feel it still doesn’t show. Left treatment too soon. 
It’s good to know there’s hope on the other side."
EDAnonymous,fj1jf8d,t3_favb06,1582921331.0,YES
EDAnonymous,fh4dyot,t3_f1agnq,1581277757.0,I’m in treatment rn for the first time and this is very comforting to see. Thank you
fuckeatingdisorders,ffq0rf4,t3_eufmer,1580114130.0,"This thread is so uplifting to read. Been sick for 10+ years and flirting with the idea of recovery for a long time. Now my long term relationship is in turmoil and I feel no other viable option but to either recover or die. I’ve completely isolated myself and cut myself off from people and things that give my life real meaning. And it’s so hard to imagine life without this illness. I feel like I never will be sick/thin enough. I’m terrified. 
Thanks to all of you for being so inspiring."
EdAnonymousAdults,ff8dtqo,t3_es46ps,1579674329.0,"I relate to this so much. I just turned 28 and have been sick for over a decade. I have been flirting with the option of treatment for years but after descending into a pretty bad relapse this past year, I plan to make recovery a reality. Even though the other half of me doesn’t really feel worthy of it or want it because I’m still not thin enough. I still feel like I need to lose more weight in order to warrant getting treatment, even though I’m underweight right now and feel tired, dissociated and weak all of the time. 
Anyway, I’m sorry you’re in this position and are not receiving the mental support you need. It’s not your fault. I really empathize with feeling guilty, it’s so hard not to feel it. I feel like it’s part and parcel with this disease. 
Sending you love."

bisexualadults,fe6xzpd,t3_enuat5,1578907592.0,"I’m in this exact situation but we have been together for 5 1/2 years and live together with our dog. It’s a shitty situation to be in when the person you’re with is the best person you’ve ever met and will always love and have some parts of your life forever intertwined with. But to yearn to be with a woman so frequently is something I can’t keep ignoring (even though I want to). 
It’s nice to know I’m not alone in this, because it feels hella lonely!"

EDAnonymous,fc6uj54,t1_fc5fk9k,1577489851.0,"I’m in this exact position right now. Everything feels so impossible and my partner is only making it worse by telling me we won’t have enough money for rent if I stop working and do treatment next month and that I need to help him by figuring out how to get income support. 
The whole thing just makes me not want to recover and I feel awful and like everything is my fault"
EdAnonymousAdults,fc3h5j2,t3_efyto5,1577389696.0,"Ugh sorry you had to endure that. Mine was ok, I’m relieved it’s over but my disorder still wedged it’s way in between everything. I hadn’t planned on purging but I still did, like a couple hours after dinner bc I couldn’t digest it and couldn’t stand the feeling of fullness any longer. 
I have a really bad head cold from my immune system being low and I know that’s my own fault. As soon as I got out of the bathroom my mom was like “did you throw up?” 
Like WTF. I said “no” and gave her a weird look. She was aware of my head cold but I wasn’t sick from flu or anything so it seemed strange that she would ask that. 
You’d think if she was actually concerned she wouldn’t say it so nonchalantly. 
One more Christmas dinner left and then it’ll be over. Sending everyone love! We can get through this."
raisedbyborderlines,fc28rog,t3_efo8r3,1577345876.0,Best book ever. Didn’t have time to read it fast enough before having to bring it back to the library! Gotta get a copy one of these days.
EdAnonymousAdults,fbnivkf,t1_fbmoi3u,1576998478.0,Yeah it’s weird and I’ve been using behaviours to numb out since bc I’m sick of feeling things. I want to say he means well and that he treats me more like a confidante than anything and I should probably set more boundaries or something. Im so tired. Will likely delete this post soon as well. Thanks.
EdAnonymousAdults,fb9yhhf,t1_fb99jaz,1576655283.0,This is me. I relate so hard.

EdAnonymousAdults,fan3pym,t1_fak5lc2,1576222554.0,I remember this point in my life a few years ago (pre-actual adult responsibilities) and I decided not to go to treatment. I really regret it now. Please go if you can! You deserve it.
EdAnonymousAdults,fan3ngt,t1_fajwacr,1576222466.0,Wow. I have almost every single one of these symptoms. And I know the longer I let this go on the harder it will be in the long run and I should have gone to treatment years ago. Fear and denial and not feeling “sick enough” wreak such havoc on one’s overall cognition. Thanks for the encouragement.
EdAnonymousAdults,fan3eco,t3_e9knfl,1576222156.0,"Wow, thank you all so much for responding and being so kind and encouraging. I know that if I don’t choose recovery eventually, I will die. And while I want to stay alive for my partner and my dog, it’s also just so hard to truly care about it sometimes. Life is so exhausting. I appreciate you all so much. ❤️"

Dogtraining,f6edv3b,t3_dqvrmk,1572802982.0,"Thanks for all the encouragement folks! And yes I’ve brought him to many training classes already, the breeder we got him from is a dog trainer and we see her frequently. 
It is a matter of being consistent myself, which can be difficult. And of course working on my patience. I hope it will improve as he gets older."
raisedbyborderlines,f5qoeif,t3_dorl26,1572380348.0,"After 6 months going NC with her I reconnected with her, sat down and explained why I had to go no contact, how painful yet necessary it was, and set some boundaries with her. She listened, seemed understanding and somewhat sympathetic. There were a lot of tears. She said “I don’t know how to be a mom or a friend. But I want to learn how.” It felt healing and hopeful in the moment. 
Fast forward 5 months later and we aren’t speaking again due to her manipulation, guilt and mind fuckery. She still treats me like a child, calls me “baby”, tries to invade my space any way she can. (I’ve also regressed w my boundaries bc it’s almost impossible not to if I want to have her in my life in any capacity, which I feel really guilty and like a failure for.) I’m also the eldest and only daughter so she really punishes me a lot and treats me differently than my brothers. 
My brother is setting boundaries with her today and I sent him this thread to read. Sometimes it just feels like it’s all a lost cause and I’m sick of feeling depressed and at a loss all bc I can’t have the mother I need. It’s tiring and I feel like I’m too old for this. 
Thank you for this thread!"
EdAnonymousAdults,f54ix09,t3_dmkixv,1571984190.0,"I feel the exact same way! I haven’t even spoken about my ed to my parents in years, let alone can relate to having parents actually take interest in my declining health. In my mid-late twenties rn and life is so lonely living with ED and not having anyone really notice or care. Nice to come to this community and feel less alone!"

mentalillness,ezytwn3,t3_d2ry3e,1568274585.0,"In a toxic relationship with the mirror. It seduces and controls my every waking moment. Always searching for the skeleton underneath my skin. I can’t remember a time when I wasn’t trying to disappear.
Always sad. Trying to control the sadness. Tired from smiling. Making plans then immediately dreading having to go through with them. Cancelling them. Sleeping too much. Sleeping too little. Over caffeinated. Unmotivated. 
Less is more and more is less. Scared of people. Endlessly exhausted. Desperate to appear lively and lovely. Deviating from the path to reality."
