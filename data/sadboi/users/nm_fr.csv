BPD,fp030ms,t1_fozx3zd,1588201536.0,"No, I don’t either. Relate with a lot of the stuff in the post but not that. If anything, I’m a little bit too honest. Which is why I over share and sometimes dehumanise people and forget they have feelings when I want to express that they’ve hurt or upset me"

Whether you love or you hate them, this album was their peak. Lyrically, thematically and production-wise far superior to any of their other work. Just a brilliant album and their most polished work to date."

and thank you so much for the offer but honestly we have sooooo many, we’ve got enough for another mood board like this one, possibly even two, and then enough to make a ‘family tree’ with a mix of Baby Bella cards and their parents’ original cards 😅 this quarantine has made us binge buy far too many so I need to stop myself for now!"

MarinaAndTheDiamonds,fhkxmsv,t1_fgt2sni,1581693036.0,Alone but with a live band! Preferred the Neon Nature tour so much compared to L&F because it had the rather bad dancing instead of live music. Prerecorded music didn’t pack as big a punch either

acne,fbsw0ve,t1_fbst6l8,1577061732.0,"That’s really interesting that your body has such a specific response, and great that it’s worked for you! I was only going by what research is out there at the moment and like I say, there hasn’t been enough evidence to suggest a direct link between diet and acne so when people automatically tell people to ‘quit dairy’ or ‘quit sugar’ I think it can be quite misleading, unless of course a medical professional has told you to as in your case :)"
acne,fbr1z6d,t1_fbqja0n,1577038186.0,"Hi, sorry to jump into this conversation. I’m from the UK too and the NHS has specified that there has been no conclusive link found between diet and acne in studies so far, so it won’t be dairy :) read their page on acne on the NHS website to identify other myths that they’ve pointed out"

Suffered with cystic acne since I was about 15 (21 now) and the only time I have had completely clear skin is when I was off work for six weeks after fracturing my pelvis.

BPD,fbhwjqm,t1_fbhvqgh,1576884208.0,No worries! I hope you start to feel better when you see each other again. Also really glad I joined this subreddit to see that people experience the same things!
BPD,fbhvgh6,t3_edehvk,1576883375.0,"Hi - new to this thread :) this was one of the biggest barriers in my relationship last year when my boyfriend was living in halls at uni. I felt the same as you. I started to exclusively focus on all of the negatives in our relationship to the point that I wholeheartedly believed that I had no option but to end it. I found it impossible to remember why we were together in the first place and like you say - almost a post-break up bitterness and anger.
The only thing that got me through it, and even though it’s probably the last thing you want to do when you feel like this, is speak to him on the phone, as soon as you can. Hear his voice, talk to him and try to regain that sense of normality. It’s so easy to completely shut down and almost depersonalise and dehumanise him when you have that space and you’re not speaking or seeing each other. I don’t know much about your relationship but if your partner is aware of your condition, talk to him about it and tell him that this is what you’re experiencing and that you need some reassurance. 
Most importantly, remember that it will pass.

Edit : sorry, totally misread and thought you’d used a ‘he’ pronoun but you didn’t! Try and imagine my post with whichever pronoun you need haha"
