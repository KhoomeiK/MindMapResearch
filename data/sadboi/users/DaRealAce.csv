All the below content is from: (http://exiledonline.com/kill-without-joy-hit-man-praises-jack-ruby-as-strictly-pro/)

This is a quote from a 1970's book 1970s called “Kill Without Joy: The Complete How To Kill Book”

Written apparently by a Canadian locksmith. The hard-boiled title belies the book’s dark comic flair. Or maybe it’s just the war nerd in me that finds this book oddly mood-enhancing. It’s exactly what it says it is: A practical “How-To” manual on the many ways to kill a human being.

Whether or not Kill Without Joy is meant to be serious or parody or for the vast market of nerds who think they’ll someday become dark professional killers, it is an entertaining read and most of the information seems to make sense. He really went out of his way to catalogue everything from the obvious to the bizarre.

One passage that really stuck out, in the section on “how to assassinate,” was this description of Jack Ruby’s murder of Lee Harvey Oswald 48 years ago today. Remember, the author is apparently Canadian, from Ottawa:

*One of the best visual representations of an assassination that I’ve ever seen is the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby. Ruby was strictly pro in that photo showing him pumping bullets into Oswald. One should note that the left hand is drawing back the jacket and the gun has no sooner cleared leather than it starts shooting. The grip on the gun is also interesting and further backs the suspicion of Jack being a pro. He’s using his middle finger to squeeze the trigger and his index finger, the normal shooter’s trigger finger, is pointed right at his target. He shoots where he points. This method is not too well known in the States but the method was SOP with wartime SOE and SIS agents of Britain. Another method advocated by them was the stamping of the right foot and thereby lunging forward and firing at the same time two shots in rapid succession at each target that presented itself.*

I had never thought about this before because Ruby seemed like such a bizarre noir-dad from another era. Also the iconic photo of the shooting focuses on Oswald’s gasp, and the cop-escort’s recoil. But here is the larger photo that the author of “Kill Without Joy” is talking about, Ruby really is lunging forward and does, come to think of it, look plausibly more “pro” and less like someone’s deranged dad from this angle:

http://sdrl.com/pt.html

Please note the BOLD section - 

Methadone, administered daily at a steady dose, should be present in the blood in levels sufficient to maintain ""normalcy"" over a 24-hour period. That is, the patient should not feel drugged or ""high,"" or have withdrawal symptoms (abstinence syndrome) during that time.

Measuring levels of methadone in the blood-in terms of nanograms per milliliter or ng / mL - is helpful in determining how much of the medication is circulating in the patient's system. Typically, the blood level reaches a high point, or ""peak,"" about 3 to 4 hours after taking the dose. There is a gradual decline over the remainder of the 24-hour period to a low point or ""trough"" level.

Blood levels are interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical presentation; the lab values help in making dosing decisions when faced with challenging cases. The trough level at 24 hours should be at least 150 to 200 ng/mL, or 400 ng/mL to achieve cross-tolerance, thereby making ordinary doses of IV heroin ineffective. [1]

In practice, serum methadone levels are sometimes more helpful in confirming inadequate dose than in determining optimum dose. Clinicians Sarz Maxwell, MD and Marc Shinderman, MD recommend that a minimum of 400 ng/mL (trough level) is usually effective for alleviating objective signs and subjective symptoms of opioid abstinence syndrome. [2]

**The peak level at 3 to 4 hours should be no more than twice the trough level, giving an ideal peak/trough ratio of 2 or less. This rate-of-change ratio can be of more clinical value than the actual levels. A ratio of 3.5 would indicate rapid metabolism (early peaking) possibly leading to unexpected withdrawal symptoms, whereas 1.7 might suggest normal metabolism. A trough level alone, although useful, does not indicate the rate of change over the time-course of a dose.** [1]

Methadone peak, trough, and average levels and the rate of elimination (half-life) may be influenced by several factors: metabolism, poor absorption, changes in urinary pH, concomitant medications or drug abuse, diet, physical condition, pregnancy, even vitamins. [1,3,4] Research also shows that two equally occurring forms of the methadone molecule (enantiomers) in the medication-one active, the other inactive- are metabolized at unequal rates in some patients. The amount of active methadone can vary greatly between two patients at the same serum level; one will be comfortable while the other is not. [2,5] However, the clinical utility of this has not yet been established and testing for the ratio of active to inactive methadone in serum is not commonly available."

Measurement of the drug level in the bloodstream just before (trough) and just after it has been administered and metabolized (peak) helps the physician determine the appropriate dose, the appropriate frequency of the medication, and the patient’s tolerance of the treatment.

A “trough” is the lowest level of the drug in the patient’s blood stream, and is measured just before the next dose of medication is administered. The purpose of drawing a trough level is to make sure the amount of medication in the patient’s blood stream is still high enough to be therapeutic.

If it’s too low just prior to the next dose, the patient is not having the full benefit of the drug’s effect. The physician could respond in one of three ways: 1) increase the dosage so that it’s still at therapeutic levels just prior to the next dose; 2) decrease the time between dosages; 3) a combination of the two.  If the trough level remains too high prior to the next scheduled dose, it could indicate the patient’s body may not be able to adequately metabolize the medication. Administering the next dose too soon could push the medication to toxic levels, which could cause organ damage.

A “peak” is the highest level of the drug in the patient’s blood stream and is generally measured about 30 minutes after a dose of medication has completely infused. The purpose of drawing peak levels is to make sure the drug’s concentration is high enough to be effective in treating the patient’s illness, but not so high so as to be toxic. Physicians also order other tests to determine a patient’s tolerance of the treatment, such as electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, blood counts, platelets, and liver function panels. For some medications, there is a very fine line between what is considered an effective dose and a toxic dose."
