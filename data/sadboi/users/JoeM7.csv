He asked what is the use of the the hard problems that really make you need to apply the knowledge laterally. That's the question I answered. Though I think this extends beyond Math because creative problem solving in general is better than wrote learning. It sounds to me like that is what the problems he's talking about are trying to get at.

Weather or not he'd actually need that particular class or knowledge is another question, especially because if he isn't into math, he's going to swiftly forget that wrote learning. I definitely think schooling has its problems in those ways."

I can't speak to your teachers and I don't know you or your individual situation, but if you have a good teacher, they are not only going to teach you wrote techniques, but rather how to think about a problem and apply the things you learn to brand new problems. Yes these are hard, but they're supposed to be because that is how you build intuition for these things.

Just remember, a computer can do simple math better than you could ever hope to. The only thing you bring to the table as a human is creative problem solving techniques. Computers can only work in well defined spaces where there is a simple wrote method to solving a problem. Humans can delve into the unknown to apply old ideas to novel and interesting situations."

Some salts are soluble, reactions go to completetion, Lewis structures or even VESPR are fully accurate representations of molecules, all wrong, all oversimplifications, to varying degrees, to make intro to chem and gen chem accessible to students who are new to chemistry. But they are mostly correct. Correct enough to slide students to get a sence for chemistry without completely overwhelming them with it. There is a reason that we don't teach einstein's theories of relativity and quantum mechanics to intro to physics students.

The reason we call them insoluble is because they are mostly insoluble. If you add silver and chloride to a solution, you will see a solid mass of silver chloride form at the bottom, the precipitate. As opposed to if you added sodium and chloride to a solution, where it would fully dissolve and you would see no precipitate. Now with three silver chloride, or indeed all ""insoluble"" salts, there will be a tiny tiny amount still dissolved, but that is irrelevant at the moment and it really is an absolutely tiny ammount."

Even life and death cease to mean anything in the age of dark. The age of dark is the age of hollows, but what is life and death to hollows? They are one and the same.

I think that no matter what it is cyclic because the fading of the fire leads to an end to disparity which is as the world was when all was grey, before there was fire."
