AskMenAdvice,f7oxjs4,t1_f7orctl,1573936866.0,"Assuming the man has more to lose and/or has more assets simply because of his gender is just that, an assumption. And a fairly sexist assumption at that. But okay."

AskMenAdvice,f7o54j7,t3_dwuwte,1573921010.0,"Prenups are an easy thing to get for all of those who are worried about losing their assets. Marriage is nice for tax purposes in the U.S., and for some it's just nice to celebrate their love and committment with people in their lives. Doesn't have to be a whole big expensive ceremony/reception to do that (I'm against spending so much on one day just for show versus using all that money for life and travel!) But to each their own - the only thing that matters is whether you and your partner are on the same page about what you want to or don't want to do. Talk to him about :)"
AskMenAdvice,f7o46ms,t1_f7ln31j,1573920504.0,"You're assuming he's the one who has a better paying job simply because he's a man? Or that she doesn't value her assets as much because she is a woman? Or that a woman couldn't be at risk of losing custody or doesn't care about that as much? 

Women have equally just as much to lose.

That being said, a prenup is an easy thing to do. Those worries are not an excuse to not get married when there is such an easy preventative measure."

If the kids at home are not young, I don't see any reason why she shouldn't be working, or at least doing the chores. It could be depression and/or anxiety but it sounds like from one of your comments that she socializes a lot and has fun. Not that that means she's not depressed. But it could be that she's using you and is just lazy. It's not chauvinistic of you to advocate for yourself, and for her if she really does need help, and say you've had enough and express how unfair the situation is."

Inviting me to come with you to a fitness class or for a walk, that makes me feel like I'm actually wanted around and not being judged. But bluntly telling me what I already know and already agonize over doesn't help at all. It's more likely to have me spiral into obsessing over how overweight and worthless I am, so I'm back to just wanting to crawl into bed and never getting out. Because my depression is clinical and genetic and requires more than just one solution to combat it."
