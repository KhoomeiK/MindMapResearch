I’ve had this shit my whole life in various forms, derealization and other various bullshit. As one does, I sunk into the closest safety I could find, often unhealthy shit that became habitualized because the healthy way was damn near incomprehensible for a fucking kid. I’m 18 now, grateful I never truly tried to kill myself but still stuck facing the alternative. At age 16, I couldn’t take it anymore, so I made a Plan to break out. I think most who’ve been through this shit would be in some sort of agreement that breaking out of your shit is the literal embodiment of Hell. I worked tonight for New Years with some beautiful people who were making fun beautiful, too. I had no choice but to stand by and watch. My life has been a pure grind to get myself off sleeping on the train and into self care and goals, and with this one night of fun and possibility before my eyes, I had to turn and walk away into my gray. What’s the point of living if you can’t even have those beautiful things: the laughs, smiles, dancing, and chatter? If your only form of effective communication is a social defense mechanism designed for pure survival over happiness. It’s not just loneliness, it’s isolation. Isolation from beauty and a possibility I’m forced to call “eventual”, even if it’s right before my eyes. Separating myself from my dreams and my ideal self to go back to pain from morning to night, then through night too, just makes the living feel so not worth it. There is too much impossibility, no clear road from here to the day I walk up join the beauty. A journey around the (metaphorical) world and self just to be able to walk up and engage in life. Hell, if I told myself to be in hell for a few years why the fuck not go all the way. Is that not what torture victims ask for, the release of death if all of life feels like pain? They see themselves trapped, no clear road of escape, and their entire existence is designed for pain. I don’t mean to compare my experience to theirs, not getting political or anything, just drawing a simile. There are times when the glimmer of hope feels worth the fighting, the pure beauty of that ideal image, the times of motivation. It feels so stupid to make that your entire reason to live. This is why for New Years I ask for death. There is no life here, no matter how far I run.
Again I hope this is the right space for this and thank you for having it, whatever stage of life, Hell, or whatever in between you’re in, I value you because I believe in you. I don’t believe in you because I want you to feel better; I value you because I know, I believe, you are fighting for your motherfucking lives. You exist. If you’ve never tried to commit suicide, tried to take your life, or think you’re too pussy to kill yourself, it doesn’t make a fucking difference.
We are the Warriors of Hell."
