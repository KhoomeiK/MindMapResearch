SuicideWatch,f2tyvgw,t3_de53ht,1570403086.0,"Try to find out more, if she's comfortable talking of course. Why DOES she feel like this, is it school? Parents? Etc. Just show her support, as long as she isn't actively suicidal she shouldn't be in too much danger. Is she currently self harming? You need to find that out, and suggest different coping mechanisms. If she dosent want to tell your parents, suggest to her talking to a school counselor, that's what a lot of kids do, and if the counselors not available is there any adult she's willing to tell??

It's not a lot and I'm not a professional, but that's what I've been told to do. If she IS in danger you HAVE to tell your parents whether you guys like it or not it could save her life, you know better safe than sorry.

I hope your sister finds someone to talk to, and the best of luck :)"
