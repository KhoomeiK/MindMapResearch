He knew a guy from the town he lived in and my mother's hometown through a bowling group. He went every week and saw this guy. I wasn't born yet. It was about 1990. 

This guy was Gary Hall. He is connected with at LEAST 40 murders in Indiana alone (if I am remembering correctly) but he was a traveling Civil War reenactor through many states and his visits just so happen to match up with many disappearances.

He brutally kidnapped, assulted, raped, and killed many many women and girls. They all trended to look similar and he was known to stalk malls and convenience stores and also break into people's houses and take them.

He was a twin. He and his brother were bullied terribly as children because they were very small due to birth complications, they lived in a cemetery where their father was the caretaker, and they were all-around weird. His life story is really interesting if you care to look into it.

But the point is... In this tiny little town, Wabash, Indiana, known for its quaint old fashioned looks and absolutely nothing to do, my father met a serial killer."

I can't even begin to imagine sitting for 15 long agonizing minutes waiting to pick. I will stop whatever I'm in the middle of doing in order to pick. I've developed easy one-handed picking tactics and I will stop using my hands or just one of them and I still don't realize I'm doing it. Even waiting 5 minutes with the urge seems very unrealistic.

AskReddit,fizoogb,t1_fizmdm0,1582868988.0,"It stands for Dominant Daddy Little Girl. It is essentially a dominant person, male or female, who plays a care-taker role to a person of the same peer group. Not a child. This submissive person usually loves being taken care of and having a care-free, child-like mind set. They may identify to be a certain age mentally while they acknowledge being a physical adult. Many ages fall into this category. Anything under 15 usually is accepted. 

The things people know about this kink that are true is that the LG will sometimes call the DD ""daddy"". Other titles can include Master, Mommy, Mister, etc. 

There are many misconceptions. The DD is NOT attracted to children. If they are, they are a pedophile and would not want to have a physical relationship with an adult, no matter how immature their mind is. Another is that the LG lives as a child. Now, some do. I know of people who are ""lifestylers"" and live every day, all the time as a child mentally outside of work and public. But usually these people only act childish as a kind of break from every day life. They may have adult sized children's clothing, pacifiers or bottles, dolls, coloring books, diapers, whatever, but it is rare to find someone who lives their whole life like this.

I tried it for a few years, lifestyling that is, and it was fun. I enjoyed feeling free of worries for the most part and not having to act like an adult. For me it is a coping mechanism. But it is hard to keep up the act. It is much easier to be your adult self until you just naturally shift into a simpler mindset. I have a great partner who is willing to roll with the punches. Also, the same kind of sex every time is boring. Sometimes I want to change it up. Nowadays it's not a huge part of my life, but if anyone has questions I'm not a judgmental person and am willing to chat!"
