S9plus,fkic15c,t3_f651xl,1584216460.0,"I've bought it on launch and tbh I'm getting a bit bored of the old design but I can't quite afford or justify upgrading either. But it still works well enough even though I'm a relatively heavy user.

Some notes for you:

-As I've said, the (even though tiny) bezels look a bit dated compared to the newest tech. (It still looks futuristic compared to the iphones tho imo lol)

-Battery life is enough but not perfect, I usually end up needing to charge at the end of the day BUT it never died on me. Not even once in the past 2 years.

-It just got the Android 10 upgrade and it mostly works beautifully except some animations (like lockscreen wakeup) lagging etc. Keep in mind that this is most probably the last major update it will get.

  Other than these it's just an overall good and reliable flagship phone; decent camera, amazing screen, fast and wireless chargin, a headphone jack, etc.

 Have you checked the newer ...10 Lite versions though? If they are still more expensive than S9+ go for it but if not you might want to reconsider."
S9plus,fkib9gy,t1_fi46uhj,1584215947.0,"I think you should wait for the next 5G phone, S20 lineup seems a bit rushed and off on that part.

modernwarfare,fecu55b,t1_fectrm3,1578984721.0,Yeah me too! I really enjoyed the 4 times I could play in the PC beta and than couldn't find any matches later when I got the game lol

It was around %70 through the match I'm guessing. I played run and gun for the whole match and the scoreboard shows that. I was grinding for the camos and decided to mount on a wall for like 10 seconds. A random noob, named as youcamptoomuch or something, comes and shoots me while the rest of the team has been casually camping for whole the match.

1) You don't decide how people should play.

modernwarfare,f9qwvdv,t1_f9q6elg,1575568086.0,"Same here. But I recently tried it with Origin Access Basic cos it was so cheap and I was curious. Pacific maps feel a lot like the old BF (unlike BF1 and BFV vanilla maps) maps and the content is sufficient for a limited time playthrough.

You can search for developer options, it's a bit tricky to get in first time, you can speed up your window animations and do many more things. But be careful on what you click on in those settings.

Good Lock is a must to get the most out of customization. I held out too long to get into this, thinking it's some third party shady app but it's made by Samsung so it works like a charm.

Widgets are much more prominent and useful here than iOS, you need to find your own favourite though :)

These are what came to my mind at first glance. Enjoy your new found freedom and have fun!"
GalaxyS9,f49svbm,t1_f40mml2,1571482829.0,"I wasn't really aware of these issues with Google, you're absolutely right!

And Samsung had upped their game with design AND functionality, it's really amazing. I sometimes just remember the things Phone to Contacts switch being a total pain and now we are here having decent optimisation all around and even a more compelling design language than any other Android, it's amazing.

I also think Bixby has some decent features over Assistant (and definetely Siri) but it needs work and having a dedicated button for it is not really ideal imho. Also the Assistant seems more like a human. On the other hand, I personally would prefer Samsung to use their probably massive resources they spent on Bixby on something else."

But if I had the chance economically, I would be looking forward to the next Note honestly.

It does everything pretty well but for some reason couldn't excite me as much as my previous/other devices did since I got them, and I must say I got it on launch which may suggest I am getting bored of it (I know it sounds spoiled lol, just being honest). It's just efficient and handy, nothing more nothing less."
