I never said she can’t care about it, I said it doesn’t give her the right to react in that manner toward another human being. If anything is that important to you, you should have it saved elsewhere in case of an accident. Like this."
AmItheAsshole,fhtfy0e,t1_fhtejy0,1581874062.0,"“Smacking the shit” out of someone is definitely what I would classify as assault. Throwing a flip flop is still an inappropriate reaction to someone accidentally dropping a phone in a pool. If anything was so important that SIL had a meltdown over it being lost, she should have kept that information backed up elsewhere. 

If someone dropped my phone in a pool, I’d likely be disappointed, but in no way would jump to needing to express my feelings by way of throwing things, screaming, etc. Accidents happen and these things are just that: things. It’s not like someone threw my toddler into the bottom of the pool. Unless we’re missing info here and his wife took her phone, flipped her off and violently launched it into the pool, that type of reaction is out of line. The phone also still works and the data can likely be saved."

Your wife caused the damage, offered to pay to replace the phone, and your sister also wants that to be the end result. That’s solved. You refusing on your wife’s behalf is inappropriate, as she’s expressed what she wants to do about it.

Your sisters inappropriate reaction is another problem entirely, but it has nothing to do with the incident at hand. Only the future of your relationship. You can stand up for your wife while resolving the matter. Explain that you’re willing to replace the phone, but unwilling to have a relationship with someone who finds it appropriate to throw tantrums and objects at your wife when accidents occur."

Do you ask for wedding gifts back when one of the two is suddenly widowed? “Sorry, but seeing as you’re not cooking for two, can I have that back? Seems like a waste.”

Jesus H Christ. Who raised you? If you were that hard up for 50 dollars, why would you have agreed to donate at all?"
