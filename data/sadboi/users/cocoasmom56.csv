bipolar,fqymn4q,t3_gldnr6,1589751066.0,"My mania became very expensive, buying stuff I could not afford on credit then giving it all away. Why do credit card companies give high lines of credit to people on disability?! I'll never figure that one out. But I still cycle into bouts of hypomania where I start giving away my belongings thinking I can afford to replace them. I can't. TG my friends know what's happening and stop me. Being manic used to have short segments of fun and productivity but now I never know when or if I'll cross that fine line into psychosis. So I don't like the somewhat muted way I feel but it keeps me out of the danger zone. TG for the lack of sex drive as opposed to hypersexuality! That is way too hard to live with if you are 62 and single. So it's all a balancing act that fluxuates daily keeping us on our bi polar toes!!"
bipolar,fq9h5b0,t3_ghi0mo,1589198092.0,Also the jumping in and out of bed really upsets my little doggie.
bipolar,fq9h14j,t3_ghi0mo,1589197991.0,Me too. Found out those are not good times to make important decisions. Unless they can be undone and your peeps are really understanding.
bipolar,fq9gknw,t1_fq80ibr,1589197584.0,Reading your reply really made me laugh. I'm an outdated hippy chick. Hope all good things always come your way!
bipolar,fq7x8kd,t1_fp4s2en,1589154069.0,Oh no you so don't. I've taken enough meds to knock a buzzard off roadkill and having a brandy and still can't lay down. And i made fish chowder when most people would have been unconscious. I shouldn't have been handling sharp objects! ðŸ˜†
bipolar,fq7wio7,t3_gh55fr,1589153652.0,So true. Then you are like who was that fool and what the hell was he talking about? So outta there!
bipolar,fq60tgy,t3_gh0z1l,1589122094.0,Hope everyone gets their happiness back soon.
bipolar,fp3tpky,t3_gayeoc,1588285624.0,"OMG! After 2 haldol still going 100 miles an hour. I'm not so young anymore. Took a rock garden out of my apt. Lots of heavy rocks. Pulled down drapes. Moved furniture from br to lr. Somebody stop me!! I'm 63. I won't be able to move tomorrow. Oh, also cleaned floors and vacuumed. Looks awesome though!"
bipolar,fnmbm1o,t3_g287mh,1587068504.0,Or when that jagged pill slowly and painfully works its way down your throat. Arg.
bipolar,fnbfvid,t3_g0hl53,1586814807.0,I'm doing ok. The way I look at it is I'm glad I was already on meds before this happened bc I wonder how many people are getting mentally ill because of it and sure can't get help right now. I know it's a warped way of thinking. And I so feel for those of you who are struggling. I'm kind of a home body so not getting out isn't too bad. But I really miss my family and hugging my friends. I'm grateful when I can sleep cuz that's always an issue. I get paranoid and I kind of feel that creeping up on me. I'll be glad when all this is over for everybody's sake. Hang in there. Peace and love!
bipolar,fn4hhtm,t3_fyopvw,1586641490.0,"I had some really weird psychotic episodes. The feds were always involved and knowing everything I was doing. But God had me on a mission. Of course it didn't make sense and if I acted on it I don't remember because I have long blackouts when psychotic, anyone else do that? Anyway that said just grateful my meds put a stop to my psycocic. Hearing music all the damn time and people talking in the next room gets old. Peace."

bipolar,fluk0z6,t3_fr7op0,1585504159.0,I agree. I now live in a restricted stay at home state. I can't watch the news anymore bc it's making me paranoid! Just feel mentally unstable and am trying to keep it together. Had quit smoking on 2 14 and bought a pack yesterday. Damn. This is stressful!! Up and down all night. I guess we all need to hang tough together!!!
