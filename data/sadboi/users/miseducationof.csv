It could be cultural too since she‚Äôs expected to act more ‚Äúmature‚Äù as she gets older. Just my opinion and not a fact.

Edit: I have NO PROBLEM with her age at all. It‚Äôs the fact that her personality changed and it may have to do with the fact that she can‚Äôt act the same for over 10 years. We‚Äôve never seen those ladies on a show for 10 years straight."

abuse,fqo6w5b,t3_gjse15,1589508800.0,"So I‚Äôve worked as a social worker before and unfortunately, many cases get closed because there isn‚Äôt enough evidence for the courts. Your friend‚Äôs best bet would definitely be to have a recording of some kind - whether he hits the voice memo to record on his phone any time he is around his step-dad, or like you mentioned, setting up a camera. A voice recording is better than nothing but if you really want to help him, maybe help him with paying for and setting up a camera. There are many cameras and such that sell on Amazon for about $20. 

Also, police reports are very important. He must report this to the police and if he has physical marks, he needs to take photo/video of them and save them in his emails; etc so it doesn‚Äôt get lost. Tbh, if there‚Äôs enough evidence, the step dad will go to jail and can most likely be sued as well. One more thing, you can also call CPS to support your friend. Every single victim is logged onto the system including the number of calls. Therefore, CPS will have a harder time ignoring this case."

AskAstrologers,fptc5ft,t1_fprz0vo,1588888567.0,">Its hard for Scorpio to let go, your emotional self tends hold onto pain because letting go feels like a betrayal of your past, because the kid in you who got hurt deserves to have his pain respected. Plus, the 12th house revolves a lot around self sacrifice, so it's kind of easy to let yourself go in that aspect, the speech being ""It's fair and just if I suffer in order to give enough space for the pain in me thrive"". While a Leo-Moon in the 12th would ""self-sacrifice"" it's ego, a Scorpio tends to offer pain and trauma.

That's exactly how I feel - that I'm getting justice for my inner child. I feel like I've been suffering and self-sacrificing my whole life due to the traumas.  


>Holding onto pain is unhealthy, of course and it's a struggle for all us, it's just that Scorpio has a harder time letting go. If I may offer some advice, try to learn from the strengths of the sign opposite side of the chart, Taurus. Through taurian qualities Scorpio can balance itself. Make an effort to find some time to exercise your body, eat well and rest. Look for people that make you feel comfortable. This may sound generic but I promise that can help you feel better and stronger.

Thanks for that tip - I never thought about looking at my sister sign to find a balance. Thanks for your insightful advice as well."
