Change the why, the what stops having so much power. Having said that, it becomes a vicious cycle which is why addiction kills so many people and ruins so many people’s lives."

If you have set a goal to withhold from any form of sex, then I suppose you need to decide if the juice is worth the squeeze, if you'll pardon the expression.

One thing to consider - people handle trauma in myriad ways, up to and including hijacking other people's stories. It is certainly possible that she is a pathological liar or attention-seeking, but trauma is often in the history of people who seek attention or lie pathologically. As you know, rape (in addition to being a crime) is a deeply personally traumatic experience, and it's possible that your roommate has her own story that is too painful to tell. But in answer to your question about what kind of person steals a rape story? Well, one type of person is a trauma-survivor like you. I suppose it's possible that she's just an awful person, but the fact is that so many people have horrid histories that you never know what kind of monsters they are battling.
