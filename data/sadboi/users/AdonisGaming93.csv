EliteDangerous,fqo5lux,t1_fqo4637,1589508043.0,"At the end it's just comparing the debt at which you decommission vs the cost of voluntary. If voluntary saves you a little bit of money then yeah voluntary decommission. If I know I'm leaving for a long time, then I would set a reminder on my phone or just do it right there on the spot. 

The thing is if they were to say that fine no upkeep but if you don't play for 40 weeks straight your carrier is gone. You could also be in the situation where you say ""hey I know I'll be back by then so I'll leave it running for friends to use etc"" and you end up coming back week 41 and lose it. Meanwhile an upkeep system allows people to prep this and say ah okay so I'm gonna be gone for X amount of time. Let's make sure I have enough in the bank.

Upkeep allows you to be more flexible with it. If it is just a set timer then that timer can't be circumvented. If it is upkeep you can circumvent it by getting enough credits for a long time of upkeep, decommissioning early if you think you won't make it back in time. Plus you still get money back. 250mil lost is really not that big a deal. 

This makes you do math. At 250mil loss that's 50 weeks worth of upkeep not 40. So you have to ask if you are gone for 40 weeks. It actually SAVES you money by getting together enough credits to pay for the minimum upkeep rather than decommissioning. Also it isn't 792M upkeep. The core is 5mil/week. In the end it takes math to actually calculate what would be a better option. 
I hate upkeep but actually mathematically it gives more options than just a timer. Plus without upkeep is eliminates the point of actually managing a fleet carrier by specializing it for certain tasks instead of just throwing every option on it and done. It makes fleet carriers a more dynamic thing to manage.

Yes fleet carriers are end game and require a little more planning....but if you are this into the game then that's not unexpected. Go on other MMOs in end game guild activities they are pretty much run like clockwork with weekly activities etc. If you want a mobile station that will take planning.

I know my jedi guardian is gonna turn."
halo,fqn2jsm,t1_fqmzd7d,1589487592.0,"Kbm isn't playing against autoaim though. 
Controllers do not have auto aim. We have to be careful when using terminology. Yea it has an amount of aim magnetism and an amount of bullet magnetism. That is what we can adjust to fair levels. 

Also I would disagree with ""this is what we want in Halo"". Yes of course if you are better at aiming you should win. But it isn't just a game about slaying and aim like twitch shooters. Halo is also about map placement, knowing the powerups, setups. Communication so you have two guns on each opponent, managing enemy spawns etc. 

For me what I would not like to see is controllers get unplayable to the point that a team with really good communication and map sense is losing to a team that doesn't even know what a map callout is just because they are on controller and opponents are on kbm. 

With zero magnetism controllers are unplayable no matter what platform you play on. Doesn't matter if it's consoles, pc, or whatever you want to think of. A thumbstick needs a little help.

The question is well how much help? 

Imo Halo CE on PC i play with controller and I still do fine in games.

I also think that once Halo 3 drops we are gonna see a change, because Halo 3 isn't hitscan BR so it matters whether the controller player can lead his shots well. A kbm player I'm sure will be far better at tracking to correct for bullet travel which should make it much more balanced.

I know from playing eldewrito that a good kbm player will destroy a controller player, while a good controller player will beat a medium to unskilled kbm player so I think from my experience the eldewrito assist was pretty good.

If you ask me the only game where you really NEED to use only kbm are games where you have 30+ abilities or menus etc like MMOrpgs. 

But games where you really only have a handful of controls I don't think it's unfair to ask that we incorporate different input methods so the game is accessible for many. I still think that a professional team of people on kbm with really good aim will destroy controller players."
EliteDangerous,fqmhs7c,t1_fqlx8qz,1589477664.0,The amount you lose is barely anything. Easily gotten back itself really not a big deal.
halo,fqm98uc,t1_fql53eg,1589473647.0,"Yeah. Hopefully once this is fully released or when halo infinite drops 343 will be making adjustments. I'm a controller player so I would prefer controllers to remain viable, but it needs to be tweaked to make it more fair for sure."
halo,fqm8zx9,t1_fqlc762,1589473529.0,"Of course kbm should at least be on par with controller. I didn't say it's balanced as it stands now. My opinion though is we shouldn't get rid of controllers aids all together and instead find a balance that makes both viable but not overpowred.

Edit: SHOULDN'T get rid of controller aid all together. Yes have some balanced amount"
halo,fql3jua,t1_fqjg844,1589445007.0,"Input matchmaking isn't the issue. The issue is people outright wanting to tell people ""too bad pc master race play kbm or go cry"" when there's hundreds of games on pc played primarily on controllers like rpgs. 

Also consoles are inferior. Steam does not exist for consoles. You dont3 get steam sales or mod support etc. Telling people who prefer a controller to just go pkay console is excluding them fro. Everything else PCs do. 

Plus PC don't really have one single primary input method. That's like saying the  we can't allow mouses with different buttons because it gives an advantage over people who only have two buttons on their mice. But we don't. 

The issue is finding the right amount of assist for controller to make them competitively VIABLE but not overpowered. 

Which is very difficult and someone will always complain.

Right now H2 is probably skewed too much to controller. But reach for example was actually not that bad so maybe they can edit H2A to be closer to how reach was."
halo,fql39h7,t1_fql0b8h,1589444726.0,"a really good kbm player will still beat a controller player. If you aren't consistently 4shoting then you aren't as good at kbm as you think you are. Cause I can absolutely guarantee you controller players even with assists are not 4shotting consistently. I know because I don't and I still lead my team despite missing shots frequently. But i have good map sense, decision making, and movement in Halo from having played it for over a decade. And yeah. I miss shots literally all the time having to 5 shot or even 6 shot sometimes.

So if you really are good and can 4shot consistently on kbm you would still defeat average controller players almost every single time."
halo,fql303c,t1_fqiazyp,1589444471.0,"Yeah but that's not how it works. Try playing skyrim on pc with kbm and controller and you tell me which feels more immersive or fun. I can't even control my walking speed on a kb. This is the issue with PC master race thing that excludes ppl. I don't want to keep buying a console. Steam is a godsend but if I prefer controller I would like to be able to use it not be shut out of playing a game because I have to conform. I can't aim for shit with a mouse. Never have been able to nomatter how much ive tried. 

Halo doesn't have to get rid of controller assists it just has to  balance it right so that battles are won based on game sense, map positioning and communication. 

Heck look at rocket league. Both inputs are used and viable game has a great competitive scene. It's about manking it balanced not removing options all together."
halo,fql2oma,t1_fqk0r3s,1589444157.0,Me whos been playing Halo like that for over a decade and I've practice it and you also can't tell me it doesn't feel different. Even on pc play and rpg with a controller and kbm ot feels different. Why can't we just see that both input methods have good qualities about them and that this is more about finding the right amount of aim magnetism not outright telling some players to eff off.
halo,fql2g5p,t1_fqi9len,1589443932.0,"That's where we get into ""how much"" aim assist so we make it balanced. 

I think the easiest way to see is to actually have a pro scene that allows using both. If we find 100% of pros that win use kbm and there's controller players that have great communication and strategy but still lose then we can add a little more assist. 

And then if pros are just using controller and kbm teams are losing the clearly the assist is too high.

But if we see pros split like 60/40 or 50/50 and winning based on strategy, map placement, communication then we have an amount of aim assist where it really comes down to preference and bow good your team practices rather than the input method. 

Will we ever see that who knows...till then guess we keep debating lol."
halo,fql24ka,t1_fqke492,1589443623.0,"No that's not even it. You can't tell me that kbm/controller feels the same. When you actually sit down to pkay regardless of aim assist it just FEELS different playing with each. 

Yes we should reduce the amount of bullet magnetism the game has but im3 tired of pc games just outright making it unplayable. Specially because a moderate bullet magnetism for controller is not going to make up for good communication and map movement.

If we have a pro scene where everyone is on controller and people who are known to be good on kbm cant3 win tournaments then yeah it's too strong. But if we also have team with controller with really good communication and map skills unable to win it means controller is just unplayable. 

Now if we see a roughly 50/50 among pros where they really just pick their preference and games mainly come down to strategy, map placement, and communication then I would say that is an ideal amount of assist for controllers. Enough to make both viable, but not too much to make one better than the other.

We can argue all day long about which one it is now but until we see professional teams playing we wont3 have a clear answer.

And tbh. It would just break my heart if I couldn't play Halo sitting back and relaxed or with elbows on my knees leaned forward and instead had to just be hunched over the way every pc game is. 

Also WASD are just buttons so not being able to actually control walking speak yeah kinda is just one reason why it isn't as immersive in gaming. So i would say immersion is a perfectly valid reason why some people prefer certain input methods."
halo,fql1jck,t1_fqkfz45,1589443060.0,Is it? Damn well I've been really enjoying the multiplayer lol
halo,fql1dek,t1_fqkhie2,1589442899.0,"Do they do this in tournaments? Because until we have pros being able to pick and choose and see which one actually wins tournaments we won't actually know whether the assist is too much or not. 

If we see pros winning tournaments with kbm and controller players losing tournaments then it would be clear that no controllers do not just instantly make you good it's the strategy and communication. 

So hey we'll have to wait and see."
halo,fql19ij,t1_fqkcgra,1589442792.0,"I can guarantee you people are not 4shotting you on controller, specially because if you aren't strafing or moving then you'll lose no matter what you play on. A very good kbm player that can consistently 4shot will beat controller players and it is still much harder to 4shot on controller because people DO strafe.

Just my opinion of course but my thing is I want halo to be enjoyable and accessible to as many as possible.

Halo is not a twitch shooter like say cod. it isn't just about aim. So many other variables go into it with map movement, setups etc. The controller/kbm is not a big enough difference imo when it comes to actually competing. The team with better communication and map movement is going to win I feel no matter what you use as a input method.

Plus let's be real. If you don't give controllers some kind of help then it's unplayable. Which alienates many and honestly hunched over on kbm is not the same. The beauty kf a controller i feel is you dont have to look at 30 buttons to press it's all right there you can play without looking at your kbm at all or having to readjust your mouse if you moved it too far left or right. Not to mention kb you're movement is entirely on/off. There's no gradient like a thumbstick has so you aren't always walking at the same speed. 

But hey this debate is never going to end. Until we have competitive tournament how we did for MLG and then see what pros are using we won't know how even or fair it is. If we see a tournament that everyone plays controller....yeah then controller has too much. But if we see a 50/50 kbm to controller usage. Or we see that knm team still win then we can tell that the controller isn't what makes you better it's still the map movement, communication etc."
halo,fql055x,t1_fqihn17,1589441717.0,"Yeah i very much put Reach/Halo2/ODST as my top 3 campaigns. The other were enjoyable too but those 3 were so unique and memorable imo. Halo 1 was good but felt basic soldier lets be badass type of game. 3 was also good but just continued on the story 

2 was a gamechanger telling us lore from both sides. Play as both arbiter and chief. Reach had a dark and rich story that went deep not just hey lets fight aliens.

halo,fqkztmm,t1_fqk80ex,1589441402.0,"Man I wish I could feel what it felt back then. Halo 2 wqs one of my favourite campaigns ever. The ability to play as the villain and just learn a lot from both sides. Even modern games dont create such good anti-heros. 

Enjoy it reclaimer. Halo is something special."
halo,fqkzow9,t3_gje168,1589441275.0,Despite some issues Halo 2 finally being out and being able to play it has brought me such nostalgia. I missed this game so much and I see why Halo was such a dominant shooter. I can't wait to play several hours more to.orrow since well....got nothing better to do.
halo,fqkzbpb,t3_giqedy,1589440926.0,"First off....I FREAKING LOVE IT! I spent hours playing today and the nostalgia hot me so hard. Played a few games, 5 campaign missions and more hours than I want to admit on multiplayer again. I freaking love it. 

A lot of the issues they are aware of but for me what I'm noticing. Some maps specially their forge maps have very weird lighting that make some parts super dark. 

Audio is wayyyy better but I still think some parts are choopy ( might just be me but idk)

Aiming sensitivity feels different between campaign and  multiplayer even with same settings. Idk might just be me. I play on controller (yeah Ik ugh aim magnetism must be the only reason I do decent I suck yada yada). 

Melees feel weird idk if it's me but sometimes I'll punch and punch and enemy seems to take no damage in campaign."
ARK,fqkyyvz,t1_fqi2cej,1589440591.0,Plua with krakens better dinos you can give it your axes and pickaxe to hold so it'll gather the same way you do at much higher rates. Immersive af.
cyberpunkgame,fqkok8n,t1_fqjl6vv,1589432095.0,did you send in this as a resume? or just a fun side thing you did after sending in a normal resume
cyberpunkgame,fqkoi3k,t3_gj841f,1589432051.0,"From now one that is the file you must send to employers, start the trend!"
formula1,fqkneyy,t1_fqixk6n,1589431281.0,I'm a spaniard and I don't do this but I see lots of angry americans though all the time I can tel by the accent lol
Economics,fqkn8bv,t3_gj1ggw,1589431152.0,Yep I lost my job and I'm 40k a year so + partner well over the 40k household. But nobody is safe unless you can work from home.
RocketLeague,fqiedea,t1_fqicmi3,1589394871.0,Oh I've never been in rule 1 with a teammate. I'm just saying personally I would ignore that and only apply it to opponents.
RocketLeague,fqic4w3,t1_fqi924t,1589394030.0,Well yeah you def did something wrong if that happens I agree..still not gonna give away a goal lol
ARK,fqi0hrx,t1_fqhzuqx,1589387738.0,This needs to be a mod.
EliteDangerous,fqhxf0n,t1_fqgv94h,1589386269.0,They also don't stay persistent in the universe. Carriers don't get repod you get your money back. They got sold for you not repoed.
pcgaming,fqgsut9,t1_fqgk3ty,1589356000.0,They never said they were going to fix the audio for reqch before having Halo 2. Keep in mind infinity is coming out soon and with covid 19 I'm sure they are already forced to crunch to even remotely manage to finish the rest of MCC on time. If that means having to wait a little to iron out the kinks fine by me. You're more then welcome not to play until it's all fixed and released.
RocketLeague,fqgro65,t1_fqgkpzs,1589354892.0,No cause then a 2v2 turns into a 2v0...whih might as well just give a goal way. Rule 1 against opponents just turns a 2v2 into a 1v1 or a 3v3 into a 2v2 fair still. Rule 1 is fair
halo,fqgrk2b,t1_fqgl4mt,1589354785.0,"Ah yes noon where? California? So 9pm europe? I have to be in bed by 10 because I work early so man why couldn't they release it noon europe time?

Ah shit noon europe time is 8pm japan time so tokyo is not gonna be able to play cause they'll have work to do....should release the game noon japan time....damn10pm in new york? Who is going to be awake at that hour people have to go sleep....

You see...the world does not revolve around you. Just cause it's a bad time for you doesn't mean someone else isn't getting screwed over even worse so stfu stay up late like I did, or be patient and play the next day like many other people around the world are forced to do. Game released 5am Europe time you think you got it bad?"
careerguidance,fqg8vyx,t1_fqfwotp,1589340506.0,True and i am a citizen in spain  but honestly i make more money here as an entry pevel job in new york than i would in spain. I could probably save up money here for a few years and have more than most people would ever in Spain. So might just grind for a few years and move after that.
EliteDangerous,fqfvzri,t1_fqa4n3i,1589332790.0,"Upkeep certainly makes sense just as our current ships have upkeep (refuel repair is esssntially just upkeep for using them).

Jump times should have been reversed imo. 5 minutes to jump, 15 minute cooldown so we can search the system or do whatever business we had to do while it coolsdown."
EliteDangerous,fqfmpns,t1_fqfmhxm,1589327690.0,It's my own FC. Sometimes I says Xcr to refuel but button is grey and have to un-dock and re-dock to get it to work. It's beta so I'm not mad or anything but something i figured to ask.
EliteDangerous,fqf2met,t3_ghkrvt,1589317681.0,"is there a big thread for discussion about this?  
Anybody else unable to refuel at fleet carriers?"
