DeadBedrooms,fb62d2d,t1_fb61gfy,1576539655.0,"Yes, months ago. He even just brought me flowers this evening. He said he is sorry if he hurt my feelings this weekend (I wanted to have sex, he wasn't interested). What man turns down no strings attached blow jobs? I dont understand how he can be so loving,  affectionate and yet not want sex. I dont look any different than I did when he used to not be able to keep his hands off me. I was dealing with serious medical stuff...the possibility of losing my leg and just wasn't into it at all, but I still did several times a month.....because I knew it was important.  Sorry to vent... I'm just lost with what else to do or try."
DeadBedrooms,fb617dn,t1_fb36b8d,1576538843.0,"I've told him I'm sorry if I ever made him feel rejected. We still used to have sex, but the most I could was once a week (my health issues were bad along with libido killing meds). I know he probably felt like it was pity sex out of obligation, and that's how I feel now."
DeadBedrooms,fb60ffd,t1_fb48wmd,1576538307.0,"I do this and he does this for me....we always leave little notes, we text first thing when he wakes up (I'm already at work) .... everything is phenomenal,  except he wont initiate sex and doesn't respond when I try to unless I just bluntly ask (and then I feel like its pity sex). I do need to pull myself back a little I guess and do some things for myself sometimes."
DeadBedrooms,fb5yr4e,t1_fb35brq,1576537156.0,"He is such a great husband and father... always leaving sweet notes, surprising me with my favorite ice cream when he comes home. Our only issue is in the bedroom, sex is fantastic when it does happen....I just want him to initiate it and want me like he used to without it feeling like pity sex when I initiate."
DeadBedrooms,fb5yja1,t1_fb36x2g,1576537006.0,"I think it is some sort of resentment, even possibly subconsciously. I'm scared he doesnt see me in a sexual way anymore. We are both getting older, but I still look pretty much the same as I did 5 years ago when he couldn't keep his hands off me."
DeadBedrooms,fb5yb3n,t1_fb3sjua,1576536855.0,"Oh, he knows he satisfies me when we do have sex.... i always climax and i usually finish him off orally. He's knows I'm very happy with his skills. I tell him often."
DeadBedrooms,fb5y17m,t1_fb4hsqo,1576536674.0,"The last time I did this, he didn't initiate anything. I knew if I pushed him, it would be out of pity and I'd just rather not."
DeadBedrooms,fb5xwmu,t1_fb4r9kg,1576536590.0,"I offer it to him and 3 times this year (not all the time) I have been turned down. I just wanted to do something for him, not wanting anything in return."
DeadBedrooms,fb5xo7r,t1_fb4yfsp,1576536434.0,"I know he used to watch some, but dont know if he still does. I've offered to watch one together but he didn't seem too interested in that."
DeadBedrooms,fb5xk2h,t1_fb517nu,1576536356.0,I'm so sorry you are going through this. I lost my mom to suicide. Sending lots of prayers and thoughts your way. I hope things get better for you.
DeadBedrooms,fb5x35t,t1_fb5p32r,1576536042.0,"I know it is.... we sat and had a long talk many months back about how sorry I was if I ever made him feel rejected and he said he understood what I was going through and he was just happy I was feeling better. I completely understand his point of view. I have even been much more adventurous too.... I've pretty much told him there was nothing I wouldn't try at least once, and when we do have sex its fantastic. I just want the same enthusiasm and not having feel like its duty sex (but that's exactly how it feels to me). I hope things get better with your wife. Best of luck to you and thanks for the advice."
DeadBedrooms,fb4z4kw,t1_fb4h1dr,1576518004.0,"We still had sex, just only once a week. I didn't cut him off completely. I had just been diagnosed with some serious health issues and was also on a libido killing medication. Sometimes things happen that we have little control over unfortunately. I always made sure to be intimate at least once a week, even when I felt like shit, because I knew it was important for us to maintain that."
quittingsmoking,eyz2cju,t3_czkm9f,1567607920.0,"Get the book or audiobook ""The easy way to quit smoking "" by Allen Carr. It really helps deal with the psychological issues to help quit. Many celebrities have used the book to quit (Ellen, Ashton Kutcher,  James Spader). Good luck to you!!"
depression,eui5w1s,t1_eudvgml,1563841040.0,Thank you... I try to not worry about the little things but when it's just so much everyday its frustrating. I hope the meds start helping soon.
depression,ets1406,t3_cd0hjp,1563133904.0,Exactly how I feel all the time.
