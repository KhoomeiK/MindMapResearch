Literally anyone you dont feel you benefit from them coming. Trim them. Once you dock the guest list trim any extras that are going to cast more. IE my cousin saved over 500 just nixing alcohol. I personally am gwtring married at a wooded park. No decorations needed its already gorgeous. And because there's already seating built in im not paying for chairs.
