AssassinsCreedOdyssey,f4zkc44,t3_dmcast,1571909356.0,yeah i only risk it if there’s no one else in hearing range. engravings should be included with the health bar yeah. i wish i had an answer for us. but i like to live life on edge sometimes lol
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,f4zgs3n,t3_dmcast,1571906771.0,"i have the same issue, i usually don’t risk not doing the critical assassination a for a captain or a higher ranking ‘soldier’ or guard but if they’re a smaller one with less armor i just go for it and hope for the best. sometimes it doesn’t work and sometimes it does, i’m not sure what determines it. i’d like to know too but i’m guessing it just depends on the dude?"

GirlGamers,f45mv8w,t1_f45mok9,1571384515.0,although i do see both sides. i hated when girls would play with us and try to impress or flirt with my best friend (a dude) at the time. they see it as a competition i think.
GirlGamers,f45mok9,t3_djjile,1571384237.0,this is exactly why i only really have male friends on xbox. you get the odd creep but most are just genuine nice people. the girls i’ve played with have always been so “territorial” for lack of a better term.
Needafriend,f317zf5,t3_df2iyi,1570569755.0,people on here are such assholes wow. i was in a similar situation but i was the girl he was talking to on the game. i hope you find her sis! good luck x
Needafriend,f2u0r5b,t3_de9f5o,1570404415.0,i’m 20f and in pretty much the same boat too :) i’m always up for a chat if anyone wants to
GirlGamers,f2j3jop,t3_dd6hus,1570266742.0,"my name is chloe, i live in australia and i’m an xbox gamer. i’m really in need of some good friends right now as i’m going through a tough time and have recently “broken up” with my best friend and only gaming buddy. it’d be healthy for me to have more female friends that are into gaming too :)

i play red dead redemption 2, gta v and dabble in battle royale style games. 

my gt is chloe2908"

depression,f1xjs9a,t3_db29de,1569799334.0,"if this comforts you at all, i can relate to you. hard. i’m only 20 and have been through endless shit that not many people would understand. i’m struggling too. cigarettes and alcohol daily. not just casually, it’s like i’m subconsciously killing myself with it. we’re all here for you. and we all care. even if it seems like you have no one else. please stay. time heals. at least that’s what i’m telling myself."
depression,f1l7q9j,t3_d9sb7z,1569547683.0,"hey. you’re gonna be okay. i know there’s not much anyone could say to help, and i know you don’t see it right now, but time heals. i promise."
RedDeadOnline,f1fnye4,t1_f1fnw8k,1569448738.0,"yep, hence my friend :)"
