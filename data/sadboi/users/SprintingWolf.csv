Equestrian,fqzhlb1,t3_gls299,1589767542.0,"Hello!! It is NOT too late. It is NEVER too late. Don‚Äôt give up!! We‚Äôve all been there. ‚ÄúI can handle this greenie‚Äù surprise. You can‚Äôt lol. It happens. You learn together! 

I know it‚Äôs daunting and the horse community can be very snooty. I wish I had resources for you but I don‚Äôt! 

Horses and horse knowledge just comes with time. My mom wouldn‚Äôt even stand near the horses when we went to look at my first horse. Then she fell in love with them, and is a pro now. She was in her 40s! 

Try to find someone who has the patience and knowledge you need. We were fortunate enough to have someone in our lives that really held our hand through it. 

And don‚Äôt feel stupid! You aren‚Äôt stupid for asking questions! You‚Äôre learning. And questions are how we learn. 

You‚Äôre doing great. It is a journey. Try to appreciate every step of the way. Even the road blocks. 

I read in a book once that horses don‚Äôt have any idea of clocks and calendars. No schedules for them. So maybe even though you thought things would be progressing faster, it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre doing it wrong! 

I hope this helps and isn‚Äôt too all over the place. Please message me any time I can try to help you as well!!"
