povertyfinance,fpppfzy,t1_fppn68m,1588806617.0,"You definitely need a resume review if you haven't had one. A shitty resume and you won't even get a second glance. You really need to highlight what you know, your experience, etc succinctly but in a way that stands out, you can imagine how that's hard to do. Also, always include a cover letter, and make it tailored to each job if possible. I'm not a pro, but if you need help and feel comfortable, I would be happy to review your resume and a basic cover letter for you (not for money or anything).

I'm not kidding when I say the entire room went silent and every person there was staring at me in horror. I couldn't stop apologizing to the nurses but they were so kind, just put me in a wheel chair and staff appeared from nowhere and was already cleaning the floors. I was examined immediately and in surgery within 20 minutes. I never stopped bleeding that whole time. Scariest day of my life. I had a miscarriage and I started hemorrhaging out of nowhere. It was like someone turned on a fountain. I lost so much blood I passed out on the way to the operating room, they had to revive me in order to put me under properly for the surgery.

If you got in the shower, rinsed your hair and shampooed it, you could finish in 5 minutes. Don't think about using the loofah or shaving your legs or anything else. Just wash your hair, enjoy the warm water, and it'll be done in just 5 mins, 10 mins if you include drying off, dressing, and getting back in bed. Good luck, we understand your pain."

atheism,ffipgmd,t1_ffii70q,1579979460.0,"Yeah it's accredited. Both the original bible college I attended and the one I ended up taking courses with online were much cheaper than any other college options I looked into though. I was accepted out of high school to the University of Washington but couldn't attend because I couldn't afford it. My parents weren't helping me at all and I wasn't even offered subsidized loans from the school. One of the appeals of the bible college was I could live there and pay my tuition/ rent monthly, which I afforded by working full time, minimum wage jobs. I had a few small loans because I also took some community college classes, but nothing crazy. Paid them off a few years back."
atheism,ffik0tt,t1_ffid0zn,1579975713.0,"Yeah they straight up tell you if they don't have an answer or explanation to your questions that you just have to have faith it's all true. Completely relieves them of the burden of proof. I was taught for instance, the bible is the divine word of God. It doesn't matter that it's legit impossible to say it's been passed down without change for 2000 years, they say it. They say all 66 books were divinely protected and you can trust that it's all correct because God wouldn't have allowed it to be otherwise. If you argue with that, then you're doubting God, so people accept these types of explanations"

atheism,ffihv8n,t1_ffhnvg1,1579974241.0,"Actually church history is one of the things that helped fuel my doubt. In my little Baptist college, we studied the beginning church from the bible, then essentially jump 1,500 years straight to Martin Luther and after. I mean, we glossed over the other years, but it's difficult to acknowledge all that other religious history when in contradicts what you're teaching. We were taught Catholics weren't real Christians, so why would we waste much time on them? Sooo, the belief was God allowed 1,500 years of Catholicism before bothering to start his ""real"" church. None of it makes sense!"

atheism,ffhhul7,t1_ffhgnuf,1579935917.0,"It's kind of crazy how it works for most people to be honest. Usually when someone says God spoke to them, it's never like an audible voice telling you what to do, it's much more subtle and complicated than that. Usually while praying, you're setting yourself up for God to ""answer"" in some way. For example, a very clear idea or thought pops in your head, and you're convinced God gave you that thought. Or I would do really stupid shit like flip open my bible and the first verse I read was what God wanted me to do. The more complex side of it is things like my interest in China. I thought being really excited about going to live in China meant God had put the idea on my heart. Or if you're dealing with something and you read something that seems applicable to your situation, then boom it's from God. The worst thing is it's taboo to question somebody when they say they think God is speaking to them, so everyone goes along with whatever. No one questioned the 19 year old buying a one way ticket to China. Just praised me for serving God and doing ""his will"". It took me years to realize most of the stories of God communicating or miracles occurring are grossly exaggerated. People just want to believe so bad..."

I wasn't sure how I felt, because I was really, really angry. But this process of questioning started about 7 years ago, so it hasn't been an overnight decision, that's for sure. But I had this feeling like, writing it out and admitting I don't believe anymore was a really concrete step that I had been hesitant to fully take.

My classes included things like ""Christology"" and ""Harmeunitics"", I literally can give you the generally believed Christian answer to all these hard questions. But you want to know something? I don't believe any of it anymore. It was a long journey too where I spent years trying to reconcile one question that ate at me: why did God allow suffering? How could he love us and torture us at the same time? How many people throughout history have literally been physically and mentally tortured in unspeakable ways? How could a loving God allow this?

The answer is he can't. The God of the Bible doesn't exist, he can't exist. It was a horrible, painful truth to realize for someone such as myself, as I was incredibly devoted to serving God for many years. The thing that held me back from accepting the truth for so long was fear. It's incredibly motivating when you genuinely believe not serving God would equal an eternity of torture in Hell. This, btw, was the second most convincing reason God couldn't be who Religion says he is. A loving God does not condemn people to an eternity of suffering and anguish. It's the most horrible cruelty I can imagine. Anyway, sorry to hijack your comment, I've been thinking about this stuff a lot lately."
