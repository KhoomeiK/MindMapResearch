AskReddit,fj35kdv,t3_fb534k,1582968399.0,I find myself constantly thinking up scenarios of meeting people and what I would say/do. It gets so detailed sometimes that I get stuck in a loop for hours. The thing that sucks is right when I snap out of it I get sad because I missed the artificial interaction.

Rammstein,fff6ud3,t1_fff6lxr,1579877200.0,I have some experience on the highway but my grandfather was with me. I‚Äôm going to be practicing all year with him to prepare but It will be my first time alone on the way there.
Rammstein,ffcpt5g,t1_ffcp4cu,1579804659.0,I usually fall asleep listening to podcasts so it will have to be loud music to keep me focused. I'm really excited to meet people who love Rammstein! I've never met anyone that enjoys the music I do.
Rammstein,ffcn41c,t1_ffcmiw3,1579802973.0,"I don't really have much confidence it was more of a last-minute boost of courage that has brought me this far, haha. The way I see it is an opportunity to see one of my favorite bands of all time, meet people who I can actually have something in common with, and make new memories! I'm glad I have so much time to prepare and get my finances in order I'm not sure if I would've been able to make it if it was early in the year."
Rammstein,ffcl4nh,t1_ffckqan,1579801773.0,"Glad to hear lol. I'm so excited to make some kick-ass memories! I've wanted to see Rammstein live since I was 11, My parents raised me on metal."
Rammstein,ffchy9t,t1_ffchkoh,1579799847.0,Oh my gosh I was actually looking at a bag like this one last night :) I‚Äôll make sure that it fits within any requirements before the concert but I‚Äôll definitely be getting one for myself.
Rammstein,ffch6g5,t1_ffcggh6,1579799375.0,"You‚Äôve assumed correctly! That‚Äôs so awesome I was planning on traveling to see them outside the US later in life because I assumed I would never see them in the US. So when they announced this tour I decided that I would go no matter the distance! I‚Äôve been to a few other metal shows and they were all very pleasant so I‚Äôm very excited. I‚Äôm in no way worried about the pit, just navigating Chicago on my own makes me nervous especially since the concert will end later at night. Thanks for the cross strap bag tip I will have to get one!"
Rammstein,ffcej0g,t1_ffcbfzi,1579797748.0,"Yeah my moms a huge worrier she is freaking out saying things like ‚Äúoh my god you just turned 20, you‚Äôre going to be sex trafficked, you‚Äôre going to be lost and alone, and my personal favorite what happens if you get taken advantage of in the pit?!‚Äù It‚Äôs funny because she did wilder things back in her days. Thank you for the advice I‚Äôm going to be booking my hotel this weekend!"
Rammstein,ffcb4ok,t1_ffcasdo,1579795626.0,Google maps says it will be a minimum of 5 hours but I‚Äôve been stuck on a highway for over ten hours numerous times. I‚Äôll definitely get some advice from those subs too.
Rammstein,ffcaxlo,t1_ffcal2x,1579795500.0,Thanks! ü§ò
Rammstein,ffc9ytv,t1_ffc9ok9,1579794896.0,Thanks!That‚Äôs really helpful I was just going to kind of figure it out as I go but I‚Äôll definitely take that advice.
Rammstein,ffc9jqj,t1_ffc9ena,1579794630.0,I‚Äôm going to find a hotel because I imagine I‚Äôm going to be very tired after the concert.
Rammstein,ffc8siw,t1_ffc7zco,1579794148.0,How was the driving experience? Numerous people have told me the traffic is awful and that I should use the train but I‚Äôve never done anything like that before.
Rammstein,ffc8gy9,t1_ffc7z6r,1579793941.0,I‚Äôm from a tiny town outside Columbus. I haven‚Äôt really planned my route out yet I figured I would just use google maps and take note of gas stations I can stop by along the way. I‚Äôm new at the whole ‚Äúroad trip‚Äù thing so sorry if I‚Äôm doing this wrong lol. I need all the advice I can get!
Rammstein,ffc7cy2,t1_ffc75uj,1579793229.0,On the floor I‚Äôm in the Feuerzone.
Rammstein,ffc786i,t1_ffc6v9c,1579793142.0,Yeah I‚Äôm planning on being there hours early since I was able to grab Feuerzone tickets. I‚Äôm really excited but my mother has planted the concern in my head since it‚Äôs Chicago and I‚Äôve never been to a big city alone.
LushCosmetics,fc9t4z9,t1_fc9smc8,1577557828.0,I couldn‚Äôt agree more I used to go all out on bath bombs but then I started trying their other products and I now only get bath bombs as gifts or as an occasional treat. :)
LushCosmetics,fc9rzbi,t1_fc9rkhu,1577557325.0,"Thank you, I have to limit myself or I would buy every product they sell. Lush has never disappointed me and I've been a happy customer for two years now! :)"
LushCosmetics,fc9q5tn,t1_fc9pa9w,1577556517.0,Thanks so much for your advice I'm ordering it right now!
LushCosmetics,fc9ordz,t1_fc9oh4u,1577555891.0,"I'm really going towards Rose Jam now but my other favorites are honey I washed the kids, and the olive branch."
LushCosmetics,fc9oc4o,t1_fc9o238,1577555709.0,That's great now I know what to look forward to for 2020!
LushCosmetics,fc9nndp,t1_fc9n1dn,1577555415.0,That's not surprising since my body wash lasts so long. I'm definitely going to get the rose jam!
LushCosmetics,fc9mn53,t1_fc9lzze,1577554964.0,I'm definitely going to buy some now. The hard thing is deciding which one I want since I only buy one perfume at a time.
LushCosmetics,fc9lbgi,t1_fc9kybd,1577554378.0,"Wow that‚Äôs great! I‚Äôm really interested in rose jam, the olive branch, and honey I washed the kids. I‚Äôve never tried any yog nog products."
LushCosmetics,fc9jlch,t1_fc9ivh8,1577553625.0,Thanks for your input! I've been thinking about buying since all my other perfumes (not lush) barely last an hour for me.
insaneparents,fbckgqw,t1_fbck151,1576726075.0,"Don‚Äôt feel stupid parents should help and nurture their children, not try to sabotage them. Take care of yourself and your family don‚Äôt let her negativity influence living a long, happy, and loving life."
insaneparents,fbcamzk,t1_fbcah3o,1576719585.0,"So sorry your family is going through this, good on you for cutting these toxic people out of your life. It‚Äôs much better and safer for your children."
AmItheAsshole,fbca2tc,t3_eclte1,1576719213.0,"I‚Äôm going to say YTA on this one. Your intentions mean well but this is just really weird to me. I think you and your wife should sit down and maybe speak to a doctor about this medication, estrogen effects on the male body, and breastfeeding vs formula. I‚Äôm hoping this is a shitpost tbh. Your behavior is strangely obsessive and over the top for something like this, please sit down with a doctor and your wife and discuss this. Then maybe go to a counselor and discuss your issues such as going behind your wife‚Äôs back. Did you really think she wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with you pulling out your moob one day and sticking it in your baby‚Äôs mouth?"
insaneparents,fbc3m85,t3_ecknvx,1576714843.0,The cps comment sent shivers down my spine. What a disgusting human being.
AmItheAsshole,fb73l1y,t3_ebstt8,1576572064.0,YTA and I hope she leaves you and finds someone who really loves and appreciates her in sickness and health.
MotionlessInWhite,f96o6vh,t3_e42kdj,1575148829.0,Great pic! I haven't been to a concert since 2018. I have got to see them in 2020 again!
BreakUps,f95kz48,t3_e3xjgn,1575130049.0,"Oh another thing that has helped tremendously is to journal how you‚Äôre feeling. I have a months worth of letters I‚Äôve written out to him, he will never see them but this has helped me let go a bit. Keep your head up‚ù§Ô∏è"
BreakUps,f95kpbx,t3_e3xjgn,1575129870.0,"Well I‚Äôm newly single as well and I‚Äôve been binge watching movies, trying new video games, and talking to people on reddit. These things have helped me keep my mind off of it but for the first week I was in your situation I dropped 15 pounds. The best advice I can give is to just try and distract yourself with other things I know it‚Äôs hard but after awhile it will get easier."
depression,f8w8ywp,t3_e2gnrw,1574885695.0,"Oh yeah, it doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm a lucid dreamer either. I can go wherever I want and be with loved ones I miss dearly."
AmItheAsshole,f7ynu5c,t3_dy66j8,1574098049.0,NTA this is a very hostile environment and I personally wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable being there either.
AmItheAsshole,f7a75kb,t3_dv2lvh,1573522130.0,"NTA, she needs to get her dog under control before it bites the wrong person and gets put down. She could‚Äôve easily put the dog in another room."
LushCosmetics,f72fhyj,t3_du6yqd,1573361282.0,They have the Cup O‚Äô Coffee face and body mask. I‚Äôve personally never used it but I hear that quite a bit of people like it.
