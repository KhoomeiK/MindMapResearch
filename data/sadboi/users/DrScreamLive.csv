@OP idk if it brings you comfort or not to know this but it does bring me comfort to know I'm not alone. I'd look into some sort of practice that separates you from your mind. I dont mean to become super religious or anything but the research has already concluded that some sort of meditative practice softens the impact of those thoughts you have. 

Like back when I used to get this weird feeling pushing me to grab my gun and off myself it was really strong. Eventually I started meditating and the feeling got weaker because my mind got stronger at controlling the focus.

microdosing,fkexgq6,t3_fhwu7p,1584122718.0,"So after consuming some of the other comments and being someone who has clinical depression which tripped right before starting MD, I'd like to offer some things I experienced after my 2 gram trip as well as my microdose experience. (This can all be seen on my YT channel as well linked below)

https://youtu.be/XWEfPnCDKUI

So I found out about microdosing about 2 months ago. In that time I was learning how to grow my own mushrooms which I've succeeded in and am currently onto my second tub (my first tub produced about 80 grams of dried shrooms which will last me a lifetime haha).

I took 2 grams in lemon juice and all I can say is it was one of the scariest experiences I've ever had in my life. On the other hand, it was one of the things I needed to experience to discover that I'm not actually wanting to kill myself but rather uncover my ""true self""

This depression was just an oppression of my true self fighting my brain which has been wired for whatever reason to hide instinctively. Feel free to watch the video for a full run down of my trip report.

I had been taking antidepressants for like 6 months prior to tripping and I started to slowly taper off the antidepressant a month before tripping. I was taking 300 mg of wellbutrin at the time and cut it in half to 150 mg for 3 to 4 weeks. Then I cut them out and a few days later ingested the 2 grams via a lemon tek. Holy shit. 

During my trip I spoke to a female who was guiding me through my trip with the music I was listening to. I vomited out some emotional baggage I was holding onto. I discovered I hated myself in my current form and knew I had my work cut out for me. 

I'd recommend taking the 2 grams alone in your room on a day you WILL NOT be disturbed at all. If you think someone may come to bother you then dont take it. If you can, tell someone who you trust that you will be taking the shrooms and ask them if you can call them if things go south. Have them on speed dial becsuee phones are hard to navigate while tripping. It took me an hour to find good music because I forgot how to type and kept trying to figure out how to spell ""happy EDM mix"" 

My microdosing hasn't had any profound effect other than making me notice my internal dialogue (more can be found on my instagram @DrScreamLive) and allowing me to put a pause to it. I believe this has been the biggest benefit. They say microdosing allows your default mode network to disengage and reset which is what I noticed precisely. 

Please please for the love of god be safe and dont have any negative thoughts ruminating in your head when you trip. If you're truly depressed and worried then skip that day. Even clinically depressed people have a day where things seem OK. Dont rush into this because that will prevent true growth. Start meditating TODAY even if you dont feel like it or feel like ""it's not working""

Meditation isnt a linear progression scale of growth. Some days are great and other days you cant sit still. The growth comes from trying and NOT from succeeding. Every attempt is a repetition you've completed even when you fail. When you go to the gym and fail to pick up a weight, your central nervous system still counts it and some of your muscle still gets a little micro tear in it which allows you to grow stronger. Failure isnt failure even if our mind has been conditioned to believe it to be so. 

Recognize that the vast majority of humanity has love for you even if you're skeptical of your own self love at the moment. During the trip you'll come to realise this and may even cry a bit. When your trip begins, just let it be. Whatever happens happens. I became okay with dying during the trip. If it happens, I knew on an intuitive level that i would be okay.

Also drink water you fucks. Love you and hope you grow from whatever you choose to do. Good luck my friend! If you want to have someone on call during your trip and you're worried about friends judging you, reach out to me and I can be there on discord through the whole process in case things go south. Just shoot me a DM via instagram (@DrScreamLive or email me Admin@DrScream.Net). I wont talk to you during your trip but if things get scary you can just put on your headphones and I'll help keep you grounded while the negatives pass through. 

If you choose to do this alone then wear a sleeping mask and noise canceling headphones if you have them. If not then regular headphones will suffice. Have everything you need near you like:

- water
- a bucket for vomiting
- a bathroom nearby as you will likely be peeing a lot from water consumption.
- headphones and mask
- covers
- ability to adjust temperature of room like a fan or something.
- go to therapy a few weeks in a row prior to tripping if you can so you can be in the best place possible for inner work.

Some people experience a past trauma come up. If this happens during your trip just ask the mushrooms nicely that you'd rather not work on that right now and then surrender to the mushrooms. If they believe you are ready, get ready to deal with the trauma. If they see you're not okay, itll likely just teach you something else or itll just allow you to enjoy the rest of your trip (this was my experience).

All of this is my own experience and you should totally consult a licensed professional prior to taking the advice because everyone's experience is different. However if you do choose to partake, please please cover all your areas. Set and setting always are primary. Happy travels!"

Are you single? How old are you? Can you afford to live on very little while you try things out? Do you have other responsibilities? Those kinds of things determine what the best path forward is for you.

I'll try to offer some massively generalized advice that I'm using for myself in an attempt to help you situation. Maybe some of my ideas will spark your own that can help you create a path to your liking.

The ultimate goal is personal fulfillment and happiness. Never forget that. With that said, you need to find what it is you enjoy. If you're young and can afford to live at home, take advantage of that to try new things. What is something that someone else is doing that you think you'd enjoy? Figure out how they got there and replicate it as best as you can.

Where profits mix together with enjoyment is the real gold. Don't think of it on the surface either. You can get just as much fulfillment selling people hot dogs as you do being a nurse when you consider your underlying value of bringing people together. 

Finding a vehicle is what you want to try to figure out. If you're older then you should think and meditate on what it is you've enjoyed in the past and try to take bits and pieces of what you enjoyed and run with that. 

If you're younger then you need to sit down and come up with a list of 20+ things you'd like to try and go try them. See if they're enjoyable and while you try them, think about how you can monetize them. This is marketing. Watch videos from great marketers and try to figure out how they are doing their marketing and where you can do the same with your own niche.

Another route is a career you'd like to pursue. Not everyone is meant to own their own business so maybe try to go down a path of a job you've always fantasized about. Dont think small either.  The bigger the better.

Its 2020 and there's never been a better time to start something you enjoy.

At the same time while you do all of this, plan your finances in a way that allows you to have something even if you fail those pursuits. Real estate is the tried and true method I'm pursuing as a fail safe. 

Good luck! Dont let mental illness be more of a crutch than it has to be. Yes we get sad. Yes we feel hopeless. Those feelings will pass. When they come, just accept its ""one of those days"" and when it's gone, try and try again. I'm rooting for ya :)"

It sounds super cliche but do it even if it feels like you're faking it or an inner critic pops up saying no it wont. We need to grab our brain sometimes and discipline it.

Also allow yourself to be angry. Your suffering comes when you want reality to be other than it is. In this moment you are angry and that is okay. Get angry. Grab a pillow and punch it. Grab a plate, go outside to a place no one is and throw it to the wall or floor. Just let out some frustration. Peace be with you friend"
bipolar,fjo0hp0,t3_feef6e,1583518035.0,"It's so scary because I'm literally in the same position. I make $35 an hour and, while I love the gkkd pay and steady paycheck, I'm finding that I do a lot of the work because my coworkers are super toxic and lazy. 

I've devised a plan for myself and I thought I'd share it in case you find anything useful in it.

Step 1: Get expenses down. This has been to get my expenses down to bare minimums. I'm only 24 with no responsibilities so this was easy. Now that I've got my expenses down I can afford to take a pay cut. This is now leading to step 2.

Step 2: Get another job. Potentially one that pays less because it allows you more free time to brain storm what you could create that could bring in supplemental income and maybe even the bulk of your income eventually.

Step 3: Get to thinking and reading. Read a lot of books on business development and watching videos by people like Gary Vee (Vaynerchuk). He has a lot of videos on pursuing happiness over a fat bank account. My favorite book of all is The 4 hour work week (Be aware that this book being read through the eyes of a hypomanic can trigger you quitting your job on the spot but that isnt recommended as your mental health suffers when you're in a super chaotic state. Better to line up that job prior to quitting the first).

Step 4: start working on learning marketing and how to run advertisements on platforms like facebook and google. These platforms are super powerful for creating income.

Step 5 bonus tip: Go to stores like Marshall's and TJ Maxx clearance section and use a scanner to see what items are selling for on Ebay and amazon. If its selling for $20 at Marshall's and $50 on ebay, buy it and flip it. Make sure you calculate shipping costs too. 

Find something someone is doing that you want to emulate and try to contact them and ask for literally just 2 minutes of their time to ask them a question. Have a thought provoking question that shows you know their work well. At the end of the call ask if they'd be okay with you emailing them the occasional question that will be very occasional and not at all often. 

I'm not sure your age but regardless of age, it's never too late to try to pursue what is meaningful."
Psychonaut,fjnvwi2,t3_fecwxr,1583515392.0,Look into stoicism and read up on some pretty famous philosophers that dealt with nihilism and existentialism. They kind of documented their process in rediscovering their own meaning in life.
BorderlinePDisorder,fjnvml5,t1_fjn9ouo,1583515245.0,Hopefully OP takes your input because I'm the anxious avoidant type too and have had instinctive reflexes to respond to people this way but I know deep down its just my own issues and not theirs. I don't think anyone should be in a relationship when they're responding to their SO this way...

Every time you treat yourself with compassion for not being perfect is a successful rep pushing you to a better you. Give yourself a break and celebrate the small victories bud! Weve only got one life but we just need to try to slow down and smell the Rose's as corny as it sounds"

Psychonaut,fjbtbja,t1_fjbsm5l,1583200960.0,Just because science says that these dimensions arent heal and are in fact just a lens through which you process said chemical reactions doesnt mean that it's not possible.
