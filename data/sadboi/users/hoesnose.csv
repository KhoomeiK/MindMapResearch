Your daughter isn’t healthy and your ex wife really needs to get a grip imo. However, I don’t think that was really the right way to go about it at all. I think confronting her about it in front of her brother out of the blue most likely made her feel humiliated. Having a sit down with her and your ex I feel is the only way to come to a conclusion.
