morbidquestions,f06o44m,t3_d3pvgw,1568441985.0,"I didnt go into a coma but I ODed and had some wild hallucinations. 

I took an OD of some of my meds... one of which being lamictal. After passing out I started to puke on myself. At some point I tried to get out of my bed to pee. 

Well Lamicatal is a scary OD. As soon as I attempted to stand my legs collapsed under me as if they were there. I had no use of my lower body. At all. It was gone. In addition I was completley blind. I couldnt see anything. Of course i was scared because i didnt want to be blind and gimp. I wanted to be dead. After trying to pull myself back up on my bed multiple times i turned over my dresser and bedside table. I finally gave up, pissed myself and pulled the pillows and covers from the bed and slept on the floor. 

I dont know why but at some point I started hearing an alarm. I THOUGHT my mom was at my apartment. I kept screaming ""at her"" to turn off the alarm. 

In my mind at the time I was pissed. Because my mom (who wasnt there) ""wouldnt"" turn off the alarm. 

I thought she was sitting in my living room being stubborn and trying to make me wake up. Shes done shit like that in the past cause I've always had trouble sleeping. 

At this point I'm SCREAMING at her calling her terrible things. I'm screaming at her and telling her how shes horrible cause I am laying in my room dying and instead of getting the police she is being stubborn about me getting up. 

Finally i open my bedroom door and (i still cant aee btw) crawl towards the sound of the alarm that's going off. It's my fucking alarm on my laptop. I NEVER set that alarm. Ever. Never have and havent since. Somehow the alarm was set tho to go off that morning. 

I crawled towards my laptop since I couldnt walk or see... and start fucking with the mouse and frantically clicking at random hoping to click the dialogue box to shut it off. 

Eventually i got it. 

Not sure when i realized my mom wasnt there. 

As the morning went on my vision got to where i could squint and see through the blur. I took a picture of my wrist, as i had also slit it... in an attempt to make sure if OD didnt work I would bleed out. 

I sent the pic to my dad. Didnt say anything. Then my phone started going off and i didnt answer. Then my mom showed up. 

The apartment was wrecked. I never saw it since i couldnt see. She said it looked like i had been attacked and mh apartment had been ransacked. 

I refused to go to the hospital even though i was toxically sick. 

Tldr i lived."
