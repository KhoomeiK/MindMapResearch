BPD,fqxd0te,t3_glfgi4,1589730212.0,"I see this as an issue with self esteem at the root. This is what causes the feeling of not deserving things and the immense guilt associated with wanting things for my own enjoyment. 

I'm also struggling with this and have greatly improved it over the past year with my boyfriend. It started with him helping me stop casual negative self talk. Making self depracating jokes, casually downplaying my achievements and never ever giving myself praise was just how I operated for years, but not allowing myself to think that way and simply redirecting my thoughts to a more positive inclination helped to the point where I don't have those thoughts anymore. I used to be plagued by 24/7 violent criticism from myself and now I can look in the mirror without any makeup and not a judgemental thought enters my mind, I simply see my body and face. I'm much more at peace with myself. 

The next step is continuing to build and strengthen my confidence which I believe comes through proving my worth to myself. I'm currently waiting for my course to start which I am extremely excited for as it will launch me into the next section of my life and I will be educated, independent and competent in my field. I will be able to confidently have trust in my abilities which I think will reflect in my sense of self and personality. We'll see how it goes but my advice would be to find a sense of purpose and know that you're good at it. Inner confidence comes from positive confirmation so find something to positively confirm and stick with it and maybe it will alleviate some of this constant self doubt and lack of self esteem because I don't want to live like this anymore either, I want to just live freely and to my full potential.  Best of luck bb"

They honestly sound like horrible people who are possibly projecting their own massive issues onto you which is immeasurably unfair. You are an extremely strong and accomplished young woman who should feel pride in herself, and in no way deserves to be abused by those who should be your built in support system. If I was in your predicament I would try to earn money in any way possible and save up until you can move away from your brother ASAP. I would also cut contact with my family because regardless of blood relation, there is no obligation for you to expend your energy on their bullshit. You're better than them.

I say it with utmost honestly and genuine concern for your wellbeing when I say it does get better. Realizing your own self worth and giving yourself the respect you deserve is a difficult journey but give yourself some time and be patient and kind to yourself. It's so worth it.

CannabisExtracts,fl0fy4v,t1_fl07iek,1584705088.0,"Im in the field of  metalwork and you absolutely need to take adequate precautions when possibly exposing yourself to particle or fume inhalation. We're required to wear respirators and face masks when we weld or cut a type of metal in a way that will produce metal dust or release dangerous fumes. Microabrasions on your lungs will develop scar tissue and any particles will be lodged in your brochioles and alveoli and can't come back out. Same with carbon fibre and fibreglass. 

So particles alone are an issue, and with corrosion (rust) already occurring, it's not smart to use a rig like this, especially since continuous high heat like this will just accelerate corrosion. Especially if this is going straight into your lungs though a tube. At the workplace we wear respirators even if the surrounding air is contaminated, let alone direct inhalation.
