Use your time efficiently, when I am stressed I tend to skip lectures as I usually feel I can learn faster by reading (but not better). Always know the content before doing the practical work, I have wasted a lot on time on submissions which could have gone faster if I went through the material properly at the beginning rather than piece wise as I got stuck on the assignment. You can't always do everything, it is often unrealistic to read everything and do every suggested exercise therefore you need to learn how to prioritise.

On the motivation front it is hard, when there is too much to do we tend to not want to do anything. Try to always remember why you are doing this, which might help when times are hard. And designate rest time where you don't have to worry about school so that you can recharge your batteries."
