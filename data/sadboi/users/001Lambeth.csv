They were prescribed for ocd and depression.  Citalopram made me sleepy all the time, just wanted to sleep very often.
Mirtazipine gave me a weird feeling in the legs, i guess i experienced restless leg syndrome if i am not mistaken.

How are things on the experimental Sertraline dose?

Thx"

Yes, i know what you are saying about the mounting , i should maybe start doing it, i just need to refresh my knowledge about the  mounting because i have limited experience when it comes to mounting
I assume you use a wallscanner?
Have you ever hit a water pipe or elec cable?"
TaskRabbit,f4x6tik,t1_f4vmnq2,1571862968.0,"Thx for the info mate, appreciate it.
I currently don't do mounting because if you want to do it properly it takes time and a lot of people want the assembling done as quick as possible and don't want to spend too much money.
I think i am going to stick to the normal Assembling category as i have been doing since the end of August.
I also don't like to rush unnecessary and am reasonably thorough."

Hello, interesting to hear about this.
If i remember correctly, in the past i have read that in some cases that psychiatrists do prescribe more then 200mg.
I have ocd and take 150 mg Sertraline.  Sertraline helps me function but still struggle with ocd, way too much for my liking.  
I have tried a a few other ssri's but went back to Sertraline because it works better for me.
I also have been thinking  about the 200mg plus dosage for my ocd, might speak to my gp about this in the future.
And another thing is the Sertraline definitely doesn't work that well as it did in the beginning.
I have been on it for about 6 years.
It gave me more motivation and energy and think it worked a bit better for the ocd, so that might be another reason to go beyond 200mg.
So this thing you are mentioning is food for thought for me.
The only problem i am thinking of is the sexual side effects on these 200 above dosages.

On what dosage Sertraline are you on?"
TaskRabbit,f4fzqfg,t1_f4e8fo0,1571576117.0,"Yes, thx for the comprehensive answer.  So i assume there is plenty of work for you with the Ikea assembling?

Do you also the mount the the wardrobes,
I assume it's compulsory if you work with the Ikea assembling program?

I personally don't do the mounting because it's risky drilling into walls and some people want the assembling dome asap because they are on a budget.  
If you do the mounting properly it takes  extra time.
Yes, i have some experience but don't rush, try to do it properly.
I wouldn't say i am quick but haven't really compared myself to other taskers, but i think some products can be  time consuming when assambling.
I have been doing assembling for about 2 months, do it on the hourly rate."

People apparently feel normal again after a month/2 months i've read.
But if you feel bad for too long and cannot function then you will have to make some kind of choice.  
If you are mentally suffering for months then it's not worth it, then it's just better to be on medication i think.
How long have you been off Sertraline?"
depression,f1qkl2q,t3_dak03f,1569702557.0,"Sorry to hear that you are currently suffering.
I tried once to get off Sertraline after being on 150mg-200 mg for about 3-4 years and it was hell.  It was sort of waking up to a bad dream, could barely function.
Had no choice but to go back on them.  Once i was back on them, took a while to work again and reach a higher dose i was ok again.
I am still on it, 150 mg for depression and ocd.
Seems  to be a big problem for some people trying to get off ssri's.
I tried amino acids like Tryptophan, 5 htp, L-tyrosine to help with the Withdrawal symptoms and as a alternative to a ssri, but they did not work."
