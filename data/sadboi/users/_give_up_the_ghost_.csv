Codependency,fdj9n0g,t3_elapzh,1578462489.0,"I have to politely disagree with the idea that love has to become routine as it matures. Yes, there are elements of a relationship that become routine but if you don't let the fire go too dim or go out all together, if you both work the billows 100/100 to keep the flames fanned, then the passion CAN remain for a lifetime.

I do like the poem but it makes me sad too. It makes me sad because I'll likely never find that. Even though that's what I want and that's what the author wants (or her fictional character), to find a partner like that, one that passionately loves me just as much as I would love them, with nothing standing the way, is a very rare thing indeed.  There's so many variables and elements and conditions, etc. etc. that are involved in a romantic relationship in this day and age."
Codependency,fdj82h5,t3_elnunj,1578461113.0,Take some time for yourself and enjoy your freedom.
Codependency,fdj5mxw,t3_elfrux,1578459113.0,That was beautiful. I'm glad you're getting though it and making strides to make the necessary changes in yourself that you need to for your future happiness with yourself and in your future. Hang in there.
depression,fd7uvkw,t1_fd6otic,1578210481.0,I'm sorry that you're being treated that way. Your story makes me sad. I hope he comes out of it and starts appreciating your more and wanting you to be more apart of each others lives if that's what's meant to be.
depression,fd6q5vo,t1_fd6ml9e,1578194371.0,Despite everything she's done to me I still struggle everyday thinking about her. 8 years with her and I've learned that I'm totally codependent with her. I knew I could never quit her or other things I was doing that was killing me physically and emotionally so I moved across the country not knowing anyone here where I'm at and have found a great recovery community here and I've been clean from Sarah and the other things I was addicted to for 51 days now. Thank you for your support and your kind words.
depression,fd64uyi,t3_ek3uky,1578185554.0,"Similar thing happened to me. We were just married too. She started pulling away from me and talking to this younger dude at her work. I found out and over the next three months fell into the worst depression of my life. I went to Vanderbilt's psych hospital for ten days at the end of it because I got to where I was literally at the end of my rope. I found out later on she was fucking that guy as soon as I went to the hospital. I found that out about two months later. Realistically, she was probably fucking around before then even, that's just what she finally admitted to me was when I was in the hospital. Anyway, please don't take her back is she tries to get back with you.  I separated from her immediately after I found out and then she begged me to forgive her and take her back and so I did and five years later, just two months ago, I found out she's been cheating on my again for a while with another younger dude. It's been so hard but I've cut myself off from her completely because apparently she'll never change despite the fact she claims she loves me but 'just has a problem'. Anyway, I'm rambling. It's going to be tough but at the end of the day she didn't care enough about you to keep her legs closed in your time of need and also your 'friend' is an even bigger piece of shit and I'd cut him off too. Eventually you'll forgive them, hopefully, but you'll never forget. I'm sorry you're going through this."

Drugs,fcavmnn,t1_fcavcc8,1577577498.0,It has the same chemical formula as d-methamp and always looks like prefect shards. Too perfect almost. Just makes you feel weird and even sick is your do too much of it. I've been burnt with it a couple of times then learned what to look for and never again. That's also msm which is easier to get. You have to order n-iso from the internet.

depression,fc6shyu,t1_fc6s616,1577488357.0,"All you can do is try to talk to her about it. Be completely honest and apologize, then if she doesn't accept it or still wants nothing to do with a relationship with you, then you'll just have to accept it and move on as difficult and as painful as that may be. If that's the case then it too shall pass."
depression,fc6qidf,t3_eghyoy,1577486923.0,I'm sorry bro. I know that pain well. Rejection hurts no matter what. Sounds like a little self sabotage to me. Like maybe you feel like you don't deserve to be wanted/loved/liked by someone. When you say meds do you mean illegal substances or prescription psych meds?
Drugs,fc6q6sb,t3_eghou0,1577486696.0,Bruh that sounds like a killer fucking idea!
Drugs,fc6pwr0,t3_egei1p,1577486500.0,I'd take 2g for a mild first trip. 1g just isn't enough. 3.5g if you really want to experience what it's all about. Remember set and setting is very important. Also remember if things get a little too heavy just keep reminding yourself that you will come back to your normal self and thinking in a few hours. Have a good trip.
Codependency,fc6l8fl,t1_fc6hwys,1577483220.0,"That's a perfect analogy and so true. She is definitely like a powerful drug to me and just like a powerfully addictive drug, it's so hard to quit her. But finally after almost 9 years I realize how much more the consequences greatly out way the benefits of being in a relationship with her. I just wish I could've been strong enough to do this so much sooner and saved myself some years and a lot of heartache. Thank you for sharing."

alcoholicsanonymous,fc1k7ur,t3_effec3,1577321236.0,I've got 40 days today. My first sober Christmas in 26 years myself. Thanks for the share!
Drugs,fbqwu12,t1_fbqwf5n,1577036551.0,Lol. Ok I wasn't sure. Sorry for assuming bro.
Drugs,fbqwpx1,t1_fbqw55v,1577036514.0,You can also use a pediegg or Dremel to powder it up the best you can and then swallow it. It does overcome the time release by exponentially expanding the surface area of the pill.
Drugs,fbqw55v,t3_ee7chl,1577036328.0,Oxycodone has a higher bioavailability when ingested orally vs insufflated which has a lower bioavailability. I think sticking a time release pill up your ass would just be an uncomfortable waste of your time and pill.
electronicmusic,fbqi8ne,t3_ee32v2,1577031965.0,I don't think the guys commenting that it needs bass and drums understand what you were going for. You did a nice job for using a phone app but it is lacking some kind of depth or variance that really gets that hook in and makes me want to listen again and again. I like your moniker. I noticed you have a few songs posted. Do you have a personal favorite that you've done so far?
alcoholicsanonymous,fbc8gd2,t3_ecjurh,1576718173.0,If you have a suspicion then bring it to the attention of just one other member of the house and it just takes two house members to confront the suspicious party and request an on the spot test. There are no house managers at an Oxford House.
depression,fbc7qju,t3_eckidz,1576717682.0,"I feel for you, brother. I've been there before and I'm there now. I'm two marriages down the tubes and like one person above stated, I did lose everything else too because of them plus acquired a serious substance abuse and other mood disorders because of it. After it happened the second time with my second marriage, I became severely depressed and didn't know how to keep living anymore. My happiness was gone and I never thought I would be happy ever again. I'm still trying to get over that relationship but things ARE better for me now. I still love her but I know we can never be together again. She betrayed me so badly and totally blindsided me while all the while convincing me she loved me too and was just as happy as I was in our relationship. The problem isn't me, it isn't you. The problem lies within the unfaithful person. Some people no matter how much they think they love someone there's something inside them that is broken and causes them to do the things they do. I know it doesn't seem like it now but you are better off. Only time can heal this my friend, as well as keeping occupied with healthy activities and even therapy or a group like codependents anonymous can help immensely. My overall point is the better you can make yourself as a person, the better you will attract a woman that isn't fucked up and will tell you she loves you one week and is leaving your for another woman the next. Take care man and just remember it well get better."
alcoholicsanonymous,fb8eisx,t1_fb8eexz,1576612177.0,I think that definitely counts though. Congrats on your sobriety. Keep coming back.
alcoholicsanonymous,fb8e583,t3_ebypeb,1576611948.0,Those are actually good for your recovery man. It's called a DAMT (dreams of absent minded transgessions) in psychology and it's a sign that your consciously and subconsciously working though it but I believe that's only if you feel guilty about it while in the dream and then relieved that you didn't use or drink when you wake up and realize you didn't actually drink or use.
depression,fb57knm,t3_ebeok0,1576522471.0,I can relate. I have a low baseline in general so I'm always melancholy but whenever stuff is going well in my life I tend to feel better and when things aren't I tend to slip deeper into depression so I think that I have mdd as well as situational depression too and it sounds like you may be the same with what you described. Thank you for sharing. Good luck with your interview.

Drugs,eyxc2l1,t3_cz6xkv,1567549629.0,"Walk....just start walking if your able to do so. Try not to think about things too much.  If you have to walk 10 fucking miles in the hot September sun then so be it.  I have anxiety problems too, especially when I'm trying to get clean and can't self-medicate the anxiety away with whatever I'm getting off of.  I find that walking, and then when you're in better physical shape, working out aerobically esp. takes the anxiety away.  Just exhaust yourself.  It releases natural endorphins as well as returns your brain chemistry back to homeostasis exponentially faster than just sitting on the couch future tripping or dwelling on the past.  So  walking is just about thew easiest thing one can do to get this process going and once it gets going you'll notice the results almost immediately.  Drugs, especially the ones designed by pharmacologists working for big pharma expressly for anxiety, i.e. all the benzodiazapenes, only serve to fuck your brain chemistry up even more, a lot more and you'll find the rebound anxiety you get when you have to come off the valium, xanax, ativan or whatever poison it is, will be so much worse than it was before you started taking that shit.  I know all this from experience, so this is only my thoughts on the matter but I think the addictin and neurochemistry aspect of it is well established so it's not just my opinion.  I wish you the best, OP and you CAN conquer this naturally if you want to."
Drugs,eyt3mvo,t3_cyelld,1567423452.0,"Parachute (eat) a quarter g of ice (a tenth of you have no tolerance), insufflate a bump or two of Heroin and proceed to give your gal (or dude if that's your style, but you guys probably already know all this) multiple orgasms for the next two hours or so (and you'll relish in every fuckin second of it) and if and when you finally climax, be prepared to have a two minute, mind blowing, wake all the neighbors in your building, orgasm. An orgasm that of which you've never had the likes of before. The only downside is you'll never want to have regular ole boring, two minute sex again. The upside is you just worked out for two hours so it's a win fuckin win! My theory is, the ice keeps you erect like Viagra and the heroin keeps you from busting too soon. Too much or too little of one thing or the other and the balance is off and you'll get mixed results. Stay awesome, my friends."
