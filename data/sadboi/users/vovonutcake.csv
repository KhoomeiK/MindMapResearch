AMA,fonxzx8,t3_g77mr2,1587928692.0,"Firstly, I'm sorry that you have to go through this. M not gonna lie, my parents don't take my mental health all that serious either. I'm supposed to take pills every 12 hours and so it would intervene w fasting. Plus my neurologist said I shouldn't be fasting . But my family is like...so what just take the pills a little bit later. They're mood stabilizers ....so when I take them makes all the difference. Point being, some cultures make Islam harder when Allah has made it easier..I shouldn't be fasting but I feel like I have to. I used to not pray when I was stoned bcz of all the scholars saying ""haRRRAMM"" but then my mom showed me the verse in the Quran regarding intoxication n prayer and I concluded that I can ,indeed pray when I I'm high. Weed helps more with my mental health more than any other prescribed meds. So I use it often but that meant I was missing prayers so I decided to ditch what the scholars said and asked Allah directly and found my answer. 
I'm South Asian so we believe the same thing. Doubt is from the devil. Except, prophet Mohammed doubted his first encounter with the Divine and thought he was crazy! Humans are curious beings...Allah made us that way! How can we learn if we don't ask questions? How can we even BELIEVE if we don't have doubt and confusion? I believe questioning is an integral part of faith because it makes you question. I cannot tell you How Much I've benefitted thru questioning. Don't let any Muslim tell you otherwise. 
As for homosexuality, I'm sorry I cannot offer anything but my support and well wishes. I cannot even begin to imagine how hard and anxeity provoking that must be. 
Best of Luck."
