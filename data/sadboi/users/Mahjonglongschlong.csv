Try applying the watco to a a piece of glass and see how it dries, if it dries to be sandable without being gummy in 2 hours at 75 degree, then you have an issue with what's beneath.  Keep in mind I am considering the Watco to be a fresh container, not 2-3 years old (or older)."

Wood porosity will vary, especially with soft woods like cedar and redwood.  You can live with it, and eventually it will fade enough for a fresh application, or you can strip, clean and brighten the wood, then re-apply the stain."
