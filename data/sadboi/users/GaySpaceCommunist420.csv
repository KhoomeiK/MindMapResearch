I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I ocassionaly drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Althought, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."

When you get PTSD, something that is quite common (and which has happened to me) is that you very much want your circumstances to never be repeated. From experiences since my original trauma, I have come to believe that the values of the average American are extremely ignorant, backwards and unempathetic, and it is completely inevitable that more people will end up getting fucked over the same way I have because of the way we act in our society.

Deaths of dispair, child abuse, sex trafficking, domestic violence, rapes gone unprevented and unpunished are all completely avoidable things if the average person had any fucking empathy or courage. Yet they are epidemic in our society. Given how obviously avoidable these things are and how common they are, it has to be the case that hundreds of millions of people in this country are not willing to lift a finger to help the less fortunate. The fact that so many people can sleep at night and go about their lives and get treated as good people, while having committed one of these heinous acts or failed to prevent them, makes me assume everyone around me is untrustworthy and a terrible person by default. 

I guess the silver lining is that these problems tend to improve over time (i highly reccomend reading Steven Pinker's *the better angels of our nature* on the subject of declining violence over time), but still, the average person in the part of society that I grew up in is a bad person, I believe"
