summonerschool,fr21x9h,t3_fej80u,1589829747.0,"If the score is 35 to 5 and I have all kills in team, I sure hope my team will press yes. Who fcking cares if its winnable if 20% of the time ill just waste 20 more minutes of my life losing most of time. Id MUCH rather lose lp and queue again. Apes that never ff are unbelievable toxic towards an improvement mentality. Who cares if game is maybe winnable by some miracle? After 15mins you aren’t learning anything meaningful by playing. Enjoy your 20/80 coinflip lp and 20mins time wasted you could have spent getting better by queuing up again."

AskPhysics,fi3u6ip,t3_f650t8,1582127728.0,"Interest leads to skill no the other way around. If you learn about math/physics in the context of planets, I'm sure that you will become better as a result of interest. I used to have really bad math grades, but because I study physics on my own out of interest, I learned the math through the physics without even thinking about it. If you keep working on the more mathy side of Astrophysics/Astronomy, you will see if you like it. You definitely should try to practice physics & math, especially because the material will only build. Khan Academy is actually good until Calc 2, so be sure to do all of that for review/preview. If you learn material ahead of time, it is much easier to do well in classes, ESPECIALLY if those are your weak points. None of it is necessarily difficult, its just different. Once you adapt to thinking in a new way, it will get way easier. If you believe in yourself and diligently practice, you 100% can get that degree."
