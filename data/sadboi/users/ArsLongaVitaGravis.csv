Settebello is a new one if you fancy Italian stone-baked pizza. Relatively cheap and plentiful if you order for pick-up on their own site. A lot like Fat Toni's offering (RIP) but a bit more affordable. Just Eat adds a stupid premium plus delivery fee.

Zanzibraai if you like kebabs but... better.

Avoid Food Junction and King's Corner. Absolutely abysmal for what they are (cheap kebabs/burgers/chicken) and they've both had run-ins with the hygiene inspector in the recent past. You reckon it wouldn't be that difficult...

Anxiety,fi1xzd8,t3_f6016a,1582067120.0,"I found myself doing this all too often many years ago.

I realised that even if I did gain the absolute praise of my peers, I wouldn't necessarily be any happier. This may well be different for you but even so you should try to circumvent the triggers and refocus on what makes you proud to be yourself rather than letting your mind look to others for validation of the self.

Ultimately the reformation of these negative habits take time and are best eased along by cognitive behavioural therapy or a similar therapeutic method aimed at tackling the cognitive link between anxiety and its triggers.
