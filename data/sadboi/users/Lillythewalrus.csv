However, food sensitivity issues can be prevalent in many disorders (adhd, asd) or can be a result of certain developmental issues, so I don‚Äôt think you should be so harsh with her. Her pickiness probably makes her own life hell as well and I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs aware it can irritate people.  Try to reach some kind of compromise where you can find shared meals you both enjoy and alternate making individual meals together. 

Also, if she‚Äôs interested in trying to fix some of her food issues, cognitive behavioral therapy can sometimes help people move past some of their ‚Äúdislikes‚Äù that may stem from fear/anxiety of eating said thing."

eldertrees,fop6mxf,t3_g8bq4p,1587954249.0,"Just by reading this post it seems like you may have some anxious tendencies regardless of your use. Especially during these crazy times, anxiety and uncertainty can sneak its way into your subconscious without you being fully aware of it. Even if things are going well for you and you feel okay (which is great to hear!), the state of the world and the scary things you hear about daily can still take hold. The main thing I learned when I started experiencing anxiety while high is that there‚Äôs a way to walk yourself out of it. Fearing the paranoia that may come from smoking makes it more likely to come. When you do start to feel off, create a routine for yourself to pull your mind out of it. For me, I say in my head that I know I am fine, that this is just a side effect and is normal and not to worry, and I distract myself with something physical like cleaning or playing music. If it‚Äôs severe, it‚Äôs always okay to take a break and try again in a couple months, but lowering your tolerance and having doubts when you try again could lead to it being worse so be careful! Try to have a good mindset about possibly experiencing anxiety before you smoke"

SULeaks,fin6tl1,t3_f8sfdw,1582557142.0,"So, as stressed by the cym, Steven literally exists as a fusion. His gem self, and his human self. And as we‚Äôve seen with garnet and bluebird, when a fusion is unstable they can often separate. I do think worm boy is steven,  but I think it is only his gem side. All this emotional turmoil he is feeling will cause him to split, and his gem self will manifest into the monster in the opening. I‚Äôm thinking sometime shortly after the failed proposal with connie, Steven will officially lose his grip on himself and unfuse. Since Steven cannot really survive without his gem self, I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôll either be too out of it to fight, or have to fuse with connie or someone else to keep going. That would explain the animation leak where everyone is running, because I am pretty sure stevonnie is riding lion in the center. Also - I think the worm monster is going to have some ability to ‚Äúturn people pink‚Äù with those laser eyes. Much like white, pink‚Äôs magic seems to manipulate emotions. So I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs possible that the pink white from the intro is the result of a direct hit from the worm boy. Who knows, at this point I think the worm has to at least be somewhat connected to Steven. The show hasn‚Äôt shown us literal corruption through emotion before, but it has shown us how bad emotions can affect a fusion, and Steven exists as a fusion 24/7.

I think the worm boy will end up playing out similar to cactus steven, everyone fights it only for steven to realize that he has to face the inside problems that have caused this if he wants to solve anything. Worm boy will be defeated and steven will refuse as a whole. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be left with corruption scars because he has not been corrupted in the same sense that we‚Äôve previously seen. However he may be left with a pink eye (heheh) because there has been a lot of one eye symbolism this season. He‚Äôll realize how different he really is now and understand that he has to do something to begin figuring out who he wants to be, and how to heal from all the fucked up things that have happened to him. I think the series will end with him leaving beach city (seems pretty obvious since day one with the end credits) but I am pretty sure it will be a good decision that everyone supports, not him leaving without a trace. I am hoping this will all wrap up by the second to last episode, and that the final is another time skip to several years in the future, where he is probably with connie, doing something musical, and looks happy. I‚Äôll be content if the series just ends with him leaving, but I‚Äôm really holding out for him getting his happy ending. Poor boy has just been through too much."

NetflixSexEducation,fghnw0l,t3_eyk3he,1580789189.0,"‚ÄúFor my german expressionism painting, I wanted to reverse the view that many german painters had of women. In class we reviewed a handful of paintings that portrayed women as sinful, ill natured beings; or were simply only portrayed with the male viewer‚Äôs perception in mind. I created a scene of paranoia, a woman who has experienced sexual abuse before walking home at night with a man walking behind her. My intention was not to portray a scene moments before an attack, but how one‚Äôs perception on the world around them is mutated into something scary after experiencing trauma. Similar to the german expressionism paintings we received in class, I wanted a large portion of this painting where the man is coming from to be murky and dark. This is harshly contrasted with the bright yellow ground plane, acting like a spotlight to show how much attention the woman is paying now to her surroundings. I used my brushstrokes to create a warped spiral effect, connecting the woman and the man together despite them not interacting. I wanted to represent how assault victims are followed by the presence of what has happened to them, and the inability to break the connection between the person responsible and any random person they may encounter. I chose to keep her eyes covered to express this point further, that she is not able to see the world normally anymore. I brought traces of the dark background colors onto the woman in vague hand shapes to portray physical signs of the memories that are fueling her paranoia. Lastly, and on a more positive note, I placed clean, bright colors in the corner of the painting where she is walking towards. Though she may still look back often, she is moving away from the dread that lays behind her.‚Äù"
