addiction,fpuxuro,t3_gfmduv,1588927573.0,"i would say your sleep problems aren't connected direktly to quitting weed
your dose was realativly low and didn't smoked everyday and this only for 5 month
the 'sideffekts' should normaly get away within a few days

i quit a week ago because of an op, and smoke everyday a little bit for a few weeks, with short breaka, and at the weekend 'a little bit' more and have almost no sideeffekts now, only in the first few days

but sleeping is hard for me to, because of severeale mental conditions and mainly because of a high level of histamin 
so for me its like i had to take a break of my medicine

so maybe its connected with your mental health, keep an eye on your emotions and thoughts
and if nothing helps, see a doctor about it

sorry not an real solve or answer to your problem, but maybe it will kind of help you :)"
