Meaning masks should be one time use, taken off in a particular method and considering that hand used to be dirty and needs to be cleaned. 
My concern is people not trained in this and using the same mask, touching it, balling it up after touching things at the store and eventually reusing it. It seems the probability of contaminating a mask is high and sticking right back on your nose is not good. Some doctors in my field agree 100% about this. But of course the thought is it prevents contaminated people from spreading it. But even for effective protection of the user it needs be N95 type sealed and fit tested for size."
