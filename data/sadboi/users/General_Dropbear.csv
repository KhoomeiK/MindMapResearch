But if using Averland sunset a black spray would be best, which is what I use for my vehicles. 

With thinning paints while what you explain may not sounds like it’s 50:50 it works well enough from my experience. Though you could thin it done further if you feel it would be better for you. 

Since Valrak method is no longer valid anymore due to games workshop both getting rid of the averland spray and glaze the first option might be the best. Though a replacement for the averland spray could be done with and air spray and a replacement for the glaze can be achieved with  Vallejo Game Ink AMARILLO YELLOW. The method with the ink to turn it into a glaze is to get an eye dropper and for every drop of ink you drop, you drop 2 drops of water. This has been my best experience in copying the glaze."
