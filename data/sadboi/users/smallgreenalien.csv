That question is thrown around so casually and carelessly and often by people who just want the shallow answer. Don't ask if you don't REALLY want to know, bc I won't lie. It might not be pretty and you probanly won't know what to respond.
I usually just say something general like ""getting by"" and turn the focus on them."

I think no matter why you're doing it, releasing trapped emotions happens as a matter of course. In one of his videos where he's teaching a group the breathing (maybe the Yes Theory video?) A guy has what looks like a mild seizure during the exercise and doesn't remember it. From my personal experience and that of others, this is what releasing trauma sometimes looks like. One time after the exercises I had something like this and even spoke some gibberish, my heartbeat felt like it was resetting and I was slipping in and out of different dimensions while having a small ""seizure"". I also had a vision. Very powerful experience. I thought my mom was in the kitchen making blueberry pancakes and she came in my room and asked if I was ok and covered me with a blanket (none of that happened). I definitely felt lighter when I came to."

They just got all new blends though due to the lockdown in Peru where they got the old ones so I can't recommend any specific ones from there at this moment. Just ordered some new ones. It's a blend of mapacho (South American tobacco, which is much stronger than ours here) and different herbs/barks/etc (depending on desired benefit). They are finely ground into a powder you blow into your nostrils with a tool called a kuripe. It burns, and sometimes it can make you ""purge"" (puke) which is scary for some people. I won't cut corners with honesty lol. It's a traditional tribal medicine for clearing negative energies. It instantly zaps me into the here and now (it can be a great aid to meditation). I can link you to an article maybe but I am new to reddit and am not sure how to do that. 

This medicine isn't for everyone. I happen to have been a massage therapist who was also into the world of spirituality/energy work/ the healing properties of psychedelics/herbs etc. I have had such horrible issues and that world was already open to me (and traditional ways had failed) so naturally I looked to my alternatives. I'm not cured but I am stubborn as hell and bitter about my past. I know I could be further along if I had made more commitment. My alternatives have kept me alive at least, through my stubborn efforts at not being here. 
Plenty of people will argue against my methods saying they are dangerous, etc. Desperate times call for desperate measures though. What can I say lol. I don't play by the rules most play by, if I did I'd be dead. Anyway, that's my disclaimer ;)

Cold showers or baths, exposure to cold in general. Meditation if you can (yoga and cold exposure put you in the mode for that). I also have a little hack I use for instant grounding. It's a South American tobacco/herb snuff called rapé (pronounced hapay). It has been a miracle and saved my damn life. It feels like my soul is always trying to escape my body and my whole system is flipping shit. Oh yeah. Breathing exercises! Anything that snaps you back here into this moment. It's more complicated and difficult than it sounds to be right here right now and not thinking or feeling anything unnecessary. A cold shower will show you quick what that is like. You don't have energy to feel sorry for yourself or be anxious because all you can do is focus on surviving. There is also plenty of research on the benefits of that. Look up the Wim Hof method. It has gotten people off their depression and anxiety meds. Good luck!"

EatingDisorders,foqfeeo,t3_g8xug0,1587992257.0,"Goodness gracious this was enlightening. I'm having the same experience. It's a bit different for me since I have health issues and eating any solids makes my body react badly. Major digestive issues they couldn't diagnose. Even small amounts of healthy foods that look perfectly normal to others make my body react and cause extreme bloating and discomfort. I eat to self harm sometimes bc I am so frustrated with my body, but it doesn't ""look"" like self harm to anyone else. I've realized the core is mother issues and lack of a father as well (ironically this condition has landed me living with her and even sleeping in her bed bc I don't have my own room) Thankfully she's a different person now but I still have to let go of the trauma she caused me in my earlier years. I need to ""parent"" myself and use self control to heal but my mother was super angry and controlling so I resist/rebel against my own self control mechanisms. Your triggers sound like mine, I just hadn't been able to articulate them to that extent. Thank you for this post. Just reading it has helped me understand myself a lot better. Before a ""binge"" I feel frantic. I don't always throw up but I have to take a lot of laxatives to get things to exit. I suspect ""holding onto"" my feelings and not letting myself feel them has caused that. My whole front torso feels rather disconnected feom me and numb, and I have pressure in my solar plexus area that makes breathing odd and difficult. Like lifting a weight, so even breathing causes major anxiety. It's funny how emotional issues manifest in our physical body symptoms. Yoga has helped me a lot. Cold showers. Breathing exercises. Being out in nature and getting sun. Trying to express creativity in whatever way I can, even if I don't ""enjoy"" it or don't feel like it. I can't draw well so I've been making collages. Juicing has helped me stay alive as well. There's something called ""rapé"" (pronounced ""hapay"") which is a tribal medicine and it is very grounding and has saved my life. I'm still working on feeling my feelings. If I can cry I usually feel relief afterward. I feel clarity for a bit instead of being foggy and anxious/irritable/numb. I just want to feel like myself but like you, when I do feel it is usually negative and scary af. I've had panic attacks where I almost passed out. I think my soul is having trouble staying in this body bc I have been so miserable (I'm rather spiritual, hence my language). People report having out of body experiences during particularly traumatic situations and that's what it felt like was going to happen. I somehow held on and hyperventilated until the anxiety meds kicked in. Anxiety meds have helped me TONS to think more clearly and slow my brain down. I have to have a plan though so I don't sabotage myself. They make me feel rather ""normal"" mentally and emotionally so it's easy to just go eat something I immediately regret because my body still reacts the same. My family has to hide food and it has been a huge strain on them in so many ways. I've been watching vids about multiple personality disorder and I don't think I have it, but I kind of identify with the dynamic. It feels like there are two sides of me fighting for control. One is a perfectionist (thanks mom) and the other wants to self sabotage out of pain (it finds comfort in self destruction somehow). Food offers a few minutes of pleasure I can't find elsewhere, bc like you, I don't find joy in anything or ""feel"" love. I'm trying so hard to balance between them and find a middle ground. I miss ""me"". ""Me"" was a cool person.
If I think of anything else I will post again. Sorry to be so long winded. Keep going. It's all we can do. 
Oh yeah, it also helps me to make gratitude lists and watch videos of people who overcame seemingly impossible situations. People who have lost limbs and shit and still actualized themselves. It makes me feel that if they can do it, so can I. After all, I still have my arms and legs!!!
