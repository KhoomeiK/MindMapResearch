MusicInTheMaking,fp71pu4,t3_gbocbk,1588362451.0,"Okay i just went a listened to the whole album
Gotta say i like the idea
Good produced tracks but they all something common that isnt really a good thing
They all have too strong reverb on the vocals and in the snares
The treble sounds faded and it makes it sound less impactful
The lyrics and vocals are well done, it sounds very good
Add treble on the vocals next time
Just a little to make them sound brighter
Drums should sound louder, off course with correlation to the whole mix
Not too loud or too low
Longer songs would be amazing!
I would rate your album a 7/10
It sounds good but it could improve a lot!
Well done
I could get them on spotify if youd like, just contact me"

Sorry i read it wrong :("
musicians,fo31zpn,t1_fo30zsl,1587479015.0,"Well i just listened to it and got some findings
1- The Treble for her voice was mixed with at least 5dB- which makes it sound a little muffled when listened with low volume or half volume of any speaker/headphone
2-the small vocal runs are performed well but the little tails of them seen to get a bit out of pitched
3- the Snare of the drums seems to be low in treble as well but its not as bad as in the vocals because its just the rhythm pacer
Vocals Are supposed bright(a melody’s purpose is to be bright, which means more treble)
4- the kick of the drums its good but doesnt have the enough volume to make ground in the mix, it sounds like an addon instead of the rhythm keeper
After all of this, i think its pretty good
I like the jazzy loose melody she used its great and really keeps the music energy on hold
Any other advice you guys would like just a text would be sufficient
Thank you!"

If you aspire to be a singer you will need to start with the easiest way
Record yourself singing to the camera and share it, usually with youtube if you want
Thats how i started
If you dont have any instruments then yes a Workstation would be great
If you have an Iphone i recommend Garageband
If you have android i recommend bandlab or walkband
Good luck with your career!"
