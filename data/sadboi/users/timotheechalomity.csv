BPD,fqgq334,t3_gia8ni,1589353458.0,"Hi,

It sounds like you had a really strong bond with this teacher and I hate that we can automatically assume the worst... but I’m glad you found help at some point from her and I’m sorry you’ve lost that connection. All I can say is I hope you find new ways to cope and that an educator’s job is to support their students sustainably — theres a tipping point for everyone, including them, and it’s not necessarily your fault. Maybe she had other issues going on and can’t handle providing that extra support. Who knows. Either way I hope you get through this 🤍

Also side note: teachers are required by law (at least in California) to report any dangers they might see among their students. Of course what you talk about will be confidential but I sincerely hope your teacher has your best interests in mind when considering this. She might be pushing you to talk to a therapist instead because she may not want to overstep. If you are in serious harm to yourself please reach out to a hotline or even to her again, and id really hope she does the right thing."

BPD,fp4lwec,t3_gba1ee,1588301927.0,"i relate to these feelings of ending up alone too and I’m struggling on how to get past them myself. it’s so hard to focus on ourselves because it’s probably easier to fixate on others and think that they’ll fix us — soooo much easier. :( I hope you do take some time for yourself though, and be kind... I tell myself that my greatest love story will be the one about me loving myself; not some other person who can’t and shouldn’t be held up to that expectation of “completing” me"
depression,fnnzpf6,t3_g2trfg,1587106904.0,"there will be so many resources and people to help you out in college. It’s the first place I got help myself for depression & anxiety. There are communities of people out there waiting for you and wanting to help you. your mom doesn’t define you & your achievements & whether you fail or not. I know sometimes that’s tough to believe and accept and that’s ok. take things at your own pace but be kind & gentle to yourself as much as you can. again you won’t be alone when you graduate and go to college. you’ll find your people and your place. it might get hard but there’s so much waiting for you there. 

let me know if you need anyone to talk to, I am here"
