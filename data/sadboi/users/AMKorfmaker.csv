formula1,ff8ry9t,t1_ff8rpyi,1579693726.0,"Im not sure if i am correct but ill try.

on throttle there is huge amount of gasses comming out of the exhaust and over the diffuser, creating more downforce. Off throttle you will lose that. So with the blown diffuser they keep injecting fuel in the engine OFF throttle and NOT ignite it in the engine, because you dont wont to accelerate. So the rich mixture gets into the exhaust en explodes inside the exhaust due to high temperatures there creating a high pressure flow over the diffuser thus creating downforce.

So the noise is what I think the combustion of a fuel mixture inside the exhaust."

Instead of focusing on things you cant do and see everything negative, look at things you can do. If you cant stand for 30minutes, maybe you can look for work where you can sit. If you want to learn more math or anything for that matter, just do it. No one is stopping you from learning or doing things but yourself. There is tons of information on the internet. I'm self taught in a lot of stuff. Look on youtube for example for how to's and lessons. Also wikipedia is great for information runs.  


Further you should look for professional help. Only if you can talk with someone once per month would make a huge difference. I know from experience they can give you huge amounts of insights and show you things you would never have tought of. Most of our thinking patterns are negative but false."
