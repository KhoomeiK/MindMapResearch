You look down on me, be thankful, move on forward.

Lots of love. ðŸ’š"

And you're in a better state. Believe me.:("
BPD,fpnee5e,t3_gegxsz,1588759994.0,"Have you tried Mindfulness yet?
In some cases, Marijuana helps too.
For me, it has been an escape since a long time.
Also, whenever I have such feelings, I just go and sit with someone else. NOT alone.
Just make sure that whenever you're about to do something that sort, just go where there are people. 
I just go to my parents, or friends. 

If you live alone, I once did.
I had a sticker on everything that could've harmed me.
It read "" throw me away. Count to 10. Take a drag. """
BPD,fpll559,t1_fpjk6mr,1588714681.0,"Hey there!

I was treated with Bipolar too. I wasn't satisfied with the diagnosis. No matter what they did, or said. I knew it was something else.
I went on for a third opinion and was diagnosed with BPD.
Everything made sense at that point.
The most contrasting difference between bipolar and BPD is the tenure for which your mood swings on manic episodes stays. In BPD, it is generally for a short span of time. Whereas in Bipolar, it can be there for days on end. 
If anything else, let me know!
Powers to you."
