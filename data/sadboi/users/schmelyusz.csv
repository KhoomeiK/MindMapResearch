AmItheAsshole,ez4gxdd,t3_czvpw6,1567686689.0,"Tbh I think you are NTA. The idea of the father of a family, or mother or parents being the responsible for their children alone seems too idealistic for me. In reality we live in systems that don't provide enough support to families and general income tends to be below the financial needs of multiple children. I understand how her claim in providing that support for influenced your thoughts with those problems and she basically tricked you and leaves you alone with the costs she PROMISED to cover. I think there is no shame in accepting support, even from a family member. So I understand your feelings towards her but I can't read from this post how your communications work irl"

I am so happy hearing that you spend your days at the hospital and how you give your brother comfort. I wish both of you the best and don't forget about yourself in this hard times."
AmItheAsshole,eybwcs3,t1_eybvjie,1566992924.0,Yeah agree it sucks. Thx for your time
AmItheAsshole,eybnr67,t1_eybngwy,1566988513.0,That's what he's been saying to me. It's true that he spent more time at my place but I just responded in the other comment why I dont like being there.
AmItheAsshole,eybnhx0,t1_eybn6z6,1566988361.0,Not mentioned in the post: he lives with his mom who has a problem with guests being there and i'm allergic to his cat so I admit I've been there less but it's not so comfortable
AmItheAsshole,eybnalu,t1_eybn6z6,1566988247.0,Yeah he is exaggerating lol
AmItheAsshole,eybn1m3,t1_eybl838,1566988112.0,"Your point is valid but how do you read that from my post? I have been very well invested in our relationship but when university and a full time job started, I had way less time than before."

surrealmemes,ew2jeyo,t1_ew2i8y6,1565048210.0,There's a guy in it who has black holes in his palms like some kind of superpower. And there are episodes in which he is attracting poisonous wasps. Random coincidence
surrealmemes,ew2i84b,t1_ew2eyvg,1565047352.0,Did you watch Inuyasha?
AmItheAsshole,ew1ew7l,t1_ew1e9zq,1565021926.0,"I've had another comment saying that they'd probably be happy to meet me. Tbh, yes I would have considered that. I didn't really think of the possibilty that they would care about me. That might sound odd. I admit that I didn't really think about their feelings and also your comment helps me validate them. I don't have any grand parents and my family was quite disfunctional. I still learn that other families do love and care for each other, but sadly it sometimes ends up in me not comprehending such simple concepts. Thanks for your comment."
AmItheAsshole,ew1dwxd,t1_ew1dfxr,1565021295.0,"Damn. I don't have any grandparents or sthg like a family life, but how did I not think of that? I feel really bad now. Really thank you, I didn't really consider his grandparents point of view and certainly not this way"
AmItheAsshole,ew1dbjc,t1_ew1cw9m,1565020907.0,Do you think so? I thought they don't know me anyway and wouldn't care :( thanks for your comment
AmItheAsshole,ew1cj0l,t1_ew1a51n,1565020387.0,You would know. Judging an entire social layer based on my post.
AmItheAsshole,ew1cci0,t1_ew1brcb,1565020266.0,"How would you differentiate that? The relationship surely differs but I'd say there some characteristics are common, like slow talking. It sounded way to rude and I see how me declining the dinner was inpolite"
AmItheAsshole,ew1bwx6,t1_ew1blo8,1565019982.0,That's true.
AmItheAsshole,ew1bsm1,t1_ew1b17g,1565019906.0,Well I don't see how my text implies that i had been rude to everybody else? I'm just in a bad Mood but I'm not letting it out on him. I'm only thinking about confronting him later that I don't get why he didn't take the effort to plan. But I see I should've been more responsible about that. And yeah I sounded rude about his grandparents I could've Phrased that differently
AmItheAsshole,ew1aga9,t1_ew1acz7,1565019021.0,Agreed

AmItheAsshole,et3pz4u,t1_et3nfws,1562437286.0,I guess in that context you could say that. It sounded odd to me cause I'd describe stuff from h&m or similiar shops as affordable
