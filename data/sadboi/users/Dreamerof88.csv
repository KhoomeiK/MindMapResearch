Who said a woman can’t look beautiful without hair. I know it would look weird, make my face look flatter, my jawline more round, but so what? I have a biological time clock I can’t control. And if I feel like wearing a wig I can—a colorful one at that. I can get the beautiful baby blue hair I always wanted without dying a single strain-ha. 

But that was all just talk. I’m still a long way from that. I hope you will come to feel beautiful as beauty comes from within. Smile and show your lovely personality and people will like you as you are!! May love and light be bestow upon u!!"

But when friends, stranger, or other people are doing it—it’s a strong sign of disinterest. I knew a girl who would sometimes do this. She’s the kind of people that can weave her way into a group. She knows pretty much someone from each department. She’s a natural speaker and a natural people person. She doesn’t do it to hurt people or ignore them—it is a natural habit of her. It’s like her mind is running a race against time and I have to chase her and tell her to slow down and just pay attention for a moment. I try to play it cool with her, but I know it can be annoying if I stop her too often so I don’t unless I have to.

If the Arthdal eats them, I would understand—but too kill them just for it, I am sure the Neathel also understand grudge and anger. Perhaps, what if they found a colony of survivors?

ArthdalChronicles,fon20k6,t3_g7x7w2,1587910365.0,"I think at the end of her life she was hallucinating. Asa Hon died from physical over exhaustion and probably infection in her feet.

When the Arthdal people came down, they built the bridge. When Asa Hon came, she had to walk through all those hot and boiling sand. 

But if we are to dissect the dream—Aramun did say that if she doesn’t want to die she needs to run far away. She thinks the land below the cliff would be her safe heaven, out of the reach of the Gods. Maybe she is wrong?  She didn’t follow Tagon as instructed, but she didn’t manage to run away like she was told. What does Aramun even mean when he says to run far away? In what land would the God be blind to the actions of men? None. Maybe what she should have done is give her son to Rompit and return to the Asa family or at least Arthdal. Her children were probably the thing she should be running from because they were born when the blue star fell. It seems as long as she has her children or one of the child, she is doomed. Aramun came for the child so maybe he wasn’t in alignment with the God?? Because he couldn’t get what he came for he took the father, which would have been able to raise the two children up as a force Arthdal would fear. 

However, I wonder—if she follows Tagon what would be the outcome? Tagon wouldn’t kill her. She is from the Asa family and would be a great asset to his team. Plus, he would hold great power over knowing her secret. She would definitely work for him to keep her sons alive."

This someone could be in Arthdal since they are in Arthdal when they made the statement, but then we see them again while Eun was doing his side quests. So I’m wondering if they found this someone or if this someone isn’t in Arthdal. 

I think Yangcha could be a child of Shahati. His attitude fits and seems very out of place in the army. However, the Shahati wouldn’t have let Yangcha leave at such a young age. He was by Tagon’s side when Tagon was much younger. 

I’m not a big fan of Yangcha, so I didn’t quite follow up on his story. I can’t ship Tanya and him. But I believe he did grow an ounce of respect towards Tanya."

The mysterious civilization hasn’t even been disclosed, meanwhile their existence is a threat and what they did to Remus is enough to say Arthdal could be destroy in a day.

Or either the sword is mu-baek. He seems to be helping them behind scene. Or—what if the sword is the neathel girl. Hey—she has now learned swordsmanship. According to Mu-Baek the neathel can’t learn swordsmanship, but if one day a neathel did—it would be unrivaled."

According to the untold history and belief of the followers of the original Asa family, Aramun was an Igutu. Since Aramun came from outside, we can assume that maybe he did come from another advance civilization. But if he did come from Mysterious civilization, did they also discriminate against igutu as Aramun never disclosed he was one; or were the mysterious civilization made up of igutu?? It was said Aramun is the son of their God Airuju. That was said in one clip. In another clip, he was said to be sent by Asa Sin who had left Arthdal because of the wars.  The timeline is unclear.

If you are at my local county’s employment and social service center, I would give you a list of pick up free food sites—food that would feed you today and kill you in ten years. By the time you’re ready to die, you would have exactly and barely over 10 years of suffering—maybe 20 years? Also which by then, you would have throw enough $$ into the health system, to be worthy of as a sick and ill assets of the state. 

I get you. I work two jobs and have sugar “craving” problems. I barely have time for me. Any time I got, I spent daydreaming of getting away from here. The earliest I have slept on a work day was 12am. Sometimes, I won’t get home till 11pm. When I come home at 6pm, it’s constant cooking for the lazy piglets at home that are way too old, and prepping my lunch for the following day. 

I am truly tired of this life. I work very hard. But learn I have to work smart—but sometimes working smart is stressful because it put me in position I would rather not be in. But if I don’t take such a position, I won’t get a raise. Sigh. I feel old and weary. I have so much ache and sore—I can look at an elder and wish I won’t live too long."

The dog probably meant good, and thought we were playing a game of run and chase. But little me never took it that way. We were not raised around dogs and knew nothing about their behaviors. I volunteered once at a dog shelter, but quit the first day. My interaction with dogs was so little, I didn’t have the background knowledge to help me. I was more afraid of them than I thought. Haha—since them, no dog for me until my sister bought her dog home. I managed well with him because he was very timid at first, and overtime I learned his behaviors.

starbucks,fg8jujb,t1_fg8i1qm,1580621769.0,"I see. Maybe I should have huh. I didn’t want to make that girl feel bad. It was three remakes and none of it worked. Plus, it was late in the evening. 

I would think that too, but I don’t work for Starbucks, I didn’t request the frap roast to be lower, and this is the customization I had been using for the other two locations in town. Rarely, would the drink be unfixable. 

For the grande size: one pump base, usual pump of frappo  in according to their size, and one flavor syrup. I was told, that for a regular coffee frappe the sugar is in the base so I always lower the base and asked for the same amount of Frappo according to their size. But then, when I say base some staff think I meant the Frappo. Usually, when I bring it in and describe what I am looking for—coffee with less sweetness—they go “oh, I got you” and make it correctly. 

If I order a venti chestnut praline sometimes I request these different variations: 

A: 1.5 flavor, 1 base, usually amount of frap roast plus one extra. I didn’t wanna pay the .50 so I stopped this customization a month ago. 

B: 2 flavor, 2 base, usual amount of frap roast. Occasionally, I’ll ask for extra ice in. I stopped this  customization very early since the Chestnut came in season. It was slightly too sweet for my taste buds. 

C: 1.5 flavor, 1base, and usual amount of frap roast along with extra ice. The last one I had was amazing!! It was made by the location I usually visit. 

Thanks for your response. Next time, I’ll have to ask when correction was made what was been added. The more I understand what goes in the drink, the better I could explain how and what I want in my drink."

ArthdalChronicles,ffs0ucp,t1_ffmgznj,1580170399.0,"I think they did a great job with the military expansion because as long as one group could be control to do the biting of a leader and expand territory, the living in harmony with nature concept is crush to pieces. 

The Nweantal was said to be the strongest among the intelligent species but they were hunted to almost extinction for their lack of military assets. With just the right brain and their knowledge of their own territory, the Saram would have been pushed out of the Plains of the Moon. 

The court thing was—yucky. I would love to see less, but it is also where we see HOW people were control with religion and fear. It makes me think humans are stupid, including me. It just didn’t make sense how Igutus and Nweantals were hated to the core. The only reason to this madness and scapegoat is that this hatred is being directed by people breeding for control and  the concept of property. 

Arth is just a small area of their world. Who knows what else could be find. The people that destroy Remus looks alot like Rome. I wonder if they are gonna get some White and British to play the role haha. Writer needs to create a common enemy for both Saram and Nweantal! 

We have saw Bronze, we have a hint of Steel, now we saw the myth of the Shield. I truly wonder if the next season would live up to my expectation and I am very curious to who the Nweantal were looking for. What thing would be so important that they came all the way to Arthdal."
ArthdalChronicles,ffl71ga,t1_ffkc98z,1580035712.0,"Yea I heard about it too. Idk why celebrities would still do something morally wrong knowing that they r public figures. Their lives aren’t their own!! Hahah. But people change, people grow, so I hope each and everyone will learn. 

I am also looking forward to season 2. It will likely take awhile but it will surely come. It was said they signed the contract. 

I’m just thinking, that by the time a new season come out I would have forgotten much of the details and would have to either win it or rewatch. Plus, I wouldn’t have the same feeling as right now.

I truly hope, despite all this drama we would get to see something this fall."
ArthdalChronicles,ffjvl26,t1_ffj81ix,1580008154.0,"If the Nweantal still rule the Plains of The Moon, the Saram can’t move in to do agriculture. Plus, they would be the Saram’s greatest enemy. They don’t just fear the strength of the Nweantal, but the attitude as well. If people start following how the Nweantal lives, the Arthdal wouldn’t have their town and nation.

The Nweantal do not have greed and vengeance like the Saram; and seem they can’t be control with religion. They were hunted to almost extinction but the remaining ones doesn’t seem interested in revenge. They also would not turn against each other, as you see, they weren’t killed from the inside. They were poisoned and then killed because a spy could not be planted. 

Look at the Ago tribes. Idk if Eun would ever find out who Red Claw really is. 

You really should go re-watch."

ArthdalChronicles,ffj0idl,t1_ffiv5xe,1579987308.0,"Of course they know!! But she’s a pure Nweantal. The last known female, which I think is absurd and not likely. Mass genocide in unknown territory is unlikely especially in a jungle like Plain of the Moon where Nweantals have lived their entire lives. They know the up and down, and how to navigate it and make use of it to their advantage. The chance of survival out there is pretty high. If you watch the clip of how Igutu came to be regarded as bad luck, there were many Igutu meaning at one time the Saram and the Nweantal got along. There ought to be a couple who blend in with Saram or can go and in and out without notice. 

The prophecy should be taken as just foreshadowing. One curse already came true, so I believe we can bet that the prophecy would also hold true. 

They met Eun and passed Saya. Who knows if Rottip will ever tell the twin of their parents history. I think everyone has the right to know about their parents. Sadly, no one ever bother to tell them of their parents—not even Moo-Baek. I kinda wonder if Eun even know Arthdal is the home of his mother and he’s part of the Asa Clan. 

Life itself is a bunch of melodramatic back and forth. It’s a mystery and that’s what make all shows interesting—because nothing is obvious or clearly said. I think the director did a great job at creating suspense. It’s theories until we see the theories unfollow within the drama. So far this isn’t a soap opera I am annoy at."
ArthdalChronicles,ffiu7b4,t1_ffi2zt5,1579982829.0,"No. They didn’t know she exist until they met her. They were mixing in with the town folks and witness the scheming of mankind. Why? 

Rottip clearly said they were looking for someone, when Moo-Baek asked what they were doing in Arthdal. He asked if they succeeded, Yiseuroobeu responded that “they will, soon.”

Yiseuroobeu looked over when he said it, but I think he wasn’t referring to her. 

I’m rather curious, if showing us that the two Nweantal saw Chae-Eun and Moo-Baek means they follow Chae-Eun to find Nunbyeol."
