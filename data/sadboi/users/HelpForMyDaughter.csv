Last night we took a drive and talked for about 30 minutes. I told her I was so proud of her for trusting me enough to tell me.  We talked about the dangers of what she's doing.  We talked about whether she is wanting to die - she says she doesn't want to die.  I have to believe her in that, but I also know that can be something extremely hard to admit to someone.

We have decided to call her doctor today and see about getting her on some meds for depression.

I need to take her to do more things.  We used to do a monthly daddy/daughter date.  Unfortunately, life got in the way and I didn't make the time to do that with her.  That's a problem I'm going to correct.

Thank you again.


Edit:  forgot a word"
StopSelfHarm,fdn9sas,t1_fdm7zuq,1578581044.0,I tried to answer both you & undercurrents with the same msg above.  Thank you both for taking the time to respond.
StopSelfHarm,fdn9ovd,t1_fdl9d07,1578580977.0,"The bullying was happening during the last year of school (6th grade).  It's no excuse for the bullying, but my daughter is like her dad - stubborn and witty.  So while she was getting picked on by several kids, she held her own for quite awhile.

Initially we thought the Christmas break would cool things off between them all and things would get back to normal.  But, school started back up in January and it picked right back up.  That is when we started meeting with the teacher.

In February after her note, we took her out of school for probably 2 weeks.  She would go for a part of a day, then come home.  Or take a day.

March is when the kids started telling her to kill herself.  We had no idea that was said until another parent called to tell us.  At that point, we met with the principal.

To make this short - the principal did little to nothing.  Over several meetings, she seemed to care little about our problems.  Our goal was to make it through the remaining 6 weeks of school and we did.

Moving from a grade school (K - 6) into a Junior/Senior High school and some of the bullies moving to different schools, we hoped the issues would not follow.  For the most part, they haven't.  However, we've had a few things happen that we've ultimately decided that it's time to seriously consider moving schools.  I really don't want to uproot her in the middle of the year and put her into a school she doesn't know anyone, but we will.  I won't put her mental health at jeopardy by subjecting her to another year where the school will not handle it."
StopSelfHarm,fdn8092,t1_fdl5l13,1578579768.0,"Thank you.  Initially, I was upset.  But I very quickly realized that being upset with her is going to make the situation worse and not better.

I know that she is struggling and I want nothing more than to fix it for her, but I know that it is something she is going to have to work through.

She is really into art and it may be the dad in me, but I think she's talented.  We've tried to encourage her talent - we bought her a monthly arts & craft kit for Christmas.

Thank you again for the response.  It means a lot that you took the time to lend a little advice."
