For me it took a lifetime involved with gangs and organised crime. The violence I witnessed over the years and all the friends who I lost. Some people are wired differently....I've had attempts on my life that I really dont even give much thought too. Where for some an attempt on their life could be an earth shattering event.

I had money , I had women, nice car.....but at what cost ? Numerous attempts on my life. One was almost successful, which caused me to have a stroke. The trips to vegas , all the shit I had means nothing now. I've lost more friends then I have fingers and toes. I see the people that made the right decisions in life, I see them happy with careers and families. While I'm 36 and learning to start over. How did things get better ? I have a legitimate job, and I can look at myself in the mirror. It took a while but im starting to somewhat feel like a normal person. That's how it got better for me.

I was involved with gangs and as I like to say graduated to organized crime. While there are certainly a few instances that stick out as being the worst. I lived a long period of time (most of my life really ) always on the lookout for someone wanting to take my life. Some people certainly did try and they almost got what they wanted. But I think my problems stem from being exposed to violence, and always having my head on a swivel for so many years. I dont feel guilt for the label I have been given. Neither should you."

Theres a guy on instigram that teaches a unique skill set on how to survive and escape abduction scenarios and such. Recently had the opportunity to attend one of his classes. Something he says really resonated with me and I find comfort in this saying as it applies to people like us and people in bad situations some where. "" all restraints are temporary, you either learn to get out of them urself, or you die and you rot away around these restraints"". What I'm trying to say is we have to learn some kind of way to not allow what we have to cripple us....dont give life or what ever someone may have done the satisfaction of knowing they beat you.

Ill be very honest (i know taking someones word is not very easy to do online) but being who I am and the life I have lived. I have i guess one could say very unorthodox real world experience that is 100% frowned upon by anyone on the right. Besides my love for pew pew and wanting to share that knowledge, I thought perhaps the more left leaning peeps would be more accepting. I am far from a racist, I am a white dude of eastern European and Italian decent, that grew up in very bad parts of Chinatown. Which lead to my unique type of understanding involving real world violence. Which I think is valuable for anyone interested in learning how to defend themselves. The right tends to look down on people like me. An it would be nice to meet people and make some friends. As most everyone i grew up with have passed on or fell into the revolving door prison system. My wife is Chicana and I have a 15 year old son. Im curious as if anything ive mentioned would change outlooks upon me wanting to get involved in teaching/helping people learn. Thanks."
ptsd,eu8zu75,t1_eu7pldx,1563568450.0,"I happen to agree with you; while I personally have never been involved in anything that involved ""civilians"". I know full well we are not angels. The only thing I can say in my defense is that the groups i personally were involved with were not the typical gang society as a whole seems to think of. This is a little strange but these groups where for the most part above the normal street level gangs. This does not make it any less bad or less immoral. But at a certain level any sort of immoral act committed againts a person not involved in that cirlce was frounded upon and often punishable. I would like to apologize for any thing that anyone has suffered at the hands of gang members. I truely am genuine in my apology even tho I can only speak for myself."
ptsd,eu8ydgd,t1_eu899gy,1563567503.0,"100% agree. I listen to a lot of podcasts that are about security, usually hosted by former military guys. The best way ive heard it described of when ur no longer living a high speed life is: ""i feel like a Lamborghini in a school zone destine to drive 20mph for the rest of my life"". Again you are correct about not all of them neccesarily being bad people. A lot of guys i knew where stand up guys, even when it came to normal day to day life. A few volunteered at hospitals, and enjoyed helping the homeless due to a few being homeless at one point in time during their own lives. Unfortunately when bad things had to be done, these same characters were doing some immoral activities. Also gang culture as a whole isnt ready to accept help from outside sources. The fear of being labeled a rat, not having heart, and the overall machismo of that life gets in the way from acknowledging any specific problems. Only with the closest of the close of my former ""brothers"" did any of us acknowledge that something bothered us emotionally. An usually this only occured after pretty extreme events. For example the the funeral of a baby, the 8th month old died from a some sort of health complications from birth. I remember the service vividly, and was a pall bearer. Years later the father committed suicide. Years later when speaking to a friend did I learn that the funeral had a very same effect on the both of us. Being able to recall smells sounds and colors that reminded us both of that tragic day."

Is that from the hypervigilance? I just was told i had this a day ago.
communism,et5xjia,t3_c9syok,1562495489.0,Communism in russia simply went underground. Many kgb defectors spoke and wrote about the false collapse. All to make the US believe it won the cold war. Instead the US opened itself to further subversion by communists. The US intel communities underestimated and misunderstood the level of psychological warfare perpetrated by the Soviets. Exactly why so many young people have been brainwashed into believing in such a murderous ideology with its origins in many left hand path luciferian masonic lodges of the french revolution.
