My dream job from 10 years old was to be a forensic psychologist. Do you feel it's too late to take this path? I'm single, no kids, so I feel I could but unsure especially with the financial part of it."

I was a server at a restraunt, decent money, I love the interactions with people. Needless to say, that's gone for now. I'm just along for the ride now. Dive deep, find what makes you happy, go for it. It's our life, no one else's. Much love! Best wishes to you mate!"
