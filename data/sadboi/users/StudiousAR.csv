That it's okay to finally let go, you know? Some people just need reassurance. That the darkness is finally ending, that it's okay to finally go into that good night. 

I agree that ""lol do it"" or anything aggressively promoting suicide is problematic and shouldn't be encouraged. But there's unity in knowing that people understand and that they're in the same boat. I've seen people unfairly banned for that. Someone was offering their sincere hopes that whatever an OP did that they would find the solace they couldn't here, in the now. And bam! Banned for life.  

I haven't said anything remotely like that but I'm a bit paranoid I'll be banned for even mentioning it. posting from another account just so my main one doesn't get roasted for asking"
