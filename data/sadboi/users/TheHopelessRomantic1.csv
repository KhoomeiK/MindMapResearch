modernwarfare,fmrphb9,t1_fmrpaam,1586330728.0,Iâ€™m sure thatâ€™s the reason. Get yourself to sleep then fella. Iâ€™m literally about to load up now so Iâ€™ll add you and then you can let me know when you want that beating. Goodnight
modernwarfare,fmrper0,t3_fx11hq,1586330656.0,Wonâ€™t be on mic though. Iâ€™ll post it on here after so the guy who refused to play me can see.
modernwarfare,fmrpdn7,t1_fmrp5zd,1586330625.0,"I would never tell anyone to camp. I donâ€™t like camping, I know itâ€™s a play style and thatâ€™s fair enough for them guys who arenâ€™t good enough to rush, but itâ€™s not for me I donâ€™t find it fun. I mean try different things, routes, shot type, approach, all sorts  of things you can change up. Nobody is that good at the game that you canâ€™t kill them, unless they are cheating, but if you do the same thing all the time, or if you take obvious paths you will get shredded of course. 

Iâ€™ll do that right now. My name is the same as here."
modernwarfare,fmrp5z7,t1_fmrp4sh,1586330414.0,Another excuse. Turn it in pal. You are a beaten man. GET GOOD BRO!!!
modernwarfare,fmrp4er,t1_fmrp14p,1586330370.0,"I donâ€™t pay for skins, Iâ€™m not 6years old. 

Play me now then? A lot of people on here talk shit but canâ€™t back it up. GET GOOD BRO."
modernwarfare,fmrp2lm,t1_fmrorc6,1586330322.0,"As I said the first time, no balls. Another lad with a big mouth but canâ€™t back it up. Iâ€™ll stream it live for everyone whoâ€™s commented so they can witness you quit because you canâ€™t handle it. A quick 5mins, I mean youâ€™ve been on 5 mins since you refused my offer. Just prove you are decent? Or at least a bit of a threat. 

Iâ€™ll make you a better deal then, you can have any load out, and Iâ€™ll just have throwing knives and nothing else, kill me 5 times and Iâ€™ll delete my cod account, bet I still nuke you."
modernwarfare,fmrovbr,t1_fmrom6f,1586330122.0,"Letâ€™s go 1v1 right now? Or Iâ€™ll even let you bring a mate and go 1v2?

Yea so you are a bad player that needs to play people worse than him to get a decent KD, thanks for clarifying the obvious smart lad. You wonâ€™t get better leaving when you get people you canâ€™t handle, thatâ€™s when you adapt, adjust and learn."
modernwarfare,fmrop79,t1_fmrokl9,1586329956.0,"Itâ€™ll take 5mins for me to teach you a quick lesson, kill me once in 5mins and Iâ€™ll delete my account, if I donâ€™t get a nuke against you in 5mins Iâ€™ll delete my account. 100%. 

No life? Iâ€™m just locked down like everyone else lad. Iâ€™m not a die hard gamer. 
Iâ€™m also not a sad Fucker that leaves a game because I suck."
modernwarfare,fmrojbk,t1_fmrn78l,1586329795.0,Well done you can read.
modernwarfare,fmroihy,t1_fmrobn2,1586329773.0,"Why would you enjoy one lobby and not the other? Because you are getting smashed is the only reason, which again Iâ€™ll say it, GET GOOD. The only way to improve is to play better players, you bitches just want an easy game to feel good about winning something because you lead pathetic lives."
modernwarfare,fmrocvu,t1_fmro99b,1586329622.0,"I didnâ€™t play it then, Iâ€™m not a die hard gamer, Iâ€™ve got a life too. Only been playing it for this modern warfare game. I didnâ€™t think you would have the balls. Another talker. Get good."
modernwarfare,fmro95q,t1_fmrn89v,1586329522.0,So you are saying you need better opponents thatâ€™s why you leave? I highly doubt that ðŸ˜‚
modernwarfare,fmro358,t1_fmro0oc,1586329362.0,"So am I lad. Keep waiting. Better yet, get yourself online and Iâ€™ll play against you  1 on 1 and then Iâ€™ll put the results on here win or lose. Bet you quit before itâ€™s done."
modernwarfare,fmro0h2,t1_fmrnsps,1586329290.0,"Slow maps? What does that mean?

Sbmm does need sorting and youâ€™ve also just confirmed that you are leaving because you arenâ€™t good enough, therefore my conclusion was right."
modernwarfare,fmrnu16,t1_fmrm3hv,1586329121.0,"Just raised right. Iâ€™m not a quitter, and I donâ€™t spit my dummy out if someone is better than me at something. Not hard to live with a bit of pride lads, try it."
modernwarfare,fmrnr9j,t1_fmrnlr6,1586329045.0,"You know, everyone does. Itâ€™s 100% neg. loading up in a min so Iâ€™ll put a photo up so you can see."
modernwarfare,fmrnppx,t1_fmrnjjm,1586329003.0,"You make it easy dude, put the controller down and pick up a book."
modernwarfare,fmrnki3,t1_fmrn5ei,1586328865.0,"Haha yea right. Iâ€™m gonna look at your stats in cod now, as season 3 is almost done, and I will post them on here, guarantee you have a neg KD"
modernwarfare,fmrnhxv,t1_fmrndwe,1586328798.0,So you edit it after I reply and call me a tit lol. How about get it right the first time you brainless fuck.
modernwarfare,fmrner1,t1_fmrncqv,1586328712.0,"Why would you not be enjoying it? Itâ€™s the same thing every game whats a new game gonna do? 

You are just another lad who isnâ€™t good enough to go positive so you leave."
modernwarfare,fmrncpa,t1_fmrn5ei,1586328659.0,"I said free for all you tit, itâ€™s a game mode. 

I donâ€™t get salty, because Iâ€™m actually good at the game, Iâ€™m simply asking if anyone else believes there should be punishment for the SALTY people who leave games early. 

Itâ€™s not an argument, itâ€™s an opinion, therefore it cannot be wrong, and I can not lose anything. 

I didnâ€™t search you, itâ€™s on your reddit you absolute idiot. 


Anything else you need to say to make yourself look more of a simpleton?"
modernwarfare,fmrn02f,t1_fmrmydd,1586328325.0,Again how would you know if they are going to buy you back then. You really arenâ€™t a smart lad are you lmao.
modernwarfare,fmrmx7q,t1_fmrmp8e,1586328252.0,"I have a full clan, but obviously I play on my own also. You keep calling it a casual game lol, itâ€™s a team game, free for all is there for those who are casual and need to leave when they canâ€™t keep up. Why would you play a team game to quit? Because you die even more on free for all. You got a 10-7 on ground war dude, that tells me everything I need to know about you."
modernwarfare,fmrmobh,t1_fmrmgnr,1586328024.0,How would you know if they will buy you back? You just said you leave when you die in gulag?
modernwarfare,fmrmku3,t1_fmrllbq,1586327934.0,"Yea but everyone has the some options, if someone is camping in the same place you should only take a maximum of two or three deaths before you get them. People only get caught out by campers more than once because they take the same routes."
modernwarfare,fmrmh6m,t1_fmrluml,1586327838.0,"Stop relying on team mates?lmfao. Itâ€™s a team game, and I donâ€™t care who you are, you arenâ€™t winning warzone and playing without camping on your own."
modernwarfare,fmrmb6y,t1_fmrlb22,1586327679.0,I play both. Clearly another noob struggling to keep up so heâ€™s leaving games.
modernwarfare,fmrm8t5,t1_fmrl8we,1586327617.0,"Why? Thatâ€™s the easiest kills, just about flanking and quick shot."
modernwarfare,fmrm6pg,t1_fmrlq1h,1586327562.0,Fair one.
modernwarfare,fmrm677,t1_fmrl858,1586327550.0,"No they donâ€™t rage quit, when they arenâ€™t streaming they leave games if their KD is negative or near neg."
modernwarfare,fmrm4fm,t1_fmrl80r,1586327504.0,"If you arenâ€™t enjoying it dont play cod, what you are saying is, I leave when Iâ€™m getting killed loads because Iâ€™m not very good."
modernwarfare,fmrm2i3,t1_fmrl1zw,1586327453.0,Haha thatâ€™s exactly whoâ€™s doing it lol.
modernwarfare,fmrlzox,t1_fmrl7cm,1586327380.0,Watching? You can get bought back. I imagine you play alone all the time and thatâ€™s why it doesnâ€™t bother you.
modernwarfare,fmrlxl0,t1_fmrlajp,1586327325.0,"You wouldnâ€™t, because the game would be done by the time you are back. Itâ€™s people who leave games and join another straight away Iâ€™m talking about."
modernwarfare,fmrlu0k,t1_fmrlnot,1586327232.0,"I donâ€™t ever camp, and I use different weapons constantly. I also donâ€™t leave games when Iâ€™m beaten by the better man because I was raised with sportsmanship."
modernwarfare,fmrlqrg,t1_fmrlby9,1586327147.0,"Thatâ€™s just part of the game, everyone lags out at some point, everyone has bad games, and It is annoying but the times people leave because of lag are very few compared to people who just canâ€™t handle the enemy."
modernwarfare,fmrllco,t1_fmrlhsl,1586327006.0,So another guy who needs to get good lol.
modernwarfare,fmrljzj,t1_fmrlh2y,1586326971.0,"Exactly, yet your leaving Lobbyâ€™s because you are been outplayed, therefore trying to find a lobby that you can outplay someone, whereâ€™s the challenge in that?"
modernwarfare,fmrlh8f,t1_fmrldoi,1586326900.0,"I personally donâ€™t like the challenges on this cod, just asking for people to camp. Spawn traps are annoying tbf but there is always a way out."
modernwarfare,fmrldjo,t1_fmrlcjg,1586326804.0,"Why? Just get good, thatâ€™s so childish lol. Losing so you leave."
TigerKing,fmq91j3,t1_fmormex,1586295155.0,"I think itâ€™s because he payed $1000 dollars to go to a trump fundraiser, then went out for a smoke and they wouldnâ€™t let him back in. Joe been Joe made out like they had a problem with him, the way he dresses and other things. Though Iâ€™ve done security at similar events and itâ€™s standard procedure."
TigerKing,fmbp8g0,t1_fmb3u82,1585930696.0,"Sold, where do I sign?"
TigerKing,fmb503t,t3_fu6lg3,1585918485.0,"Very strange. Its like a tribute to the freakiest circus on the planet. Brilliant watch, not brilliant people. I bet thatâ€™s not even your sisters hand, I bet itâ€™s that bitch Carole Baskin."
TigerKing,fmao5il,t3_ftyxvn,1585901185.0,"I can just imagine stealing a tiger and riding it over to that bitch Carol Baskins house to murder her, then Iâ€™ll dig around until I find Don Lewis, then Iâ€™m gonna drag that body to the jail that joes in and Iâ€™m gonna free that mother fucker, get some meth, get married and lose all my teeth. Mission complete, game time 7days, earned $100 and I get a caravan thatâ€™s only been used by 43 people before me."
TigerKing,fmanmaa,t3_ftvuxl,1585900588.0,"My favourite two shows lmao. One is hilarious, complete genius, great writers, with brilliant characters, crazy story lines and shenanigans the other is always sunny in Philadelphia."
mentalhealth,fmaa6fo,t3_fu1h0z,1585887894.0,"Donâ€™t give up. I am going through the same thing, have been since about 2015, but now itâ€™s in phases, things do get better but the challenge is getting through the bad days. 
Feeling like you are no longer you is very common, you are not alone there. You will get your old self back, or at least a similar better new self. 

Itâ€™s about recognising where things started, and what was the cause. 

If you fancy a chat, give me a message mate. 

If not, keep your chin up, express your feelings someone(in your own time), and then make a plan to get you back to a happy state."
mentalhealth,fma9euc,t3_ftymoj,1585887292.0,"Give them a call. Itâ€™s completely anonymous and can be a massive help, nobody ever has to know, and you might find itâ€™s exactly what you need. If you or your bf ever need anyone to talk to, feel free to inbox me. That goes for anyone, if you need someone to talk to, to listen, advice, a friend or anything at all. 

Stick together, be strong and flourish all as one."
OnlineDating,fma758o,t3_fmwavd,1585885557.0,"People need to start actually talking in real life, there are apps for everything now, itâ€™s so sad. People complain about tinder and things yet refuse to go out and actually meet real people, thatâ€™s why so many people have mental health problems these days, people build there Crete their own anxietyâ€™s, they feel lonely, or used, thatâ€™s because you arenâ€™t taking life seriously. The moment you use an app for finding a person, you have already failed. Yes there are some couples out there that make it from apps like that, but rarely, and itâ€™s not the same as two people who meet and fall for each other naturally. Go out there and just be yourself, and you will meet someone who is made for you."
mentalhealth,fma418r,t3_fe059g,1585883282.0,"Well done. If you ever feel like you are falling back into that place, please message me, I know Iâ€™m a stranger, but we all need to stick together. Life is hard, and so many people have mental heath issues, unfortunately so many go under the radar, because there is still a huge stigma with it. Thatâ€™s because people who havenâ€™t been through the same can never truly understand the darkness and pain other people feel, so they find it hard to believe itâ€™s not just for attention. 

Good thing is, the world is waking up to it rapidly, and itâ€™s because of people like you sharing your experiences, triumphs, and motivating other people to follow that path. Keep it up. 

If anyone ever needs someone to talk to, please message me. Iâ€™m a 30yo man, Iâ€™m from the uk, and I donâ€™t judge anybody. I can listen or talk, I can give advice, or even just friendship. Nobody should feel alone."
