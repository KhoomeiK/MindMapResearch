The whole Black Lives Matter movement came from black people seeing far too many other black people being unjustly killed by white police and white citizens who received no legal punishment. The message seemed very clear: If you‚Äôre black, you don‚Äôt matter.

Imagine that you‚Äôre hanging at home one night and the doorbell rings. You open the door to find your neighbor Anthony in a panic.

He calls the fire department and while they struggle to save Anthony‚Äôs house, you keep reminding the firefighters that you and all your neighbors also have houses that are just as valuable as Anthony‚Äôs and that it‚Äôs actually unfair of them to focus all their attention on his house.
