changemyview,fqz1b61,t3_glmmzf,1589758138.0,"Sex work leaves the possibility for vile and unsafe work practices the more normalized it is. 

Yes, there are places where it is legal. But to suggest that normalizing or legalizing the profession would help us, especially where I live in the states, is laughable. 

The more we accept seeing it around us, the more we allow the criminal underworld to start trafficking humans for their bodies. If I had a daughter, I would never ever encourage her to believe that her body is a tool for transactions to be completed. It suggests that her worth is based  upon her body and not her potential intellectually.

Do I believe that we should shame women who are in a situation like you describe? Absolutely not! Should we shame men and women who pay for sex? Abso-fucking-lutely. Unless you are physically disabled, you have no right to use your financial leverage to appeal to someone in a more dire situation. 

The truth is, many of these people who sell their bodies didn't just wake up and decide to. Most are forced to do this job, by means of physical abuse, psychological tactics, drug abuse, and poverty. Many are forced to, by their husbands or parents. It's more likely to be someone close to them than not. 

If you were forced to have sex with strangers from the beginning of your childhood, for someone else's benefit, of course you would defend yourself from people shaming you. You would likely try to escape this pain by controlling your sexuality even more, possibly continuing prostitution because it is all you were taught to do. 

My source for all this? It happened to my girlfriend, and I've seen the effects of sex trafficking on the soul. It is horrendous and can cause damage like you wouldn't believe. Yet we still act like it's just a transaction, it's about bodily freedom, etc. We love celebrities like Snoop Dogg, who have spoken outwardly about sex trafficking. He said, ""I did that. I wanted to see if I could control a bitch, and I did."" 

Do you want me to have the right to give your daughter some heroin for a blowjob? No? Then there's your answer.

Edit: Also, to say that regulating sex work by allowing a company to do it is naive. A friend of mine has family in Mexico growing coca plants. They're more afraid of the black vans owned by Coca Cola when they approach than the actual cartel. Corporations are even more empowered to exploit people on an international scale, and if you trust them with people's bodies, you are putting too much faith in them."
