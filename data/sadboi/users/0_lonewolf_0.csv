selfharm,f77ccnb,t1_f776m86,1573450698.0,"It might help to talk to someone else that doesn’t SH, but I completely get how it’s really hard to open up to people. I think the first time I talked to my friend was because they noticed my scars, but they were really supportive. But I know how hard it can be to talk to others about something like this. I also do understand what you mean about not thinking clearly and regretting it afterwards, cause that used to happen to me a lot. I’ve been clean for a few months mostly, but I have slipped up a few times in the middle and cut myself. Just make sure you don’t let that set you back and keep trying. I believe in you :)"
selfharm,f76u5nl,t1_f6ypu3e,1573435873.0,"it might actually help to talk to someone you trust about your cutting. cause i used to be kinda addicted to it almost, but i talked to one of my friends about it and it helped me stop since i would refrain from cutting for their sake. maybe focusing on something else when you want to cut might help too. cause drawing or reading used to help for me sometimes too. i’m not sure how helpful this is, but dm me if you ever want to talk."

Something very similar has happened to me with one of my friends and though I’m not proud of it, i did end up cutting more than before partially because of that. I’ve been clean for over a month now though, and hopefully it stays that way. As hard as it is, try resist cutting deeper because of what your cousin said. I believe in you, you can do this!"

Though I still haven’t figured out what to do about it lol"
