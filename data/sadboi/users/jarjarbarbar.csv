CPTSD,ff7rufr,t3_erxvw7,1579656832.0,"You sound like my sibling.....hmmmmm lol ðŸ˜… that would be really awkward if this was you. 

Honestly I relate to you so we'll. I've been in a similar situation. A lot of anger and hatred. All of us just had a shell on"
ptsd,ff7r0r3,t3_es448k,1579656256.0,"Hey there ðŸ‘‹ im in a similar situation to you, I do remember pieces of my childhood but a lot of it is a blurry mess. I've gone back and forth between whether or not I have PTSD (even though I  got professionally diagnosed)  because of people telling me it was all in my head, I started to doubt the diagnosis. The big thing is if you've been diagnosed you know it's real. When I get those times that I think it's all in my head, I think of all the messed up thoughts/actions I've had that made me seek out help In the first place. Don't let's others word tell you different, you know you better than anyone else on this earth. Plus more than likely the people who tell you it's in your head haven't studied PTSD for 5-8 years, trust what the doc is saying, I know trust comes hard, but you need to trust the professional over your friends and family"
bipolar,ff4dioe,t1_ff4cgyf,1579561048.0,I suppose that makes sense...I just don't understand why he'd put me on mood stabilizer and not give me a diagnosis. But I guess I've only met with him 3 times and I take it these type of things take time to diagnose
bipolar,ff4d3dg,t1_ff4ceex,1579560768.0,"He didn't, the reason I think it is, and the moment I knew something was up was when despite me feeling sad I was laughing and full of energy. I was literally laughing and in tears at the same time. My family has witnessed these bouts of energy. And they've seen me depressed for literally months. Sometimes the smallest thing can set me off. But on a different day that same thing isn't a big deal. honestly I more so want to get this fix more than anything. And don't care if it's bipolar or another disorder as long as I can get this taken care of, it's just most of my symptoms match up with bipolar disorder"
