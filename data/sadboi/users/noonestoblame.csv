awakened,f8y7e81,t1_f8v61h2,1574942403.0,"I respectfully agree and disagree.  Yes, for me as I understood more I simply naturally integrated more into my life as it was what I wanted.  However I have to disagree about the ""genuine spirituality doesn't start until you integrate it into your life"" part as well as the ""shallow intellectual"" part.  I see a lot of people who think they are integrating spirituality into their life, but in my opinion they could have used quite a bit more of the ""shallow intellectual"" part before they did, because they in my opinion miss very foundational things that would be pretty universal to any school of thought.  Also, I think everyone integrates some form of spirituality in their life to the degree that they feel it and know it.  Whether it's an act of kindness, or a sense of fairness, etc.

While I do agree with the whole ""put it into practice thing"" and am not a fan of hearing people say ""I'm an asshole, but I know I'm an asshole so that's at least better"" - especially when they think it somehow diminishes the effect of their actions - I do think a great barrier would be removed, even though no action may have been taken, if more people even intellectually understood that some things were, shall we say, ""allowed"" and ""not allowed"" (or put it ""cruel"" and ""kind"", or ""within your sphere of freedom"" and ""encroaching on another beings sphere of freedom"" - however it works for you).  For example, and yes this is my personal belief (though I admit God him/her/it/them self could not convince me otherwise), that killing anything, whether a roach, a fly, a cow, a chicken - anything - is not within anyone's right, as nothing in or out of the Universe has a right to harm something that doesn't want to be harmed.  Now when I say I believe this, I mean I know it for myself in every fiber of my being.  BUT, I am a selfish asshole piece of shit murderer, because I still haven't stopped eating meat.  Why?  For all the selfish asshole murderer reasons that have zero validity.  It's at the point where I should just start getting sick anytime I try to eat meat so that I have no choice but to stop.  Now there is an example of ""shallow intellectual"" maybe for you.  Yet for me, if everyone had at least this same shallow intellectual belief, it may translate into some action - even if it were gentler care and better conditions for the animals (which isnt enough, but less pain is always good).

&#x200B;

Last thing, and I too have to catch myself in this.  I don't think you can say it's not a competition and also say there are ways that are better to live than others, that some things are shallow, and then end it with the standard throw-away BS line - ""that's fine, everyone has their journey"" - because that's just masked superiority I believe.  What you're really saying is ""I am a better person than these other people and I know better than they do, but I don't want to sound like I'm being critical of them so, hey, we all are where we are, but I'm still better"".  That is one of the problems in my opinion with many practitioners of Eastern schools of thought.  It's like ""However you are is how you're meant to be, everyone is perfect, but the right way to really do things is xyz (or the better way, or the more spiritual way, whatever).  It's laced with judgement and hypocrisy.  Not to mention the speaker assumes they now see things correctly and are not still blind to 80 zillion things that put them on a far ""worse"" path than they think.  Now I agree, everyone is who they are and I agree we are all on whatever journey we are on.  Is it a competition?  Between each of us?  I don't know.  Does it bring me more peace and Love and reduce both positive judgement of myself and negative judgement of others is I can not see it as a competition, yes.  BUT am I left with positive and superior judgement of myself if I in any way put a value on where I think I am as opposed to anyone else?  ABSOLUTELY.  And so long as I think I am doing something better, so long as I think I am in any way better, so long as I think I am in any way different, I will still have judgement.  And judgement is the poison that infects all.  Again, this is why I believe they say the last step in Buddhism is to realize there actually is no such thing as enlightenment.  That a person, after trying and learning and growing for decades towards this goal of being more enlightened, must realize that not only is there no such final goal, but there isn't even such a path.  That all things are equal, and everything they thought they were doing that ""enhanced"" them they were still doing, but they were not being ""enhanced"".  The good news though is, that might just free one from a lot of pain which will enable them to have unlimited Love and Empathy for every creature.  So by having that very hard realization that will probably be the last death of this cycle, they become a being of unconditional Love and they never again think of a prize for themselves, they only care about what others want and need.  Love you, sorry for the ramble."
awakened,f8v5j3j,t3_e28vva,1574860199.0,"This is an excellent point and it holds true in so many things (though I'm not suggesting its easy or that we are always able to implement it).  


Just think, you can never lose a race if you're not in it.  While everyone else is feeling the pressure of proving themselves, or validating themselves, all so they can end up with a medal that gives them external validation that isn't real, won't last, and will leave them hurt and needing more validation, you (or I) could simply be watching from the sidelines, or not watching at all.  We could observe, or forget that people even have things like races.  Why?  Because you know you've already won.  Not because you've beaten anyone else, but because whatever winning the race could give someone on the inside, you already have that, so of course it would feel silly racing.  In fact that thing you have inside is why you have no desire to race and why you can hail the winner and congratulate them without any feelings of jealousy or superiority.  You are whole, and whole does not need to take, or resent what is taken.  Remember, you can never lose if you don't race.  You can never be made to feel foolish when you already know were all fools.  You can never feel embarrassed for having the ""wrong"" answer when you already know that sometimes you blurt things out without thinking through them.   You can never feel shamed if you know you are who you are and you always will be, just like the rest of us.

We lose interest in thoughts that aren't real.  If someone tells me I'm not trying hard enough because I didn't run the race it doesn't affect me, because it's a silly statement.  So the thought has no power.  


BUT BUT BUT be warned.  In my opinion, or better yet, speaking for how I function, since I don't have self-Love (I probably have it by most people's measures, but not by the real measure only a few use), if there is any part of me that I doubt, that is where a thought can nestle in and infect me.  Worse yet, **anxiety, panic, they are the result of a thought becoming more powerful than my belief in myself.**  In the way I seem to operate, if I have a thought for example that is ""I'm worried I will get a claustrophobic attack on the airplane today"" that is the start of the feelings of anxiety.  Now if I can push that thought away (not likely for me) or I can find the belief in myself that I am in control (not likely for me) I could end the anxiety and expel the thought, because it would not be important anymore.  However instead what happens to me is the anxiety keeps pushing it's boundaries, keeps saying ""then this is going to happen, then that will happen, then you'll feel like this, then it will be so horrible, then you'll be trapped, then you'll go crazy on the plane..."".  Now with each increase in my anxieties boldness, my belief in myself has a chance to say ""oh shut up, that's not going to happen"" (which in this specific example it really isn't able to yet).  So instead, my belief in myself gets smaller and smaller and smaller until....BAM I reach 0 belief in my ability to have any effect over the situation and the feelings and that's when the panic attack begins.   For me I have seen that panic sets in the moment I decide I am powerless to help myself.  It's like so long as there is even one shred of belief in myself left the panic is held back, but once that last wall falls then of course I panic, because I am now in a world where I am but the plaything of my fears, and I have decided I have no ability to ever stop it.

I brought that up because I agree very much with the OP, however I offer that personal explanation and story for anyone to either relate to or not, and then maybe if they are like me, they may decide not to beat themselves up over the times the thought becomes powerful.  We are after all, only who we are, and it doesn't mean that by the end of this sentence we all aren't something else, though still who we are.

You took a suggestion, an opinion, and you turned it into ""if this isn't how you're doing it, then your not actually spiritual, your just egotistical"".  That's not yours to take.  And BTW, you don't have a clue if that's true for anyone, maybe not even you.  Please, for everyone's safety, don't do things like that if you're able.  People are trying to free themselves from a world where they have spent their lives being made thoughtless zombies.  We don't need to start the process all over again here with you telling them what the only real spirituality is.  


Damn, one moire thing.  I've made myself do at times some things that really played to my insecurities.  I did it because I was ready to, because it felt like the time.  Please don't dare push people by suggesting they go our and face their fears.  Maybe they don't want to yet.  Maybe they don't feel like it's the right time.  Maybe they will never ever ever decide to give that speech.  And you know what?  It's A-Okay and they can still become as wise and spiritual as anyone ever has.  No one is less than for the method they choose, and no one is more than because they went out and faced a fear, especially when they still lack the understanding that you don't come here and tell others like you know a fact they must follow.

awakened,f8v362q,t3_c4gvwc,1574857690.0,"In America, do you know that until you turn 14 your chances of being killed by a gun are greater than killing yourself, and that once you turn 14, and then for the rest of your life, your chances of killing yourself are 6 times greater than dying from a gun?  About 10,000 people a year in the US die from non self-inflicted gunshot wounds.  About 1.5 MILLION people every year in the US attempt suicide with roughly 70,000 succeeding.  A lot of them were going to doctors.  A lot of them had been in psychiatric clinics.

I'm sorry for the loss of your friend. However I think deciding who *may* have ""mental illness"" not  a thing anyone better ever dare do to me, and it's not a thing I am going to do to someone else - especially here.

What people come to this reddit for is understanding.  It's to make some sense about at least part of the scary, painful things they are feeling.  That's more personalized care than most will ever see from their psychologist or psychiatrist.  Psychiatrists who by and large spend 5 minutes a month with a person just to refill their prescriptions.  Is that because it's the most medically sound way of treatment?  Of course not.  It's so they can make more money.  Think I'm jaded?  Then go to any one of their conventions and listen to them laugh at and tease the few psychiatrists that still believe in seeing their patients for an hour of talk therapy.  The things they say when the laughter stops?  ""But you would be making so much more money if you just saw them for 5 minutes"".  No thank you.  Most people, including doctors, are not very good at what they do.  Doctors unfortunately are also one of the few species more arrogant than me.  At least I'm very good at what I do.  By and large they would not nurture or support the things someone goes through as they wake up.  By and large they would put them on meds, tell them those things were in their head, and most likely put them into some kind of CBT or DBT so they could stop the ""bad"" thoughts about themselves.  


I don't tell people they need to go see doctor's, because that demeans, dismisses, and doesn't allow for their experience to be real - which it might be.  Now if someone comes in and says they are going to hurt someone else or themselves I may try to understand what's happening and sure, if  they said they were going to kill the neighbors kids I would take some action.  But if they are in too much suffering to continue, I will both give them the best advice I can, but also make sure they know that no one blames them for doing what they decide to do - because someone already feeling that bad doesn't need to feel worse.

It is, I agree, dangerous to give people advice - especially when one doesn't make it clear that even if it's what they experienced it doesn't mean it's true for the other person.  This again because most people do not yet know how to fully think for themselves.  So if someone comes here for help and they are told to go see a doctor then the group that is supposed to offer understanding which usually will give someone strength, has just basically invalidated their experience and thrown them back into the very blind rules of the world they are in the process of trying to break free from - a world that will give no credence to their very real experience and instead label it as crazy by and large.

I had weeks during my awakening where I thought the entire world could read my mind and I was a robot - a science experiment for people to watch (yeah try psyching yourself up to go to the market when that's your reality).  Oh yeah, everyone was also trying to telepathically give me a heart attack whenever I left my house and I also thought people were beaming TV shows directly to my TV because every damn episode seemed to have to do with what was happening to me.

At the time (I was only 21) my Mother had me see a psychiatrist who told her I was schizophrenic and there was no chance I'd ever be the way I used to be.  Fortunately I didn't believe him or it could have done real damage to me.  Unfortunately my mom had to go through that horror until she saw it wasn't true.  Sure I don't blame the guy as he was blind and didn't understand when I said I crows would follow me like they were trying to give me a message - so of course he was telling me how that was part of my sickness.  That is until 5 seconds into the sickness speech 2 crows landed on his balcony and started crowing loudly at him.  Now the look on his face, forever priceless.  I said excitedly ""Just like that!"" and his mouth snapped shut, his eyes had that confused look as it tried to reconcile the odds of what just happened, and he turned around and sat back at his desk.  


Then there was the time at 21 I tried explaining to my mom the signs I was seeing everywhere.  At the time 999 was huge for me - I'd especially see it in license plates and I told her so.  She was of course in tears because obviously I had lost my mind.  So we leave the restaurant and are taking the escalator down to the parking garage in silence when I shout ""Mom - just like that!"".  And what am I shouting about?  The car that's parked right in front of the escalator with the license plate ""999"".  That was 22 years ago and to this day she has never forgotten it.  


Most people don't yet have the inner strength to be able to stand up for themselves against Doctors, and parents, and spouses, and children.  It is hard when what is happening doesn not usually materialize for others to see.  It is hard when you live in a society that no matter how many times science says Pluto is or isn't a planet, everyone just goes ""oh sure, okay, not a planet"".  And the vast majority of Doctors are too arrogant and ignorant (I said most) to think anything could be happening that wasn't in one of their textbooks.  


Side story.  I had a friend, his wife always angry about his drug use.  He had two kids too.  So yet again he is shipped of to rehab, because of course no one thinks what kind of pain he might be trying to numb.  1 month later he returns ""A new man"" and everyone feels very satisfied with themselves.  Then one day he puts on his suit and tie for work, shaves, goes to his garage, and hangs himself.  Now he too is dead.

And now, the indignant, arrogant, outrage can start.  Not to worry, it doesn't bother me.

So I think it's just a painful reminder when the best anyone had to offer was breathing deep, mindfulness, or shock treatment, and of course doctors being what they are, it takes them 100 times longer than everyone else to materially better their care, since they spend their days dismissing empirical evidence and disregarding new data, because of course no one is less worthy of an opinion or an idea than their patient (huh, guess I really do have quite a lot and anger towards doctors.
