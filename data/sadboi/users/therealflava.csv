Also, I know Roo is an extra day longer than Coachella and the dates for Roo are June 11-14 this year, so is camping the same as Coachella as in driving in the day before (Wednesday the 10th) and leaving Monday the 15th? Also how is security compared to Coachella? I got pretty lucky last year, this lady literally didn’t even search my car and kind of just gave me a “dont be an idiot look” lol. But I recognize that’s totally not always the case so I’d just like to know what to expect! :)"
bonnaroo,fe6l93s,t1_fe6ic0c,1578894652.0,"You’re probably right, the drive to Coachella was only about ~8 hours and that alone almost killed me. The way there was fun with anticipation of course, but I literally almost gave up on the way back, especially in the last 30 miles or so. I’m looking at flights now and they were much cheaper than when I checked the other day! They fluctuate so much I’ll just have to keep an eye out for a good deal and snag it asap!!

Thanks for your input :-))"
iilluminaughtii,fdpr7d6,t3_eiyufw,1578637407.0,"Honestly if you feel you are close enough with that friend and her brother then I’d say just try to expose him to the realities of the company, like this sub and all kinds of other things you can find on Google. They’ve had a lawsuit (maybe more) opened against them for essentially false advertising, and overall most people I see on threads like these have had a negative experience. The only downside to trying to show your friend and her brother the truth is that he might be just as much of a cult-like believer in the company as most of the reps are. Let me tell you my experience. 

About a month ago this girl randomly reached out to me on Facebook, literally someone who I do not know at all (red flag 1) but had mutual friends with and she was also from my hometown. She basically gave me this whole pitch of “would you like to learn ways to make more money?” “watch this 2 min video” “take this quick survey” etc etc. (red flag 2) She eventually ended up asking if I had 30 mins to talk to her on a FaceTime-like app where she could screen share with me. Let me just say that I have pretty bad social anxiety so the thought of FaceTiming with an absolute stranger was mortifying to me. I seriously don’t know what got into me at that moment, the person I am would’ve normally never agreed to do something like this let alone even engage in a conversation like this with some random person on Facebook. I had a bad feeling all along but I thought “hey why the hell not see what she has to say, worse comes to worse it’s just a scam and you say no” Well first of all let me start by saying it was nowhere near 30 mins. The presentation itself was an hour long of her literally dragging on about topic after topic on this company, discount this, residual income that, etc. Anyway at the end she pressured the HELL out of me to join this thing, she was very aggressive and of course, in class mlm fashion didn’t mention that there was a “monthly membership fee” in addition to a “one-time fee” of like $100 minimum until the very end of the presentation. Obviously I should’ve known better because it seemed way too good to be true. She literally said to me, and I quote, “We don’t accept maybes, it’s yes or no.” very aggressively. Along with many, many other guilt-trips and jabs at 9-5ers, and how I would basically be an idiot for letting this opportunity pass, I could quit my job and retire in my 20s, etc. Literally all bullshit and I’m sick to my stomach even looking back on it honestly. 

Well, me being the anxious person I am and HORRIBLE in pressure/on-the-spot situations, I was like sure, I’ll join, but I’m doing the very minimum standard membership to see what it’s all about first. She was overly-excited about me joining which was another red flag. Come to find out she is directly benefiting from me joining, along with everyone else above her who gets paid for recruiting people. The main thing that sold me on this was that if you get 4 friends to join you get your monthly fees waived and essentially stay a member for free forever. I thought I could easily do that as I know many people who I THOUGHT (at the time) would be interested, and I’m usually pretty good with persuading my friends into trying new things. I’m not exaggerating when I say I reached out to almost EVERYONE I KNOW, at first just people who I thought would be interested in traveling, but then I got desperate and reached out to almost everyone I know. No one was interested, people flaked on the FaceTime calls, only one of my girlfriends ended up joining the FaceTime call eventually and basically straightup just said no. Lmao. I felt so fucking stupid and embarrassed for even reaching out to so many people I know looking like one of those basic ass mlm bitches that I never wanted to become and always laughed at. I know this post is getting long but bare with me here. 

About a week after I joined I went to a meeting kinda thing in my hometown (about 40 mins from where I live) which basically ended up being the same exact presentation I was given through FaceTime. I was kinda irritated because I was there til almost 10 pm on a weekday (I work 8-5 M-F and I have an hour commute EACH way to work) so I basically drove 40 mins after getting off a long ass day at work just to sit there and get pitched the same crap I saw in the beginning. I also ended up getting pressured into upgrading my membership as well which cost another $100. At this point I’m $250 deep in this shit, so I was really clinging onto any fucking string of hope I had left. I’m a fucking idiot I know, I already knew that but typing this all out just makes me feel even worse and more embarrassed of myself. 

Anyway since then I’ve been added into various group chats where they literally just blow me up all day long about FaceTime calls with “top earners” and once-in-a-lifetime meetings with the CEO (which are advertised every few weeks LMAO) The girl who recruited me LITERALLY, and I mean literally texted me almost every single day, multiple times a day, down my fucking THROAT trying to get me to find people to join. I was honestly so exhausted from work but I really wanted to believe this whole thing would work out so I tried. I really fucking did for about 2 weeks and saw literally nothing happen, whereas this girl is just recruiting people left and right and benefiting from it in some way. I finally kinda stopped answering her texts within the last week or so and now her husband texts also me all the time, overall the whole thing is VERY pressure-based and cult-like, as many people say. The ironic part is a majority of them are die-hard Christians and center their whole ideal around God. I have no problem with religion whatsoever but I myself am personally not religious so that definitely made me feel a little alienated also. 

Anyway, to make a long fucking story short I feel extremely embarrassed, cheated, and I’m also out of $250 plus some of my own valuable time. My “monthly fee” is coming up in a few days because I havent recruited anyone so I’m getting ready to text this chick tomorrow and let her know it’s not working for me. I was going to just tell her I can’t do it anymore and leave it at that, but I honestly kinda wanna give her a piece of my mind, in a respectable way of course. Like “hey, you were kind of misleading by making me think I could make all this money from this company when in reality it literally takes more time, effort, and dedication than a real 9-5 job, except with less payoff.” But I don’t know if I should. Obviously I am just as responsible for falling for it and I know that, like I said I seriously don’t know what the hell got into me at that time, I would normally NEVER fall for something so stupid like this. The kind of person I am, I would’ve immediately jumped into researching the company but I didn’t until recently, and I think part of it was just denial and not wanting to admit that I got fucking played. I would feel really bad for “going off” on her in a sense because she really is a sweet girl, and regardless of it works for her or not, I’m just not that kind of person but at the same time I’m pretty fucking pissed off that I wasted $250 that I don’t even have to begin with. I had to wait until I got paid to even join in the first place because I had virtually no money when we talked. I’m a 19 year old living on my own with my boyfriend, working my ass off for what I have so I really just feel cheated and embarrassed more than anything. I love to travel, have been to multiple countries in the past but I just should’ve known better with this one. Anyway, this has kind of just turned into a long emotional rant for me but I wanted to share my experience with others on here maybe considering joining the company, or even just reading for a good laugh. 

Moral of the story: if ANYTHING in life sounds too good to be true, IT IS. Not probably, but definitely. 

And trust me, I know how stupid I am for this and how I am equally at fault for joining without doing my research first. I’m honestly glad this happened though because I will never even consider anything even relatively similar to an mlm again. If it sounds anything like one, count me the fuck out. Lesson. Fucking. Learned. 

I’m honestly just a little nervous to see how this lady will respond because she is so damn aggressive. Lol"
the1975,fdksm02,t3_ejwhg8,1578510299.0,Does anyone know if you have to be living IN London/Europe to apply? I'm in the states but I will happily give up my entire 2020 tax return to fly out there. Lmao

Coachella,fd08z1k,t1_fcz95yj,1578115412.0,"I’m not mad at all either! More than anything it just seems like a bit of a cash-grab in the midst of the whole “Hot Girl Summer” thing still trending. I actually like Megan the Stallion a lot, I think she’s a very talented female rapper, and although they wouldn’t be my first choices for rappers it’ll also be pretty cool to see Brockhampton, Travis Scott, and Denzel Curry. There are a few other good ones too but all the others just seem excessive and cash-grab-y, especially in comparison to previous lineups. If that makes sense, lol. 

I’m glad Coachella is accommodating (or at least trying) for everyone’s music taste. Just want them to stay true to their indie/rock/pop roots and everything else in between, rather than just piling a bunch of mainstream big-names together whose, IMO, music isn’t all too lyrical or interesting. Like I said though, just my own opinion. I sincerely hope no one takes offense to anything I’ve said. 

Back to City Girls though, I’m not sure if they have been popular amongst fests lately as I have personally never seen them on a lineup before. Who knows, they might put on a good show, but in all honesty I’m just a littttttle concerned with the type of crowd they might attract."
Coachella,fcytzgy,t3_ejl1ze,1578087037.0,"Probably going to get a lot of shit for this, but I just feel like there are wayy too many mainstream rappers and not enough indie/rock. I have no problem with rap whatsoever but City Girls, really? It just seems like every year they are leaning more and more towards cash-grabs for big names. Many will probably disagree but I honestly think last year had a pretty good balance between most genres, I’m no Coachella pro though, this is just my own personal opinion. Nonetheless still excited to see a couple people off this years lineup and also curious to see who will be brought out as guests."
the1975,fb8qv6m,t3_eanri4,1576619761.0,Honestly I’ve always thought Antichrist was sooo so underrated. I’ve never really heard people talk about it much and always wondered why they don’t play it at shows. That was and always will be one of my top 3 favorites from them.

I really appreciate the support more than you know as I have really been feeling alone in this battle. I don’t have anyone to relate to on this topic specifically thus the reason I joined this community in the first place, I’m so glad I did. Thanks so much again for your support, hopefully we will be able to motivate each other through this crazy journey. :) it’s people like you that restore my faith in humanity! Haha"
leaves,f7cxyjy,t3_dvi9g5,1573602663.0,"From personal experience, I’ll tell you after a while it gets old. If you continue to smoke as much as you do (I did the same, going through an ounce every single week), your tolerance will only get higher = spending more money just to smoke more, just to get high. It won’t be as much of a treat/reward anymore rather than a lifestyle. I know in school they make it seem like weed is meth, and obviously it’s not but there are definitely some negative long-term effects of weed that people fail to mention. Over time it will begin to affect your memory/focus/attention span whether you notice it or not. Of course everyone is different but I’m just speaking from my own experience, I started really young too (13/14) and didn’t start actually smoking regularly everyday until I hit 16. I’m 19 now and I can already tell I need to make a change before this changes me permanently. I don’t enjoy it the same anymore, it’s sooo hard to get high, I’m constantly spending money or obsessing over weed, etc. I say, if you really enjoy smoking weed, teach yourself to only use it as a reward (e.g. after homework, completing chores, etc.) or even just on weekends, but try to avoid smoking just to pass the time, or because there’s nothing else to do, or simply because it’s become a habit. Trust me, appreciate weed for what it is before you find yourself not even getting high off it anymore and just being depressed all the time. Sorry for the long paragraph lol"

leaves,f7cwzs5,t1_f7cv01t,1573601984.0,"Thank you so much for your support man you have no idea how much I appreciate it!! The tricky part for me is that bongs are the only thing that actually works anymore (sadly), so when I hit an all-green bowl, it’s just sooo harsh on my lungs and makes me cough like crazy and my face gets super hot. I already have asthma and for some reason it just makes my chest feel sooo tight when there’s only weed and I hate it so much. I know once my tolerance goes down I could probably enjoy getting high off joints or even pipe bowls again but as of right now those don’t affect me anymore. Thus the cycle of me going back to tobacco, because I always WANT to quit, but weed is usually too harsh by itself (since I’m so adjusted to the tobacco) which makes me not even want to smoke anymore, but at the same time I still want to smoke SOMEthing, if that makes any sense lol

The worst part is I literally use to be able to rip an entire bowl of greens back in the day and be perfectly fine and stoned to the bone after! But I think I’m just so used to the tobacco now that weed is unfortunately not the same anymore. 

Which just goes to show anyone who DOESNT smoke tobacco; stay the hell away from it. It’s definitely as addictive as they preach to you in school growing up, it’s even turned me off to my favorite plant in the entire world. Such a shame!"
leaves,f7cu9zi,t3_dvhzeb,1573600103.0,"Good for you!! I feel myself starting to hit that mental rock bottom as well. At this point I’ll do anything it takes to quit because I can already feel how much happier and productive I’ll be without it, not to add saving a ton of money, and stress on not having said money. But regardless, I definitely think I’ll miss it for a long, long time, if not for the rest of my life. That’s the only thing I’m currently worried about at the moment :/"
