unpopularopinion,fq4ga8u,t3_ggj5k7,1589077382.0,"This is why I chose Buddhism, it really zens you out with the universe around you. 

I grew up constantly suicidal with anger issues on the more impoverished side of life. Long story short I knew that no one gave a shit and I quickly became okay with that. I faced my storms alone which strengthened my mind. Safe to say I begun approaching life like a fucking Spartan or something. I don’t mean to shit on anyone’s feelings but if you are fighting suicidal thoughts the biggest reality check is realizing that someone is probably going through much worse than you. It takes a bit of ego death.

Yea it sucks that as a man in one of the most privileged countries on the planet no one cares about your personal issues. No one is meant to hold your hand and there are things that you’ll never be able to control. Keep your chins up, face your problems head on, and handle it. 

Easier said than done. I know. That’s just the way it is."

relationship_advice,fpspo39,t3_gf612u,1588877491.0,"Was in a similar situation. We were both models. I was better than her at it and would always support her. I had no clue why she was jealous of me, I thought we were a fucking awesome modeling couple. I thought we were killing it. Then it became very apparent that she was in competition with me when I received a “you’ve been selected to walk for yadda yadda event” and she didn’t. Her confidence turned off when I started getting more gigs, I could see it in her walk.

She started making mean ass comments under her breath and would call me crazy (gaslight) if I ever called her out on it. I caught her evil eye multiple times. It took me a while to realize that she was fake as fuck because I thought she was the “girl of my dreams.” News flash fellas, there is no girl of your dreams.

On top of that she was hating on me because I had no debt, my own apartment, a stable job, a lot of independent experience. Whenever Id try to teach her something it would backfire into her believing I thought she was stupid. I thought we were a team, turns out she was a snake in the grass.

TLDR: If you respect yourself, kick her to the curb. She’s jealous of you because she isn’t you. You make her feel insignificant because she feels that you are better than her. Stop making yourself crazy and leave this one alone. She’s got some growing up to do and you could be making better friends."

SuicideWatch,fnncivo,t3_g2jkre,1587089259.0,"I come from a narcissistic father and a reckless mother. Grew up in poverty, had some mental instabilities here and there. My old man was abusive, he hated himself and everything else. Felt like I had nothing to live for.

Fast forward, I return home from college. A drop out. Had a hard time there, racism on campus and a huge social divide between the student body. Some girl that would flirt back/forth with me told all my friends that I forced myself on her. Lost my friends. Anyways, came back home and started arguing with my dad again. Felt worthless. 

Fast forward he kicks me out. An old high school teacher let me stay in his basement, I was good friends with his sons in highschool. Got a good fucking dose of reality working 9-5 in fast food. It humbled me. I worked extra in order to afford my own place. Got my own place and the universe hit me even harder. My ego death wasn’t my most cherished experience, it made me hate life itself. I grew cynical.

Fast forward, I made an effort to put everything that was ailing me into a mental file cabinet and began focusing on what I where I saw myself in the future. Became a model. Decided to join the Navy. Looking forward to it.

My life has taught me resilience and endurance. Came from a fucked up childhood. Got shit on in highschool and college. BUT SHIT GOT BETTER. They only got better because I made them better instead of waiting. I was raised by wolves man. Trust me, it gets better if you’re patient with yourself."

relationship_advice,fnls5up,t3_g2cbnh,1587058794.0,"Ill keep it real as fuck with you chief. She likes the attention she gets from other guys. Ofcourse she wouldn’t tell you about it, Ofcourse she wouldn’t even hint at it. She found herself a guy that didn’t have a social media account, in that she knew she found a guy that couldnt judge what she was posting. And she’s milking that dry.

Bring it up to her, be frank. Put your foot down about whether you’re okay with it or not. Be direct and to the point or she’ll figure that she can walk over you. She had a reason for not showing you in the first place. Read between and BEHIND the lines.

Best of luck"

If I were you I’d cut my loss because the jealousy and loss of self respect really isn’t worth it. If you see yourself in the company of this girl for a long time, even *cringes* marriage then go forward. Just understand that you’re giving her permission to let other guys dick her down. What if she falls in love with having sex with someone else? I’m sure that would crush you. Then she’d be telling you that she’s going over some other guys house all the time. 

You do you but think about it. My best advice is to let this one go. Loss of self respect isn’t worth it."

socialskills,fgufeb7,t3_f0foks,1581119458.0,"Well it’s simple really. Use your minds eye. Take a look at yourself in the mirror and use your imagination to view yourself from a third person perspective. 
It gets rid of all anxiety and could help you view yourself and other people in a new light.
I wouldn’t know where to begin in explaining it but to keep it short; Get out of your own head.

Start to view life itself from a birds eye perspective. It’ll help you make decisions whether they are big or small.

Peace and love"
SuicideWatch,ff4ytis,t3_erhro1,1579575731.0,"Things don’t change or get better unless you put in the work. I don’t mean to sound like a dick and I don’t know your situation but if you’re able to make a change in your life then you have to take the step and change it whether someone is there to hold your hand through it or not. 
Life is nothing but ups and downs. Highs and lows. That goes for all of us on the planet. Say you overcome your current depression and begin to live happily for a while, you never know what life will throw at you to put you right back into that dark, depressing hole. But at the end of the day will you allow yourself to sink deeper or fight your way out despite the bullshit that keeps dragging you down? 
What usually gets me out of a rut is reminding myself that things could be a lot worse. I could be homeless, at war, blind, or (god forbid) have cancer. There’s an entire list of things shitty things that people go through on this planet that limit their lives. 
I’m not saying that whatever you’re going through is small because your feelings are valid but overtime with hard work and self discovery, it does get better. Patience and introspection is usually the key."
