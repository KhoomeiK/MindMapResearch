There are nicer places on reddit of you feel you need some validation. I wouldn’t say it has anything to do with your looks, some people just get off on pulling other people down."
AskReddit,fno993a,t1_fnnjmxn,1587116930.0,"Yeah, no. If you’re British fuck you is more likely to mean I like you, but you fucked up or I’m teasing. A true fuck you is more like ‘excuse me, could you not do that again please.’"
breakingmom,fnlkf4r,t1_fnl9shz,1587055058.0,"Yeah, this is who we should be angry with. No one bought 100 packs of flour/hand wash etc for personal use, not even if they were stocking up. There is a lot of profiteering going on on eBay and Amazon. Disgusting, and in my country, actually illegal."
beyondthebump,fnkrok7,t3_g2bt16,1587037960.0,"It does sound like an awful experience, but this is is typical for when ER is extremely busy. It won’t be this bad when they are not busy, and you would usually be in a children’s waiting area with toys which helps a lot with kids waiting. I don’t know if this is available in your country, but in mine our general doctor will have emergency appointments available same day for children, so with an issue like the one you had it would be possible to avoid ER."
todayilearned,fnk88ia,t1_fnjtnts,1587017986.0,"The wage gap that happens to mothers (through gaps in employment and part time working) is often due to couples deciding, yes, together, that the lower earning partner should work part time and look after their child part time. Reddit generally refuses to admit that the gender pay gap exists, because it is these days more often due to women working in lower paid jobs or industries rather than being paid a lower wage for the exact same job as a man, but it is there. And it matters a lot when decisions about who continues to work after having a child are made by individual couples."

AmItheAsshole,fneussn,t1_fner7wx,1586896223.0,"Mine too. I’m not allergic. Everyone’s vagina is a different shape inside, makes sense some don’t fit a tampon comfortably."
beyondthebump,fneivvz,t1_fnehr6b,1586890170.0,"First they lock themselves in and can’t get out, then they figure out the lock and lock themselves in and won’t come out."
beyondthebump,fnehmh0,t1_fnefstr,1586889524.0,"This worked until my son locked the door and my daughter needed the toilet and he wouldn’t let her in. Now the lock is off again, and they all come in constantly. Except only with me."
AmItheAsshole,fndf0qm,t1_fnddzx0,1586868385.0,"Yeah, and what those people do is put their relatives in a care home. Which is incredibly expensive. Because OP is saving the family a huge amount of money by providing live in care, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect the sister pitch in financially, both for everyday costs and the cost of hiring care so OP can have a vacation."
AmItheAsshole,fnd2w33,t1_fnbucbn,1586856597.0,"Yeah. My kids have the basics and my brothers kids live in a huge house. That’s life and it doesn’t bother me at all. If that was my kids dad in the huge house and we had a small flat? Yes, it would bother me and I would be asking for an increase in support. A parents income should be shared with the child, not just cover basic needs. And comment like he sometimes covers the rent when she can’t pay sounds like she can’t afford the basics either."
