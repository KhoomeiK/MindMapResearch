selfharm,fopicr3,t3_g8s45o,1587962264.0,"I self-harmed for the first time for a period of months in my late twenties. I couldn’t cope with the stress in my life and the feeling of failing. I had a lot going on that felt out of my control. I feel you - it doesn’t feel like we talk about adult harming. I’ve grabbed lots of stuff at the library to try and understand and a lot of it is geared towards teens. It is a very lonely experience. I haven’t cut for a while, but I still think about it."

Goruck,fiy3stq,t1_fivzvqy,1582831941.0,I have the gen-1s from their sale and they fit well enough in my regular converse size. I have a fairly flat foot and they're comfortable. Can't vouch for the new leather but did have a hot spot on my big toe during break-in. They don't look bulgy / no heel slippage.

depression,ffe9b3g,t3_eswd3w,1579840254.0,"I struggle with loneliness (especially in terms of self-comparison) myself. I think our loneliness stems from people we know not living our shared experience, not knowing what it's like to feel alone, and so on. Loneliness begets loneliness. When you want friendship, loneliness creeps up on you and creates bitterness. It's not easily resolved, and I don't think we'll ever gain full understanding or acceptance from the people that we want to like us. As rejected as we already feel, we still have to handle some of it.

I think there's some merit to ""running away."" In the sense that maybe your reputation with the people you work with, live with, whatever may not change immediately. That's gonna take some work. But given an honest try at making friends and acquaintances, faking confidence until you make it and all that, finding a new group of people to hang with might help you align with people who get you. You'll have an opportunity to be in a different light and it might just be what you need to get you out of the funk. Everyone's different, and this might mean doing some homework to do something new on Meetup or finding a Discord to hang out in. I've made pleasant company doing random free things like learning how to record documentary videos and sign language classes (the latter doesn't even require speaking and often ends up in lots of giggling).

For learning personal resilience, I like ""Resilient"" by Rick Hanson. It's a little woo-y, but has practical exercises. Emotional Intelligence 2.0 also helped me quite a bit in the workplace. Stoicism also helps me — check out Ryan Holiday's books too for short little life advice tips to keep on keeping on."
SuicideWatch,fcphofi,t3_eieayu,1577864544.0,"So my new year is starting with a lot of nasty financial affairs, an attorney, and classmates bailing on a student project. Don’t think I’ve used a block button on an inebriated family member before. It’s been a day.

I guess I feel like everyone has had a great decade. Twitter is full of praise, accomplishments, etc., and I see my 20s (concurrent with the decade) being wasted. It’s a shitty feeling to live with. That you haven’t gone anywhere and have been kind of spinning your wheels.

I earned a couple undergrads with nothing to show. Worked the same job for about seven years with nothing to show. Really no friends or people to lean on. No relationships. Suicide in a family that doesn’t talk to each other outside of funerals. I’m alone and have been feeling alone for a long time.

I’ve been going at this life thing and not getting anywhere, and I guess I’m tired? I’m trying to settle my financial affairs before I go which will take another year. It’s a weird place to be in. Wanting to move on yet being stuck because you don’t want to burden others.

Sometimes you just wish someone, anyone, would grab you and tell you that they care. Someone to just look you in the eye and mean it. To understand what you’re going through. Wrap an arm around ya kinda thing. As much therapy as I’ve been in... everything feels clinical. I want something real I guess.

Maybe moving away from everything would help. Right now I don’t know what that looks like or how I could afford it, or how it looks hitting 30 when I should have it figured it out in my 20s."
EVERGOODS,f04h2oh,t3_d3ghq2,1568387341.0,"It's funny you mentioned it'll be replacing the Errant — I still have that bag in brown and replaced it with the CPL24. I like the Errant's internal pockets and like it enough as a tech bag, but wasn't crazy about the dark interior or how the pockets expanded into the main cavity. Not crazy about the lid magnets. Wouldn't mind having a sailcloth one with the yellow interior for hiking. Not a bag for hitting the local library either way.

Super hype for the CHZ. Wish it was shipping sooner. I love my CPL but sometimes I just want to throw stuff in a bag and go and the CHZ looks perfect. Seems like a great replacement for something like the Osprey Flapjack. Casual enough to take everywhere and I'll keep the CPL around for personal carry when flying or when I'm staying overnight somewhere."
EVERGOODS,ezr1z44,t1_ezq390b,1568067154.0,"CHZ is more practical for me. The CPL would take a backseat for work and light travel use whereas the CHZ I would grab for weekends, about town, on a boat, etc. Actually really into the idea of sticking sandals or a bike lock in the outside pocket. Can still easily accommodate a laptop or tablet as well.

I currently and mostly use a small Camelback for most of my longer day hiking. Undecided between MQD and MPL, but leaning towards MPL. MQD seems great if you need to stow a helmet, such as for climbing. It’s definitely their most technical bag. MPL has much more space for longer treks. I want to do a multi-day kayak and hiking venture at some point and the MPL seems like the right fit."
EVERGOODS,ezpgn1t,t3_d11dm6,1568040284.0,"I own the CPL24 and the CTB40. I've traveled with them both and the CPL24 is my daily carry. I pre-ordered the CHZ22.

CPL24 I think could stand to be a little bit bigger. It's great for keeping spare clothes and shorts in a ""city friendly"" package with your work goodies - glasses case, laptop, etc. I like having a day bag where I can stay in a hotel overnight or change into date/rec clothes really quick. I don't use the internal ""papers"" sleeve a whole lot because it's hard to get to when the bag is packed, but I really like the laptop compartment. I use the CPL as a briefcase quite a bit and wish it had either a thicker or double handle like the CTB to better accommodate heavier loads. No issues with carrying a water bottle in the main compartment. I have taken the CPL hiking a little bit and have given the bag a bit of character. Sweat back is a thing. Have used as my personal item in flight as it fits under the seat. The internal top pocket is great for quick items like hand sanitizer, medicine, spare contacts, etc. The mesh pocket is great for things like travel deodorant, socks, charging cables, etc. Overall terrific bag and bomb quality. Would also like a better way to stow straps / webbing when using as a briefcase.

I ordered the CHZ because the CPL is a bit too formal for casual outings like the park and whatnot. Plus, the CPL really isn't a dump bag.

CTB40 I have mixed feelings on. I'm not really sold on the aesthetics, but I love the double handles and the internal layout. I went on a week long trip and was able to bring lots of extras like a blender bottle and workout gear in addition to my clothes. (Hey Evergoods - wanna make some innovative packing cubes?) Tossing it in overhead bins was great. Laptop compartment is tight when fully packed. I do love the internal divider for that pocket and wish a future CPL will copy that design choice. I was carrying both the CTB and CPL at the airport and thought, ""You know, I'm a big dude but I just want to drag this thing."" Especially when your terminal is all the way across the airport. Again build quality is top notch. Loved being able to unfold it / lay it out at my destination and get at items as needed. Doesn't seem to have the same coating as newer CTBs because it definitely attracts more fuzz and dust. What I kind of want is a CTB bag on wheels like Osprey does with some of their bags. A ""Civic Wheeled Transporter."" Otherwise, same great quality if not better in some areas.

I have my nitpicks having used these products for a while but Evergoods stuff is my fave right now. I've had some other high-end bags from other companies like Boundary and they're nice but Evergoods definitely nailed simplicity + form and how their pockets don't eat up additional internal storage space.

I think they could nail a duffel gym + bag. Shoes, gloves, tape, etc."
EVERGOODS,es9x0h6,t3_c6fous,1561746440.0,"I thought I would miss having a water bottle pocket but I don't. Have flown with the CPL24 as my personal item so I've tossed it around a fair bit. I keep a spare pair of casual jeans or shorts in the main pocket with sandals for when I end up going out after work, then a hardback or paperback book or two with a water bottle (Klean Kanteen or Yeti) on the side. Fitted both a 20 and 26 OZ comfortably. I leave the zippers in a corner to get quick access. I find the water bottle doesn't move around, but I have my pack pretty well packed. Honestly haven't considered a leak, but I trust the seal on my water bottles. In the event that it happened I can't see the laptop compartment being affected.

&#x200B;

Besides, when I think of a water bottle leak I don't think of a catastrophic failure. I think of maybe the seal needing replacement and there being some drips down the side or something like that."
