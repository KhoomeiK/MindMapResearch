EOOD,fqaxjw6,t3_ghme63,1589227004.0,"My goals were:

* run at least 1 mile

* do at least 1 (half-assed partial ROM is great) pullup

* work a little bit on that project that I'll never tell anyone about because it's just for me

* do my chores

* drink at least 2 glasses of water

What I've learned:

* If I don't run I don't sleep.

* Paradoxically, it might be better to do ""more"" in the sense of aiming for a full workout because that seems more worthwhile. At any rate it felt pointless.

* I don't know what that was but it was Scary and I need to fucking drink.

Revised goals:

* Run a mile every day

* Work out three times a week.

* Log water in cronometer so I at least know how I'm doing even if it's not enough.

* Work a little bit on that project.

* Do my chores. That actually makes me feel accomplished because other people depend on it."

Nailed it. It's so frustrating when everyone wants you to be ~kind~ to yourself and it's like, no, I need to do this. I can't just wait to get better, that's not how recovery works. This *is* kindness."

EOOD,fphacoe,t3_gdafk0,1588617749.0,"My therapist and I have been working on mindfulness lately. Like today I said I feel like such and such, and then I went on to talk about that, but that's not right. You say you feel the way, and then you just stop. I'm proud of myself for finally getting that. Cause she always said to not pass judgement but it never felt like judgement, i was just expanding on it. But mindfulness is just the first part. It's not much but I'm proud of myself for finally figuring it out (and we are not going off and saying that this is simple and I should have figured it out sooner)."
BingeEatingDisorder,fpfpnbr,t3_gczncr,1588578985.0,"when i was a kid I'd always - not binge, but eat too much, more than was appropriate, of junk food when it was available because we *never* got that at home. so I'd eat it all because god only knows when I'd get it again. idk what my mom could have done differently though. the best way to set the kid up for success is to feed them healthy food in correct quantities so they never get a taste for junk food, because it's actually gross if you're not used to it. I've always been a mess though."

BingeEatingDisorder,fpa501n,t1_fp918al,1588440930.0,">For women, a lack of food triggers hormones that tell our bodies to conserve and store energy (fat) to protect offspring, while for men it triggers hormones for energy to go hunt and kill shit. They burn fat, we store it.

nobody's body stores fat while eating in a deficit. *nobody's*. both men and women experience metabolic adaptations in a calorie deficit that include reduction in non-exercise activity thermogenesis (unconscious movement) and adaptive thermogenesis (your body conserving what energy it can, a 15% change in the minnesota starvation experiment (just don't eat only half your caloric needs while doing hard labor and you're good)). but fat is an energy source and burning it when it needs energy is what every body, regardless of hormones, does. 

now, studies have shown that women can expeience side effects like amenorrhea from intermittent fasting and should stick to 14 or 16 hour fasting windows or not fast every day, but they'll still lose fat with it *because that's how bodies work*.

don't hate science."
GetOutOfBed,fp59z8j,t3_gayxxs,1588321545.0,"you should bring it up with a doctor when you can. i have a circadium rhythm disorder that makes it so i always feel tired no matter how much i slept if i get up early but feel fine even on even 4 hours of sleep if i get up later. i'm also so afraid of the dark i can't sleep at night and am like suicidally depressed so i think i'm in a good position to offer help!

so what helped me was never having any caffeine. it makes me feel like shit so that was easy for me. 

f.lux on your computer and twilight on android (idk for iphone, i think they have one built in but i don't know if it's strong enough, the one built into my phone does almost nothing) to filter blue light. it helps me feel sleepier at night. turning the brightness ( and the room lights) down too. 

seconding the recommendation for an alarm with a captcha. mine has me shake the alarm, but i've set it to require me to walk around before. i had a qr code but i can get up and scan it and go back to bed without waking up enough to remember it so ymmv. my alarm app will let me set multiple captchas so i never know what i'm going to get, i should set that up again. 

i also set piles of alarms. i know you've said you tried it, but you can't have too many. i also find that setting them for irregular intervals helps, also for not setting them more than 10 minutes apart. i usually set mine for 3 or 5 minutes apart, but i once set 5 in a row each a minute apart. i also change them every few days so i can't get used to it. 

i've found i just need a ridiculous amount of sleep. i slept 10 hours a day in school. now i sleep 12 because it's not like it matters. 

i also try to make sure that there is *nothing* i need to do in the morning other than leave. that way i can stay in bed until the absolute last possible second. 

try to work your way up to waking up at the desired time by no more than an hour a night. otherwise you get social jetlag and that gives you brain damage, because of course it does. 

wtf is this essay, i just wanted to say see a doctor."
selfhelp,fp58cq2,t3_gb1jv4,1588319859.0,"i'm 23. i had to drop out of college because i couldn't hack it, i've never had a job, i haven't spoken to anyone who isn't my mother, my therapist, or my doctor in over a year. there is so much i simply don't know, all those soft skills that no one can apparently teach me. i'm so far behind. people warn people to stay away from people with bad social skills or who are immature and i just keep getting further behind. i was always told growing up that my dad failed by not leaving his parents' house until he was 30 but they tell me that somehow it's different for me as if he didn't have  a crippling mental illness too.

i just want to be useful. i hate being a burden. i'm gonna kill myself if i haven't graduated college and gotten a job by 25.

i was going to apply to jobs training and placement but now there's a plague and honestly i can't even make it to therapy on time or wash the dishes every day so it's not like i can have a job anyway. fuck if i know how to fix this, shit's just gotten worse this year. (it's almost like keeping someone in nearly complete social isolation doesn't help them develop necessary social skills. but hey, they've been doing this to me my whole life. i've been systematically set up to fail so idk why i thought i'd get to do anything with my life). i can make this end, i'm just a coward, so i guess i'll just keep draining society's resources trying to fix something beyond repair. 

op, my brother is an engineer, a really good one. it took him 5 years to graduate college and he's working on the one thing he always said he'd never do. one of his friends in college was four or five years older than everyone else because she went back and got another bachelor's degree in something practical after her first that she did for fun. i knew a guy who was 30 and finally starting his bachelor's degree. i can't remember what his delay was, i know he'd been working though. 

as long as you have social skills you're doing great."
EOOD,fp529zu,t3_ga9y7g,1588314015.0,"here's some alternatives to strengthen your core that you can do until you can do a situp again:
* deadbugs: move your arms and legs as much or as little as you can to adjust the difficulty. 
* planks: do them on your knees or with you hands on a chair or the wall to make them easier. there're plank workout apps if you like following an app.
* leg lifts: you can make them easier by not fully lowering or raising your legs or by bending your knees. these are the most similar to situps.

there're more ab exercises of course but those are easier than a situp."

EOOD,fp4u9xl,t3_gb3vez,1588307553.0,"i have no idea why but sometimes i feel *awful* after runs or workouts. yesterday i was crying in the kitchen wanting to die. i just finished the run and just like that, suicidal despair. 

but the despair didn't last an hour like yours. it was like 20 minutes maybe? it was just sudden switch flip and it was gone. afterwards i didn't feel great and i had a nasty headache but idk.

i did eat afterwards, both carbs and protein like the other poster suggested. so maybe that helped. i can't think of any reason why this would happen, but at least it's not just you, right?"
