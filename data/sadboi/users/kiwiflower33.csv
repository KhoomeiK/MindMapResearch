bipolar,fm4lnsp,t3_fsrzdy,1585756442.0,"I was looking at old pictures recently and saw who I used to be. I used to have friends and I used to be a nurse, but now all I have is one friend and I had to give up my carreer because I just can't function like I used to... life is tough but we have to fight through it! Hang in there, we're here for you!"
bipolar,fjkifd2,t3_fdt2eh,1583427437.0,"I've always been an intense type of person, being completely outgoing and funny and everyone's best friend. Then aldulthood kicked in. It started with fits of anxiety where I couldn't feel my arms anymore (that was very scary) and then depression set in to the point that I tried to commit suicide 2 times. Eventually I started to retreat from my life and went into very self destructive behavior I had a lot of energy and was hell bent on destroying my life. I was hypomanic at that time and after I had mixed episodes. I was hospitalized for a month. It's only when I was put on mood stabilizers that I really started doing better. I was diagnosed borderline personality disorder and bipolar 2. Medication has really helped because I had lost all control on my life. Since then I've been working and fighting depression and anxiety like crazy. But last month anxiety has gotten the best of me..."
bipolar,figs2bz,t1_fi8230u,1582402908.0,"Thank you very much! :-) I've been painting for a couple of years now and I had classes in high school. Art is something very personal and from my experience, it takes a lot of time and practice to be able to make exactly what you want it to be! But, considering art for.therapy is about just trying to let go of whatever is burdening you and to just focus on what you want to do. What I perticularly recommend is to find a subject that interests you, a medium to represent it in and just... let go! Using art for therapy is more about representing what's inside than making something pretty"
bipolar,figq17e,t1_fi8tjia,1582402412.0,"Thanks! What I recommend is to try and find an image that speaks to you. I just love elephants and I love the colors I used so I decided to paint a subject that I love with colors that I love. Other than that, just paint the way that feels the most natural to you, it's ok if it doesn't look like what you have in mind... actually, none of.my paintings ever look like what I want them to.... and it gives them a certain charm! Be patient and just improvize and you'll have a unique art piece!"
bipolar,fdh8zws,t1_fde2lfy,1578417983.0,"I hadn't thought of it that way. I don't want my life to crash down because I have worked so hard to bring it back up. It's true that we want to escape the diagnosis, like a lot of people, I wish I were ""normal"" and didn't need the meds."
bipolar,fdh8l49,t1_fdenmp4,1578417732.0,"I guess I don't completely accept the diagnosis, which is probably why I second guess the medication. I don't know personally anyone who has this condition so it's hard for me to consider wether the way I was acting was off compared to others. I asked my doc a while back and she told me that I was a mild bipolar type 2... it's hard to believe that when you've been doing good for a while!"
bipolar2,fde52sk,t3_ekwokb,1578331359.0,"I really wish for you that Lamictal be as much of a game changer as it has been for me. Being diagnosed Bipolar can be rough, but now that your situation has a name, you'll get the proper treatment. I wish you luck through all this!"
BPD,f3fdhn0,t3_dgv8zl,1570895329.0,"The diagnosis can be scary and I don't know for you, but when I received it I automatically started analyzing every single moment in my life when I'd been kind of off. There is hope and there are treatments. I hit the bottom two and a half years ago, got the proper care and now I'm working and things haven't been so good in many years. Just breathe and repeat until you realize that that's all you have to do when things are overwhelming. Take care and I wish you the best!"

BPD,f0vyyc7,t3_d6rdv6,1568995132.0,"I was first diagnosed with chronic dysthimia when I saw my family physician, then I had MAJOR anxiety problems then I broke. I had a very severe depression and eventually I had self harm ideation. I went ahead and tried to commit suicide two times and then I was diagnosed BPD. My doctor just wrote the diagnosis on an insurance form which I read at home and was not properly explained. Since then I have seen multiple doctors and the concensus is that I really am BPD. It was a shit way of finding out and I still don't believe it is accurate..."
BPD,f0vtt38,t3_d6vxi5,1568991612.0,"Completely with you on this. Four years ago I was diagnosed BPD, but I didn't quite fit the criteria (according to me anyways) The criteria is very, VERY subjective and is not very linear. Say, if you are a very emotional person from a very calm backround, you stick out like a sore thumb and of course you would think something is off. I've heard a multiple of times that there is like 1% of people that are BPD. But I guess the docs use that diagnosis to justify certain therapy. At the end of the day, it's not about the diagnosis but about if the treatment is working or not."
GetMotivated,ezwxv15,t3_d2tqd0,1568227561.0,Yes I did it! :-)
BPD,ewsmmp2,t3_cpsjet,1565730691.0,"Yes, I have a lot of difficulty knowing what I like, what I'm good at and other things that say who I really am. I'm constantly trying to imitate someone that I look up to. I wonder what could cause this! It's almost like personality amnesia!"
nursing,ew74zm9,t3_cmx5pm,1565186243.0,"I used to care for people, empathize with them and their suffering. Now, because we are short staffed and our ratios not safe, I'm just glad nobody died during my shift at the end of the day. Don't get me wrong, I am very conscientious at work and do the best I can every day for my patients. To me, patients are like, stroke lady, lung cancer guy, broken hip guy, etc. Humanity has been sucked out of the profession for me..."

BorderlinePDisorder,eun2y2k,t3_cgz79r,1563923557.0,"Have you ever heard of intuitive eating? Basically it's learning to respect what your body needs. It may take time but it really is worth it! I've been losing weight for a while now and as someone who is VERY prone to self sabotage, I have to say it's been doing little miracles! No more binge eating and once you get the hang of it, it's really easy. It is not a diet, consider it a new way of seeing food. Nothing is off limits but the key is to just learn how to listen to your body and you'll be losing weight with not much effort! Seriously, I REALLY recommend it!"
bipolar2,esqygcz,t3_c8xq3p,1562212500.0,"It was a real game changer for me, it really helped to stabilize my moods and everything started going uphill from there. The effects vary from one person to the next so I truly wish you all the best with it!"
BorderlinePDisorder,escnk2p,t3_c72fvl,1561834000.0,"It actually is possible to have both. For example, I've had multiple episodes of major depression and they considered that I was in hypomania when my BPD symtoms became VERY severe for a couple of weeks. Hope this helps!"
BorderlinePDisorder,erql0tx,t1_erqgb3b,1561145867.0,"Thank you so much for your reply :-)
Anger and anxiety have been pretty bad lately and you're right when you say it's hard to control them. I am currently on meds and I do have a psychiatrist. In february we changed up the meds because my husband and I have been trying to conceive. Since about mid March I've become more and more irritable and I'm constantly thinking that people dislike me for whatever reason. I know I'm not well right now and it's frustrating because I feel that if I just kicked myself in the butt I'd be doing a lot better. But right now I easily get overwhelmed. I'm hanging on because I do want to be a mom. But I feel as if I'm one foot in giving up and self-harming and the other foot barely hanging on..."
bipolar,erpvgls,t3_c36cd6,1561128963.0,"Amazing Ted talk, thank you so much for sharing! üíñ"
bipolar,erh8w4b,t3_c1wvtw,1560869986.0,"I believe that there is a stigma with this illness, but it's all a question of attitude. I'm not saying to be proud of it and to shout it out loud, it's your business and the important people in your life. It is part of you, you wouldn't go around screamin that you love the color brown, so why is being BP any different? Talk to the people you trust and if they really matter, they will stick around. I know that when my family found out they were relieved to finally know what was up with me. They helped me see that there is hope to find balance with the proper help and medications. You are a unique person and whether there is stigma around it or not, just accept it and not let it define you! Best of luck in the future friend!"
intuitiveeating,ereh18y,t3_c1fex1,1560783903.0,"Hi! Ex-overeater here! A couple of years back I did this method and it REALLY helped me to get into intuitve eating. I don't know for you, but I was WAAAAY out of wack, like, I'd starve myself for a couple of hours (because, let's face it, I have had body issues, like everybody else!) And then I would binge eat anything and after I disgusted myself and starve myself and eat, rinse and repeat. So I saw a specialist and she told me to eat 5 to 6 times a day (I know, very counter intuitve but bare with me!) 3 meals with all the food groups and 3 snacks with protein and carbs (for the long acting sugar they contain). She told me to get into a regular eating schedule and eat as much as I needed to as long as I followed her recomendations. So that's what I did. I thought I'd gain a whole lot of weight and then something wonderful happened. I did this for 3 weeks and then I noticed that the snacks and meals became smaller as time passed. I ate regularly and my body started to understand the quantity and the quality of food it actually needed. And to be honest, I haven't felt starved or full since then! Because, when we eat beyond our starving state that's when the shit hits the fan and we overeat. So, I hope this will help you! You can do this!!"
bipolar,eref4yk,t3_c1myzu,1560782513.0,"Being on this subreddit, we often talk about our meds. I've been wondering, is lamictal 200mg twice a day too much? What about latuda 80mg everyday? Wellbutrin? Modafinil 200 mg? I can't help feeling like I'm waaaay overmedicated. According to my psych, I am a very mild BP2. If it's so mild, then why the heck am I taking all that? I'm still very doubtful on whether or not I truly am bipolar! I often get the feeling that maybe if I just meditated, ate clean, worked out and basically got my head out of my ass, I'd be ok!"
bipolar,ercdakj,t3_c1bozg,1560709098.0,Congratulations!!! I did exactly the same! You are awesome
nursing,er8sc7r,t3_c0x6qd,1560610832.0,"A couple of months back, we had a pimp that was pending a trial and that had pulled a knife on one nurse of another department. He was clearly dangerous for the staff, so the manager gave out very specific instructions for treating this person. I had to take care of him and was told to keep it as short and sweet as necessary. Which was ok, but I only did what I had to do and nothing more, trying to treat this man like any other, but as far as small talk goes, that was zero. So my advice to you is to keep it professional, do what you have to do, you don't have to be friends with him."
bipolar,er5i1c8,t3_c0kql6,1560526450.0,"This definitely sounds like eps, you really should consider seeing another doctor soon, seeing as it can become permanent."
bipolar,er5eq2j,t3_c0fuz7,1560524491.0,"Same here! Was in a terrible mixed state for almost a month with alot of suicidal ideation. Finally my Psych got me on lamotrigine and it's only been uphill from there! It's now been 2 years since I was hospitalized and I am so greatfull that life is more bearable (still get those highs and lows, but they aren't half of what they used to be!). So glad to hear that you are doing good!!! ^_^"
bipolar,epwfpvt,t3_bw4tuu,1559574682.0,"I believe that it is more than possible to be in a long term relationship. I've had BP2 symptoms since I was 17 and met my husband around those years. 2 years ago I finally got my diagnosis and proper treatment. Since then there have been many highs and lows but my husband is so different from me, he's calm and always the voice of reason so he calms me down when I go hypomanic and he's always there when I go into depression. I think that in order to be in a long term relationship, you need to find someone that is constant and patient! I really hope you get to have such a person in your life!"
bipolar,epr4tqx,t1_epqxotx,1559418332.0,"I had bad akathisia when I started taking Latuda 60, I was prescribed Benztropine and it completely stopped. After about 2 months on benztropine my psychiatrist weened me off and since then all has been good! I am currently on latuda 80 and all is good! Good luck!"
pregnant,ep5cwtz,t1_eorrcxy,1559053887.0,"Thank you so much, I'm actually praying for things to go like that! Congrats to you! üò∏üò∏üò∏"
bipolar,ep5bcty,t3_btxcdn,1559053254.0,"I'm also pregnant and I can't help to wonder how the pregnancy, delivery and post partum will be. I was very concerned that I might start rapid cycling, but I was told that there are proper ressources out there and it is possible to get help from certain organizations. I don't know where you're from but see with your health care provider what ressources are available for you. I was also told to try and get as much help as possible for when the baby comes so that you don't get triggered. Best of luck to you! üå∑üò∏"
bipolar,eoqoin1,t3_bsr99s,1558794846.0,"I can completely relate. I'm truly sorry thay you are going through all this. Being bipolar really sucks. You're always wondering if it' mania/hypomania that dictates your current moods. I don't know for you, but in my case my symptoms were not really clear. I've always been very emotional, but I lost all control and BECAME my ups and downs. I was hospitalised for a hypomania/mix state. It's now been 2 years since my diagnosis and I realize that things do get better. Proper medication and sleep routines can go a long way. When I'm depressed it lasts about a month but I tell myself that I can't fall again. So I clean my house, get my ass in the shower and try like hell not to stay in bed all day. It really does help, you can't control how you are feeling but you have a say in how it impacts your life. I truly wish I could say that we can cure bp, but somehow you just need to learn how to live with it. You seem like a fighter, keep up the good fight, you can do this!"
