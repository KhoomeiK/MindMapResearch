truechildfree,ffe9fpr,t3_eszzw7,1579840359.0,"So, I have had a tubal ligation, but I also had children before that so I don’t 100% fit your target audience. The recovery process should be pretty similar though so I thought I’d answer.

I had the clips done via laparoscopy. They put a large cone sort of thing in your vagina once you’re under, pump everything full of gas so it’s all easy to locate and manipulate, clip it all off, put in an IUD if you wanted to be VERY sure that you don’t get pregnant, and then stitch it all up.

I had one small cross shaped scar just on the public line, and one larger straight one in my belly button. I have a weirdly deep innie so that might have contributed to the size of the incision there.

In my experience the recovery should be done in a haze of endone if you can manage it, at least the first few days if not the first week. You really do need someone around to take care of you for a day or two, helping you get in and out of seats and bed, fetching meds, all that Jazz. They tell you not to lift much for the first few weeks and that’s for a very good reason. I picked up my chunky ass toddler once in the second week and regretted it deeply. 

If you haven’t given birth I’m told that the act of wrenching open the cervix can cause labour like cramps for a day or two afterwards, it varies from person to person though so you may not. Just thought I’d mention it in case you’re one of the people that have that issue and are confused as fuck when you feel like you’re having the worst period pains of your life.


Edit: I’ve just read a bunch of people saying they didn’t have much pain so I’m wondering if I’m the odd one out here. I did also have a terrible reaction to the Mirena I had put in at the same time so I’m wondering how much of my less than stellar recovery had to do with that."

For the most part, any racism spoken about in public is going to be pretty mild. The worst areas for education are also the most multicultural, so even your stupidest bogan is going to have had at least a handful of close relationships with people of different races and backgrounds.
