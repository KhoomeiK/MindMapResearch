science,f56ap00,t1_f566ufb,1572020802.0,"Oh I‚Äôm sure. I work with nurses like that. They are mostly the day shift nurses who aren‚Äôt there at 3am when mom is exhausted, baby is screaming incessantly of starvation and moms breasts are empty. It‚Äôs not a pretty site. You‚Äôll never get that shaming from me. 

Also, BFHI has created a ton of nurses who don‚Äôt know any better (young nurses/nurses with no kids) and have empowered the militant lactation consultants to further shove bf‚Äôing down your throat. Those of us who have been around a while and have our own kids and know what it‚Äôs like to live in reality, will never shame you. We will guide you and support you in whatever you choose to do, and when things start to go downhill, we‚Äôll be honest with you."
science,f55yqio,t1_f54g1jo,1572015865.0,"Labor and delivery nurse here - your story is so common. So many women have the same exact story and at the end of the day, your baby is starving and depriving him of food for the sake of breastfeeding is ridiculous and more importantly- it‚Äôs dangerous.

Never in the history of the world have we had so many guilt ridden mothers because of breast vs bottle. The internet has created this mom-shaming culture to unassuming pregnant women who don‚Äôt know any better.

I didn‚Äôt breastfeed any of my kids. Because I didn‚Äôt WANT TO. All three of my girls are happy, healthy, and successful in school. This arguing over molecules and 0.0000001% of whatever the hell makes this or that better for babies/humans is ridiculous. It‚Äôs not that deep. Feed your babies and keep it moving!"
Chriswatts,eugsvaa,t1_eugs55v,1563814247.0,"Ok, so I meant anyone who is offended, not specifically you. Why does OP have to talk about Chris‚Äô flaws at the same time? There are tons of posts about Chris‚Äô flaws. This specific post is about Shanann‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a discussion page. This post was about just that, and there are plenty other posts about other things related to the case. Also, what if a woman was being abused for years by her husband and one day she just snapped and killed him? Obviously she would end up in jail but could we not acknowledge the abuse she suffered for years at the hand of her husband for the sake of offended someone via ‚Äúvictim blaming‚Äù. In that case, the perpetrator was also a victim, for years. Things aren‚Äôt black and white. And in this case, there are a million variables. And THIS post was discussing one of them."
Chriswatts,eugqwos,t1_eugphhm,1563813200.0,"Well if we want to analyze the case, I guess one is left to make a choice whether they want to ignore the part Shanann played in her marriage for the sake of ‚Äúvictim blaming‚Äù or understand that we are absolutely not blaming her, nor condoning her murder, but that we are piecing together the events that led up to the murders and to exclude her actions, there would be no point in discussing the case. 

Also, for the sake of argument, one could say that for a long time, Chris was a victim of an emotionally abusive wife. There was little to no compromise in that marriage. We can see it in her videos and the things she says straight to the camera. 

For a mature conversation to be had about a very complicated relationship and subsequent murders. We need to leave out the emotions and lay out the facts. That‚Äôs a choice. You can stay in the conversation or leave it, if it offends you."
Chriswatts,eugoqke,t1_eugo22s,1563812037.0,I know. I‚Äôm tired of adding that disclaimer every single time someone notices something off-putting about Shannan‚Äôs personality or actions. No one deserves to be murdered...OBVIOUSLY!!!
Chriswatts,eugm7fo,t1_eughp7j,1563810632.0,"I think we are all in agreement that they didn‚Äôt deserve to be murdered, no matter where we fall on the spectrum of opinions of Shanann or Chris. But for people who are trying to wrap their heads around this case, of course we are going to analyze personalities of all parties involved. It‚Äôs merely an observation of her actions, not condoning her murder. That is a given."
Anxiety,et44wn2,t1_et42vg1,1562444165.0,Yup. Sigh.
migraine,erzyn03,t3_c53ao6,1561458657.0,So extremely accurate. Thank you.
zoloft,erzx0e5,t3_c4ug6c,1561456238.0,"Yes yes yes! I‚Äôm at the end of my second week starting Zoloft 50mg and I‚Äôm exhausted! My doc said any side effects would wear off after a month or so, so I‚Äôm looking forward to that. I‚Äôm starting to see a little breakthrough with my depression but constantly being exhausted and sleeping doesn‚Äôt feel great. Glad to see other people say it wore off after a month or so."
zoloft,erhsbt1,t1_erfovem,1560881822.0,"Do you mind elaborating on the first few weeks? How was it rough for you? I just started five days ago and I have noticed I‚Äôm tired a lot but when I sleep, I sleep so much better than I did before starting. It‚Äôs like a deep sleep, not waking up multiple times during the night but I‚Äôm definitely groggy the first few hours after waking up. This has been my only side effect so far, plus a little dry mouth."
zoloft,erhs0zv,t3_c1sm5t,1560881641.0,"Just started Zoloft 50mg five days ago too! I‚Äôm optimistic about it because in the past I‚Äôve been on Lexapro and more recently I was on Celexa. I felt that those would elevate my mood for the first few months and then quickly plateau and then I‚Äôd be right back where I started. Also, I like that there are multiple indications for prescribing Zoloft, as the Celexa is only for depression and Zoloft treats anxiety, PTSD, PMDS and OCD. Also with the Celexa I was only on it just under a year and I gained 20 lbs. I‚Äôve been off the celexa for a year now and haven‚Äôt lost any of the weight. I am concerned about putting on more weight since I never lost the weight from my previous SSRI. I guess we‚Äôll see. 

I‚Äôm really hoping this helps me. I haven‚Äôt been able to get out of bed unless I have to go to work. It‚Äôs literally all I do is work and lay in bed. Somethings got to give."

domesticviolence,eqamwh4,t3_bw5kuh,1559936020.0,"I do that too. On Youtube I watch Jenna and Julien, Hila and Ethan Klein...they are cute happy couples each in different stages of life, different family dynamics. But one thing I see as a constant between them all is respect and true love. They compliment each other. One is not dominant over the other. 

I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll ever have that and I don‚Äôt really care to be honest. I just want to have my peace and quiet back. My life. Me."
