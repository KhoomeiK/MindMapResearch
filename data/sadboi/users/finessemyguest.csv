I think *everyone* needs to be okay with themselves before being in a relationship for multiple reasons. When in a relationship, you cant look to your partner to make you happy --I learned this the hard way. You'll just end up being disappointwd and youll be putting unrealistic expectations on your partner. While also burdening them with extra strain and pressure to keep you heavy. On top of that, entering into a relationship with out being secure with yourself is a recipe for codependency. And maybe only one half of the pair codependent, that poses even more issues. 

As a female in western society, it's a challenge to be secure with yourself. In fact, most of my friends and family are incredibly insecure. I work with a bunch of really beautiful women and every single one of them is incredibly insecure. As in, they genuinely believe they arent attractive. The insecurity and not being confident in what you bring to the table in a relationship is the perfect storm for this type of relationship.

The only way I see something changing in the relationship and parenting is if you guys seeks some help. Either talk to their pediatrician as to what they recommend to get the kids to get some resources that are designed to help your GF and her children.

It has little to do with you or your looks. At least, this is what I figured out with my family.

I'm going to play devil's advocate here tho... I cant help but think there are things in his environment that pushed him in this direction? Do you think that hes in a low spot in life? Has something happened to him or his family recently? And lastly, has he voiced any concerns about not being able to open up to you about something? It's hard to imagine a rational human being that has everything good going for them just up and leave to go to a strip club and then confide in a stripper about deeply personal things.

Fellas, this is a prime example of why you need to set boundaries with your girlfriends/wifes early on. When you guys first start dating, shes going to pull stuff like this along the way to gauge your reaction. If you roll over and not saying anything, shes going to go to her mental check list and give it a little tick. Your wife is literally taking mental note of what she can get away with. I understand that most men want little confrontation. So you come to a bump in the road and you want to smooth it over so you dont end up in an argument with your GF/wife.  However, the more you want to ""pick your battles"" with her, the more she thinks shes getting away with ridiculous behavior. You gotta remember. Shes going to make it a bigger deal than it needs to be but you gotta stand your ground and not budge. Shell eventually learn where your line in the sand is.

Now, if you could rewind time, you wished you would have drew the line some where. So yes, I understand why you pick your battles but you are doing yourself a disservice by not setting up healthy boundaries. And by not setting up healthy boundaries, one day you wake up and get out of bed and start going about your day. 30 min later, your GF/wife is awake and grilling you because you got out of bed and now she cant sleep with out you in the bed.

However, if you have very good sexual chemistry and you drive each other crazy, that would be enough to propel the relationship far enough for a couple of years. But keep in mind, love isnt always enough and if you've been with someone long enough, you'll want --and need!--them to bring some beneficial life skills into the relationship because down the road, you don't want to be the only one contributing to the household finances.

With that being said, you guys are so incredibly young.  I feel like most people change so much from the age of 19-27. When you're 18, 19 or even 23 years old, you think you have life figured out and that you know exactly where you are and who you want to be.  But you learn so much about yourself in that time frame. Things that were extremely important to you in your early adulthood dissipate in importance by 25/26 and other things you wouldnt dream about doing or caring about become a priority.  

Moral of the story: you both are so young and you both are still working out who you are as individuals. But at the end of the day, it's very rare to be able to genuinely vibe with someone or find someone that you enjoy being around while also having incredible sexual energy.

Flat out, if your mom is not able to cover the cost for venue, food, or invites, than she has ZERO say in who and how many people are invited. I would stress to your mom that there are X amount of seats and X amount of plates of food. And those variables are already accounted for. Explain that you have squeezed every last drop of money out of your bank account and you flat out do not have any more money to cover the cost of food or invites for anyone outside of the 40 original guest list. Maybe even reiterate how this is YOUR wedding. You've already painstakingly gone over every detail of this wedding. Guest list, invites, florals, cake, food, etc and everything is lined up; there is absolutely no wiggle room in any aspect of the wedding. Hopefully she understands.

It sounds like your BF is relatively sheltered, sexually naive and/or hasnt had very much sexual education, and he probably doesnt have many sisters. I've found that guys who usually grow up with mostly brothers have a hard time understanding anything that has to do with women. Let alone girls grooming habits or normal female bodily functions like periods or tampons. (I'm guessing that since your birth control grossed him out, he wasnt used to seeing normal female... stuff in the bathroom at home.) So their only experience is dating women. You guys are pretty young so I bet I'm not too far off. Maybe just help him along the process a little bit. Itll probably entail a lot of hand holding and explaining things to him. Guys genuinely have zero clue what it's like to be a women or to date a women. Hes just not experienced yet, that comes with time. I'd also wager that you're his first serious adult relationship or at the most his second. It sounds like his experience is pretty minimal or he just had highschool type relationship."

Honestly guys, girls dont care if you cry or have emotions. We dont care if you care about taking your hygiene seriously. Like, moisturizing your face or getting a manicure or a pedicure.

You did the right thing by trying to cancel or reschedule the plans. 

Giving him the benefit of the doubt, maybe he had a bad day. Maybe he wasnt feeling that great and maybe there were things that happened at work that caused him to have a bad day. Who knows. However, that is no excuse for the way he acted. He grossly overreacted and did irreparable damage. 

I guess that since you're pregnant, it wouldnt hurt to hear him out. Depending on what he says, if you feel it's okay to stay, then stay. But I would warm him that if this ever happened again, you and the baby are out. While typing that out, I just remembered that you guys have only been married 2 weeks. Maybe he thinks that since you're married, you are stuck with him? This is so many red flags, it's made a huge stop sign.

relationship_advice,fhdoics,t3_f27mtr,1581493971.0,"From one mom who is affectionate and loving with my kids, I'll try to give you my perspective. 

It sounds like mom and daughter were super close. I'm guessing the intimate cuddling and touching started when her daughter was very young. She probably breast fed and would put her hand under her mothers shirt for comfort.  I've see this many times. Just look at the boobs, touching them, but only if they were breast fed. If there was any rational excuse, that would be my educated guess. I'm guessing that since that dad wasnt in the photo and it was only women in the household, these forms of serious bonding and affection never got phased out because there wasnt a romantic partner that was requiring intimate time away from the child. 

It just genuinely sounds like mom and daughter have been extremely codependent on each other and no one else has came into the picture to check it/end it before you came along. 

Overall, yes this is somewhat concerning behavior.  Do I think sexual things are going on? Maybe; I wouldnt be surprised.  Humans are extremely fucked up. But like I said above, I think it's those early infant/toddler and early childhood coping and comfort actions that never were ended. And it just carried through to where she is now. I think if your SO is serious about you, and if she wants her child to fly free from the nest, they're going to need to start limiting that behavior and deciding to limit it exponentially or else the daughter (and your wife/girlfriend) are not going to be able to form successful, not codependent relationships out of the household.

In fact, they are making plans and scheduling things and booking tickets without even running it by you. I think you should tell your husband to have fun in japan with his friends and that you will see him on the Greece trip. 

I'm a firm believer in: if you make plans to do something and you hit roadblock after roadblock after roadblock, maybe it's time to pull the plug.

The friend pushed him and the kid ended up falling backwards and cracking his head on the curb. It deeply effected the community. 

There was another kid in a neighboring town that drank enough wood alcohol that he died pretty much instantly. Probably not instantly but by the time they got to the hospital, it was far too late to save him. It was incredibly said. 


And I have one more! This happened a couple of years after I graduated. Theres a historic hotel in the middle of our city. It's a small one but it has around 8-10 stories, tops. A group of kids were climbing the fire escapes while incredibly drunk. (A side note, I guess it looked really cool up there? So it was a popular destination for a bunch of kids around my age. There was also some urban legend about the top floor/upper roof area.) The way the hotel was built, it was kind of asymmetrical. It was kind of L shaped in a sense of that the bottom two floors are longer and wider than the rest of the building and then the rest of floors are kind of stacked on top of each other like a tower the extends up in the middle of the bottom floors. He was in the top 2 or 3 floors when he fell off of the fire escape and landed on the roof of those bottoms two floors. He died instantly.
