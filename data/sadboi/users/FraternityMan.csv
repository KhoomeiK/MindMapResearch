Paint the background in layers, I stick to bottom shelf acrylics. Cut out tons of things and sort again. Then the fun part is positioning and taking photos of different arrangements. I pick my favorites and then put together the final look. I use a glue stick to carefully glue everything together. The last step is to seal it, but I haven’t done that yet.

Use a needle or toothpick to clean the top and bottom holes where the string is. Rinse well. Soak the plastic foliage in hot soapy water, and clean. 

If the pump works, all you need to do is add mineral oil and you should be good! Depending on the size of the lamp you will need a quart or more.

Their first experience with humans involved minimal handling and injections. It didn’t take too long for them to start trusting us (lots of treats) We taught them to come when called, they learned quick. 

Pet rats rarely bite, unless very scared. No they never bit us aggressively or from fear. They do love to groom us, and sometimes Hank cleans too hard haha. We just let out a squeak and he gets gentler."
