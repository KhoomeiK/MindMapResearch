mentalhealth,fqhmr94,t3_gizs3g,1589380160.0,"Hello,

First of all, thank you for sharing what you are going through and it is NOT selfish at all!  It takes a lot of strength to share how you are feeling and put yourself out there.  I want to start by saying while I am a firm believer that therapy doesn't completely fix everything and I want to acknowledge the feelings in a human way and not just in a clinical sense, but I think finding a good therapist and going back to therapy could be very helpful just to have someone to share these feelings with and get some advice.  That being said, even if you feel that these thoughts seem crazy or dramatic they are normal and I can totally understand where they come from.  I suffer with anxiety and depression too and sometimes find myself wondering why I am just ""pushing through"" when things could be so much better.  I'm not sure if you are a spiritual person (as I am), but another take I have on these thoughts is that your soul is trying to connect to something bigger.  The bottom line is you do deserve more in life- but to measure how good your life is based upon the physical things or what you are experiencing won't always be helpful.  I think finding a deeper connection to yourself and what makes you happy just as a being could help you discover things you could be doing for yourself or lifestyle changes or even just a new mindset to make your life feel more fulfilled.  Ask yourself this: what is it about your family that makes you so happy when you envision seeing them on the other side?  Is it that those were the last deep connections you've had with others?  Do you still have a step in the grieving process you need to go through?  What is it about spring that brings you peacefulness?  Is there an environment you need to visit more?  Is it telling you to slow down and bring more peace into your life?  What things in this life bring you those same feelings?  I think asking yourself those questions could help lead you to some beautiful realizations and positive changes in your life now.  I completely understand how you feel- nobody wants to just settle and push through what isn't serving them.  So I am not asking you to just ""hang"" on if you aren't satisfied with life now, I'm just asking to reflect within yourself and find ways to create a much better existence for yourself because you DESERVE it.

If you want some resources to connect more to yourself in a spiritual or just realization way, here are some:

I hope you know what you went through is ok and not shameful and has shaped you into the person you are today and the strength you now have!  I am still traveling through my journey as well."
