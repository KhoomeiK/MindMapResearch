Not to mention (and to ACTUALLY attempt to answer your question) the writting that set the president that not only is Drizz't not like any other Drow, but Breunor is closly the same as a dwarf, except his influence on his fellow clansman brough them into the same fold of respect Breunor has for Drizz't. That being the case, makes for a story of two forces in a opposing force world that makes for inherently good storytelling.

This can be from birth, or your changes start at age \[insert age here\]; you are born of tiefling parents, or human ones; and your family's scared past is known by them, unknown to them except maybe an elder, the secret of a whole village that hides your family cause they do good with their powers, or not. 

I think you should have more than enough bread crumbs to find your stories trail from this example, but teh best underlying thing I could say is, although they are rare, their backstory is as common as a species thats as common as Humans, because basically, teiflings are a subrace of humans and just another story of humanity gone wrong (as far as mingling with demons go. you can obvi be a nice heroic boi as you'd like)."

How it stands now? Well, there was the woman whom that had happened to at a CVS nought 2 or 3 months ago. That being said, yes its significantly less the case now. 

There is a well informed former Manager for Walmart whom commented here a bit that talks about them stocking it in the family-aid portion of the shelves as well. And for that I think the anti-theft stance has more credence. From there I argue that ir would be less targetted if it was so price gouged.
