I find that if you leave to tend to your mental health, she will take it personally and get hurt either way. I think the best thing to do in this situation is to tell her your reasoning so that at least she gets closure. She will be upset, but knowing the reasoning behind it helps. If you need to just take a break from her, tell her that you still care about her, but that you need some space. Make sure to tell her exactly what you plan on doing. If you plan on leaving for good, or just taking time to yourself. One of the worst things about bpd is that we overthink.

It seems like she doesn‚Äôt believe there is anything wrong with her behavior, or if she does that she is feeling invalidated in some way by you being affected by it. I recommend being blunt with her. Tell her that she is hurting your feelings and affecting your mental health, and give her the reasons why. These are your boundaries and she is crossing them. If she gets angry with you, it is because of her own insecurities. She is going to get defensive and say that you‚Äôre being unreasonable, but you have to remember that she has a disorder that affects how she handles her emotions."
mentalillness,fofv4af,t1_fofenz5,1587743357.0,"You have no requirement to stay just because you are somebody‚Äôs FP. But if you care a lot about her, I think the best thing to do would be to be there for her and tell her that you care about her, but also tell her your boundaries. She might take this personally and get angry at you, which she already is like you said. My guess is that she‚Äôs angry at you because she believes you don‚Äôt care about her as much as she cares about you and she feels wronged in some way, as if she deserves the attention and reassurance and recognition. A big thing with bpd is reassurance. We will get extremely irrational thoughts, believe that everybody hates us, that nobody loves us and that we are fools without any indication of that ever being true. A lot of the time that insecurity presents itself in the form of anger. It is a coping mechanism, and it is all we know. If you care about her, talk her down from her insecurities and irrational thoughts and feelings, let her know that you care. But also know that you have no responsibility to cater to her needs. You are your own person, and if you need to prioritize your mental health, you are not being selfish. Even if she makes you feel like you are selfish. People with bpd can be manipulative without even realizing it, and she might make you feel bad for wanting to focus on yourself. But you are completely justified. Of course not everybody with bpd is the same, this is just my two cents."
