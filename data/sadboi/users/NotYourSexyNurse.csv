You had to know the occupational hazards when you signed up.” We had PPE for those occupational hazards before. I lost it. I told him I didn’t sign up to go to the frontline of Ebola without a hazmat suit. Suddenly he understood. Covid-19 is not normal. It is not nursing as usual.

I will be adding tree guilds for 4 heirloom apple trees, peaches, apricots and a pear next spring. Most of the tress I wanted were sold out already this spring. With such a small space to grow I am very particular about what I grow perennial wise. I’m having to repair the soil and revert the lawn from grass to clover and wildflowers.
