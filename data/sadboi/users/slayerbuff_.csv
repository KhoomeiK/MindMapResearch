InvertPets,fp66lyz,t1_fp5u8bo,1588347015.0,"Thank you! Do you find that an overhead light doesn't dry the enclosure out? What do you suggest to place in there for climbing? Also, do you mist the tank and how often? /Do you keep a water dish or do they get moisture from their food? 

The only other beetles I've kept are desert beetles and I imagine the care is a little different."
mentalhealth,ffuglqm,t1_ffroovm,1580241521.0,"Agreed! I've improved my OCD and anxiety tremendously. My OCD used to be debilitating, and I've improved symptoms and my quality of life a lot with years of CBT, exposure therapy, etc. And part of the work now is accepting that this is a part of me rather than considering upticks in OCD/anxiety to be a personal failure, because that's an impossible and unfair standard to hold myself to.  It makes things a lot easier and gives me more room for compassion for myself personally. Like it is \*okay\* for me to be this way even though it makes some things harder.

(And that mindset doesn‚Äôt discourage me from continuing to work on things)"

socialanxiety,etejk1f,t3_cbblqd,1562734875.0,"Yes!! And when it goes away I get so frustrated knowing that I can do better, and I drive myself into a frenzy trying to figure out a way to get the feeling back. Which of course makes it worse."
