todayilearned,fqp840i,t1_fqp0h0x,1589538408.0,">If my history knowledge is correct, no. Reason why Nazis even came to power was because of penalties of Germany after WW1.

The Treaty of Versailles was certainly overly punitive on Germany. And it did help to create an environment ripe for Hitler to come to power. But the financial woes that Germany faced had much more to do with the global effects of the Great Depression. I'd agree that those conditions were greatly *exacerbated* by Versailles. But that doesn't make the Allies responsible.

>And when Germany started ignoring these penalties, allies(france, UK, USA etc) did litteraly nothing in hopes of war between Soviets and nazies(dunno if its accurate or not, to be fair). 

The US was largely determined to remain isolationist at this point. As for the French and British, their efforts to maintain ""*peace in our time*"" had much more to do with a reaction to their experiences in the last war. And not because of any desire to see Germany and the USSR fight.

You have to remember that the scale of casualties in WW1 was shocking to most European nations. Almost 6% of Britain's **total** population was either dead or wounded. For France, it was even worse, a staggering 15% dead or wounded. Faced with suffering and trauma on such a national scale, it shouldn't be surprising that they tried to avoid war.

>While soviets aside from spliting poland and non attack pact did nothing to help Germany. In fact they were major factor in defeating nazies

Pretty inexcusable to just dismiss the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Poland with a ""beside that"". If you're unconvinced about Soviet culpability, look up the 1940 Katyn massacre. But they did a **lot** more than that to help Germany.

Germany had important trade agreements with the USSR that gave them access to strategic resources like oils and precious metals that were essential to the Nazi war machine. The Soviets also built a number of training facilities in the USSR **for** Germany in 1929. They were specifically created to train tank crews and fighter pilots in secrecy to circumvent the Versailles restrictions.

Now, the USSR did *eventually* come to be one of the determining factors in defeating Nazi Germany. But that doesn't change what happened before that point."

Long story short, all of thedonald was whatabouting Trump's statement on Clinton: “*If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people...maybe there is, I don’t know.*” 

They tried to say was that she was guilty of a similar faux pas. I was banned when I pointed out that she had actually apologized, and that Trump was unlikely to.

It's a shithole."

Was he being sarcastic? Of course, he doesn't consider you a friend. But your reaction? It'd be like someone saying ""How ya doin mate"" and being worried they're hitting on you because 'mate' *also* means ""spouse or lover"". In the context it's unlikely to the extreme, the same is true of 'chum'."

The old [Battle Hawk](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/3/33/3055_Battle_Hawk.jpg?timestamp=20110719181829) was just a smaller, just as ugly clone until Plog drew a [better](http://cfw.sarna.net/wiki/images/b/b5/3055u_Battle_Hawk.jpg?timestamp=20110118202502) version.

battletech,er45g95,t3_c08l8w,1560481546.0,"While I'm interested in the new sets and how they'll look, the fact that they're going to Kickstarter is...troubling.

I was able to get both of the recent box sets through my LGS, but the  window in which they were able to order it was *very* small. There was one more stretch a few month later where the Beginner Box was briefly available. And that's been it, they can't order any more. Maybe there's more available online, but that's not a good way to grow a community.

There are no guarantees that it'll be easier for any LGS to gain access to new Battletech product this time around. And with Kickstarter, they have the problem of deciding whether to stock it at all. A lot of potential customers will have bought *their* copy on Kickstarter. It's great for Catalyst in the short-term, but may cause problems beyond that."
