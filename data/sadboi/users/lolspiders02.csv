mentalhealth,fqvl41v,t3_gham3a,1589679583.0,I feel the same way about having no friends and never have dated. I was also planning in getting a job soon cause it was my senior year of highschool and I'm not going to college... cause I didnt have enough credits to be a senior at the time of applications. I still dont and I dont think I'm going to graduate... which makes me want to kill myself. I just wall all this bull shot to be over with or I think I might actually do it. I always wanted to but knew I'd never do it but now I'm not sure... I'm too chicken so I probably wont.

4) make earning money more reasonable
5) Let me guys some good guns in the beginning soni can defend myself better from the people who have been trying to kill me.
6) just make it more fun. When I play the story mode there is so much more to do when your not even doing the story. Add more fun things to do like that. Find cool things when exploring or something. Idk.

I was excited to play online and make my character very dishonorable because i made Arthur and john very honorable and to start I was going to rob some stores and I was very disappointed that I couldnt even pull a gun out in them."
