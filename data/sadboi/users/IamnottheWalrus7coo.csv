DebateEvolution,ev24mid,t1_ev1r717,1564170393.0,"It is the theological position held by the Orthodox Church. The Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church, Demetrios, published work through Holy Cross Press on the subject. 

It is the only answer that is theogically sound, considering the development of sacred scripture. It is in direct opposition to the view of literal  interpretation of scripture.

And it kicks ass!"
DebateEvolution,ev05mgt,t3_chzpmp,1564132272.0,"Theistic Evolution.

The belief in the science of evolution with the understanding that there is a God who is the source of all life. The biblical accounts are not interpreted as literal but as a way in which the author understood and communicated their existence with the world around them."

AskReddit,es8l1eq,t3_c6cq6r,1561701975.0,"Weathly East Coast relatives were traveling to the West coast to spend Thanksgiving with wealthy family members , not related to us. 

I was serving in the military and stationed in Colorado. Weathly relative heard I was going to be spending Thanksgiviing with a couple buddies, away from family.

My relative heard about this and landed there G5 in Denver, myself and my buddies boarded the plane from a private terminal. The plane pulled up, door opened, we got in, spent the afternoon at a beach house near LA and were back in Denver that night.

You can be spoiled rotten. You can also work for it, be spoiled and not be a self serving jerk."

Love x3. I'll try but I'm an ass x3.
Which brings me to my request:
If there is a heaven or some type of afterlife which there is an 'up or down' decision by God, the Big man (or woman) or Great Kahuna in the sky; could you give a little nudge and put in a good word. I need all the help I can get. 
I'm an ass. 
Thank you"

In Flanders fields the poppies  blow
    Between the crosses, row on row,
  That mark our place; and in the sky
  The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.

We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
  Loved and were loved, and now we lie
      In Flanders fields.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
  The torch; be yours to hold it high.
  If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
      In Flanders fields.

  -Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae. 

The poem references the red poppies that grew over the graves of fallen soldiers resulting in the 'remembrance poppy' becoming one of the world's most recognized memorial symbols for soldiers who have died in conflict"
