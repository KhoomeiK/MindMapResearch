AskWomen,fqh95m7,t3_gil16z,1589371544.0,"Very recently. Got hired for a conveyancing (law firm) job, and within the first day got scolded 'cause I was supposed to bring a blazer to meet clients when I had no inkling I would be seeing clients on day 1 (previously I was only allowed to see clients after at least a few days/1 week). 

The promised ""extensive training"" was just ""have this stack of forms to read"", and they only let myself and the other junior (let's call her Annie) sit in on 2.5 client appointments before testing us on the client spiel (at my previous conveyancing position I spent three weeks sitting in on multiple appointments a day before they even considered letting me go solo). The test was essentially a ""you need to be word perfect with what we cover, as well as knowing exactly how to answer difficult questions"" (that we never heard asked in said appointments!). The requirements were not communicated to us prior to said test, either. We did poorly, and the Boss chewed us both out publicly with the inclusion of a lot of personal attacks on both of us. 

That was when Annie checked with a lawyer friend who worked with the government labor department about a term in both our contracts regarding time off, which said friend confirmed was straight up illegal. 

There were two incidents which caused us both to leave at the same time-- the first being, the boss came into our shared office yelling at Annie about a document she'd supposedly signed off on that had errors in it. Fair enough, but that wasn't even remotely close to Annie's signature (big and complex vs small and simple). It wasn't even Annie's *pen* (she used light blue ballpoint, this was dark blue ink). Then the boss said something about ""oh the secretaries will put errors in their documents to test you"", which made no sense. In a busy law firm, why would the support staff waste their time to do that when the document would have to be revised and fixed again later? 

The second incident, on the day we both quit-- Boss asked us to help fill up some paperwork for one of her pet secretaries (""Betty""), but it was a form and format that we'd never done before, so we asked one of the friendly secretaries (""Candice"") some questions about it. She was happy to help, so we finished the forms and handed it back to Betty. Afterwards Candice came to us and said that Betty had demanded to know why she had helped us, and said that Candice wasn't supposed to help. Which, to both of us, sounded like we were being set up to fail. 

The tipping point was when I expressed my frustrations to the recruiter who'd gotten me the job, and she called me back the next morning saying ""if you're going to bail, do it now before you get locked in, I've got your back"", and also that she'd heard some disturbing stories about a previous junior lawyer at the firm who'd been forced to take responsibility for a mistake they had nothing to do with and had to pay several thousand dollars in damages. 

Which is when I decided enough was enough (three anxiety attacks in ten days of working for this boss) and Annie and I served our resignation letters together. They tried to refuse the resignations, which is illegal, but we managed to ram the resignation through and walked out that afternoon. Felt so good."

DnDGreentext,foaxms0,t3_g6ij3q,1587653814.0,"I had Spell Sniper on my Celestial Warlock, she was gonna be one of those ridiculous sniper builds (along with Repelling Blast to act as battlefield control). We had one encounter where my girl was talking to a kobold in the bushes-- the kobold was trying to sneak up on our camp and steal something but had been spotted and decided to try to talk to me instead. 

Me: DM, can I see the kobold? 

DM: Sorta? He's got half-cover at least from the bushes. 

Me: No he doesn't. Spell sniper. 

DM: .... shit, I forgot you had that. 

Sadly that campaign died, but I still wish I'd been able to level her up to full strength/skill. With some additional levels in Sorcerer, she would have turned into walking artillery."
