TalkTherapy,fm2056v,t1_fm1rlm7,1585688183.0,"I disagree. Sometimes, venting is healthy. It’s not like OP is calling her names to her face. Life’s a bitch, none of this is fair, so why should OP be? Feelings are feelings, and if OP is angry at their therapist, as long as they don’t directly say or do hurtful things, then they deserve to vent their anger and pain however is best for them. They can reflect on the bigger picture later, when some of the pain wears off. I called her a bitch to validate OP’s feelings in contrast to everyone telling them not to feel that way, not because I feel that OP’s therapist deserves to be called one. Sometimes you just need to vent and call someone a bitch in a way that’s safe, like anonymously on the internet. It’s better than taking that anger out on the people around you, or the person themselves, especially if you know they may not necessarily deserve to brunt that pain. OP has already stated they don’t want people to try and change their opinion, so I’m leaning into it. Sometimes you just have to call someone a bitch to get it out of your system."
TalkTherapy,fm1lfth,t1_flzwi8o,1585680562.0,">>Seems the takeaway is that I’m supposed to be more upset than my therapist, and to just live with it, but it’s unempathetic to point that out.

Yup. Therapists are a bit hypocritical in this respect. I guess they take any attack of their profession personally, because it’s their profession and there’s that sense of community. They believe that they’re people capable of being imperfect and making mistakes, but they also believe that the consequences of said mistakes (having to deal with unhappy people who they’ve hurt) is not something they should have to deal with due to boundaries, and that everyone should always forgive them because they’re such good people because of their job title alone. And on the one hand I get it, because everyone makes mistakes, but on the other hand it’s really hard because if this was anyone else in our lives, it would be totally reasonable for us to confront them for hurting us and it would be on them to deal with the consequences of their actions. But in therapy, we’re the crazy ones and they’re the perfect, reasonable mediators, so it’s on us to take our pain and take it somewhere else, where they don’t have to deal with it because it’s not theirs to deal with. It sucks. But that’s the way it is. You’re gonna have to chalk this professional up to being a bitch who abandoned you, wrestle with the confusing feelings of liking her and hating her all at once, and then move on. For what it’s worth, I don’t think it’s un-empathetic to have these feelings. I think it’s very healthy to focus on how you’re feeling. You can have empathy for her later. Right now, focus on feeling your hurt, because she hurt you. No one would tell you to “have empathy” if it were your parent who suddenly left you with no warning and without saying goodbye. They would understand that something bad has happened to you, and now is not the time to tell you to see things from their perspective. Now is the time to feel hurt, angry, and sad that this happened to you. I’m sorry things had to go like this. Most likely, it was out of her control, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t hurt or that you have to like her for it. All that means is that it had nothing to do with you. It’s not your fault this happened, and I’m sorry you’re stuck dealing with it. Therapists often forget that they are still very capable of doing bad things, and that they don’t automatically deserve forgiveness for it just because they intend to help people. Sometimes they damage us. It’s ok to hate them for it. It’s not your job to care about them or be empathetic to their mistakes. So keep your distance, because violating your therapist’s boundaries will only make things worse for you. But recognize how unfair this all is, because it is. There’s a natural power imbalance in therapy, and you’re currently experiencing the shitty side of that."

BPD,flu4w1v,t3_fcrfpo,1585495277.0,"Hi, I know I’m really late here and I don’t even have BPD, just ended up here by accident on a Reddit-rabbit-hole. But this post really resonated with me so I just wanted to share my two cents. I have CPTSD with some borderline and psychotic tendencies, and I tend to gaslight myself in this way by always assuming that I’m just triggered and completely over exaggerating or literally hallucinating/making things up entirely. 

But my therapist told me, there’s always a trigger. And he’s right. Yes, sometimes we have a tendency to overreact to those triggers, like if it’s just one little mistake someone who’s otherwise really good makes one time, that doesn’t mean we need to hate them and cut them out of our lives forever. But... it was still a mistake. They *did* make a mistake. It happened. And while our reactions might sometimes be too intense for the situation, **something happened**. You didn’t make it up. You’re not crazy for reacting to it, you’re not seeing things that aren’t there. 

We don’t get to choose the intensity of our emotions. Obviously it’s our responsibility to learn how to handle our own emotions and make sure we don’t take them out on others. I’m not saying it’s ok to blow up at a good friend or hate them forever because they made one mistake. But I think people need to understand that an emotional reaction, even when it’s an overreaction, is still a **reaction**. Whatever you’re feeling, it’s always a reaction to something. And it is so unfair to tell someone that they’re crazy for having that reaction, that it’s just because of their diagnosis. A BPD diagnosis means your reactions to things that happen can be more intense than some people’s. It does **not** mean that you’re making things up those things that happen. Something happened. Something always happened. Sometimes it’s small, sometimes it isn’t. Either way, it’s always valid, because every reaction is a **reaction**. And as long as you aren’t using your emotions to hurt people, then you absolutely, unequivocally, always have the right to react to things exactly as you do. If it’s a strong reaction, maybe we need time to cool off before we can take stock of the situation and decide if we’re actually reacting in a way we would want to. But no reaction ever makes the situation less valid. Your perspective can change, but the facts stay the same. If you’re reacting to it, that means something happened, and that’s always valid.

Something happened."

TalkTherapy,flk3uaj,t1_fljo1tt,1585233350.0,"Unfortunately, that is something you’re gonna have to figure out for yourself. I can’t tell you what your own gender identity is, let alone how to express it. I would recommend finding an LGBTQ-allied therapist to help you make sense of all this and figure out what your next steps are.

Make sure your therapist is LGBTQ **allied**. It should say on their website, especially if you search for “LGBTQ allied therapist”. But when you first start talking to them, be careful. If they say they are going to help “cure” you of this or that “god forgives you for your sins” or anything else indicating that they are going to try to **change** who you are rather than **accept** you for it... run. And don’t look back. Depending on where you’re from, it can be difficult to find a counsellor properly trained in LGBT issues, especially the T. If you can’t find a therapist who specializes in **helping you be who you are** in your area, I’m sure there are plenty of online options. DO NOT settle for an in-person counsellor who does not accept who you are. Conversion therapists are wrong and they are very, very dangerous. If a counsellor ever tries to make you feel bad about them, that is a huge red flag. Be cautious. Please protect yourself.

Unfortunately, the world is a scary place, and it’s full of scared, ignorant people. I’ve faced enough rejection from therapists to know how much it hurts, but again, remember that is says a lot more about them than it does about you. No matter what, keep trying. Help is out there, and for every person whose heart is full of hate, there is another whose heart is full of love that they are just waiting to give to you. You are a whole person the way you are right now, and you deserve love, care, and acceptance. In time, you find a good therapist and true friends, and they will give you these things. But for right now, try to give them to yourself. 

Love yourself and accept yourself for who you are, and remind yourself that this hate and shame you carry isn’t yours- it’s your family’s, society’s, and everyone else who is so weak that instead of dealing with their pain, they have tried to project their pain onto you so that someone else could have it. However someone tries to make you feel, that’s how *they* feel inside. That’s kind of sad for them, isn’t it? But their shame is not yours to carry. You have nothing to be ashamed of or to hate yourself for. There is nothing wrong with you. You’re a good person. I truly hope that someday you will be able to see that, and be who you are without fear or shame.

Good luck 💛"

It’s your therapy- your choice. Everything you do in therapy is the right thing to do. The real question is, is going into these topics without being able to ground yourself making *you* worry or feel powerless? That is a better reason to slow down a bit, rather than basing it on your T’s hypothetical feelings. But if you feel ready and able to deal with this discomfort, then that’s all that matters. It’s your therapist’s job to hold space for you no matter what. She will deal with her own personal feelings about your treatment and it shouldn’t get in the way at all.

And it’s a bit of a mindfuck to realize that the whole world isn’t used to shit like this. Not everyone has adjusted to the feeling of constant danger. For me, anyways, that’s a lot to think about.

Same, but that’s why I’m loving teletherapy, lol. It’s sooo much easier when I don’t have to look at them/be near them. The disconnect helps me relax because I don’t have to worry about the intimacy level getting too overwhelming. 

>>I don't want to hear my therapist voice over a phone, I feel like her voice would be too close, I guess.

I get the exact opposite vibes as you here. Her voice feels so much more distant over the phone to me, plus it’s kinda warped from the speakers. It puts such a comfortable distance there for me. Plus, if she starts to feel too close, I can always physically move the phone away from my face (or even put her on speakerphone and then set the phone down somewhere) or lower the volume.

>>I don't want to be in the camera. I actually don't even like facetiming family or anything like that.

SAME. Absolutely, same. If I couldn’t do phone, just video, I would probably just stop therapy altogether.

>>⁠I do not want to see my therapist's home or personal space. Nor do I want her to see mine.

Same feeling here, see my last point.

>>⁠I think we both will be able to tell less about how the others feeling since we won't have as much body language cues.

In some ways I agree. I really like having the lack of body language cues, it gives me an added layer of security. Plus, I find when I’m being watched that closely I tend to go into the “freeze” response and curl up into a tiny ball and it’s uncomfortable and unproductive. Over the phone, when she can’t see me, I can relax my body a little more than I can irl. Plus, without having the option of watching her, my hyper vigilance has less to work with and it’s much easier for me to focus and not get overwhelmed.

That being said, you might be surprised at how much you can pick up on even without seeing her, or her seeing you. I found that working over the phone made us both more expressive through our voices. It’s kinda like how blind people have their other senses heightened. True, you can’t see each other. But rather than just missing a big chunk of information, your brain is pretty good at making up for it by becoming more sensitive to everything else. It’s almost easier for me now to analyze how my T is feeling, because there’s less to focus on, so I can focus on what is there more.

Anyways, thanks for sharing your perspective! It’s so interesting how everyone reacts so differently to the same situations and information. People are fascinating! But on a real-er note, I hope you and your T figure out a way to make this situation work for you :/ good luck!"

TalkTherapy,flb7nuf,t3_fmzr10,1584999048.0,"RED FLAG.

First of all, it’s your therapy. That means YOU are the one in control of when it starts and when it ends. She can suggest that maybe you have more things to work on, but if she isn’t saying precisely what those things are, just vaguely telling you to keep coming back, that’s a massive red flag. They are not supposed to make you dependent. They are supposed to work themselves out of a job, so to speak. Convincing you to stay on the basis of “if you don’t want this that means there’s something wrong with you and you need to stay and figure it out” is, I think, manipulative and unfair. You know yourself best, always. If you don’t think you need therapy anymore, then you don’t. 

Ignore the people who are telling you that you’re avoiding something. Yes, sometimes people think they don’t need therapy anymore because they are actually avoiding something that might be good to work on. But therapy only works when you want it to. Staying because you think you should is unproductive. Maybe someday you will change your mind and decide that you were in fact avoiding something, but now you find it interfering with your life and so you would like to work on it. That’s ok. But going to therapy to avoid the possibility that you are avoiding something that you may someday need to work on is stupid. That might not even be what’s happening at all, and you could waste so much time and money trying to figure out what you’re “avoiding” when the truth is that you’re not avoiding anything. Even if that is what’s happening, forcing yourself to stay if you are in a place where you are not ready to confront it yet could be overwhelming and damaging, and could even actively make you worse or retraumatize you. 

If you are satisfied with your current progress, then the therapy is done. It doesn’t have to be done forever. But it certainly doesn’t have to continue right now, or ever. If your therapist tried to convince you otherwise, that is a huge red flag and highly unethical. The choice to continue therapy or not is ALWAYS up to you.

Second, it is highly unethical to keep you if you cannot afford it. If you want to stay, they can offer sliding scale or try to help you afford it, but they CANNOT treat you if it interferes with your finances. ESPECIALLY if you are SPECIFICALLY SAYING that’s one of the reasons you want to leave. Jesus Christ, that is so irresponsible on her part.

And I clicked away IMMEDIATELY as soon as I realized. But I still feel like a disgusting stalker for having seen it. Blech. Luckily, I’ve only googled each of my therapists a couple times, and most of them have pretty clean online presences. But I’ve found some weird shit a couple times. It’s like opening Pandora’s box."

Yeah, not everyone is affected by statistics, there can be a “that won’t happen to ME” mindset that takes over in some people so that they aren’t overwhelmed by fear. Telling them to be afraid won’t help, as then they would actually have to feel the fear that they are avoiding. So playing to YOUR emotions and making it something they can do for *you* to ease *your* anxiety can appeal to their egos and let them feel like a hero while taking care of themselves, instead of being afraid. Sometimes you just gotta parent your parents, lol!"

TalkTherapy,flb2xhc,t3_fnnh6c,1584996293.0,"It seems like you want someone to make you to tell her, but the fact is that you don’t have to, so no one is gonna make you. Therapy is what you want it to be, and you work on the things that you want to work on. If we “had” to tell our therapists anything, it wouldn’t even be effective, because for therapy to work you have to want to change. If you want to change the way you feel about your therapist or you’re worried that it’s unhealthy, then bring it up. But if you’re ok with being this way, and you’d rather not share, then don’t. You never have to do anything. It’s your therapy. Your choice. It can be hard to bring things up sometimes, but that is something you will have to acknowledge as an insecurity and choose to challenge if you want to talk about it."

If your housemate forgets to do the dishes, you might tell them: “That’s ok, just please try not to forget again. I really value keeping the house clean.” 

You *might* tell them: “You fucking useless piece of shit. You should be ashamed of yourself, you disgusting pig!” or: “Whatever, it’s only dishes. Who cares? Let’s live in filth and NEVER DO DISHES AGAIN! VIVA LA RESISTANCE! EAT OFF THE FLOOR!”

...But probably not, lol.

Do you see the difference?

Try treating yourself the way you would treat a housemate or anyone else you have to live with. After all, you have to live with yourself, too. So do your best to follow the “house rules”, but if you slip up, that’s ok. Just do your best so you can keep the place clean and conflict-free for everyone."

I can’t imagine essentially watching my parents kill themselves. I would be honest with them about how hard it is for you to have to watch them put themselves at risk, how terrified and helpless you feel, and how cruel it is that they aren’t even trying to stay safe for you, their child, who needs them. Then reinforce that with the statistics and beg them to try to stay safe, for you. If they still don’t, I would start planning their funerals, and asking them for their input on what kind of flowers they want and making sure their wills are up to date. Ask them if they’d rather have a virtual funeral or wait until the crisis is over so their loved ones can attend. Don’t do it in a snarky way, genuinely try to plan for the funeral they would want. It will also make it easier to plan it now then when you’re actively grieving. Just because they won’t take this seriously, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. But hopefully the morbidity of it all will slap some sense into them. Idk man. Good luck, stay safe."

TalkTherapy,fl7ll03,t1_fl6ucik,1584904269.0,">>There is a chance she will not truly hear what you are telling her, that she will hear and respond to a filtered version of what you are saying. Or that she will not respond at all.

Yeah, I know that it will hurt me if she simply doesn’t respond at all, or doesn’t want to talk to me. But I also know that I haven’t done anything bad enough to warrant that kind of response, so it’s not on me if she does. Plus, like I said, I can always revenge-report 😂

At the end of the day, if I do this I will be vulnerable to her once again, which means she can hurt me once again. But I also recognize that that’s a hurt I can deal with, because I already have. So it doesn’t feel like anything she could say or do can hurt me *that* badly. Even if she says something good, I don’t think that will have much effect on me either. I no longer need anything specific from her.  I just need to reach out one more time, knowing that it’s for the last time, so I can finally feel like it’s properly over and close this chapter of my life. Basically, I think I just need to reset my nervous system. (My new therapist said this once when she wanted us to do an activity to help me move on from something else that had happened.) My brain knows it’s over, now I just need my body to know it, too.

TalkTherapy,fl5r8h9,t1_fl57olp,1584843658.0,"I left a more detailed reply on u/halfsteppup’s comment, but basically I don’t think the closure will actually come from what she says or how she responds. I think it’s more just my need to say it, and tell her that she hurt me and that I want answers for it. If she doesn’t give them or tries to put the blame all on me or otherwise doesn’t give me what I want, then I’ll know that she’s toxic and can safely assume that she is the problem. But if she does give me what I want, then it can potentially be a very healing experience that will help me move on from things. I know that closure isn’t necessary for healing, because I’ve never gotten it before in any of my experiences. Closure is important to me here specifically *because* I’ve never gotten it. I want to be able to lay at least one of my experiences to rest, or at least say that I tried my absolute best to bury the hatchet instead of avoiding the awkward conversation forever and leaving it hanging over my head."
TalkTherapy,fl5qot5,t1_fl59e9i,1584843268.0,"The thing is, I’m not actually sure it does depend on her response. I’ve just never gotten the chance to tell someone they hurt me and have them understand that what they did was wrong and that it *hurt* me. My parents and family are a lost cause, most of my rapists are strangers who I have no way of tracking down (and for the few who I am still friends with on Facebook, I don’t really think it will end well if I hit them up after all this time to accuse them of assaulting me), and all my shitty teachers/doctors/psychologists who failed me as a child are lost to time as well. My old therapist is the only person who has ever hurt me that I have actually a chance at getting closure with, because it’s (physically) safe enough to contact her, she supposedly has the training to navigate this type of thing, and if anything goes wrong I can always just report her (I even have proof from when my two friends saw us getting coffee together). There is so much hurt and uncertainty I have to live with and just accept as is, but with her I might not have to, and I’ve never even had that possibility before. I’m not sure if the closure will come from what she says, because I honestly don’t know what I want her to say, or if it will just be from the fact that I got to say it and have her acknowledge it in the first place. Does that make sense? I don’t know if what I’m saying makes sense, lol. I’ve just never ever EVER gotten to even tell someone when they did something wrong without severe repercussions. (Even her, she quit the first time I told her I didn’t feel safe.) I just want to try so that I know with certainty what will happen when I do it. I know that if I leave feeling worse or still having no idea how to feel that it means she’s toxic or trying to manipulate me, since healthy people try to come to a resolution that feels good for all parties. So if she doesn’t give me what I want, I’ll still have an answer, and I can say with certainty that she’s not acting right. And if she does give me what answer I want, I don’t think it will matter if I can fully accept it or not. Because at least I’ll know that it is possible for someone to care enough about my pain ~~that they caused~~ to try and make it better, even if it is just so I’ll go away again. That being said, I hear you, and I should definitely follow up with my current therapist before I reach out to my old one. (If I even do it at all.)

>>I’m all set with continuing this conversation further.

I can’t tell if this means you want to continue this or you don’t. If you meant you actually don’t want to continue this, then please just ignore the rest of this comment. But if it does, I would love to continue, because I still don’t understand your perspective.

Can you respond to my argument about clean endings and explain why you still think this is a good idea? I kept my points general because I don’t like bringing people’s specific situations up in arguments, and because I don’t actually know anything about you, just what is best for people in general as dictated by the therapeutic boundaries. If you can present an argument for why check-ins post termination are healthy/good for long term growth that actually focuses on the argument of what makes it a good idea rather than making it about me and my personal issues, I would be interested to hear it. Because from where I’m standing, right now it feels like all of your counter-arguments have been solely based in using my feelings to write my points off, rather than actually explaining how this is good for you. 

Yes, I get that you miss him and want to see him. But I think your therapist is being irresponsible by giving in to those feelings, rather than doing what is best for you and letting you learn how to deal with those feelings on your own, with your new therapist. I’m not saying that it’s not ok to miss your old therapist, I’m just saying that it seems unhealthy to continue to go to back to someone who you decided to stop seeing, for any reason. If this was truly just a catch-up because you really do care about each other, wouldn’t it make more sense to wait the minimum two years? If there were no attachment issues involved, this would feel like a long but manageable time. But if you want to see him so badly before then that you can’t wait the appropriate amount of time (according to the professional boundaries), even after you terminated, and even though you don’t actually need his help as a therapist anymore because you already have a therapist, doesn’t that mean there’s an issue? And feeding into issues is not a healthy thing to do.

It seems like your therapist genuinely cares about you, and that’s ok. But it seems to me like he is feeding into your feelings of wanting to see him again, because he also wants to see you again. And that is a dangerous, slippery slope. Because how will you feel if one day he no longer wants to do the check-ins anymore, or he no longer has the time because he has too many clients? Maybe you will feel fine with it. But maybe you won’t, and you’ll feel abandoned or no longer in control, and that is not ok. (On his part.) I’m of the opinion that therapy should never be about the therapist’s feelings, ever. Even if it feels good. Because feelings change, and that’s not productive for a client to have to deal with while they are trying to heal. I truly believe it would be in your best interest to learn to move on now, while you have a clean break and proper closure and good feelings all around. I think check-ins and bending the boundaries just makes things messy, and risks ruining this relationship that you put so much time and effort into. If that uncertainty is something you’re ok with, and think you can handle if it ends badly, then all the power to you. But if these check-ins have the potential to hurt you, then you need to be aware of that so you can make an informed decision on what you should do.

If check-ins are part of your transition to your new therapist in a way that helps you deal with the attachment issues that leaving brings up, then that’s a different story. But they still need to have a set end, and in that case, it would mean that you haven’t actually had your final termination session yet. If this is the only check-in you’ll be having and you think just one will be enough to satisfy the feeling of missing him forever, then that’s ok, too. But if these are just something you plan on doing indefinitely, just because you miss him, that does not sound healthy to me, and I would be interested to understand why I’m wrong."
TalkTherapy,fkmanxx,t1_fkkx284,1584324536.0,"This was never meant to be a personal attack. You know I’m not some malicious troll, you even said in your original reply that you knew this was me just trying to be kind. I did not mean to imply that you’re not grown up, or that you don’t have good social connections, or whatever else you took personally from my response. I truly am sorry if I’ve come across as bashing you personally in any way, shape or form. That’s really not what I meant to do.

All I’m saying is, maybe there’s a reason why no one else in the comments had heard of someone doing this before, and why no one else has left a comment about having a similar experience. You are not supposed to go back to your old therapist once you’ve left, unless you need to see them again for treatment. They are not supposed to be in your life forever. The not knowing what happens to you is part of what they signed up for when they decided to be a therapist. And as sad as it can be for you to longer have that person to update on the ins and outs of your life, by the time you’re finished therapy you’re supposed to have a strong enough support system that you don’t need to update your therapist anymore, because you have other people to tell who can satisfy that need for intimacy. 

Of course it’s normal and ok to miss people you care about, that’s what I’ve been trying to say, too, but you said that was just me projecting. But just because a feeling is right to have, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s right to act on.

I think this sub tends to glamorize the “attached” stage of attachment issues. The reality is, not everyone experiences these intense emotions regarding their therapists. That doesn’t mean it’s abnormal if you are this way; many people do and it’s totally ok if this is something you deal with. But plenty of people just show up to therapy, say what they need to say, and leave, and that’s the end of it. Those are people with secure attachment. Secure attachment is the goal, if you don’t have it when you come in. And part of being secure means that, when it’s time to move on from someone, you do. People with secure attachment can miss someone, accept that, and move on without needing to follow up with that person. People with secure attachment know that while it is ok to need people, if someone isn’t there, that’s ok too, because at the end of the day they only need themselves, and they will be able to find new people to rely on without ever needing one specific person that they live in fear of not having anymore.

If that sounds like you, great. If doing this is something that works for you, awesome. But I know what can happen when therapists blur the boundaries and let themselves fill the role that was never filled in your life, instead of teaching you how to fill it yourself and through your relationships in the real world. Because therapy has to end eventually, one way or another. He cannot be in your life forever, that’s just not healthy. And if you’re going back every couple of weeks even after you’ve supposedly terminated, then it’s not really over. So, when is it going to be? Will this check-in be the closure that you need, to be ok with that? Or are you planning to have another check-in after that, and another one after that, and another? You can go back for as many check-ins as you want, but someday one of them will be the last. Will it really hurt less by then, or are these check-ins just delaying the inevitable?

I am not saying any of this is a reflection of you at all. I am not trying to call you unhealthy by saying that this is. You are much further along in the therapy process than I am, and older and wiser, and overall probably much healthier than I am. Maybe I am projecting. But I just don’t think this is a good idea. The boundaries exist for a reason, and I think your therapist is doing you a disservice by not letting you have a clean break. The way I am understanding these check-ins, it sounds like they will give you the illusion of a permanence that isn’t really there. At the last check-in, won’t it hurt more to suddenly have that illusion shattered, and then have to move on by yourself after you thought you already had, instead of with the closure of a good, proper termination session? 

I think if something is over, then it’s time to move on. I think anything else will just hurt you more in the long run. But again, I really was just trying to help. I did not mean to start an argument or hurt your feelings. That’s the reason I have a disclaimer in my initial comment. I obviously don’t know your relationship with your therapist the way you do. 

I have absolutely no investment in what you do with your life and your therapy. If you feel that check-ins are what’s best for you, then go ahead. I told you to do whatever you want from the beginning. I just also know that a lot of what I felt was best for me actually wasn’t. I thought my old therapist was what was best for me, too, at the time I was still seeing her. So when I saw this post (which I did admittedly misinterpret as looking for advice, when that turned out to not be what you were looking for) I thought I would leave my two cents in case it was helpful. I’ve been saved plenty of times by people on this sub, you included, giving me advice that I needed to hear even when it was hard to come to terms with. But if this not what you needed to hear, then I really am sorry. I never meant to cause problems. I was trying to be empathetic, but it is possible that was actually projection. I will have to think about that more, because that is not something I meant to do, or want to do going forward. 

This was never meant to be anything more than my opinion, which is that this is unhealthy. But my opinion is also shaped by my experiences, and I couldn’t tell you how much of that is caused by emotion clouding my judgement. You will have to decide for yourself how much of my opinion is valid, and how much to write off as my own shit. And then, like I’ve been saying, do whatever you want. At the end of the day, it makes no difference to me. I was just trying to help."
TalkTherapy,fkj6zjp,t1_fkhxmly,1584237835.0,"I don’t know. Judging by the lack of responses to this post, this doesn’t seem like a very common thing to do. Just because something feels good to you right now, that doesn’t mean it is typical, common, or healthy. I had things go very sour with a therapist due to boundary violations that felt really good at first, but ended up fucking me up for a long time. I know what can happen when you mess with the professional boundaries of the therapeutic relationship, and I know just how devastating the effects can be. Mine felt great until it didn’t. I obviously don’t apply this rigidity to real-life relationships, and I believe that everyone deserves to feel connected to someone and be cared for and listened to. But the goal of therapy is not in and of itself to connect to someone. Learning to connect with someone can be a goal, but the therapeutic relationship is not a goal in and of itself. It’s there to serve a purpose, and once that purpose has been filled, it’s time to move on.

I am also an introspective person, and I am not saying that self-reflection is bad. I’ve spent the past year in therapy and have completely transformed as a person, and I still have a long way to go. But once I have met my goals, and am able to live a fulfilled and productive life without trauma or maladaptive coping skills getting in the way of thing, it will be time for me to leave. Obviously, we all grow and change throughout our entire lives, and there will always be something to work on to better yourself. But the point is to be able to navigate life’s ups and downs on your own, with a support network made up of real people who you can have genuine, two-way relationships with. Being able to self-reflect on your own when something isn’t working to solve problems as they come up is an important life skill. Therapy is there for whenever you hit a wall and need an outside, objective opinion to help figure out why you’re stuck. But if you’re just going for the sake of it, because you like the feeling of it, that’s introspection you can do on your own, or with a trusted person in your life. It is counterproductive to live your life in a safe space. Life is hard for everyone.  If you are no longer actively healing from trauma and maladaptive coping skills, then continuing to see a therapist and endlessly introspecting without a purpose is the equivalent of having an overprotective helicopter parent. It’s unhealthy, and can hold you back from experiencing life in the raw. Safety bubbles protect you from the lowest lows of life, but they also block out the highest highs. You deserve to be living your own life for the sake of it, not as a means to do more self-work. Reflection is a tool to use in order to live your best life. But it is not living in and of itself, and you can’t apply the things you learn in therapy and test drive your new coping skills to live a more mindful and present life if you’re always in therapy, self-reflecting endlessly without purpose. That doesn’t mean you can never go back once it’s over. Rough times happen and you may need to return to therapy in the future. That just means that you should either be in therapy, or out of it. Not going back every couple weeks just to feel connected to someone in an artificial way. That energy should be put into fostering real relationships. Therapy is simply a tool to help you do that more effectively.

What you’re describing with your therapist sounds unethical. She should not be in casual contact with you for minimum two years post termination. And to be frank, you should not be in therapy for 7 years with the same person, either. If you’ve been going every week for that long without any breaks and still need to be in therapy, then clearly something isn’t working with what you’re doing, and that is a signal to change therapists or try something different."
TalkTherapy,fkh8bbu,t1_fkg78tn,1584191934.0,"Hey, I’ve actually thought about it more and I really don’t think my comment was about personal transference. I apologized for it yesterday because I truly didn’t mean to hurt your feelings, and thought if I did that must mean I was wrong and you were right. But I still have weird feelings about this whole thread, and it would be a dishonest representation to myself not to share them the same way I shared all of my other thoughts.

I don’t think it’s healthy to still need to go back and see your therapist after you ended things. I don’t think it’s healthy to think of your therapy as a “real” relationship- it’s a therapeutic one, and there’s a very real difference between the two. It’s not supposed to be the most important relationship in your life long-term. It’s just supposed to model one so you can learn what that feels like and how to develop one in the real world. But going to therapy is not a goal in and of itself. It’s supposed to end. All of my new, healthier therapists have said that, and that it would be unethical to keep me there super long term. And they’re right for thinking that. It’s not healthy to spend your life self-reflecting on it instead of really living it. The reason there are so many transference posts on this sub is because that’s the only reason a therapist should be on your mind that much. When things are going well, you’re hardly thinking about them at all, because you’re not too attached and are busy living your life. If it makes you that angry to even hear my opinion, then I think you need to think about why, because anger is a secondary emotion. It’s usually protecting fear or shame or hurt. (From what I know about anger, anyways.) It can be really hard to say goodbye to someone who has meant so much to you for so long. But I think it’s important and healthy for both of you to actually say goodbye, and move on. Otherwise you’ll always have that small child part of you that feels like you need him, instead of only needing yourself. And that’s just unfair to you in the long run, because that part is afraid of being alone and unloved and incapable. You deserve to truly know that you aren’t any of those things, and you can’t for as long as you’re still dependent on someone. I don’t know, maybe this is just transference or projection or whatever on my part. And you’ve always been welcome to ignore my opinion and go back to him if you’re sure you know that that’s what’s best. But therapy isn’t meant to be forever or be one of the most important relationships in your life long-term. You’re supposed to grow up and not need him anymore and then leave, even if it’s sad for both of you. Sorry if I hurt your feelings again, but I have to honour my own thoughts too, and I didn’t yesterday. It’s just something to think about for the next stage of growth for you. It’s scary, but that doesn’t mean it’s wrong. I’m not claiming to know better than you or anyone, but I’m not claiming to know worse, either. This is a public message board and I’m allowed to express different opinions than the one you wanted to hear."
TalkTherapy,fkge3wl,t1_fkgdaw0,1584157019.0,"Yeah, I responded to them with an apology

Edit: deleted my apology because it wasn’t authentic to my feelings, but rather a reaction to OP’s reply. Left a new comment, but I’m not sure it counts as an apology so I wanted to update this comment too."
TalkTherapy,fkg7cby,t1_fkg6bfd,1584151779.0,"No problem! Out of all the experiences I’ve had, losing my therapist during an overwhelming time for me was the one that broke me. I totally lost my personality and kindness for months because it all just hurt too much, and I was completely consumed by the pain. My heart goes out to you. It feels so, so horrible. If I can give a little more advice, I would encourage you to reach out to a new therapist for help as soon as you feel ready. You’re not un-help-able, you’re not stuck being alone forever, and you are definitely worth it. The therapist I met after mine abandoned me was the best one I ever had. It still hurt so much, and didn’t stop for months, even after I got new support. But don’t mistake these feelings for the truth, or for forever. They are intense but they will not kill you. Fuck that stupid bitch for leaving you. Fuck her for making you question your worth. Fuck her for making you feel like no one cares. (I’m just guessing, these were my feelings.) Get better in spite. Get better out of spite, lol. Just know that you can still get better. Things are not as hopeless as they often feel. Again, I really am sorry for what you’re going through. Sorry for the rant. I just really empathize and want to help you, even though I’m not exactly sure how."
TalkTherapy,fkfo757,t3_fi7oeb,1584138813.0,"Everyone told me not to and said if I wanted to do that, I should bring it up with my new T. So... maybe do that first? Run it by your new T to figure out *why* you want to go back to your old one. A lot of the comments I got was that it means you have underlying issues related to the old T that you need to process through, and that it’s not good to do that *with* your old T. There’s a reason you left your old T. We can’t relive the past forever and cling on to something that doesn’t exist anymore. You just have to grieve the good parts and learn from the bad. I mean, I don’t actually know that much about your T, so do it if you want to. But as someone who’s struggled with addiction, I know how much harder it is to quit whatever it is you’re trying to move on from when you don’t actually quit. There’s a reason alcoholics can’t just have one drink. It’s really hard to lose an intimate relationship with someone, especially when you have attachment issues. It makes perfect sense that you miss him and want to go back and see him again. But my advice is don’t. It will only hurt more when you have to start over not seeing him again. Be gentle with yourself, acknowledge your feelings and accept that you miss him and that this is hard. Be grateful for all the good things he gave you. Then remind yourself why you left, that it wasn’t working, that it’s time to move on, and commit.

(That being said, I actually have no idea why you left. So do whatever you want? But from the outside, wanting to go back to an old T that you just recently left sounds unhealthy, and will probably only hurt you in the long run. Especially since you already got closure, and had a last appointment. Why would you reopen things unnecessarily? That’s just not helpful. Don’t let yourself fall back into old patterns. It only makes things harder.)"

TalkTherapy,fkf64lo,t1_fkesfjr,1584127817.0,">> I’m at a turning point where i need to find strength solely from myself, and I’m scared I don’t have it.

I felt exactly the same way when my therapist quit on me. She was the only support I had during an extremely hard time, when I was really suffering. And then just like that she was gone, and I found myself completely alone. (Literally. I ended up having a psychotic breakdown and spent about a month raving to myself in the woods like a proper crazy person. That’s the state I was in when she left.) For me, the scariest part was the uncertainty; the not knowing. Not knowing what happened, or what was happening. Not knowing if I would ever have support like that again, and if I did, if they would leave me, too. Not knowing how I was going to make it through this, especially without anyone helping me.

I am not saying it’s easy. I am not saying it doesn’t hurt. It hurts like a fucking bitch. And I am not saying I know how things will turn out for you, that this is fine and everything will definitely be ok. I had plenty of setbacks, times when I felt like it would never be ok, and I had good reason to feel that way. 

All I’m saying is, you will surprise yourself. The not knowing is the worst feeling, but it’s also your blessing in disguise. You have no idea what you’re capable of. And I’m willing to bet that it’s a lot more than you might think right now."
TalkTherapy,fkeyym7,t1_fkeyi3v,1584123620.0,"That’s a confusing mess of emotions to deal with, for sure. Different parts of you will be feeling all sorts of different things. That doesn’t make any of your current or past feelings or choices any less valid, though."
TalkTherapy,fkey352,t1_fkevu1b,1584123100.0,"I don’t know what the things are that people usually say, because I am (thank god) still slightly too young for people around me to be making babies on purpose. And I know you specifically said not to say them, so I’m really sorry if I’m overstepping. But, reading that whole sentence made my heart hurt. A lot. I don’t know what the right words to say are. I just wanted to tell you how much just that sentence alone affected me. I can’t imagine how much it hurts for you. I’m so, so sorry. Seriously."
TalkTherapy,fkexkcd,t3_ffn4gg,1584122782.0,"Yesterday I had myself in a FRENZY about CBT and was feeling all kinds of things towards therapy and my T. But then someone commented on my post I made about it that to some people it feels invalidating and that’s why it doesn’t work for them. And something just clicked (probably because that comment was very validating, lol) and I realized that was my issue with it. Feeling invalidated *triggers* me. That’s what was happening! And triggers are something I know how to deal with. Now that I know that’s what happening, I can just remember to validate myself in my head. And once I calmed down and separated this situation right now from other situations I’ve been in during the past, I realized that if I add in that missing validation part, her advice was actually really good. Now I feel a *lot* better. Like, really significantly calmer. I felt tension I didn’t even know I had leave my body. I mean, I don’t know. Maybe it’s just cuz I’m high. Lmfao. But it feels like progress? I just hope it sticks once the weed wears off!

Update: the weed has mostly worn off and I still feel more at peace :) ...for now, at least. My username is not for nothing! I get triggered at the drop of a fucking hat."
TalkTherapy,fkcoukg,t1_fkc4plv,1584057762.0,"I haven’t actually seen any posts about CBT on this sub 😅 did I just miss them somehow? But I learned a LOT about attachment theory, lol. 

Anyways, thank you. I guess that’s good advice. I just have a mental resistance to doing DBT because of that therapist I saw who suggested it, and because I have a deep-seated fear that I’m borderline even though I got a full psychological assessment and multiple people and professionals have said I’m not. There’s nothing wrong with being borderline, it just ties into some of my personal traumas, and so I’m having trouble getting past that, so I don’t want to do DBT. Plus it doesn’t help that I’d probably have to use that shit therapist’s referral, which in my head would make her right about everything and she was a fucking bitch so I don’t want her to be right. Lol. But that’s something to think about, so thank you."

It’s a channel run by a dissociative system that’s super educational and very supportive to all kinds of mental illnesses, but especially DID (obviously).

It makes it more comforting to know people are always being real, even when it’s irk-y. It means they’re also being real when it’s not.

And same to you! Thanks for the support :)"
TalkTherapy,fjgnj8y,t1_fjgmewh,1583331347.0,"Aww, that sucks. I’m glad you’re back, though! I don’t know why your posts would get downvoted, you never struck me as particularly toxic. Although what do I know about that, lmao. Yeah, taking a break from this subreddit was good for me. I found myself ruminating about therapy way too much and needed to reset to life in the real world outside of therapy. And also I found myself basing how good of a person I am on how people on here responded to me, since therapy is about getting better. But this isn’t therapy, it’s just a subreddit. I probably still won’t come on here too often, idk. I still feel like there are some people who hate me or at least don’t like me as much as they used to and the rejection stings, even if it’s imagined (I can’t tell if it is or not, lol). Plus it’s not good for me to ruminate too much about therapy when I have stuff to do in the real world. Can’t use this to distract me from living forever, lol. But idk. My new therapist is messing with my head and challenging my views, so it will be nice to have a place to process some of that if I need it."

TalkTherapy,fjem094,t3_fc4kf5,1583274092.0,"Hi guys. I used to post here a lot, but then I stopped because I felt like everyone hates me and just wanted me to go away already, so I did. 

Anyways, I didn’t quit therapy today even though I really thought I would. So I decided, might as well do one more thing that’s hard and post here again even though it gives me serious social anxiety. 

I’m definitely still struggling a lot with the damage my old therapist did. She changed me for the worse and got me stuck in a really toxic place. But I don’t want to be the kind of person who can’t move on from things, or who lets any one person have power over me. I have to keep trying. So, I’m just gonna see how this goes before I make assumptions."
