unpopularopinion,foon8zz,t3_g8hdc7,1587942383.0,"I love my mother deeply, and I no longer hold any of this against her but she raised my brother and me while having untreated BPD, which was most likely due to the abuse she suffered when she was a child and teen. She never spoke to a therapist or took medication until I was over 18. My brother committed suicide when he was 21 and I was diagnosed with BPD at 23. I would be lying if I said she didn‚Äôt play some part in it. I know genetics probably played a part, but I know that being raised by someone who was either ‚Äúgood mommy‚Äù or ‚Äúbad mommy‚Äù was distressing for us."
