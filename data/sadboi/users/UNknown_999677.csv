weed,fo3guwm,t1_fo3g8hn,1587486679.0,I love CBD but it can get really expensive
weed,fo3f1v4,t3_g5i4pq,1587485800.0,Yes it helps alot but what you have to keep in mind is the dosage. People often have a an ok experience with CBD because they don't take enough. I usually take 4 times the recommended dose on the tincture. Tinctures are more effective than most methods. If I were you I would buy a high potency CBD oil tincture and try different doses. See what works for you.

I bet that kid hasn't even thought about me since. This world is cold. This girl I dated 3 months ago for 2 week lied to me 4 times and was talking to other guys. That was the last person I was close with. She's gone now. How could someone do that to somebody. I never dropped so low. It was like withdrawal or a come down from a drug. That high brought me so low and I was left there.

There are over 500 chemicals in the cannabis plant and there are all types of combinations to create strains. To use to catigories indica and sativa is a diservice to the users. I've had sativas knock me out and indicas get me motivated. But to answer your original question I would say that the sativa high is associated with euphoria, energetic, motivated, laughter, ECT."

Anyway it went away about 2 months ago. Good sleep helps soooooo much. When your tired it usually makes it worse. Ive heard that any drug even caffeine could potentially make your symptoms worse. Meditation also helped with my depersonalization I don't know if a little acid would help but again, I don't know. Drink water, get a good amount of sleep and try meditation."

lonely,flecvq2,t1_flcz07y,1585081946.0,Drugs and alcohol won't fix your marriage. Tell her that you want to reconcile with her and make things better and do what ever it takes. If she says she loves you she probably means it. I've seen situations where it looks like the marriage can't be saved but you have more than a chance. Go talk to her and ask her what she wants and vice versa. I hope the best for you.

CrazyIdeas,fkf7e9t,t3_fi4xnn,1584128527.0,I do believe that it escaped or was released from a lab and there is already some proof that it did. This idea is a little out there. we won't  ever go into martial law or at least the us because the people will resist. Corona is projected to stay for approximately 6 months. I think that there was a reason as to why they released it if they did.
weed,fkf6r0g,t3_fi4y59,1584128171.0,Maybe you should buy more weed when you make trips up to the dispensary. Maybe there are some plugs by you.

Marijuana,fk9d9ok,t1_fk9bxi4,1583973704.0,"Thanks. The research is very conflicting. I have found studies from I think Web MD that day that marijuana use although still bad not as bad as everyone thinks. And than I find research that says that marijuana is horrible. I am not your typical user. When I smoke I meditate, make music, read, and workout. In the research it is almost 99 percent of the time studying frequent or heavy users. In the research I don't fit into any of the categories such as heavy or frequent user. I don't anyone personally my age that uses marijuana like I do."

I still do thank you for you comment
Marijuana,fk9c1pl,t1_fk98cn8,1583972994.0,"Thank you for your advice. When I smoke I usually smoke from anywhere to a half gram to a full one. I am not a frequent user. I dont smoke because of my friends and I don't do I because I'm bored. When I get high I'll sometimes read, workout, make music, meditate or do other things. I think of being high as a break from stress. I don't use to avoid my problems it's just a little break. I am alot of the times productive when I'm high. I probably smoke like 4 to 5 times a month. I have not noticed my quality of life diminishing. Last year for ONLY ONE WEEK I smoke like 3 or 4 times. With frequent use I do notice a dulling effect but it goes away. I never did that again and don't plan on it because I know how weed effects me. If I notice an my quality of life being effected by weed I will stop. I in no way shape or form have any kind of addiction to weed. Again, thank you for your advice."
