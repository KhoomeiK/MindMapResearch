CoronavirusAB,fpvwubr,t3_fhkvpm,1588953261.0,"I say yes. I am still working and have been making mortgage payments, but there have been other expenses that I wasn’t counting on. My parents live with me and while I pay most of the bills they still take care of most of the groceries, house insurance, and cable/internet. But because of how things are going down and some health problems, neither of my parents can work and are not eligible for relief payments.  So now I’ve had to buy groceries for three people. And make sure while we are not hoarding we have enough staples in case something does happen.  And with medicine being filled only once a month, there’s lots more dispensing fees. And I had to buy masks, etc. I guess I’m saying that even though I have a job, my family required help to survive and now my credit card has quite the debt on it."
