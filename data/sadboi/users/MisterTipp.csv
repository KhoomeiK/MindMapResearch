Traditionally we are told that the history of Jews is one of constant persecution and finally the holocaust. But what I found is that yes, there is a lot of persecution, but it's also about adaptation. Jews weren't just victims, but another group in society. They learned from the rest of society, and the rest of society learned from them. And the holocaust is just one part... Some of the biggest Jewish emancipation movements and haskalah philosophers came from Germany.

I am interested in getting the Tecsun PL-660, but I've read quite a few reviews about it breaking down easily. Have you had any experience with it? Is there anything in that same price range that offers good quality?

And yeah, the 909X looks amazing, but it's pretty expensive for someone who hasn't gotten a clue about this stuff. I think around 100 euros, maybe 90-110 is a good price range for me. Is the PL-660 the one I should go for?
