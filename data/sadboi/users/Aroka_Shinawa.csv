mentalhealth,esh917l,t3_c7qkc0,1561986501.0,"Thank you for being honest with us. That's an indication that your head is kinda ready to get the real help.
In my opinion, this does not sound weird at all. But i think that not something evil wants to punish you. It's more likely your brain after all.
You had a really traumatic experience back then and it still sticks.
Please tell the team like you told us. Tell them why you lied to them. What happened and is happening and most importantly atm that you took drugs. They're having the equipment to see if it's something chemical in your brain and how to work with you to get better.

You shouldn't experience this. You deserve safety.
Sending you lots of love"
