introvert,f9m9a7x,t3_e5qcha,1575447127.0,"I am not looking for a relationship but I do feel hopeless in this world where I feel isolated. Hm, I think you should undergo psychotherapy. My social anxiety is not as high as it used to and I am not diagnosed with it but I have very low self-esteem and my brain screams things that make me isolate myself. So yuh, talk to a counselor and get assignments every week from him/her. :))"
