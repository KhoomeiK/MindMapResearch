I know things are shuttered due to coronavirus but wanted to suggest maybe some individual or couples counseling?

I hesitate to give too much advice b/c I do not know you or him.

That being said, a statement like he made is almost an ultimatum. It may be time to take stock of your relationship and decide if it's worth fighting for or not. Cos the bipolar is not going away. Also sometimes when spouses say things like that they may have made up their mind already and want ""out.""

I know it may seem scary, but sometimes shedding an old (toxic?) relationship is what's called for b/c either you or he have changed enough that it just doesn't work.

Sending you as much love and mental fortitude as I can muster...."

They are making good progress on the new building, it is being demoed during the quarantine. I am curious if they will just be more overpriced apts regular New Haveners can't afford a la Corsair et al."
