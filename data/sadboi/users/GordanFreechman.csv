I knew all about the healings and sightings at Medjugorje and Fatima, the weeping statues, Lourdes, the Shroud of Turin, uncorrupted saints, the bleeding hosts, Padre Pio and the stigmata, you name it. When I was younger it all seemed very real to me. To question anything about it was not even an option; after all, people who doubted these miracles were daring to doubt the work of God and that was absolutely a sin. 

When my little brother was dying of terminal cancer, we somehow got a hold of a relic of Padre Pio through our parish priest. It was a tiny piece of cloth with a pinhead size drop of blood on it. My family laid this on my brother, desperate for some sort of healing miracle.  That never happened, he passed away a few days later. I held a lot of hope and faith in these relics up until that point. It really messed with me that something so supposedly sacred, precious and powerful did literally nothing."

If I'm making plastic look more like metal, I actually like to use multiple layers of glossy metallic spray paint, like Rustoleum. They have a glossy chrome that looks really nice. It gives you the option to knock down the finish at the end as well depending on the clear coat you use.

I love prop food too, and drinks! I think one of my favorite productions I ever worked on props wise is a show called The Wier. It's set in an Irish pub and the characters tell ghost/folklore stories, some of which are disturbing or sad. I loved working on the props and set dressing, we built a fully functional bar on stage. You could pull ""Guinness"" (Diet IBC Root Beer) or Harp Lager (non-alcoholic O'Douls) from the appropriate taps. It was set in the round, it was a gorgeously detailed set.

I used PVC pipe, then sleeved a smaller length of pipe inside for the can to stand on, and sleeved over that with the cardboard tube to help mask it a little more.
