Pets,fov1xp8,t3_g9n1is,1588094062.0,"Honestly, all great advice has been posted but I would add that a lot of this comes with just going with the flow with how the cat is. My cat adjusted really quickly, she was a bit scared of us at the beginning and hid under the bed for an hour or so and then was very social. My friends' cat was way more shy, wanted to stay in their small bedroom all day and wasn't ready to socialize for at least a week. It really depends on the cat. 

I personally would start with the bedroom, it smells like you so it'll familiarize your cat as this person is okay. If the cat seems freaked out by loud noises, just close the bedroom door and let them be. If they seem like brave lil ones, then let them roam the apt. As far as a litter box, we have ours in our bedroom away from the head of the bed and I haven't had any issues with it. I know people don't like that, but my other option is either in the kitchen or living room and I'd rather not have it in spaces I spend a lot of time hanging out or eating. 

Baths, I only give my cat a bath once a year or if she steps in her own poop. Which is not often. I use dander wipes (I like the burts bees ones) to keep her clean and brush her teeth, but I try not to give her a bath too often or she gets a lot of dandruff. 

Vets, I took my cat to the vet within the week I got her, just to make sure she didn't have anything from the shelter (the shelter mentioned she might have been exposed to ringworm, so we just took precautions). But we also just wanted to make sure she got a rabies vaccine and up to date records. 

I wouldn't worry too much. I stressed a lot when I first got my cat, but I think the thing that helped me is that I'm doing everything I can to make my cat's life better than what it was (aka living in a shelter after getting hit by a car). As long as you are doing YOUR best to provide them with the best care, that's all that matters."
socialanxiety,fmjbasw,t3_fvkj2u,1586126812.0,"I'm 25 and feel the same way. I don't know if that's comforting or terrifying, but you hit a point where you have another realization that everyone is stuck and no one knows what they're doing. 

Just know that people only tell you and show you as much as they want to. They won't tell you any of the bad parts cause who wants to hear about that? 

It's your own pace that matters. If you look at your life and you are happy with where you are right now despite your age and despite everyone else's lives, then you are exactly where you should be."

Pets,flp58nc,t3_fpwzoc,1585351922.0,"I recently moved across the country with my 4 year old cat. It was a 2 day drive ~ 18 hours total of driving. All we did was spray some pheromone spray and kept her in her carrier. Every 3 hours of so, we'd let her out to use the bathroom, but for the most part she was calm and would peak her head out of the carrier to say hi. 

Was she happy? No, but she adjusted to the hotel room and the new place really well afterwards and I think a lot of it is trying to keep calm and keep them safely in their carrier. 

We made sure there were 

- TONS of liquid treats available (she doesn't bite treats if she's scared/stressed)

- a litter box in the car I could easily uncover and let her go

- lined the bottom of her carrier with puppy pads just in case but she had no accidents"

The thing that I've accepted is that people will always see our ethnicity first. No matter what, they've already started putting us in a box. What matters and what can change how we feel when people make those comments is how we reply. Like when someone says ""Don't nobody"" and you point out that it doesn't make sense and they say ""fob struggles"" just say ""no not a fob struggle, just incorrect grammar."" 

It's always okay to have an accent. It's okay to speak English or Chinese or whatever language with an accent. People don't realize that languages are barriers, but if you put in the effort to communicate, it's a beautiful thing. Think about all the conversations in the world that you don't know about because of a language barrier. 

You are you and that's perfectly fine. Also, in terms of identify being Australian and Chinese, you might enjoy watching this Youtube duo called TwoSet Violin. They're a pair of Australian violinists, but they're a funny pair."
