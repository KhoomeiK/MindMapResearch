Also you have to be really basic in knowledge itself to actually compare Sanders (and strangely not Warren simultanously) to early communists."

And with Biden - no one believes in him, he is blend, he is plain, there's nothing to him.
Yet you choose to be blind to those facts."

mentalhealth,fhk93j4,t3_f3nz6n,1581672840.0,"Yep, all the time. I feel like a burden for everyone for constantly being in a hard mood, for not being able to keep myself positive. 

It's nicely phrased - this note about feeling as being too self-absorbed - for what I know, what I've been researching on the matter of depression it is a common feeling so I guess it should be ignored. 

On my personal thoughts about it - it would be hard to think if my neighbor's doors are closed when my own home is on fire, wouldn't it?

Just try not to put too much load on yourself."

Things that demands action from me, for which I will not receive happy-molecules because of my depression. At least that's how I understand it. Therefore it's not normal, it's an issue that begs to be adressed which I am going to do and I recommend you the same, my dude."
mentalhealth,fbtk4qg,t3_eef2lx,1577081932.0,"Aw man, you're the first I've came across to admit something so close to home. It's just like 'yeah I want to do it but the life itself is so heavy that I cannot muster myself to proactively execute the action'. And it's not like I don't like you or I don't care - I just don't feel anything at all. Simply put - anything, neither positive nor negative - just hollow.
I feel you, we must have some sort of a defense mechanism maybe, some kind of self-implemented reaction to everything that happens because for most of our (Don't want to be guessing for you, now I'm self describing to better emphasize) lives it was harsh and the brain decided that feeling bad is not good for the whole organism so it cuts off emotions, all of them. At least it's mine interpretation.
If you're able seek help, go to the specialist, it' s always (cannot stress enough), ALWAYS, worth."

According to my best knowledge (which is not so great be wary) hibernate should meet all of your requirements but for more complex queries you should take a step down in this abstraction staircase and use more robust JDBC solution.

Wanting to talk to anyone and, at the same time, now wanting to overflood your relatives with your shit and fearing that you won't be understood which will only deepen your sadness and loneliness. But it's only your depression-filtered assumption about people telling you that is how things gonna turn out. Talk to your parents, to any friend, it's worth it."

Any mean of exposure, showing that I am not alone, that this is something that just happens, I'm not going all nuts and that there IS hope and one CAN recover and is NOT doomed to live the rest of they life this miserably would be a great relief.
