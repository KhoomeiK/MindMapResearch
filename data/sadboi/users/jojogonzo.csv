WhitePeopleTwitter,fob6d8f,t1_fob5dme,1587656602.0,Scientifically speaking human beings are animals. That's not up for debate. Science can also be tested and repeated and is a much better basis for morality than any myth or religion.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fob0gcl,t1_foay8ex,1587654695.0,"See, but owning slaves takes away the freedom of another living human. Abortion does no such thing. Life doesn't start at conception. There is no scientific evidence to even make the claim somewhat feasible. Even the bible says life begins with the first breath and also is fine with abortion. So again, you have chosen to interpret your chosen religion in such a way that makes you think abortion is bad, that's on you.

Ironic that you bring up slavery though, since NOWHERE in the bible it mentions slavery as being wrong. So I guess you're fine with slavery and abortion then? 

Or maybe, just maybe you should base your morality on reality. Realizing that a woman has agency over her body and can choose whether or not to carry a fetus to term. Also realizing that owning other humans is one of the worst things a human can do to another, despite the bible being fine with it."
