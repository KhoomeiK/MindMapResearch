mentalillness,fr033mh,t1_fr007h1,1589782314.0,"I was referring to the general public stigma. And I didn’t even think about the paraphilic conditions, hyper sexuality is a symptom of my bipolar (almost never happens) but I can’t imagine what it must be like to live and cope with that all day. And I thought it was intresting how you brought up how a mental illness occurs.  Dispositive identity disorder and ptsd come from traumatic events and situation that are often almost taboo to talk about. (Sexual abuse snd harassment, child abuse, traumatic situation from war, etc)"
mentalillness,fqzzntz,t1_fqzz91f,1589779545.0,"I agree with you, schizophrenia has way more of a stigma compared to anxiety and depression. There is also the fact that anxiety and depression are romanticized in our culture today. A lot of people suffer from some form of anxiety and depression but now it’s a thing that makes a person “edgy” or “cool.” While a lot of people are edgy or cool, mental illness shouldn’t be the reason that you are viewed like that."
mentalillness,fqznlqk,t3_glmyo2,1589771183.0,"In all honestly there are AMI (any mental illness) and SMI (serious mental illness.) everyone on this sub suffers from a mental illness in their own way, there’s really no use on comparing who has the hardest life. But in my opinion (I’m purely talking about the stigma) some mental illnesses are stigmatized more than others. Usually the more frequent mental illnesses have less stigma because many people suffer from it and everyone knows someone who suffers from it."

By his logic he is saying that everyone has highs and lows, which is true. Everyone on earth experiences happiness and sadness. But when your bipolar those highs and lows become way more extreme to the point where it makes it hard to function. That is what people don’t get, it’s extreme mood swings and the abnormal highs and lows. If you haven’t struggled and felt those feeling and seeing the way those episodes effect other people (everyone’s mental health journey is valued and valid, I am just referring to some common ones) then you don’t get to sit there with your entitled ass and say that my emotions, struggled and mental health are invalid.

Once I wrote study sheets for school until my hands got blisters and I didn’t sleep and ended up coming down half way through the test. Sometimes I also get obsessive about little things like trying to find a small thing like finding a charger for a watch I haven’t used in mounted, frantically flipping through photo books to find a picture that sometimes doesent exists or driving to the store at 11:30 at night looking for something stupid like a flavor of jelly bean or some kind of cookies.
