Colorado,fr38zbl,t1_fr38kb7,1589852372.0,Thank you
Colorado,fr36mam,t3_gmcomj,1589850995.0,Beautiful! Where was this taken?
Colorado,fq6lpxg,t1_fq4ju76,1589133948.0,I get scared too. Its definitely not just you :)
Christianity,flvm0mo,t1_flvirnl,1585526783.0,You know :) you should go read Roman's chapter 13. Have a good day
Christianity,flvdt0g,t1_flodrno,1585521712.0,"Ok? We are not all the same nor do we all have the same views. I never hated on Obama either. I waited and cast my vote and what happened, I had to be ok with it."
nosleep,flozx8z,t1_flowt9v,1585348882.0,That sounds about right from people I've talked to in the past. I'm always just glad I'm not crazy lol I never answer though lol that's just asking for trouble.
Christianity,flny55s,t1_flnwkn4,1585328090.0,"You know repent means to change your mind. He was telling the religious at that time that the law wasn't going to save them. At any rate sin is sin. You still sin, I still sin lol we live in a fallen world. We have to fight our flesh daily, but love those who are stuck in sin. It is up to Jesus how He works on his own people, even if they are gay. It's not about behavior nor works. It's about believing and trusting Jesus"
Christianity,flnxa9e,t3_fpzm9c,1585327629.0,Amen!
Christianity,flnx5ic,t1_flnkcr9,1585327557.0,"I'll definitely pray for you. Been there before. I tend to listen to uplifting music like 'fear is a liar' is one of my fav songs. Another thing is to also tell yourself no and say the opposite. So turn the negative thought into a positive or even a biblical thought. I also read the bible to read the truth üòä 
don't listen to the lies. You are loved very much."
nosleep,flnwfys,t3_fptrfo,1585327173.0,"The car thing is really weird! I hardly see anything out of the ordinary, but I also don't leave the house often lol. The things I see and or hear at home are a different story. I know I'm not the only one who hears someone else say a word when no one is around. Or seen a shadow out of the corner of your eye. Not often thankfully, however that is enough to rattle me lol. Idk what I would do if I seen old beat up running cars with no one inside, in the evening with i presume a weird gut feeling. Some properties are just really weird to walk on Haha."
Christianity,flnuuns,t3_fpydh0,1585326309.0,"Some great Christians in this thread. You know God is the one who puts people in power. Maybe we should pray that the Lord guides this administration instead of bashing it? Do you think the Lord is happy to see us name calling and bickering and basically calling for our own demise? Jesus is perfect,  the President is not. President Trump is a fallible human man that commits sin just like the rest of us. We have been forgiven much, so we should also be forgiving towards those we feel have hurt us. God Bless you all ‚ù§"
unpopularopinion,fkrc217,t3_fjxpzp,1584465879.0,I agree. The media pushes it. most people agree with your statement.
unpopularopinion,fhzk6rf,t1_fhziaa3,1582001811.0,"Yes I understand what you are saying. I am just saying at this point that it's really all about perspective. Yes being a teen is hard. I remember being one. My mom died when I was a teen. Still my life was pretty good as a teen. I've read how his home life is and yes it is not the greatest. But neither was mine. Shit happens and we have the choice to look at it as we are victims or we can look at as we are survivors. Maybe I should have started with that in the beginning. I will now just say life in general is hard for anyone, at any age"
unpopularopinion,fhywl87,t1_fhyvtp8,1581985426.0,And? So does that mean that all adults have a life like that? There's billions of people lol I'm glad you have an easy adult life. Good for you. I hope the OP does as well.
unpopularopinion,fhrpefa,t1_fhcfj21,1581833430.0,"I will not. You made the post, so don't get upset when parents/adults don't agree with you. Maybe change your attitude and quit thinking your life is so hard because you're a teen. Remember we used to be teens once too. Yes school can be a challenge and life can be hard as a teen, I get that. But to say a teens life is worse than a parent/adult just means you're not mature yet and don't understand the real adult world."
BPD,fhih8ps,t3_f36wkb,1581624710.0,No. I try not to do that. I just go about my day feeling whatever it is I'm feeling. I let the emotions come and I go through them and then I'm done. If I can't get out of it someone usually hugs me or does something to help me regain my senses if that makes any sense
unpopularopinion,fhbr6yo,t3_f222v9,1581448143.0,"Look our jobs as parents is to help you live in the real world on your own. If we don't have you do chores,  you will not be able to take care of a house. If you are a boy do you think a girl is going to want to be with you if you can clean up after yourself? Some men expect women to cook. Will you know how to clean up and go look for a job? If you can't handle your parents telling you what you need to do then wow! You're going to have fun at a job. Adults have it pretty hard thank you very much. Have you tried to support an entire family? Cooked all their meals? Went to the store a million times for food and bought it with the money you made working? What about paying all the bills? I could go on and on. Being a teen is kinda hard, but I'd gladly go back to being a teen."
Christianity,fhbqdcc,t3_f29vh9,1581447642.0,"Good thing I'm not catholic. My Christian values tell me this dude doesn't have my vote. Anyone who is ok with abortion and says that Jesus basically says its ok really need to think through that statement. He died for our sins to give us eternal life, so why would He condone the killing of unborn babies that God in knitting in the womb?"
BPD,fh8vurr,t3_ev39x8,1581368425.0,"My husband bought me a guitar cause I had said once I wanted to try. Now I was excited, but not enthusiastic enough to practice. Started going to a class with a few friends. For me they go way too fast and then of course it irritates me to no end. One friend keeps trying to push me into doing it more and more and honestly its about to drive to throw it away. I am horrible at keeping hobbies. I used to wonder why and wasn't aware it was a bpd trait. Honestly made me feel better knowing I wasn't alone nor was I weird. Now if my friend would stop pushing me I'd be happy to learn at my own pace on my own. What's up with people trying to force me to keep it up. It just makes me not want to do it at all"
BPD,fgv0847,t3_f0gfht,1581133545.0,I know what you mean. I do the same thing but it's mainly because I also have agoraphobia so I can't leave the house like I'd like and man makes me feel like crap looking at what friends are doing. But i have to remind myself that I am enough whether I go out or not.  Though I think a lot of people compare themselves tbh
Christianity,fgrnaj3,t3_f02018,1581051379.0,üòÇüòÇ oh I so needed to laugh today.. the comments are just as great
BPD,fgl28ba,t3_eyunl7,1580879750.0,"Yes. I had to read it a few times to get what you were saying. My emotions are insane at times. When I'm angry (which is more than I'd like) I feel like a different person and my family says I'm not myself at that time. Some days I feel like different people lol it's so weird to me. One minute I can be happy as a clam and then wham! I'm ticked off by the dumbest thing, then I'll just feel nothing. I thought for the longest time I was such a horrible person only to find out it wasn't something I could really control. I was diagnosed like 10 years ago but I refused to believe I had it, but I have come to terms that it's ok that I have this and that I'm not a horrible person. I'm so glad I'm not alone :)"
BPD,fg7qga6,t1_fg7doi2,1580598889.0,Thankfully we can relax over it now :)
BPD,fg7b1s4,t3_ex82il,1580588204.0,Yes! And I here I thought I was losing my mind lol. I always think it must not be normal lol
HealthAnxiety,fg54hud,t3_ewq68h,1580518056.0,"For real. I had myself thinking I was going to die from a familial disease that runs in my family, that my body started mimicking the symptoms. Though I don't have anything wrong with me."
HealthAnxiety,fg3emi8,t1_fg2o1yp,1580479533.0,"Yes it definitely feels helpless. Most of the time if I step on the scale I get either sad or angry so I try not to look lol. 
Oh that's good :) yeah googling symptoms seems to make it worse lol I've tried to stop googling symptoms and instead watching TV or searching for something entirely different. I'm glad the aches and pains and have lessened  :) always good news"
BPD,fg2fj2d,t3_ew9mco,1580444029.0,Yes. I can't entirely say that's exactly what happens to me. But I do know what you mean. I just blow through the changes so I don't start asking myself why I'm feeling this or that cause then panic ensues.
HealthAnxiety,fg00kl0,t1_fg002bv,1580397516.0,"Oh wow. 
That would be scary to think you have tbh."
HealthAnxiety,ffz8sjl,t1_ffz88s0,1580367558.0,"Well honestly a lot of aches and pains and other weird thing are sometimes just from anxiety. I swear maybe our bodies just do weird crap because it's used to being scared? I don't really know but it almost makes sense. Some drs are either extremely busy or don't seem to care. I mean all the need to do Is alleviate our fears. It would be easy for them to assure us we are ok when we come in freaking out. I mean at the time we really are scared and view it as real, they should as well. 
I do have a fast metabolism and I'm tall so that doesn't help either. 
Bodies are definitely different lol it's quite amazing really. I tend to not count calories otherwise I become obsessed. Lol just more lovely baggage lol"
HealthAnxiety,ffz7sii,t1_ffz7eho,1580366649.0,"I swear they can never find anything wrong. Lol right. I'm deficient in Vit d as well as b and magnesium. Which make you twitch and then I think I'm dying lol. 
Oh I know right! Just goes to show you never know what someone else is going through. I just wish I was like others who can seemly go through life with anxiety and it not entirely wreck their lives. I do hope they can help you. I tried being a vegetarian and then I just lot even more weight, so had to stop that. Its entirely annoying and there is no reason for me to be like this lol. 
Weight issues either way sucks for anyone."
HealthAnxiety,ffz7ao1,t1_ffz73af,1580366204.0,Hey at least you know its irrational. I think that's one of the big things we can do for ourselves. I think it takes the fear away because we can confront the issue and realize that our fears are not real.
HealthAnxiety,ffz6xi7,t1_ffz5vnb,1580365884.0,"Damn. Are you sure you don't have like a mineral or vitamin imbalance. I think that's what's making me so bad lately. Are you eating with the coffee? I tend to not eat and then my blood sugar drops, which is weird since there is sugar in my coffee. 
Well I don't know what your healthy weight is but if it's not healthy in your mind, that may also help. I do think the way we think about our bodies has a factor in it. Personally I can't seem to gain weight and if I don't get to a certain weight I just feel icky.  I never knew becoming an adult came with so many problems lol"
HealthAnxiety,ffz5i2v,t1_ffz56fl,1580364677.0,"They do say nicotine can cause you to have anxiety. Shoot caffeine seems to do it to me these days lol. Well vaping imo is better than cigarettes. It helped me quit. That's what I did in the 2 years my hr became normal. Not sure how I quit vaping except I just stopped one day. 
After 12 hours, yes nicotine would be out of your system. I mean your hr is normal for sure. I bet after exercising it will go down. Excersize also helps with anxiety thankfully. It's like a win win lol"
HealthAnxiety,ffz568y,t1_ffz2yzl,1580364356.0,"Oh my goodness! That would be terrible to have worry you have. I'm so sorry :/ 
I wish there was a cure and all anxiety was just gone forever. I hope you find peace soon. I can definitely see how that would freak someone out though."
HealthAnxiety,ffz4zf4,t1_ffz3k63,1580364164.0,That's what mine was around when I smoked cigarettes. But now after 2 years it has gone to normal. That totally could have been cause you walked into the room. I wear a fitbit which is the only reason I know what my hr is all the time. Helps me to realize I'm not having a heart attack.
HealthAnxiety,ffz2u8q,t1_ffz27ja,1580362140.0,"What is your rhr now? Mine is usually around 65. If I'm anxious it's around 85. I've thought to exercise as well. We're already scared, might as well go run. Then maybe the fight or flight response wouldn't be so bad"
HealthAnxiety,ffz2468,t1_ffz1kzz,1580361487.0,"Well hopefully you'll feel fine for a long time. I know what you mean though, I feel the same. Like finally I can relax"
HealthAnxiety,ffz1znr,t1_ffz1ihj,1580361375.0,"Oh I know! I can't smoke indica because it gives me panic attacks. I can however smoke certain sativa to help. Haha I live in CO btw. 
CBD oil is great! It does not  have thc which is what is causing you panic attacks. If I smoke and then start to freak out, I take CBD oil and it calms me down. It's fantastic stuff"
HealthAnxiety,ffz0zpq,t1_ffz0rze,1580360493.0,"Yes I sure have. Took them for over 20 years and then the meds about took my life so my dr took me off them. I've recently started to take CBD oil and honestly it's been working so well. I still get panic attacks, but I can stop them with the oil"
HealthAnxiety,ffyyi9r,t1_ffyws1k,1580358435.0,It is awful. I get so mad cause I know full well its just anxiety but the panic comes anyways. I really thought I was just crazy until I read a post on reddit and I was happy to find others who knew how I felt.
HealthAnxiety,ffyyadn,t1_ffyy4zc,1580358264.0,I've noticed that. I feel fortunate to not have it as bad as some. Breaks my heart to read some of the things people have to go through.
HealthAnxiety,ffyvwwf,t3_evwn5k,1580356476.0,This doesn't make me nervous. Heart attacks and terminal diseases are the things that keep me awake at night.
ALS,ff9pmbi,t1_ff9p39e,1579718120.0,Thank you. I think that's the gene my family has as well. We just found out a few years ago. So its relatively new information to me that I could possibly get it. I seem to freak out about it for a few days and then I calm down and months later it hits me again. I think not thinking about it is probably smart idea. Honestly glad to know I'm not alone and that there are other who are possibly facing the same disease
ALS,ff8ea23,t1_ff7lc3f,1579674826.0,Thank you. I never thought of clinical trials. I know it's a 50/50 chance since it runs in the fam. I honestly felt better after typing it all out.
BPD,fdsmkho,t3_emyry4,1578705169.0,I'm so glad you're still here
BPD,fbe318n,t3_ecniiy,1576777086.0,"Most of my friendships are like that. I just gave up after a while. Which then of course the friendships slid into almost strangers. It definitely messes with me in a negative way. All I can do now is just focus giving all my love to my daughter and husband, who don't mind my love and attention. 
I once read that there is usually one in the relationship who loves more than the other. I don't remember where i read it, but it's always stuck with me because it makes sense."
BPD,f911bbz,t3_e324jr,1574980653.0,Thank you :) Happy Thanksgiving to you as well
