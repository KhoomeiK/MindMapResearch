Once you realize what it is-- you'll know if you have it. Answer these:

1. Do you find yourself shaking your legs a lot? If you're out at dinner or at home do others complain you're moving around too much or wobbling the table?
2. Do you find you cant rest your legs for a long time in the same position and have to constantly extend and stretch them to get a feeling of (unconscious) relief?
