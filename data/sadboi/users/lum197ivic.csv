EnoughTrumpSpam,fne4a35,t1_fndyigx,1586882799.0,"Hence why I subscribed to this sub :) I have little tolerance for TV pundits. During the previous election and after Trump was elected I did try to broaden what I read to include some conservative news in addition to NPR, New York times, etc. 

Personally I enjoy Charles Cooke and National Review. Occasionally I read or listen to Cato Institute and The Federalist. There are things I agree and disagree with from those media groups but hearing different view points has helped me understand how people can see an issue so differently (fun to go from Ezra Klein to Charles Cooke). 

From there I have my framework of what my personal political beliefs are (candidly I'm a Classical Liberal). For me (especially on the conservative side), it helped me understand how policy makers viewed the issue (agreed the average person probably doesn't dig that deep). 

Anyways my 2 cents and I do enjoy hearing what others see on these issues!"

I joined this sub when it was initially created because the degree of propaganda and spin I saw (i.e. spam) from The Donald subreddit deserved a counter response. 

That said, I wonder if we've turned into exactly what grinded my gears from conservatives during the Obama years. Any news or action from Obama and his supporters was dismissed and criticized by conservatives. 

Take the point around stimulus checks in this meme. Personally I can completely understand a voter (conservative or moderate) believing in limited government and that government's role should be limited to providing support under limited circumstances (war, the potentially largest recession and unemployment since the Great Depression, etc). 

It doesn't make these voters stupid or ignorant, it simply means they have a different vision about the role of government. I also understand and expect people to disagree on those beliefs and doing so doesn't mean the opposing side is ignorant. 

In summary, can we please try to not become the very thing this sub was meant to fight (narrow-mindedness and dogma)."

FinancialCareers,fmsh673,t1_fms3bqr,1586355383.0,"Are you trying to transition into an investing role (PE/VC), trading or investment banking?

Non-traditional laterals into finance can be tough after someone has 5-10 years experience and usually involves candidates that have some overlapping skill set (e.g. engineer that can help analyze reserves for an E&P group in IB).

Usually the folks that transition mid-late career bring something finance professionals don't have (technical background, deep sector expertise, specific accounting / tax knowledge) and because there are so few slots, finance firms have their pick of professionals. 

I haven't seen a senior hire into finance with 20+ years experience often and when I have it's been in an advisory role in IB / PE foe high flying former executives (e.g. former policitian or securities and defense executive) that can provide a nuanced perspective on policy and industry factors while bringing 20+ years of industry relationships). 

I'm a Banker so my perspective is a bit specific to IB more than PE / VC. 

With the appropriate context I could definitely share a more tailored perspective."

Injury Prevention:
1. Are you being consistent on the days of the week and number of times per week you workout?
2. If you're working a desk job (I do) getting extra movement every day was instrumental in preventing injury from lifting
3. Form form form! Getting the proper form and learning lifting ques was instrumental in building my confidence around not injuring myself. 
4. With regagd to programming, I think the programs you're doing are probably fine, but sometimes coaching or someone's who can adjust your programming can help. 

If you can afford it, it might be a good idea to use an online coach for a period of time. They can adjust your programming and provide form critique weekly in addition to other suggestions.

BipolarReddit,fc236la,t3_eff4in,1577338556.0,"I've used several of the meds you've named. Here's my perspective:

Ambien: It's lights out for the night but depending on when I take the effects can linger into the next day. It's kinda the ""brute force"" approach to sleep. 

Trazodone: I've had a very good experience with Trazodone. Was prescribed it even before my bipolar diagnosis. It'll take a bit (hour or so for me) to kick in, but once it does my eyes get heavy and I sleep through the night. That said, I'm still able to function the next day (albeit getting out of bed can be hard). It's not habit forming (like a benzo) and I'm not as nervous to take it if I've had a few drinks socially. 

Benzo: Currently have a prescription for anxiety and panic attacks. It works very well for sleep short term (my doc is aware), but it's also very clear to me that it's habit forming and tolerance builds quickly. Interactions with alcohol are a very serious consideration as well. I only take my benzo (Klonopin for me) as needed and when absolutely necessary. I can see why people get addicted. 

Finally, I know cannibis has a mixed effect on people with bipolar disorder, but it's worked wonders for me (but I do know some folks with bipolar disorder dongnrract well to cannibis)"

1. Consistency in nutrition, sleep and physical activity (all 3 as strictly as I could manage)

2. The ""right"" mix of medications. My doctors tried several and eventually found the right combination (for me it's Depakote and Lamictal)

3. Friends / family you trust. My best friend stayed with me for almost 2 weeks during my worst moments. My co-worker let me cry on her shoulder and was never more than a 10 minute drive or phone call away. 

4. (Most importantly), having a team of medical professionals you TRUST. My therapist was the one that caught my bipolar ii and the psychiatrist she referred me to is also phenomenal. They're the most talented clinicians I've met and have helped me manage bipolar ii holistically via medication, therapy and changes in lifestyle. I see me therapist weekly and the supervision in the beginning was instrumental. 

It sounds like you're doing the right things, but know it may take some time and if things get bad, please do reach out to your doctors, friends (they will understand), or a help line.

When I was recovering from my own weightlifting injury, my PT and coach said the same thing. Get even 20 minutes in during your busy days to keep your body moving and be consistent. Once I started listening it has made an incredible difference in my recovery (other days are an hour or two).

2. Keep it simple in the beginning. Something like Starting Strength was where I began my rehab journey with my PT.

2. Cost of entering new markets
3. Valuation that's built around driverless cars and logistics. 

Point 1: Low barriers to entry: There is little that distinguishes Uber from Lyft, Juno, etc. While there are definitely differences, consumers view the experience as pretty similar and as a result pick the lowest price. As a result, it makes raising prices harder and gaining market share by cutting prices easier (exactly the same problem airlines have...while some people care about the difference between American and Delta, most pick the lowest price). 

Point 2: Entering new markets is expensive. You have advertising, driver incentives, etc. that all hits profitability and cash flow.

Point 3: Ubers's high valuation was built on the premise of driverless cars and being a transportation and logistics company. Driverless cars require a lot of R&D (as pointed out by others) and frankly are further off than people anticipated. This point is less about cash flow and more about the need to invest money to keep the valuation high."
