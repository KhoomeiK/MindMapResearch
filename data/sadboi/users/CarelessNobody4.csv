There are a variety of good excuses I could use now to keep someone as a backup girlfriend, but that's all they'd be. In the end she wouldn't be my first choice and very likely not even in contention.

And I know enough from being on the other side of it, if a woman is interested, you can't keep her away. If she's busy, still getting over her ex, has family problems, isn't ready for a relationship, going overseas in a few months etc. These are just excuses to let you down easy. And in my experience women like to keep their options open more than men do.

Inject women with testosterone for several years and I think their way of thinking would change.

If he's younger this may call for more delicacy."
erectiledysfunction,foo1119,t3_g88r3d,1587930389.0,"Stop the vaping. I actually doubt this is the issue, but you want to eliminate any factors the doctors won't be sure about, who I would recommend you see if things aren't better in two to four weeks.

Performance anxiety when the woman is there is fairly common, but it sounds like you are having issues without anyone that you might feel pressured by. This would be a bit worrying.

Diet you want to fix, eating 3 times a day at regularly spaced intervals, the less carbs the better. Lots of lean meats, eggs, fish, crab, clams ets as well as different kinds of nuts. Make sure you are eating plenty of fruits and vegetables too. But this is all for when you are at least 35 and hopefully a lot older than that, a your age you really shouldn't have any problems except nerves.

So stop the vaping, if nothing improves see a doctor, a urologist can check things out and you may want to get test levels checked, although I would doubt that's the issue, but can't hurt. If they don't know, you've stopped vaping, then try a little viagra, your doctor should be able to give you some free samples. You don't want to become dependent on it at your age, but it might just get you used to the fact that sex doesn't have to be something that makes you nervous."

sex,fohbq7q,t3_g7gkbw,1587763305.0,"5'9 and 175 is likely very attractive to most men, although I wouldn't mention the weight unless asked, they will think that is far bigger than it is. I would bet the men will feel far more stress than you about performing, if it makes you feel any better. You probably just had a string of bad luck. Me cumming or not has little to do with partner's appearance or more to do with how I slept, what antidepressants I'm on, and whether or not I've been on a porn binge."
sex,fohb9te,t1_foh9rjb,1587763088.0,"I disagree that masculinity is toxic. But if it makes you feel any better, I personally lose a lot of respect for a man that makes it known he's slept with half the town. 

But maybe that's just me. What I was trying to convey to the young man is he shouldn't feel burdened by the current culture of trying to force people to be accepting of everything. He can make his own choices in whom he has romantic relationships, he just should try to avoid making those judgements outside of them.

Most people will never have sex with someone they consider physically unattractive which is the one trait we have the least control over, so I think however someone decides to select is just fine, they just have to keep in mind that the more things they judge on, the harder it will be to find a partner."

sex,foh5ww8,t3_g7funu,1587760894.0,"I think its a fairly natural feeling to have. Men like to chase (generally speaking). We also want what is more difficult to obtain, not what is known to be freely given. It's up to you whether you want to avoid women like that in your personal life, but it shouldn't color how you treat them professionally. 

The thing I dislike is men who are essentially one night stand pick up artists but look down on the very type of women they pick up. Doesn't make a lot of sense to me..."

sex,foh3gxk,t1_foh0isr,1587760104.0,"If I were you, I would just take a break from all porn for a week or two. Get your test levels checked if and when corona isn't an issue in your area. Not that gay or bi men have lower levels, but it could be a reason for your declining interest, and is a very common problem today probably because of pollution.

All that said during your break from porn, you can read the Kinsey Report, he was a sex researcher during the 1930s or maybe 1940s but pretty far back in the day. He found only a small percentage of men were 100% hetero and that there was kind of a spectrum where a few men were 100% gay and then most were in between with hetero obviously dominating the attraction but not to the extent people of the time would have believed. Not something to feel guilty about, unless you live in Saudi Arabia or somewhere extreme like that."

sex,foh1yd2,t3_g7fhn5,1587759604.0,"It's definitely pretty rare, whatever your standards are. I like thicker women, but only encountered it twice. The first time was as an American in a bar in a foreign country where we both were fish out of water. I doubt she would have given me the time of day in the US, but in this case got her number. Unfortunately I caught a cold, but fortunately neither that nor the cold medicine got in the way of 3 times a day (and a couple of days more) sex. I made the mistake of trying to wife her up about 2 or 3 weeks into the fling- not really marry her, just do stupid Hollywood things like bring flowers and stuff and try to talk about us being a couple. She made it clear she was interested in me for sex only, and as I couldn't handle it I agreed not to come around anymore. Thick thighs, with just the right amount of muscle tone, naturally tan skin, blonde hair, perfect face with almost violet blue eyes, beautiful calves, big butt but zero cellulite, soft skin, D cups roughly, She had to be a good 160 pounds maybe a bit more at around 5'5 but completely flat stomach.

That's story 1, totally true. Nearly 15 years ago and still pissed at myself for not letting things flow better. I would say the expectation of the time was right on the level of what I had fantasized, not much more and definitely not less."

sex,fogx4ya,t3_g7elu8,1587757976.0,"The question is are you turned on by men? Probably a frightening thing to ask yourself, but best to be honest and your friends and family don't need to know. For those who just want to get laid its probably way better to be gay or bi, I hear if you are even remotely attractive you can have more than you know what to do with. Just will have to be more careful of STDs and such. 

Other options could be lowering Test levels are slowing your sex drive or you are burned out on your hetero fantasies."
sex,fogvjod,t3_g7enx4,1587757448.0,"Probably best to have this on relationships or another sub, but internet dating, while not ideal is a good place to get your feet wet. I'm surprised I have more dates than I know what to do with, I guess I'm at the age where I'm only too old for the mid 20s and younger but the late 20s to 40 and open to dating is a way bigger pool. The problem I'm seeing with it already is some are too fast for me while others too slow (I guess that could be irl too) and a lot will say all kinds of lovely stuff and then you see them one hour later presumably chatting up other guys."

It's good to have a Trump type who will think completely outside of the box. In this case it was probably complete nonsense, but I have heard of other questions he asked privately which I think were good questions but he got mocked for. The problem is doing this in front of the general public, who can be stupider on a good day than Trump was in this moment. He has to be mindful that this is the time to convey facts and information, not speculations or questions."

Can't get the woman wet? Didn't do foreplay right or he's just not hot enough. Finishes too fast? Has no self control or just considered a bad lover. Finishes too slow? Probably a porn addict or not very attracted to his partner. Woman didn't orgasm? He didn't do the right things to get her off or failed to help her finish in other ways. Man didn't orgasm? He has sexual problems or isn't attracted to her. Some of these problems are better to have than others, but they are all frequently considered the mans fault."
