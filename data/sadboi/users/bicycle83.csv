Last year while I was walking through the city I was walking past a little boy like 11 years old and he looked very lost, standing and looking around. I wanted to help and talk to him to find his way home but I was terrified people would think I‚Äôm a pedophile so I walked on. Better like that, let a normal person or a family help him instead."

Hospitals can claim a much higher cost when it‚Äôs corona as corona patients need a lot of care. It happens here in The Netherlands as well. I‚Äôve heard it from multiple sources including someone I know firsthand. A friend of hers was terminally ill, got a heart attack and died. Then they tested her positive to corona, the family needed to put in a lot of effort to have it removed. Another story, someone who had thermal cancer and was about to die and they tested her positive to corona, the family persistently wanted to take that person home to die there. They tested her again and the test came out negative. How weird is that. Something is definitely dodgy going on and probably insurance related.
