Anarcho_Capitalism,fqqsti4,t1_fqqr95i,1589571322.0,"Actually I'd explain it differently. In a massive, non-homogenous society like America we have less strict, uniform laws because of states rights and what have you. That combined with ideas of toxic masculinity so inherent in radicalizing young men across most cultures here (whether it's your disparaged white boy, black boy without a father, or patriarchal tendencies in latino culture) you have an environment that allows for the violence we have. I'm not saying it isn't a problem, but just like drugs violence should be treated more like a disease that needs treatment than something that can just be fought with restrictive laws, punishment, and the equivalent DARE but for violence. Also, Karl Marx thinks the population should never be disarmed and I am inclined to agree."

XSomalian,fqompfj,t1_fqojybc,1589518950.0,"I have to admit something, I'm usually on mobile and somehow never figured out how to use Reddit's quoting system the way you did. Slipped through the cracks, and trust me I'm embarrassed. But in the order of your responses:

&#x200B;

1. You ask why a God wouldn't care about specific acts on a specific planet of the universe that he rules. I ask you, why would he?
2. In the grand scheme of things it means a lot, to us. I personally have not written a spiritual book, run for office, or psychically tried to bestow teachings upon anyone. I ask you, where do you believe the homosexuals, apostates, and non-believers will go. What should be done with them?
3. You are actually growing at a very observable rate. At your current rate as of 2015 you were 1.8 billion and in 2050 you are expected to be 2.8 billion, given circumstances remain the same. I ask you this- what would/will you do when you come up to a fact that is in opposition to Islamic teaching? Do those exist in your mind?

Furthermore, you are the newest Abrahamic religion in about 1,300 years. At that age Christianity was conducting the atrocity of the crusades. At 1,300 years of age (2,600 bc) Judaism was not peaceful itself. I think that the very thing that Islam is so proud of, an unchanging book, is what will be one of its biggest downfalls. That may have been a great way for people to live in premedieval Arabia, but the world is different now. And it is swiftly more and more different. The more educated a society is the more they shy away from organized religion."

XSomalian,fqoi3l1,t1_fqohjw2,1589515740.0,"I say this because the universe is much older and more vast than the planet earth. Earth is much more vast than the Middle East where this all went down. 

In response to your whataboutism, of course atrocities have been committed in the name of liberalism. We weren't talking about that though. As fast as Islam grows, it needs to and will change if it wants to stick around. Infinite growth isn't feasible in economics without change, and it isn't feasible in religion without change. Nothing is perfect, certainly not the Quran."
XSomalian,fqocxkm,t3_gjztv5,1589512455.0,"Bro if there is a God there's no way it cares about planet earth specifically, much less who's banging who on said planet. You can make good arguments for certain parts of Islam, but overall authoritarian, organized religion will teach you many circular, logical fallacies at best and has led to genocide and war crimes in its name at worst.
