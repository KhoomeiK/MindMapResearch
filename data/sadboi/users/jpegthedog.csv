BPDmemes,et171ma,t1_esxnkkg,1562392780.0,"I only found out I had bpd last year as well. Best of luck. Remember that ""hearing voices"" isn't that weird. There is a great Ted talk on it if you have a look on YouTube."
BPDmemes,esvwhnx,t1_esvkulj,1562305259.0,how long have you been dealing with this? do you have some sort of psych that you can talk to about it? are you feeling ok? are you scared? know that you can always DM me if you need to chat about it or just need somebody to listen. i felt so alone when i begun hearing things. im aware i am probably just projecting but thought i should check you are ok.
BPDmemes,esvuwjw,t1_esvkulj,1562304505.0,"There are maybe 4 main voices. At least one female voice and then the rest are male. I'm Australian and middle-class woman and they sound Australian and middle-class. They don't sound like anyone I know and have nothing about their voice that stands out. Normally they sound a bit quiet as though they are in the next room talking. When I have not been sleeping or am under extra stress they are louder and a sense of paranoia kicks in and they will insult me and talk about my insecurities. they can sound angry or they can sound kind. i can think of 2 nights i stayed up and had a casual chat with a male voice. i guess i should say that they dont have names and sound like a 30-40 year olds. It's hard to think of specific things they say because i have gotten to a point that i almost automatically tune them out. sometimes i hear music and it feels 100% real. this description is of voices when i am not in psychosis, if i am in psychosis things change."
BPDmemes,esv9gxo,t1_esrwtz2,1562295725.0,"I'm diagnosed with bpd and I have a few physical health issues (chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism and POTS). I got diagnosed with depression at 14, by 18 it became obvious things were more complicated. I first started hearing voices in my early 20s and soon after that I had my first psychotic episode that was very severe and lasted over a month. As a result I began taking serequal along with my antidepressants. I never hear people I know and I mainly hear voices loudly when I am stressed and/or tired. I can now generally tell if it is real or not. Basically I plug my ears and if I can still hear the voice I know it's not real. The first time was scary. BPD is a weird with all the random shit it can do to your head. My mother in law is convinced I have schizophrenia which kind of gives me a laugh because I'm so textbook BPD. It must get annoying hearing what you hear. Do you feel like maybe you hear it because you are worried it's what they really think or do you have a different theory? (I won't be offended if you want to keep it personal)"
AskReddit,ess2z5v,t1_ess2p8o,1562243711.0,I think this is the best advice.
BPDmemes,esrv71k,t1_esneutg,1562237701.0,I become paranoid and begin to lose touch with reality. I hear voices and I believe that they are real people. I talk to them. Delusions develop one time the main voice (who I believed to be a man living in my roof) convinced me he had been feeding my dog pigs blood and was goinging to kill my family in front of me cutting off bits at a time and getting my dog to eat it. I hear voices every so often but am lucky enough to not have a psychotic episode for a while. If you have any more questions I'm happy to answer.
BPDmemes,esnedoi,t1_esncgm2,1562130023.0,"I either tell people nothing about myself or everything.

BPDmemes,eqlrzhg,t1_eqlrd0b,1560149141.0,i will say the first year of marraige was so so hard. i would split on him all the time and he would want to walk out. we screamed at each other and i felt like being violent on a regular basis. we obviously also had good times. some amazing times. i wonder if it is cause we made a commitment that we stayed together. not endorsing getting married when you aren't sure you are ready though.

BPD,eppf79s,t3_bvfbgz,1559377310.0,"I was diagnosed at 27 despite seeing a million doctors, trying to kill myself out of impulse 5-7 times. Being on a million meds and punishing my husband by having huge unexplained mood swings on a daily basis. When I found out why all this was happening and that I had bpd  it was almost worth the near death experience that got me there. I feeling angry right now. Really I'm just venting cause my dad pissed me off."
BPD,eplpbq3,t3_bv4lgs,1559300730.0,Ok so I can relate. Ok have bpd and when we (me and my SO) started having sex it was daily and amazing. I would be high for hours. I guess it is natural that sex lives get less intense and as ours did I started to feel so rejected and doubt his feelings for me. Then we would have sex and suddenly I felt loved and secure in our relationship. So I've been married to him for 9 years and his job is manual labour all day so h we cones home tired. I have mostly gotten used to weekly or bi-weekly sex and it is still difficult. I am without a doubt hypersexual and the longer we go without sex the less loved I feel. I think the only thing that makes this feel ok is working on other areas of our relationship and communication. We discuss our sex life and relationship.   We talk about what we want and what we can actually commit to. It doesn't fix everything but it helps.

BPD,eoxsnk2,t1_eovg7sq,1558928410.0,Thanks for this. I actually feel heard. I don't think he means to do it. I was very passive for maybe 5 years and that is the person my family know but with therapy I am taking back independance and they are struggling to adapt. I really don't think my husband even knows he manipulates me but I have told him everyone can be manipulative. I told him what gaslighting is and he listened and apologised. Going from being so passive and trying to figure out who I am and what I want is a bit of a bumpy journey.
