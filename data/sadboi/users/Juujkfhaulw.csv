getting_over_it,fpdqp75,t3_gcvbnk,1588532303.0,"Ever heard of the spoon & forks analogy? Someone with a physical condition has limited spoons (kind of energy units) for the entire day, letâ€˜s say 15. Now showering costs 3 spoons, making a meal 2 etc. (of course what task consumes the most energy changes from person to person, just like how much energy there id to begin with). Once all the spoons are used up thatâ€˜s it, energy is depleted and you wait for the next day.

Someone with a psychological condition has a set amount of forks. The difference to spoons is that you can get energy â€žbackâ€œ. For example a shower for me takes 5 forks, but I get 2 forks back because it helps me feel better. Making a meal is 3 forks, but it also energizes me so +1 fork per meal eaten. 

I donâ€˜t think about this idea too often nowadays, as Iâ€˜ve gotten good at managing my energy levels, but it used to really help me when I was doing very badly (inpatient, not moving at all)

Also a thing to remember: doing something, no matter how small is better than doing nothing. Putting one cup in the dishwasher is better than leaving it out, even if thereâ€˜s still a mountain of dirty dishes left, you have one less cup to move now. An unhealthy microwave dinner is better than no dinner, a 30 second walk around your appartment is better than no movement at all.

- Engaging touch by kneading dough, popping bubble wrape, using a stress ball, massaging yourself with those spikey massage balls, taking hot and cold showers, gently stroking my body (specifically the neck, behind the ears, in my face, behind my knees. Places that arenâ€˜t touched frequently), walking barefoot, hugging a tree, sucking & holding onto ice cubes

-Enaging smell & taste by eating spicy chewing gum, smelling flowers perfume coffee or anything else with a strong scent, eating sour candy, smelling a spice maze (putting little bits of spices in opaque containers & labelling them on the bottom, then smelling them and guessing which spice it is), drinking coffee

-engaging my eyes by playing I spy, looking for certain colours/shapes/numbers around me, describing what Iâ€˜m seeing to myself internally

-engaging sound by listening to guided meditation sounds (like rain and the beach), standing in nature and listening to the wind & animal sounds, opening my window to hear the city noises & trying to determine which direction they come from

-my all time favourite grounding tool is 5-4-3-2-1: name 5 things you see, 4 things you hear, 3 things you feel, 2 thing you smell and 1 thing you taste. 

-reality checks: what date is it? where are you? whatâ€˜s the weather like? what are you wearing? what was your last meal? whoâ€˜s the president of your country?

I was terrified of sleeping because of this for a long time because I expected panic, thus increasing my likelihood of having a PA. I was on sleeping medication for a few years (plant based pills with valerian) & those knocked me out good. I still take then nowadays if I havenâ€˜t been able to sleep properly for a few nights.

Whatâ€˜s helped a lot lately is making my bed the safest place possibly: I got a loft bed (I feel safer in enclosed spaces, you can only enter the bed via a ladder and if someone were to climb it with me on the bed I could just kick them in the face), I have night lights to fall asleep (a star projection on the ceiling), I keep my bedroom door locked, I have stuffed animals with me in bed. If I panic/feel bad/have flashbacks I get out of bed, so I wonâ€˜t associate my distress with the bed. The only thing happening in my bed is sleep (not even sex). 

When I was still living in an abusive household I couldnâ€˜t sleep alone. Iâ€˜d only feel safe when someone slept next to me/watched me as I slept. While having someone sleep next to you is rarely a long-term solution, I thought Iâ€˜d add it as well.

Abuse is often â€žhanded downâ€œ from parent to kid, who then becomes a parent and abused their kid etc. I am certain you and I can end our families cycle of abuse.

getting_over_it,fht9aro,t3_f4mxu5,1581871991.0,"Hey, I see you are going through a really tough time, itâ€˜s good you reached out for help. 

What you currently feel is what Iâ€˜ve called passive suicidality - you donâ€˜t want to actively kill yourself but you wouldnâ€˜t mind getting hit by a truck. It is a horribly painful state to be in and it seems like you will always feel this way. When I was very anorexic I woke up every morning hoping Iâ€˜d be dead this time. I was still terrified of death but also just hoped for an end of the pain. A few years later I have to say, I am so glad I kept going. Yeah that doesnâ€˜t help you currently, but just know that you probably wont feel this way forever, better days will come. 

What makes you think a therapist/doctor would deem you a danger to society? If you are not intending to hurt anybody and explicitly express that, they have no reason to keep you in contempt. It is important that you can talk to somebody about whatâ€˜s upsetting you. Are there any hotlines you can call to maybe just talk it out? Iâ€˜ve been on calls with suicide hotlines for multiple hours before, however long it takes is okay. Can you talk to your husband about this, are there any close friends or family members you can turn to? 

You are not worthless, no mistake is too big to recover from. Humans can change and become better. It doesnâ€˜t really matter to me what you did, you are still human and deserve compassion. You deserve healing. You deserve help. 
Your post makes it sound like you deserve every bad thing that comes your way because of something you did in the past, but I donâ€˜t think thatâ€˜s how it all works. If bad things only happened to bad people, no small child would ever die too soon, no puppies would be left out to die in the cold. Depression is probably not the universes way of getting back at you. Just because someone has done something bad doesnâ€˜t mean they deserve every single bad thing that happens to them from then on.

If the victim has explicitly stated that they do not want you to turn yourself in, then that is a wish you have to respect. You can not undo the past but you can do everything in your power to make sure you wonâ€˜t hurt them again (by going against their wishes etc.).

Hope things will become lighter for you."

What has helped me (at least a little bit) is to remember that the only thing I am dreading is starting the task, not the actual task itself.

getting_over_it,fgyu6po,t3_f0uhw6,1581187046.0,"Hey there. Depression and Anxiety can affect everybody. Mental Illness doesnâ€˜t discriminate. You donâ€˜t have to have a terrible life to become mentally ill, sometimes it just happens. Plus youâ€˜ve had quite the stressful time lately! Moving, new job, not having your support system around, the car accidents. Thereâ€˜s a lot on your plate right now and it is completely understandable that you feel depressed.

Have you had a talk with a therapist about your thoughts and feelings? Can you let these thoughts out to friends and family, or do you keep it hidden because your life is â€žperfectâ€œ? An essential step for growth is to admit that something isnâ€˜t going well and that you donâ€˜t want to continue feeling this way. 

You are okay. You are loveable and valuable. You are worth living. If you need someone to just let it out to, Iâ€˜m here."
