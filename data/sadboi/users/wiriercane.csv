POTS,fr19pzw,t1_fr0wdlo,1589815883.0,"Same! I finally wore a 2 week event monitor and that picked up my PVCs. I wore a holter monitor and definitely felt at least two separate incidents, but supposedly it missed them.

Edit: also, do yours freak you out at all? I’ve dealt with mine since I was young, but I still go through bouts of panic when I start to feel them more. You’d think by now I’d be well adapted but they still feel scary to me!"
POTS,fr197fi,t3_gm2yan,1589815611.0,"Sometimes. It seems like some days my heart is more sensitive (best way I can describe it) and more susceptible to the palpitations. I also would have this happen after talking for long periods, like during presentations and also if I’m sniffling a lot during allergy season, so for me it seems very related to breathing. My doctor said mine are just standard PVCs though and not to worry, but it’s still weird. Is this something new for you, or has this been an ongoing issue?"
COVID19_support,fqj0p0i,t3_gj4w34,1589403457.0,"I hear you completely. I’ve been working from home so still rather busy, but I’m absolutely loving it. All of the little nuisances like the commute, unnecessary interruptions from coworkers, feeling like you’re pressured to look busy all the time at the office really take a toll. And guess what? Now all of those things aren’t present and I suddenly have so much more free time! I’ve even gotten back into regular yoga practice on my “lunch breaks.” Definitely not something I’d have the time to do when I’m in the office all day.

My mental health has improved immensely through this. I still have bad days with anxiety, but not nearly as many. I feel a weight lifted because I’m not bound or expected to go from point A to point B by this exact and specific time every day. I don’t even particularly dislike my job. I just didn’t realize how pressured I felt every day, day in and day out.

I wish this illness wasn’t around and wasn’t so awful, but I will admit I absolutely am not looking forward to this quarantine period ending. I have discovered so much about myself and I know that even with the best intentions to keep this positivity going when I’m back to work in the office, it likely won’t last long. I’m also very worried that my dogs will have some separation anxiety at this point."

Our organization has also determined that now is a good time to conduct our annual harassment training (which was already offered online previously). Last I heard, the completion rate was outstanding. I assume this is due to everyone actually being available and not really having much of an excuse not to finish it by the deadline."
POTS,fppirui,t3_geqbp3,1588803037.0,60-70 on average resting. No medications currently.
POTS,fpnzpt7,t1_fpnqp27,1588775744.0,"Same for me! Deep breathing exercises do not work well for me. I usually feel a skipped beat on a deep inhale (not every time though, and of course never when my doctors are listening!). Mine have been getting more frequent lately, so I have an appointment with my cardiologist later today."
POTS,fpdwrqc,t3_gcrb14,1588535790.0,"This sounds exactly like me. You’re definitely not alone! I just posted a few days ago as well specifically asking about heart palpitations afterwards, too, because that happens to me sometimes. My HR always stays elevated for hours after intense/long cardio or even a tough strength workout (leg day gets me every time). Even way before my diagnosis when I would run regularly, I just chalked it up to how my body works (though I always found it strange that anyone else I asked about this would say theirs would come down to normal shortly after). 

Like other posts have said, if you want to keep up with running, just make sure you’re working up to it. I know it can seem boring by practicing intervals or taking short runs rather than lengthy ones, but this is what will build your endurance and stamina while making sure you can keep your symptoms in check as best as possible. 

And don’t get discouraged! I’ve found, like many others, that I have good days and bad days. On my good days, my symptoms are manageable and I can exercise well and feel like my body is capable of anything. Then on the bad days, I feel like I’m never going to feel better and it makes me not want to exercise for fear of making my symptoms worse. I try not to let the bad days get the best of me, though it’s easier said than done. Consistency and patience is key here."
POTS,fp43xj7,t3_gb3a3q,1588291196.0,"Yes. I used to have to do 1.5-2 hour presentations at work and they nearly killed me (okay, not literally, but it was terrible). I often wonder if it had something to do with my breathing, like I wasn’t breathing properly while speaking so much for so long? Seems like others deal with this too so maybe it just POTS infiltrating another aspect of my life."
humanresources,fp1wbb7,t1_fp0g0lx,1588249594.0,"You and I have a lot of similarities. I started my first professional HR job after completing my undergrad, it was in higher ed, specializing in benefits but being pulled into the many different functions of HR regularly. I am happy to say that I’ve just crossed my 5 year anniversary here.

It does sound like the organization itself, and not just you. Everyone’s different, and some folks really enjoy dabbling in many different areas but some would prefer to maintain a specialty. But take the feedback that you’re getting seriously, and try not to be so hard on yourself. You’re in your first year after all. 5 years in and I still find myself questioning some decisions and processes (not as often as when I was only here 1 year though!). Plus, I think we’re all feeling like we’re pulled in 100 different directions right now with all of the changes resulting from COVID, which doesn’t help when you feel like you never fully got your footing.

May I ask if the different functions are laid out in your actual position description, or are these tasks that you’ve slowly accumulated? I ask because I found myself inundated with a lot of “extras” outside of my PD because I didn’t know how to say no. I wanted to keep learning as much as I could, but I ended up burning myself out with taking on too much. My supervisor was the one to keep telling me it’s okay to turn things down if you don’t feel you have the capacity to take on another project, which I eventually (reluctantly) did but I’m much happier for it. I’m finally in a place where I feel I can manage my actual responsibilities and still cross train in other functions.

Ultimately, if you’re unhappy and don’t foresee a way to change what’s happening, you might be better suited at another organization. I just wanted to share my experience in the hopes it can help while you’re still there, especially during this climate with COVID."
humanresources,fong26q,t1_fonbab7,1587918803.0,"I’d love to start something similar (or even a weekly happy hour) but our office keeps mentioning how everyone is so “zoomed out” so I’m not sure it would go over well. The only difference is it’d be nice to just chat and catch up for a few minutes, and not talk work stuff."
xxfitness,fo6kxpz,t1_fo5uf47,1587561339.0,"I’ve finally accepted this realization that while I love powerlifting, it doesn’t love me. And that’s okay! I pushed through for a few years but never made the progress I hoped for, and just kept hitting plateaus. It eventually affected my mental health as well. I finally parted ways a few months ago. 

I still incorporate the big 3 into my lifts (just not as heavy and not as many sets) but I’m experimenting more with yoga and conditioning now on top of it. I’m just thankful that my body can do these things and I’m in a much better place now mentally!"
lehighvalley,fnzfurf,t1_fnzf30j,1587393255.0,"This was a couple of weeks ago, but I did the same by going to the Bethlehem Wegmans late at night. The place was packed and people were pretty rude. I got maybe 25% of what I needed that night, and decided to go back first thing the next morning. Another mistake. I did one Instacart order from there after that, but I haven’t been back since. I’m wondering if mid-day might be better."

houseplants,fnpfwrd,t1_fnp8hl9,1587144801.0,"I struggled with mine too, until I moved them to spots where they got brighter light. This one gets a few hours of direct sun per day, and it’s just taken off. Did you usually keep yours in lower light areas?"
houseplants,fnpflb5,t1_fnp3o7n,1587144642.0,"I didn’t have much luck with them when I treated them as low-light plants (which is what I was always told). When I moved this one to our front porch and it started getting a few hours of direct sunlight a day, it just exploded. I usually water it once per week, sometimes twice if the soil feels really dry. I also use a regular indoor plant food every 3-4 weeks when watering, if I remember!"

POTS,fnim13y,t1_fnifg1b,1586982332.0,"Yep, sounds like we’re in the same boat! I was also told they’re not related to POTS, and I hate speculating because I’m not a medical professional, but I just would really think that the fluctuations in BP and HR play some sort of role, even if just triggering more of them.

I also notice that some triggers for my skipped beats are similar triggers for my other POTS symptoms, like caffeine, eating too much at once, dehydration, low potassium, etc. Sometimes even just changing position, like bending over. Do you notice anything similar?

One cardiologist recommended doing more yoga to help with relaxation which may help with the skipped beats, which don’t get me wrong, I agree it could help in my situation (anxiety sucks) and I do love yoga. But dude, have you tried changing positions over and over with POTS?! Some days are a serious struggle lol"
POTS,fniajaa,t1_fni211w,1586976741.0,"I also get pretty frequent PVCs and PACs, but I’ve gotten them for as long as I can remember even before any POTS symptoms — even as a kid (which they didn’t bother me at all then because you’re invincible as a kid, you know?). I’ve seen multiple cardiologists over the years because as I got older, I realized it wasn’t normal and there had to be something wrong. Thankfully, I’ve been told multiple times that they’re benign and not damaging to me. 

However, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t freaked out by them, even now at 29 years old. Some feel really forceful, and others a quick flutter, sometimes just once or twice but other times in a row. Mine also sort of ebb and flow in frequency. I just went weeks with only noticing a handful total, but with everything going on lately and my anxiety being super high now, I’m getting them much more often again. I feel them while in a relaxed state and also when exerting myself.

Your comment struck a chord with me as well because I just had another 48-hr holter a couple of months ago, and I noted 3-4 times when I was certain I felt skipped beats. However, my cardiologist said my rhythm was normal, so I have no idea what I actually felt during those episodes. I wore a 2 week event monitor in 2018 and that confirmed quite a few  PVCs/PACs and also one episode of SVT."

dogs,f6djpfu,t1_f6da6hl,1572794794.0,"Not OP, and as a disclaimer I am not a professional, but a veterinary behaviorist that I consulted for my reactive dog affirmed this would not reinforce the negative behavior. Many (not all) times, a reaction results from a fear response. A dog is much less likely to learn while actively in that heightened fear response reaction, so it’s extremely unlikely the dog would learn that reactive behavior = treats. That being said, it’s also then difficult to reinforce that new dogs = good so to achieve the best possible outcome it’s better to identify where your dog’s reactivity threshold lies (is the dog okay if on the other side of the yard?) or redirect the dog from the situation as soon as possible and then work with the dog where he or she is not actively reacting to a stimulus. MUCH easier said than done, especially when dealing with multiple dogs."

reactivedogs,ew27xl1,t1_ew1yt93,1565040309.0,"My vet does this as well and it’s honestly best for everyone in my particular situation. The vet is literally the worst for my dog’s reactivity. He just goes into overdrive, completely blocks everyone out. He’s usually ok with the vet tech, but the doctor is a whole other story. They’ve told me multiple times when he’s away from me, he’s fine. I’m happy to hear it but also feel really badly!

On a related note, when his reactivity at the vet started to get really bad, our main doctor tried something. He would come into the room, my dog would start growling/barking/lunging and my vet would just calmly take his leash and take him out of the room into the hallway. My dog would immediately settle. As soon as he brought him back into the room, my dog would turn around and start barking and lunging again, putting himself between me and the doctor. It was certainly eye-opening. 

Needless to say, vet visits are a sore spot for us for sure so I understand your pain. Ours is definitely accommodating though, as they let us just call from the parking lot to check in, and then they will come get us at a side door and go right into the exam room. If you tell them ahead of time I’m certain they can accommodate."

I’ve been following her for awhile and she’s a great power lifter, and was diagnosed with AML a few months ago. She’s done a couple rounds of chemo and is pretty transparent about stuff between the treatments and keeping up with training as best she can. Everyone is affected differently, of course, but her outlook on everything is truly inspiring. If you’re looking for others out there close in age who are also invested in fitness and going through treatment, she might be a good resource!"

One of my boxers also has a super sensitive stomach. I used to feed a few “high quality” foods too, though he was at his worst on Zignature. It just did not sit right with him. Honestly, the only food he did super well on was one of Acana’s formulas. We had almost no stool or vomiting issues on that. When the news broke on DCM, I switched to Pro Plan savor and things were NOT good for him for a little while there. I felt terrible. I switched him to the sensitive stomach formula at the advice of our vet and he’s doing much better. I’m keeping RC in mind though in case we need another option."

It’s 4-5 days per week and incorporates the big lifts with progression through accessory work as well. Each block is 4 weeks with the 4th week being a deload. She also throws in challenges — we just wrapped up an 8 week (I think?) pull-up challenge. Just supplementary things to keep it fun and interesting!"

He’s also leash reactive and anytime he can’t physically get to someone or something he turns into a maniac - barking, growling, lunging. Working with a trainer has helped immensely but he’s still a work in progress. I love him regardless, though! There’s something so fulfilling about the bond you establish while progressing through tough behavior modification."
