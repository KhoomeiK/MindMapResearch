Hope for today, live life beyond the pain of today and if tomorrow comes be prepared to overcome. There's always light at the end, but what no one says is how thick the darkness will become before the light shines.

Beyond depression and beyond death is only darkness, so be hopeful. Ponder on the best things in your life. Like what? Dig deep and list all the good stuffs, the good moments, the best moments. Find them, and you'll find the light, the hope, the beauty beyond the darkness. 

Don't stay depressed, do something about it and find those tiny moments you laughed, moments you were happy and joyful. Whatever they were, embrace them, take a moment and soak yourself in them.

If you're able to do that you'll be able to help others fight their depression, you're a hero if you chose to. Giving up isn't an option, don't think about death or how depressed you are just find the light, find the good in the bad.

I know you can, ""everything is possible to those who believe"" believe you can overcome and you will.

depression,feu6rgc,t3_eqm9ao,1579383676.0,"It's really depressing when you don't seem to find your place in life and what you're good at.

Let me share a little life experience (personal), and a movie too to cheer you up and make a point I hope helps you.

LIFE EXPERIENCE

I have a melancholic temperament and spend most times in thoughts, for some reason I broke free from conventional prayers as I got pissed with my folks and with God. Guess what? It was reliving.

I don't know if you're religious but my point is that breaking off from conventional prayers led me to start writing my thoughts and prayers and then burn then for it's no body's business what my thoughts are.

But one faithful day I wrote about this girl I had a crush on in high school but totally forgot to burn the letter. It was squeezed and thrown in the trash but unbeknownst to me my hanging out with my friend in my room he reached out to the trash and took out that letter and read it. He was amazed, I was ashamed and he insisted on taking it to the girl in question.

Long story short, people love my writing and then I found out I could write. So my dear friend, forget what people say and don't compare your drawing, paint or passion in life to anyone. Just express yourself.


MOVIE REFERENCE (The Upside - Kevin Hart)

I don't know if you've watched the movie? (No spoilers here) but Kevin Hart makes a painting at some point and it was super hideous by all standards of art (yet that's what art is isn't it personal expression).

I don't think your painting is as bad as he's, and even if it is. His painting ended up doing well (by the way the movie isn't about art or painting that's barely like watching Tom and Jerry cartoon and I'm taking about one cheese trap, lol.)


EXTRA 
I was trying to see how good or where my writing was by having people read my writing or give feedback but the day I learned of the ""poetic license"" I felt my education was complete. That gave me a whole new confidence, as the poetic license is also in my opinion applicable in arts and life beyond just poems.

It gives a person the (audacity) license to write jibberish, incoherent or repetitively sounding yet 100% original and regarded one's own.

You only get into trouble of criticism when you say you're writing a specific poem and then fail to the boundaries. But poetic license gives one the ability to write whatever they want and keep the intents to themselves which many people who read or see their work will give multiple meaning all devoid of tempering with the real emotion/reason the port wrote about.

Live your life without limits and you will inspire many to your passion and taste. But remember the world can only celebrate your work if you give it your best, unabashedly your best..."
depression,feu0z82,t3_eqm4tk,1579382070.0,"Thanks for the honesty and sincerity of heart sharing your thoughts.

If you don't mind I'd like to share something too with you that's personal to me and also at the crossroads in life when I needed to make a choice against my parents wishes.

I was dropping out of school, (at least in my mind I did) and left town talked to my parents before hand just like you did about what you want in life.

Later on my mom called me up and said she spoke with an uncle of mine and they could get me back in school since all I had was final year. But I'd already made up my mind and talked with them about dropping out of school seems that didn't sink in. So I came back to town, agreed to re-register and finish up buy on entering the school the weigh of it all came back at me and I remembered why I chose to leave.

Sitting there idly, wondering what on earth I should do I got a text (which to this day I don't know if my dad sent it consciously or he was moved/inspired to) from my dad and even when both of them spoke to me about finishing school his text was simple: ""always, learn to say no"".

I did say know to both of them, which was heard in my earlier decision to dropout of school and now being called back to get back to school and encouraged to say no, I took those words to heart. 

And almost like literally chewed up those words and ingested them deeply, subsequently I've learned to say no to so many things in life that would have been hard to live with.

Like you I was hoping for death rather than making a decision that would hurt or disrespect or go against my parents.

My gift to you too,if you'll let me is this. LEARN TO SAY NO. Whatever it is in life you know you don't want, just say no. It's going to feel hard it impossible at first but give it a try.

And honestly it's a simpler option than offing yourself, it's even a better choice I'm sure our folks would prefer we say no to them than kill ourselves.

I'm grateful you shared, and as a deep thinker I urge you to weigh your options please. Say no, and no and no and only yes to whatever you truly want in life. 

You want to be a salesman? Perfect, apply this to yourself and never back-off from any client/customer until they buy from you. 

I am 100% certain once you gear up and put your foot down to your parents about your decision to be a salesman you'll be a great salesman and I'm sure they'll someday boast about you and how proud they are to be your folks.

NB: 
Please don't off yourself, don't even think about it as an option, great minds grow from overcoming life's challenges. Someday you'll inspire and even teach people how to make a decision they believe in and stand against all odds to succeed..."
