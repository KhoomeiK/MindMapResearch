Boxing,fqq36dk,t1_fqpzes7,1589558609.0,"im not making a reference to his muscle im making a reference to his weight. im well aware that muscle in boxing means little for the most part, but joshuas extra weight means it wont be as easy for fury to manhandle joshua in the same way as wilder. maybe bulky was the wrong word and i should have just said his extra weight but oh well. also, i think wilder needs more space to work and fights most effectively at range rather than up close, but i think joshua can do better up close as shown with joshuas uppercut- hook combo which dropped ruiz. here are a few stats:

fury weight: 115 kg

wilder wight: 96 kg

joshua weight: 108 kg

see where im coming from? that amount of weight difference makes a tremendous difference on the inside. joshua would be much more able to stand his ground than wilder just on weight difference alone."
Boxing,fqq0tg6,t1_fqpvf0l,1589557448.0,"my problem is with this whole ""group think"" paradigm. each individual person is unique, and to judge them based the group they fall into is stupid. and this whole question of responsibility for what my ancestors did is also stupid. you can ONLY be responsible for the things you can control. you cant hold someone responsible for something they had no control over. say a man kills your entire family then kills himself, you cant hold his son responsible. it wouldnt be logical as he had no part in the action. its the same with race-based guilt. to blame present white people for the actions of their ancestors is like blaming a murderers son for the actions of his dad. its not right. i know many people may disagree but its how i feel because ive been guilt tripped for being white before. i dont have a racist bone in my body and wish that rather than people seeing someones skin colour first, they fundamentally see them as human. our humanness comes before race. but most people have it backwards and think that race should come first. anyway, this is simply how i feel and know that many people see it differently and that ok. i just think that thinking primarily in terms of race puts mental barriers between people that needn't be there. i think race should be secondary to being human because then when you see others u first see just another human rather than thinking he is this or that because he looks like x y or z."

Boxing,fpfusj3,t1_fpf2fqk,1588584300.0,"no. if it was a boxing match, none of these guys would beat canelo. first, they have to land a punch, which against an elite fighter like canelo would be next to impossible to land cleanly for someone with zero boxing experience. second, its a 12 round fight, there is absolutely no way either of these guys can last 12 rounds. canelo would just pick up points and evade shots for 12 rounds against these slow giants. the shots dont even have to hurt, they just have to score."

NoFap,fp1mioj,t1_fp1idcr,1588240691.0,"when you have a government that consistently lies to its people you learn not to trust anything that comes out of the mouth of politicians. this makes me question the validity of certain laws and whether they are in place to further their control over the human mind or not. the government arent really the true power, presidents and prime ministers come and go while the forces at the back that you dont see really run the show. this is why you see the world moving in one direction while officials of different views come and go. the direction of the world today is increased control over the human mind which happens slowly and incrementally so as to go unnoticed. the way you perceive and view the world is dependant on what you are conditioned to believe. your ideas are not your own but instead an opinion structure layed down by the culture in order to programme your mind into an obedient, *unquestioning* and working citizen. this is why certain ""drugs"" of the hallucinogenic category have been made illegal as it expands your mind beyond the opinion structures of the culture and teaches you to think for yourself. humans have forgotten their true spiritual nature in favour of materialism and pursuit of possession. we see this increased control in the rise of censorship culture where you now cant say certain things which is a breach of freedom. if you think about it, the establishment can literally condition you into any lie they want and you would believe it if it was drilled into you from birth. ""anyone can be president of the united states"" is a lie. presidents are not truly chosen by the people as you would (intentionally) be led to believe but instead chosen by the never changing hidden government who have ruled humanity for hundreds of years under the name ""Rothschild"". the system is corrupt to its core and most dont know it, living in ignorance. you can call what im saying insane, but do a little digging and you find that this shit is no joke.

Drugs,foxy573,t1_foxv7d7,1588160165.0,"thats not at all an easy thing for the family who do experience the loss at the hands of sick people. the reason the people should stay in prison if the crime is horrific enough is because there needs to be a payback for the pain inflicted on the affected families. how is it fair that the family should have to live without their loved ones AND with the knowledge of how horrific in nature their death was whilst the man who did it walks free and can still go and see their family? there is no way in hell that thats fair. the individual may have learned their lesson, but at the end of the day, who is the one who has to live in the pain of loss and trauma? the family would most likely, if the perpetrator is released, feel hard done by at the unfairness of it. that he should walk free while they suffer. i know if a close family member like my sister was raped and killed, i wouldnt want the man to be allowed freedom no matter how much supposed rehabilitation they went through. now i ask you to put yourself in the same position, if someone you really loved was killed in a brutal way like this, can you really honestly say you would ""find comfort in knowing that the horrible individual has learned their lesson"". he may have learned his lesson but you still dont have that loved one. the effects of his actions are permanent and so the consequences of those actions should also be permanent."

Psychonaut,fo4jd8b,t1_fo4g61f,1587505484.0,yeah it really is a travesty and hope that its something that our culture grows out of. humanity needs psychedelics to catalyse the birth of a better planet. they have the ability to change one for the better which ultimately makes the world a better place
depression,fo2ylu6,t3_g52eko,1587477054.0,"please dont. if its that bad then it cant get any worse. so might as well try absolutely everything to make things better. get some help talk to someone try antidepressants try EVERYTHING before you decide to take your own life. because there is no curing death and you will leave your parents in utter devastation. at least talk to them about how you feel first. i know how much it hurts and how much suffering there is and i really dont want to come off like im offering solutions or anything like that, i know what that can be like. but you are in a bad state and suicide makes it final. why do that when there are other options. all i am saying, is try everything that might take a bit of pain away and ease the suffering just a bit. believe me, humans are very resiliant and they can bounce back. its amazing how much one can endure. just give other options a go before you do it. i really hope things get better for you and hope you find some peace. all i can say is just keep putting suicide off. if you get an urge, put it off and say not today. of course there is little i can say that will sway you because you dont see any point in anything. but if theres no point then still just try every treatment you can get your hands on. good luck and all the best"
DMT,fo2vs3t,t3_g58w46,1587475270.0,"from the sounds of it, it seems that your friend gave you 5 meo dmt and not 4 aco dmt. the toad is 5 meo dmt. people report that the 5 meo dmt experience is litterally like sinking into non-existence or some sort of unified existence. when you take it your awareness becomes present in all dimensions, timelines and this awareness becomes one with everything else in the universe which is why it is often called the God molecule as it shows you the deepest ground of existence which is nothingness. this may be why when you experience it, you forget about being human and forget about your life and forget that you even took a substance. all conceptions that you have built up go out of the window as everything you have experienced is so different to this reality and so there are litterally no words in any language which corresponds to what you experienced. obviously dont take my explanation as the truth as its merely speculation"
depression,fo2sefo,t1_fo2g5k5,1587472900.0,"perfect response man. dont compare yourself to how others are today, compare yourself to how you were yesterday"
depression,fo2s4w2,t1_fo24bi9,1587472705.0,sounds like you are in need of some magic mushies to cure ur existential dread. in all seriousness though hang in there man. there has to be light at the end of the tunnel and some method to the madness.
Psychonaut,fo2r7jm,t1_fo23k6k,1587472000.0,"i know right. the government, propaganda and generational cultural stigmatisation has robbed MILLIONS of peoples right to embrace their own existence and realise their humanness on a deeper level. its honestly repulsive."
NoFap,fo2q30i,t1_fo2jy7c,1587471095.0,"well your not wrong. but i think u may have misunderstood my comment. im not saying to use it as an excuse to go fap. im just saying that there is a lesson to be learnt from relapse. when you fap there is actually a whole process that goes into that. its not just the act itself of fapping and thats it. it goes deep and there are various triggers and sub-habits which lead to you fapping. usually when someone starts, they try just to simply ""not fap"". but they dont realise that in order not to fap they need to first address various other sub habits and unconscious triggers which contribute to the addiction. although u may not intend to fap, if you do not get the subhabits into check and if you dont know your triggers and cues, relapse is pretty much inevitable. going in fresh u dont know ANY of the sub habits involved and what cues you are responding to and thats why it is EXTREMELY rare for someone to stop permanently on their first attempt. you cant do it through will power alone because will power runs out. the only way to do it is to learn from your mistakes and put the necessary mechanisms in place to make sure u dont repeat the mistake. the trick when you relapsed is not to just tick it off and start again because u will only end up back at square one. as soon as you relapse it is better to write down absolutely everything that happened PRIOR and trace back the steps to see what set it off (which is usually multiple things) and then make a conscious effort to modify behaviour and to be more aware of the pitfalls before you fall into the subhabit again."
DMT,fo2ooq1,t1_fo2aefg,1587469904.0,"yeah, its clear that the creator has had some experiences with psychedelics. there are a lot of cheeky easter eggs throughout adventure time."
DMT,fo29nmv,t1_fo281u8,1587454287.0,"well, the 4d cube episode is a bit more obvious as finn outright just says it. when the cube is sucking everything up, finn says ""dont worry, i have everything under control"" to which pb responds ""under control? my guests are terrified!"" which is where finn says ""yes! and there brains are releasing adrenaline, dopamine and even dimethyltriptamine in the pineal gland!""

the bufo one is a bit less direct. i only reference it because the character ""bufo"" is a bufo alvarious toad which also happens to be the toad which produces 5 meo dmt in its glands. also the little floaty mini things that came out of his neck are his glands."
NoFap,fo28v8v,t3_g586dy,1587453508.0,"oh man u right at the beginning of the journey. if you were quite addicted before making this commitment then it wont happen first time. its very rare that someone permanently stops when they first decide. it takes a lot of trial and error. just realise that relapse is inevitable and part of the process of recovery and when you do relapse, use it as an opportunity to gain insight into your habit and to know the cues and mechanisms involved in this behaviour. the one benefit of relapse is if you identify what led up to the behaviour and what caused it and to pave a way forward where you avoid that cue."
DMT,fo27qgh,t1_fo21q7b,1587452427.0,and there is also a direct reference to dmt in in the episode when finn makes the 4 dimensional cube. also the bufo wizard episode with the frogs is linked with the bufo alvarious toad which secretes 5 meo dmt
depression,fo25net,t1_fo19k7q,1587450499.0,"i agree. there is something in me that deep down believes in something beyond. not like religion and that but that if there were a purpose to this life, it would be completely inconceivable to a human mind or any mind because knowing it would be at the detriment of ones survival. maybe the answers will be there when we meet our (supposed) end."
DMT,fmlb8kq,t1_fmhnh3r,1586182870.0,yeah dmt is not so common here in the uk. ive only come across it once but have never tried it. i think your best bet is to just learn to extract it yourself

depressionregimens,fc6e9m6,t3_egf1uy,1577478512.0,i have dabbled in intermittent fasting and this helped my mental state. i would be careful going straight into 3 days with no experience though. first try 24 hours and build it up. everyones body is different and you dont know how you may react. but there are a load of benefits to fasting.
depression,fc6dy5e,t1_fc6c107,1577478299.0,stop comparing yourself to your peers man. its YOU. they dont matter. there a saying that goes something like: dont compare yourself to how others are today  but compare yourself to how you were yesterday. what can you do to make tomorrow better? even if its very tiny but just a tiny bit better. i get that it seems hopeless from your perspective but its never impossible to bounce out of that mental rut.
addiction,fc6a4g5,t3_eg62xq,1577475782.0,oh man thats tough. it seems it would make it extremely tempting for you. be careful. if your husband cant get clean maybe you should consider cutting ties to save yourself. of course its not really that simple but it only takes one time and your life becomes a crazy downhill spiral
addiction,fc69fim,t1_fc52ey9,1577475322.0,man its so true. its literally free sexual stimulation at an essentially unlimited access. i wish i had known this before starting. no one talks about it so not many people are aware.
