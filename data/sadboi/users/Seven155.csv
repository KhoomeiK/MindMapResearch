ShouldIbuythisgame,fo2ta46,t3_g5e987,1587473531.0,"If you can buy both, then definitely get them both. If not, RE2 is the superior one. Better puzzles, less linear, more to explore and over all a longer game with enough replayability. I finished the story with about 12 hours but due to replayability, ended up with 60.

On the other hand, RE3 is indeed short but very fun. It is more scripted but I personally don’t mind.  RE3 leans more towards action than RE2. After finishing the game, you unlock a shop in game where you can buy stuff like infinite weapons with points you farm by completing challenges. This makes it replayable. If it’s not your thing, the game might be fun but not worth the full price. I finished the story with 6 hours on the clock and 8 hours total game time. Now I have around 23 hours trying to unlock everything.

If you care about the story, RE3 happens both before and after RE2. They made a nice connection in these remakes.

Re:Resistance is pretty fun but needs some fixes. Matchmaking seems to still be broken since the beta. Player count doesn’t seem to be decent on Steam so I’m not really sure whether this game will last very long. If you’re playing on console then I wouldn’t worry much. Personally, I’ll just enjoy it as much as I can at the moment. 
It’s pretty much a “mastermind” operating behind a computer, manipulating rooms, spawning monsters etc. Your goal as a team is to solve puzzles and keep the timer up. If the mastermind does damage or kills someone, there will be time off the clock.

There are lots of negative reviews bashing the game but know that this is just a vocal minority. Over all, the game has positive reviews and it is very fun. Form your own opinion and don’t go around thinking “I heard this, I read that etc”. Most of these people speak in hyperboles.
If you’re doubting whether you want to pay full price then get it on sale and get RE2 first which is the superior one."

residentevil,fnwic3r,t1_fnwhe40,1587318926.0,"I think people are being extremely critical towards RE3. Yes it is short but it's the first time I see a linear game being judged of having 5h gameplay without the cutscenes, reloads etc included. Like, there are many games out there that claim to be 10h long and yet have 2-3 hours of cutscenes. For example Detroit: Become Human is highly praised. It has a campaign of about 10-14 hours. I just looked up on youtube for all the cutscenes and it's a 7 hour video. Sure, it has some replayability where you can choose different paths and get a different outcome but just like with RE3, not everybody is interested in replaying a game.

(I loved both of these games btw so, not judging the one nor the other)

Of course, everyone is entitled to their opinion and may choose how they spend their money without being judged. I rather have people wait for a sale and love the game than buy it full price and hate  it for its length."

 Some examples: I really enjoyed Mass Effect: Andromeda and I did not like Resident Evil 4.  
I'm currently playing RE3 (did not play the original) which as you may or may not know, has sparked some controversy because of its length. Even though there's enough content for 30h (achievements, unlockables, in-game shop etc) They cut out content from the original and made it very linear and some of the fans are outraged. Also, not everyone wants to replay games 5 times.   
I personally like it a lot. Even though I agree with all of these points, the game does have some qualities. Great voice acting, great characters, over all nice maps, fun boss fights etc. I'm okay with it. Not every game has to be a perfect 10. Not every game needs to be a 50h+ RPG."

Let's see if I can make it a little bit less complicated for you:
First run. You do not know the map, you do not know your enemies, you do not know the puzzles. You have to explore and go around to solve some stuff. This is why  the game took you 5 hours. 

2nd run: You know the map, you know the enemies, you know the puzzles. You speed run the game, you get 1h15min.

My very first RE2 run was about 9 hours. My last one was 2.5h
Is it a 9h game or a 2.5h game? Why do you avoid any of these questions?

Edit: Checked some Steam users and most of them have around 8-15 hours, even +20 so not sure why you're lying right now."

residentevil,fmwsqkf,t1_fmwrxzz,1586452367.0,"You couldn't be more right.  
I think I read somewhere that RE6 has now a higher score on Steam than RE3  which to me, it's absolutely wrong and people are blowing it out of proportion. I personally disliked RE6 and couldn't finish it. Perhaps I should give it another try.

I hope it doesn't discourage them either because I would actually love a CV remake. I think they released a survey a couple of days ago asking people if they'd buy another remake. Hope that goes well.

residentevil,fmjlk10,t1_fmjkind,1586132757.0,"That's because you open the locker in RE2. This is a small connection to RE2. Carlos takes the note with him. As a consequence, Claire (or Leon) doesn't read the note, opens the locker and the zombie falls out."
residentevil,fmjgnl2,t1_fmjg3wv,1586129939.0,Same. I'm going for that 100% achievement in this game. It's short but some people don't give credit where it's due.
residentevil,fmjfsj9,t1_fmjf9zn,1586129452.0,"Agree 100%. Metascore on Steam is a 76 which is good. It could be higher but PCGamer gave it a 58 which in my opinion, is very low and not fair. I haven't read the review because I don't want to spoil the game for myself but I will after I finish the game. I also saw the game with 178k watchers on Twitch (Top 3) on launch day which is very good for a linear singleplayer game so I'd say the game did well."
residentevil,fmjf6k3,t3_fvnivc,1586129099.0,"Probably because of 3 reasons: too short, cut out content and many people bought RE6 during sales and found that it was worth what they paid.

I personally never really care about Steam reviews. Yes, it might help when I purchase something but people jump way too soon into the review and give a bad/good review with very little too say. Others, when dealing with technical issues, blame it on the game and give a negative review, saying: ''shit game don't launch'' and leave it at that.

If you liked the game then don't worry and ignore the negativity. It's not like the game flopped. Judging by how much the media is covering it, it's a good hit. Probably when they lower the price or add more content (if), more people will rate it better. If  you don't like the game, then I'm sorry and I hope you'll like the next one. If you're doubting to buy the game, then don't and wait for a sale. You'll enjoy it much more."
residentevil,fmgpp46,t1_fmgp0ig,1586054583.0,"Absolutely. It's quite different from the other two. It has some complicated puzzles as well which will make you go back and forth through the mansion. Perhaps watch a bit of gameplay to see if you'd tolerate the camera.  
To many, it's still the pinnacle of the franchise though."
residentevil,fmgopxe,t3_fv6683,1586053880.0,"Yes, definitely. RE2 is amazing and one of my favorite games. RE3 is very fun but beware though, RE3 is a 4-6 hour game and you'd have to pay full price at the moment. Many people loved the game but the price/length is causing some  controversy. It includes an asymmetrical game but if you're not into mp games, then you're only for the story.

I'd personally get RE1 too so you can experience the mansion where the virus originated. However the fixed camera perspective can be off putting. RE3 is the night of the outbreak and RE2 is a few hours (or the night?) after the events of RE3.  
If you decide to get them both, I strongly recommend playing RE3 before RE2."
residentevil,fmgo45h,t3_fv66is,1586053448.0,"Yea I remember this part. Did not understand the joke but now that you point it out, makes sense."
residentevil,fmgno9x,t1_fmgmibk,1586053131.0,"Absolutely  agree. The concept is dope but I just want something to come back to without having to rely on other people. And this is not a Call of Duty game where there are thousands, even millions of people. I think there are around 4k people on Steam. Making it cross-platform could actually prolong its lifespan. Also, isn't there a singleplayer mode in Resistance? Thought I saw it on the menu but haven't actually tried it yet."
residentevil,fmglrzh,t1_fmgld4n,1586051850.0,"Perhaps I'm just dreaming but I can actually believe that they'll add some content. They did it for RE2 and I'm pretty sure they KNOW the game is short. I don't see why they wouldn't unless they really do not want. Loved the game, enjoying RE:RE but it just left me longing for more."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fmdq08q,t3_fumdsw,1585974462.0,"I haven’t played Doom Eternal but I’ve been informed it’s really good and has plenty of content.

RE3 however is a great game but pretty short. 4-7h of gameplay (or 5-8 if you count cutscenes, time paused, deaths etc) but RE has always been a franchise that never focused on long gameplay. It’s always been about replayability and beating the game as fast as you can. The asymmetrical game is quite fun but I cannot asure you whether it will live long and become a popular asymmetrical or die in a couple of months. I’ve played many asymm games and never got hooked but I’m loving this one.

(Personally, I paid full price for RE3 and loving it so far. I’m probably going to replay it a few times just like I did with RE2 and enjoy Resistance as much as I can.)

If you’re looking for fun demon slaying game with a decent length of gameplay and multiplayer (probably more content but not sure what else. Please correct if I’m wrong) then definitely get it. Just know that Eternal is what happens after Doom 2016.

If you ever played Resident Evil and want to experience the night of the outbreak through Jill’s perspective and fight one of the most iconic enemies in RE, Nemesis, then get RE3 but keep in mind, it’s a short game."
Games,fmdourp,t1_fmdla3m,1585973518.0,Yea Capcom has been on fire. DMC5 and MH:W are awesome games as well. Really happy for them and can’t wait to see what they have planned for the future.
REResistanceGame,fmdnp4r,t3_fumek4,1585972600.0,"I think one of the issues of most masterminds is that they spam as many zombies as they can. This leads to survivors killing them all and gaining tons of extra time. Masterminds should use their equipment efficiently instead. 

The game however, does need some tweaks and fixes.  Perhaps make equipment more expensive cause I always stock on bullets and never seem to run out or perhaps less points for mastermind but deadlier zombies. Hope they maintain this game alive cause it’s one of the best asymm I’ve played."
residentevil,fmdn7pg,t3_fumi03,1585972224.0,"So many negative reviews? What? The majority of the reviews are positive. Big streamers are streaming the game (saw it today on 3rd place on Twitch, behind Valorant and League). Why are we acting as if this was a flop? Fans asked last year for a RE3 remake and they delivered. People who don’t know the franchise and never played RE3 complain that it’s too short when it’s always been. Others expected a Resident Evil 2: Remake 2. With 2 scenarios.

 No, they should not stop unless they don’t want to anymore. We won’t get any in a long while though."
REResistanceGame,fmc5tbh,t1_fmc53cc,1585939447.0,"It’s not on the Steam store. When you buy RE3, you’ll get 2 games in your library. RE3 and RE:Resistance which you have to install separately. Might want to restart Steam if you haven’t. If not, you might want to contact support, haven’t seen anyone else with that issue so I’m sorry. Hope you get it fixed soon!"
REResistanceGame,fmbrdik,t1_fmbn21l,1585931808.0,"I should’ve updated my post but it’s already fixed. Probably because I was playing earlier than the release time so it wouldn’t come up as a standalone game in my steam profile.

I like resistance but I’m actually more hyped for RE3. Never got the chance to play the original one and I’m glad that it’s coming fresh out of the oven."
tifu,fmb0x9t,t1_fma7df5,1585915097.0,"Dude I always confuse Nicole Aniston with Jennifer Aniston. It's been multiple times that I've seen Jennifer on TV and I'd go like ''Oh yea, that's Nicole Aniston!''. Luckily no one in my family knows her, unless my brothers do but don't say anything to not get caught."
residentevil,fmaa2zi,t1_fma01f2,1585887819.0,"Tbh the mastermind shouldn’t get a nerf. Perhaps their special ability (like Mr X for example) should because it can be quite annoying. But I feel like the rest is pretty balanced. The more zombies/ dogs they spawn, the more you can kill and the more time you will get. I’ve played against masterminds who would go crazy spawning zombies and they’d give us an extra minute or two. Having a good team is very important as well. Moving fast and working together to solve the puzzle and advance

I agree with your other points though. It can feel “claustrophobic” whenever you have to fight a zombie in a tight room. Hopefully they add more characters and maps in the future. There are indeed not enough choices."
residentevil,fm9jk77,t1_fm9eho4,1585870045.0,Suck because of how it’s made or because of the bugs and matchmaking issues?
residentevil,fm8u8lm,t1_fm8tboc,1585856125.0,Not really. Remake is a way to re-introduce a franchise/game to old and new fans of the games. These games are absolute classics. No reason to leave them in the past when gaming is more popular then ever and people who were too young (like me) get to experience it. You're acting as if they've been doing nothing but remakes. They're working on a new RE right now.
NoStupidQuestions,fm6rbu3,t3_ftfigz,1585801083.0,"One of the biggest issues that I had with some of my friends is how addicted they are to Instagram. You see, the more followers you have, the more “known” you seem to be and the easier it is to get attention from people or even talk to girls (from a boy’s perspective). One of my friends adviced me to make an Instagram to talk to the girl I liked back in high school. It works like an “ego booster”. It’s sort of like a “flex”. Going out to a club, putting it on your story and keep updating it so it seems like you have an interesting life.

Thing is, it’s all fake. Probably a few of those people actually give a fuck. It’s all about the numbers but in reality it’s just a façade. I think it’s kind of sad though. I’m no one to judge but it sucks that in order to be “someone”, we need to have some sort of “fame” in social media, even if we aren’t getting paid or famous.

Keep it real and keep those good friends close to you. The others will come and go in dozens."
