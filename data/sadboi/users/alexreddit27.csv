schizophrenia,fgtlqrg,t1_fgtdem0,1581106246.0,"Yeah. I am hercules. My account got suspended for arguing on a music subreddit with another account and then using my hercules_rokefeller account to get around the ban. 

I’m just barely overweight by the height weight thing but I think most people would say I’m not. 

I think the lack of likes was mostly due to the fact that I have a hard time smiling for photos and I wasn’t smiling. Everyone who got a decent amount of likes smiled in their photos."
schizophrenia,fgst2ew,t3_f0bxip,1581092067.0,Have blood work done regularly. That should be able to help you feel better to get actual confirmation that things are ok. Not sure what type of cancer your uncle had.
schizophrenia,fgs9rtw,t3_f03lzv,1581077782.0,I get paranoid even when I start to have feelings for someone. I got hurt really bad and that experience and the resulting drug use trying to cope triggered my sz. I basically associate affection for anyone with pain and suffering.
schizophrenia,fgs9nq6,t1_fgrg188,1581077664.0,So weird. It makes me feel bad when I take it with food and I’m fine with it on an empty stomach.
schizophrenia,fgs30ba,t1_fgre2op,1581068947.0,Yeah it just feels good to get upvotes sometimes. I know it’s stupid. The meaningful responses and replies do mean a lot and are what this subreddit is about.
schizophrenia,fgr11x2,t1_fgr0m5z,1581035788.0,Sure! Thank you for your support! Hope you have a good day at work!
schizophrenia,fgr0yca,t1_fgr0e41,1581035727.0,I know. I drink beer. Beer is bad enough as it is. I started thinking about hanging out with him and having a relationship with him to be around that stuff but it’s horrible. No on ever says their life really turned around when they started doing drugs and hanging around with drug dealers. He had me do it off a knife which is weird. I definitely don’t want to be anywhere near him if he is selling that shit.
schizophrenia,fgqzg1c,t1_fgqz6k3,1581034801.0,I know. The good thing is that he lives in vermont and I live in New York. But he drives here regularly to sell weed. The good thing is that if they legalize weed in new york he will have to make an honest living like a normal human being. I’ll be so happy if they do. He looks down on people who make an honest living.
schizophrenia,fgqyxv1,t1_fgqyrf9,1581034478.0,I know. Thank you. It’s so hard. He has been awful to me my whole life and is worried about puppy pictures I threw away when I was going through psychosis when I just lost my mom.
schizophrenia,fgqygxq,t1_fgqxdum,1581034183.0,I’m having a tough day. This morning I was freaking out about losing SSI and having my student loans reinstated and later on today my half brother was harassing me about throwing away his dog pictures when I just lost my mom (his stepmom)
schizophrenia,fgqnco1,t1_fgqn8f3,1581027519.0,It was funny at first I expected to receive good responses and feel good about myself because this is about sz support but I felt so stupid.
schizophrenia,fgqat5m,t1_fgqacb3,1581020945.0,Thank you.
schizophrenia,fgq8kq4,t1_fgq865x,1581019874.0,Yeah I have beers everyday.
schizophrenia,fgq7hxc,t1_fgq76wh,1581019305.0,Thank you
SchizoVerse,fgq7gmy,t1_fgq774n,1581019287.0,Oh thank you! It’s just a part of reddit. I thought it would be easier as time went on but for the time being it is becoming more difficult.
SchizoVerse,fgq6imv,t1_fgq5wen,1581018801.0,I know. Me too. I tried posting a selfie to think I would get support and upvotes and it was tumbleweeds. I’m hercules_rokefeller and dealing with the loss of my mom. My account got suspended for arguing in a music subreddit so I’m using this one until my main account comes back.
SchizoVerse,fgq5d1x,t3_ezuth3,1581018169.0,I’m sick of this illness and I’m sick of what life is doing to me.
schizophrenia,fgq1n38,t1_fgq0pnt,1581016167.0,"Yeah. My self esteem is pretty much gone, I’ve never had much and I just lost my mom and now it’s all gone. I’ll make a wager and say I don’t get more than 15 upvotes if I leave a post of myself up for 24 hours. Idk if I’m even posting the image right so it shows up in the feed."
schizophrenia,fgpyipu,t3_ezny2s,1581014448.0,"My eyes are more schizophrenic. Lol. I had to delete my selfie to avoid embarrassment,"
schizophrenia,fgpxlhq,t3_ezvmh6,1581013946.0,I even tried posting one but I have an ugly face and only got two upvotes. Had to promptly remove my post to avoid embarrassment. Guess I was right all along. Congrats to everyone who won the popularity contest.
schizophrenia,fgpwkds,t3_ezswsx,1581013386.0,Congrats on winning the popularity contest
schizophrenia,fgpvxob,t3_ezuzyq,1581013043.0,I guess I lose the popularity contest :(
schizophrenia,fgptwey,t3_ezj8ek,1581011917.0,Sad I post my selfie and get two upvotes. Wish I didn’t. I guess I thought people might like me based on how I look but I’m wrong. Wish I looked great like you.
schizophrenia,fgpnc3a,t1_fgpn3vd,1581008255.0,I just wish I could do it on my main account that I post here all the time with because people would recognize me. My account got suspended for arguing with people who were being mean to me in a music subreddit.
schizophrenia,fgpmabb,t1_fgpm7bo,1581007660.0,Thank you! I don’t mean to be an instagram type person it’s just nice to receive supportive comments about the way you look as I never really get them
