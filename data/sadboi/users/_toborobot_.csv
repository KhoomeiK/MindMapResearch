ptsd,fnohza9,t1_fnni7ij,1587125602.0,"It’s very helpful thank you so much. “nothing in this world exists but those emotions and what happened” that’s how my mind gets when I can’t stop crying or stop panicking in my mind. I’m happy you mentioned that because that’s exactly what I was going through yesterday night. It’s good that you can identify what your feeling early one in your diagnosis, it’s taken me 4 years since diagnosed and I’m still learning why I go through all of this."
ptsd,fnohnsq,t1_fnnrwna,1587125333.0,Thank you so much for reaching out and for saying I’m not alone. It means a lot.
ptsd,fnohkhp,t1_fno71ek,1587125254.0,"Thanks so much for sharing your experience and time with me. I didn’t think it was possible for someone to understand what I’m going through. I appreciate your understanding so much. This morning I woke up well rested, I feel a bit numb but not in a bad way. It’s like I can see the good thoughts now. I’m able to see myself and know it’s ok to have those days and keep doing my best. I wish your day today will be a good day, you have given me an amazing hope."
ptsd,fnndq21,t1_fnndfk4,1587090022.0,"You’re welcome. My friend recommended it to me. You have to be open and really listen to the words you read. When you read the whole book in its entirety, it will spark understanding and self love to yourself and it will save your love with yourself and you’ll find your worth. Best of wishes !"
ptsd,fnndde9,t3_g2lwtd,1587089795.0,"This person will always make you be triggered, will always try to contact you. Even if you think you can’t cut him off, do it. Change your email, block and delete his number. Change your number. Stop using social media. They will never stop. What you do know will cause an effect in your future. I know this from experience."
ptsd,fnncz59,t3_g2synn,1587089537.0,The book “Women who love too much” is a great book for you to read when you are ready to see the reality of your relationship. It saved me in love. I truly recommend the book. You can get it on your phone if you have Apple Books app.

ptsd,fmcl5c5,t3_fuecsv,1585947771.0,Movies can trigger. Happens to me all the time.
ptsd,fltsy0g,t3_fqqhqf,1585486210.0,"You’re so brave for sharing your story. The range of emotions will come and go. They will feel intense now, but something I have learned after 4 years is that emotions come and they go...it might take months at first, or weeks, or a whole season, or a few days, or a few minutes or seconds. But know the sensations and emotions will pass. This has helped me tremendously with my ptsd. 
It’s not easy. But with time and all the emotions things will seem a bit less intense. Therapy helps so much."
ptsd,flm2ko0,t1_fl5rb8v,1585273117.0,"This is how I feel. I feel like it’s a loop, a circle that you can’t escape from. I’ve been going to counseling since 2016 and I am doing better than I was back then, back then I would look at myself in the mirror and I had no idea who the body I was in was. It was not mine. That feeling has gone. I still have days of doom. Like today. Everyday is different, but know i got myself’s love. I find myself saying to myself “I got you, it’s ok you’re feeling like this, we will get through this, I’ll take care of you :)” and sometimes it makes me calm. Body sensations are so hard to accept at the moment, and trying to avoid them has caused me pain. Sometimes I name the sensation and I am able to come back and go on with my day without it being too triggered."

ptsd,fllxwdo,t1_fl5wlb6,1585270087.0,"There have been moments when I feel absolutely amazing, where my chest doesn’t hurt, doesn’t feel heavy, and when my mind is not thinking of any trauma. It feels amazing, that feeling that nothing is wrong. I want that everyday, it is sad that I don’t get that often."
ptsd,fllsqsg,t1_fl3ayox,1585266972.0,This is exactly how I feel. I don’t want to be touched by anyone
