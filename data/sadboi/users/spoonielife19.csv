BPD,eyqht1b,t3_cy3on3,1567343547.0,"I can definitely empathise with this. I have fleeting hobbies like the best borderline. A month max and I can be obsessed, wether it's an arts/craft, a mobile game, an activity... But then I have long time passions that I want to really make something of but I just feel like there's this invisible wall that I crash into."
BPD,eyj3ozf,t1_eyiwypb,1567112023.0,Yup. Can't sleep? Overthink. Standing still? Overthink. Breathing? Overthink.
BPD,eyilvaz,t3_cwytkx,1567104188.0,"This is it, 100%. Ive recently reached a point where i have had to stop and realise how much I've been letting the BPD ruin everything. How terrible of a person I've been for too long."
BPD,exlmprd,t3_ctgwti,1566415657.0,I'm overly-attatched to my dog for sure üêæüêæ
BPD,ex6fh0c,t3_crhw0x,1566044783.0,I find all this hard too. Especially the change in tones of the voice and getting near hysterical when we argue.
BPD,ew41gan,t3_cml7m2,1565100565.0,I am right there with you. DM if you ever need a chat :)
BPD,ev867z8,t1_ev85q51,1564270391.0,"Hey, thank you for replying. I've been reading a lot about the combination of BPD symptoms imitating true 'mania' Vs those with BPD actually having manic episodes. And the majority I have come across seem to say it's just symptomatic. 
For me I always say manic/mania cos that's how I feel... I feel unstoppable and happy and self-inflated and along with that comes a near painfully high sex drive. Like it's all I want 24/7 and gets me in so much trouble."
BPD,eughi76,t3_cg60sc,1563807970.0,"Definitely! I constantly need to be overstimulated it feels like. For example right now the TV is on playing YT videos, I have the laptop open browsing the internet, I'm on my phone and I have a pile of books beside me. 
I can't sit and do just one thing at a time because I get angry and upset when I'm bored, always have done as long as I can remember."
BPD,etr48cg,t3_cd2v5c,1563111925.0,"I'll chat too! 

I get this a lot. I make new friends, or at least in my head I think we are friends, and then everything just becomes about them and talking to them.

I also have boundary issues with friendships becoming more."
