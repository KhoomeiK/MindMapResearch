1. It affected my self-esteem, so I went to the guidance counselor a lot as a kid. 

2. I usually stay away from social-conflict, but I stand my ground and confront the person.

3. No, I don’t think so. In fact, it made things worse for me.

4. Yes, I’ve been super distant and paranoid of others. I can’t bring myself to trust them.

5. Nope, I still believe I’m ugly and have no personality. Which sucks, being bullied a lot as a young child will REALLY leave a mark on you for the rest of your life. In fact, I resent my life because of this."
