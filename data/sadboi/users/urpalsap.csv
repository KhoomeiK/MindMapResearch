i feel so fucking bad. i'm such a dick. i had (have?) the greatest friendship with a great person that actually GETS me and i ruined it. he was the only person that really genuinely cared and put genuine effort into being my friend. i told him about my shitty anxiety disorder (selective mutism) and he cared. he put effort into understanding. he didn't hate me or think i was weird like i expect from everybody else. he even offered to help me with my anxiety and never pressured me to interact or talk. he showed me probably 99% of my favorite bands and honestly influenced my style of playing guitar. i could say way more, but i really suck with words. fuck.

""That Tuesday, reservations were made for Kurt to fly to Los Angeles, and Krist was enlisted to take him to the airport. When Kurt arrived at Krist's house, it was obvious he did not want to go. As they took the 25-minute drive, Kurt sobbed and yelled and screamed. On Interstate 5, near the Tukwila exit, Kurt tried to open the door and jump from the moving car. Krist couldn't believe this was happening, yet with his long arms he managed to hold on to Kurt as he drove, even as his car swerved. They made it to the airport a few minutes later, but Kurt hadn't improved: Krist had to drag him by the collar, the way a schoolmaster might escort a ruffian to the principal's office. In the main terminal, Kurt punched Krist in the face and attempted to flee. Krist tackled him, and a wrestling match ensued. The two old friends brawled on the floor of the crowded airport terminal, cursing and punching each other like two drunks in an Aberdeen bar brawl. Kurt freed himself from his friend's grasp and ran through the building screaming, ""Fuck you!"" as shocked passengers looked on. The last Krist saw of Kurt was his blond mop turning the corner."""
