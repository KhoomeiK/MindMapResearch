depression,fed2kvi,t1_fed1810,1578995592.0,"I'm taking 2 different medications, they mainly just make me feel empty and emotionless, really detached from everything around me.
This stops me from having super depressive moments but I never really feel happy too.
It's not your parents decision whether you take medication, it's yours. 
My parents were very against me taking medication too when I started, but when they saw that I was no longer having extremely bad moments they understood that it is not good but necessary that I take medication.
Seriously though your parents have no right to decide if you take medication, they cant stop you if you do too. 
They mean well I'm sure, medication does have a bad stigma so I understand how they might feel, but it's really different for every person.
Using the rubber band is only a short term solution I'm afraid, but it will help you for now.
Also sometimes medications can be terrible for some people so I'd recommend doing some research online about the side effects.
I've been through 5 different medications now before finding one that works, and some of the past medications I tried made me feel very suicidal and gave me terrible mood swings and other side effects.
Talk to your doctor about all this though, they will be able to decide what will work best for you, not your parents."
depression,fed0f4u,t3_eoitce,1578992433.0,"Rubber band is a far safer and more controlled way of managing self harm.

My psychiatrist recommended this for me too, the rubber band is always on my wrist wherever I am so it makes it very convenient when having urges."

Sadly this is how a lot of people are like though, people who have never had to deal with depression or are uneducated often make these little ideas for themselves about what they think of it. 

Honestly if your friends have said something like this they are pretty shitty people regardless of not being educated on mental health.

I've had a similar experience with friends before, and it really hurts when they come out with things like this. Only thing you can do is except that's just how they are and avoid them."

I stupidly tried cocaine a few years back out of curiosity. I was on antidepressants at the time, had a terrible reaction to it. Full on panic attack for 5 hrs straight, never been so scared in my life, thought I was going to die.

Got severe paranoia too so I didn't call an ambulance nor anything as I thought at the time I was going to get arrested. 

Was up the whole night smoking cigarettes constantly which helped a bit with the anxiety, called a gp in the morning and got some diazapam. Immediately felt better when it kicked in, felt completely normal and relaxed again."

Honestly I think going to a+e is a good decision considering your heart condition. Best to be safe with people who can help you.
