bipolar,fmr6trz,t1_fmdecyg,1586315241.0,"Thank you so much for such a thoughtful response. I'm starting to feel better. I've been just sitting on my hands I feel like. I live with my family so I've just tried to be available to do things with them more. Let them keep me busy. And I got honest with my psychologist which helps ha. I started using voice to text and logging when I get triggered and like just talking about the stuff that's been making me feel over the edge. Trying to take control. I got a whiteboard to keep track of the day and my homework so then like I don't forget and then I can try n put some of my energy into that. And working out. Again, thanks so much."
mentalhealth,fjk5aa8,t3_fdona6,1583420353.0,"I felt like I was meant to read this
I keep wanting to hitup my ex boyfriend because of closure basically or something
I'm looking for something to make everything make sense 
But like it's a waste of time
I can't do anything about  yesterday I can't do anything tomorrow
I can do today and set up a better tomorrow
But tryna get back something I never lost 
Is totally counterproductive
Basically what u said but u said it very poignantly 
I can tell u were in a passionate frenzy of thought
Things like that only come out in a certain space, like state of mind 
Idk if u Kno what I'm talking bout...i feel like God is working and speaking thru u 
Cuz that's some truth"

Advice,ffno7ui,t3_eu9z4f,1580068454.0,You just have a big heart and are aware of the sadness and hurt in the world. You sound very introspective. You have a quality many people don't have. I got to the point I was so troubled by stuff like that that I felt guilty that I was so fortunate as to not have gone through those experiences that I started thinking that j didn't deserve to have such a good life and I started punishing myself thru drinking and stuff and eventually it lead to very risky behavior until I was the person that I had seen or read about bad stuff happening to them. Whatever you do...don't let it consume u. What helps me to no longer let things consume me I using my gift of empathy to help others. I try to only promote things that are lovely and beautiful. I instead try to focus and read and watch things that are positive or showcase the goodness in the world. Instead of letting my mind drift to the negative or let myself be susceptible to that all I actively seek goodness. It's a lot of work...but it's rlly rewarding...and instead of going inward I then have the power to reach outward. Idk I hope that helps somehow. You are not alone. You are a very pure person. You are a light in this world. Don't let the world pollute u. Or swallow u into darkness.
Advice,fbclj9x,t1_fb64dbv,1576726833.0,I really appreciate your response I really relate
Advice,fb5qmkx,t3_ebgh54,1576532543.0,No u have the right to feel whatever u feel and how u feel is not abnormal and if anything most people would react like you did. Its rare someone would go.
Advice,fa0s2zo,t3_e7escq,1575759416.0,"IT IS NOT CHILD PORN. that is fucked up to say. They just are overprotective and love their kid. Wtf is wrong with ppl. 
They just are afraid cuz ur growing up and they're scared and they want the best for you...they rlly love u and that's frustrating 
But just remember that"
pitbulls,fa0ru07,t1_f6wtpl0,1575759271.0,Thanks that is a good way to get started :) he just finished his classes and he's doing better. But if it goes back to how it was or it starts not working I'm going to do it as well as the halter thing someone else reccomended. I would try sooner I just have like no money right now and my mom is with him most of the time rn and  she wont  implement anything I say we should try...but I can feel her giving in soon.

pitbulls,f6wjbt8,t1_f53zeiy,1573227912.0,I'm researching it now....idk if he would respond or even hear clicking. He is always so overstimulated he barely comes for treats. Like even if a dog starts humping him he will just keep playing not even look back lol but I will def look into it rn. Thank you.
pitbulls,f6wj4vt,t1_f53z4c7,1573227785.0,"Okay. Note taken. Bad advice I got! The leash isn't even long enough to do it, and I can't bear to actually ""STRIKE"" him or ever did or ever would. But I'm finding that the harsh approach does not work. Like even using a Stern voice. I have been using training treats. Got like a pound at Petco...and while we walk if he keeps the leash loose so he's closer to me he gets treats. I also now use a longer normal leash. Thank you for your feedback."
pitbulls,f6wis6z,t1_f544ocl,1573227554.0,Finally subscribed and I am going to start watching some now on the treadmill. Thank you so much for sharing your time and experience with me!!!
pitbulls,f62xz3g,t1_f58hhl8,1572668710.0,Thank you so much for such a thorough and thoughtful response! I didn't know that your supposed to wean them off easy walkers and such. I will def look into a head halter right now.
pitbulls,f62x4lr,t1_f5rm34n,1572668383.0,Just brought him to the vet actually! Thank you!!! We r doing great.
Advice,f5af6ti,t3_dn9jts,1572106257.0,"I totally understand where your coming from. You are very brave to not give in. She will thank you in the end. It might backfire as a teen and teenager in some ways. She will be angry and frustrated and probably continue feeling ""different"". But in the long run she will be more successful and a more developed person and will thank you. 
My mom raised me how she was raised in the 70s. I hated her and didn't talk to her for a couple years even. Now I've realized she's the most amazing strongest women imaginable. I'm so proud to be her daughter. We are best friends. She motivates and inspires me everyday.
You are an amazing mother. God bless you and your daughter. Even though she's young just start repeating positive mantras to her all the time. Keep having those real convos. Help her find some sort of artist who you think emulates good qualities and characteristics and messages within their music that she can listen to and always be reminded of what rlly matters in life. I'm totally thinking about the movie Dumplin. But that's a rlly good way to have a safe place and to always have something to tap into whenever she gets down. 
You should get her into girl scouts or something. Youth Group. That's where I found other kids who cared about bigger picture stuff and were more considerate."

Of everything"
mentalhealth,f3z9zyj,t3_diumcx,1571264716.0,"
It doesn't define u any more
Don't let them win
Ur so brave to even talk about it online of all places 
Like look at today and embrace all the ways it doesn't effect u isn't apparent in the world outside of u
And savor those little things
A nice cup of tea 
Find a beautiful place in nature that is just yours
It helps to spend time there with someone u love and loves u unconditionally like even a pet
That builds the connection to that place
Idk I'm sorry ur prob not looking for advice or need it
But u deserve to enjoy what life is rlly all about and has to offer 
But I don't want to say ""oh that's horrible"" or ""I'm sorry"" cuz ur not a sorry person and there's nothing to be sorry about 
It isn't a reflection of u
It's a reflection of them
All u r is a wiser more developed person 
For those experiences 
And no one may say it in real life 
But the fact u still walk around in itself is intimidating
U have power and grit others don't 
And will never even understand 
That's why sometimes it feels no one is on ur level 
So sometimes it's kind of fun when shit still does happen and u can say they have no idea where I've come from 
They don't need to know 
I'm sacred 
My experiences are sacred 
Because they define me my reality and a world only known to me
That's pretty incredible
You are nothing short of miraculous and God loves you very much"

Advice,f3gd9tn,t3_dgvy8b,1570909964.0,I'm so sorry you are experiencing this. It is best to try n create a mental block...now that u r older u can start looking at ur dad like he is just another man in the world. Not ur dad. It makes things a lot more bearable...and helps to not make things about urself ...and easier and more comfortable to put up boundaries etc without feeling guilt or shame and disgusted about it and everything.
