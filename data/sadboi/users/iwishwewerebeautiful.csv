[Keep It Safe](https://archiveofourown.org/works/14241009): By whatwashernameagain, follows Roman after chapter 12

[Mine to Protect](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16949982): By whatwashernameagain, follows Logan after chapter 23

[Keep Them Safe](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13720047): By NoctisValex, follows another author's OCs in the same universe

[Sleep is for the weak](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15341316): By SleeplessInGeneral, follows Remy Sanders' backstory in the same universe

Is it that the Dark Sides can't hurt Thomas without permission? Or that the Sides can't conjure anything for him, but can move real-world things around?
