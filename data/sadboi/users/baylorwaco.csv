SuicideWatch,eoqyms2,t3_bsuyuj,1558798559.0,"Proud of you for walking back from the brink. I know everyone’s personal struggle is different. But you can get through this. There isn’t a person alive who doesn’t have serious self-doubt. I’ve had that cold shotgun in my mouth, heard that unmistakable click of loading the shell. I’ve had the suicide notes laid out on the table. And I’m still here. You can do this. And life could be better than ever. For me, I got medicine and a therapist. It’s not an overnight fix because your problems weren’t created overnight either. You can do this. Just choose that next right thing"
SuicideWatch,eoqx9w1,t3_bsvdlf,1558798043.0,That’s a beautiful letter. You’re a kind person with a giving heart. I wrote some like your letter a few years ago. But then I burned them. I’m better now. I know all of our struggles are different. But you can make it through this. Just do the next right thing. Get a psychiatrist and a counselor. You can get through this. Just a moment at a time.
