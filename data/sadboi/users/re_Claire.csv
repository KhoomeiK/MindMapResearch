I do not know whether he is an anti Semite or not but he made a lot of excuses and was very defensive when asked about anti Semitism in the party and wouldn‚Äôt apologise until pressed to. 

He did absolutely nothing whilst article 50 was being triggered, and forced his MPs to vote for it. He repeatedly went against the whip when he was a backbencher but once the leader he tolerated nothing but complete capitulation. He ignored the fact that a lot of labour MPs represented constituencies that were overwhelmingly remain. 

He then followed this up with ‚ÄúThe real fight starts now‚Äù. Like, what?? Why weren‚Äôt you fighting before? 

He refused to back the idea of a government of unity Because for him there was nothing but him being in power. 

He refused to step down after they lost the 2017 election, and also refused to step down after he lost a VONC twice. That kind of shit scares me. That‚Äôs not democracy. 
The fact that labour was polling so low amongst voters this time round was because of him and this was not a state secret. He knew. But he refuse to step down and do the right thing. If this was really about the good of the country he‚Äôd have seen that maybe we could have won with a leader that was not him. 

He was a weak leader of the opposition, and only seemed to really stand up to the tories right when it came down to the wire. 

He didn‚Äôt have a concrete position on Brexit so people didn‚Äôt know whether to vote for him or not. 

Whilst I was all for the majority of the manifesto, I think he just came across like he was throwing shit against the wall and seeing what would stick. 
I absolutely don‚Äôt agree with the idea of state owned pharmaceuticals, and I thought the free broadband thing came across as disingenuous. People are scared when they are promised too much at first. It makes them distrustful. But he can‚Äôt see that. He says he takes responsibility but then ends up still blaming the media. 

And though I am not 100% convinced that he‚Äôs a terrorist supporter or anti semite I feel there are a lot of things that show that he‚Äôs got some interesting views.  

I voted for Corbyn in spite of this because I loathe the tories and deeply believe in building a fairer society. But Corbyn isn‚Äôt the man to do this."
