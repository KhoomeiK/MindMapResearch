For example, if user testing reveals that the majority of testers expect a specific button to be red and in the top right corner of the screen, then that's where it goes. I'm obviously wrong, so how do you interpret  research to get a multitude of answers?"

Personally, using the term ""design"" within the UX world doesn't make much sense to me.  UX is about logic, ease of use, rules of thumb, simplicity, user testing, etc. You can have an absolutely hideous interface that works perfectly.

Seems like UX Researcher is a more apt title."

He's hiding under the couch now, but he's probably still feeling quite stressed because it's a high traffic area. Set up a cozy spot where he can feel hidden away – a little-used room if possible. Put his food and water near his hiding spot. Put his litterbox in the same area as the hiding spot, but away from his food/water. Make his new spot a cat heaven.

Visit him frequently there. Talk to him gently and make every interaction positive. Sit with him,  speak gently to him, give him treats, toys, etc. Most cats LOVE string, so try playing with him with a shoelace or something similar.

Be patient. He'll come around soon enough."

• Play with your kitten A LOT. The more you play with them, the more they'll bond with you. If your cat suddenly seems stressed when playing, you may have accidentally frightened it. Stop what you were doing and speak to them gently.

• They need a variety of toys. Wand toys tend to be a hit with almost every cat, but kittens like playing with almost anything, so feel free to experiment. 

• Give them high-quality cat food and change its water daily. 

• Adult cats, when they aren't playing, love to be peaceful, cozy and relaxed. Give them lots of nice places to sleep. 

• Cats need multiple places to sharpen their claws. Some prefer horizontal scratchers, some prefer vertical.

• Watch Jackson Galaxy videos."
