However you should look into IOP programs, you‚Äôll get group therapy, be able to quickly change your meds, and see a therapist + psychiatrist every week.

Apparently the #1 killer for people with bipolar disorder is heart disease. I read up on some articles and it‚Äôs been proven that there is comorbidity between bipolar disorder and heart disease. Our brains process stress in a way that  contributes to electrical pulses to the heart being disregulated, leading to heart disease.

I take a beta blocker twice a day to lower my blood pressure and heart rate.

To meet new people maybe you should try volunteering or joining a spiritual group. It takes a lot of the pressure and anxiety off of meeting new people when there‚Äôs another reason as to why you all are gathering.
Your life isn‚Äôt over. If this is rock bottom for you the only place to go is up. Things will get better but you have to put in some work first. I wish you the best :)"
bipolar,ezp8z6z,t1_ezp82gu,1568035747.0,"I was on strattera 40mg for a couple of months. It kind of put a blanket on all of my desires to experience what previously brought me pleasure. This was amazing because I finally stopped binge eating and my appetite was suppressed which allowed me to lose weight. However I slowly started turning into a robot, especially during depressive episodes. I didn‚Äôt really have a sex drive + stopped hanging out with my friends  + stopped eating."
BipolarReddit,ezlx0wq,t3_d1hddy,1567982863.0,"Congrats on University, if you haven‚Äôt already you should look into contacting your disability office they can give you accommodations! 

I‚Äôm also 22, BP1 diagnoses, and I just graduated University a month ago. I also managed to study abroad in Italy & conduct my own research to present at a neuro conference. So shoot for the stars while you‚Äôre there & don‚Äôt let this diagnoses hold you back!

However, I‚Äôm happy & sad that I did this. If I could change anything it would be taking breaks/ semesters off. I graduated on time & the stress of doing so probably made my symptoms worse. I was almost constantly having an episode, been hospitalized twice, and was pretty miserable most of the time bc I wouldn‚Äôt allow myself to take a break. Now that I‚Äôm done this year is dedicated to figuring out my mood & medications before I go abroad again. It‚Äôs going to be a really fucking hard time, especially because of side effects (I already have partial hearing loss because of lithium). So my advice to anyone in this thread is that it‚Äôs okay to take a break!!! I wish I could‚Äôve told this to my past self :/ and it‚Äôs hard to remind myself now."
BipolarReddit,ezlveoc,t3_d1hop0,1567982170.0,Wow yes. I changed around some of my doses since my last hospitalization in November and for the first time today I felt like I was typing when I was typing. That sounds strange but while I was typing I felt like I was fully there. This is the first time I haven‚Äôt been disassociating in almost a year.

BipolarReddit,ezg6ltj,t3_d0wzc7,1567892359.0,I thought I was being ‚Äúborn again‚Äù and every woman in my life was a witch. However I was half witch half angel which allowed me (God) to come to earth in my body. Famous powerful women were also witches and it was their duty to get me to earth safely and protect me throughout the years. I thought life was hard for me in order for them to train me to realize this (I was God). This was all for me to bring Rapture in one year and cleanse the world after my realization ............ yup. Definitely the mania speaking.
BipolarReddit,ezb3gz4,t3_d0imvx,1567812388.0,"I recently just got over a mixed episode and it was absolute hell. I‚Äôve never felt more alone. What did help was that I knew it would pass, even though it seemed like it wouldn‚Äôt while I was in it. I‚Äôve also said I just wanted to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I even told my therapist that I was just seeking to be normal, to be happy. After we broke this concept down and analyzed it, it was apparent that I was seeking euphoria, not happiness. Realizing that showed me I needed to re-evaluate my concept of happiness to help coping with this disorder. Instead of chasing cheap highs of life I should really be focused on stability. 

In regards to work and what people think about you, often times people are more worried about themselves than they are about you. I‚Äôve always avoided having to tell my coworkers anything about my diagnoses by just saying I have an illness and the reason I wasn‚Äôt in was because of a flare up. This isn‚Äôt a lie either. If they want to chat amongst themselves about it then that‚Äôs none of your business, with this diagnoses you should try to learn sooner than later that it doesn‚Äôt matter what people think of you if it has zero impact on your life.

I got diagnosed at 18. I‚Äôve been having episodes since I was 14 & was hospitalized twice in the past 4 years. I‚Äôm currently 22, and I accepted my diagnoses after I got it because if I didn‚Äôt I don‚Äôt know where I could‚Äôve ended up. Of course I‚Äôm not perfect and go without sleep, occasionally drink, and used to smoke a hell of a lot of trees but accepting it has truly made my life easier. Of course it‚Äôs still pretty rough but this way I still have a family & friends."
bipolar,eyv9ve0,t3_cyyyjp,1567485504.0,"Wow thank you so much for this post! Makes me feel a lot less alone. 
There are times where I think I‚Äôm completely straight and then my mood switches and I think I‚Äôm bisexual or gay. Mixed episodes leave me feeling very confused. I often wonder if my sexual orientation changes because I have bipolar disorder. This makes me scared to date because I don‚Äôt want my mood to suddenly change, leading to me no longer finding my SO attractive"
