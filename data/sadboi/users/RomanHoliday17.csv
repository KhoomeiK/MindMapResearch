LSD,eoiuog0,t1_eoitu6r,1558627675.0,"I’m actually only 18, and I tripped 2 times just around the time I had just turned 18. I was on a very low dose of Paxil at the time, only 10 mgs, but now I’m on 40 mgs. I had no idea that LSD depleted serotonin. I was told that LSD didn’t deplete or produce serotonin, just that it changed the way your brain processed it. I don’t plan on tripping anytime soon, but i would like to do it again, because my first trip was so pleasant and mind opening. Both times I tripped, I was told that the tabs were 250-300ug but honestly who knows😬. Yeah, the 12 hours seemed to be years! Time was such a weird concept to me while I was tripping. I believe that maybe my parent’s divorce somehow maybe subconsciously effected my LSD trip and the thoughts I had. A lot of my “amazing thoughts” were about God and learning to forgive people, and how selfish I had been in the past."
