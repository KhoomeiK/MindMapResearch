AmItheAsshole,fr3q5se,t3_gmcc8f,1589863297.0,I was really ready to go in with this post because it sounded so fucked up. But now I firmly believe you're NTA. Who just talks shit like that to someone after lying about a drug issue?
AmItheAsshole,fr3fzre,t1_fr2prvz,1589856599.0,You did that just fine by yourself by lying to your wife all your marriage.
JUSTNOMIL,fqyghdk,t1_fqydzfd,1589748196.0,I'm so happy for you! That's the best success. I'm sorry about your mom though and wish the best for you.
JUSTNOMIL,fqxx85j,t1_fqxepe4,1589739232.0,Thank you so much for your advice. I'm sorry you struggled with your MIL and I hope that part of your life is over.
JUSTNOMIL,fqwwnsk,t1_fqwwkm5,1589719861.0,"She slipped up though! My family is close. If one person knows something, everyone else does too in about 5 minutes. So there's no way it wasn't gonna get back to me!"
JUSTNOMIL,fqwwauj,t1_fqww7rw,1589719561.0,"Oh don't worry, I did! Thank you :)"
JUSTNOMIL,fqwvt4s,t1_fqwtq70,1589719152.0,I had to call some of my family members and explain to them that I do not have a virus and I'm not in quarantine. I already told them that she was making it up for her own shit.
JUSTNOMIL,fqwvp0m,t1_fqwri9l,1589719057.0,If she tries anything ill definitely use it to my advantage! Sometimes her behavior is beyond me.
JUSTNOMIL,fqwvn1x,t1_fqwhodr,1589719009.0,I can only hope. Just need some luck.

Scams,fqwe9fz,t1_fqw9hgx,1589701325.0,Good for him lol! I'm sure he's living the dream.
Scams,fqwe7k2,t1_fqwe29a,1589701273.0,He said he got rid of them eventually after I kept threatening the police. But after all that he left town and I don't have any idea where he is or any of his personal information.
Scams,fqw8czv,t1_fqw805y,1589695801.0,Thats so insane! The world is a small place o swear! Hope you didn't bring him in lol
Scams,fqw71ax,t1_fqw702y,1589694690.0,Just attention mostly. I dunno. Strange guy.
Scams,fqw2gih,t1_fqw283z,1589691006.0,"I was scared at first, but eventually realized I had the upper hand. After that it was fun to scare him back."
Scams,fqw2em2,t1_fqw283z,1589690965.0,"He tried several times to contact me and do it again and each time I would say ""leak them, its child porn AND revenge porn, give me a reason to throw you in prison"". Hes always be like ""stop I was kidding"" and block me, then unblock me and it ended up repeating until he gave up. Hasn't attempted contact in about a year and I was 15 when he took the photos."
JUSTNOMIL,fqw1yhy,t1_fqupi4i,1589690626.0,I'm so sorry that happened to you. I was almost waiting for the same thing to happen to me. I'm glad you got through it though!
JUSTNOMIL,fqw1w93,t1_fqv8pkr,1589690579.0,"I could see how you would think that, except we never mentioned anything about being quarantined and specifically stated my client tested negative. She made it up"
JUSTNOMIL,fqw1t1q,t1_fqvhill,1589690512.0,I don't doubt it.
Scams,fqvuos6,t3_gkz1am,1589685599.0,"I had an old hookup take secret pictures of me, then threaten to leak them if I didn't text him back. I was a minor (idk if you are) and he wasn't, so I told him he was in possession of child porn and encouraged him to leak the photos so I had proof for a court case. I also screenshotted his threats. Do not show them that you're afraid of them, thats what they want. Theyre a lot less likely to leak any photos of you if you don't care that they're leaked, or at least convince them you don't care."
JUSTNOMIL,fqvagki,t1_fqvaeml,1589673150.0,I've already told my family to ignore her and that she's made all that shit up.
JUSTNOMIL,fqv9agy,t1_fqv50ku,1589672467.0,Oh I will. Next time she asks us to go shopping for her she can do it herself since it was so essential for her to get her hair done too.
JUSTNOMIL,fqv97cp,t1_fqv5vhh,1589672416.0,Good luck and stay as safe as you can!
JUSTNOMIL,fqv96mg,t1_fqv44g9,1589672404.0,What the hell?? You'd think people would be more sympathetic to diseases..
JUSTNOMIL,fqv8z4k,t1_fqv3lcb,1589672288.0,Is it wrong that I truly wouldn't be too bothered? Its so harsh but convincing my family I could be dying is nuts.
JUSTNOMIL,fqv31u9,t1_fqv1dn0,1589668874.0,No of course not! She also pretended to have the virus last week.
JUSTNOMIL,fquvk2g,t1_fqumzxe,1589665203.0,I did apologize to my family for her drama. They all know now that she's absolutely nuts.
JUSTNOMIL,fquvih6,t1_fquo1rr,1589665184.0,You're absolutely right. SO agreed on couples counseling to set proper boundaries.
JUSTNOMIL,fqulo30,t1_fqul21c,1589660900.0,"Sucks for them, at this point. My family thought I could be dying. Info diet starts NOW!"
JUSTNOMIL,fqulk8a,t1_fqulapr,1589660855.0,"I am very afraid that if she keeps crossing boundaries like this that it could very negatively affect our relationship. Talking about my MIL with SO has proven to be difficult, unfortunately. I'm not willing to give up on SO though, because I know his mom is very manipulative. Therapy is a go!"
JUSTNOMIL,fqulbe3,t1_fqukf0z,1589660746.0,"I've never heard of those therapy types before, I will definitely look into it. It's become very frustrating now that my family got involved and they thought I was sick. It has spread more than I wouldve liked it to and its time to set boundaries. Thank you for bringing those to me, ill check it out!"
JUSTNOMIL,fquhun9,t1_fquhj3q,1589659209.0,I've contacted my family about it and explained it all to them. Told SO that info diet starts now and will never end. I'm aggravated to say the least. Thank you for your input!!
JUSTNOMIL,fqugpfv,t1_fqugnnh,1589658696.0,Thank you so much!
JUSTNOMIL,fqug7z1,t1_fqug3i4,1589658448.0,It 1000% doesn't. This will be our blockade from now on.
JUSTNOMIL,fqug5o3,t1_fqug1s9,1589658412.0,Thank you! I about lost my head today.
JUSTNOMIL,fqufwx6,t1_fqufpo7,1589658270.0,Thank you for the kudos. I'm just furious right now.
JUSTNOMIL,fqufuzv,t1_fqufpo7,1589658239.0,"This was my final straw. To tell my family I possibly have a very deadly disease when NO ONE told her that, it's done. I'm done with it. Ive listened to every excuse and defense in the book but I made it clear after this that the info diet starts now and never ends. To both MIL and FIL. This scared my family about my life."
JUSTNOMIL,fquf2g7,t1_fquez9y,1589657777.0,Let's also add that when she told my family she was at the hair salon my cousin works at getting her hair done. So she's not to concerned.
JUSTNOMIL,fquebcu,t1_fqudzt9,1589657346.0,"At this point, yes. SO has agreed to not speak about anything medical any longer with anyone in the family. I dont believe he told her all the shit she said. She probably twisted it herself because its who she is, but if this is where its going to go then I'm not letting FIL know anything at all either."
AmItheAsshole,fqudcuy,t1_fqt6yms,1589656797.0,"Agreed. I dont think they have the legal right to shut off someone's water, and could possibly be sued."
JUSTNOMIL,fqud5k6,t1_fqucvmy,1589656681.0,I've already spoken with my family and told them that none of what she said is the case. This woman aggravates me more than any other person I've ever met.
teenagers,fq8e14x,t1_fq8dupu,1589164081.0,Sounds just like you if you ask me. You both have shit to work on. You attack people online as well.
teenagers,fq8dh1o,t1_fq8d5w3,1589163717.0,"You know, you really act badly to people and then wonder why people aren't exactly fond of you. Are you the same in real life as you are online?"
teenagers,fq8chmg,t1_fq8c1ak,1589163089.0,"You're asking your mother to buy you like $1000 worth of equipment just because. Also, it's Mother's Day. What did YOU do for HER? You need to start appreciating what you have."
FML,fq8brmj,t1_fq7tmf6,1589162626.0,From what I read he's a young adult. He can take responsibility for his own actions.
FML,fq5skja,t1_fq57no6,1589116310.0,"I didn't, but I believe that if he harasses people and holds misogymistic views, he's not as innocent as he's letting on."
JUSTNOMIL,fq4pfce,t1_fq224n8,1589081121.0,"SO has thankfully agreed that she will absolutely not be allowed unsupervised visits. If it were up to me, LO would have no visits with her at all."
FML,fq4oga4,t1_fq4nyfz,1589080495.0,You can downvote me but your comment history genuinely suggests that you hold some misogynistic views.
FML,fq4nyfz,t3_ggprn8,1589080200.0,"I mean, you do have a history of harassing people on reddit for something as simple as a disagreement, so I can only imagine you're similar in real life. You don't seem like a very nice person based on your comment history"
relationship_advice,fpwa2l8,t3_gftwx0,1588959839.0,"I know a lot of the posts on this subreddit have automatic ""break up with him"" comments, but this is one thats necessary. Break up with him."
JUSTNOMIL,fpuknu8,t3_ges59p,1588915439.0,Sorry I have not been responding to comments. Life with SO just got rough. Will be back soon to respond but I am taking some time off for now.
JUSTNOMIL,fproeyy,t1_fpqppsb,1588858840.0,I will definitely speak to my counselor about it. Thank you for your advice!
JUSTNOMIL,fpro8mq,t1_fpqlk61,1588858734.0,"If it comes to lawyers, I would be pretty upset. We've got a plan in place for the most part."

JUSTNOMIL,fppyrqu,t1_fppwq3z,1588811767.0,"Ohhh okay I understand. I thought you were saying she would try to kill me and I was like ""damn it's really like that?"""
JUSTNOMIL,fppyo2u,t1_fppxeym,1588811710.0,Just gonna ignore this one. Thanks though
JUSTNOMIL,fppvfp9,t1_fppv8rd,1588809923.0,Well that was a sudden turn. Can you explain a bit better?
JUSTNOMIL,fppv1vk,t1_fppoxbt,1588809715.0,I've never thought about a will but it has been mentioned twice so I think its a good idea.
JUSTNOMIL,fppuyxv,t1_fppqje9,1588809669.0,"I've been thinking about it for a while honestly. This is gonna be a conversation that I really will not like to have, but is definitely necessary"
JUSTNOMIL,fppuvnp,t1_fpprhky,1588809618.0,"He is not, no. Thats a good point, truly."
JUSTNOMIL,fpput1k,t1_fpps7b7,1588809579.0,I'm starting to see that now.. it makes me sad but it has some truth to it.
JUSTNOMIL,fppurtr,t1_fpprkzu,1588809559.0,"I never thought about it that way, I see that for sure. Getting that to SO will be a different story though :/ there's no grandparents rights here unless he dies or we lose custody (excluding adoption) so we are covered there."
JUSTNOMIL,fppum64,t1_fppsn6v,1588809472.0,I have talked about this with SO and I don't think he would do that. However we have a full set of security cameras outside the house so I'd know either way.
JUSTNOMIL,fppnz6g,t1_fppnr3t,1588805826.0,"That's good! Seriously, that was none of her business"
JUSTNOMIL,fppnatc,t1_fppn8bf,1588805466.0,I hope that was stopped. I would really lose my head

JUSTNOMIL,fppm5n7,t1_fpply9e,1588804845.0,Haha no kidding! Suing people is damn near in her blood.
JUSTNOMIL,fppl0uc,t1_fpph89n,1588804240.0,I couldn't deal with losing my child. Especially to this MIL Monster. Goddamn... I'm really gonna have to put a cap on this.
JUSTNOMIL,fppkw09,t1_fpph8d6,1588804167.0,"I will take a look, thank you for your help!"
JUSTNOMIL,fppktlt,t1_fppichd,1588804132.0,"She's become more impossible to deal with as time has gone on. I hate that she pretends to be this loving wonderful mother because she's truly mean and hateful to me and has been to SO as well. She's caused tension in my relationship on purpose, I do NOT trust her with my hypothetical child."
JUSTNOMIL,fppknra,t1_fppiqv8,1588804044.0,That doesn't apply where I'm from unless SO and I get a divorce or he dies. Otherwise there's no right to grandparents rights here. Thank fuck.
JUSTNOMIL,fppkcwp,t1_fppihn7,1588803884.0,"Ooooo a password, thats good!! I'll definitely implement one during hospital stays/appointments/records. Thank you! And I'm sorry you have to deal with this as well."
JUSTNOMIL,fppk7jw,t1_fppk4j7,1588803803.0,"That's very true, it is his responsibility"
JUSTNOMIL,fppgjip,t1_fppgduh,1588801865.0,I agree. I'll do some research for sure and let you know if I end up with any questions.
JUSTNOMIL,fppfsgk,t1_fppfhv8,1588801479.0,"Oh wow, thank you! I may take you up on the offer, its definitely a struggle to understand."
JUSTNOMIL,fppdiqj,t1_fppdgek,1588800313.0,Thank you tons! I agree with you 1000%.
JUSTNOMIL,fppd850,t1_fppczre,1588800162.0,"The doctor hasn't told HER (because people with munchausen turn that into a whole ordeal apparently), but the doctor did tell SO and JYFIL. I do not want her having any contact, but its a discussion SO and I will need to have."
JUSTNOMIL,fppcvah,t1_fppcj0v,1588799980.0,"I was the one who said she wasn't allowed in the home. I make it very much my space (and for SO too of course, but hes not too into interior design lol) and I don't want her to judge it (which she's done before). Info diet for sure! Pray for me, haha!"
JUSTNOMIL,fppcpsi,t1_fppcj5f,1588799902.0,"Those are good, thank you!"
JUSTNOMIL,fppc4df,t1_fppbrrx,1588799596.0,Thank you lots! And yes. She's a total control freak. I wouldn't put it past her for sure.
JUSTNOMIL,fppc1hd,t1_fppbkgr,1588799556.0,"Thank you tons for your help, ill try to use this in my talk with SO"
JUSTNOMIL,fppb9p2,t1_fppb0hw,1588799165.0,"I can't say much about the CPS call other than that there was one. I dont know too much info about it. But she calls CPS, animal control, and the police. Its a miracle she hasn't yet, but it seems she's playing ""good mom"" for now. Shit drives me insane."
JUSTNOMIL,fppb2jc,t1_fppatc0,1588799063.0,"I have made it clear that he is the only one allowed to come to appointments with me, and my mother is the only outside person allowed in the delivery room (she's helped deliver children and is an RN, which he agrees is a good idea). We also agreed that we are taking 6 weeks with no visitors from either side of the family, but the full pregnancy along with after that 6 weeks is gonna be a real killer. Just hoping for the best at this point."
JUSTNOMIL,fppatm8,t1_fppaev3,1588798936.0,"A strict info diet is probably our way to go. I dont want to punish (if you will) him for his wife being a nut. He knows it, but he's also very depressed and with her threats, its no wonder he feels stuck."
JUSTNOMIL,fppakcj,t1_fppael0,1588798808.0,"He's dealt with her for so long that it's very hard to discuss his MIL with him. It's his ""normal"" but I'm trying to express that it isn't mine, and I'm terrified of bringing a baby around his MIL. She has called CPS on SO's brother before."
JUSTNOMIL,fppaete,t1_fpp9zxc,1588798731.0,"Just might have to do that. I just can't imagine handing our baby over to her to hold; it gives me the shivers. I can quite literally hear her pestering me about EVERYTHING. Weight, height, how much hair he has, facial structure, mental capacity, all of it."
JUSTNOMIL,fppa3q8,t1_fpp9vt9,1588798577.0,"Thats a good perspective. I'll definitely need to discuss it with SO and see what he thinks. I agree fully with you, but getting SO to agree to that is what will be the killer here. We both love FIL, but I've also got some strict expectations for my future children."
JUSTNOMIL,fpp9wrp,t1_fpp9jtk,1588798479.0,"SO has told his mother that I flat out said she's not allowed in our house, so we've burnt that bridge at least, lol. Info diet is a great idea, I'll talk about that with SO tonight. SO thinks she's harmless in that extent but I wouldn't put it past her to show up and do everything we would tell her not to. I have had zero contact since we moved out and have been a much happier person since, so planning on keeping it that way."
JUSTNOMIL,fpp9i5a,t1_fpp8vh7,1588798276.0,"Its not that he would choose not to have a relationship with the baby, its that my MIL is a nutcase and threatens a divorce with a lawsuit if he does things she doesn't like, which would include seeing a baby that she's not allowed to see. We've definitely made it clear to him that we would love for him to be involved, it'll just be difficult if we go no contact with JNMIL. I'm already NC but she calls SO every single day to gush about how proud of him she is and how she loves him soooo much! Irritates the shit out of me because before he moved out he was a lazy piece of shit to her."
AmItheAsshole,fplj3h0,t3_ge2hgf,1588713621.0,YTA- You are NOT pregnant. She is. You don't get to assume anything about her pregnancy and her ability to handle things. Get off your ass and help with your kids while she cooks dinner. Not that hard.

trump,fpdr4b3,t1_fpdqti5,1588532543.0,So is Donald Trump.
trump,fpdinia,t1_fpdfcm8,1588527736.0,So you first claimed you believe Juanita. Now you're claiming that because she has no evidence that it didn't happen. So do you think Bill Clinton raped her or not?
trump,fpdhk5c,t1_fpdgjpk,1588527120.0,Explain to me how a police report is evidence and how taking an abuser to court for their abuse is not. They're reporting in the same way. What determines the credibility for each woman? Your political standing? Because Juanita did not have proof and you believed her. These women went to court and you don't believe them.
