I had tmj until late 2018 after which i started popping one cod liver oil capsule per day(requested by me to be prescribed by my doctor)

I also left veganism and went ham on animal foods, I still ate veggies, but only ones my stomach can tolerate. I love salads to this day and eat them almost daily. I also enjoy fruits (for their high citrus and vitamin c) regularly. 

But I always make sure to eat one meal with fatty animal foods, emphasis on fatty foods cooked in sunflower seed oil and soaked in butter😂😂

Ive not had any issues with my tmj so far. I hope you ask a Doctor to prescribe you a low inflammatory diet.

Maybe find a study partner to help stay focused. Or maybe inform a parent to monitor your progress to help you.

Study Smart! I used to bring out old question papers to find what topics are asked repeatedly in tests to cut down my study time.

I managed to pass tests despite studying last minute. I was a big MD procrastinator hhaha

Its okay you took a mini vacation by MDing in your Alternate Universe. Now time to focus on your current universe hahaha!😁😁😁"

Thats definately a sign of a bad diet if he gets stuffy after eating! Sounds like leaky gut if he has developed food intolerance to things he didn't have before in life.

 Reccommend him r/keto or r/ketoscience. If he is on reddit that is!

Definately helped me get rid of the problem he has. 

Sorry to change wind and take over your rant. Its quite frustrating when people are careless with sickness. Especially if its unknown cause!"

This can be avoided to an extent by big corporation companies by allowing employees to work from home or providing special protection gear to people working in banks or grocery stores!"

If you have bacterial infection, best remedy is some good spicy chicken soup(pre cooked packaged that only requires heating) and some butter and boiled eggs. Good sleep and some good entertainment.

Don't stress your body too much, wish you a speedy recovery!"
rant,fixtj6w,t3_fafsbc,1582826453.0," I think he has to go to a G.I. doc cuz that sounds like he has parasites! This is just my guess from my own personal experience.

not tryna scare you, parasites, they probably eat all the food he eats so he dosent gain weight! 😓😓

I totally understand your frustration my dude. I would be disgusted too. I was like that aswell, sniffing and swallowing my snot all day, I also didnt gain weight despite my massive appetite, turns out I had liver flukes. 😕"
