Anxiety,fpsw095,t3_gf9j2x,1588880560.0,"Firstly bloody well done for doing a presentation, itâ€™s my biggest fear! Iâ€™m so sure you were better than you think, itâ€™s just anxiety making you feel otherwise!

Iâ€™ve been working a lot on my anxiety (through cbt) and the main thing for me is acceptance. Itâ€™s hard and I havenâ€™t mastered it at all but itâ€™s about accepting that weâ€™re not perfect cos no one is, and also accepting our anxiety instead of fighting it.

I think that allowing yourself to feel anxiety somehow takes away its power. So if you say to yourself, ok, for the next half hour Iâ€™m only going to think about that presentation, your anxiety might ease up a bit. 

I like writing so my therapist gives me lots of writing tasks. The main one right now is spending 15 minutes a day writing about a time I failed. How did I feel at the time, how did I feel looking back, what went wrong, what did I learn etc. Itâ€™s really hard! So maybe you could try this. Another thing she got me to do is write a list of all my worries and then reframe them in a more positive way.

I hope this helps a little."

I wondered if maybe Iâ€™m in an ok mindset so Iâ€™m labelling the feeling as excitement rather than anxiety, physically the two feel quite similar itâ€™s really just the thoughts and/or situation that decide which it is."
benzorecovery,fpfjctd,t3_gd4sdl,1588573023.0,"This time round I am.

The head zaps/deja vu have calmed down a lot now and I kinda miss them, they added a bit of excitement to the day. 

I have intense nostalgia, remembering all this stuff from my past as clear as if Iâ€™m in the moment of it. 

My emotions are swinging between excited and anxious, excited and bored, excited and paranoid, I guess itâ€™s sort of like a pendulum and will eventually settle out. 

At first I was kind of freaked out but now Iâ€™m just enjoying it. As I type this Iâ€™m starting to wonder about the quality of what I was taking as it wasnâ€™t from a doctor just online stuff but it feels just like all the other times Iâ€™ve gone off of them, I think my mindest is just a bit better."
