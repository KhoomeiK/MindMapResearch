Good/Bad 
Throw away the concept of, “good” and “bad”/“right” and “wrong” when referring to yourself, or your situation, or your behavior. Don’t even ever use the words. They cause us to judge everything we do in a moral way and we then end up hating ourselves because of all the “bad” or “wrong” things we do, and how we judge ourselves so harshly and we think of ourselves as failures with character faults. That leads us to all sorts of ideation and over thinking, anxiety, etc. because our analytical mind won’t let it go. Instead, look at your thoughts, actions, moods, etc. as “healthy” or “unhealthy”. Those words are morally neutral. You can then look at something objectively, and adjudge it as one or the other, and then rationally begin to take steps to diminish unhealthy behaviors and increase healthier ones without the crippling self loathing.

Try practicing mindfulness. What happens is that your analytical mind tries to fix hurtful past situations or predict future disasters. You’ve heard of overthinking something...this is that. The analytical mind gets going like an out of control time machine flying back and forth with you inside of it. It’s a churning river of regrets, anxiety, guilt, self hate, shame, self harm, suicidal ideation, all the things that we struggle with. It bates us to jump in and we do without even realizing it. We’re carried away to all of those unhealthy emotions, and we begin to drown. This is where practicing keeping your mind in the present is so important. Google ACT, (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy). Developed within a coherent theoretical and philosophical framework, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a unique empirically based psychological intervention that uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies, together with commitment and behavior change strategies, to increase psychological flexibility. Among other things, you learn diffusion, the ability to observe your thoughts without being ruled by them. You should find a lot of great tutorials. This is why bipolars are so busy with art, song, writing, musical instruments, building, crafts, etc. They keep us in the present concentrating on what’s going on in the moment.

So if we’re depressed, or hypomanic, the brain wants us to feel good, so it sends out chemical signals to get us to do things that made us feel good in the past, even though it didn’t help our depression or anything else in the long run. That’s where so many unhealthy coping mechanisms come from, drugs, drink, porn, hypersexuality, shopping, overeating, spending too much time playing games or scrolling the internet, etc. They mask the real problem in the short term by causing the feelgood chemicals to flow. When it passes we condemn ourselves because we’ve been so apparently weak. The thing to do is to begin to strengthen the mind over the brain. Get it more and more into the driving seat. There are a number of ways to do this.

Two ways I’ve used are:

A) to go out for a run (warm up and then stretch lots first) and in the beginning, when your brain is sensing that this is uncomfortable and begins to send out pain signals to try to get you to stop, tell the brain to take a back seat, that you’re going to keep running anyway. After a little bit the brain will see that you are not really injuring yourself and will begin to kick out the dopamine etc. This begins to train your mind to make your brain help you to feel better in a healthy way.

B) When I’m depressed, I do the same thing when my brain is telling me not to do anything, I tell it to take a backseat and stick to my daily routine. Again once I get moving, I begin to feel better because my brain then gets with the program and begins to help me feel better.

If you’re ever suffering from eating urges, (or any other overwhelming urges, this can be adapted to so many things), set an alarm for a half hour later, setting out a healthy snack that isn’t too much so the brain can see it, and get used to that being what is coming up. Go about your business until the alarm sounds and then slowly eat the snack, in each of these steps the brain will get to eat, satisfying it’s desires, but it has to bend to your will to do so. Again, you’re strengthening the mind over the brain. This puts you in the driving seat. Anytime you feel what seems to be an uncontrollable urge to do something unhealthy, don’t get bated into following it, instead tell the brain to take a backseat and do something the mind tells you is a healthier alternative. ❤️"

How Marijuana Use Complicates Bipolar Disorder

People with bipolar disorder abuse marijuana more than any other drug. Some are trying to self-medicate their bipolar symptoms. Medical marijuana isn’t an approved method for treating bipolar disorder in states where medical cannabis is legal. The combination of marijuana and bipolar disorder can make an already difficult mental illness worse. Research shows about 70% of people with bipolar disorder use marijuana. Around 30% of those people meet the diagnostic criteria for cannabis use disorder. Some studies suggest the effects of marijuana abuse may even lead to bipolar symptoms.

The effects of marijuana and bipolar disorder can contribute to several complications:

Worsened Mood Issues and Psychosis

Cannabis can intensify the depressive or manic episodes of bipolar disorder. Marijuana acts on some of the same brain chemicals and functions that play a role in psychotic symptoms. These include dopamine, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate transmission. Some researchers believe this is how cannabis abuse worsens or causes new bipolar symptoms. They recommend it not be used to treat bipolar disorder.
A meta-analysis of several studies on marijuana and bipolar disorder confirms cannabis use in bipolar disorder worsens symptoms of the mental illness. Marijuana use may increase the risk of new manic symptoms by as much as three times in people with bipolar disorder. Other research by the University of Manchester shows an increase in both manic episodes and depressive episodes. Study participants saw a 17% increase in bipolar depression symptoms. They also saw a 20% increase in manic symptoms after using marijuana.

Causes Faster and More Frequent Bipolar Symptoms

Bipolar disorder is marked by a “cycling” between extreme moods of depression and mania. Things like brain chemical fluctuations and people’s biological make-up contribute to the onset of these cycles. Cannabis abuse may lead to “rapid cycling” in people with bipolar disorder. Rapid cycling in bipolar disorder is four or more distinct affective states (i.e., depression or manic episodes) within a one-year period. One study followed 144 people with bipolar I disorder. The researchers found that people with bipolar who used cannabis experienced more cycling than those who didn’t use cannabis.

Increases Risk of Co-Occurring Disorders

Effects of marijuana and bipolar disorder increases the risk for other co-occurring behavioral health issues. One study examined data from a national survey on substance abuse and related conditions. Over 1,900 people with bipolar disorder and cannabis use disorder were represented in the sample. The researchers found marijuana and bipolar disorder can significantly increase the risk for:
* Alcohol dependence
* Drug addiction
* Antisocial personality disorder
* Nicotine dependence

Triggers Bipolar Symptoms in People With Certain Genes

There could be such a thing as cannabis-induced bipolar disorder. Research shows marijuana abuse may trigger psychotic conditions like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in people with certain genes. Specifically, cannabis abusers with a variation of the AKT1 gene are at increased risk for psychotic disorders. The AKT1 gene is involved in dopamine signaling in the brain. Systems that regulate dopamine are thought to play a role in bipolar disorder symptoms. Cannabis users with this gene variation who smoke marijuana daily are seven times more likely to develop psychosis than people who don’t use cannabis. Moderate marijuana users are two times more likely to develop psychosis.

Increases the Risk of Suicide

Marijuana and bipolar disorder can be a deadly mix. People with bipolar disorder are at a heightened risk for suicide already. Cannabis use may further increase this risk. Depressive episodes can feel bleak in people with the disorder. The extreme highs and lows can be exhausting and debilitating. Abuse of drugs like marijuana may add to depression and hopelessness. Treating bipolar disorder with medical marijuana can be dangerous. A 2015 study published in Neural Plasticity found 42% of bipolar study participants who used marijuana had attempted suicide.

Makes Treatment More Complex

Bipolar disorder is a complicated disease with various biological and environmental components. Getting the right dose of mood stabilizers and finding which behavioral therapies work best for each individual is complex. Cannabis abuse makes this treatment challenge even more difficult. One study followed people with bipolar disorder who used cannabis over one year of dual diagnosis treatment. Compared to non-cannabis users they had:
* Less adherence to treatment plans
* More severe mania and psychosis
* Less overall life satisfaction
These are symptoms that typically improve in bipolar patients receiving treatment who aren’t abusing marijuana.

A Silver Lining

The good news is that many people with a bipolar diagnosis do get better. Using marijuana for bipolar disorder is not the answer though. Medical cannabis can dull symptoms for a while, but usually backfires. Bipolar is a lifelong illness. Patients with bipolar disorder require specialized bipolar treatment. It’s possible to improve symptoms with prescription drugs, behavioral therapy and a healthy lifestyle that doesn’t include substance abuse. Like all psychiatric disorders, managing mental health conditions is key."

6. Comorbidities and severity

Several studies have demonstrated the close association between tinnitus and comorbid psychological disorders (Adoga et al, 2008; Harter et al., 2004; Reynolds et al., 2004; Londero et al., 2006) showing that tinnitus causes distresses leading to deterioration in psychological well being and hampering the daily life enjoyment of affected individuals. There could also be a reversal in this relationship with increase in tinnitus severity during periods of poor psychological well being (Rauschecker et al., 2010). Therefore this association can be said to be dual. A population study has reported that emotional exhaustion is a strong predictor of tinnitus severity which indicates the degree to which an affected individual is worried, bothered or angry about the tinnitus (Hebert et al., 2012) with the severity of tinnitus depending on these comorbid psychological disorders.

Some researchers group tinnitus severity into the following; help-seekers, non-help-seekers; complainers and non-complainers (Attias et al., 1995; Hallberg et al., 1993). Others classify tinnitus severity into three subgroups based on the predictive factors for incapacitating tinnitus and these are: audiological tinnitus, somatic tinnitus and depression and anxiety related tinnitus with the latter group being the largest subgroup (Holgers et al., 2000).

The neurophysiologic model explains the severity of tinnitus to be a conditioned response focusing on the network of neural activity in the auditory system, the sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous systems and the limbic system (Jastreboff & Hazel, 1993).

Some of the psychological disorders associated with tinnitus are anxiety, depressive disorders, hysteria, insomnia, anger, fear and despair. Researchers have found associations between tinnitus and anxiety disorders (Shargorodsky et al., 2010) and depression (Krog et al., 2010). However, patients with tinnitus and depression may not meet the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (Shargorodsky et al., 2010). Patients with tinnitus and comorbid anxiety and depressive disorder often present with exaggerated symptoms or non-tolerance of tinnitus. The clinical manifestations which may be seen in these patients are highlighted below.

Type of symptom and Manifestations

1. Increased arousal	 Restlessness, increased startle response, disturbance with sleep;
2. Mood	  Fearfulness, apprehension, worries, irritability;
3. Thoughts	 Unrealistic appraisal of danger, belief in inability to cope, fear of impending death or a sinister background illness for the tinnitus;
4. Behaviour  Constriction of purposeful activities, avoidance;
5. Overactivity of autonomic nervous system	 Tachycardia, hot and cold flushes, dry mouth, diarrhoea, urinary frequency, sweating;
6. Somatization	 Sense of retrosternal constriction, hyperventilation, faintness, muscular tension, fatigue, pain, tremor.

Manifestations of anxiety disorder

Type of symptom and Manifestations

1. Loss of interest	Inescapable sadness, loss of capacity for enjoyment or interest in previously pleasurable activities;
2. Loss of energy	Staying indoors and avoidance of social interactions, inactivity with degeneration in physique, strength and physical well being;
3. Biologic symptoms	Change in appetite and weight, disturbance of sleep and loss of libido;
4. Disorders of thought content	 Feeling of guilt, worthlessness, hopelessness;
5. Psychomotor agitation	Incoherent conversation, expansive gesturing, pacing and hair twirling;
6. Psychomotor retardation	Slow speech, coordination and impaired articulation;
7. Others	delusions, depersonalization, derealization, obsessive-compulsive phenomena.

Manifestations of depressive disorders

Researchers have also found out a strong association between hearing loss (which is a strong predictor of tinnitus) and mental illnesses (Hebert et al., 2012; Dalton et al., 2003). Hearing loss reduces an individual’s ability to communicate with people and this can worsen a mental health disorder like anxiety and depression. Tinnitus severity ratings also strongly correlate with levels of psychological distress indicating that tinnitus may worsen mental illnesses (Fagelson, 2007; Henry et al., 2007; Mrena et al., 2002). Anxiety and depression often increase in patients with tinnitus suggesting that tinnitus and these mental illnesses may affect similar neuronal mechanisms in the central nervous system which affect attention, emotions and perception (Fagelson, 2007; Henry et al., 2007)."

How Marijuana Use Complicates Bipolar Disorder

People with bipolar disorder abuse marijuana more than any other drug. Some are trying to self-medicate their bipolar symptoms. Medical marijuana isn’t an approved method for treating bipolar disorder in states where medical cannabis is legal. The combination of marijuana and bipolar disorder can make an already difficult mental illness worse. Research shows about 70% of people with bipolar disorder use marijuana. Around 30% of those people meet the diagnostic criteria for cannabis use disorder. Some studies suggest the effects of marijuana abuse may even lead to bipolar symptoms.

The effects of marijuana and bipolar disorder can contribute to several complications:

Worsened Mood Issues and Psychosis

Cannabis can intensify the depressive or manic episodes of bipolar disorder. Marijuana acts on some of the same brain chemicals and functions that play a role in psychotic symptoms. These include dopamine, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate transmission. Some researchers believe this is how cannabis abuse worsens or causes new bipolar symptoms. They recommend it not be used to treat bipolar disorder.
A meta-analysis of several studies on marijuana and bipolar disorder confirms cannabis use in bipolar disorder worsens symptoms of the mental illness. Marijuana use may increase the risk of new manic symptoms by as much as three times in people with bipolar disorder. Other research by the University of Manchester shows an increase in both manic episodes and depressive episodes. Study participants saw a 17% increase in bipolar depression symptoms. They also saw a 20% increase in manic symptoms after using marijuana.

Causes Faster and More Frequent Bipolar Symptoms

Bipolar disorder is marked by a “cycling” between extreme moods of depression and mania. Things like brain chemical fluctuations and people’s biological make-up contribute to the onset of these cycles. Cannabis abuse may lead to “rapid cycling” in people with bipolar disorder. Rapid cycling in bipolar disorder is four or more distinct affective states (i.e., depression or manic episodes) within a one-year period. One study followed 144 people with bipolar I disorder. The researchers found that people with bipolar who used cannabis experienced more cycling than those who didn’t use cannabis.

Increases Risk of Co-Occurring Disorders

Effects of marijuana and bipolar disorder increases the risk for other co-occurring behavioral health issues. One study examined data from a national survey on substance abuse and related conditions. Over 1,900 people with bipolar disorder and cannabis use disorder were represented in the sample. The researchers found marijuana and bipolar disorder can significantly increase the risk for:

That leads us to all sorts of ideation and over thinking, anxiety, etc. because our analytical mind won’t let it go. Instead, look at your thoughts, actions, moods, etc. as “healthy” or “unhealthy”.

Your brain is just an organ. It has no sense of healthy or unhealthy choices, that’s in our minds where we’ve developed whatever sense of morality we have. So if we’re depressed, or hypomanic, the brain wants us to feel good, so it sends out chemical signals to get us to do things that made us feel good in the past, even though it didn’t help our depression or anything else in the long run. That’s where so many unhealthy coping mechanisms come from, drugs, drink, porn, hypersexuality, shopping, overeating, spending too much time playing games or scrolling the internet, etc. They mask the real problem in the short term by causing the feelgood chemicals to flow. When it passes we condemn ourselves because we’ve been so apparently weak. The thing to do is to begin to strengthen the mind over the brain. Get it more and more into the driving seat. There are a number of ways to do this.

Two ways I’ve used are:

A) to go out for a run (warm up and then stretch lots first) and in the beginning, when your brain is sensing that this is uncomfortable and begins to send out pain signals to try to get you to stop, tell the brain to take a back seat, that you’re going to keep running anyway. After a little bit the brain will see that you are not really injuring yourself and will begin to kick out the dopamine etc. This begins to train your mind to make your brain help you to feel better in a healthy way.

B) When I’m depressed, I do the same thing when my brain is telling me not to do anything, I tell it to take a backseat and stick to my daily routine. Again once I get moving, I begin to feel better because my brain then gets with the program and begins to help me feel better.

If you’re ever suffering from eating urges, (or any other overwhelming urges, this can be adapted to so many things), set an alarm for a half hour later, setting out a healthy snack that isn’t too much so the brain can see it, and get used to that being what is coming up. Go about your business until the alarm sounds and then slowly eat the snack, in each of these steps the brain will get to eat satisfying it’s desires but it has to bend to your will to do so. Again, you’re strengthening the mind over the brain. This puts you in the driving seat. Anytime you feel what seems to be an uncontrollable urge to do something unhealthy, don’t get bated into following it, instead tell the brain to take a backseat and do something the mind tells you is a healthier alternative. 

Throw away the concept of, “good” and “bad”/“right” and “wrong” when referring to yourself, or your situation, or your behavior. Don’t even ever use the words.

If you’re ever suffering from eating urges, (or any other overwhelming urges, this can be adapted to so many things), set an alarm for a half hour later, setting out a healthy snack that isn’t too much so the brain can see it, and get used to that being what is coming up. Go about your business until the alarm sounds and then slowly eat the snack, in each of these steps the brain will get to eat satisfying it’s desires but it has to bend to your will to do so. Again, you’re strengthening the mind over the brain. This puts you in the driving seat. Anytime you feel what seems to be an uncontrollable urge to do something unhealthy, don’t get bated into following it, instead tell the brain to take a backseat and do something the mind tells you is a healthier alternative. 

Also, throw away the concept of, “good” and “bad”/“right” and “wrong” when referring to yourself, or your situation, or your behavior. Don’t even ever use the words. They cause us to judge everything we do in a moral way and we then end up hating ourselves because of all the “bad” or “wrong” things we do, and how we judge ourselves so harshly and we think of ourselves as failures with character faults. That leads us to all sorts of ideation and over thinking, anxiety, etc. because our analytical mind won’t let it go. Instead, look at your thoughts, actions, moods, etc. as “healthy” or “unhealthy”. Those words are morally neutral. You can then look at something objectively, and adjudge it as one or the other, and then rationally begin to take steps to diminish unhealthy behaviors and increase healthier ones without the crippling self loathing.

And finally, try practicing mindfulness. What happens is that your analytical mind tries to fix hurtful past situations or predict future disasters. You’ve heard of overthinking something...this is that. The analytical mind gets going like an out of control time machine flying back and forth with you inside of it. It’s a churning river of regrets, anxiety, guilt, self hate, shame, self harm, suicidal ideation, all the things that we struggle with. It bates us to jump in and we do without even realizing it. We’re carried away to all of those unhealthy emotions, and we begin to drown. This is where practicing keeping your mind in the present is so important. Google ACT, (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy). Developed within a coherent theoretical and philosophical framework, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a unique empirically based psychological intervention that uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies, together with commitment and behavior change strategies, to increase psychological flexibility. Among other things, you learn diffusion, the ability to observe your thoughts without being ruled by them. You should find a lot of great tutorials. This is why bipolars are so busy with art, song, writing, musical instruments, building, crafts, etc. They keep us in the present concentrating on what’s going on in the moment. ❤️"

It’s helpful to also eliminate your common triggers from your life to keep that from happening."

It has no sense of healthy or unhealthy choices, that’s in our minds where we’ve developed whatever sense of morality we have. So if we’re depressed, or hypomanic, the brain wants us to feel good, so it sends out chemical signals to get us to do things that made us feel good in the past, even though it didn’t help our depression or anything else in the long run. That’s where so many unhealthy coping mechanisms come from, drugs, drink, smoking, porn, hypersexuality, shopping, overeating, spending too much time playing games or scrolling the internet, etc. They mask the real problem in the short term by causing the feelgood chemicals to flow. When it passes we condemn ourselves because we’ve been so apparently weak. The thing to do is to begin to strengthen the mind over the brain. Get it more and more into the driving seat. There are a number of ways to do this.

Two ways I’ve used are:

A) to go out for a run (warm up and then stretch lots first) and in the beginning, when your brain is sensing that this is uncomfortable and begins to send out pain signals to try to get you to stop, tell the brain to take a back seat, that you’re going to keep running anyway.

He was the creator of the Coca-Cola Santa Clause. He drank heavily and would come into his studio in the evening after being out on the town, drunk, and proceed to fire his entire staff. When they wouldn’t show up the next day, he’d call them and ask where the hell they were...why weren’t they at work. They’d say that he fired them the night before. He’d roar into the phone, “I fire you every night! Get the hell down here!” They of course were used to it and they didn’t take it personally. They knew that it was part of working with and learning from one of the great illustrators of all time. So if you’re cool with this being a part of your relationship with her, and not taking it personally, nor seriously, well, there you are.

Look at the great writers, musicians, painters, actors, comics, computer programmers, jewelers, etc. and you will see a great many tortured souls producing these great works. So there is the added creativity of a mind that just works so much faster than a ‘normal’ one. The benefit in pursuing a creative outlet is that, A) you have something you can look upon as a success, and accomplishment to help carry you through the rough times. And, B) a creative outlet keeps your mind centered in the present, practicing mindfulness, because creativity is problem solving and requires your concentration in the here and now. So it’s not so much what you create, as that you create.
