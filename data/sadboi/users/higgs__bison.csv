I like their sunscreens because I break out from coconut derived ingredients, and my face cannot handle chemical sunscreens at all (I break out in rashes ugh). Cotz's sunscreens are 100% mineral, coconut free (some, not all), and suit my sensitive skin. They're also heavily silicone based, which works well under makeup. Plus, their sunscreens are reef-friendly which is just \*chef's kiss\*.

Edit: Unfortunately Cotz is not verified to be cruelty free like I had previously thought, so please ignore this!"

There's a ton of info there regarding the different kind of cups available, how to insert them, etc. and it's really helped me in my transition away from single use, disposable options. I was originally using a MeLuna cup for ~4 years, but wanted something that was softer and with a different shape more suited for my anatomy. With the info from [/r/menstrualcups](https://www.reddit.com/r/menstrualcups/) and [Put a Cup In It](https://putacupinit.com/), I found a more comfortable cup that is significantly cheaper than some other options on the market (Lena Sensitive Cup in Small for $24.90, if you're curious). I also combine it with some period panties I got on sale from Thinx, and my periods (which are super heavy and painful due to PCOS) are so much easier to deal with. 

Menstrual cups are not for everyone, but I highly encourage people to check them out, especially if you want to save money in the long run or are interested in sustainability."

It's pretty straightforward: you have a video chat with a doctor or nurse for 15 or so minutes, talk about the state of your skin and how you would like to improve it, they prescribe you a medication, and then  they send the prescription to the pharmacy of your choice. They can also mail the prescription to you, but I thought it was kind of expensive. The only cost to use the service is for the video  appointment, which is ~$25 if I remember correctly; if you're not satisfied, they'll give you a refund."

AmItheAsshole,fnef02c,t1_fne595c,1586888189.0,"Based on what OP has written, and based on my own experience, OP's partner has crossed a boundary in their relationship, moving from a healthy relationship into an unhealthy one. 

Firstly, OP's boyfriend has manipulated her parents to such an extent that they are convinced that OP is the sole problem (as evident by the mom's reaction), which is just not realistic: a single person can't be at fault for everything in a relationship. The fact that OP's parents believe that OP is consistently at fault, and the boyfriend has no responsibility, is troubling. 

Secondly, OP already feels like she is unable to talk to her parents and voice her side of an argument; this phase is known as isolation, which is another step in the abuser's subconscious plan to control. 

When OP's partner feels like OP has been successfully broken down and unable to express herself freely, and retain a support system, it becomes easier for the partner to abuse her emotionally, mentally, physically, etc. because they are aware that she will be unable to ""escape"" or fight back. Again, based on what OP has written, it seems like her boyfriend is already emotionally abusing her by 1) failing to acknowledge the boundary he's crossed, 2) failing to apologize, and 3) ignoring the issue instead of working with OP to develop a solution. This is why I suggested OP should run: the abuse has already started escalating.

We often learn of the abuse a person is suffering from at the hands of their partner when it is often too late; we question as to why the victim did not leave earlier, why didn't they seek out help beforehand. The answer is that abuse starts out small and seemingly inconsequential, and over time, becomes worse until the victim's perception is completely skewed, and they are unable to differentiate a toxic relationship from a healthy one.

The book I suggested is a great tool which goes into these issues further; it does have ""men"" in the title, but the contents of the book are gender neutral, and it acknowledges that anyone can be an abuser or a victim. If you have any other questions or need further clarification, let me know."
AmItheAsshole,fne3hfl,t1_fnd5oog,1586882396.0,"This, 100%. OP please read ""Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men"" which details common abuse tactics implemented in relationships. Charming family members/friends and then isolating the victim is incredibly common, as it makes it difficult for the victim to seek out help when the abuse escalates: the victim is often afraid their loved ones won't believe them when they seek out help regarding their partner's abuse because ""their partner is just so nice, there's no way they could be an abuser!"", so the victim withdraws from their loved ones and continues to suffer.

My ex abused me for 9 years and this was one of the main factors as to why I didn't leave earlier. He financially supported me and was so funny and nice in public, people thought (and continue to think) he's a great guy. Behind closed doors, he mentally, emotionally, financially, and physically abused me. Run, this is a red flag."

I also have pretty dry and sensitive skin, and I've been looking for a cleansing oil that doesn't have any citrus oils, fragrance, or ingredients in it which I know break me out, for a *very* long time. I came across the BFD cleansing oil, and it seems like a pretty good option for my skin. 

However, it has juniper oil in it, which beautypedia says is not great in the long run because it's essentially a fragrance and can be sensitizing? I was just wondering if you find the fragrance to be overwhelming, or if it irritates your eyes at all?"

I've been living abroad in Germany for the past few years, and I'll be returning to the US soon without health insurance.  I'm trying to navigate the US healthcare system in preparation for my return and it's terrifying how expensive everything is, so telemedicine services seem to be my only option. I've been looking into Lemonaid specifically because it seems to be the only one available in the state I'll be moving to, and I was apprehensive about using it because the reviews are few and far between. Based on your review and experience with the app, though, it sounds like a more trustworthy and viable option than I had originally perceived it to be! 

Thank you again for the response and your kindness! You've eased a lot of my worries, and I hope your future interactions with your doctor will be better than your past one!!"

bipolar,f0xbc0b,t1_f0uucqe,1569027378.0,"Hey! I'm sorry for the delayed response.

I understand how you feel. It's been hard to manage a hormonal disorder and a mental illness, especially when it comes to fertility. My previous psychiatrist refused to treat me for bipolar disorder because of my already reduced fertility and the risk of taking medications regarding my ability to conceive and maintain a viable pregnancy; he said I should wait to get treatment until I've had kids. I told him on five separate occasions I don't want kids and I never will, and I wanted to start trying medications now. I then said that even if I did change my mind about having children, there are other paths to parenthood besides giving birth, which I would be more willing to pursue anyway as my first choice in starting a family, such as adoption. I stopped going to him after he angrily lashed out at me: he said he knew I would change my mind about giving birth to children, and I should wait 10 years before starting treatment. 

I tried to confide in my friends and then partner about the situation and how misogynistic my psychiatrist was, and they all sympathized with my doctor and told me I should be patient and wait a few years. It blew my mind. I asked them if they honestly thought I should suffer and wait 10 years just in case I might change my mind. They were all pretty quiet after that. Their response made me feel less than human, like all I am to them is a baby-making machine. I know that's not the case, but it was still hurtful.

I'm sorry for the pain you're going through. As I said in my previous comment, I'm more than happy to talk or just listen if you want support."
bipolar,f0utiqm,t3_d6o51b,1568950288.0,"I totally empathize. 

I was diagnosed at 27 (now 28) during my last year of my master's degree and right before starting my PhD, and it's really taken a toll on me. I've tried multiple medications but none have worked out thus far. The medications either cause the worst insomnia or disrupt my working memory, which impacts my ability to study and work on my thesis. And if the medication does start to have a positive impact on my mental well-being, I've had to stop it because it affects my hormone levels thanks to comorbid PCOS. 

This whole situation has been awful. I've had to put off finishing my degree, my partner of 9 years left me because I was too much for them, and I don't feel like myself anymore. 
I don't really know what to say because I'm in a pretty low place at the moment, but I feel like I'm starting to have more good days than bad by consistently reaching out to my support system when in need, being open with my psychiatrist, and keeping myself busy. 

I know I'll eventually push through this, and I know you will, too. I hope there is some comfort in knowing you're not alone on this journey. I'm more than happy to listen to you and provide support if you want to talk to someone without any judgement."

SkincareAddiction,ex0udji,t3_cqs51p,1565922443.0,"I see some recommendations regarding cystic acne in general, but I thought I would offer my perspective since your acne is in the EXACT same location as the cystic acne I used to have (on the side of the nose and close to the nostril). I also tried everything to get rid of my acne, including tretinoin, spironolactone, antibiotics, etc. It would temporarily go away, but it would always come back as soon as I'd stop my treatment.

After not taking any prescribed medications for a while, I eventually realized that my cystic acne would improve when I would sleep on my back, and it would worsen when I’d sleep on my side (as well as in the summer when I would sweat the most). I did some research into this and came across acne mechanica, which is acne that comes about from friction and pressure. Acne mechanica is usually due to wearing tight athletic clothing that traps sweat and oils against the skin, blocking your pores. Your pores then become irritated from the pressure and friction of the clothing rubbing against the skin, causing breakouts. In my case, acne mechanica developed because whilst sleeping on my side, I would really press my face into the pillow, pushing my cheek towards my nose so that the [skin on the interior cheek area close to my nose would ""fold"" against itself and against my nose.](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/40de7b_02aeaa72671d448cb70d609c4f6573d7~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_451,h_675,al_c,lg_1,q_80/Kimsmushedfacebranded.webp) Sweat and oils would get trapped in this ""fold"" and block my pores. The skin on either side of the “fold” would rub against itself as I moved about in my sleep at night, irritating any blocked pores and causing the development of painful cystic acne next to my nose and around my nostrils.

I dealt with it by training myself to sleep on my back, as well as applying 5% benzoyl peroxide to the area to clear up and prevent any new acne from forming as I became accustomed to my new sleeping position. Once I started sleeping on my back every night (not just regularly), my acne went away in about two or three weeks. If you sleep on your side at all, I would suggest changing your sleeping position first!  Hope this helps, and best of luck."
