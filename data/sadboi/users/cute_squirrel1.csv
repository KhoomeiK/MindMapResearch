For me, I begin to realize more and more that anxiety is all about focus. You focus on a sensation and you think the world is going to end.

When I'm working on a personal project and my focus is 100% on that thing I'm doing, I don't even realize the sensations are there.

It's like you're hyperfocused on something and you judge it as a threat. Then it becomes a vicious cycle.

You have to try and get out of your own head. Learn to listen to your body again. I know it's hard when you have anxiety but it's doable. You can do a body scan for example.

You can practice relaxing / sleeping during the day. Just take 30 minutes to relax and try get some sleep. During the day you have less pressure and more likely to fall asleep.

Your insomnia won't kill you. Yes, insomnia can have negative consequences on a long term basis. But we are talking very long term here. You have no heart problems so you are not at risk at all.

The body can cope with 4 hours or less sleep for extended periods of time. It's just doesn't work as good when it's sleep deprived.

Next, practice yourself in acceptance. You have to stop trying to control every thing. Your body is a miracle but you have to trust in it. And listen to it. It will tell you when it's tired and when it needs rest. But you have to let it do its job. Don't interfere too much. Have trust in your body!!!"

Meditation,fn2iied,t1_fn1ex7j,1586590253.0,"You can ask yourself: do you want to be happy?

True happiness comes when you experience the present moment as complete or fulfilling. You feel light and relaxed.

Most people think that it's external factors that we need for that. Which is partly true. However, many people in today's world do have all the conditions for happiness and are still not happy.

Because they are stuck in the past or the present. They are stuck in imaginary situations in their head. This is blocking the ability to experience the present moment fully and realize that you have already more than enough to be happy.

Stopping means to stop searching for things. Stop chasing happiness. Chances are it's already there.

Stop expecting external conditions to make you happy. Look inside.

The key is to realize that it is the chasing, the running, the restlessness, and ultimately our inability to understand that were already where we need to be, is what causes us suffering.

There is nothing wrong with having goals. And sure, their fulfillment can give you a peaceful mind. But the journey is so much more important than that."
Meditation,fn2i3y1,t1_fn2hsov,1586589827.0,"I think what we have to do is we have to decide if we want to be happy or not. Or at least try. That is the first important step.

Then we have to understand that happiness is only possible if we are 100% in the present moment. Holding on to good and bad moments of the past will cause us suffering. Your mind simply goes into a completely different level of consciousness when you're totally present vs when you're dwelling on the past. If you're in the past, there is no room for experiencing the beauty and completeness of the present moment.

We should not try to control our minds too much. It will always go back to the past. It's because we trained it to do that and maybe partly because of genetics. So don't beat yourself. Have an anchor in the present. The breath, the body, sensations. Those are always in the now. Everything else is just images."

Meditation,fn2grcz,t1_fn25snj,1586588435.0,"Hi there,

Apologies for what you had to go through.

Of course my post is a bid of an exaggeration. Depending on what you deal with you can't ""just"" let go in a matter of seconds. You can pretend to but you would just lie at yourself.

If there is a high amount of trauma involved I don't think it is possible to achieve a completly peaceful mind.

Say a mother who lost her family in a car accident. I am not going to tell her just to let it go. The trauma is just too much. Maybe, with years of psychotherapy she can reach a state of mind which allows her to get proper restful sleep again. To function in this world. And maybe to find somebody new again. To expect that she can live in peace and let everything go would be an insult.

I had some trauma to deal with myself.

After months and years of meditating and digging, to understand what's going on, I am able to mostly leave it behind and live the present moment without too much influenced of the past.

The biggest problem we have as humans is that the perception of the present moment is determined by our experiences in the past. If we can learn to let go, we can somewhat return again to peaceful present moment."
Meditation,fn13ccj,t1_fn133qr,1586553962.0,It sounds counterintuitive to many people. But is so so true.

Meditation,fn0mrkl,t1_fn0lfxp,1586544814.0,"Let me explain more clearly. Letting go and stopping doesn't  mean to do nothing.

Let's say you're weak and want to pick up 405 pounds. Of course you have to invest a lot of work to get there. You have to train hard, you have to eat well, you have to rest and sleep well. Plus, you need some balancing activities to not burn out.

Let's focus on the resting and sleeping part. When does muscle grow and get stronger? Right, when you rest / sleep. In order to rest and sleep well you have to feel peace with where you are at right now.

So finding peace with where you are right now is super important. And therefore it is important to learn how to stop.

As mentioned, stopping doesn't mean you should stay weak and skinny. Stopping means to accept the present moment with everything that belongs to it.

Please take my post with a grain of salt.

There are no 5 minute fixes in this world.

If people are traumatized it takes a lot of work. To understand. To find solutions. And finally to get better.

I myself had to go thru years to dig around in my childhood and my parents and find out why I am suffering so much. It involves effort, honesty and tears.

However, letting go and acceptance is at the core of many solutions. These solutions may not always free you from your grief and trauma. But they may certainly reduce your suffering."

Letting go is often interpreted as doing nothing. Which... Is somehow what it is.

However, you can also incorporate letting go into action.

Let's say you have to do the dishes.

Some people do the dishes and some people do the dishes wanting to be somewhere completely different. They are stressed, hurrying and cannot wait to be done with the dishes.

In that scenario we can let go of not wanting to do the dishes. We can surrender to it. Because that's part of our life.

But I agree with what you say. People also have to do something in order to advance in life, meet people, have a family...."
Meditation,fmzqexi,t1_fmzpmuh,1586527317.0,"Agree. Letting go is contextual. Of course we have to take action to function in this world.

Some people eat their lunch and some people eat their lunch.

Do you get my point?

Some people are just shoveling their food in and some people are actually in contact with their food

Other example, dieting. Let's say you have a normal weight but want to eat more healthy to become fitter and what not.

Some people just eat a healthier diet. And some people eat a healthier diet being so utterly obsessed about nutritional value of the food they're eating. This obsessive thinking can make people sick. It's called orthorexia.

Nothing wrong with eating a healthy diet. But we should be aware that our knowledge and thoughts of the food we're eating also has a tremendous impact on our well being.

Meditation,fmzinz5,t1_fmzia56,1586521587.0,"I believe in your power to overcome your fear.

I would recommend to first dig deeper to understand where it's coming from. Then it will be easy to let go of it.

For example, some time ago I was afraid to leave the house. Didn't know why. Turns out I was grieving something that happened in the past. But I wasn't aware of it. As soon as I realized that my body went into full relaxation mode and I never was afraid to leave the house again ever since.

In my experience, a lot of anxiety comes from unawareness and connected to it a lack of presence. A major reason for anxiety is also pretending to feel a certain way while deep down you are feeling a totally different way. Like you cannot express your feelings fully.

Expression is very important.

So as soon as you are aware of why you're feeling a certain way, you can let go. Without understanding, it's hard. I've tried that all the time. But I was just lying at myself."

Meditation,fmz92nt,t1_fmz8n13,1586511237.0,"I know what you mean.

Control gives us a certain kind of comfort and safety. It makes us feel like we're doing something about the problem, whatever it may be. In our modern society it is counter intuitive to do nothing.

Nowadays, we are doing sooo much stuff, and we are sooo connected. Even when we think we're doing nothing, we're still hyperactive. Thinking, dwelling on the past, anxious, comparing, doubting, controlling...

I begin to realize more and more that it's best to just let go. That it's best to just surrender. Almost as if you're dying before you actually die. Paradoxically, that's where life begins.

Life is not control. Life is accepting the good and the bad and going with the flow.

To work on that, you don't necessarily have to expose yourself to situations.

I would even say that continuous exposure is rather harmful as it exposes you to stress. You collect negative experiences and your mind thinks skmething must be wrong. DANGER!

Instead, you should use the time now to work out more why exactly you feel so stressed in social situations. 

What is it that makes you afraid? What is it that makes you tense up? Are you too much trying to control life? Remember, you have no control over life. What motivation do you have to finally solve your problem? And ask yourself what impact your thoughts, beliefs and emotions have on your well being. Should you believe every thought that comes in your mind to be true? Your thoughts and emotions create your reality. And most thoughts are negative and have nothing to do with reality.

What happens when you experience fear or anxiety and allow it to get in your head, you tense up.

Especially with fear there are certain areas in the body that tense up. Specifically, the belly, the neck, the jaw, the shoulders.

Just imagine what a turtle is doing if it's scared. Right, pulls its head into its shell so it is protected. It's doing that because the head is the most vulnerable part of the body. Same with us humans. When we experience fear and we are convinced that we die (as sometimes happening in a panic attack) we want to protect the most vulnerable part of our body. The head.

What likely happened to you is that the muscles in your head, neck, jaw, etc are so tight from all the tension that they cannot relax anymore.

How do you release this tension? 

First, breath. Deeply. Your brain and muscles need oxygen to become lose again. Don't just meditate. Breath deeply!! It's the only way to get rid of the tension.

Second, do some stretching exercises for your jaw, neck, shoulders and massage the muscles in your face. Especially your forehead, cheeks etc.

Third, drink more water. This is to ensure that all the tensed up tissue in your body gets lose and flexible again.

Once you've done all that, your headache and anxiety should be gone.

Now comes the important part:

Once the tension and headache is gone you will feel different. It might even feel uncomfortable. Almost vulnerable.

At this point you have to learn to let go from the tension. When fearful thoughts or anxiety comes up, learn to let it go. Don't clench your jaw, don't tense up your neck. Just let it go. Breath! Focus on the present. Let it go. Direct the energy through other parts of your body. Let it flow. You are safe.

Once your realize that you're safe. That you don't have to tense your head, neck, etc. You can learn to let go more and direct your focus onto more important things.

Hope this helps :)

Edit: this is also connected to the fatigue. Most of the energy goes into tensing up the muscles in your face and thinking fearful thoughts. Let say you spend 95% of your energy in holding muscle tension in your head. The energy cannot flow freely anymore. No wonder you have no energy left for other stuff. Trust me, I've been there :)

Learn to let go. Dance. Scream. Just let it flow :)

Edit 2: Same with Tinnitus. If my jaw is really tight I get Tinnitus all the time. It's all connected. Same if you feel dizzy, that's just because your neck is tight.

Edit 3: Ultimately, meditation is good to make you more aware of your thought process. So you can learn to experience the moment and when fearful thoughts come up, be able to intervene.
