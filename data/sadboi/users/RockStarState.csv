Parents make jokes about loving their kids and getting frustrated with them still, does anyone *ever* go on there and talk about how they were nervous about not having kids and instead are happy they didn't? No! If parents joke about wishing they hadnt had children you dont see anyone talking about how boomers are pressured into having kids by the media. 

Because it's weird and inappropriate! It is just as weird and inappropriate for you to do the reverse when someone makes a child-free joke.

No matter your thoughts and feelings on the topic it is SO strange and SO inappropriate for you to talk about how you're actually so happy you had kids after being nervous about it when someone makes a joke involving their choice. And then in another comment to the OP you bring up Trump supporters? The fuck?

Not to mention being nervous and unsure if you'll enjoy being a parent is absolutely normal! It doesn't make your experience any different to any potential parent. Being nervous and unsure about a life changing event means you have emotions and that's it, it's not some testament to an entire generations feelings towards having children.

Getting people to accept the abuse is a key ingredient in the abuse, it's how abusers get a long lasting supply of power. They normalize it.

Culture is in food, culture is in traditions and holidays. Culture is in the clothes you wear.

Whether or not she comes to term with that without hurting the rest of her family further is up to her....

And medical professionals have it good, they get protection. I work in a grocery store and people are forced to work because they can't afford not to, they risk their lives because they HAVE to.

If you need help I can help you figure it out, it's one of the reasons the CDC reccomended boxed milk - because it is non perishable. 

If it's more often than every two weeks it is luxury shopping - we are VERY used to it in the US, it's how the industry continues to increase its profit. You need pat milk, almond milk, cashew milk, it's all here at your convienence! Except now, it comes with a price. That price could be your life, the life of a family member, or the life of someone in your building if they forget to wash their hands after touching the same door handle as you.
