But honestly if you had to go through a 5 minute verbal briefing and be told you'd be kicked out if you're behavior wasn't up to snuff you might pay more attention. If info is just written and you sign a release no one reads that shit. Maybe zoos and aquariums could hire some temp workers during the busy season to keep their eyes on people and start kicking people out. I think if people saw they couldn't just be an asshole or let their kids be assholes it might change some behavior.

I think this honestly would be doable. Before you go in you're briefed on expected behavior and kicked out if you don't follow it. Some people are idiots but sometimes there are things people just don't realize they are doing that stress the animals.

insanepeoplefacebook,fmrnkjj,t1_fmpyt5i,1586328866.0,I agree there is a problem that just anyone can own a gun. In so many states it is pretty easy to own one. It is a big responsibility so there should be some hurdles you have to jump through to own one.

Many of our laws vary state to state which is an issue.
insanepeoplefacebook,fmpwhz2,t1_fmlp4du,1586288611.0,"No one said that. They said that you have to pass tests and are supposed to have insurance to drive, but this isn't the case with guns.

And just because one thing causes more deaths doesn't mean we ignore everything else. All sorts of products get recalled because they are a safety hazard. We no longer use lead paint. We can change things and make things safer in multiple areas at once. 

I don't think the whole criminals will get guns despite laws is a reason not to have laws. Criminals also get drugs illegally so let's get rid of all laws about drugs. Actually criminals don't follow laws at all so let's just not have laws. No laws=no criminals. Do you see how this logic is flawed?"

I mean turn on the news and you are hearing about mass shootings quite frequently. If you want stats go to google. Sure guns can be used for sport but their function and what they are designed for is killing. You can use a bunch of skis to build a fence but skis are designed for skiing on snow.
insanepeoplefacebook,fmptsly,t1_fmldzce,1586287201.0,Yes I never understand how people can try and argue that guns aren't designed for killing. They are tools that are designed to kill another human or animal. I agree that if someone has a gun for self-defense they should be prepared to kill. If you just wave your gun around and the person attacking you gets a hold of it then they will likely kill you. Gun owners should be honest about the situation and responsibility they have.
insanepeoplefacebook,fmptisk,t1_fml8q7q,1586287060.0,"Just because you haven't killed anyone with your gun doesn't mean they weren't designed for the purpose of killing.

Yes you would probably want to scare someone if they broke into your home, but if that didn't work then what? You're going to kill them. 

&#x200B;

What other purpose to guns serve? They aren't for gardening, or cooking, or building houses. They are designed to kill and I wish people would be honest about that. That being said just because you own a gun doesn't mean you need to kill with it but let's not pretend they serve some other function."

Also the whole criminals don't follow laws argument doesn't hold up. People say we shouldn't have gun control because criminals will still not follow the law, but by that line of reasoning we shouldn't have any laws cause criminals don't follow them. Plenty of other countries have way tougher gun laws than the US and they don't have the issues that we do here."

He had no intention of doing so they were just playing. I think the boy was only 8 or so. 

Then within the past few years a woman was at Walmart I believe, and her toddler took her gun from her purse.

There are car accidents but they are just that it is rare that someone intentionally kills someone with a car and if they do they don't get to drive because they end up in jail.

KidsAreFuckingStupid,farfwox,t1_fapa85i,1576315584.0,"Yes it is interesting how different kids even in the same family can be. Some kids you tell them once and they are ok with it, some kids will fight you tooth and nail. Never can tell what you'll get with kids."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,farfg9p,t1_fao5bib,1576315504.0,"I agree that if it isn't permanent or really awful damage then sometimes some kids have to learn this way. You can tell them all you want, don't do this or that but sometimes they are stubborn."
insanepeoplefacebook,farevp3,t3_eadyqn,1576315295.0,"I've worked with kids for a long time and yes there are some people who shouldn't be parents. Some people are against gay people having kids but I think that is a stupid opinion for many reason, but one of which is, gay couples aren't going to accidentally get pregnant. They have to go through a process to have kids, wish it was like that for straight couples as well. Kids aren't for everyone, think about whether or not you really want to be a parent."
AskReddit,fare1sj,t3_ea7s41,1576315082.0,"There is a website called Open Culture that all kinds of info on it, hard to explain but look it up. They often have articles on some museum that is now posting their images in a database for free or online classes given by this person or that person that are free as well as other free resources. Website is easily searchable and really is a great website in general. If you are the kind of person who likes watching Jeopardy then you would like Open Culture."
insanepeoplefacebook,farcgs4,t1_faqjuvk,1576314587.0,Facts are that if you are suicidal and have access to weapons you are more likely to kill yourself because guns are pretty effective whereas other methods are less lethal. So people can try with pills etc but they have a much higher failure rate. If you knew someone was severely depressed would you want them to have a gun?

AskReddit,far9uo7,t1_faotedy,1576313623.0,"I am so sorry. Never a good time for death but must be especially hard this time of year when the emphasis is on family. A good friend of mind died maybe 8 or 9 years ago and I was thinking of her while driving in the car and almost started crying. She was so great and I think of her and miss her often. I hope you are able to find some way to cope with your loss. Maybe you could start some new tradition this year that honors your brother, like maybe making a favorite food of his or something."

Just feel like I've always had a low set point and have never felt as happy or joyful as other people. I envy people who have good families, a good group of friends, and are just generally happy. Always wonder what that must be like. Sorry if this bums anyone out. But when I first saw the question this was honestly my first thought of an answer."

They have a genetic disorder where they're body treats their liver like a foreign invader.

I have a friend who is gay and a family member who has brown skin and I remember thinking this man could really hut them. Felt like a combo of having been fired from a job, ending a relationship, and finding out a loved one died all rolled into one. 

&#x200B;

This is why we need to do away with the electoral college. If we believe in democracy it should be one vote equals one vote, not the skewed thing we have now. Also fun fact that I looked up around the election, electoral college members don't have to vote they way the constituency does in around half the states. So even if most vote for candidate A candidate B could still win."

He'll literally call people names. I didn't like the Bushes at all but I don't recall them saying stupidity like Do Nothing Democrats or calling someone ""Sleepy Joe"" or ""Lyin' Ted"". Utterly ridiculous and childish. Hilarious that his wife is supposedly combating bullying. How ironic."

insanepeoplefacebook,far3mu3,t1_faqlqd2,1576311764.0,"There are actually a lot of boomers who are against Trump. My step dad is in his 70s and hates that idiot. He has been to protests, got shot by rubber bullets by the cops at a Trump rally in AZ prior to the election, and has stood alone holding a giant sign saying things like No Wall and that sort of thing. He does what he can within his scope to change things and has always been politically active. 

I think it is unfair to pin Trump supporters as being one age, I've seen plenty of 20 somethings who support him, which in my mind is even scarier, since with the internet they've had exposure to the world at large and a variety of ideas for a long time. For some this challenge that there is more than one way of thinking seems to make them even more narrow minded."
