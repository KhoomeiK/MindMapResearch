If you’re eager to advance things I’d recommend journaling like crazy and doing workbooks, and reading up on trauma too if that helps you.

We do process specific memories sometimes but that’s if it comes up for me in the present in between sessions- flashbacks nightmares or whatever. Recently we’ve been doing “emotional channel” work on how I subconsciously perceive anger fear etc. and investigating how I generally feel at different points in my life- 4,8,16, and process through those emotions in seemingly “neutral” memories.

You’re just starting! Talk to your therapist about this, you may just be dissociating. My therapist strikes a good balance between leading and guiding. When I started EMDR I was already dissociated 24/7, and it took a couple of weeks to feel grounded and safe and to enjoy the EMDR recovery journey instead of drowning in memories."

CPTSD,f65b1ar,t1_f654tmn,1572700680.0,"Thanks for the reply, I think for me the problem is trying to explain to the people around me that recovery isn’t linear- I can have an awesome social high functioning week, and can then be very depressed and hermity for a weekend. I have a lot of guilt and shame around having to constantly clarify “where I’m at this week” when invited places, and then just want to tell everyone that they’re not obliged to be my friend anymore now that I have cptsd- they signed up for the old fun me.

By metabolism you mean weight I assume? I mean, mental health problems just obliterated my physical health. 3 months before my first panic attack I climbed Kilimanjaro and ran pretty much every day. Now I’m 3 stone heavier. I’m not sure if there’s a direct physiological effect, for me it started when I was finishing my PhD and was less active , under-active thyroid for me is a trauma response and definitely contributed. But I genuinely think it’s just a steady decline in activity due to processing trauma. I started EMDR in May and was very agoraphobic for a couple of weeks, so it’s more the indirect effect of cptsd I’ve found.
