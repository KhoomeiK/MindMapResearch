In fact I travelled to London myself two years to watch Milan vs arsenal and arsenal vs watford for the first game after the cojones match and people respected me and I made friends in London that were surprised at How much I knew about arsenal and football. 

I also feel I'm allowed to play Millwall on FM and career mode while still being  an Arsenal fan. FM is fun while using challenging teams and I'm allowed to go to a game while im visiting London for the first time as a 21 yr old.

In my book he gets a pass. Purely based on acceptable recent form and the fact that he’s a proven hothead (proven in past and even with salah penalty at anfield). What else can we expect of him in that position if we’re being honest. 

We played well. We need some wins in a row starting soon if we’re going to be sending a message to the rest of the league and the Europa league."
