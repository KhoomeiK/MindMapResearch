BPD,fmxmwk1,t1_fmr1avg,1586467981.0,"abilify is the only medication i’ve been on for my BPD that i feel has impacted me in a good way.  i’ve been on prozac which was ass and made me feel sick and numb a lot, zoloft which increased my suicidal tendencies and i actually overdosed on zoloft, ended up in the hospital throwing up and hearing and seeing things that weren’t there which was the worst experience i’ve ever had.  wellbutrin sr was okay but when they switched me to wellbutrin xl it made me so angry and violent i was lashing out real bad over stupid shit.  abilify was the main medication that really worked for me but ofc i’m a dumb bitch and stopped going to therapy and taking my meds once i ran out 🤷🏼‍♀️
thinking of going back to therapy and getting back on my abilify.  in my experience antidepressants haven’t worked as well as my mood stabilizer has...maybe one day i will find the right combination for me.."

BPD,fmxfwfo,t3_fgh8zj,1586464231.0,"i haven’t ever read something that describes me and what i go through daily so clearly.  it feels like some fucked up rollercoaster of being stable and then wanting to die over shit you know shouldn’t hurt you that bad but it does but as you stated, you just can’t stop.  i really felt the whole changing your hair and your style.  it’s hard to express yourself if you don’t know who you are.  i’ve bounced around a lot lately from impulsive hair dyeing and cutting and style changes because i’m going thru a really rough time right now and can’t stop and have no healthy ways of coping with the emotional damage and stress and chaos in my brain."
MakeupLounge,fkleqov,t3_fj7y3s,1584304739.0,"for my face i used: maybelline primer in the blurring effect, neutrogena green liquid color corrector (cus acne!) then i used fenty beauty foundation in the shade 105 (LOVE THIS BTW) and i set the foundation with the covergirl powder foundation in the shade natural ivory.  for contour i used my ABH contour kit powder in the shade light and for blush i used the benefits galifornia blush and for highlight i used jeffree stars highlighter in the shade Peach goddess.  

for my brows i used my ABH dipbrow pomade in the shade medium IIRC, and i used the LA colors concealer in the shade 02 i believe to clean up my brows.  

for my lips i used my NYX lipstick mixed with my ABH liquid lipstick , i don’t quite remember the shades i will have to find out later.  

for my eyes i used my new hudabeauty eyeshadow palette, i used the shades karma, libra, off balance, mercury, hot mess, supernova, haze , utopia and super moon.  i used my stila mascara and some 8$ lashes from walmart (don’t remember the name of them but they came in a set of five or six)"

Legitpiercing,fbcc5rf,t1_fbcbjfx,1576720554.0,"honestly, not sure.  i downsized from 18g to 20g and had no issues personally, but i’d talk to your piercer about it just to be safe.  typically in my experience i haven’t had issues jumping a few sizes when i’m jumping down but if you’re stretching any piercing definitely DO NOT skip sizes or stretch too soon or you’ll risk a blowout.  your piercer should be able to answer any questions about your new piercing.  best of luck!"
Legitpiercing,fbcbaio,t1_fbcb2ss,1576720002.0,definitely wait 6 months preferable longer to begin downsizing.  it’s a fresh wound and messing with it or changing the jewelry will irritate it and could end up closing up or getting infected.  do as your piercer instructed for aftercare and LITHA.  there will be plenty of time to downsize safely down the road :)
