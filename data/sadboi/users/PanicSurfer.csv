He is COMPLETELY detached from reality and regular people. He doesn’t live in a bubble, he lives in an impenetrable iron dome. It’s so grating. It’s cool that he came from humble means, but it’s been so long since he’s been in that world that it’s like he’s from a different planet.

This pandemic has laid bare the absolute stupidity, selfishness, and arrogance of a huge percentage of the population. And I'm starting to notice things I've never really noticed before. People, in general, are so fucking stupid that they are hardly worth saving. 

Virtually nobody around me wears a mask. My own grandparents go out for totally inane things almost every day. One of my best friends, a person who I consider to be intelligent and sensitive, has been out almost EVERY SINGLE DAY since this started because he doesn't like being cooped up in his house. 

He lives with his boyfriend in a very expensive, very large house. It's a mansion by my standards. I've been cooped up in my small apartment, and while it can be a little tiresome, I've been just fine. It's not some huge trial. 

Then, after paying more attention to people, I realized that none of this should come as a surprise. 

I live next to a small lake with some trails around it. I've noticed that a huge percentage of people riding bikes aren't wearing helmets. I've seen multiple parents with their little kids feeding ducks white bread LITERALLY NEXT TO A SIGN ASKING PEOPLE NOT TO FEED THE DUCKS. LIKE LITERAL FUCKING FEET FROM THE FUCKING SIGN. And, again, everywhere I go, mask-wearers are in the minority.

There's a huge population of selfish, stupid, ignorant, useless fucks just waddling around with high opinions of themselves, thinking they're special and invincible. This virus has just made them much more obvious to me. Maybe being cooped up has taken its toll, because I have darker thoughts that creep in when I see how clear the skies are, or pictures of cleaner oceans and smogless city skylines. Not darker thoughts like I'm going to hurt anybody. In fact, I wear masks when I go out specifically to protect these dumbfuck mouthbreathers in case I'm an asymptomatic spreader. 

But I have days when I think the world would be so much better if humanity faced an actual apocalypse. I'm sure I'd be one of the casualties of this apocalypse. I'm a city dweller with no notable survival skills. So, from a micro level, I don't want to die, I don't want my family and friends to die. Even the ones who have proven themselves to be ignorant and selfish during this crisis. 

It's just hard to argue with a sky that's a more crisp shade of blue than I've ever seen in my life.

But I want to reopen RIGHT. When I go out for essentials or to walk my dog, I still see so few people wearing masks, and of those that are, many are wearing them incorrectly (just covering their mouth and not their nose, for example). Testing in Texas has been a joke, and it’s been shown again and again that wide-net testing is the first step in getting on top of this thing. I want widely available and FREE antibody testing. 

Without all of those things improving, why reopen? We’re just going to have to shut down again once we hit a second and even worse peak. The numbers look decent as far as available hospital beds/ventilators/etc. in large part BECAUSE of social distancing. 

It’s such a failure of leadership. People like Abbott don’t want to shutdown, but also don’t want to put in the work necessary to make reopening safer. It’s like none of the necessary steps have been taken. 

Either pay us for shutting down our businesses/jobs, or give everybody antibody tests/masks/etc and reasonable guidelines for a partial reopening. Anything short of that is just lazy leadership."

Now Trump has access to better, earlier, and more rigorous information than any of us plebs though government intelligence channels. He disbanded both the White House pandemic response team as well as a CDC pandemic response team stationed IN CHINA. 

The whole reason we have to shut down, and will probably continue to be shut down, is because of the sloppy, late, and embarrassing response of the government to a very obvious threat. The options weren’t do nothing or shut down. There’s a ton of space in between the two, and now Trump and fanbois like you are whining about the consequences of a shutdown that could have been mitigated or shortened by a robust initial response effort.

This pandemic could have been heavily mitigated by aggressive interventions back in late January, with wide-net testing, contact tracing, encouraging good habits and ubiquitous mask use. There was a way to handle this without nuking the economy.

But that didn’t happen. So there’s no good options here. I’m as horrified of the economic fallout as I am of the virus itself, but we simply can’t allow our hospitals to become overrun and this thing to spread unchecked. There was another way, but that’s over now. This is what it takes and it fucking sucks.

At first, there were a lot of things I didn’t like about Eternal, but that all changed on my second play through. The game actually feels even more DOOM-y to me than 2016, in the sense that the pacing and overall feel of the game reminds me of DOOM II on ‘roids. 

Rip and tear, then explore, find secrets, keys, collectibles. You’ve got an obscenely huge arsenal at your disposal, no reloads, you can move unrealistically fast. It feels very much like a DOOM game to me.

It’s still up in the air as to how bad this can get, and how history will remember it. But if you still think this is like a regular seasonal flu, you’re not firing on all cylinders."
politics,fkt8028,t3_fk6n9l,1584509118.0,"Oh, give me a fucking break. 

I showed up for sanders. I’m 28. 

Anecdotal, but I know tons of people in my age range who are sanders “supporters”, but just didn’t show up. They could have. There was two weeks of early voting. It took me 5 minutes. 

We can cry and bitch and moan all we want, but the basic fact remains the same. Sanders lost to Biden by *millions* of votes. Young people just don’t fucking show up. Period. Full stop. 

It’s time to stop with the excuses. It’s so cringe."

But, just so you’re caught up, thousands have already died, ya goober. Check up on Italy. That’s us in a few short weeks, because of denialism. If you’re *still* comparing this to the seasonal flu, you’re simply uneducated on the subject."

Coronavirus,fkt1z3s,t3_fka9x7,1584504020.0,"Yeah...

I’m a self-employed house-call dog groomer. My work involves going into many different peoples houses/apartments every day. 

I made the choice to cancel all my appointments for the next two weeks, especially after reading about how many people are asymptomatic spreaders. Many of my clients are vulnerable. 

About half of them had cancelled anyway. 

Luckily, I have a fairly substantial savings. But it’s still terrifying because who the hell knows how long this will last? If my clients all have to tighten their belt, they aren’t going to be hiring any luxury services like in-home dog grooming. 

Fuuuuck. 

We’ll see another corporate bailout for the travel industry, and by 2021 we’ll be cannibalizing our neighbors in the streets. Fun times ahead."
Coronavirus,fksba6s,t1_fks1j3f,1584486239.0,I hope you’re right and it stays that way in China. I’ve heard many virologists and epidemiologists predict that China is in for a 2nd wave after things open back up in affected areas.
Coronavirus,fkrgifp,t1_fkrazk7,1584468418.0,"I generally agree with that, but it seems like so many governments were caught completely off guard by something that was obviously going to be a huge problem. 

I live in Dallas, where one of the largest international airports in the USA is. They are *just now* starting to ramp up testing.

It’s like your house being on fire, but because the fire hasn’t reached your room yet, you don’t act. I think there was a middle ground between doing nothing and grinding the entire economy to a halt."

Coronavirus,fkms0af,t1_fkmjmb7,1584337878.0,Preach! The flu is serious business. So many people just don’t get a flu shot cause it’s inconvenient or not a priority. We could certainly lower the annual flu death toll if everybody just got their goddamn vaccine.

CoronavirusUS,fkmn49u,t3_fjbsv7,1584333422.0,"Agree entirely. I had the flu in 2010, not sure if it was the swine flu or what. I was 19. I’ve never been so sick in my goddamn life. That set me straight: I’ve gotten a flu shot every year since. It baffles me that more people don’t get their flu shot. The flu isn’t a joke. 

Plus I always hear people saying “I’m not scared of getting it myself, I’m worried about giving it to my elderly parents/grandparents/whatever.” 

It’s perfectly fine to be worried about getting it yourself. I do not want to get COVID-19 because I’m afraid of being horribly ill. There’s no vaccine for it. We have no immunity to it. I don’t want to fuck with that. It’s not selfish to want to not get sick yourself. 

In fact, the fear of getting sick yourself helps the more vulnerable people anyway. You’ll take less risks if you’re afraid. As long as your mental health doesn’t deteriorate in a bad way, it’s totally reasonable to be afraid of this virus."

Dallas,fkld10h,t1_fkja802,1584303667.0,"Yeah, this is bringing out the worst in people. I have friends who I love dearly who are still going out to clubs, etc. This is after 6 weeks of warning them that this is coming, prepare to alter your habits in the near future.

They didn’t listen to me, which I understand. I’m just a guy.

But then the CDC came out with the same message. They won’t listen to them? Or the WHO? 

It’s very frustrating. I understood it for a while, but now it’s just plainly obvious to anybody with two brain cells to rub together what happens to cities who delay taking precautions. 

Do they really need a CCP style quarantine? Some people are stupid and selfish enough that maybe being welded into their homes is the only thing for them. 

(I don’t actually mean that, I’m just frustrated plz don’t yell at me)"

Coronavirus,fkjhdpz,t1_fkim8cs,1584245971.0,"Great comment. I’ve been struggling with my emotional regulation around this very thing. I’ll work myself into a frenzy reading articles and listening to interviews with worried experts. But I’m a 28 year old man with no known health problems. 

It can be very difficult to know how to react to something that could potentially kill many millions of people, but almost certainly won’t kill me. It’s like it short circuits my brain."
Coronavirus,fkjasja,t1_fkiwqqf,1584240720.0,"And therein lies the problem. When we can plainly see the very low level of tests being done in the US as compared to other affected countries, we can confidently infer that we aren’t getting good information. Rumors and hearsay fill that void."
CoronavirusUS,fkhs043,t1_fkhh7rt,1584204885.0,My man. You were way ahead of us who were way ahead of everybody else. Respect.
Dallas,fkh7ivh,t1_fkgtu8m,1584191228.0,"You have no idea what the facts are. This isn’t just something that runs its course through a population, killing some old people here and there. 

It creates a huge number of cases which require hospitalization, and not just of the old. But also of the young, the healthy, ones without co-morbidities. 

Then your hospitals are clogged up. Staff becomes ill. People who need treatment for other things, like cancer, don’t have the same access they had before the outbreak. All this shit is well documented in every country that’s experienced a large outbreak so far. 

This is about flattening the curve of the outbreak to ensure there aren’t more active cases than the local hospitals can handle at any given point. 

Your sanguine attitude about this whole thing because your grandma has made her peace? THATS a marshmallow of feel good nonsense."

texas,fkgt622,t1_fkfy8gs,1584173065.0,"Have you been paying attention to what’s going on in Italy? It’s much more complex than that. People are going over the top now because it’s been downplayed for so long, and it’s become obvious that this is not a flu/cold. So now people are freaking out. The messaging around this has been terrible from both the media and government officials. 

There’s good information out there, and it’s not exactly painting a rosy picture. A “mild” case of this just means you don’t need hospitalization. A “mild” case can include viral pneumonia."

The shelves looked overstocked, actually, as though the store was prepared for a serious rush. But the paper goods isle was barren. Dried rice/beans were a bit sparse as well. About half the shoppers there were leaving with totally overloaded carts, so I think people are taking it a bit more seriously after Trumps address."
