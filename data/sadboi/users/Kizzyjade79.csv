We have a young son and I am left to raise him by myself as well as cope with the loss. I know the pain it leaves in its wake and the unanswerable questions, the sadness and the grief. I find myself replaying the morning I found his lifeless body and not questioning why he did it but why I did not know he was in so much pain that he seen that as the only way to relieve it. I don't know your life to give you reasons to choose life l, I agree life is painful and tough and at times so bleak. Their has been days this life has been so hard because I want to be with him I miss him but I know I can not leave our son. I can relate to your grief and understand the pain but it leaves a wake of pain in its path too."
