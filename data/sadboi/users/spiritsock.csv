Codependency doesn't equate to a stable relationship. 

To answer more specifically though, I'm a prepper and a planner. My significant other is more spontaneous and feels strangled when guided by a schedule.

You're smart, motivated and clearly very interested in asking for insight on your behavior. That shows quite a bit about your ability to be a friend, right?

I'm neither pro or anti for you to medicate with cannabis because I think you know what you need to do for your own growth process etc. But, if you choose to do so, just talk to the budtender about what your concerns are.

The point isn't to avoid the thoughts, or to be without thought. You're just there to *witness* what thoughts bubble to the surface without attachment to them. That doesn't mean, ""How do I stop being consumed by the thoughts that surface"". Think less of the thoughts as the issue, and more as your fixation on them as the observer. Why are you attaching to *those* thoughts? Then, just let your mind go where it would like to lead you. 

You trying to control where your mind is going is the obstacle here I guess. Release control of what you think *should* happen and focus on being present with whatever you see, don't push anything away as unworthy or a hindrance to the ""meditation""."
