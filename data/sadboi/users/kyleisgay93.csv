breakingbad,fqio1q7,t1_fqij3dd,1589398566.0,"This was my thoughts too. I don‚Äôt think Walt ever truly wanted to harm Jesse. He viewed him as family, in their own little meth cooking, dysfunctional way lol"

breakingbad,fqi6fr9,t1_fqhyhux,1589391146.0,I didn‚Äôt even know there was a show called Better Call Saul! I‚Äôll definitely be checking that out.
breakingbad,fqi6e6g,t1_fqi0ecp,1589391118.0,"Without having seen El Camino yet, this is my thoughts. I loved living in that world of BB every episode. I felt so invested and interested in everything that was happening. The stakes were so high. I still can‚Äôt believe how crazy those last few episodes were before the finale. The final showdown with Hank and his partner, and just how everything happened. It was one of those shows that I was just never able to predict what would happen next. The writers were just genius!"
PrettyLittleLiars,fpdpz78,t3_gcpayl,1588531890.0,"I feel like every A had their very own personal reasons, but each had in common the fact that they felt like outcasts and that no one loved or cared for them. Alex was definitely the most desensitized of them all, followed by Charlotte. Mona‚Äôs reign as A was the most personal, as she had suffered at the hands of the liars for letting Alison torture her and do nothing to stop it."
PrettyLittleLiars,fpdpfqw,t3_gcoo7v,1588531584.0,"Probably Ali‚Äôs scene in 4x13, ‚Äúdid you miss me?‚Äù After speculating for 4 seasons if she was dead or alive, to finally have her turning around in the red coat, and bam! Ahh still get chills."

PrettyLittleLiars,fowucby,t1_fovnqf9,1588127327.0,"We came kinda close to it with Monas, but she came in literally seconds after Spencer put it together. It would‚Äôve been really nice tho for the Big A reveal to have been pieced together by the liars. I was alright with the Alex reveal scene tho with the mirror and all, that was good"
PrettyLittleLiars,fov46h4,t3_g9psyr,1588095095.0,"Having Alison as A would have been cool and all, but considering the show already went with the books first A with Mona, going the route of Ali would have been a bit redundant. I liked both the Charlotte and Alex reveals, it was just the execution of both that was the problem."
PrettyLittleLiars,fov2t6d,t1_fotwh26,1588094465.0,I notice things like this each time I rewatch. Love it!

TopsAndBottoms,fosyglh,t3_g9cwb0,1588040696.0,"I‚Äôve been with my partner for over two years, and it‚Äôs only been in the past few months that I have felt truly comfortable. I considered myself a top before him, but once we got together it became clear he was a strict top only lol. It wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt enjoy bottoming before him, or even at the beginning stages of our relationship, but I really struggled with feeling comfortable and relaxed enough to get fucked. I have a history of sexual abuse as a child which probably contributes a lot to that, but now that I‚Äôve gained enough ease and comfort with it, I love it so much. Obviously everyone is different though, and it will vary from person to person. My biggest piece of advice is to get out of your head and into your body. Like others have suggested, taking some sort of fiber supplement definitely helps. I think I‚Äôve had a very small ‚Äúmess‚Äù once or twice, and that‚Äôs just bound to happen every now and then. A good top will laugh it off, or won‚Äôt pay any mind."
PrettyLittleLiars,fosxut3,t1_fosw8rz,1588040329.0,"Yeah, I particularly enjoyed seeing Alison around. People complain about how it changed the dynamic, but that was the whole point of bringing her back. We got to see her grow and change as a person. I think her going to prison, all to then get out and learn she had this hidden family member that her parents kept secret was a game changer for her. It was realistic to not be the 14 year Ali who was just a bitch. It was a natural arc for her to grow into the person she became."
PrettyLittleLiars,fosutk3,t1_for718x,1588038500.0,"Yeah she didn‚Äôt appear much in s5. She was in the premiere and the Christmas episode. And not mentioned much after that. I feel like they knew they were getting closer to the reveal, and didn‚Äôt want us suspecting her much."
PrettyLittleLiars,fosumzb,t3_g934gb,1588038393.0,"It was one of the best, no doubt. Seems like a lot of people liked season 3 better overall, or the first two seasons. Season 4 is my favorite out of the first 4. I‚Äôm a major minority in this, but I personally prefer seasons 5-7 now as an adult, as the themes the liars are dealing with are more mature."

PrettyLittleLiars,fodkj86,t3_g6udqz,1587685830.0,"Hell yeah. That whole storyline is part of what got me hooked on the show. Jenna always stirred things up, and brought a certain spice to the show."
PrettyLittleLiars,fnqu3vy,t3_g3eeya,1587172263.0,"Yeah, seeing where Noel and Jenna ended up was pretty sad. They were both just bitter and wanted to blame all their problems on the liars."
PrettyLittleLiars,fnozp1i,t1_fnos7ck,1587136642.0,"This. It‚Äôs a shame because like most I was curious about her and what she meant to the story, but after seeing what they did with it, I wish they would‚Äôve never explored it, and we would‚Äôve just been left with our theories. Not only did they butcher the storyline, but hired a model who could not act the part. It was just a mess."
The100,fmuuxtj,t3_fxgsm9,1586399452.0,"This show changed my life. Watching what this group of people go through, and seeing how survival is so encoded into our DNA. I‚Äôm gonna miss it so much."
AskGayMen,fmuul92,t3_fm5322,1586399227.0,100% relatable. Workin on it though.
PrettyLittleLiars,fmtm2gl,t1_fmshgh4,1586375062.0,"I think a lot of this has to do with going from this mysterious flashback girl, to all of a sudden being apart of the main ensemble. And considering she didn‚Äôt have great writing to work with on top of that made it worse. There‚Äôs also the possibility that Sashas confidence was lower, as her body was going through some changes hormonally with the condition she has. Lots to take into factor."
PrettyLittleLiars,fmr4hfn,t1_fmkjae7,1586313677.0,"Yes indeed. Having worked there, he would‚Äôve been privy to these things. Wren had mentioned having a father who had mental health issues, and probably felt a connection to Charlotte from his childhood experiences."
PrettyLittleLiars,fmjzfx8,t1_fmjph94,1586140939.0,This. It‚Äôs implied they met at wrens time working at Radley.
PrettyLittleLiars,fmjyix3,t1_fmie6fj,1586140349.0,"Regardless of the reveal though, the 3rd and 4th (and even parts of season 5) just had much more weight on the story. I feel like the first two seasons did a good job of laying the foundation though, so it makes sense why a lot gravitate towards them. I‚Äôve just found that when I rewatch I get bored rewatching the first two seasons."
PrettyLittleLiars,fmgo3cr,t3_fv4yfg,1586053432.0,"I‚Äôm really surprised to see seasons 1-2. Yes, I get that the reveal itself at the end of 6A didn‚Äôt lead up to most people‚Äôs expectations, but the events and reveals leading up to it were still the meat and bulk of the shows story."
PrettyLittleLiars,fm33agy,t1_fm32r75,1585711776.0,"I‚Äôm starting to think they had multiple options in mind and went with CeCe. Loved her as A, but the backstory and plot holes made it all so messy."
PrettyLittleLiars,fm32j14,t1_fm31r3w,1585711229.0,"Yep! Kinda like Bethany being the one in Alison‚Äôs grave, and her serving no real importance past that. And everyone‚Äôs motives for helping Charlotte being money. Just lame, lame, lame."
PrettyLittleLiars,fm2zt2c,t3_fsnmyt,1585709321.0,"For sure the first two seasons helped me fall in love with the show, but not my favorite. I feel like the core meat of the show was season 3-5. First two seasons barely grazed the surface as far as the story goes. But it served the purpose of beginning the story, and developing the characters."
PrettyLittleLiars,fm24m07,t1_fm1x6yi,1585690513.0,"I always took it as she ran away from the story she was telling Emily and Pam, because she had a shit family. She met Charlotte a few years later while on the run, and they bonded over their messed up lives. Charlotte offered to pay her to toy with other people‚Äôs lives, and given Sara‚Äôs past with treating her friends like shit, she went along with it. Then once she got close to the liars to be a spy after the dollhouse, she grew genuine feelings for Emily, and began to be kind of a double agent."
PrettyLittleLiars,fm24dw7,t1_fm1z41f,1585690394.0,"I guess she was pissed at the liars for what happened to her hands, but let‚Äôs be real, that wasn‚Äôt their fault. Girl was just cray. That and Marlene needed a reason to keep her around as a suitable red hearing for the new big bad. It was stupid."
PrettyLittleLiars,fm1mxsh,t3_fsgjai,1585681329.0,"When it came time to reveal the big mysteries in season 6, I think the writers realized that A was going to have needed an accomplice to pull off everything they did. Not that this show is big on realism to begin with, but I suppose they were making an effort lol. They knew the mystery of Sara Harvey was still an open case, and decided to use her to fill some gaps. It backfired on them by only creating more holes in the story. I don‚Äôt think they ever explicitly answered certain questions about Sara because they expected us to just be so floored by the revelation of her being Red Coat and BW, that we wouldn‚Äôt want anything more from it.

However, they should know us PLL fans dig deep, and analyze everything. We wanted to know why Sara ran away, how she met Charlotte, and why she stayed. Considering they never gave any of these questions a thought cause they figured we were gonna be happy with the surface level answers of her being the accomplice that all would be good. Lololol didn‚Äôt turn out that way at all. 

I have my theories about Sara, but we‚Äôll truly never really know I guess. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
PrettyLittleLiars,flikxqz,t3_ffqo74,1585184735.0,"In season three when CeCe was introduced is the same one where Wren was shown to be working at Radley. It was later revealed that season he was the one who made the visitors pass for her. From all this, 4x10, and the series finale phone call scene, it just infers they knew each other from Radley. For whatever reason Wren started helping Charlotte, and once he became aware she was Spencer‚Äôs twins sister, he was fully roped in for good."
PrettyLittleLiars,fliio16,t3_fir9qt,1585183351.0,"From what I remember, Mona enlisted Lucas‚Äô help, and blackmailed him into doing it.

My last job I was working as a flight attendant at a very reputable airline, and that‚Äôs when the mania came and showed it‚Äôs nasty head. I spiraled into the worst manic episodes of my life. 

After being fired (which was a first for me,) I‚Äôve gone through a few different gigs, but am doing better now that I‚Äôm on the right meds, in therapy, and attending a regular support group. 

It‚Äôs not perfect by any means, but I am feeling inclined and ready to return to work full time. It‚Äôs a scary thought, but I‚Äôm ready to face it. I‚Äôve been caregiving part time, and just got offered a full time gig. So here‚Äôs to what‚Äôs next! 

Keep on keeping on my fellow bipolar warriors!"
PrettyLittleLiars,faof524,t1_fao219r,1576262961.0,"Yesss, I can definitely agree that this is where the reveal fell flat. I was always so intrigued by CeCe, and could never quite put my finger on her nor figure her out. I think to an extent that‚Äôs why they kept her weaving in and out of the show, and only showed us enough of her to wanna know more, but by the time they gave her such an emotional backstory that relied on garnering sympathy, that‚Äôs where the problem was at.

Comparing it to the Alex Drake reveal, that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt mind that we had only seen Alex on screen like 4 or 5 times. She was ruthless, and didn‚Äôt rely on making us feel bad for her in order to make a connect, where as that‚Äôs what they put the basis of CeCe‚Äôs reveal on."
