Redearedsliders,fpa0q3u,t3_gc21p6,1588438470.0,It looks great! Im curious about how cleaning up the rocky area is. I have a waterfall filter like that too and it was gross to clean out.
Redearedsliders,fowauey,t3_g9uvlj,1588116231.0,"I usually vacuum out any old food, poop, debris from the bottom and top it off. So i think i replace about 10-15% of the water every other day or so. Btw, i have a small tank that gets dirty quickly and a basic filter, not a fancy schmancy canister one."

You gotta stop and start the blender a lot to push down the pineapple because it gets really thick. Im gonna try a better quality ice cream next time and mb a bit of coconut cream."

Redearedsliders,fmn3ids,t1_fmn18yu,1586217434.0,5 days is still too soon. I waited a couple weeks. I would test and the water was fine. And like someone else said its part of tank cycling. It'll be okay! I was stressing the first time this happened to me too. Luckily RESs are pretty resilient.
Redearedsliders,fmmxg4w,t1_fmiw96y,1586213935.0,Well.... it could still be trash. Lol u let me know!
Redearedsliders,fmmx3ki,t3_fw4scj,1586213744.0,"Ive stopped using dechlorinator drops because i read that it's not healthy for turtles. Instead, i keep a bucket in my bathroom that I fill up and let dechlorinate naturally. No lid for 24 hours. I use this water for change outs or to top off my turtle habitat. Saves me a bit of money and is a more natural method imo. Also, the ""dirty"" turtle water is a gold mine for watering plants! It's a thriving jungle in here!

Ive never heard of Indian Almond leaves, so I can't speak on it."
Redearedsliders,fmimdh4,t3_fv9h9n,1586112462.0,"Sounds like ""new tank syndrome"" because of the water change. The ecosystem just needs to balance itself out. Mine took longer than a few days, but it cleared up. A lil patience, my friend, and it'll be crystal clear in no time."
Redearedsliders,fm5ggiv,t3_ft2uzc,1585772492.0,"Thank you for that! I was annoyed at first that my MIL gave me hatchlings to care for because i didnt want the responsibility or the extra pet bills... but my turtles ended up being such a blessing! It's so peaceful watching them swim and eat and play. The sound of water running is really calming too. Plus, my houseplants are thriving from any turtle water i change out!

Anyway, my question was... what kinda plants you got in there?"

Redearedsliders,flid328,t1_fli9d5x,1585180016.0,Yup! The more skin surface exposed to the heat and uv lamp allows the turtle to soak up more of its benefits! Thats why they do that awesome superhero pose. Super cute!

depression,fhfvswz,t3_f2qwaw,1581552481.0,"I can relate. I feel like everyone has lightning fast reflexes in conversation and im struggling just to understand what was being said. Im still working on it. If you want to know what helped me, read on...

I remind myself that there is little in this world that we truly have control over. It helps me feel like it's not always my fault. I can be hard on myself, sounds like you are too.

Then, i remind myself that im alive, which means i have value even if i say and do stupid things. Workin on this one.

Last, i do 10 minutes body stretching sessions. Yoga or whatever u wanna call it. I use Yoga with Adriene on YouTube. Mb 2x a week, more if i can muster it. Its free and i can do it in my give-up-on-life clothes. Physical activity helps rewire the bad juju connections in your brain. After a few weeks, people found their depression symptoms eased up. It's science!

Im sorry yur feelin like doodoo. Yur not alone and theres hope."

IFchildfree,f6yezho,t1_f6xs3yf,1573277323.0,"DNA frag, karotype, chromosomal, etc... I'm really surprised at all the available testing you've all mentioned because i feel like my 2 MCs were just ""unexplained."" I guess since i said that money is an issue, all the doctors ive seen decided i wouldn't go for intensive testing. Whats sad is that even if i knew why, it isn't stopping it from happening. Im tired of rolling the dice too but in the back of my head and heart, i keep trying. It's like im a sadist. Sigh. I just wish this topic was more mainstream and not so isolating. U hardly ever see IFchildfree women or men on TV talking about how they cope. If there is, lmk."

So for example if Voltage is 4"", you need at least 40 gal of water in a 55 gal tank. I got my test off amazon. The API freshwater one that tests pH, Nitrates, nitrites, and ammonia. It's kinda fun playing chemist doing it. I also use a water conditioner because my local water has chlorimades too not just chlorine.  I hope Voltage gets better soon!!!"
Redearedsliders,ersxztb,t3_c3s1vv,1561227174.0,I read that eye rubbing has to do with too much ammonia in the water. But i wouldn't know what to do if voltage is already sick. Im pretty new to this too. It does look like u need a bigger tank.
