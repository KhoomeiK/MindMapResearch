I do want to say a few things:  


* There's a ton of choices! The type of animal (mammal, reptile, etc.), extinct, or mythological.
* The animal can also be a hybrid! 
* You can have multiple fursonas! Fursona means, ""character, persona, alter ego, avatar, or identity."" You don't have to, but you can give them a story, a personality, anything! And if you want it to be all about you (your personality, your life story, etc.), go for it!
* You can have a different name for your fursona!• Here's some things to think about with the looks:

1. Clothing. Do they wear any? Do they have a particular fashion taste?
2. Color palette. Color of their fur or skin, the color of their clothes, the color of their eyes, etc. They don't need to have the colors that match the animal either! They can be based on your favorite colors, a rainbow of colors, or even with your appearance (like your hair color for their fur - maybe skin - or if they have hair at the top of their head).

Sorry, just thought I'd say a few things and some tips. Hopefully it's helpful for your fursona or an OC and anything for learning more about the furry community! Hope you like it here. (:"

The situations that happen after they do it can teach them bad things can happen. I don't know how old they are, but not everyone has the same mindset or maturity that we may have.

My sister comes with me to my nutritionist which is probably for the better because I could most likely be misunderstanding things.
