ferrets,fj80sq9,t3_fc0zz0,1583102569.0,"So cute!!! Question- I have the same ball pit, but whenever the fuzzies use it they jump out the top and it tips over. I put a book in it to weigh it down but that’s not as fun lol. Do you have this issue?"

ferrets,fj3f805,t1_fix0gut,1582981545.0,"Oh they have plenty lol. They’re next to their other bed. They actually drag them out of their other bed 😳I try to cover them and they pull them right off. My cat loves being covered in blankies however lol. I actually have bought yards of fleece material from hobby lobby and cut them into smaller blankies, and have found some great baby blankets at the dollar store :)"

ferrets,fikwemi,t3_f88y7x,1582488521.0,"I Have a few hammocks for my babes in my ferret nation cage, but one of them is reserved for toys too!!!! I get them a toy, first thing they do is drag it to their hammock stash spot lol. Then they just sit there and look at their prizes. They prefer playing with water bottles and plastic bags and just ignoring the toys!!! LOL"
ferrets,fhmowi7,t3_f3og6x,1581716042.0,"I think two is the best option. That way you can let them out and they can play with each other, and you can do your own thing. Me and my boyfriend have mutual custody of our babies. We both adopted one, and figured we could have playdates. They bonded though so now we won't separate them. He takes them for one week, then I take them for one week. They seem very happy :)"

ferrets,fh2bnwe,t3_f11bfv,1581244904.0,Damn guys OP here. I just so happened to be wearing my bernie sweatshirt when peanut fell asleep on me. He is undecided by the way. Still doesn’t know who he’s voting for. Lol. I just thought it would be funny to call him a bernie bro considering all the negative press surrounding that term right now. Not meant to be taken so serious. Ferrets can’t vote. lol. Thanks for everyone who stuck up for peanut he appreciates it ❤️
ptsd,fgnrw76,t1_fglz8sk,1580951544.0,YES. THIS.
ptsd,fgnrqwb,t1_fgmnvf2,1580951448.0,I feel the same. Very comforting knowing I’m not the only one ❤️❤️❤️
ptsd,fgnried,t3_ez7jrm,1580951296.0,"Omg yes. I have to fall asleep to cartoons every night, it calms me. Some favorites are family guy, American dad, and disenchanted. Cartoons, even crude ones, remind me of my childhood when life was so much easier. Before my trauma. That’s also why my apartment is filled with stuffed animals and unicorn paraphernalia lol."
ferrets,fg50tll,t3_ewuo6a,1580515519.0,"Don’t really have any tips, my cat is the same, hates other cats and has to always be the center of attention. I got two ferrets in December and she’s been fine with them. She’s more curious than anything, she likes to watch them play. They go up to her and sniff her and she’ll sniff back then they’ll go back to playing. She will occasionally swat at them if she doesn’t want to be bothered but it doesn’t seem like she hurts them, and she’s a 16 pound Maine coon lol. I would say go ahead, your cat probably won’t be very pleased with you lol, but I don’t think it’ll hurt the ferret."
ferrets,feoso1r,t1_feojsny,1579304870.0,I definitely won’t be making the toys squeak anymore. I had no idea! I feel so bad now. Thank you so much for letting me know!!!!
ferrets,feoslgg,t1_feoin8y,1579304828.0,Oh no!!!! I had no idea!! Now I feel so bad :( they can’t make the toys squeak on their own so I’ll just stop squeaking them when I play with the fuzzies. Thanks so much for letting me know!!!
ptsd,f0ndri7,t3_d5kn5x,1568767391.0,"I am the same. Still not sure how to deal with it, I really don't think I want to deal with it though. I have just lost all care about anything. I may be destroying myself, but it really doesn't matter to me. I self medicate to save myself from the feeling of numbness, the feeling of nothing. I drink so I am distracted and forget the pain for just a short while. I always wake up in the morning though, and the pain is still there. It's a vicious damn cycle."
ptsd,f0ndhsn,t3_d5pv1o,1568767186.0,"OMG thank you so much for posting this. I feel the same way. My mom tells me that she misses the person I was before that night. I do too. I feel like I died, and have been dead since. The girl I was was stolen from me, and I will never get her back again. Sometimes I still accidentally write the year as 2017, they year it happened. I feel like I'm stuck there. Nothing has mattered since, I have just felt numb and dead. Often wish I was dead, because it would be easier than this hell on earth."
ptsd,f0ncxes,t3_d5katw,1568766754.0,"I feel this so often too :( Even though the person who caused my PTSD is currently in jail, I still see him in the faces of people who look like him. I realize it's not him, because he is in jail, but seeing someone who resembles him always takes me back to the night of my trauma. Unfortunately I have no idea how to remedy this problem. Also would be open to any advice. Sending love to all."
