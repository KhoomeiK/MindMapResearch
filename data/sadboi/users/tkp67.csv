The therapist was clear that diagnosis was to be withheld for a period to help treat the patient to formulate one (even if there where strong suspicions). I know it might seem off or even manipulative but there are very important and practical reasons not to have a diagnosis right away.

The very important take away is not to project about it or put mind to it, save that for the therapy. My daughter's process was much more complete this way. This was not much different for me over 40 years ago to a varying degree. If you find yourself thinking remind yourself there is no benefit in that right this minute. Let it go for now. You will find the answers you are looking for, it will just take some time and help from others."

This doesn't mean we can't work within the framework of this illness to prevent or overcome this challenge. I think it only inflames the negative emotion to think that this is a choice. It isn't a choice, challenging one's self to overcome it is.

We did nothing to choose this illness, there is no bad intent on our part here. If we had to formulate these actions we would have the capacity to make choices in the fiercest part of experiencing intense emotion.

If I let myself get worked up like that I still can't just turn it off or avoid the after effects. The difference is now I tend to have the ability to prevent getting worked up like that."

Buddhism,f9q16z6,t1_f9ol27r,1575553269.0,"Nichiren would assert that the one vehicle is superior in means AND the only appropriate means for buddhahood in the degenerate age. 

His teachings are expanded from the Lotus schools who have studied all the sutras at length to understand the lotus Sutra succinctly. The Lotus Sutra describes the TRUE nature of Shakyamuni's enlightenment.

The true nature of Shakymuni's enlightenment is what it is really about and his enlightenment is the foundation of all enlightenment in this world system. To become enlightened to less denies recognition Shakyamuni's cause and effect. It denies enlightenment due to this causation and thus denies Shakyamuni.

The inability to recognize ten realms is a denial of Shakyamuni's enlightenment because it is how his enlightenment was expressed.

Nichiren recognized all beings in the buddha field in accordance to Shakyamuni's enlightenment."
Buddhism,f9mn3jw,t3_e5xvh8,1575465244.0,"Without Bodhisattva nature Shakyamuni's enlightenment cannot be achieved and that enlightenment envisioned liberation for all sentient beings. If our own liberation lacks that liberation for all sentient beings it isn't true enlightenment.  Shakyamuni's enlightenment and existence expressed both Bodhisattva and Buddhma nature.

For example a good portion of discord among various Buddhist factions is the lack of capacity to understand liberation without bias from all paths even those taught by Shakyamuni.

As I see it the real ""trick"" is to find dharma that works on a personal level and  promote the universal vehicle so people can encounter it and do the same. This sets the seed to treat all people equally regardless of their capacity, development or path, leaving them an open doorway while on a personal level we refine our practice through the various teachings, starting with what resonates best with own individual being.

Like the Lotus Sutra is a library with all teachings and our relationship with it the librarian that would direct us to more granular teachings for development, even if they are in the Lotus School and Nichren formats there is learning of Shakyanui's other teachings (as well as other sages etc)

IMHO Western mindsets  seem to look at things from a comparative competitive point of view which might make this concept harder to hold that is seems at face value."

Buddhism,ez4s93a,t3_czyqpl,1567691387.0,"One problem however is that this then makes Buddhism look irrational to those that reject rebirth/reincarnation doctrine as a matter of ""science"" which is an impediment to dharma for some. Belief in life after this one outside of buddhism is in decline and many see it as no different than Abrahamic ideology. 

Also these realms are as real as our perception, they are as real as the beings who suffer samsara and realize nirvana, they are as real as the minds that sense them, they are as real as the central nervous system that reacts to them. 

Rebirth occurs in a microcosm in our individual lives and karma can be seen in families effecting parents passing onto children and even biologically there is no independent origin so our existences aren't simply islands unto themselves.

No self means dependent origin not no existence, impermanence means constant flux not randomness without consistencies. Even impermanence is consistent in its constant change. 

As I see it the middle road in this instance is to viewing the relative preparatory developmental needs as required to understand the ultimate truth. i.e. life is a dependent experience which is both the same, both different, both not same, both not different.  or in other words to abandon determinism in regards to knowing the answer because our understanding will always be relative to our karma, capacity and cause; and the realms always a facet of samsara and suffering a constant."
Buddhism,ez4qgs9,t1_ez4l76n,1567690670.0,"Absolute truth is the realization of emptiness of self. We never escape the reality of rebirth however because even if the absolute truth is realized AND realization resultant in escape from our own rebirth in the realms that does not reveal this to others or release them from the processes of suffering that cause rebirth in these realms.

Their rebirths perpetuate suffering and the delusion that goes with it, something as a collective we are all subject to. So our emancipation does not mean mankind's emancipation and our personal liberation is nothing but that."
