Quebec,fr3daok,t1_fr31zyz,1589854944.0,"Thank you. Afterall NB does have a similar history to Quebec‚Äôs with the Great Upheaval. The downvotes dont phase me. Give me 100 more. I still stand by what I say and what I think. I believe in lifting and encouraging one another in unity. I love that I can fluently speak, read and write both English and French. I can understand and be understood by anyone in my province and country. I do believe that French should be preserved in our province because it is something that makes us unique in our country. But this is not the 1700s. We are not under attack and no one is trying to conquer our land (which was  technically never ours anyway). I prefer to see the beauty in what we have that no one else has. And it‚Äôs proven that having to switch from one language to another, wether you speak a mix of both (franglais as they call it) has an impact on our cognitive skills. I was born and raised speaking both languages. Went to French school and learned to read and write the beautiful French language. I take pride in being bilingual."
Quebec,fr2ila2,t1_fr246t2,1589837923.0,I believe that one of the most valuable assets that we have here is being bilingual. No matter to what degree most understand at least a minimum of English and French regardless of their mother tongue. I find it to be a very beautiful thing to have and that it should unite us more than divide us. But what do I know?

That was til I met my ex. The best person I ever met. The best relationship I‚Äôve ever been in. I hope I stay on a path of meeting people like him (or the one?) coz once you‚Äôve tasted the sweetness of what a good healthy relationship should be like.. well that‚Äôs all I want now."

We do some weird stuff as kids. Well... it‚Äôs weird how when we think of it but it just made sense back then.
