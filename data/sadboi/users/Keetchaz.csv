There are a variety of apps that have similar app-blocking functions. I think one of them allowed free blocking of unlimited apps? but otherwise had fewer features. There was a fully free app I was using for a while, but it wouldn't stop you cold when the start time hit; e.g. if a profile blocked Facebook starting at 8am, and I was using Facebook at 7:59, I could continue using Facebook well past 8, until I changed apps.

Of course that's not how it works, so when my anxiety would get bad again, the feeling was compounded by the thought that ""this is not how it's supposed to go, this is the opposite,"" and I was not only anxious, but also anxious about my anxiety. It was very hard to let go of that idea - I can't say that I've fully let go even now. 

Progress isn't linear. Sometimes it feels like you're going backward. But like, when you're climbing a path up a mountain, you may need to head downhill to find a better uphill, yeah? I just thought of that analogy, so maybe it sucks, haha. But when I feel like I'm going downhill, it's so real; it's extremely difficult to remember that this is how recovery works: not linearly, but eventually. Therapy is good; keep up the hard work there. Don't hold shit back. If you don't trust your therapist - whatever that means to you, whether they may not be confidential or they may use your words to make you feel foolish - don't hesitate to find a new therapist. If you've just started seeing them, cool, stick with it; laying the foundation of a house is crucial to the stability of the house, but for a long time it looks like nothing is happening. My experience with therapy is that it takes a while to see any change.

I'm doing well now. Not perfect. I had a bad panic attack three nights ago. And still feeling some low-grade anxiety. But I'm enjoying life.

Someone else mentioned medication. It may seem scary to you - there are certainly horror stories. But medications continue to be prescribed because they are much more beneficial than detrimental. If you have access to a psychiatrist, you may want to explore this option. For me, medications helped quiet the incessant ""anxiety about anxiety about anxiety"" feedback so that I could focus better on root causes of my anxiety.

I'm praying for the best for you."

Anxiety,fh810gb,t3_f1np0o,1581349603.0,"I was on Klonopin for almost a year. About half that time was at my prescribed ""baby dose"" (my psychiatrist's words) of 0.5mg/day, and the other half was very, very slowly weaning off. Fortunately the pills were easy to cut with a pill splitter, which you can get at any pharmacy chain in the US (Walgreens, etc).

I was super nervous to start taking it, but it didn't make me feel weird or loopy or giddy or high. I just felt less anxious, more normal. I took half a pill in the morning, the other half in the evening.

Weaning off it, I took longer than my psychiatrist liked, but he was basically okay with my schedule as long as I could show progress at each six-week appointment. He recommended starting by shrinking the evening dose, since I tend to feel more anxious in the morning. I cut off a quarter of the half-pill (saving it for a couple months down the line) and took the remaining three-quarter half-pill. A few weeks later, I stepped down to half half-pills in the evening, and weeks later on I took the quarter half-pills I had saved earlier. Then came the morning dose step-down. In the end when I had a collection of pill fragments, I took one each day from largest to smallest until I felt ready to stop entirely. 

Every time I stepped down I felt it, though never as bad as the initial anxiety that got me to the psychiatrist in the first place. Even after I got used to the step down (usually after one week), I still needed a couple more weeks at that dose to remind myself that I could feel normal again. This is what took me so long. But my psychiatrist was there to keep me honest, and I did make progress. My last dose was a bit over two years ago. I don't crave it.

Benzos are tricky. I don't take them lightly. But for super short-term use, like right before doing something that you know will cause you a lot of anxiety, they can help you normalize those activities. I have a friend who was terrified of going to the dentist; but through judicious use of benzos immediately before dentist visits, she can now get through a routine cleaning without medication and without anxiety."

changemyview,f8up781,t1_f8u2zm5,1574837692.0,"It's not even necessarily social pressure; just closely observing your friends and siblings doing the parenting thing can be enough to change your mind.

Speaking as a kid-free woman in my late 30s, I've never had that overwhelming desire to be a mother that some women describe. My parents and in-laws have grandkids through other children, so they haven't pressured us. My brother and my husband's sister each tried once with the ""when are you guys going to have kids?"" but we shut down that line of questioning years ago. I've had a couple of friends ask, and I tell them honestly that I don't know. I had an epiphany several months ago: when I think about my future with kids, I feel excited; when I think about my future without kids, I feel relieved.

But watching my friends and siblings (in-law) with their kids has given me a lot of insight that I didn't have in my 20s. In my 20s most of my experience with kids was seeing them in public, often at their worst. Being whiny, having a full-on meltdown. This is part of parenting, but this is not all of parenting. It's not even most of parenting. In fact, I now think the best parts of parenting are all but hidden to those of us outside the family. Quiet, ordinary moments at home, talking about school, drawing pictures, reading bedtime stories, watching your kid get super excited about that thing you like - I see how these times can be immensely satisfying.

Being close to people raising children has also helped me see a bit how very HARD it is to be a parent, which is why I'm still on the fence. But I'm just saying - deciding later on that you do want kids after all isn't necessarily a matter of social pressure, i.e. ""I still don't want kids, but OK FINE."" It can be a genuine change of heart."

Anxiety,f85915b,t1_f84x9ee,1574270226.0,"Anxiety is one of those things that's pretty straightforward to self-diagnose, though a mental health professional can help you figure out if there's anything else going on. 

As for seeking treatment: if you're in the US and have health insurance, call your insurance company and ask for a list of mental health professionals near you who will take your insurance plan. 

If that list is absurdly long (as it was in my case), go to psychologytoday.com and search for the kind(s) of therapists and therapies you're most interested in, to narrow things down. You can sort by distance. You can also filter for therapists who take payment on a sliding scale (i.e. charge less if you're unable to pay their usual rates). 

Call/email several offices and ask if they're taking new patients. You'll hear No a lot; that's normal. Keep calling/emailing. The Psychology Today website also allows you to submit requests for contact, too. Just copy and paste the same message to everyone. Something like, ""I'm seeking treatment for anxiety; are you taking new patients now?""

If you get multiple Yes responses, cool. I saw three therapists concurrently for about a month. I was honest with each of them, saying that I was seeing two others. They each were like, Okay but please pick just one of us soon? I did so, and the other two were very professional about not being picked. (If they're not cool about it, you don't want them as a therapist anyway.)

(Seeing multiple psychiatrists concurrently is probably a bad idea.) 

Another thing about psychiatrists - I had thought that psychiatrists did talk therapy as well as prescribe medication. That's not really the case. My psychiatrist listened to me and asked good questions and took copious notes, and occasionally had some good points to make, but mostly it was about making sure that the meds I was on were doing their job. It was definitely not the same as the talk therapy sessions I was in later. 

My personal recommendation is to try talk therapy before medication - but if you're in crisis, do whatever you need to do to get out of crisis. Medication helped me a lot in this regard. Weaning off meds sucks, but I'm alive and well today because I took meds when I needed them."

OP, I predict that if you break up with your boyfriend, your anxiety will be more difficult for a little bit, but then better with time without that kind of gaslighting nonsense in your life. I hope there are other supportive people in your life, whether they truly understand anxiety or not."

AmItheAsshole,etfwwml,t1_etfgupf,1562779269.0,"If I thought there was a good chance someone might offer me thousands of dollars for my lasagna, I would tell my husband to make other plans for dinner, or I would tell him, ""Lasagna's still here, but I'm still hoping someone else pays me for it.""

There are things that are reasonable to assume without stating explicitly. If I invite you to my home for dinner, it's reasonable for you to assume that I am doing so for the sake of friendship. If I start pushing my latest MLM project on you, that's breaking an unspoken social contract. (This is not supposed to be a perfect analogy for OP's situation, just an example of a reasonable assumption.)

The fact that thousands of dollars factor into OP's decision makes it tempting to side with them, of course - even for me. But consider that OP had no clue that it would be thousands of dollars. More like a couple hundred bucks at most. They kept the property open on AirBnB for the prospect of making a couple hundred dollars. This is not OP's livelihood.

OP is well within their rights to permit or deny anyone staying on their property. In this case they should have just said no, it's a busy) lucrative time of year for me; I'll call you if something opens up, but unless that happens you should assume that it won't be possible."" People HAVE TO make plans when going on vacation. OP should have been honest instead of milquetoasty about that."
AmItheAsshole,etf77bp,t1_etemoho,1562762263.0,"I would have made the same assumption that OP's sister made. ""She can't possibly mean she'll book the place one day before I arrive, because that would be a vacation impossible to plan for. It's a week out, no bookings, so I'm sure she'll hold it for me.""

If I had known my sister would rent the place one day before my arrival, I would not have taken the trip at all. It's impossible to make solid plans if they could be canceled 24 hours beforehand. I'm not even talking about non-refundable deposits - just anything. What was the last vacation you took? I'm sure you didn't just call out of work the day of, walk into the airport and book the earliest flight to someplace nice, call around for a hotel that still had vacancies, etc.

What OP did is the equivalent of me telling my husband, ""You can have the leftover lasagna for dinner tonight, if I don't get hungry and eat it first."" Hubs calls before leaving work - ""Lasagna still there?"" ""Yup."" By that point it would be a dick move for me to eat the lasagna right before he walks in the door, and my husband doesn't think I'm a dick, so it would be reasonable for him to assume the lasagna will be there for him when he gets home.

OP's sister didn't know OP would be an AH about the AirBnB timing, and made what should have been a reasonable assumption that if the property was available a week before the trip, it would be kept available for her. Should the sister have asked for clarity on what OP meant by ""last-minute""? Sure. But she may have just thought OP wouldn't be an AH about it. ""There's no way she meant literally the last 60 seconds, because that would effectively be the same as saying I can't stay there at all."""
AmItheAsshole,eted163,t1_etd4npi,1562729165.0,"Agree. ""You can stay here as long as it's still available the moment you arrive"" essentially means, ""You can't stay here.""
