/u/sabrinacolada is right. If you're going to confront him further, have solid evidence. Even then he may try to blame it on you or wiggle out of it. 

It sounds like you've already started to do what you think needs to be done, but these things are rarely cut and dry. If you change your mind and stay: Since he successfully gaslighted you, you will find yourself questioning if you're being paranoid every time he acts off. He will still try to blame you for snooping, not respecting his privacy, being paranoid, and emotionally closing him (""You've been so cold, so I couldn't help it when she offered me attention""). The emotional upheaval won't ever leave you if you stay. You'll have good days as time goes on; but, then occasionally your mind will wonder back to all this. You'll feel most of the emotions all over again.

If I see him getting to that point, I stop him and talk about how he feels and what he needs to do when he feels that way. I know ASD moms like the one described, and their child is always the victim. Maybe not a bully, but the mom behaved like one."

breakingmom,fbhk94g,t1_fbh7vho,1576875654.0,"I didn't scroll to read your initial response before responding to you further up the thread. I had a very similar negative experience when my parents found out I was having sex at her age and chose to take the same path. My reaction to the suggestions is the opposite. If I'd had a parent who was coming at it the way OP explains in other comments, I could see myself making a different choice. I feel for you and understand the projection and long-term consequences of punishing that choice. I disagree with your assessment of the suggestions here, but your point of view is an important one for OP to hear and consider."
breakingmom,fbhjcyk,t1_fbhezhu,1576875047.0,How could you not react? It would be irresponsible to not react. But a reactive response doesn't mean it's negative or lacking in emotional health considerations. What would you suggest as a more emotionally healthy response?
breakingmom,fbhimzr,t1_fbhbe9u,1576874550.0,"It won't initially make her feel safe. She'll resent the hell out of it. But when paired with a lack of shaming and the other suggestions offered; it will go a long way to normalizing sex, communicating the gravity of the choices she's made, and ensuring she knows the potential outcomes.

There are consequences to every choice we make. Using the word doesn't make it a punishment. To a medical professional, the consequence or standard response to having sex with multiple partners is STD tests, a pelvic exam, pregnancy test, and birth control. She'd get the same whether she's 15 or 25. I was her age when I became sexually active. Even having 1 partner and using condoms, this is what my doctor did.

I see why you jumped to thinking it would be a punishment, but nowhere in the suggestion was force stated. Plus any medical professional worth their salt will explain why these procedures are important without judgment. They've seen worse, I promise you. The other suggestions offered frame this whole experience as the natural consequence of sleeping with multiple people but also opening avenues of communication and emphasizing the concern for her safety rather than punishing her."

While that mostly rules out the dog leaving on its own, still possible someone did steal the dog. Knowing the temperament of GSDs - mine can be an asshole to anyone but my spouse when stressed - maybe the dog didn't cooperate so they shot it and dumped it."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fbe765n,t1_fbch6r5,1576779722.0,"Per OP, the dog is dead. Likely because fixing a shattered spine isn't as simple as putting the dog in a wheelchair. Ask Santa for some compassion for Christmas."
