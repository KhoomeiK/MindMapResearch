AskMen,fppr9kd,t3_gemiod,1588807614.0,"SO I LIVE IN A DORM RIGHT? I got a medical accomodation last minute last year to move into a single room and the room they gave me was a closet and the VERY end of the hall, on the women’s restroom side of the floor. I am a man. 

Because I’m so far away from the restroom, going to the restroom is a 30 minutes process as when I am on the toilet I usually lingered linger than else where because the trip was so long and I wanted to make sure I got it all out. 

Anyways so this one morning I wake up at 3:30 and I have to shit. I don’t wake up until 6 to go shower so I decided to hold it. At around 5:30 my bowels decide to wake me back up to alert me that I can no lower ignore it’s movements. P

As I’m trying to grab all of the stuff I need to take a shower, I feel pressure in my asshole, so my exhausted brain thought it was a fart so I let it out. It was shit. Gross, fairly liquidous shit. 

Thankfully I caught it with my bath towel so I shit in my bath towel, grabbed a few of my least favorite shirts to ball it up and carried it to the bathroom where there would be little odor and the shit wouldn’t be visible. 

I spent an hour trying to get the shit smell out of the shower stall I used, and I ended up febreezing the shit (pun intended) out of those shirts AND the towel before forfeiting and throwing them in the garbage anyways."
