It is super skin like, but very dewy. It’s not cheap per say, but not very expensive either especially considering you get 50 ml instead of the usual 30 ml. It can also be bought in a much larger size which is even cheaper per use if you use it frequently."

muacjdiscussion,fqkzi7u,t3_gir6kv,1589441098.0,"I got the Estée Lauder Double Wear Light Soft Matte Hydra Makeup Foundation. Finally a good foundation that I can wear!

I’m so surprised by how it just lives up to *all* of the claims they make for it! It has a nice soft matte finish that does not look dry when freshly applied and it stays all day! I can touch my face, workout or take a nap and it’s still all there. It controls oil and keeps its soft matte/satin-matte finish all day even without powder on my combination skin.

I was expecting it to be a bit drying on my cheeks, but it’s actually not and yet it controls oil. After having used the Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation (which is great but better for special occasions) every day for a long time it’s so nice how long wearing this foundation is, how I don’t have to be careful with it and application is a breeze just applying it with fingers. I’ve read here that mixing the two foundations together supposedly is a really great mix. I can’t wait to try that."

muacjdiscussion,f9mjfkp,t1_f9mhe2y,1575461580.0,"MUFE Full cover concealer is great for blemishes and as a spot concealer in general. It dries down really nicely to a matte finish and it has great coverage. It's fairly easy to use as well just don't use too much.

The shades however are a bit weird and it dries slightly darker, so I would only recommend you buy it if you can try it out in person and get a good shade match. Or if you are willing to buy it online without trying it out first then possibly wasting some money if the shade isn't right for you. You really do need a good shade match with this much coverage.

It's way too much coverage and too matte for concealing dark circles though in my opinion. But as a spot concealer it's great! Also even though it is matte and full coverage, it's easy to remove when it's time take it off."

One of the best lip balms I’ve tried is Paula’s Choice Lip and Body Treatment Balm and the original Nuxe Reve de Miel (the newer formula is not as good in my opinion).

Also applying a *thick* layer of lip balm at night is really important for well moisturised lips."

It's the same formula (an actual dupe), but the MAC version is cheaper, comes in more shades and has a normal dropper that is likely easier to use (the packaging looks better as well I think).

The Estée Lauder Double Wear Nude Water Fresh Makeup SPF 30 also has a very similar formula as does Tom Ford SOLEIL FLAWLESS GLOW FOUNDATION SPF 30. Estée Lauder owns all of these companies, and you can sometimes find the same or a very similar formulas used across their brands."

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwngbzv0gbY

I have acne and I’m struggling with finding a good concealer with both full enough coverage to actually fully cover blemishes and a good shade match. I really liked the MUFE full coverage concealer and I think it’s great for breakout prone skin, but sadly it doesn’t come in a shade that matches my skin.

Some others concealers that I have tried that can fully cover breakouts (with decent formulas nothing spectacular): Kevyn Aucoin Sensual Skin Enhancer and MAC Studio Finish Concealer.

I’ve also tried more liquid concealers like MAC prolongwear concealer and although it had some nice properties the formula was too thin to really stay on blemishes for me. It surprisingly also didn’t have enough coverage! I think thicker concealers work better for breakouts since they don’t spread as easily as the more fluid ones.

I do like to wear light or light-medium coverage foundations though, so I probably need a bit more coverage from a concealer for covering blemishes than people using foundations with more coverage. 

I’m considering buying a good full coverage foundation, but using it just on blemishes as a concealer since foundations are often available in more shades. I’m thinking of getting the Estée Lauder Double wear Maximum cover foundation, if anyone has any good full coverage foundations that work well as a spot concealer for covering acne I would love to know!"

With “chemical” sunscreens I haven’t had that issue, though I do worry a bit about about the rubbing disturbing the sunscreen film, it goes on fine.

Sadly my skin doesn’t tolerate the vast majority of chemical sunscreens (and they are often shinier than mineral sunscreens and MAC F&B is already dewy so it can end up very shiny). For this reason I rarely use the foundation. It’s a great formula, but sunscreen is a must for me. If anyone has any tips on how to get it to work with sunscreen I would love to know. I’m hoping my skin can tolerate the “chemical” Purito sunscreen I have ordered which supposedly isn’t shiny, so that I can wear MAC F&B *and* sunscreen at the same time."
muacjdiscussion,exi8i0v,t1_exi7dsc,1566323185.0,It kind of needs to be “warmed up” on the face. The best way to apply it is with fingers/hands. Keep rubbing it into the skin until it thickens and starts to drag across the skin that’s when it sets. I believe it’s because of the film forming agents it contains. Once you’ve done that it stays on really well. Very transfer and water resistant. But just a liquid mess if you don’t. At least that’s my experience with it.
muacjdiscussion,exhe4gw,t1_exhcvbu,1566302494.0,You can try putting a very small amount of Vaseline on a q-tip and then use that to apply a thin layer of Vaseline inside the nose. It can help with the dryness and might speed up the healing. That was what I did when I was on accutane.
