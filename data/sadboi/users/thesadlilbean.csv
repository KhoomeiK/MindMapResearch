I'm 18(female) I get called quiet or shy or boring all the time and I'm sick of it. People think I have no personality because I can't interact with them well but that's not true. I'm a whole different person when I'm alone and I wish I could be this person when I'm around people too but Idk what happens, I just can't talk to anyone properly in person, I get really insecure and I'm constantly wondering what the other person thinking and I hate it. I always feel like I'm looking at myself in third person and I hate what I see, I don't want to behave the way I do but I can't help it and I hate myself for that."

I'm not a bad student, I'm really good at the practical stuff but when it comes to theory I can't focus, I feel like even if everything around me was frozen I'd still get distracted, there's nothing to distract me really, k don't have a lot going on but I still can't focus.

introvert,fo2agob,t1_fo20ft0,1587455091.0,"Hey, thanks for sharing that. It's almost comforting to know that I'm not the only one with this issue. I've been in a situation very similar to yours, recently. Are we living the same lives? lol. When I started college, I got into a really toxic friend group, they didn't understand me at all, I used to be in a bad mood every time we hung out together. They were just so fake, they used to talk shit about individual members behind their backs but then on social media or when we're all together they acted like we were the best of friends. They knew I'm introverted and yet they never understood why I needed some space every once in a while and used to get offended when I refused to go out with them, they called me lame and made fun of me for it. They used to pressure me to go out and I did because I didn't want to be that friend who never participates, it was so exhausting and I used to end up having a breakdown at the end of the day. They even made it seem like they were hanging out with me out of pity. So finally I decided that this group wasn't for someone like me and cut them off completely. It's awkward when I see them in class, thanks to this lockdown I don't have to for a while. All this and a bunch of other things have made me really hate college, I haven't been able to concentrate on my studies and I'm failing almost all of my classes. I know college isn't like how they portray it in movies but everyone has always told me that this is supposed to be a great experience but it's nowhere near that for me. Anyway, I hope you fix things with your friends and everything works out well for you :))"

I feel like no one understands me, and that my friends just cause me more stress. That's not how it's supposed to be is it? Is that normal? Am I just intolerant? Idk but when this happens I push them away, I slowly distance myself from them and finally cut them off. I've done this thrice now and I hate how easy it is (it's not EASY easy but I tell myself ""it's okay, you don't need them in your life"" ""it's fine you're only 18, you can live without friends"" and stuff like that and I block them everywhere and pretend they never existed.) for me to do this. Like I know why I do it, but I feel like I'm a horrible person for doing it. And it's pathetic but I find comfort here on Reddit, it's easy for me to open up to strangers online."
