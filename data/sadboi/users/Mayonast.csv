schizophrenia,fqvh046,t3_gkypxo,1589677073.0,"Psych wards are shat. I can't believe they let you have a phone. The way I see it, pretend to be fine and convince the doctors so you can get the heck out of there."
servicedogs,fqvfrfr,t3_gl1ens,1589676333.0,"You should definitely talk to a psychiatrist. You need to do that before you do anything. Training a SD is so difficult and expensive. A good dog can cost upwards of 20k. People may approach you and even be angry. 

However, you may need an ESA instead. It's a lot easier to get an emotional support dog, and you can train it yourself. You may not be able to take him everywhere, but at least it's a start."
servicedogs,fqu8a81,t1_fqtg0fi,1589653955.0,"Yes, and they already have. Problem is, when I have attacks I have the potential to hurt myself. I already have. I don't think an ESA would help in that kind of a situation."
servicedogs,fqsrj83,t1_fqqxh34,1589616330.0,"I have a question. What if the person (aka me) has little to no anxiety in public, but a lot when they are alone. Do you think that it is something to consider?"
servicedogs,fql3269,t3_gj906n,1589444526.0,"I am also considering a first time PSD. I was thinking maybe a Schnauzer (larger dogs scare me a bit), but that may not be for you."

Crushes,fqbd01m,t1_fqbcbjh,1589234733.0,I get it. I started falling for my best friend in highschool. I thought he could do no wrong. I was heartbroken when I learned that he was actually gay and would never be interested.

But she does seem wholesome, and I'm not sure why you are so upset about liking a straight person. It's fine to like straight people, but if she isn't interested in you, then that's that."

You may want to consider a smaller dog (depending on the tasks you need) if you are at a boarding school. Maybe like a minipoodle or a Schnauzer? If you go to dogsindepth.com you can look at their encyclopedia of dogs. It was super helpful for me!"
dogs,fqawcul,t3_ghtf62,1589226425.0,"So first you want to neuter him. That may fix everything. If not, (assuming you can't afford a dog trainer) I would muzzle him when he is around other dogs for the time being and look at self training him to be a little less temperamental.

asexuality,fq991z1,t3_ghgzn0,1589190004.0,I had no clue either. I do it when I'm anxious (which is most of the time)
servicedogs,fq8sqfp,t1_fq8n5f1,1589174460.0,A very good idea. Once they know how to be taught it should be pretty straightforward. What kinds of dogs have you taught?
servicedogs,fq8m70e,t3_gcgnte,1589169506.0,"Hey, op, you may be able to get a dog and self train. I've seen people that are very successful with that (some that aren't) and that way you can specialized the task you want.

servicedogs,fq8lrxn,t3_gen8o7,1589169214.0,"You may be able to find a trainer In your area that you can have a few sessions with, just to get basics of what you need, and then continue self training."

asexuality,fq891hn,t3_gh1w79,1589160962.0,I went to a girl's camp a couple years ago and they had swings over this little river. You could swing and dangle your legs in the water. So much fun.

His food must all be expensive, hypoallergenic, and he might just throw that up too. He smells horrible because his ears are always spewing pus. She tries her hardest to take care of him, but he's just always sick.

Is that why? Was he not bred properly?"

That's kind of what it sounds like. Believe me, I of all people understand that life isn't all unicorns and rainbows. But antidepressants and therapy is not going to cut it, and I would like to try something else."
servicedogs,fq7lfu1,t1_fq4mi58,1589147956.0,Being alone with nothing but my thoughts brings an anxiety attack almost every day. I don't think I would need to carry my dog around with me everywhere I go. Originally I thought that I could just get an ESD but I don't think that would be enough. I do okay in social settings and at the grocery store.
servicedogs,fq4nrfm,t1_fq4mi58,1589080092.0,"Okay, thank you. I'm aware that college might not be the best time to get one, but from what I hear it can take over a year to train a service dog like that. Was thinking of an early start. Also, I could probably pay for the cost of care, but not on top of a large cost for the dog."
dogs,fq1blgu,t1_fpzvlff,1589044122.0,I'm afraid if I get a dog with a lot of issues it may not influence me the way I need. I guess I need a dog that will almost always be dependable. (There's cases maybe that would make the dog nervous) but overall I need the dog to be able to divert my attention and stop my panic attacks from worsening.
dogs,fq1aw03,t1_fq07u36,1589043921.0,I need the dog to be able to notice when I am having an anxiety attack and help divert my attention and keep me from harming myself. (I've seen dogs do it before)
dogs,fq1aigz,t1_fq0es5a,1589043818.0,"I mean, I could go find a dog off the street and after a few weeks for getting him checked by the vet, have an ESD. I can easily get an ESD okayed by my therapist.  I need something that is bred and trained to do, really, one task. I need my dog to be able to sense when I am having bad anxiety and be able to divert my attention/ keep me from harming myself (usually I just start scratching nervously). However, on top of that, I need my dog to have good behavior."

asexuality,fg3yhic,t3_ewpb8q,1580492364.0,"I have to admit that I think my anxiety has something to do with my asexual preferences. I don't know if I'm actually asexual, and I get that ""fuzzy feeling"" that you talk about occasionally, but for the most part I don't crave sexual contact and find even kissing rather revolting. However there are definitely some guys that I find very good looking. Lol but I can't even hold a straight face when a guy takes his shirt off (I'm usually embarrassed or I am shocked)."
Advice,fg2u8us,t3_ewjlxo,1580456133.0,Dude seriously don't do it. I just got back from the hospital from an attempted OD and it was the most painful thing ever. Your body really wants to live and almost any way of death will be the most uncomfortable thing ever. Get some help now while your ambivalence is still tipped positively. There is nothing better on the other side.
SuicideWatch,fg2syp5,t1_fg2snnj,1580454594.0,"Yeah, I did just get home. And I guess I can see that, but it is basically just like an insane asylum. And they do have to make sure that you recover somewhat, so you don't just go home and do it again."
SuicideWatch,fg2ssrt,t1_fg2si2k,1580454405.0,"Yeah. I ODed on acetaminophen once but it was a lot easier. I basically just passed out. I thought that If I took enough it would kill me quicker. I woke up in the night and was bleeding and vomiting everywhere. I wasn't even able to move and I could smell it, in my blood, in my vomit, it was so strong that I could just.. taste the acetaminophen. But I'm not sure if that's right or not. You probably have just as much if not more reason to live than I do. I don't want to point fingers though. I hope you find a way to solve your pain."
SuicideWatch,fg2s750,t1_fg2rub4,1580453723.0,"I mean, my experience was okay in the medical unit. I had the occasional CNA sitter that would refuse assistance but I met some really fabulous people and the nurses were all super cool. But then they kind of just wheeled me into the psych unit without saying much. Of course the rooms and beds were uncomfortable and they actually didn't give me back some of my belongings later, but the really stupid part is that they expected me to recover when every night you could hear children and adults screaming and being locked in the padded room."
