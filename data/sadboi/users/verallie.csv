I want to stop pushing people away.

AskReddit,foyn3k9,t3_ga4gjx,1588175496.0,"One time I had a dream that I was walking through some foothills with a group of random strangers, when all of the sudden a massive tidal wave burst over the horizon and swallowed us up. Everything went completely black and I was then entirely aware of being in a subconscious dream-state, only I couldn’t wake up. I literally laid there, paralyzed, staring at the back of my eyelids listening to what sounded like static sounds coming from the faint hum of a distant radio. This went on for like 5 minutes until I finally woke up."
BPD,fov6hul,t3_g9l5r3,1588096172.0,I had no social skills so my first bf I met on a game online. I would randomly disappear and lie about being hospitalized just to make him worry about me. I often lied because it satisfied me to cause other people worry and pain on my behalf. I don’t do it as much anymore and I’m not proud of admitting it.

She’s literally acting like a sexual predator and your boyfriend is too non-confrontational to put her in her place; so, OP, it’s up to you to deal with this problem, and fast."

depression,foao571,t3_g6jgq0,1587649835.0,"Im a depressed person that goes to work every day, has small bouts of motivation, and a barely functioning relationship. I do things to make him happy because I’ve given up making myself happy. But I tend to go about it in a manic way; I’m either super loving and passionate and doing things for him or I’m laying in a bed all day whining how I feel like shit. If it weren’t for my relationship, I would never get out of bed aside from going to work."
depressed,fo5oly7,t1_fo5mvwv,1587531040.0,"That sounds like me. I’m always trying to “convey” something to him though I can never find the right words. There’s just something inside yelling “fix me!!” Because I really don’t know what I’m supposed to do, other than the obvious things which I refuse to do. My relationship with him is an emotional whirlwind of highs and lows. When I’m loving I’m almost manic about it, clinging and craving him and doing whatever it takes to satisfy him so he will stay happy with me. But once the veil drops, the monster comes out and it’s ugly. Then out of nowhere, that passion takes the form of callousness and withdrawal. I will quickly take note of it though and start plotting out how I’m going to avoid the devastation of abandonment - either by trying my hardest to ignore him and “pretend” as though I’m moving on, or try to act sweet to be on his good side again, like nothing ever happened. A normal person I doubt would go through this after every fight. It’s almost like symptoms of borderline. Though I’ve never been diagnosed."
depressed,fo442b4,t1_fo3ues0,1587497842.0,"How is your relationship with your boyfriend? I have a knack for pushing the people closest to me away. Anything involving family situations I just feel incredibly uncomfortable in, and any time my bf tries to include me and make me feel like family around his, it just makes me angry and bitter. Either I’m dead silent, or I’m saying things that come off rude or off the wall. If I’m being teased, I don’t know how to tease back because I was bullied and could never stand my ground. I lash out in a spiteful way and the teasing stops and the atmosphere becomes uncomfortable. I’m always judging and criticizing people like my mom used to do. If I feel like my bf is trying to put me into a box, I rebel even harder. I don’t want to be questioned but I also demand to be heard. I want empathy, compassion, and unconditional love from a person and it leads to expecting way too much and that leads to me becoming disappointed in my relationship with them."
depressed,fo310xg,t3_g5f1o4,1587478473.0,"It’s weird for me. I wouldn’t say i consciously enjoy being depressed, but my actions always say otherwise. There’s just something inherent that feels comfortable in a miserable state because it’s all I knew of my childhood. My comfort became entangled with my loneliness. I would often go into the woods as a child, alone, and act out some imagined story line and plot and pretend there were other people there. I crave love and happiness, as anyone does, but the longer it lasts the more I feel a desire to disrupt it. 

You don’t like being depressed, you’re just used to it. Our bad thoughts have become a mechanism of our being. It’s going to take becoming extremely uncomfortable to re-wire our thoughts and break the pattern that has essentially made us who we are. We are both stronger than our depression allows us to be. Try to break the cycle of negative thought as often as possible; the moment you start doubting or questioning yourself, you have to ACT against that person and slowly but surely leave them behind. The more you do this the more your stronger self will stay ahead of the race. I know it sounds weird but you have to essentially talk to yourself a lot. Leave yourself notes. Start becoming that better person and tell the old one off. I say this and I know how extremely difficult it can be, but we have to separate ourselves from it. It doesn’t have to define us. We can get past this."
depressed,fo2z3xl,t1_fo21nnv,1587477352.0,"It’s so weird for me. It’s like when people start talking to me - I tune in and out of the conversation and miss certain details. I do not understand enough about the world to fully grasp what they are talking about half the time. I end up just not understanding. At work, I dread having to keep up a conversation. I can’t look people in the eye and address them as it makes me way too nervous."

Also, what inspired you to do art and what was your favorite subject matter to paint or draw?

I’m actually going to school for digital media because I was too scared to attempt the graphic design program as it’s impossible to hold a full time job. I prioritized my job over my schooling because having the steady income is less scary then going to school and failing at something that honestly is the only thing about myself that I can feel proud of. It seems like I’m just holding on to that little piece of me and preserving it before I attempt to take it seriously and never become as good as all the other wonderful skilled artists out there (everything is always a fucking competition in my head) my insecurities and perfectionism won’t accept me being mediocre, even though I know the great artists worked tirelessly to get where they are and still failed a bunch, but my willpower just... isn’t there."
depressed,fo2xpxl,t1_fo1vtry,1587476515.0,"It seems everyone is on a fitness routine so I’ve started doing that and yoga and it helped, but I went off my meds and realized that was a bad bad idea. I get this thought that I can handle things on my own because I’ve always been fiercely independent - but it’s like something nasty inside me always takes over just when I thought I had it in me to get better without the medicine. I really do need a good therapist to keep me in check."

Small problems were incredibly complex to me. If a normal person takes one step to come to a conclusion, I tend to take 2-3 which then eventually routes me to the right answer which most people would have automatically come up with. I’ve been told I’m misunderstood, even referred to as aloof, not perceptive, bad listener, etc. I’m so fucking different from other people. I constantly tell myself I have a brain defect or a mental illness that keeps me from comprehending things that most people can. I yearn to be intelligent but I don’t even understand half the books I read and I never remember any details from movies I’ve watched. I’m so socially paralyzed that I can’t even form a proper thought.
My brain is foggy, murky, full of shit and despair and hopelessness."

The last one literally told me that she was sick of the profession and getting out of it soon. Gave me the most generic advice and grabbed her schedule book during the session to see when she would be available to schedule the next appointment.

I’m so far down the road repeating the bad routine that it feels like I require an overwhelming amount of effort just to get moving again. But what choice do I have? Thank you again.

Colorization,es2e8um,t1_es2cyr4,1561521520.0,"Hey thank you very much! Yeah, I went overboard completely on the highlights. My layers definitely aren’t evenly blended together either.

Your feedback is very much appreciated!! 😘"

pics,es2cswq,t1_es2a890,1561520267.0,"Hey there! Well, before I started doing this I had an idea of how to create realistic skin tones because I’ve been drawing and painting my entire life. In photoshop, you create multiple layers to gradually build color. With her skin, i started out with a base peachy color. On top of that layer, I added more layers and started to build on the shadows of her face and the blush color that you see on her cheek. I pick a soft brush with pressure sensitivity, so a light touch will still reveal the colors below.  It’s all just guesswork and constantly messing with the levels/saturation/hue until you see something you’re happy with and that actual resembles something... real.

Yes, it does take time and patience but it’s totally worth it once you start seeing your subject really come to life! I picked the subtle blue for her dress because I felt that it would bring out the warm tones of her skin - I kept adjusting the hue and saturation of that layer until I got it to a nice soft color that I was happy with. I also darkened the the areas around the lace a bit so you can see some of that fabric pop. 

I am totally still learning all the photoshop essentials myself. But I’m having a lot of fun and seeing my results and how I’ve improved over time is super exciting and motivational. There’s a lot of helpful YouTube tutorials out there if you ever wanted to try your hand out! But having a good understanding of color theory is critical, in my opinion, for being able to render the skin realistically. I added a range of different colors for her skin and just attempted to blend them softly and evenly together, and viola! It usually all comes together nicely in the end. If not, that’s why you have multiple layers so you can easily delete them if you mess up the shading or something."
