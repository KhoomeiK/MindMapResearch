Although I don't meet cryteria for BPD anymore, so it's easier for me to say, but honestly FUCK IT. When you say something it's whining, but then something happens to them, they have a headache, slept bad, anything and suddenly it's ok to whine. And you have to feel sorry for them. It's your life and your struggles are real. People like to feel superior and belittle problems of others and when they see vulnerability, they tend to take advanage of it. When you have a label of a 'crazy one' suddenly all your problems are not real. Fuck it, whine all you want if it's helping you to cope. We are all self absorbed as humans, not just BPD ones."

ArtistLounge,fb5nf8o,t1_fb39mwq,1576530837.0,"I agree, but honestly, my personality is in no way good for art. I'm bipolar which means I paint like crazy for a week and then I hate art, hate myself and swear never to paint again. I'm inspired for some time and then can't see anything in my mind for weeks. I've changed my mind and my style so many times. 
I have a deep respect for disciplined people who study anatomy, stick to one medium/style and become masters. I'm too chaotic for that, but even though I have to do it my own way. Sometimes I feel like dying when I paint because I hate it so much, but the truth is, I would die without it. 
My bachelor's thesis was about artists in prisons and the most important part for me was that, scientifically speaking, there is no such thing as talent. 
Just keep doing it your own way, at your own pace."

ArtistLounge,fb0wq46,t3_eb0q8t,1576429923.0,"I'm not a pro at all, but I was 22 when I started painting seriously. Before that I made maybe 5 paintings in art class, one of them was displayed in school's gallery. I wasn't interested in painting, but loved art in general. I was just too self-conscious, scared of failure and lazy to practice. 
Started 2 years ago because of new relationship with a passionate, self-taught programmer. I wanted to have a passion too, not just Netflix and weed. Sounds lame, but it was a wake up call.
I was horrible artist. I'm still not very good, but you can check my posts and maybe you'll see what 2 years of inconsistent practice can achieve."

Also watching documentaries about artists on YouTube, The Art Assignment is a really fun channel, about cooking and art, so it's not just dry facts."

Chociaż prawnie raczej nie dałoby się tego regulować.
