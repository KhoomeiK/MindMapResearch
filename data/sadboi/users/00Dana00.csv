I must say that yes, Japanese pronunciation is extremely easy for us in comparison to other languages. The differences are minimal. Effectively there is a difference in the position and production of the voice, but it is easier for Spanish speakers to make that change than for example, english speakers."
languagelearning,eunijtj,t1_eufiua1,1563929248.0,That hasn't been the case with me. While learning I realized that if I didn't like how the language sounded I lose interest more quickly.
