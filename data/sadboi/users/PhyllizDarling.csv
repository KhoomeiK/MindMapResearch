He's better off at home with people he actually trusts, rather than a bunch of strangers who although well meaning sometimes have little idea what they are doing.

He needs ""data"" from people he can rely on. This real, this is not real. You know. He has no reason to trust them, and often times the mistrust is only exaggerated, not entirely missplaced.

Meds can be helpful, but they can be a lot of bad things too. And when he is ""locked up"" the lack of freedom actually compounds the problem.

schizophrenia,fmut7lm,t3_fxfxj4,1586398354.0,"It's not all police, but it's not completely irrational. My bro is autistic, he lives in an apartment for people on social security. As you would expect from an autistic he got upset over an aid who moved his shoes. Small issue to most, but to an autistic quite frustrating. He went outside for a walk, stomped around and returned to his apartment. Someone called the police, the officer yelled at him ""Give me your driver's license!"" 
My brother kept responding, ""I don't *have* one."" 
(It would have been resolved by saying ""Do you have identification?"" Because my brother can't drive a car.) This caused confusion. My brother attempted to hand the officer the phone (my mom was on the line, who could have resolved it quite quickly.). The officer assualted him, by yanking him through the door, dropping him on the concrete, cuffing him and taking him to jail. When we arrived at the station we were told that all this was ""supposed to calm him down"" and in the dispatchers words ""we know how to handle THESE types of people"". Despite filing complaints and such (the officers involved broke several laws) yet they got ""retrained"".
In an effort to make it appear they were justified they continued to literally harass him, one instance they accused him of theft, a theft that didn't occur. They claimed he was on video tape. (Legally they are not allowed to interrogate him without representation, because of the possibility of confessing to a crime that he didn't do. Disability law.) Nonetheless he laughed about the obviously nonexistent evidence, and told them they ""made it up"". 
You have to file harassment when ever an officer or a department is doing so. Try to comply with what they ask, but if you don't file and complain then you are ""letting it happen"". The first one may not work, but as they pile up the truth becomes clear. This works in the long term, but in the short term it's a pain. Eventually they will leave you alone, even more likely to ignore things like speeding. Because they rather not be involved when it's a pain to them."
schizophrenia,fmkpz83,t1_fmhgdnm,1586164058.0,"Yeah, it's kind of like they threaten you with a hold to get you to sign. That's what happened to me. It feels as though they want dirt, ""Like Haha you said this. So I can do this."" All about leverage, but like I don't know if not signing will lessen the time. 

Someone I know refused to sign bc I told him not to sign anything until he had to.  He had a plan, but because he wouldn't sign they claimed it was a ""dream"". Like I don't know if they thought it was like sleeping or aspiration. They asked me to sign an affidavit, I refused because the place was a mess. They couldn't shift the blame, so they decided to send him home. 

He went home went to sleep, nobody died. It also has a huge impact when you have insurance or don't have it. I have insurance from being disabled. It's a bit complicated but I went in with tachycardia and having mental health problems from not having a med and ended up spending at least 10 hours in tachycardia and a week in a psych ward. (The nurse said to me, ""It's not like a bad tachycardia."") It's not their body, so it's easier to see if I might die instead of giving me a med. It boils down to money and lawsuits, not lives. I think we mean the same thing."

Just stay in motion, you're going to anyway. It helps make it bearable. Communication helps, I would text people about whatever came to mind. I had to eat standing up. There are treatments for it too sleeping pills and other stuff.

It is an awful thing to go through, so don't let the belittling get to you. Workers of the psych ward don't have any idea what it's like. That's part of what makes it awful. Not the proper amount of compassion. Keep trying to get across just how miserable you are though, I don't think it'll hurt. You can get out of there, and this will pass.

Remind them you're a person. Appeal to empathy. 

In this situation keep complaining, let them know they are doing harm. They say they are helping, but they are going about it wrong.

I don't know that it will or won't go away at 15mg. Doesn't make a lot of sense to think so. but some meds do show less of a specific side effect when at a higher dose. I think it's something amiss in data. It sounds like nonsense to me though. How do they tell how much akathesia a person has? Not really easily measured. 

Do you need advice for dealing with the akathesia?"
schizophrenia,fm78cdt,t3_fteq5z,1585816977.0,How are you coerced?
schizophrenia,fm7425r,t1_fm6knrt,1585812473.0,"The two worse are TD and restlessness. TD is when you move involuntarily. It starts with your mouth moving, like a jitter. Get something done about it quickly, because it'll just get worse. It's important for it to be dealt with quickly. (Not like the ER) But call your doc as soon as you can. You're just getting started, so don't let them bully you if it shows up. It'll be either switching the AP or giving a pill for the side effect. Now my case was uncommon, it should only start after a long time (years) on antipsychotics. If unchecked you'll start drooling, it'll go from mouth to your arm and spread, it only took a few months for me. You'll be flopping around and stuff. I don't have it anymore. It's real rough, but don't assume it's permanent until you know bc then you'll be right...

Restlessness is a real kicker. (I don't think we should call it that cus it's immoral.) You can't sleep, sit down, watch a movie, feels like a neverending wakefulness. I don't know how to get across to people how awful it is, largely because the word is so poorly chosen. It is not being uncomfortable. 

I think it's best to tell you straight up. It is a literal torture method. They keep people awake to break them, it's one used on terrorists groups by the US govt. It's not kind at all. It doesn't seem like the doctor's understand it. ""But you're just restless."" So there's the main problem. Try sleeping pills whatever medication you can that lessens the symptom if you get it. Don't ever take more than prescribed or suggested on the bottle. You may get desperate and 'oh it's just one more', and like it won't be. Suicide at some point may come to mind, just let the thought go and calling or texting people keeps your mind off the suffering. Don't focus on the feeling. It'll be over eventually. 
You'll have the urge to move around, pacing etc do so. Go for a run whatever moving that helps. 

I would put a movie in as I went back and forth. I couldn't really watch it, but I've seen it before so I could still see parts and have an idea of what's going on. I'd also crochet a circle, although counting kept my mind occupied I also didn't need a paper for the circle. 

Look don't be a slave to the doctor, if you really can't take the situation then you can lessen your dose, and try to ease off but only if you can't get what you need or you can't get another doctor, all other options exhausted. Just don't make a hard stop, because it could create many problems. 

Try to make a plan to shift the burden. It helps to have many people to talk to and be supportive. But you can't expect to like call someone for 6 hours a day. It sucks for sure though. It's really the problem that people can't absorb how BAD the effects are, so lack of compassion. It is that BAD. 

I know most of this is terrifying and I'm sorry about that. But I don't want you blindsided. None of this may happen, or all of it may. The restlessness may occur but only be mildly annoying.  

You can try letting the doctor know you're fearful of these effects, I take seroquel now which is more likely to make you fat and sleepy than anything. If you need to contact me, when you need help for the rough ride I'll like text or whatever. I've been through it so, it's probably more helpful than other people."

schizophrenia,fm61q7c,t1_fm4jc4y,1585784464.0,"Well you'll need a referral from a general practitioner or someone. It'll probably be a pretty short conversation, because schizophrenia is way out of a GPs skill. Keep in mind GPs tend to miss treat us, they think we are hypochondrics. Once you get taking meds and stuff, be wary of your GPs prescribing just clear pills with the mental health provider when reasonable. Sudfed the allergy med put me in an episode. You don't have ADHD, you cannot take those meds you'll go off the deep end. 
I don't see a psychiatrist, I see a nurse practitioner. I seen four or five PhD people and they all failed to listen. You have to try different meds and different pills for the side effects. But don't let the doctor or whoever bully you, it's the biggest problem. The side effects can be bad as it gets, so don't settle on crazy shit. Like they say ""But it's working."" when it treats the schizophrenia, but is killing you with some other effect . They have a fear that if they switch meds you'll go off of meds, or commit suicide. It actually happens to patients because they do that. Switching meds can be difficult, but it's less dangerous than leaving a person with a granteed bad outcome. If you're having too much trouble with a doctor, just find another one. If there's bad stuff causing you problems, you DON'T HAVE to transfer records. It takes forever to manage meds. It's the doctor's personality that gets in the way, not the skill."

But the medical people can keep you about a month, but it's more likely your going to be in the ER bored as shit for 20 hours, and they'll make a decision which right now is probably going to involve outpatient care, not taken to the ward. As long as you comply, then you should be out in 2 weeks or less if you get admitted.  

Can you find out what the staff is like in the hospital? Try to get pity is the main thing. Follow directions and the content of the delusion doesn't matter as much. It just matters that it is present. So, only tell them enough to diagnosis it. There's no need to go into anxiety producing details. Like it's just a bunch of lazy people who think watching tv cures disorders that I can tell from where I stayed.

I wouldn't know for sure, but right now probably is the best time cus the virus. The hospital is packed, that might mean they'll not want to hold you. Unless, your risky age and stuff.

I know a guy who went to the ER because he was planning a bad thing, very clear plan. I told him to not sign anything, and they held him in the ER but they just sent him home. Because no one would sign against him. (Couldn't shift liability) Nobody got hurt either. 

Also, I've never tried it. But I know telling them about whether or not you have insurance is like 100% of the decision. So, don't answer because ""It'll affect your decision.""

If you decide to refuse to sign and stuff, blame it on me. You can sign when you are confident or if they go ""if you don't sign this blah blah"" (threat usually more time) then sign. 
(In USA)

If you see a needle just ask if it's going to knock you out. Don't panic if they try that, you can say no. But they told me it was for anxiety, which I guess if you're unconscious you don't have anxiety. They can't force it on you or tie you up unless they can explain it on the form. Sometimes the nurses may yell and stuff, it's always seemed like they are antagonizing maybe just short tempered. Which if it happens just show 'weakness' (despite the signs cussing a nurse out in the context isn't really a crime, but don't go in planning on it. But they'll not touch you even if screaming) avoid aggressing especially if you think the nurse or the voices want you to.

The worst part is psychosis at first and being around others with the disorder. Then the staff are just easily bothered."

Also despite the lack of sense among the medical community ""schizo-affective"" isn't ""less bad"". How is having TWO illnesses less bad than ONE? No, such indication of ""being less bad"" actually exists in the DSM. One nurse while I was in the psych ward said ""Oh, the doctor might change your diagnosis. You could be schizo affective. It's LESS BAD than schizophrenia."" What a great way to be insulted on every freaking level! My condition does not improve with a different word in file.

Doctors diagnosis anyone who has ever had an emotion with Bipolar.

It's not the person's fault. It's what the doctor told them. But nonetheless it's not either word that is insulting, it's the ""pop culture"" using all medical terms completely wrong and not understanding them at all.

schizophrenia,flytjus,t1_flynlwf,1585608817.0,"Well, I'm assuming your not being literal about force drugging people who want forced drugging.
1q
I feel like it's the constant threat of forced drugging and incarceration without actual presence of violence is punishment for a crime that never happened. It just creates more fear for asking for help, keeps people off meds and hiding. Eventually, they get drugged and dragged off anyway. The fear of psychiatry isn't completely misplaced. Most people who are taken involuntarily describe it exactly how it is TORTURE. 
I think for people who are violent, physical restraints not drugging is safer and less damaging. I'd rather have such persons in a straight jacket and a rubber room, than poisoned under the illusion of 'helping'. And even with such necessity there should be many protections to reduce misuse of physical restraints. 

I never hurt anyone (well, had fights with my brother who most of the time was trying to hurt me over the tv remote), yet my doctor gave me TD and told me ""Just to accept it."" The side effects are torture methods, and to not address them immediately leads to many suicides. I have switched doctors may times, intentionally never transferred records, manipulated doctors, lied when meeting with doctors, and eventually won in the end. And that's how I got the treatment I needed. Takes a lot of knowledge and none of it can be learned by listening to a doctor. Doctors don't know how to be patients. It's sorta like channeling an inner psychopath. Cus despite wanting to help, doctors do so much damaging in misplaced fear. Patients are going to go off meds if they develop side effects that keep them awake forever, turn them into permanent flopping and drooling messes. It's depravity to care more about a extremely unlikely outcome than the real very likely outcome of killing your patient."

I met a white supremacist once, I talked to him for only a minute didn't punch him. He's just a brainwashed person, it's not wholly his fault.
It irritates me that this country believes its immoral and creates a movement to stop people from saying to 600 lb people ""You shouldn't eat so much.""
