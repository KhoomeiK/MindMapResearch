Also, don’t know if you read Chinese, pretty much all posts on WeChat are in Chinese. Of course, any one can get a WeChat account and chat with anyone in any language they want.

Meditation,fblr2sx,t3_edq7op,1576968093.0,"Thanks you for a very interesting perspective. I have been trying to meditate for almost 4 months now and unfortunately sitting still does not shut off my mind. The wild monkey, which is my mind, can only be quiet for maybe a few seconds at a time. While on one hand, I agree with that you are saying (if I understood you correctly). On the other hand, based on my own experience, I wonder if there are brains like mine that have certain physiological features which render them very difficult to tame/change. I wouldn't say it is impossible, but very hard.

I agree with you that the purpose of meditation is to shut the brain off. In the long run, this in turn changes how the brain works during the ""on"" state. I wish I know more about neurobiology to be able to understand exactly how it works."
