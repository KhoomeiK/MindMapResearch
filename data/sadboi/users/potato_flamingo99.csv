conspiracytheories,fok3pm6,t3_g7rm1u,1587834830.0,"You could look at this as it being a coincidence but then you also have to think about all the other things in the world. When something bad happens in the media or government that could destroy them something smaller always happens that covers it up and this happens to much for me to believe that this is all a coincidence. So personally I believe this is just the government trying to cover up all there bad spots and putting the attention on someone else.

mentalhealth,fk1sa9d,t3_fg0wog,1583785851.0,"I've had this happen many times to me before and all I can say is that sometimes you just need to get your feelings out sometimes this may be talking to a person or a teddy or writing your emotions down. Just know that you are loved. Even if you don't feel like it you are. And yes you should push through it because you can get through it and I know that some times it may feel like you won't get through it but you will. I promise you that you will. This may bee gone in a couple of week or days sometimes it takes a year or two or months but I promise you can get through it. And know that you aren't alone and there are people that you can talk to. My DM's are always open if you need to talk. But what ever you do just dont bottle up your feelings. Just talk to someone of some how express your feelings. And if you can see a doctor or a therapist do. I didn't even think that it would help but it does. Allot.   

Just dont self harm because it doesn't do anything you just end up regretting it and it's another thing that you have to try and hide from others. And if you are thinking about self harming. EVER. Just say in this subreddit or DM me and we can help. And always remember you are loved. I hope this helped. <3"

mentalhealth,fjys3o0,t3_ffjfd0,1583703396.0,My best recommendation is to go to the hospital because by what you have written this could be several mental health kind of things and could get worse really quickly and most of the times leads down a deep rabbit hole of depression . It could also be something that was put in your food or something you drank (a drug) and may get worse. Don't take my word for it because im not a specialist in this im just speaking from my experience but either way a doctor can help you so I would recommend you get someone to take you to the hospital. I hope this helps <3
rareinsults,fjyo0bd,t1_fjyjxt5,1583700874.0,"Firstly, I have been diagnose with many different things (Depression, anxiety, anorexia the list goes on) and at first I was also scared t ask for help and personally I have learnt that the best way to start getting help is talk to someone you trust and do just come out to them and be like ""I think I have generalized anxiety"" tell them how you are feeling and side in some of the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and then as them for advice and help then once you get comfortable talking about it go and see a doctor.

Another thing to do is to get familiar with the disorder (if you already haven't done)  and sit and just really think about if you think you may have it. Look at each symptom and think about it. For example with me starting to realize I have depression I had to think about if im always sad and it took me a while to actually admit to myself that I was always sad but you have to really think about it and it may take a while but you have to just really think about it and take your time dont make your self ruck into getting diagnosed because with some people it can make it worse.

I hope this helped and if you would like to have a private conversation my DMs are always open!"

To be honest I probably wouldn't be here. I know that the medication I have helps me get through the days and when people like this come along and tell me that they dont help and that the mental health problems I have is just something society has planted in my head I can tell you it isn't I remember when I could go out into the streets without having a panic attack and I would do anything to get that feeling back or just being able to do that again. I can tell you that the medication that is given to me helps. And it is usually tested for sometimes years so they know if it will effect a persons brain development/if it will have bad effects on them.
