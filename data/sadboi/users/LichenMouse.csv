bipolar,eqzcbdb,t1_eqvdtkn,1560397610.0,Seems to be going well. Pretty nauseous but otherwise fine :-)
bipolar,eqrtu1i,t1_eqrbvv1,1560269734.0,"Right? The craziest for me was when I smelt a gas leak that barely registered on the leak detector. The tester was surprised I could smell it. I've stopped asking people ""do you smell that?"" hahaha"
bipolar,eqp17sg,t3_bywrmd,1560194791.0,"I started my Lamotrigine on Friday. I was so anxious but things have been fine! Yay

&#x200B;

Edit: slightly nauseous at times especially if riding in a car"
bipolar,eqcyvjj,t1_eqb6o0p,1559980714.0,I think I am a super taster as well as a super smeller. I joke that I could be an airport dog.
bipolar,eqcyow8,t1_eqbmgd0,1559980619.0,I tried this and ended up swallowing everything wrong haha.
bipolar,eqcyiux,t1_eqaxv6z,1559980531.0,Apparently there is a chewable form of Lamotrigine. My doctor mentioned it but said the dosages are really small?? I almost asked for that kind but was worried it would taste like shit. And who wants to eat shitty gummy bears!
bipolar,eqcy6ik,t1_eqbafs1,1559980348.0,Noted. I will do all I can to avoid this!!
Anxiety,eqcxm0e,t1_eqcwae6,1559980058.0,"Right there with you on the wait and see what happens train!! I just started a new medication and the horror stories online... oh hell... should not have looked that up. I took it tonight for first time. Resisting looking for symptoms.

Yes, the obsessions... I once convinced myself that I had Rabies because a pet store mouse bit my finger (5 years prior LOL)"
Anxiety,eqctgwk,t3_by34r6,1559977703.0,"I usually have my s/o read all the side effects LOL so that I won't get anxious and not take medication. When I do read them, like the other day for a new med (still kicking myself for this) my anxiety spirals and I start to feel like I have ALL the symptoms or can't take the pills at all (shoutout to some kind redditors that gave me good advice/encouragement with this). 

I haven't tried SNRIs but did try an SSRI antidepressant. There were some side effects, which subsided with time, and it worked wonders for my anxiety. I went from crippling anxiety to actually being able to leave the house. I was glad I got over the fear hurdle. Unfortunately, I also have bipolar and had to come off it; I was lucky and withdrawal wasn't bad at all. It can take some time to find one that works well for you and that has minimal side effects for you. My advice, don't read the stuff online :-) if you can avoid it and rely on the pharmacist or someone you trust to help navigate potential side effects."
MaladaptiveDreaming,eqbzuqa,t3_bwk4vi,1559959718.0,When I was younger I would listen to music and rock in a rocking chair while daydreaming...
MaladaptiveDreaming,eqbya44,t1_eqancg1,1559958851.0,Thanks for the warm welcome!
bipolar,eqbxkr8,t1_eqb1537,1559958484.0,I haven't even taken it yet and I'm itchy already. Hahaha. Well... Here goes nothing.
bipolar,eqac5du,t1_eq99ydc,1559930033.0,I can relate. My doctor told me I present really well and that was likely why I didn't get the help I needed sooner.
bipolar,eqaby38,t1_eq9uqmp,1559929907.0,"I don't have ADHD but damn can I relate. My brain is never quiet! I tried meditation but I thought I might go off the deep end trying to sit quietly and clear my thoughts. It must feel fucking awesome to have a quiet mind. If I'm not thinking, obsessing or worrying about something then some snippet of song is on constant repeat in my head. That's the worst really. Sometimes it's just 1 line over, and over, and over. I really wish some days that we could try out other people's brains."
bipolar,eqabe1l,t3_bxqra0,1559929550.0,"I was in the midst of my first manic episode but things were ""under control"". My s/o was going away on a business trip and so we planned what I would do if I felt the urge to buy ALL the things I was obsessing about. It was a good plan and it almost worked. Then I found myself at a jewellery store... and my credit card got a little work out. I felt like super shit."
bipolar,eqaajgy,t1_eq9zrcq,1559928986.0,Thank you for the advice! I'm hoping it will do wonders for my anxiety too. My anxiety was debilitating and I was prescribed Zoloft (which was amazing for the anxiety) but that was before we knew I had Bipolar. Now that I've been off it for awhile the anxiety is rushing back. Lamotrigine does sound like an incredible med. I really hope it works for me.
bipolar,eqaa83v,t1_eq9wds3,1559928771.0,"Thank you so much for the advice. I laughed out loud about the shirt check... cause yup, I'd be doing it every minute, or more. The moisturizing and distraction are fantastic ideas and I'm going to do both. I didn't end up taking it last night but will tonight as it is the weekend and I can hang with family the whole time. Fingers crossed it works for me."
bipolar,eq74pq2,t3_bxb5is,1559840490.0,The stigma and shame that society places on it. I have only told the 3 people closest to me - I was terrified to even tell them. Feeling like I can no longer trust my own mind. I used to sometimes feel alone. Now I feel like I don't even have me.
bipolar,eq73s9j,t3_bx8abd,1559840033.0,"I left a career as well and went to something that was lower stress and had a lot of flexibility. It was the right thing to do for me. Right now I am not working at all while I sort out my shit and meds. Hopefully I can go back to it later. It took a bit for me to get over the feeling of ""total loser"". We are not what we do tho and all jobs have value. I think what is most important is taking care of yourself. A job that let's you do this, is a good job."
bipolar,eq7206a,t3_bx5p45,1559839193.0,Close... but where's the table? Gotta be dancing ON the table.
bipolar,eq71eci,t3_bxgtiv,1559838907.0,Not sound like much?? It's HUGE!! Congrats and good luck on the interview.
bipolar,eq6w70o,t3_bxf9bu,1559836442.0,"Dogs are the best!! My best friend growing up was my dog; I don't think I would have made it without him. No judgement, no explaining necessary, just comfort and also distraction through walks and playing. I was lucky to have him for 16 years; It's  been more than 20 years and I still miss him. I have two rescue dogs now and they are amazing too :-)"
mentalillness,eq6vc9s,t3_bx5h35,1559836035.0,"Sorry to hear you are going through this. Earlier this year I was terrified to tell my doctor what was going on with me; I didn't want to be diagnosed with something serious either, or be so vulnerable with someone. I am so glad I trusted her and opened up. The relief and weight off my shoulders when I did was immense. Trusting her has allowed me to get the help I need. Professionals are here to help -- I hope you share this with them."
bipolar,eq6udyl,t3_bxf6rh,1559835579.0,Haha. That's my face before I talk to my therapy dogs.
bipolar,eq6u6zm,t3_bxex8o,1559835485.0,Thanks for the reminder to call my doc. My problem is not forgetting to take them but not taking them because of what they are doing to me. This combo is shredding my stomach. Off to doc to get something sorted.
bipolar,eq2s18p,t3_bx00rx,1559743027.0,"For me it was Zoloft. It was good, really good while it was good."
bipolar,eq2rbd5,t3_bwxb8w,1559742660.0,I had a horrible experience with a pharmacist when I first started meds. He was so condescending and rude and dismissive; like I was crud on the bottom of his shoe. I didn't cry then. Nope. I cried when I found my new pharmacist who is warm and kind and understanding. He takes the time to answer my questions and truly cares how I am doing. So glad to have him as part of my team. I hope you cried because it was a positive experience.
bipolar,eq2qjjs,t3_bx1ft0,1559742242.0,"I don't have any advice to offer, sorry. But I have been there multiple times."
bipolar,eq2pqr6,t1_eq2pot1,1559741822.0,They could definitely get away with charging a lot more! Just sayin
bipolar,eq2pot1,t3_bx1ai7,1559741792.0,"Adorable!! Even tho it looks like the doctor might bite, I'd 100% pay for their psychiatric help :-)"
bipolar,eq2pa40,t3_bx257m,1559741587.0,Got out of bed on time!!
bipolar,eq2p6tw,t1_eq2lp4p,1559741541.0,Congrats!!
bipolar,epzza2g,t3_bwqnyw,1559675458.0,"I used to torture myself with thoughts like this. Now I believe that if I experienced it, it was genuine."
mentalillness,epzxw6y,t1_epz5pg1,1559674740.0,This is good advice. I try to think of how I would respond if I was my best friend and respond to myself that way. It was very interesting to realize that I would NEVER treat someone the way my inner voice sometimes treats me.
mentalillness,epzxlak,t1_epxkwme,1559674584.0,This is so beautifully said!
bipolar,epzx6v7,t3_bk3c44,1559674369.0,Thank you! Was looking for a list like this :-)
bipolar,epzvncc,t3_bwiwn4,1559673529.0,I have more than once signed up for a 5k. Each race I ran some and walked lots and no one cared haha. I wasn't the only one. At least it's not a marathon??
bipolar,epzuwtv,t3_bwq7mv,1559673117.0,"Honestly, I think inviting them over for coffee and dessert for your son's birthday was an awesome and thoughtful gesture. Their remarks were hurtful and insensitive which is a reflection of them and not you."
bipolar,epws69c,t1_epwdwmg,1559583409.0,"I'm on a low dose as well; I've just started taking it. I don't get anger but it makes me super super sleepy -- the next morning tho, not when/after I take it. I've started taking it at 7pm so I can function before noon the next day."
bipolar,epwrvt6,t3_bwb73e,1559583212.0,Just starting this whole med journey. Zoloft worked wonders for my anxiety disorder and then wham! it revealed the bipolar. Doc added Seroquel but things got so bad I quit the Zoloft cold turkey (goodby old friend). Now on Seroquel alone. Fingers crossed. Want to add that taking any sort of medication is anxiety-provoking in and of itself so yay me for doing this.
bipolar,epwjady,t3_bvwqhp,1559577248.0,"I am so sorry for your loss. I lost my mom recently too and I sometimes break down and cry, full on ugly cry, in public. It is hard to be so vulnerable but it's okay to be; please don't hate yourself for being human and loving and missing someone. I went to a grief support group for awhile. It helped to talk to others who had lost their mom. I learned to be kind to myself through this. Is there anyone you can talk to?"
bipolar,epwgujf,t3_bwabjo,1559575501.0,Almost spit my coffee at the screen laughing. Thanks for the laugh on a grey day.
bipolar,epwgmbd,t3_bw4foc,1559575339.0,So true!
bipolar,eptt26y,t3_bvsgwb,1559497017.0,"Day two on ride to bottom after first manic episode. My self care plans for today are... doing absolutely nothing important and not feeling guilty about it! I am going to try to keep my mind empty by doing mindless things: watching TV, playing games on my phone, eating ice cream..."
mentalillness,eptr15p,t3_bvze1z,1559495863.0,"Hi, I experienced something similar when I was 12 and hospitalized for severe depression. My family also thought I could ""just get over it"" and the mental health professionals told me there was ""nothing else"" they could do for me.

It took me a long time to get those messages out of my head and trust another therapist but I have found many wonderful and compassionate professionals to talk to since then. People who listen and understand that I may not be able to say what I need to say and are patient while I find my words. Trying the psychological help centre on your campus sounds like a good place to start and if that isn't a good match for you there are so many other options. Hang in there. You aren't alone."
bipolar,eptp8dr,t1_eptlffw,1559494827.0,I'm not sure yet. I've got a couple of design ideas. Need to go in and see a tattoo artist to get some input.
bipolar,epta77i,t3_bvv540,1559485694.0,"Very nice! Simple, meaningful and a good reminder. I've been thinking about getting a tattoo."
