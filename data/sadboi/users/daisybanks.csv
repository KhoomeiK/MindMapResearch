There will of course be swings of dullness and detachment when I start to feel some depressive symptoms, but that initial feeling that you're describing goes away after an adjustment period to your meds. At least in my experience! Good luck with everything! And feel free to reach out if you have other questions :)"
BipolarReddit,f7ead5x,t3_dvnp8c,1573652180.0,"Maybe a better way to divide it is by the amount of time you've been diagnosed. Like a 5 years+ group - then there's not necessarily an age requirement but rather a requirement of having dealt with the initial blow of getting the diagnosis and having time to adjust to a new lifestyle as a result. It would be nice to have a group of people to talk to people who aren't necessarily dealing with coming to terms with their diagnosis or picking up the pieces after a first major episode.


Having personally moved on from that stage, I'd really enjoy having a community that knows more about their illness and how to deal with their ups and downs based on past experiences. Sharing tips and resources on how to make improvements for yourself when living with bipolar."

I went and got myself a tubal ligation a little over a week ago for some of those very same reasons. I wouldn't ever want to bring another person to this world, knowing that they risk having the same terrible experiences with mental health issues as I have. For me, any chance is too big of a chance. 

If I ever choose motherhood I would like to adopt, but I'd only want to do so if I know that I have a good and strong support system, ideally one including a long-term partner who would stand by me through any episodes. 

Someone's mental health should be a valid enough reason to chose to forego parenthood, and I'm looking forward to the day where a choice like this doesn't have to be or feel taboo."

I think it's probably a tolerance thing and once the body gets used to having this medication consistently, the dullness fades as a side effect. My shaky hands and mouth dryness are also much better, but I suspect the second one is due to constantly having a water bottle on me now. The shakiness faded sooner than the dullness though."

I guess there's some adjustment period while your body gets used to you having that in your system as well and then you'll be back to usual. I started taking lithium in 2014 and luckily it works for me. I also remember just generally being a lot more hungry and just generally having an increased appetite. That has also gone.

science,etuajly,t1_etu9tid,1563208179.0,"Yes. It definitely is. Reaching a point where you're not all-consumed by the depression is definitely beneficial. If video games can even briefly allow you to escape your hell of a mind, then that's positive progress in terms of eventually getting out of it.

Obviously there are ways to directly target the depression, but those depend strongly on your resources and the assistance you may have available to you. But depression is often not ""resolved"" as simply as you're suggesting, so I'd say this technique (playing video games to distract from or lift your emotional state) is extremely beneficial to your healing process."

And in that regard, ""changing society's limits"" would relate to gaining acceptance and understanding for being ""slightly unhappy"" or ""wildly happy' in different periods of our lives, and thus making our version of normal fit in to society's framework of normality. 

That's how I see it anyhow! I'd love to be corrected if there is a different meaning behind this graph. :)"

I'm also diagnosed bipolar (type 1) and honestly cannot see a way in which I would be able to balance going to classes, doing readings/homework and and having a job on the side. I'm currently on my fourth year of a three year bachelor and have recently gotten a dispensation to extend my studies by another year(!). Recently, I started getting extremely intense mixed depressive and hypomanic symptoms after a big project I had to hand in and was thankfully able to get a medical leave with the help of my study advisor. I'm doing better, but can't stress enough how important I've found it is to not overwork myself. 

To me personally, as someone who also has bipolar, I think you're setting yourself up to struggle by adding on the extra stress that comes along with a job. My advice would be to focus on college and don't overwork yourself by spending your energy on a job at this point in time.
