AskReddit,ezu9n7h,t3_d224cg,1568147954.0,"I'm a nurse, and I've seen some shit. Let me tell ya. Probably the most fucked up is a patient who cut himself from his belly button up to his sternum using glass from a broken tv, intestines spilling out. After he had surgery and came back, he was restrained to ""protect himself"". So what does he do? Starts biting his biceps and gets a vein stuck in his teeth. Yep... That was a good time."
