simpleliving,fr5t42h,t3_gmqom8,1589914214.0,"I agree, but it's not always realistic. I quit a job at a nonprofit. I stayed for a long time because I loved my clients but the work wasn't even fulfilling anymore since I wasn't given the tools to do my job properly. I also realized that while I don't care if I'm rich I was working my booty off for minimum wage. The last straw was an overachieving manager that was overly critical and would frequently call during days/times off despite being warned by HR not to. All that to say I quit and took a job on a farm. It was hard work too and the boss was a bit much but at least he never harassed me outside working hours and the pay was ok. Unfortunately within a year the farm was sold off and we all lost our jobs. I had to go crawling back to my old job. It's hit home during the pandemic how little they really care about us. When I can leave again I will but for now I have bills to pay and need to eat so I have to suck it up."
