Their demon forms were taken away from them, leaving them as only weak humans to survive in a lowly island, which was named 'Monochrome Island'.

However, they managed to gain followers named 'sinners'(basic, I know) and they moved to the island.

The gods were furious, and sent execuitioners from the capital to execute them.

However, Lust somehow managed to plead her self innocent and was let off with no charged at all, and to the present day, now has a family."

FantasyWorldbuilding,fn4xpq9,t3_fzholb,1586651271.0,"My 'divine system'(quoting another commenter on here) is not very polished from my area. However, I am trying to fix it to perfection.

The 'Gods'are demonic creatures who chose to spare the world of Skadus because they saw a lot of potential of they rules over and 'protected the people'.

Now, their names arent really decided yet, but there are seven gods in total, and a king of those seven demons.

The demons can shape shift into humans, and the main antagonist relates to this ability, something I would rather keep secret.

Now, they are all very beautiful in their human form, and a fairytale about one such demon 'The King Of The Seven Stars' emerges from am ancient folktale of when the demons came to visit Skadus, and how they are all blessed that they protect them.

A problem is: you cannot see their demon form, you can only see their human form. If anybody ever does, their soul will be erased.

They are believed to the 'extraterrestrials' that humans talk about. Since they have superhuman intelligence.

Their power comes from a significant item in each of their human forms, whether it be a necklace to a tiny hair pin. In their demon forms, it is actually part of their demonic soul they rip out to become human so that they dont act demonic in front of them."
