It is either getting a sick pleasure from our pain (like the Stoics suggest) or made mistakes during the creation process. Plato believed it is a Craftsman God that constantly alters its creation. The other main philosopher (I can't really remember his name) thought the Godhead just made the universe and stepped back to watch everything unfold. The Stoics believed if it's matter it's evil, he created the universe with the intention of destroying lives and the matter that contains evil. 

Archons are demon-like entities that coexist in matter. They initiate evil in the world.

The Logos (a part of the Godhead some thought was Jesus) comprises the universe and our minds in some philosophies, and is intelligent and very much animistic. It sends us messages by way of Angels. 

Concerning the Godhead, some gnostics believe it is a man God and woman goddess (Sophia, or Wisdom) that created Jesus, or the Logos, making the Godhead triumvirate. 

Any way it goes, gnostics question Christianity while still being a part of it. They try to achieve Gnosis, or knowing through this questioning."
