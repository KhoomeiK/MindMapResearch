One day for lunch, he wanted to eat but just wanted his lunch without the meat (which they could’ve easily done for him). The lunch lady refused to do it, so he jumped over the counter, got it himself, jumped back over and slammed his money down by the register before walking out of the cafeteria."

You’re not wrong for wanting what you want, but definitely compromise somewhere."

While you were in the wrong not to check the cake before leaving the store, you still made an effort to help your wife out while she ran to get it fixed. Reading the description of the bags & that your daughter laughed upon finding out they were dog poop bags immediately tells me your wife is overreacting.  Tbh, I think some of the other parents would find it funny if they knew. It’s totally a dad goof, IMO. 

I hope things blow over with your wife. 🙂"
