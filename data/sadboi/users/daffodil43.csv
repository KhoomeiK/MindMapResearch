I moved out of home when my dog was about 12. I have huge regrets about not taking her with me, but like you, I couldn’t, I was too scared. My mother wouldn’t have liked that one teeny bit.

My dog sadly passed away a year later. It was so painful and to top it off I have suspicions my mother killed her (fed her paracetamol). 

To this day I cannot shake the regret. 

I now have my own dog, and I give every bit of my love to him. I constantly think of my previous dog and I truly believe she knew that mother was the evil one and she knew I loved her.

Try & distance yourself, who cares if you don’t drive? If you can still get about, it really doesn’t matter. So many people don’t drive and that doesn’t make them who they are, it’s just a part of them.

And your weight, as long as *you* are happy that’s all that matters.

PwBPD will always overlook the good stuff. They do not like it when you are showing signs of growth and independence. They want to be able to control and manipulate you to get what *they* want. 

Just keep in your mind to distance yourself. Try not to share so much info, good or bad. Unfortunately, it’s unlikely she will ever change. So you need to put yourself first before anyone else."

I know it’s not easy but you need to breathe. Do some deep breathing.

Grab something to eat. I can’t believe how much this one has helped me, when we panic our body goes into “fight or flight” so the last thing we would do if we were in danger is eat. So eat. It tells your body that you’re not in danger. 

Try to do some mindfulness, ground yourself. What can you see? Look at all the details, every tiny bit. What can you hear? Really appreciate all your senses.

Cold compression, or just put your face in cold water. Sounds bizarre, but my therapist said that when submerged in cold water, our heart slows way down.

I’m NC with my uBPD mother and I still remember the anxiety she used to make me feel, the disgust, the fact she loved my brother more than me... all of these things I couldn’t tell you a scenario, my brain seems to have wiped them all away. But you still remember the feelings.

I hope this helps! Always believe in yourself, because this is what they like, when you doubt yourself. Never give up."
raisedbyborderlines,fgvcfme,t3_f0jfuk,1581144437.0,"Omg why do they always throw the “I wish you all the best” comment!?

My uBPD mother put this in every single aggressive text."
raisedbyborderlines,fgs0vqe,t3_ezywur,1581065857.0,"And it’s crazy how normal I thought this was.

I thought it was normal to help my parents out with money, I had to buy a washing machine, a dishwasher... they never asked. But I felt obliged and at the time, I thought I was being a good, helpful daughter. I was always told “we have no money” and I would worry. 

I cleaned the house... I did it to help out but it was then expected of me to clean the house weekly. When I stopped I used to get comments like “Where is my cleaning fairy?” Uhhh mum... I’ve moved out and got my own house. No chance am I coming to yours just to clean it. Clean it yourself. 

This scares me writing this because I imagine when I have children, I would NEVER make them worry about money... and yes they could have little chores of cleaning but no way be expected to clean the house every week."
raisedbyborderlines,fgs0cjs,t3_f00ptn,1581065116.0,"It honestly does get better, the guilt slowly gets less and less.

You do not have to deal with this. The pointing & blaming, the ‘I love you, your my daughter’.

I posted recently and someone mentioned control. People with BPD cannot stand losing control. They definitely go on this rollercoaster of emotions in order to get their control over you back. They will be horrible, they will go silent, they will rage, they will go waify. The cycle just repeats and repeats. If you stay strong, which I know you can! You can sit back and watch the cycle go round and round.

Since going NC with my uBPD mother, I realise how much of my ‘space’ was taken by her, every thought, every action, every decision... all around my mother. I feel that when you go NC, you go through the healing process and you feel guilty, not only because they have trained you that way, but you have this ‘space’ all this time that is consumed by them that you start feeling sad because what is there to fill it? Nothing but guilt and sadness but once you realise the damage that a person with BPD does, you’ll slowly heal & realise how glad you are that you finally don’t have them in your life! That ‘space’ will be filled by other things, be it a hobby, or meditation, cooking... whatever it is. You’ll realise how much mental energy and time they stole. 

Keep being strong, your children will understand when they are older & will be so grateful you kept them safe."
raisedbyborderlines,fgqpg66,t3_ezy9qh,1581028734.0,"I’d love to know too!! 

I cannot make decisions at all, from small ones to big ones. Always uncertain if I do choose a decision that I’ve made the wrong one.

Speaking with my therapist, she did say that it’s important to be happy. So, when I make decisions I try to think “am I *happy* doing this?” And I try to think “am I doing this because *I want to* or am I putting pressure on myself?”

My decisions are always focused around others, I’m constantly fearful of letting others down, or not being ‘enough’. So my therapist is helping me to see that it really doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks. I find it really useful to keep saying that to myself too, which helps with decision making. 

I wish I could give more advice!"
raisedbyborderlines,fgpxwhi,t1_fgoncl7,1581014113.0,Thank you! Your comment means a lot!
raisedbyborderlines,fgoith6,t1_fgo28zr,1580971541.0,"No I completely agree with you, it is something she would do! 

But I had my cctv installed after NC. They were installed purely because I’m petrified. They are very subtle.

I don’t believe she knows they are there. But like you say, it is possible the waif in her comes out because she knows the cameras are there!"
raisedbyborderlines,fgoilip,t1_fgnndus,1580971302.0,"Definitely, i have reported it to police."

raisedbyborderlines,fgmq6x5,t1_fgmjg6r,1580929814.0,"She’s got the invitation, she was given it way before NC. She keeps speaking to my dad, manipulating him, to find out about the wedding. So she needs to know she’s not invited anymore.

Thank you for your advice, I really appreciate it!"

raisedbyborderlines,fgm9hz0,t1_fgm6l73,1580920412.0,Thank you! I appreciate it!
raisedbyborderlines,fgm9h0i,t1_fgm6bx2,1580920398.0,"This is the problem, I wrote to her first of all, explaining that she needs to get help and want the help for herself. My brother and I can no longer help her anymore.

We left it so that the door was open if that makes sense because back then we weren’t sure what was going to happen, we didn’t know she had uBPD. 

Now we are more aware and healing ourselves she’s tried numerous things to get us back.

I know that she’s losing it because she’s not in control.

I will be sending her a letter to explain she is uninvited to my wedding. Perhaps in there I can put something about not wanting any further contact.

I will chat with my brother and partner about the best way! 

Thank you!"
raisedbyborderlines,fgm93av,t1_fgm66bm,1580920206.0,Thank you!
raisedbyborderlines,fgm9213,t1_fgm5ecw,1580920189.0,"Thank you, that’s really useful though as I will definitely consider writing something like that.

I already have to write her a letter to say she’s uninvited from my wedding (I will get my partner to write it so that I’m not breaking NC) so I think in there I will write something like what you have said.

Thank you for your comment!"
raisedbyborderlines,fgm8tuu,t1_fgm5821,1580920079.0,"Thank you for the advice, going to chat to my partner about it and see where to go from."
raisedbyborderlines,fgm8r55,t1_fgm4dyv,1580920045.0,"Same!! If I had to talk to her I would honestly be physically sick, the thought of her like you say gives me complete shivers.

We have been NC for 7 months but I already new she wasn’t coming to my wedding about 2 months in. 

There is honestly nothing that will change my mind, she is not coming and that is it!"
raisedbyborderlines,fgm8k33,t1_fgm3o3f,1580919951.0,"Thank you, you’re right. I will have a chat with my partner and see if we should report what’s happened today! Thank you for your comment, I appreciate it!"

raisedbyborderlines,fglvmtz,t1_fglv12z,1580912023.0,"I am going to send her a letter soon, well from my partner, as I’m not breaking NC. It will say she’s not invited to my wedding anymore.

And I will put in there about respecting NC. If she continues to keep stepping on my boundaries then I’ll have to phone the police.. I’m not having her make me feel unsafe in my own home."
raisedbyborderlines,fglvhdy,t1_fglv61t,1580911916.0,"Wow you are right!! I never thought of it like that. I think she is going to explode soon, she’s not in control of anything and that’s a first... who knows what’s going to happen.

Definitely staying NC. Thanks for your comment!"
