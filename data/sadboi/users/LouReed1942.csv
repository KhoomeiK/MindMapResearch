Thanks for your response. I think you are right. 

One way I wrap my head around this behavior is that the motivation is about a desire for total power and control. I personally view this through the lens of domestic/partner/child abuse: in order to fulfill their desire for power and control, the abuser exploits cultural attitudes about filial piety in order to gaslight their victim into accepting the abuse.

So in this way, I see a commonality between both men and women--the psychological harm done by abusive parents--and thus a key to our complementary self-liberation."

I suggested we sit down on a sofa, as it would be more comfortable than standing. I made sure she had something to drink, and tissues for her nose and face, and I held her hand while leading her to a more comfortable space.

You said
> Every time I have tried calling out a creep, or interrupting a guy who’s telling a creepy story or making an awful joke, they’ve either ignored me completely because they don’t give a fuck what I think, declare my opinion worthless because I’m “not a real man” or one time squared up to physically fight me. They don’t give a fuck about the opinions of men they deem as “lesser”. They believe in a heirarchy in which the more you embody toxic masculinity, the more power you deserve. So my “failure” to perform toxic masculinity to their satisfaction puts me lower than them in the power heirarchy. Thus they feel entitled to disregard my opinion and harass me. 

So, this is the experience of speaking to white cis men in general. Toxic masculinity and misogyny define the battle of the sexes. 

Imagine what you've just said you have felt, but what it's like for any woman who talks to those shitty guys... and how race plays into that as well... you can appreciate how large the disparity is from that viewpoint.

I don't mean to say that you should do such and such activity in response to toxic masculinity. I think it comes down to character... whatever strength you have, it feels better to know you did your best when you are faced with a shitty social situation. That's my opinion only!!

> How the fuck am I supposed to respond to this shit?

We all have to figure this out. I sincerely just hope you put your heart and guts into the lifelong work of somehow always speaking up, always saying something in the moment, always trying to show people with these ideas that you in fact don't agree with them. Something like that.

> Pretty much the only way to earn their respect is to be like them.

There are so many of us out there who don't give a fuck about male acceptance. There are even guys who do this, masculine guys, macho guys, girlish guys, and more. Girls who don't give af are usually easy to spot because they're super cool, lol!

I would just ask you, ease up on the anxiety about how to perform. I personally hope that honest men speak out when other men they may even know are said to have been abusive. It's really that simple. For the vast majority of cases, if someone says they were abused, they are stating the truth.

My advice might sound overly simplistic, but I offer it in sincerity: wear great, supportive bras that make you feel comfortable. Your parents might not be capable of helping you do this. You might have to do it on your own. You're going to need help... even if it is a saleslady at the Kohl's! Even if you have to make 3 trips until you finally get a few bras that work for you!

It totally sucks, but for most people, our bodies continue to change until we are at least in our mid-20's. That means that you want to time any concepts of surgery to a point where your body isn't going to continue to change much after a reduction. 

I'm now 37, and I still consider having a breast reduction surgery. It's totally normal and many people consider it. 

But because you are in your teenage years, I want to offer you a deeper, more challenging form of advice: learn to love your body as it is. 

If you find yourself judging busty women and girls, take a moment to realize what you are doing. Take a deep breath and a step back. When we judge other women, it always comes back to a point of negative judgement within ourselves. That's what really hurts in the long term--much more than disliking your body.

You may start to notice that you can have control over your body with exercise and changing what you eat. Please be careful to learn about eating disorders and take that information seriously. If you really dislike your body, it can lead you to harming yourself. Yes, we can change our bodies to a degree. But at the same time we have to respect who we are--C cup and all--to make sure that we aren't disconnecting ourselves from being present in our bodies.

Having a positive, loving view of your own body is one of the secrets to health and happiness. Personally, I think it's a skill that should be actively taught to young people because it is something you are going to deal with for your entire life. MUCH better to get to a point where you can say, ""you know what, I wouldn't have chosen these breasts if I could have. But, they are a part of my own body, and I accept and love my body because it's how I feel the experience of being alive.""
