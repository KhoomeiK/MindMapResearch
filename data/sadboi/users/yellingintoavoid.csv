EDAnonymous,fm3yeex,t3_fsrkyt,1585741351.0,"i agree with you and the person above a lot! i think some of the content is geared towards ED recovery. a lot of the fatlogic people, from my experience put a lot on thinness. i.e. i once heard a guy say being thin was the most attractive (thin, not healthy) and people w anorexia are always underweight. i see it sometimes and to me its obvious they dont do their research and spread a lot of misinformation. ive always wondered if im too sensitive to these things just because i have an ed and so my view is warped. like when he said thin it just kind of idk 'inspired' me. antidiet i disagree w HAES because underweight is a size, it is not that healthy and in general obesity is a serious issue. but there are people with BED and mental health is never simple. sorry if this is rambly haha i just think we should put health first instead of aesthetic"

EDAnonymous,flxq4x5,t3_frtb6z,1585587712.0,"* DO NOT BRUSH YOUR TEETH IMMEDIATELY AFTER PURGING, stomach acid is very harsh and brushing straight after purging can damage your teeth. swish water instead and drink some vitamin water/fruit juice/ etc., to replace electrolytes
* keep a protein bar or something everywhere you go if you restrict/fast etc., if you fast for too long you can go into a hypoglycemic episode, this means your blood pressure is really low, you can faint or even die. get some sugar (NOT diet soda, electrolytes, etc., i keep cliff bars just in case)
* god forbid you have a heart attack but if you do, cough deeply and vigorously, taking a deep breath before each cough. call 911 (or whatever the emergency number for your country is) while you can
* if you purge, wash your hands before and after (esp with COVID-19 around, wash your hands)
* idk if it really counts but if you drink green tea, but do not like green tea bc of its bitterness here r some tips: dont pour boiling water on green tea leaves, they are delicate and burn easy; dont steep for too long or this can make it bitter as well"
