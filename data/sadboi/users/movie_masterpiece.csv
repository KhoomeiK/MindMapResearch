Also, Penner in case you're reading this: My family went through a tough time recently and one of the few things we had to distract ourselves was Survivor, which we have always watched together. We got to Cook Islands and every once in a while you would pop up on screen and deliver one of your iconic narration monologues which would never fail to make us laugh. For a few moments, it seemed like everything was back to normal, and I'll always be thankful for that.
