I live in Vancouver where he was shooting Smallville at the time. Anyway, as my friends and I were heading into the theater after just buying tickets, I saw a guy that looked just like him but he was wearing a shitty red-haired wig. We made eye contact and I pointed to the poster of the movie we were headed into and gave him a smile. He laughed and then did that shushing gesture with a finger to his lips. I wasn't sure if that was the screening he had just come out of, but I've always liked to think he had just been watching his movie."

dataisbeautiful,fjuofwt,t1_fjsxnsj,1583618601.0,"He's not wrong about premiums in some provinces. I live in BC and we have to pay monthly MSP based on your income. I believe the top end is about $72 a month (or it was 5 years ago when I worked full time and was part of the top income bracket; now I'm on disability and pay nothing). Most of the time, your employer takes care of paying your premium every month along with whatever extended health benefits they offer you, so you might not realize it's coming out of your paycheque. 

Other provinces, like Alberta, don't have to pay MSP premiums. Next year, I believe, BC is getting rid of the premiums for everyone though."
