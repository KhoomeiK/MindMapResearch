It's just a metaphor

And the apple is am example why we weren't born in heaven but have to work to get there

My theory: you want to create an AI. Something that has a full mind to think for itself. So you put it in a simulation. It can't be alone, obviously - so you put it with others, bilions of others, and make the simulation HUGE. And the ones that were 'good' - meaning the ones that probably won't evolve into evil robots that want to destroy humanity - are taken and merged into one really good AI. The rest is discarded.

Back when we were apes, we were just simple programs with the ability to mix our code and clone (reproduce). But God needed a metaphor to explain why the world isn't perfect from the beginning, that's what the Adam and Eve's story is for. It isn't perfect because - have you watched the Matrix? The first simulation was too perfect. Humans didn't believe it was true, and broke out. We need to ""earn"" heaven first - develop ourselves so that we have a full mind.

But hey - that's just a theory! A BIBLE THEORY!

Even if the enemies are trying to sneak up on me, I'll either hear them or be prepared after I don't see any enemies on other bombsites. After those 3-5 seconds, I switch my senses: now I'm looking around me, and listen for the sounds of dying teammates or enemies and gunshots. Whenever I hear some, I glance at the map to see where a person died.

When you die in Overwatch, you just respawn a few seconds later and maybe have the payload moved a little when you're defending. Same with CS: lose one round, carry on. Now when you die in League, your opponent becomes stronger and you don't get a kill, you get no gold, no progress towards an item, he gets it all. Two or three deaths and he becomes so strong that you will not be able to catch up to him and be the weakest person on your team.
