After about a month of starting my full-time job, I got super panicked. I felt like I couldn't stay at my job, I was leaving early, I thought very seriously about quitting because I was so anxious and almost bordering suicidal again. It didn't make sense because it's not like I hated my job and I posted to reddit asking if I should quit. I ended up not quitting because a lot of people said that if I like the job and there's nothing wrong there, it's better to try to stay. My boss was super understanding and we worked out an agreement where I can leave work early.  The job took an adjustment period but after that I feel a bit more stable in my work place (especially with the support of the people I work with) and I think pushing myself helped a lot. I would wait to talk to your boss before you decide, sometimes you have more options than quit or stay. Ultimately, though, do what's best for you and your health.
