AskReddit,f2dvmee,t3_dcyu3x,1570166861.0,"I pulled my daughter out of school to homeschool when she was half way through 5th grade. The public schools in my city are garbage, most private schools are Catholic and the rest are more focused on money. The first school she attended was 5600 a year, the second was 10k a year. She is so far behind its mind blowing! We cover math, social studies, science, reading, spelling and grammar in about 2-3 hrs vs the 6 hrs of bullshit they were doing in school. She is flying through her work and learning so much now that she actually has an opportunity to learn. I'm atheist and her father is non practicing Christian. Religion does not play a role in homeschooling for us. She attends art classes at a local museum, goes to parks/playgrounds, hangs out with friends which she made outside of school, spends way too much time on YouTube and Minecraft....pretty normal stuff."
