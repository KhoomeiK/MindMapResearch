It *does* get better. I've been struggling with self harm for about 4 or 5 years now, and am currently 7 months clean. While I still deal with self harm ideation, the urges to go thru with it have become weaker with time. I know it can be so hard to deal with these urges but I hella believe in you. And I'm proud of you for reaching out here and asking for help. I'm sending you all the love and moral support"
