You’re cute sis, you have a facial structure similar to Kelly Rowland, which is good bc you can see how she does her makeup & do similar styles. I think you’re naturally pretty, but i know how it feels to feel frumpier than other black girls, or less “girly”. Makeup & hair aren’t one size fits all, you gotta figure out what works for you. Your skin isn’t bad, but it could be worked on. You look like you need to drink more water, and get on a routine of exfoliating & toning. I know you’re doing protective styles w/ your hair which is really good & healthy, but those twists aren’t the perfect look for you. I think having them hanging is taking away from your pretty face. The best pic you posted was the one in the bonnet. I think smaller twists or even a diff protective style (braids, twist out, extensions) would be really pretty. Eyebrows, just go on YouTube to figure out. They have a pretty good shape, so you most likely would only need to be trimming them & filling them a tiny bit. Hope this all helps"

Then when my manager tried to come help he screamed at her & called her a bitch for inter fearing w/ destiny until security removed him. I was 18, it was my first job. My dad had to walk me to my car at night after that. 

Job after that-an office, everyone mostly professional until after I stopped working there. My old boss started texting all the time to “party with him”, & always asking if I had broken up w/ my boyfriend. I realized he was stalking me around the Internet (watching my fb & IG stories even though they weren’t under my real name & he didn’t follow me, looking my LinkedIn everyday) I was 19, he was 39 and married with children. 

Job after that, giant corporate office, old boys club, lots of high earning men in upper management. That was just constant little comments here & there about my boobs or my ass, that I was expected to take as a compliment and laugh off. Or guys would have “private convos” about me, right next to me about how they’d have a good time w/ me. 

Another corporate job had a maintenance guy always staring at me, stopping what he was doing to watch me, trying to be alone w/ me places. I heard he cornered another woman when she was drunk after a Xmas party & tried to grope her.
