Otherwise according to Boomers every millennial is a little kid. Just because they're annoying, and just because they're younger than you, doesn't make them a little kid. Also, you interacted with one kid online. That one kid doesn't represent every 13 year old, and people already act way different online than the do in real life. 

Also, also, 10 year olds don't cry that often so I don't know why you're trying to even compare him to a 10 year old. 6 year olds cry and have temper tantrums. Not 10 year olds. He was raging to an online game, which even adults do now and then. Still not a little kid.

Also, also, also, you literally proved my point lol. A one year old can't speak but a four year old can. Which shows that despite the three years, there's a big difference in them, both physically and developmentally. There's a big difference in a 10 year old and a 13 year old too."
Advice,fqj3r9w,t1_fqj0v78,1589404640.0,"Uh, no. A 10 year old and a 13 year old is a huge difference. Puberty between the ages of like 10 and 14 are usually when kids mature the fastest, and by like 16 it slows down a bit (don't quote me on that I'm not a doctor lol). Hell, a 10 year old is barely even a little kid, most kids have started puberty by then. 

But like what kind of world do you live in where you think a 10 year old and a 13 year old are the same? That's like trying to compare a one year old to a four year old. A ton of rapid growth happens during both those age gaps."

I'm not looking for people to fix my problems, I'm looking for help with it. I don't know what the heck I'm supposed to do. I'm not a child, but I'm not an adult either. I get I'm supposed to be independent but like, I'm not even old enough to drive yet. Why am I expected to figure out my entire life, or at least a good portion of it, without any help? Or if I'm not expected, why is nobody helping me out? I'm trying my best but like I said you can't just shove something in someone's face that they've never seen before and expect them to be an expert at it without guidance along the way. My entire life, albeit short, has been like that. I'm just thrown into situations I don't know how to deal with, and then everyone gets pissed of when I'm not good at it, or don't agree with the decisions I make. For example, every time I've gone to my father with a problem, I get told ""I don't know/care you figure it out."" But, he's an asshole anyways so I don't pay him much mind. But that's honestly how I feel like my life is. My life is that phrase personified. 

This post, in addition to all my other stupid posts is a cry for help because I don't know what to do, or rather how to do it. I'm told to be responsible or I dunno get my life together-- shit like that. But like, how am I supposed to do something that I don't know how to do?"

Well I don't know what the hell to do, and nobody is helping me with that either. ""Change your habits and your mindset"" okay, great. How the fuck am I supposed to do that?

When you're depressed, sometimes there is no happiness. If you're going to kill yourself, why worry about something that isn't there? Worry about what you're leaving behind.

Yes, it takes extra effort. But in the end it could be worth it. You're not ""pleasing"" everyone. You're being a human being with empathy and someone who understands how hard it is or would be to lose somebody. None the less to suicide.

When you commit suicide, for the rest of their lives, they'll live with guilt. They'll be asking why. ""Why did you do this? Why didn't I see it sooner? Is it my fault? I could have done something to prevent this. Why didn't you say something? Why didn't I say something?"" And quite frankly, that's just not something people want to leave behind. It's not fair for someone to feel guilty over something that's not your fault. They may live with so much guilt that one day _they_ kill themselves too.

depression,fjjovil,t1_fjj0swy,1583406751.0,"I do go. School makes things worse it stresses me out too much. Somehow even more than my parents, which quite frankly shouldn't be possible for as much as they already do. Literally every day I go to school I want to kill myself, and sometimes almost do. I have panic attacks every day, and am on the verge of one right now. At school all I do is sleep and cut myself in the bathroom at this point cause like I've given up. On myself, on everyone else, and on life. Nobody wants to help me, everyone thinks I'm either an idiot or lazy. Or both.

Fucking Christ you would not believe the amount of times I've been called retarded. As in the neurotypical slur for a mentally challenged person. _That_ kind of retarded. I sure love to go to school just to come back home and be called retarded for trying my best! :)"
depression,fjjonnn,t1_fjjap3x,1583406477.0,"Yeah, that's the freaking thing. I'm trying to do better. They don't even bother to help me. All they do is scream at me all day. They don't believe depression is anything more than a phase, especially my dad. They think it's just teenage angst and it's the stupidest thing ever. 

Like, how am I supposed to be doing better at school when every single night I have panic attacks? I go to school sleep deprived, and having too much anxiety in class to even bother to focus. For every single class, and I seriously can't remember anything when I get home because I'm so freaking tired. I could _maybe_ tell you what I had for lunch today, and that's it. I get home, try to start homework, and fall asleep because I'm so tired. I wake up at like 4 AM even though I actually got sleep, now my homework isn't done. It's a never ending fucking cycle of always being tired. But you know what? Anxiety is a choice. I'm choosing to stay up all night. Yeah. It's _my_ fault."
depression,fjiqmi3,t3_fdlehk,1583373517.0,"Yeah. Teachers rarely give a shit. There are a few that care, and you're lucky if you get one because damn are they scarce. One time my teacher asked me why I was failing the class, and I said that I was stressed, and she cut me off before I could finish and was like ""wELL iF yoU tUrN iN YOur wOrK iN mY cLaSS yoU woUlDnT be sTrEssed.""

Yeah, let's just completely disregard any other classes I have, anything going on at home, and any mental health issues I may be having. It's my fault for my stress. If only I had turned in that damned homework. All my problems would magically dissapear. 

I think I legitimately had to hold back laughter when she said that. Laughter from disbelief of her and her ignorance.

By the way, where do you live? What country? When we get essays back where I live we have numbers on them, which then covert into letters. A to F, but we skip E."
depression,fjipu84,t3_fdmpe1,1583373023.0,"Yep. I can 100% relate to everything you said. Literally. Every. Single. Part.

Legit if I could take everyone's highschool struggles and put it all on me, just so nobody would ever have to go through stuff like this again, I would. School is Hell."

My family and I are too poor to afford a real VR headset so today I found my old off-brand Google cardboard and used YouTube's VR mode and some Wii remotes to pretend like I was playing. It was fun. Really fun. But now the high is over and I'm coming back down and I hate everything again. The high was fun while it lasted I guess. :(

To be honest, I liked it when I believed no one cared. It gave me an excuse for why nobody ever helped me as a kid. Now I know they do care, but don't believe my pain enough to think it's an actual issue. They assume it's a phase. Somehow that hurts me even more."
depression,fizdhg2,t1_fixnsfe,1582860074.0,"Yeah I have something like that too, but my trigger is verbal.

You could ask what I had today for lunch at school, and I'd be on the verge of a panic attack. I hate it."
depression,fizcbcu,t1_fiz8hog,1582859257.0,"That's the kicker. I'm doing all of this. Staying up until 1 AM, never having any down time, constantly having stress headaches and being sleep deprived, all for a D. A freaking D. I'm barely passing, and if I did any less than this I would be failing. No ifs, ands, or buts. You had a lot a friends, or at least a few. And that's good. Or, was. I'm sorry to hear what's happened. I never had any, and honestly still don't. I'm drifting further and further away from them. They were hardly even friends to begin with, and they're all moving away next year anyways. I've struggled to make friends ever since middle school. For five years. I'm not making any friends here. It's useless, it's pointless to even try to hope. School is not the kind of environment where I can make friends, nor is it the kind of environment where I can even function. 

Believe me, I want to stay in school. Who wants to hire a highschool drop out? Nobody. But at the same time I can't take this any more. School IS my problems. It causes them. It creates them. It enhances my social anxiety. I'm too tired to bother to shower anymore. I'm always exhausted because of the work. I don't have time to eat anything anymore. As I type this, I am in literal excruciating pain right now, a stress/sleep deprivation headache. Only happens on the nights I get 4 or less hours of sleep. On a scale of 1 to 10, it's a 9. These are nearly weekly and only getting worse. Normal people in this kind of pain are told to avoid any triggers and are given pain medicine. 

Where's my pain medicine? I want it. I'm tired of all of this. 

I value my social life (or lack thereof), but I value my health even more. Being in this kind of pain, not eating, running every day on 5 hours of sleep, all while being miserable... It's not healthy. A potential friend will always be out there somewhere. Sanity will not."

School takes up my free time, to the point where I have none, and on the weekends I'm over sleeping to compensate for the sleep lost during the week. I can't hang out any more, and I'm not able to catch up with current events. I only relate to people on a superficial level, we only talk about school. Nothing more than aquatintences. I don't have anything in common with anyone anymore. Not anyone my age, anyways. I have hobbies and interests but can't pursue them because of school. It's like I'm perpetually living under this boring pathetic rock. Even with my social anxiety I still like to go out to places, occasionally meet someone, but I can't even do that anymore. I can't make friends and are slowly losing the very few I had."
