BPD,fpu8l6l,t3_gfd6z9,1588907041.0,"I’ve felt similarly. I’m getting paid still so that’s not as much of a concern (I could be making more though and my plan to move out this year probably isn’t happening anymore). Quarantine has given me freedom to do several things, try new hobbies, get chores done, and work on things without having outside life obligations getting in the way. I’m used to isolating a decent amount, so it isn’t super different from me. I do miss my friends though cause and some activities, and work actually. But I am content for the most part. My quarantine has kind of ended because work has started up again a little. So we’ll see how the transition goes. But I’ve been enjoying quarantine too, it’s not just you. It can be freeing to people in the right circumstances. Don’t feel guilty, your feelings are valid."

relationship_advice,fpdte5p,t1_fpdr92p,1588533849.0,"The problem is you don’t seem to understand what rape is, so in a way you are appropriating it even if it’s not your intention. It doesn’t matter if you’re in a relationship or how long you’ve been together, you can be married and it is still rape if someone doesn’t stop when you tell them to. No matter the gender, age, relationship status. If you don’t stop sex when someone says stop it is rape. And you don’t have to explicitly say “stop” you can say no, take a break, hold on, a million different things. Any type of revoking consent means you stop, or it becomes rape. The lines are very clearly drawn with rape. If consent is not given or if consent is taken away in any manner, it’s rape. End of story. 

Also, drunk people can’t legally give consent and no response is not consent and coerced consent is not consent."

You can stop stewing, because you’ll know. Maybe he’s struggling with understanding, maybe he’s doing it accidentally and doesn’t even notice. You won’t know unless you ask. I’ve said I love you to my boyfriend since month 2 of our relationship. It’s been 2 and a half years now and he still hasn’t said it and you bet your ass I stewed over that the entire time and it drove me insane. We finally actually talked about it and apparently he sees love differently than I do. He sees it as a commitment like getting engaged, and he’s not ready for that. I’m not either, getting engaged wise, or even moving in, we’re not ready. But he sees love differently. I say it to my friends, I have so much love to give, but he’s not like that and now I understand. And we have an agreement I can keep saying it because I need to express it, and he knows I won’t expect it back so he can enjoy it without guilt. But I wouldn’t have known if we didn’t talk about it. We had several conversations actually, to get to this understanding, but I have such a sense of peace now because I know why. I know he loves me, but he’s not ready to say it and I’m ok with that. I see love in the way he acts. My emotional mind is soothed because it doesn’t have to constantly wonder anymore."

For a while I was working hard on being better, but I think part of it was trying to convince my boyfriend I was better and we should get back together. We did, but in the time we weren’t talking I don’t think I had an FP, but it was very lonely. Some of the things I worked on did stick, but some didn’t. Regardless I’m still leagues ahead of how I’d ever been before. But I think if I’m ever in a relationships they’ll always be my FP. Do you think it can be natural, for your partner to be your FP? I feel like even normal people have their partner as their unofficial FP."

And I know he loves me, even if he doesn’t say it. You don’t stay with someone after they attempt if you don’t love them.  So really every time I wonder why he hasn’t responded for a while, I’m like he’s probably napping. He likes naps. And he has a lot of schoolwork, or when he’s at work he can’t really talk. My obsessive thoughts still keep coming, maybe a bit less, I just got better at dismissing them. Like oh boy, my brains being a dick again. No he’s not ignoring you he’s just doing x, y, or z.

BPD,fnnbbsg,t1_fnn9qhe,1587088514.0,"Yes, it’s often a huge part of BPD. You might’ve heard of “splitting” before, it’s the same thing. Our brains are very all or nothing, partly because we tend to go to extremes for everything. So we meet a new person and they can be great maybe our new BFF and then we learn about something bad about them or a thing they did and suddenly all of that good is invalidated and they’re on our permanent shit list. Personally black and white thinking is incredibly pervasive for me, it leaks into everything. Even situations, I can never see gray areas. I can try to think between two extremes and make a gray area, but most of the time I literally can’t do it. Then my therapist will go “well how about x gray area” and it’s like a magic trick how she seemingly pulls this gray area out of nowhere. And I’ll be like oh wow that makes a lot of sense that’s better, but couldn’t come up with it myself. It’s a self defense mechanism we developed to try and protect ourselves. If we already hate the thing it can’t hurt us. 

To quote the second diagnostic criteria for BPD from the DSM: “A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by extremes between idealization and devaluation (also known as ""splitting"")”  .

BPD,fnjhxsy,t1_fnjaznk,1586999328.0,"Crap I’m an INFJ, I didn’t know that and hope it’s not true xD. There’s definitely connection between our personalities and our disorders. The point I was trying to make is that personalities don’t cause it, and the illness doesn’t define your personality. I’m a sensitive person too. My brother and I went through the same circumstances but he came out absolutely fine because things don’t affect him as much. But me being sensitive isn’t what’s most responsible for my BPD. The abuse and emotional neglect with how I was raised, and other circumstances led me to have BPD more than any part of my personality. So yea there’s connection, but it doesn’t condemn who you are."
BPD,fnjh1cp,t3_g1u1qb,1586998806.0,"I understand. I’ve been there, I know all of those feelings. I know it’s hard to think about this right now, but it’s not you. It is NOT you. It’s them. Sometimes breakups happen and they don’t give you a reason why they fell out of love. Sometimes they don’t even know. But it’s them, it’s their problems or feelings. And as for your current relationship, you NEED to talk to them about this. Communication is the single most important thing in a relationship with a BPD person. Unfortunately it’s also usually very hard. You need to tell him how your feeling. Ask what’s going on. Being in this uncertain state of limbo is giving you so much stress and you see the toll it takes. My current relationship is the healthiest I’ve ever had. My boyfriend and I learned together how to communicate and have an actual healthy relationship. Sometimes when I need to talk to him about something but I’m nervous, I’ll sit there and open and close my mouth for like 10 minutes until I can shove the words out. He understands, he knows what I’m doing, and he waits patiently for me to be able to say it. And then we talk. And a really helpful mindset we’re in is it’s us against the problem. Not me vs him, us vs the problem. Sometimes communication gets tangled and we have to step back and explain, but we talk about it. I don’t have to sit in uncertain terror, constantly afraid we’re going to break up anymore. Two and a half years has gotten me to a place where when we have a problem, I think “okay, we need to talk about it” instead of “this is how it ends”. We’ve been through some pretty traumatic shit together, and we’re not breaking up for anything that doesn’t deserve it. If we break up, it’ll be for a damn good reason. But whatever it is, you need to talk. You need to tell them your feelings and where you’re at so they can respond, because they can’t read your mind. 

TL;DR- You need to communicate. It’s the most vital thing in a relationship. Yea, it’s hard and scary to talk, but you have to."

BPD,fnbl3ya,t1_fn4otik,1586817456.0,"Yea FPs can be dangerous sometimes because your mood can be based on theirs, and that gives them a control that can be devastating. Learning to separate your feelings/issues from theirs is vital."

The thing about trauma is that it’s subjective. What’s traumatic to one person doesn’t affect another. That’s why siblings from the same circumstances don’t have the same diagnoses. My brother is fine, 0 mental illnesses, while I have 10. That genetics theory, like how some people are just born more sensitive than others, definitely has some merit. He just adapted better than I did. This isn’t the trauma olympics though, and it’s hurtful to pit traumas against each other. Yours, whatever it is, is valid."

But a lot of this isn’t your fault. You didn’t choose for your brain to develop this way. You didn’t choose these distorted thinking patterns or mood instability or fear of abandonment. You know why I think you’re a good person? Because you want to be better. Bad people don’t want to be better. Bad people think they’re fine when they’re not. 

And this isn’t making excuses. These are reasons. The difference is responsibility. Excuses take no responsibility while reasons take responsibility and explain. 

This self awareness you have is amazing. It will be a really valuable tool. Try to see a therapist that specializes in BPD so they know how to treat your problems best. As long as you’re honest with yourself and aware, you will improve <3"

I started collecting all these bits of me, like puzzle pieces, and fitting them together to make a picture. Like I’m kind and funny and hardworking. I’m an INFJ, an empath, and an ambivert. It takes time to really feel identity, but you can get there. 

On jobs and educations, start with something you love. There’s gotta be something you love ;) I liked cooking. I liked that I was good at it and it made other people happy. That’s how I got started in culinary. Maybe you like art, there’s a gazillion ways that could go. Maybe you’re really good at puzzles, something like engineering or mechanics.

You can learn to cope with it and correct though patterns and behaviors, enough that you can reduce your diagnostic criteria to the point where you technically don’t meet them, but some of them will never go away, and you’ll be coping with them for your entire life. The abandonment issues, for example. If you have that, it will never be cured. But you can learn to manage it to the point where it’s not a problem.

BPD,flaespt,t3_fn4zfz,1584982440.0,"I HATE when people try to say those with BPD are narcissists. It’s quite literally the opposite, we usually think we’re shit. We’re constantly seeking validation to prove to ourselves that we’re not shit. We’re not trying to prove to ourselves that we’re great, we’re just trying to prove that we’re not absolute garbage. BPD is often a collective clusterfuck of maladaptive coping. We developed ways to get our needs met when we were young, like “temper tantrums”, silent treatment, passive aggressiveness, so called “manipulative” behavior. They were all unconscious ways of meeting our needs. Unfortunately, they don’t work the same for grown ups as they did for kids, so now we often look immature. For me a lot of my therapy has been unlearning those inappropriate, unhealthy behaviors. 

TL;DR- BPD is pretty much the opposite of narcissism, we’re trying to prove we don’t suck, not that we’re awesome."

If you look up the part of the brain affected by BPD, you’ll see our amygdalas (responsible for emotion regulation) are very underdeveloped. We never learned emotional maturity, so we’re kind of stuck with the emotion regulation of a 12-year-old. This is also because those emotional reactions served us when we were younger, they got our needs met, so we kept those reactions, not knowing that they’re not acceptable for adults. They worked back then, but they don’t now, and it’s hard to learn to change a pattern you’ve had your whole life. 

If your family has a hard time understanding BPD (or any mental illness) I’ve found showing them the scientific facts helps. You can see a broken bone with a scan, and you can see brain abnormalities as well. There are studies and pictures of BPD brains out there, so they can see part of our brains aren’t developed, and it might help them understand that we’re not crazy and it’s not something wrong with our personality like the name suggests. It’s a legitimate, often misunderstood illness, with physical markers. 

Personally, I used this thing called Vital Tones, they have a sound wave treatment for BPD. Sounds sketchy, but it really worked for me, thoroughly enough that there’s no chance of it being a placebo. Listening to it helped strengthen my emotional regulation a lot. I still have moments but now they’re more situational than the constant BPD mood swing roller coaster. The first time I used it was right before I got pulled over for speeding for the first time. Instead of having a panic attack or crying, I was calmer and handled the interaction well. My parents jaws were literally dropped because I’d never reacted like that before and they were so confused as to how I wasn’t a sobbing mess. So yea, highly recommend for help with emotional regulation!"

BPD,fjle6lb,t3_fdpysp,1583445076.0,"Yea! It’s normal! Here’s some science about crying: your tears a basically excess emotions! There are several kinds of tears, including emotional. Emotional tears actually contain the excess emotion chemicals. When we get too much emotion, no matter what it is, our body can’t contain it so it cries it out! That’s why it’s always better to let yourself cry, your body is trying to help you out. That’s also why you might feel better after a good cry. It can be really difficult for BPD people seeing as we always have excess emotion. And it can be a struggle when we feel like it invalidates our emotion. Crying when you’re super fucking pissed can make it feel like your anger is weakened, when it’s actually the opposite. You’re so damn pissed you’ve sprung a leak, that much anger can’t fit inside! 
I’ve also had some frustrating experiences. I’ve had multiple emotions that don’t fit, one time I was angry but the anger thing was also kind of funny so I started laughing and crying while looking pissed. Freaked some people out, but I explained and they understood better. 
Hope this can help!"

EatCheapAndHealthy,fjf71gc,t3_fd2fd5,1583285665.0,"Canned French onion soup, toast a piece of bread, toss it in, shredded Swiss on top, boom actual French onion.  

Also I think they’re called Annie chun’s noodle bowls. You add hot water and they’re actually pretty good. 

Annie’s white cheddar shells just add actual white cheddar to it. 

Also a fettuccini Alfredo that’s not from a can, basically equal parts cream cheese, milk, Parmesan, and butter. Add some garlic and salt, nice and thick and comforting. 

Also there’s a lemon garlic seasoning (lemon garlic garni is what I get) but find a good seasoning salt and give flavor to random things. Microwave steam green beans, add lemon, evoo, and season salt they’re damn tasty. Plain pasta, butter, Parmesan, and the seasoning elevates it to flavortown."

My bro and I went through pretty much the same shit, he’s fine. 100% fine. I have tried and failed to find a mental illness he’s got. He’s fine. I have 10, I shit you not, 10 mental illnesses. I think I was born too sensitive or something like that, everything we went through hit me way harder than him. It is what it is, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t envy him just a little."
