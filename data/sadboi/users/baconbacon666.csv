These reactions tend to reveal a lot about the person’s heart and where they are at in life. I believe it's due to it being counter-intuitive to a ""psychological self-defense"" that some people put when they did something they're no longer proud of. As you mentioned it, ""I'm not responsible for doing XXX because God made me do it/ God washed it/ God's plan, etc. 

I've always loved the parable of the tree and it's fruits, because it intrinsically embodies the nature of a human life. I can't be a ""good man"" if I'm doing bad actions. I can't be an ""honest man"" if I'm tricking and deceiving others. I can't be a ""Virtuous man"" if I'm deliberately corrupting others. But this is only possible when we are accountable for our actions (fruits). And exactly here is where the true beauty of accountability resides: in the fact that we could be that other thing, we could do the bad and evil, but we decide not to do it, we chose virtue over corruption, good over evil, love over lust.

For moral, philosophical and spiritual reasons I took the decision at a very young age to refrain from sexual relationships until marriage, since I expect to receive exactly what I'm able to offer. In other words, I'm offering exactly what I'm asking for, since I believe is the fair thing to do.

I've been seeing for a virgin girl in real life with similar views, but unfortunately, it's been more difficult than I thought. So I thought ""why not online?"".

Long story short,  I'm basically a creep to [/r/Christianity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/) for refusing to engage in pre-marital sex and for choosing to wait until marriage. Also, I'm a ""beta"" for not accepting a woman with whatever her past may be. One guy even suggested that I should marry a prostitute so I could prove I'm a good Christian.
