BreakUps,f43flpu,t3_dj63yx,1571341461.0,I shared all my feelings and emotions with my ex after she left but it didnt help. I didnt feel any better and we still aren't together so it didnt fix anything between her and I either.
BreakUps,f3sryop,t1_f3sqduz,1571108039.0,I think ur right. Funny part is now she texts me that she really wants to be happy and that she wants the best for me.
depression,f3sg1gp,t1_evrl2ii,1571102248.0,It really doesn't help. What helped me was talking with family and friends who actually understand me and what I was going through.
BreakUps,f3sfrnl,t1_ewwiytv,1571102123.0,"It really is horrible but I'm doing a lot better now. I found a wonderful woman who treats me like I deserve and I couldnt be happier. Once my ex found out, she called me crying wanting me to take her back. I will always care about her but im done. What she did was despicable. Karma will come knocking on her door one day."
BreakUps,f3sexz0,t1_ey1igp5,1571101741.0,I have found a great woman. Been dating for a month now but it still hurts to see my ex. She wants me to be her friend but I can't do it. My mind has moved on but my heart still wants her to come back. Im hoping that one day the pain will subside so I can truly be happy.
BreakUps,f3sdxkx,t1_f3mgt13,1571101268.0,If u were truly in love then no it is not a good idea to try to be friends. I know first hand how that turns out and its not good.
BreakUps,exj62ie,t3_ct5fsi,1566342794.0,I wish I could cut off all contact but we have four kids together. Seeing her with her new bf when she picks them up is a nightmare I can't wake up from. All the pain comes flooding back in every time.
BreakUps,exgbjya,t3_csjqqk,1566259863.0,I have been in the same boat. We were together for 10 years. It's been a month and I have poured my heart out to her over and over again. One minute she tells me she misses me and still loves me and the next minute she acts like I never existed. It's hard to tell what will happen but I do believe that if u are meant to be with someone love will bring u back together. The only problem with that is how long it might take. Ur heart will move on from the pain eventually and u probably won't wanna take the chance of them ripping ur heart out again.
BreakUps,exgaqdu,t3_csk2fr,1566259295.0,Im the same way too. I hate being home cuz I can't forget all the time we shared here together. Ten years worth of good memories. I'm fine at work but I the only thing that keeps me from going insane at home is my kids. They are the only reason I haven't given up on life. She takes them every other weekend and for those 2 days I struggle to do anything.
BreakUps,ex92zou,t3_crj7vi,1566082712.0,I have realized that too but it still hurts so much. Living in this same house that we shared ten years of memories together is complete hell. Having kids together makes it so much worse. When I was younger and had break ups I never saw those girls again but having to see her every time she comes to pick up our kids is a never ending torture. She acts like I don't exist. Any advice anyone has would be appreciated. It's only been one month since she left but I just want and need this pain to end.
BreakUps,ewwabxi,t1_ewvl4em,1565824234.0,I'm in the exact same boat as u except it was 10 years and we have 4 kids. She is doing the exact same things to me that ur wife did to u. It takes a horrible human being to do something like this to someone. If u ever need someone to talk to I'm here. I'm still struggling as it has only been a month since she walked out so any advice on how to cope would be greatly appreciated.
BreakUps,eww9xec,t3_cq7lrr,1565823950.0,I was with my ex for 10 years. We have 4 kids together. She walked out on us a month ago. She jumped into a relationship with a guy just two days after leaving. At first she said she wanted for us to be friends and co parents. Now just yesterday she comes to my house crying telling me she misses me and gives me a big hug. Right after that she went back to his house and posted pictures of her and him holding each other and grinning from ear to ear. Idk why she said those things and hugged me.  She tore out my heart and crushed my soul. She only sees our kids one day a week and doesn't call to check on them or anything. Each day is a struggle to find the strength to keep going. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.
BreakUps,ew5ozyc,t3_cmurv2,1565141573.0,I just went through a bad breakup after 11 years together. Im one month into it now and each day is getting easier. Stay strong and work on urself. Do what makes u happy. In time u will be a stronger and better person than u ever thought u could be.
depression,evr8rq2,t3_ckmvf8,1564703328.0,I did it once but the guy i went to didn't seem to understand. He had me listening to the sound of rain and kept telling me to breathe deeply. It didn't do anything for my problems.
depression,evdtdis,t3_cjcntr,1564446985.0,U just have to have hope even when everything seems hopeless. It's hard but it's the only thing that keeps me going. I just went through a bad breakup after 11 years and we have 4 kids. I was bad off for the first 2 weeks. Couldn't eat or sleep. Didn't want to do anything but wallow in my own misery. I found that hoping for a better future works. I started working out and meeting new people. Now I'm a better man than I ever was before. Just keep hoping for whatever it is u want in life and drive urself towards ur goal. It's gonna suck but in time u will feel like there is nothing u can't do in this life. Wish u the best. U can do it.
depression,eu9nrrc,t1_eu4qg1g,1563585639.0,I saw her today. She came to the house. We sat and talked and she said that her brother new this guy who needed a roommate to help with rent and they are talking about dating but she is not sleeping with him. I told her that if she has no plan to come back and really loves this guy to take the rest of her things and i will never text or call her again. She reassured me that they arent having sex once again. Idk what to think. Is she lying? Is she just taking some time to herself? She has always been a stay at home mom while i worked. So maybe she just needs some space for a while. Its really messing with my mind.
depression,eu3ae2z,t1_eu00vm3,1563409475.0,It's ok she deserves harsh for what she is doing to our family. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if i didn't see her driving around town every day. The only way I can get through this is if she either comes back or moves away. I felt better this morning and had a good outlook on life. Then i passed her on my way to work and it all came crashing down on me. I cried for the rest of the ride.
BreakUps,eu390wr,t1_eu38g5o,1563408457.0,I felt better today until I passed her on my way to work. Then it all hit me again and cried the rest of the way.
BreakUps,eu3683y,t3_ceb8qn,1563406414.0,That's a nightmare dude. I am going through the same thing. My gf left me last week after 10 years together and she won't even speak to me. I have nightmares about her with other guys and barely sleep. I don't have all the answers but know that there are people here that feel ur pain. Just take it one day at a time. Hopefully it will get easier.
depression,etzsk95,t1_etz7yvt,1563336437.0,Ty It helps to have people to talk to who know what I'm going through.
depression,etzru7d,t1_etzoztw,1563336125.0,We never married. We both agreed that all we needed was to love each other and we didn't need a ring and a certificate to prove it. That and having a baby every 2 years was so expensive that we couldn't have been able to afford it even if we wanted to.
depression,etzoztw,t1_etx796a,1563334895.0,She was a good and loving person all the way up until about a month ago. She was a great mom and lived for our kids. That's why this is so confusing. I just can't figure out why she is doing this to us. Is she so in love with this guy that she is afraid he will get mad if she comes by? She is telling other people that she isnt with this guy he is just a roommate but other people have seen them out together and he had his hands all over her. I will never understand why it had to be like this. She could have talked to me and at least given me a reason and some closure.
depression,etznutw,t1_etz7yvt,1563334411.0,The only thing that is helping my mental state is just telling myself that this isn't the end and that one day she will regret it and apologize for what she has put me through. Until that day comes I will do my best to be a good father.
depression,etzmc0k,t1_etxkd21,1563333746.0,My parents are helping out by watching the kids when i'm working but talking to them is impossible. They are in their sixties now and have been together their whole lives so they can't relate at all. They just keep saying that i just need to suck it up and move on. Way easier said than done.
depression,etyswwz,t3_cds0g3,1563322259.0,"I sat my kids down and tried my best to explain that mommy doesn't live here anymore and that she found another man who she now lives with but the only one who understands is our 10 year old son. I feel so bad for him cuz he is having a lot of trouble dealing with this. Our 3 year old, 5 year old, and 7 year old really don't understand whats happening. They keep drawing and coloring her pictures. This whole situation is horrible and I feel so helpless."
depression,etys202,t3_cds0g3,1563321922.0,It's so hard not to text her. I still love and miss her so much. Our kids miss her and that's what I have been texting mostly. If she took me to court it would show everyone what's she is doing to our kids. She can't get custody because she is living in a dirty run down one bedroom trailer. A family friend is renting it to them but sadly he can't kick them out just because she is denying our kids their mother.
depression,etypupt,t3_cds0g3,1563321097.0,I'm doing a little better today but not by much. Working out and playing with my kids helped. She called finally to tell our daughter happy bday but didn't even ask to speak to our other 3 kids and when I asked her if she was ever coming back she hung up on me. That turned me right back into a wreck. Idk how someone could do this to their children. If she wants nothing to do with me that's fine but to do this to our kids is awful. I have texted her how much they miss her and I miss her but it hasn't changed a thing.
depression,ety5844,t1_ety2aff,1563313263.0,I can't stop texting her. The kids won't stop asking for her and I have no idea how to deal with this. I feel like im dying inside. She won't answer me even when I'm texting and calling about the kids. This is so hard.
depression,ety45du,t1_ety1ykv,1563312791.0,Ty. They are the only thing keeping me alive right now. They keep drawing pictures for their mom while I already know she won't be back. Their mom is in love with a old divorced loser who doesn't even have a job. He doesn't want her to come here because of me.
depression,etxgm52,t1_etxdrla,1563298916.0,Ty it means alot.
depression,etxamo1,t1_etx9orm,1563295206.0,I wasn't always a good guy I'm not blaming her for everything that went wrong. I was faithful for ten years but I got into drugs and wasn't around much as I should have been. I have been clean for 4 years now. I changed my entire life to be there good dad and to be there for her. Now I'm here with the kids and she is nowhere to be found.
depression,etwnr08,t1_etwnc7b,1563278542.0,I guess she is happy now and wants to forget the life we had together. I have family to help out with my kids but they never liked her so trying to talk to them is hard. They just keep telling me to forget her but that's easier said than done. I feel like I'm drowning.
depression,etwn6d9,t1_etweoh4,1563277942.0,I never thought a person could treat someone they said they love like this.
depression,etwmzok,t1_etwhwij,1563277742.0,I try not to think about her but she was the love of my life. I never imagined my life without her. The first 2 days after she left she was responding to texts and told me she will think about coming back. Then one of my family members saw her out somewhere with this guy and he was grabbing her butt in public. I feel like I'm being torn apart from the inside out. Haven't heard from her in 5 days now and each day I think It will get better but it's worse. I sleep 2 or 3 hours a night with the help of sleeping pills then I wake up with my heart pounding after having dreams about her and him having sex. The thought of another man touching her makes me wanna jump off a bridge.
depression,etwls6s,t1_etw1h5e,1563276408.0,Thank you all for the kind words and support. This is the hardest thing I ever been through. I will try and be strong for my kids. Just wish i could get her out of my head. When I look at our kids I see her. She is everywhere I look. She works close to my house and she lives with him right around the corner from my work. The thoughts of what they are doing together haunt me every day all day no matter what I do. Hopefully the pain subsides eventually but I doubt it.
