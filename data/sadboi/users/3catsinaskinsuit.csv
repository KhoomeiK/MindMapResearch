Thanks for sharing, I needed this reminder as well. Also he is incredibly precious, those eyes kill me"

Better than the time there was a young woman screaming at her boyfriend on the phone

Seattle,ewfz491,t3_cnuoq0,1565370394.0,"Appreciate the research you did. I'm not trying to fight I was stating my viewpoints on how it is becoming increasingly expensive there, and how based on my experiences and the experiences of other people who live and work there that it is very difficult to afford buying a home as well as paying the other expenses that life entails. I guess I just believe people's real life experience more than a stranger on the internet."
Seattle,ewfxf9v,t1_ewfx3rq,1565369388.0,"Thank you for seeing my point lmfao! Makes me sad cause I love bham it's an absolutely beautiful place to live. My friends mom works as a schoolteacher on the reservation up there and shes gotta move and can't find anything she can afford. She's in her 60s and doesn't wanna rent for the rest of her life, but is sorta resigned to it at this point. Shouldn't be that way in my opinion?"
Seattle,ewfwyk8,t1_ewfw5ha,1565369119.0,"Take everything as literally as possible why don't you. It is almost impossible to find a house in bham for under 500,000. How much do teachers make again? Veterinary technician's? Not enough. Not saying every single person in the world should be able to buy a house for 1 dollar . It's like everyone on here just wants to fight about shit? Just saying that the market is ridiculous."
Seattle,ewfpzo7,t1_ewfpei5,1565365701.0," what I said! And how is harder for people with high incomes to buy homes? If someone can afford to move across the country and buy a 700,000 dollar home, I'm not worried about them, they are obviously doing fine. This isn't like a ""only locals allowed"" post, I was saying that buying property should be accessible to everyone, not just wealthy people. Go have a fight w someone else cause it seems like we are on the same page."
Seattle,ewfp74l,t1_ewfoy7y,1565365361.0,No just wanna be able to afford to live where I'm from :). People with lower incomes should have access to buying homes as well. Have a nice day.
Seattle,ewfnpql,t1_ewf8i8r,1565364737.0,Yeah I'm from Bellingham. It's breaking my heart but ill probably never be able to afford to live there. And it's home. We need some strict fucking rules around housing. People who can't afford to run away and move somewhere else should be protected.
myfavoritemurder,ew12xyc,t3_cm0i3u,1565013813.0,Happened in my hometown. Everyone in my elementary school(maybe other ones) had to go on a field trip in like 4th grade(?) To whatcom falls. They have a sculpture for them there. Also built a new elementary school down Yew St and named it Wade King (after one of the victims). Really sad.
Seattle,evyr3k7,t3_clma0c,1564939320.0,Don't move to Bellingham. High home prices. Stick to ellensburg its cheaper to buy over there and it's beautiful. Bellingham has steadily gotten more expensive to live in unless you're a college student/ retired person.
Seattle,evyqttf,t1_evxa2gu,1564939132.0,"New York is actually not that expensive compared to seattle. Can find more apartments there for under 900 than here. Sf is ridiculous, only one posting for 900.  maybe I'm in a different wealth bracket than y'all if so disregard. Seattle's culture is knda odd so maybe OP consider the friendliness of the city as well? . Seattle's great but I miss the atmosphere of other cities alot now that I'm here."

I'd say I see more unpicked up dog poo than human poo. To be fair I can't always tell the difference but working with dogs for years can give you some unusual and gross identification skills.. unfortunately. Pick up your poos!!!!!!!!!"
