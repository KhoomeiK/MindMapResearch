I find very few men older than me or around my age attractive. You like what you like. And if your personalities fit. It should not matter the age difference.

To the girl that laugh at you. Shame on her for being a size queen. I've had quite a few lovers and some of the best sex I've had were with guys who were average sized.

He ended up proposing to my Mom over the phone and mailed her money to buy her engagement ring. They got married April 1st 1967. Had 5 kids. Where the most loving caring couple you'd ever meet. 
My parents love for one another is nothing like I've ever seen in anyone. They love each other and love us kids. Sadly when Dad passed away from Pancreatic Cancer. It hit my mom hard. She misses him terribly as do we all. She was by his side taking care of him all the way until the end.

It's sad that because a guy/girl finds people who are not the generalized societal ""attractive"" they feel the need to defend there actions. 
Its very sad that media and entertainment in america wants to make people believe from birth that if your not thin and fit or muscular that your unappealing and not worthy of love. Ingraning this thought in to youth causes so much more harm then good. Causes eating disorders, depression, low self esteem, bullying, and so many other detrimental issues.

Now dont get me wrong. I am an ME believer but it's hard to make this one proof because of these facts. 
For example when Green day performs live. Bill Joe Armstrong. Will sing Holiday and change the state depending on where he is performing. I've seen them perform 3 times in my lifetime. Great concerts to see. He has so much energy it's a fun time. 
So using a live performance as proof is tricky. I mean it very well may be that Freddy Mercury remembers ending the line himself. Or he just maybe threw that in because it sounded better when he did it live. Sometimes they change there mind after recording songs."
