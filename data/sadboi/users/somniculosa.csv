funny,fr3p5xz,t1_fr3mzwa,1589862578.0,"theres really no such thing as a “good reason” for depression. sometimes its just genetic, most of the time its a result of emotional trauma or other illnesses, and it feeds on shitty lifestyles. it doesnt seem to make sense, but our brains get sick just like any other organs.

Ill be honest, helping people who dont want help is impossible. and the truth is a lot of depressed people arent ready to pull themselves out.  they may be afraid of trying and failing, or they may be afraid of being happy as it is unfamiliar and the unknown can be very scary. they may be afraid of feeling happy and then losing it again. or they could honestly on some level enjoy feeling bad for themselves and being miserable. it sounds counterintuitive but it definitely happens. i have many friends that struggle with depression and its hard because i try to tell them what has helped me, but they just arent receptive. they give up on anything working before they even try. it is super frustrating, especially when youve *been there* and have found a way out, because of course you want to share with the world that you can be freed from all that stuff and you found out how! but until people decide “i am going to do whatever it takes to get better because trying and failing is better than doing nothing and guaranteeing lifelong misery” there isnt much you can do besides be patient, check on them here and there, listen whenever they open up to you, and just be an overall good friend. 

if however someone asks you for advice, i can say what has worked great for me is practicing mindfulness, being aware of my emotions and thoughts and acknowledging them while not giving them any power (meditation really helps), doing daily cardio (even just a quick walk around the block, but the more intense cardio the better the results), and journaling. the mindfulness helps me keep from getting sucked into negative thought loops that take me to dark places, the cardio releases endorphins, and helps me relax, and journaling is good for when i need to just pour out my thoughts and feelings. its also helpful to go back and read your entries because you realize how silly all the things you worry and think about are. gives you a neat perspective on the way your mind works. i usually reach a point after writing long enough where im like “ok i dont care anymore actually, ive expressed myself and its done. im gonna go do something else”. its awesome lol. 

my depression isnt gone, and i have rough days sometimes, but the severity has diminished by a lot, the bad days are less frequent, and i can honestly say i lean more towards happy than sad most days. that being said i only started all these lifestyle changes a couple months ago, so the long term effects are still to come. its only going to get better from here as long as i keep at it.

good luck to you and your friends."
GenderCritical,fr3chrb,t1_fr38gzb,1589854452.0,"Aaghhh gdi I just typed a huge response and then the app crashed. I’m gonna try to summarize what I said:

Basically I think it comes down to three of the core symptoms: distorted self image/weak sense of self, self hatred, and for the more histrionic pwBPD, simply seeking attention.

A lot of folks with BPD lack an understanding of who they are and what they believe. This can result in rapidly changing religions, political beliefs, moral codes, and it seems even gender identity. I could never relate to this symptom too much, because I feel I’m a pretty self aware person (my therapist said so too so I feel more confident saying that lol) and Im too passionate about what I believe in to change it up that much. That being said, I did grow up christian and am now pretty passionate anti christian, I went from super pro trans to gender critical, and of course have gone through a number of embarrassing gender identities. So I guess its stil lthere for me to some degree.

For me it was definitely mostly self loathing. Sprinkle a little bit of internalized misogyny in there and I was very eager to identify away from “woman” once I drank the kool aid. It gave me a sense of self too, because I grew up very gnc (and bisexual) so I always had a hard time identifying with more feminine women. I felt like an “other” a lot growing up. Now I had a community too. It felt like I had finally “found myself”. Of course once I realized nothing really changed and I still hated myself, I quickly snapped out of it.

And then there are the ones who just want more attention. I don’t mean anything malicious by that, everybody wants some attention every once in awhile, but pwBPD often have childhood trauma and many were emotionally or even physically neglected. So they constantly seek out the love and approval they never got from their parents. Its very sad and they deserve unconditional love and acceptance more than anything.

As for the subreddit, yes, I recently unsubscribed because I was sick of people talking about being manipulative and toxic as hell like it was a cute little quirk. It made me uncomfortable because for one, I cant relate to being sadistic as hell. Im not perfect, I have my anger and have been a complete dick in the midst of a meltdown. But I always feel immensely guilty and when Im feeling more “normal” I never enjoy hurting people or toying with them. I kind of think a good portion of people in that sub are actually narcissistic or even antisocial, because hurting people for fun is not a symptom of bpd. not outside of the temper tantrums at least. I also felt like these people were feeding into each others toxic behaviors and also making the stigma surrounding this disease much worse."

funny,fr31r6j,t1_fr2z71r,1589848199.0,"thats why you use willpower to do the things that create those chemicals. such as exercising. you dont need to feel happy to exercise.

edit: okay i wanna elaborate because your deliberate twisting of my words is pretty annoying.

i said that you can overcome your thoughts. as in, just because you think “i cant do this” doesnt mean you cant do it. especially when one has depression, people think all sorts of negative things about themselves. all the self doubt and self loathing is a symptom of your depression. it isnt your reality. theyre just thoughts. you can do what you will yourself to do even if your brain is screaming that you cant. 

for example: just because you FEEL like the world is out to get you, doesnt mean it is. notice how the feeling is only a feeling and the world continues to exist as it actually does in reality regardless of how you percieve it.

saying that i said you can will yourself to be happy is you purposefully misunderstanding me because you dont want to admit you have the power to be happy. you have to actually WORK for it, you cant just wish really hard that youll be happy, that wont work, as you said. but you CAN make yourself go on a walk every day, you CAN meditate for at least 30 seconds in the morning, you CAN grab a piece of paper and write out your feelings. that is something that you CAN indeed use your willpower to do even if you really dont want to. 

dont think this is coming from someone who doesn’t understand depression. i was diagnosed at the age of 12, i also suffer from a multitude of other mental issues (my childhood was pretty traumatic to say the least and ive had one traumatic event throw me for a loop in my adult life, just a year ago actually). ive been on tons of different antidepressants, ive been to multiple therapists and doctors, i was even staying in a psych ward for a short period of time while i was 17. i have hundreds of scars on my body as a constant reminder of my lifelong battle, and have experimented with a ton of drugs just to numb the pain.

but i decided i dont want to live like that anymore, and no matter what it takes, i WILL be happy, or i will die trying. i will face my emotions head on, i wont run from them or ignore them. i wont lay in bed pitying myself and wallowing in agony when i can actually DO something to change my life. as long as i have working legs, i can run. as long as i have working hands, i can journal. as long as i have a consciousness i can meditate or at least take a few moments to breathe deeply and reset. there is no excuse to have all these tools at your disposal and not use them, unless youre just more comfortable with the familiarity of misery. this isnt to beat you up, because depression often makes people feel like theyre supposed to be that way forever, and after awhile you become complacent with it. in a way you even start to like it. you can feel really bad for yourself. not to mention you start to feel like its a part of your identity, and its scary to let something that has been a huge part of you for so long go. especially with a lot of circles on the internet treating it like a super exclusive cool kid club. i was the same way. when i was a teenager i wanted to slap people who recommended yoga or taking a walk. but that was when i was a teenager. now im an adult and my life is my responsibility."
GenderCritical,fr2x2e7,t1_fr2ubnr,1589845568.0,"yes i agree. ive just seen certain circles treat us like being toxic and selfish and not seeking help or caring about people are symptoms, which... theyre not. theyre certainly not diagnostic criteria. the one time i defended people with bpd on quora after lurking in that community for awhile, i was essentially told that my attempt to defend myself was classic bpd manipulation, and was basically gaslit to hell and had my emotions minimized while being condescended to. it was one of the most upsetting things i had ever experienced because this person was treating me like a hopeless little gremlin who didnt deserve to be taken seriously just because i shared a diagnosis i had with them, and i knew if i showed any negative emotions theyd just use it as “proof” that i was nothing but a fucked up emotionally stunted freak. shit hurts."

i also tell myself that if i walk i wont regret it when its over, but if i dont i might feel good in that moment but when i go to sleep that night ill be eaten up by guilt for once again doing nothing to help myself while complaining about how miserable i am. you have to be gentle with yourself, but also assertive. dont beat yourself up, but dont coddle yourself too much either.

say to yourself “i love you, i know this is hard, but youve gotta go for a fucking walk. come on buddy. you can handle it.”

Meditation,fpgp8nk,t1_fpgnzoc,1588607023.0,"ive definitely tried meditation techniques that others swore by that just gave me a headache. thats why its so cool to me that theres so many different ways to do it. theres almost certainly a method for everybody, and certainly methods that arent for everybody."
news,fpehoko,t1_fpe74ak,1588547756.0,discrimination laws? i dont know how that relates to people wearing masks to protect others.
news,fpdx8z2,t1_fpd8djn,1588536064.0,theres a difference between being a bigot and trying to protect your customers from a real threat.
news,fpdwwfb,t1_fpdwrhn,1588535865.0,"ok cool, i dont think businesses can throw you out based on discrimination either. glad were on the same page. i disagree that thats not what the original commenter was saying though."
news,fpdlpny,t1_fpdle67,1588529466.0,"i dont think keeping people out who put others lives at risk is “discrimination”, and frankly i think its insensitive to use that word for something as stupid as not wearing a mask. but americans love to feel oppressed i guess."
MorbidReality,fpcpl60,t1_fpcpd30,1588508986.0,"i definitely wasnt saying all men rape and kill, im sorry you thought thats what i meant.

i was just getting ready to say if you cant understand what im saying then im not interested in going back and forth so, glad that worked out."
MorbidReality,fpcoqn6,t1_fpcni1v,1588508211.0,"i meeeean.... statistically it happens way more often that men rape and kill. and since you brought up “your experience”... MY experience with being attacked, abused, raped etc (and I have a lot of experience) was always at the hands of men. 

those are just the facts, dont get mad at me."
MorbidReality,fpco1vq,t1_fpclmhj,1588507570.0,"yes they are. poor baby tried to escape...

makes me want to boil the fuckers who did it alive."
MorbidReality,fpcn1jc,t1_fpcmai6,1588506581.0,"id wager thats due to those specific women’s own mistreatment at the hands of men, or just mental illness, because that’s definitely not the norm."
news,fpcle1a,t1_fpccv7t,1588504893.0,what makes you think a business doesnt have the right to throw people out? are you entitled to someones business?
GenderCritical,fp3opwg,t1_fp3mm85,1588283056.0,"dont worry. ive been out of high school for 4 years now, i dont really hang out with these people. my new friends would probably agree with me to be honest, but im a bit afraid of bringing it up. especially because when i met my current circle of friends, i was pro trans (actually identified as non binary but the only person who knew that was my boyfriend and cousin who has been my friend my whole life). im moreso talking about their activities on social media, i dont hang out with anyone from school anymore. still, its very strange seeing these folks ive known since we were in the single digits start identifying as this and that, and being very vocally anti “t*rf”. some of whom were the definition of straight white boy in high school are now woque they/thems."
GenderCritical,fp35moj,t1_fp34kez,1588273500.0,"ah, no im american, sorry, i should have clarified. despite the fact its a uk issue, a lot of folks here are talking about it. im also friends with a handful of folks from the uk on social media. i see them posting petitions, talking about writing letters to the minister... i liken it to the outrage in response to womens suffrage. people might think were going backwards now, but someday everyone will realize it was an important historical moment.

i agree with you though, im very proud of the brave and vocal gender critical feminists in the uk. it gives me hope that people are still fighting for women and lgb people."
Humanoidencounters,fp2oabz,t3_gamhao,1588265142.0,i believe thats a very blurry photo of some of trever hendersons work
BPD,fp2n4uo,t1_fp18lhe,1588264597.0,"ok this comment made me cry. youve explained what ive always struggle to explain or even understand. most people would probably never believe i even have bpd, but when i enter a romantic relationship everything changes. i dont have stormy friendships. i treat my friends well, we get along great, i dont fight with them or mistreat them. when i begin dating somebody, all of my pain and rage comes to the surface. its truly as if my inner child breaks out and acts out in pain because she was repressed as a child. i could never defend myself or get angry at my abusers, because then theyd hurt me even more. my partner is good to me, he would never lay a hand on me and is very sweet and patient with me. so my inner child seems to feel safe to act out. on a subconscious level, all of that rage has nothing to do with him. he’s basically a punching bag when i have my episodes... i definitely dont like that nor do i intend to make excuses for myself, but understanding that is so freeing. i think this can help us manage my emotions better."
BPD,fp2l3su,t1_fp1o2e1,1588263614.0,"yeah this right here. ive definitely made mistakes and hurt people due to my poor impulse control and emotional regulation issues. but outside of my episodes of anger and pain, i dont enjoy hurting people at all. im a very empathetic person (which contradicts what a lot of people believe about bpd sadly), and people who know me regularly tell me im a sweet person. i just cannot relate to some of the stuff people say they LIKE to do to other people here. it makes me feel like my diagnosis is wrong because i really loathe hurting people. after ive been triggered and calm down, i usually feel so unbearably guilty. you might be onto something about it being something else, because i really dont believe being malicious is a symptom of bpd. in my experience we only hurt people when weve been triggered, not for fun."
BPD,fp2jg6t,t1_fp20ipg,1588262800.0,oh this gives me so so much hope. i want to be able to have kids one day and i refuse to do so until im no longer engaging in toxic behaviors and have full control over my emotions. i cant ruin my children the way my family ruined me.
BPD,fp2j3vr,t3_gaoaxf,1588262633.0,"im so glad you posted this. some of the posts and comments ive seen lately have been making me so uncomfortable. i keep thinking “no wonder everybody hates us, they read this shit and think were all the same”. i even sometimes start to feel like i dont have bpd because i dont enjoy manipulating and abusing people or lying. but you’re probably right: its not that i dont have bpd, its that being extremely toxic isnt an actual symptom but simply where some people are in their journey. not trying to be hateful at all, i just want everybody to do better and not treat their toxic behaviors like symptoms."
GenderCritical,fp2hwdh,t1_fp28cis,1588262039.0,"i feel you. lately everyone has been freaking out about the new womens and equalities minister in the uk and how she wants to protect single sex spaces, and im just sitting here totally silent because to me thats really good news. i want to ask people why they think its more important for a male to feel valid while he takes a shit than for a woman to be safe from assault... but thats a shitstorm waiting to happen."
GenderCritical,fp2hgqs,t1_fp1de64,1588261827.0,wow i wish more of my friends would peak trans already lol. i have suspicions about one of my friends but dont know how to bring it up... if im wrong i could out myself and destroy our friendship (which is totally unfair).
GenderCritical,fp2hb2j,t1_fp1eee9,1588261750.0,"thats what im hopeful for. while some folks i know strike me as just trying to fit in mostly, and i dont expect them to break free until its not cool to be gender special anymore, others are really smart and i have hope that one day theyll start to catch on. i just hate having to watch my words and make sure i dont “misgender” anybody. i find myself distancing myself from non binary and trans folks just because it makes me uncomfortable pretending i take their gender seriously and knowing theyd tear me to shreds if they knew how i really felt."
GenderCritical,fp2gwcy,t1_fp19dki,1588261552.0,right... having just one person to talk to about it is just such a blessing. thats amazing that shes not even gender critical but lets you talk about your point of view without condemnation.
GenderCritical,fp2g289,t1_fp14rkh,1588261142.0,"thats the extra scary part about it. right now being pro trans is seen as the ~woke~ thing to be, and while i am pretty far left, theres a certain group of leftists who are very much into being as ideologically pure as possible and cancelling anybody who words something wrong, or is ignorant, or who makes any kind of mistake. its so unfair and does more damage than they realize."
GenderCritical,fp15xb9,t1_foyp7bb,1588225305.0,sometimes i feel like radfems are lying when they say they always knew he was a man. because i was definitely fooled. i actually for a second thought “is she just making that up to become relevant?” when i first heard about him coming out. then again i could just be really stupid lol
EatingDisorders,fp136hq,t3_g9jfoz,1588223150.0,"im new to this sub, im not entirely sure if i have an ed or not (i definitely have a really unhealthy relationship with food and my body and have for as long as i can remember really) but i do have ibs and im in the middle of one of the longest stretches of a lack of appetite ive ever been in, and its making me lose a lot of weight really fast, i straight up forget to eat like all day and i barely eat much when i do because eating just feels so overwhelming when you dont have an appetite. but im like... kinda really enjoying the weight loss even though i know its unhealthy. in fact im worried that that and the fact ive started working out during quarantine are creating an eating disorder in me. ive started feeling really guilty about eating anything because i dont want to gain even a little bit of my weight back. its difficult."
MorbidReality,follr7n,t1_follikj,1587864993.0,"idk man it didnt bother me. seemed genuine and not like an attempt to come off as a badass at all, especially with her mentioning she cant fight. i can relate to being angry at shitty rude aggressive people. fuck them indeed."
MorbidReality,foll9j1,t1_foll3fu,1587864678.0,everybody on reddit is a misanthrope tho. and if you bump into somebody on purpose you deserve to get hit honestly. everybody on here is an edgelord until a woman does it and now we care so much about people (who purposefully bump into others)?
funny,foll02f,t3_g7ye0o,1587864510.0,all jokes aside they’re obviously very good buddies and thats adorable
MorbidReality,folkvap,t1_folkq3a,1587864427.0,i cannot comprehend why else people would be massively upset that someone doesnt let people take advantage of them on the street.
MorbidReality,foljjcv,t1_foknny3,1587863597.0,"what in the hell made everyone so mad about this comment? oh wait. you mentioned being a woman. 

that explains it."
politics,fohlxxg,t1_foh3s9h,1587768160.0,"christ, this comment made me depressed. dont remind me how stupid americans are please."
politics,fohgno9,t1_fohg9nf,1587765677.0,well yeah... but theres no need to say that every time we criticize conservatism. no one is forgetting that.
GenderCritical,fohfec4,t1_fog5m9a,1587765010.0,ive seen several women i know turn to sex work already due to being laid off. its making me so sad but if i say anything im an evil swerf.
