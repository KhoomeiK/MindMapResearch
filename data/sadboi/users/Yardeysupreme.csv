I agree that (in my experience) people in certain subs are not very sympathetic or understanding to peoples posts.

In fact the number one rule for this sub is Don't be an asshole/be respectful to others.

Anyways sorry to hear about your situation I am/have been a step father in current/previous relationships and part of accepting that package is loving your partners kids. So any breakups are not just with your partner it will be with their kids too unless you both agree to still be a part of the kids lives.

There is no one size fits all answer to your question as there are so many other factors to consider. How bad was the break up? How involved is the kids biological father? How involved was you in the kids life? Would it make sense for you to still be involved with the child if you are no longer with the parent?"

I then mentioned it to my female friend (F28) and she said the girls being a b**** and take no notice of it.

This has reasurred me after seeing some of the comments but I hope iys not just a case of backing their friend.

I asked a female friend about it and she says she can see I look awkward and that its very noticeable. 

Judging by the response I need to pay attention to what am saying over what I'm physically doing?

An ex of mine said there's no fire between us before we broke up. 

A girl I was with for several years left because I became too reclusive. Her friend she met after we started dating thought I was weird too.

My awkwardness can be very noticeable and unlike most shy people it comes off more weird guy than shy guy?

But maybe I need to focus on what I am saying more?

I don't really flirt.

Another example is 3 girls that was passing me in the street insist I tag along with them on their night out. I went with them but by the end of the night one said to me you're really boring. Nothing more came of it.

The advice I have been given by friends and even therapists is to ""put myself out there"". No one really tells me to ""stop doing this or that"".

askwomenadvice,fasgw5z,t1_farl3dj,1576327319.0,"I probably come across as insecure, my eye contact in those situations was probably off and my body language very closed and defensive. I remember one girl saying she wanted me to be more or a jerk for being too much of a nice guy.

My self esteem is not great when it comes to socialising. I take care of my self, dress trendy, but my inner self in terms of self esteem is seriously lacking. 

I suppose the question I should ask is what should I do to counteract this in the dating world? Or do I just work on this beforehand?"
askwomenadvice,fasflvz,t1_farcma2,1576326956.0,"I wouldn't know where to start. 

It'll probably be easier for me to explain the date. I was invited over to her house we sat down on her L shaped sofa (we wasn't directly facing each other) we watched TV and talked about general stuff nothing dating related.  We didn't really connect or vibe. I mentioned that we should go out to a bar on the next date but she said she wouldn't be interested in going on another date. I politely said ""that's a shame"" and said I should probably leave - she told me I could stay longer if I wanted, but I politely declined.

I thought it must be my looks as I didn't say  anything out of the ordinary. When I got back home and saw her status I realised it wasn't.

In the past I remember going on a date (if you could call it that), where me (M at 21) and my friend (M21) met up with 5 girls (F20-21). One I had been talking to for a while and we was hitting it off, but when we met up a similar thing happened. I heard murmurs and got the impression her friends thought I was weird. I felt the same level or awkwardness as I did on the date I mentioned above.

A couple of months later this same girl saw me out with my friends at my Uncles MMA event (I didn't see her so was probably just my usual relaxed self - I recall not feeling that anxious/ awkward way that night). It turns out she was watching me for a good while. She messaged me the next day saying her friends thought I looked hot (same ones who thought I was weird) and wanted to meet up again. We ended up dating for a few months (I never felt that awkward feeling during that time).

I'm quite sure it's not what I say, but maybe how uncomfortable I look?

I think people assume I'm going to be this alpha male (based on the way I look) but in reality I'm just a humble guy.

There's probably a lot more I could add to this, so let me know if this helps make things clearer?"

We literally just had small talk (talked about TV shows). I didn't try to make a move on her in a physical way as there wasn't any signs she wanted that. I think my body language may have been hard to read and eye contact might have been ""off key"". I really don't know so I'm just guessing based on how I felt at the time.

I'm usually a respectful guy, but I get the impression people expect me to be arrogant or a jerk based on looks. I'm told I sound posh and speak articulate. When I've talked to girls I've met via online apps they usually say ""didn't expect you to sound like that"".

When you try to socialise in other people's setting whilst dealing with SA you end up doing it for the sake of it just to try to fit in and keep everyone else happy.

I would sometimes hold my wee in just to avoid walking pass that open office space. It was excruciating. I am totally different when I am relaxed and comfortable but never felt like that in my old job.

All I can say is look for professional help. I received the wrong kind of professional help whilst i was working in my old job, but when I got made redundant (thank God) I found a therapist who worked wonders. If I had that type of help at my old job it would have helped me massively.

The key is becoming the master of yourself, try not to allow external things to affect the amazing person you are inside.

Gunners,ewluoet,t1_ewltyid,1565536336.0,"Didn't have much of the ball.

Towards the end he did this nice little turn with the ball that got a few cheers from the crowd.

It might take him a few matches to gel with the team, here's hoping he hits the ground running."
Gunners,ewluh66,t1_ewltzd0,1565536183.0,"I feel Nelson is not quick enough at releasing that final ball which leads to play being slowed down. 

Wilock looked good but I prefer him as box to box.

We need more creativity from the midfield."
Gunners,ewluaeg,t3_coxn1k,1565536043.0,"Good result! 

Realistically I don't expect the team to hit the next gear until the new signings and Holding/Bellerin are fully integrated. It could take a while before they gel and fully understand each other. Hopefully that happens sooner rather than later."
FantasyPL,ewfn2pr,t3_cnxvkc,1565364457.0,"Advice

Barkley, Trossard or Ceballos"
FantasyPL,ewf2ruc,t1_ewe11s5,1565348972.0,Any chance of Iwobi starting?
Gunners,evxsmlg,t1_evxrfpx,1564905704.0,I've heard Cabellos is a Ramsey replacement (will play as an 8). Coutinho would probably be used instead of Ozil in away games
Gunners,evxsi8i,t1_evvpr2l,1564905534.0,I could see him rotating with Mkhi (if he's not sold) and Ozil. At the very least it's good for depth.
Gunners,evurnxy,t1_evubq74,1564804018.0,Would you say adding another CDM would help? I feel we need more than Ceballos and Willock especially for good rotation within the team. Torreria is our only real CDM atm and last season burnt him out. We need someone who can replace him like for like if/when he gets rested.
Gunners,evp2uwi,t1_evp1wsh,1564664812.0,Max Aarons would be good imo
