h3h3productions,fnv40z3,t1_fnuchgl,1587279508.0,"I’m an “Ethan hater” and I’ll do my best to try and explain how myself and so many others feel. 

“I think people just got to know yeah better through the podcast and don’t like who he really is”

You really hit the nail on the head there. People are upset because previously we only got a well rehearsed, researched, and bite size condensed version of Ethan that had a script and editing to get his thoughts and ideas across. Now, nobody is going to perfect during a 2/3 hour podcast, but it was a kind of peek at the man behind the curtain. 

A lot of us also got into his videos dunking on crazy feminists and SJWs and were disappointed when he supported candidates that those same people support. But I don’t get too into politics here. 

On top of seeing a long form version of Ethan full of bad takes, mistakes, etc we all watched him get filthy rich. More rich than any of us would ever get. If he kept on making the kinds of content that he was before the podcast and he got rich, many people wouldn’t have minded. 

It’s all about the timing. It seems as though as soon as he got rich, he completely abandoned the content that made him his money and fame in the first place. He walked away from it, moved to LA, and his overall attitude completely changed. 

So now you have the perfect storm of: 

1. A complete change of content type. 
2. A change in attitude (or maybe, more seeing what his personality has always been)
3. A huge change in how much money he has. 

I think a lot of people dislike those who have more money than them, for various reasons. It could be jealousy, or feeling that someone doesn’t deserve the amount of money that they have. 

A lot of us think that in this case it has completely destroyed a humble, relatable, and lovable person. 

I still watch the podcast, I still watch the videos when he puts them out, but at this point it feels like I’m in a marriage that has lost all of it’s love and we’re going through the motions to stay together for the kids. 


It’s 3AM and this was just what was on mind, but I hope this helps clear up why some of us are feeling animosity towards Ethan."
