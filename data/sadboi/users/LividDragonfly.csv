Been refraining from posting in Reddit except for the occasional links I like from some tech sites I follow and the reaction is always bad.

You get downvoted for no reason. You receive harsh comments. People call you dumb or stupid or say mean things in comments. I just recently joined a tech-related subreddit then got banned permanently just because I posted something that the moderator considered a trash. No warnings whatsoever why they are offended, they just deemed you trash and not worthy of their \`community\`.

Social media really brings out the worst in people but Reddit seems to be on a higher-level; some users just can't seem to tolerate others who have different views from them."

Correct me if my understanding is wrong since it's been a while since I read the book, I think Toranaga does not really aspire for the highest position at first but then certain circumstances and part ambition compelled him to. I remember Mariko also said ""You must take the power to give power."" Meaning, Toranaga should be the Shogun otherwise some other incompetent fool might take that place and just ruin everything for everyone. Also, from their own point of views, each character is just doing the ""right"" thing that will benefit them.

I found a first-print edition, signed copy of Homer's The Iliad signed by its translator Robert Fagles. I think Fagles' translation is one of the best when it comes to Greek classics. 

I was not really supposed to get that book, it was reserved for another customer but that copy had a lot of writing inside (in pencil though), notes and scribbles by the previous owner. I mean every page has a note and whoever used it really did a thorough study. The supposed customer don't want writings in their books so they did not get that copy and I got it. They may not have noticed that on the title page, there was a signature. I searched online and that signature matches the signature of Robert Fagles and I think it was his but even if it's not the book was a good find.

Footnote: A few months after getting the copy The Iliad by Fagles, I was able to get a copy of The Odyssey translated by Fagles also and first-print edition too on the same used bookstore but this one wasn't signed though.

He has this hero Dirk Pitt which makes recurring appearance in most of his books. While his books are interesting reads, I do notice in his stories that Dirk Pitt is like a super, alpha-male, invincible hero that no matter how bad the situation is, he can always survive and there will always be some sort of deus ex machina that will make the stories alright at the end.

I remember reading one of this books where Dirk Pitt's boat was sunk, then he was stranded in a desert for many days without food or water but he still survives the ordeal with barely a scratch.

On the other hand, Shogun and Gai-Jin did very well in illustrating Japanese culture and history while Tai-Pan and Noble House gave a vivid background on Hong Kong and Chinese culture. His book King Rat is on a different note since it is based on Clavell's experiences as a POW during WW2. 

The books only present  the historical situation during that time when the events supposedly happen. It is quite known in history that Europeans colonisers think themselves superior while Asians think that Europeans are inferior. The main characters are British and the stories revolve around Europeans in Asia but I don't see it as ""white saviour"" sounding. Some may also note that his books' characters tend to focus only on the male and the ""British boys club"" but then again some of his most formidable characters are women.

These are just my thoughts. You may have a different opinion on what is racist or offensive but I suggest you try to read Shogun first to see for yourself."

suggestmeabook,erwhkis,t3_c4ggkk,1561343819.0,"I would suggest Winter Of The World by Ken Follet. This is quite a lengthy story which discusses the events leading up to World War 2 up to the war itself with different perspectives from the British, German and Russian characters. While this provides quick background info during WW2, do mind that this does not cover in detail all the battles, warfare and other detailed events. It is also book 2 in the Century Trilogy by Follet. The first book, Fall of Giants, is about the onset and events of World War 1 which I also suggest you read first for better appreciation of the stories.

&#x200B;

For nonfiction references though, you might want to check out books by Antony Beevor."

suggestmeabook,erv0hat,t1_erurb7q,1561302930.0,"I agree with this also! I am now on the 5th book (by internal chronology), Noble House. There are 6 books in total in the Asian Saga. The other books are great reads too. His other book in the saga, Gai-Jin, is set in 1860s Japan."
suggestmeabook,eruxt4v,t1_erujef5,1561300707.0,"I agree with you on Casual Vacancy but her Galbraith books are quite different. I remember reading Cuckoo's Calling together with my friends and we took turns speculating how the crime will be solved. It's worth a try.

Preston & Child's books are also highly recommended. Still Life With Crows is really an engrossing mystery with a bit of scare.

Whichever book you choose, happy reading!"

UmbrellaAcademy,eru7ahr,t3_c3wika,1561265720.0,Interesting also that none of the siblings ever seem to recognise her. I mean like in Episode 4 Klaus was seated directly in front of her at the bus and even flirted with her and at Episode 10 Klaus was also there when she asked if it's ok for Number 5 to play with Kenny. Either it's intentional or there's more to this woman that we should watch out in Season 2...

suggestmeabook,ertw4vv,t3_c3w6u2,1561255084.0,"Suggestions:

&#x200B;

01. Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child's books:

\- Cabinet Of Curiosities, Still Life With Crows, Relic, etc.

While you can read them on their own, I suggest to read them in order for better enjoyment & appreciation. They have built some sort of a 'universe' for their recurring characters. Most of their stories are set in New York City.

&#x200B;

02. Robert Galbraith books:

\- Cuckoo's Calling, Silkworm, Lethal White, etc.

You may already know that Galbraith is also J.K. Rowling's pen name. The stories are quite good also.

&#x200B;

03. Caleb Carr books:

\- The Alienist, Angel Of Darkness

This books are set in 1890s New York and often tagged as 'historical mystery' novels. The Alienist was also adapted into a TV series.

&#x200B;

04. Stieg Larsson's Millenium series books

\- The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo etc.

This has been adapted into movies and has been quite popular recently so may know the stories already."

I noticed that the countries in the top 10 list mostly have cooler climates. If you live in tropical or hot countries it would be very uncomfortable to ride on a bike under the scorching sun. For example in Singapore, the infra for cycling is available in some areas but on a hot day I would rather take the public transport. Good thing that Singapore's public transport is very organised and reliable also."
