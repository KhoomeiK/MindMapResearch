schizophrenia,fe1suzh,t3_emabv3,1578830456.0,"I'm merely fairly basically depressed/anxious but I am aware of the more severe issues more serious disorders represent, but this sub has been compelling me toward specialising or at least volunteering in helping those with psychotic mental disorders in my line of work (law). It seems an especially cruel condition and it just feels right to help. Understanding is the key I guess."

RationalPsychonaut,f99sv35,t1_f92zwis,1575194828.0,"I was compelled for the first time in a number of years to create a reddit account to respond to this. This somewhat reflects my own experience. I was raised Roman Catholic, had quite a staunch period of being Atheist in my teenage years, and now, well... I don't know what there is. It's very possible I'm just stupid.

Nonetheless, I do still find it helpful to regard myself as a Catholic for those reasons you described. It may be slightly sacrilegious to suggest, but I actually find the Catholic doctrine of Transubstantiation of the Eucharist to be quite informative to the psychedelic experience - the notion that, regardless of the apparent reality of something as it appears to the senses, it has, in fact, become that thing - in the case of the Eucharist, the body and blood of Christ.

Then again, I am currently candyflipping, so its also possible that I'm just talking insane nonsense."
