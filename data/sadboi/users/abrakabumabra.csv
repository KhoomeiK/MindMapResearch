So from her experience I can tell you that it helps to loose weight, but the same importance has what and how much do you eat. 

Heart rate is going lower, and it becomes less efficiant for weight loss. Now she walks with addition weight +2kg on each leg. 

You need at least 120 pulse for fat burn.

marathons,f148ra3,t3_d7lyo3,1569171047.0,"Do not underestimate your pace. 
And start near appropriate entrance. Entrances are separated by finish times/paces.
If you start too far, you will have to pass thousands of people which are slower than you. 

Second thing, is that there will be pacers (guys with the baloons). By my experience, they don‚Äôt keep constant pace, and often are slower in the first half of marathon, bacause of many people in the way and faster the second path. 
So better use your own watch for pace. 

Third thing, there might be automatic cameras, which you agree be taken photo by. Better know where they are, to avoid bad photos )

https://images.app.goo.gl/qJMaFkxYypfQV4AQ9

Most important advice i can give you - don‚Äôt look at your pace or speed, instead monitor your Heart rate. First year I ran <160 bpm, to build heart strenght. It was really hard psychologically to run slow. But you need this 10000% garantee. 

Second thing is to work on your cadence - google it.develop it. Ideal cadence is 180 per minute. 

Speed will come naturally. I got from running 7km max to 42km with a result  3:45 hrs just in 2 years. 

1. Build heart strenght.
2. Build cadence 
3. Be dedicated to your running plan. Be hyped! 

Good luck"
