BPD,fqm4ite,t1_fqm4ekq,1589471374.0,People also started taking advantage of it they would do something really shitty that would hurt me and then they’d say it was bpd that was making me feel this way.
BPD,fqm48vu,t1_fqlv9q6,1589471238.0,This is also important I got to a similar stage and felt like I was in a prison because I never allowed myself to get mad at anyone
BPD,fqipv1i,t3_gj1nob,1589399265.0,"For me it’s either constant “ I want to go home” , “ I want it to stop”, or “ I want my mom”"
BPD,fqg5v9v,t3_giltnk,1589338636.0,"Doing things that i later reflect on as Abusive are  one of the biggest things I struggle with. I hate to think of myself like that and I hate thinking about any harm I’ve ever caused to anyone in my life. Before I got help I did a lot of questionable things, now awhile after and navigating this with the disorder in mind I haven’t done anything like that"
Bedding,fqg5gdj,t1_fqg16s7,1589338383.0,I’ve been looking into them and so many people are saying it’s not real silk which is my only hesitation with purchasing from them
BPD,fqex691,t3_gic6ys,1589315066.0,"Yay!!!! Happy birthday , they can be really hard I’m so happy yours turned out great"
Bedding,fpwzh6i,t3_gfg3au,1588972810.0,It’s important to me because it’s the barrier between me and my comforter keeps things cleaner and easier to maintain. I also have sensitive skin so I use my flat sheet and fitted sheet material to make sure everything else doesn’t irritate me
BPD,fpkf1ep,t3_gdvigh,1588693501.0,This is so relatable I don’t know what the fuck is up with it but it’s so true. It’s kind of tiring Ana exhausting
Bedding,fpb4el4,t3_gcbx2f,1588461875.0,"Right now personally I find that high quality cotton or linen is the best to go when doing bedding especially if you have more sensitive skin ( I have eczema),  blanket wise I’m unsure since it depends if you want to keep cool or warm but overall seems less important than sheets since they are in direct contact with you. My advice is too be careful and don’t just believe everything the marketing says the sheets are. Always check the inside tags and do research on the individual product you’re interested in"
BPD,fpa32on,t3_gc46zq,1588439817.0, I imagine this all the time it’s so unhealthy to dwell on though
BPD,fok88ek,t3_g7vbd6,1587837229.0,I hate this too it makes me feel really evil for some reason and like a villain. I try so hard to control my bpd symptoms but my friends told me they still feel like I take things they say the wrong way and such and that they can’t say fully what they want to say to me. I actually feel awful about it. I try to explain what is super triggering to me and it’s ironic because sometimes they won’t reply to something serious I send them because they don’t know how to reply and say that any way they reply won’t help so it pointless. But being ignored and the classic abandoned is what triggers me most !!!! It’s such a difficult cycle sometimes I think everyone would be better off without me
BPD,fojscos,t1_fojs611,1587828371.0,"Oh sorry I didn’t mean that as in other people with narcissism are bad, just that for me it’s always been a huge fear of becoming one because my second grade teacher called me one. And since then I’ve been terrified of self fulfilling it lol. 
But that’s true it’s just another thing to work on :)"
BPD,fojrjb7,t1_foj5ggq,1587827872.0,I’ve always been terrified of being a narcissist like I try to stop any tendency I have that veers  towards it. But who knows maybe I could be but it’s break my heart
BPD,foiew0p,t1_foicuhf,1587785038.0,This is kind of the weird thing. I’m kind of vain not in like a way I find myself superior to others in any way. But I do find myself attractive in some ways. I’m harsh about beauty standards but before I got messed up I thought I dressed and did my makeup sexy and looked sexy it’s just so bizarre for me
BPD,fogeara,t1_foduets,1587751476.0,We’ve all got a chameleon soul
BPD,foeidet,t3_g70ov2,1587704556.0,I hate this so much it’s like I never have a valid reason to be upset ever because I’m mentally ill????? So annoying
BPD,fnj6s3p,t1_fnir9ek,1586993041.0,I’m sorry that it really frustrating. I went through a period where I was on top of the world confident and could take pics and do stuff whenever. And when you come down from that it really is like being a completely different person
BPD,fnio5g4,t1_fninpvg,1586983389.0,I know o hate that so much too sometimes I feel like my life would be better in an era where technology and social media wasn’t so image obsessed. I don’t know why they want a picture ever day. I’m more of an imperson slut anyways. I am also hypersexual but this is definitely beginning to ruin it
BPD,fnfufeh,t3_g1dunh,1586915693.0,This is the most me thing I’ve ever read. It’s almost madening because I know it’s ducking ridiculous
unpopularopinion,fn7fsoq,t1_fn5459m,1586719467.0,I posted in this sub about something that happened to me confused and people were super helpful there and I appreciated it a lot but this was back when it first opened.

BPD,fn264tf,t1_fn243vm,1586578901.0,Such a true statement
BPD,fn24xdf,t3_fyk5zk,1586577953.0,Oh my gosh it’s so irritating also they use it to manipulate 80 percent of the time and gaslight me and tell me I can’t trust my reality because I should know I’m not “ right” and my mind is convincing me otherwise. That’s not how bpd functions at all. They also assume sexually I’m fine with whatever 🙃
DadsGoneWild,fmz33ck,t3_fxxy1c,1586504540.0,Incredible 😍

BPD,fktcin4,t3_fkkrhe,1584513906.0,"I went from obsessively taking pictures and staring into mirrors as hatred to absolutely avoiding all reflections. All the mirrors in my room and bathroom are covered im uncomfortable with slight reflections you can see in windows/surfaces and sometimes cry or have a little anxiety spike if I almost catch a glimpse. I don't know if I have body dysmorphia (Got brief diagnosis but idk if its the true cause)  but I know there is something horribly off with me and my appearance. I try taking very straightforward photos or nudes and describing myself objectively through measurements. But it all looks strange to me. I can't bring myself to look in the mirror. or any reflection of me. I haven't for like 5 months. Its very strange and obsessive and gives me the most suicidal feelings out of anything even my BPD. Idk if any of that was helpful but I thought I'd share my experience. I hope you feel better :(

when I have to be in an area with a mirror I avoid it at all costs, even if it makes me look ridiculous to others, I don't even like seeing my shadow. The hairdressers is the worst my mind has actually adapted where like I make my eyes blur out my face in the mirror while im siting"
DadsGoneWild,f0jtyo0,t3_d53yql,1568662981.0,This is what I mean when I say men approaching their 50s are the hottest !!!!!!
