NoStupidQuestions,fjci6fu,t3_f4kakz,1583221123.0,"While I agree that this is a fucked up by product of capitalism, I also just wanna point out that you don't need to be rich or do the absolute max to contribute to a healthier environment. Finances do limit some of the things you can do to help the environment, but it doesn't limit all of them. It doesn't cost extra money to say you don't need a bag at Walgreens or the grocery store. Ask for no straws at a restaurant. Turn the water off when washing dishes/brushing your teeth (which might help you save on the water bill too-don't come for me I don't actually know the math). Recycle. Reuse containers from restaurants or other food products. I cook a lot and I freeze all of my compost, then take it to a compost site every few weeks. I have an eating disorder and I personally can't declare myself a ""vegetarian"" or ""vegan,"" because it would be problematic for me, but I try to eat plant based foods and meat subs 60-70% of the time. Meat is actually (usually) more expensive, so I always save a decent amount on groceries whenever I eat less meat. There are so many other little ways you can make a big contribution that don't involve making a big investment. Several of those things do, however, involve overriding preexisting habits and we as busy, mostly poor humans prefer things to be quick, easy, consistent, and convenient. We fall into the trap of not developing these new habits because it's simply just easier and more desirable to do things the way we always have. I don't know if you were asking for a real answer or if it was moreso just venting, but regardless it is possible for environmentally friendly solutions to meet you where you're at, wherever that might be. 🌍"

I try to avoid indica/indica doms cause of the higher thc content. I'm also a bong smoker and I haven't been able to have a bong for the past couple months and since going back to joints/vapes/etc., I've noticed how much more you can basically like microdose. But yeah I think it has a lot to do with THC aggravating anxiety, so if you're stuck in thinking traps/a bad mood beforehand or you don't monitor how much THC you're getting, you're probably gonna have somewhat of an anxiety attack. Clearly I've thought about this a lot so I can keep weed in my life HAHAHAHAHHA."
