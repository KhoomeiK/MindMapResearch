-460grams of cauliflower
-2 garlic cloves
-salt and your favourite spices
Ã—Ã—Ã—Grate the cauliflower, chop the garlic in little cubes and saute in a pan without oil, put a pot lid so it does not get burn and remove constantly. It must be ready in 5-8 minutes 

Green sauce:
-420grams of zucchini (1 big)
-80 grams of aubergine (a half)
-60 grams of green bell pepper (a half)
-60 grams of onion (a half)
- 1 garlic clove
-5 leaves of basil (forgot to log it)
-50 grams of cauliflower (this is optional, I added it because it was the part of the veggie that I couldn't grate and put it here bc I thought it would give it a creamy texture which it did)
-salt and your favourite spice
Ã—Ã—Ã— Chop the onion and saute without oil, add the spices, add a bit of salt and cover the pot so the onion gets watery, add the garlic clove chopped and the add the rest of the veggies, once it all is cooked proccess it in a blender.

You'll end up with a lot of sauce which can also be a veggie soup if you add more water or plant milk.

My spices were oregano, rosemary, basil, black pepper, paprika, some merkÃ©n bc I love it."

For example in my country even the fascistic president received her with big open arms at the same time he send war equipment and soldiers to kill indigenous people, they shoot their schools everyday and just this month 3 activists ""commited suicide"". Bussines kills them the state as always covers up for them.

Just 7 months ago a 18 years old ""commited suicide"" he was an activist, he wad told to stop and to leave town as well, he was found hanging from a tree but he was dead before he was in the tree, he had a newborn baby. Quintero is a small town located in a bay, over 20 high contaminating empresses are located there and there are more plans to keep the number higher. People can't even shower with that water and they are dying really fast of fulminant cancer. I did an etnography there about how people experience contamination an it is hearth breaking and so so unfair. The state is killing them.
