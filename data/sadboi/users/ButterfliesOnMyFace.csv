BPD4BPD,fqt83jt,t3_gi6acf,1589632785.0,Late to the party but your meme game is 💯👌
BPD,fqt7fgq,t3_gct946,1589632249.0,"Oof, I am late to the party. I pick at my lips for 18 years+. I did not know it was a form of self-harm, I still can't believe it. I pick until I bleeds sometimes and it still does not phase me.   But it is best if I stop it. I need to invent some fingertips electricity device so when I start to touch my lips *buzz buzz* and I stop. They say it takes 21 days to break a habit, who Knows maybe it will happen."
BPD,fqt6mtq,t3_gkspe3,1589631585.0,"Hello, I am also a quiet borderline. I honestly would tell them everything symptom that I am feeling, as in when I would talk to my therapists I would tell them everything that I feel is wrong or bad in me, not holding anything back. I made the mistake, in the beginning, to hold stuff back because I did not want to scare them, but at this point, they are paid to help you.  If they diagnose you with bipolar, don't be offended. Honestly, it is common for BPD to be coupled with something like Bipolar or other disorders.  They can diagnose you with whatever, but only you know deep down inside how you really feel. When they diagnose you with \_\_\_\_\_, ask them **why? What symptoms am I displaying? How did you come to this diagnosis? T**hen I would bring up the BPD stuff and say ""**Why did you not diagnose me with BPD? I display many of the symptoms.""** And don't be afraid, they're here to help you, gotta make the most out of it.

*""I already feel like an imposter and not ""worthy"" of identifying with BPD.""* A lot of us feel this way because we don't act exactly as they portray us in the books or movies, and feel like we gotta prove ourselves. This also made things worse for me, I overthought things and overreacted, plus all your emotions are going up to 1000, BPD rage kicks in and they called the cops on me. All because I was frustrated and I felt like I had to prove myself. As the years passed, this feeling goes away and reality sets in that we're all messed up in our own ways, so don't worry whether or not your bpd enough. All of us are different, but we all still have BPD. If you feel the symptoms and you know deep in your heart that this is you, I'd go with it, whatever the doctor has said. I'd also read lots of books to educate myself but seems like you already studied this. Anyway, I hope this helped in some shape or form."
BPD,fqpq1uu,t1_fqmomvb,1589551820.0,"Yes, I heard many disorders overlap, which is very confusing. Doctors are doctors. They see things from a medical point of view, not an emotional one like we do. Their view is supposed to be ""unbiased"" and just facts. Professionals are taught what the higherups think is right, but I feel like it would help them a lot to read first-hand accounts of biographies or diaries, etc. of people with the disorder. I am sure there are doctors or medical people out there with BPD, and they could give their perspective."

Prying on some poor person's reddit for your own gain says a lot about you. You are trashhhhhhhh. Exploiting a person's mental illness for your benefit, you need serious help.

BPD,fqmlkb7,t1_fqmk6y6,1589479451.0,"Awww, I'm sorry about that. I hope that eventually it fully heals. I feel the same way, in the beginning, a little while after it happens, I'm like ""kewl."" But then I realize, oh shiet. I like that you found a new word for it, self-splitting. It sounds like a new discovery. Also that line at the end of the poem is cool. I wanan write a poem now."
BPD,fqlegss,t3_gjge5b,1589455728.0,"Self-image: Low to seafloor level. Often just low.

I'm decent one moment and then I become something else, something unpleasant. I feel like the modern-day female version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  When I am in my worse state, I am upset and it's wrong to take out all this black boiling bubbling oil of negative feelings out on others, so I take it out on myself cuz I start hating myself. Ironically, the part that I think is one of the nicest parts of myself (thighs) is the one I damaged. I didn't realize this until now.  Hmmmm 🤔maybe self-splitting really is a thing.

I have medicine that I take for emergencies, I needed them so fking badly in that moment that she did want to give them to me. Wanted to punch her so fking badly. 

It fking hurts but don't even bother talking to them. Sadly, you have to be the one pulling yourself together, no one to help you. They will only just make things worse. Sorry I wish this was positive."

People who deny mental health issues or claim they don't need therapy, are usually the ones that need it the most. I hope you can get out of there soon and it's not my place to say, but I'd kick her out of my life. She seems like she takes pleasure in putting you down. How disgusting and low do you have to be to do that. Maybe she gets a kick out of making you miserable. It's  extremely difficult, but I would try so hard not to react, because it seems like she enjoys that and I would not want to give her the pleasure.

Aside from that, I bet you are beautiful even tho she makes you seem out as if you are ugly. She's the one that probably feels ugly inside. Often times people are projecting which is that is how she actually feels about her self and is taking it out on you. Once they put you down, they are already below you.
