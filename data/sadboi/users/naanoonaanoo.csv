When we educate our children, instead of hiding things from them, they tend to not make the same mistakes. When we hide a thing? Mistakes are repeated and sometimes worse than the first time.

AskReddit,fr1iqk4,t3_gm46eg,1589820430.0,"Pretty much all the local places in my neighborhood. Our liquor store recently got busted for running a food stamp scam, the 7-11 across the street got busted for holding underground Taliban friendly meet ups a few years back, the barbershop on the corner is a front for a cocaine and heroin racket, the pizza place is run by Sikhs so everything is fine on that front they’re the only ones not running a front and I have no idea about the Thai food place but they also appear to not be putting on a front. Last but not least a church on my street is mighty white. As in you think they are holding a support group but really it’s the klan or similar group deciding what they want to do about the above liquor store/711/barbershop. 

The racial divide my neighborhood is huge and very apparent. There is one long street that divides. On one side Its deeply impoverished families. Mostly migrants and black people. The other side is upper middle class and white. Like all white. These people stay on their side of the street and flip their shit if one of their tiny marshmallows so much as looks across that one street. 

These people are all also a very tight knit community involved in politics and Congress and they have done their absolute best to keep things divided. Like gone to the government and had zip codes adjusted so their kids don’t have to attend school worth the kids in the wrong side of the street. They’ve protested and harassed Jewish people and a synagogue out of the neighborhood. They’ve got a super illegal version of a neighborhood watch set up with local police. 

Like I get wanting to protect ones property but my neighbors are crazy racists. My guys best friend  lived with us for a while. He’s Nigerian and a very large dude. I can’t tell you how many times the neighbors called the cops on us when he was living here. We were left nasty notes and they would do things like try to have our vehicles towed off the street or turning over our trash cans on trash day, one ripped up all our mail and scattered it on our lawn and one keeps leaving crucifixes on the front door. 

He moved out and things calmed down. Then we had a coworker renting from us for a bit. He’s from Puerto Rico. Which is a US territory. The harassment began again immediately and was amplified. 

Only one neighbor has tried to confront me. It happened when in the very beginning and was about letting the “wrong kind of people” live with us and how I was ruining their property value as a result. I don’t handle confrontation well and I handle racism and baseless hate even less well. 

I snapped off on this man. At first he was angry. You could see it. He did not appreciate a woman speaking to him the way I was. He quickly went from angry to “I better gtfo of here”.  I didn’t scream or threaten or attack. I just let my mouth repeat what my brain was thinking without any kind of filter. 

No one ever approached again. Short of the passive aggressive stuff they pull on the daily to try and run me out. The crucifix thing kills me. I have now collected like 30 of them and I don’t know if this lady is stealing them from her church or what but they are nice. Wood and bronze. Can’t be cheap. Once I have enough I’m going to make her a giant pentagram and baphomet head out of them that I intend to leave right back on her door.

Bitch has been ripping me off for like 20 years. I’m not even mad and she still has no idea that I know. I thought me telling her guys to keep the change would trigger something but it never did. 

I basically own her though and she has no idea I that I know. I’m saving that for future reference.

AskReddit,fqs4da6,t3_gkmhlw,1589598244.0,"Furries. I have problems with things like clowns and mimes and people in costume. It’s not on purpose and I don’t begrudge anyone for loving what they love. 

I just can’t handle things that are semi human but not quite human that want to touch and cuddle you. 

I don’t want anything trying to touch or cuddle me. Especially not some nightmare rabbit or worse. Dated a guy that decided to surprise me with his furry fetish without warning one day. 

I had no idea who was in my house. I panicked and I set the house on actual fire. Not on purpose. There were a series of accidental events. Most of them involved  me panicking.

If I had just been given some kind of warning or explanation. Things would have been fine. It was like walking into a nightmare carnival. 

In still trying to get used to the Juggalos. Who are amazingly kind people. Just they look like mines and that freaks me the fuck out. The same applies to the furry community. I know in my heart and soul it’s just people. 

But in the presence of them I panic. I can’t see their faces. I have no idea if they are friendly or want to kick my ass. Or worse. All I see are costumes and that terrifies me. 

I don’t know why honestly. Wish I could get over it."

The available lyrics were:

“We already know how this ends”.

Very operatic and very drawn out. Absolutely heartbreaking and my friend got to see this guy live and if I could contact my friends I could tell you the artist and song name. 

I don’t know either, I just know I can’t hear the song without crying hysterically."

My childhood was a living hell. 

You sound like the kind of kid that would of bullied me. Flippant and completely disregarding the fact that maybe some of your classmates struggle just to make it through their day, without being bullied or mocked.

The moment you are baptized that very first time, whether as an infant or a recently converted adult? No other baptism is required. PERIOD. 

This church is not interested in baptizing you in name of Christ. That already happened. They want to Baptize you into their own version of what they think Christianity is supposed to be. They want to Invalidate you so they can better control you. 

If this is your to be husbands church?

Your should run away now. 

Far and never look back. 

If you stay you will be miserable and unable to hear God at all. If you stay you will become just another statistic. That is not Gods plan for you and you deserve better. 

They waited till the last minute to tell you these things because they figured it would be too late for you to bail. 

ITS NOT TOO LATE.
