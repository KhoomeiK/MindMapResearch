His shoulder comes almost to my hip (I'm 5'8) and he is probably 5 ft nose to tail, longer than average for a golden. He weighs 85-95 lbs (we go in for shots, but he rarely needs anything else)

He's a service dog, so he's out an about constantly, we walk a minimum of 3 miles a day, plus other short trips around to just go to the bathroom. He gets 4 cups of food that is at the recommended macros for his breed. His ribs aren't visible, as that's not breed standard for goldens, but you can feel them without pressing too hard, nipped waist the whole bit. Not a single ounce of fat on him.

And yet when I tell them how large he is they're like ""he must be overweight, you must feed him to much"" 

I'm chonky, but my boyo is not. He already maxed breed standard weight when I got him at 9 months. He's just a huge dude. 

And yeah, no deli meat, no greasy stuff. He gets standard treats, sometimes a bully stick when we're in office at work, just to keep him from getting too bored. The only food he gets that's human food is the occasional peanut butter (all natural no salt no sweetner) and low moisture skim mozzarella when I make a kong. Oh and he likes berries and bananas. But again that's rare and I mix them in to add variety to his kibbles.

People are weird. People constantly ask me if they can give him food and I'm like, no, you can't.  Bc he gets treats for good behavior, alerting (he's medical alert) and in play things like his kong, and then I take the amount out of his regular)"

Maybe read the whole thread. Because actually there are differences in these statistics throughout reporting in the us, italy, china, spain, and even state by state.

I'm not an idiot.

Factor in margin of error and lack of access testing in the US, especially for folks under the supposed ""high risk "" age group (which is actually defined as 65 and under) unless they have a preexisting condition and present all symptoms, and given that our country statistically has a younger population than Italy, this argument of ""well but it's legitimate and other things are not.""
