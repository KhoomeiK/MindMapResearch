BPD,exqxxx9,t3_cu3jhy,1566508557.0,I love this album so much. You have good taste! You should listen to Broods or MUNA next!! :)
BPD,exqmrbm,t1_exqlpiu,1566504499.0,"It takes a lot to open up to anyone, let alone to a stranger. But we have similarities, and we can support each other through sharing our struggles and hopefully heal those broken parts of us. Us girls with daddy issues need to stick together!"
BPD,exqkkw3,t1_exn75tu,1566503529.0,"Yup, I just want to be genuine."
BPD,exqfznu,t1_exqfn0v,1566501817.0,I truly appreciate that. I felt like my comment was a long shot too. Iâ€™d like to keep in touch so I will take you up on that ðŸ’—
BPD,exqd77d,t1_exqbs4a,1566500892.0,"Thank you for sharing your story with me, it means more than you know. I feel heard and I want you to know that you are heard as well. And I think itâ€™s time. Iâ€™m 27, and I donâ€™t want anymore of this conflict in my heart over my father."
BPD,exq9yk6,t1_exq93v2,1566499741.0,"Wow Iâ€™m so sorry for your loss. Substance abuse is difficult for not only the abuser, but their loved ones as well. I sincerely hope you find peace in the good moments you had with your father. I hope to reconcile with my own before I get that phone call...Sending good positivity your way, friend."
BPD,exq84ts,t3_ctuxk2,1566499087.0,"I was getting ready for school one morning and my mother, a Catholic woman, comes in and says with zero context ""I feel like you have the devil inside of you."" I started crying, and said you can't say things like this to me and ruin my whole day before I go to school. Basically sums up my feelings toward myself, although I'm not religious at all, I feel like a toxic person and I just have a disease inside of me that I can never get rid of.."
BPD,exq5t87,t1_expimjw,1566498257.0,"Wow I had the same experience when I was 17 with my dad. He was playing a video game during my visit with him (parents were divorced) and he was getting very upset over it, cussing out the tv while I was watching him play (bonding time). I asked him if he could keep it down, that it was just a game. He turned to me and said SHUT. UP. I went off on him and he just went to his bedroom and locked the door. I told him what a POS he was and called someone to come pick up my brother and I because he has a history of ""blacking out from anger"" and beating people up (my mom). That, along with a collection of other run ins I've had with my father, has resulted in a pretty complicated and rocky relationship now. I wish it were different, but it still feels like that door is locked and I'm still stuck on the other side."
BPD,exq1zhk,t3_cu077z,1566496936.0,"Yes. I start thinking about what a burden this person is to me, or what a burden I am to them. That we're so toxic, and I feel like we argue all the time and we're never really happy. I just wanted to throw down a grenade and blow the whole thing up. But it's usually because I wasn't doing a great job communicating my wants and needs in the first place, or I wasn't accepting my faults/participation in the problem."
