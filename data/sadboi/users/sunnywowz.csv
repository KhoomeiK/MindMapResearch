ADHD,fo5tmgm,t3_g5hie1,1587535303.0,"and i got a 48 hr extension on last minute cause i was freaking out so bad. gosh thank god for accessibility services and lectures who understand you. guys i know you have heard this a thousand times but even if you feel like doing nothing and if this is going to hurt your academics, let your tutor know. let someone who can help you know. even if asking is hard, try with imagining writing an email, to writing dummy email on your phones note and then when you get the ball rolling and let them know what’s happening. chances are they’ll help you out.

i was going to overwork myself and really panic to get my assignment in but somehow i felt like i maybe should let her know, since it is expected of me to be punctual. just explain what’s happening. it’s better than balling yourself up and crying without a sound on the floor thinking you’re not ok. it’s ok not to be okay. but it’s not okay to suffer alone. If you are not feeling good, you deserve the help. it’s normal to ask."

The Gspot swells and i need clitoral stimulation for a proper squirt. In my opinion, any woman can. Sometimes when i reach orgasm i dont squirt. I personally dont think that i need to squirt to have an orgasm because usually i am more relaxed on my on to squirt like multiple times. It has a lot of reasons to it. One being it my own place, mt own bed, trusty comfy towel, fully juiced tools, and good music. I am particular sometimes.
