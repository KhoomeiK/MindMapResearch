I had to return that book to the library before getting past the first few chapters, so I can't speak to how the book frames BPD or those who live with the disorder. 

*Crazy Ex-Girlfriend* is quite exaggerated, as it is a comedy/musical series, and though the character is only diagnosed with BPD, I think the case could be made for CPSTD, as well. The series specifically deals with the character getting a diagnosis, receiving treatment, and how their self-concept changes over the series.

In *Nurse Jackie*, the eldest daughter, Grace, is diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but I think a case could be made for CPSTD. Her journey through diagnosis, treatment and growing up, is one of the subplots in the series. 

There is a documentary, *Look At US Now, Mother!*, that I vaguely recall making me feel like someone had CPSTD, but it's been a long time since I've seen it.

Staff can't override the time limit towards the end of the day, which patrons don't understand.

If it logs them off, however, and they try to log back on (patrons are entitled to two one-hour sessions daily), it will tell the patron that they already have a reservation.  Staff cannot view the reservation, and when we try to make the patron a reservation from the staff console, we have to override, as it will also tell us the patron already has a reservation.

The print feature was not working with our pay stations or copies, and it was so terrible that we're putting in a new system and new software system wide.  My library system gave it about two years to see if we could get it consistently functional, but it was not, and staff and patrons had MANY complaints during the process.

Exaggerated startle response is a symptom of PTSD, and when I pointed that out to a coworker who had been chuckling every time I reacted to the sound of the phone, they approached me with a lot more sensitivity after.  I was safe to have this exchange with my coworker, though.  They were ignorant, not trying to do me harm.

Just remember that prioritizing your feelings doesn't make you a nut job or an asshole:  you don't owe anyone else your time or energy, especially if you don't feel comfortable with their behavior.

In interactions with new people who give you those red flags:  I have found that placid, polite, and short responses, leaving little room for further comment or questioning, can work well with folks who are pushing boundaries, if ignoring them isn't reasonable or safe in the given situation.   It can force their behavior back into socially acceptable boundaries, or makes them get very bored and decide you're not worth their time.

Part of what is helping me cope right now is the fact that I am looking for other work, so I don't feel nearly as stressed out as I have when I felt ""trapped"" in a situation with an unpleasant personality type.  It may not be reasonable for your situation to look for a different job, but if it's a possibility for you, consider it!  Sometimes, you just need to leave.
