bipolar,fib6wvo,t1_fib36j1,1582315854.0,"not currently. my rn is treating my bipolar 1 but she recently gave me a prescription for Vyvanse that i havent filled yet.

and i have an idea, i love biking. its something i do when i go to the gym and ive had a bad day. ill just bike for an hour straight. ive went on a 15 mile bike route with my boyfriend last year and it was fantastic. but the cold weather is a buzz kill"

bipolar,fib1v6t,t1_fib1la5,1582312908.0,"thank you. youre right practice makes perfect. i just gotta stop wearing my heart on my sleeve. i used to pride myself on that but its not been kind to me.

im gonna screenshot this so i can reread it when i feel anxious."
bipolar,fib1n1y,t1_fib0uct,1582312776.0,well im big unsure of myself but i understand what you mean. i just need to remember not to take things so personal.
bipolar,fib1dzt,t1_fib0izb,1582312637.0,if i had a magical wand my job would be recreational therapy. i want to help people be happy by doing things that they enjoy which is kindve ironic considering i dont know what i enjoy. i used to love weight lifting and became a certified trainer but now i dont care about fitness. ive tried crocheting but my adhd makes me lose interest quickly. i like writing but i never push myself to do it like when i was a kid
bipolar,fib0d4t,t1_fib04sm,1582312031.0,"usually just binge watching tv shows but my new job will be so slow that at times thats all ill be doing there.

my boyfriend helps push me to go to the gym but i dont exactly have any hobbies"

bipolar,fhfwkn6,t1_fhfvcyt,1581553009.0,"i‚Äôve definitely been trying to workout more, i‚Äôve really been enjoying the bike getting my heart rate up. i‚Äôve noticed being around family helps make me happy and the daylio app has helped me learn more about what effects my emotions. so i‚Äôve been updating my daylio 3 times a day and visiting family as often as i can. thank you for your kind wordsüíï"
bipolar,fhfv3kr,t1_fhfruu1,1581552002.0,thank you. its been hard. i‚Äôve had to keep myself from using nicotine as a replacement
relationship_advice,fhe86fz,t3_f2nzfg,1581516340.0,"she could be going through an episode? definitely doesn‚Äôt excuse her actions but this sounds exactly like what happened to me and my boyfriend of almost 4years went through. i didn‚Äôt physically cheat on him but you do alot of dumb irrational things when you‚Äôre manic. we had other problems in our relationship but my episode definitely caused the break up.

but we‚Äôve been back together now for 10months and we‚Äôre happier and communicate better than we ever have.

take care of yourself. limit contact and maybe seek counseling. but what I‚Äôve learned over the course of my short life, nothing is black and white and just because a door has been closed doesn‚Äôt mean it cant be opened again. Just my advice."
BipolarReddit,fhdeohy,t1_fhdceml,1581484089.0,"i definitely second this. it wasn‚Äôt like anything i‚Äôve seen before, very original"
BipolarReddit,fh9196t,t3_f1w2qt,1581371607.0,I started taking medicine almost a month ago and I‚Äôve noticed that my anxiety has gotten worse but I‚Äôm also currently trying to get off of Zoloft to get onto Viibryd and they told me that it‚Äôs common to experience anxiety during this period
bipolar,fgt5xkc,t3_ezu4oh,1581099726.0,i hope you do too!!‚ò∫Ô∏è
bipolar,fgt42bg,t1_fgsgkdv,1581098612.0,"exactly! and it‚Äôs like when I get mad I know I‚Äôm being ridiculous and I am in the wrong but still fuck you, and also fuck me. i mean ive really never had a sense of self. like who i am, what i believe in. i‚Äôve been in every phase under the moon. I was even a vegetarian for eight years for environmental reasons. but my last manic episode basically shocked the whole sense of self ive built up since getting removed from a bad situation 5 years ago and moving in with my boyfriend.

Wow... now I‚Äôm rambling. Maybe im just high but i think i should read this out to my therapist and get her professional advice. Thanks"
bipolar,fgt37xe,t1_fgro570,1581098110.0,Fuck yeah for being a fighter. nobody understands the constant every day battle that it is to live with this disorder. sounds awfully clich√© but it‚Äôs true
BipolarReddit,fgqyidu,t3_exvzr4,1581034208.0,"its like a 20 pound weight on your chest at all points of the day, forcing yourself to do things even though you don‚Äôt want to because you know you have to. its finding content in your own misery because its all you have. Driving to work every day hoping that something will jump out in front of your car. fantasizing about hurting yourself to finally have the people around understand how much constant pain you‚Äôre in so you can finally get some help without feeling like a fraud.

The lows can feel like anything to anybody but this is what it feels like to me."

BipolarReddit,ffg0n48,t1_fffn7n8,1579895897.0,"i‚Äôve never taken any of these medications so i‚Äôm not really sure which could be the culprit. I just know that the xanax seems to help more than klonopin. But i have been sleeping alot more, i hate naps and ive been taking one everyday."
BipolarReddit,fff1stq,t3_et0rnt,1579873359.0,"i kinda say both because even though i dont know who i am, i dont wanna be known as bipolar but i also want people to know the severity and that it is apart of my identity at the same time. im not sure who i am but i know that ill always be/have bipolar so its something to grasp onto."
bipolar,fen3swh,t3_eq028k,1579276345.0,"this is literally me. i had a 4.0 and was a semester and a half away from my associates degree. But my manic episode forced me to drop out last spring. Now i have to pay 500 dollars before im able to go back, be on Academic probation, and reapply for financial aid. I had half of it saved up thanks to christmas money but due to my recent hospitalization for depression i had to use the money on bills."
PublicFreakout,femq9yw,t1_fekqpsi,1579266436.0,"can people not press charges against things like this? either against the whole department or the officers involved?
Not just in this instance but anytime cops do something unlawful?"
unpopularopinion,fel1udd,t1_fekg7kr,1579212235.0,this comment kills
BipolarReddit,fedj2wl,t3_eoexpl,1579012805.0,"You‚Äôre not alone. Having bipolar makes you feel like you‚Äôll never have a normal day without either mania or depression but you will find your peace and it doesn‚Äôt have to be a permanent one. We will always have episodes but the longer you live with and treat your disorder the more your triggers will make sense. You‚Äôll notice when an episode is going to start and you‚Äôll be more prepared with the tools given to you by your therapist and psychiatrist. You‚Äôre doing great by just surviving at the moment, if not for yourself than atleast for your son. One day you wont have to just survive one day you‚Äôll start living. And until that day i encourage you to seek help. We‚Äôre here for you, you‚Äôre not alone, and you are loved."
bipolar,fdy9q42,t1_fdwwkz4,1578777526.0,i definitely agree with the person above. Be happy and don‚Äôt feel guilt for the happiness that comes you‚Äôre way. Just because we‚Äôre diagnosed with bipolar doesnt make your happiness any less genuine. Try to keep notice if theres anything off and definitely catch yourself before falling down the rabbit hole. But if you‚Äôre happy then Just Be Happy.üíö
BipolarReddit,fd3r4uk,t1_fd3q5ny,1578161004.0,honestly i feel more unsafe during a manic episode. atleast when im depressed i know its me and ive never been as close to ending it as i was this past april during my manic episode. i just feel odd lying when i know if i was atleast honest then they could help me with my actual problems.
