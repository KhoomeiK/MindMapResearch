cosplayers,fofi1mt,t1_fofhcrn,1587736333.0,"Wood glue should work with paper really well. Make a base for the paper using tin foil, crunch it into the shape you're trying to make, keep checking with the cane you're using to make sure it doesnt get too big. You can really condense the foil so it's pretty solid. Then if you have masking tape, use that to help make it more solid/ keep the shape. Then thin layers of wood glue and paper, newspaper is pretty good, building up the surface. After each layer let it dry thoroughly or it'll become a soggy glue mess. Make sure you're sculpting the shape as you go, work it how you want it to look. On the last layers, use a pencil or toothpick to make feathers/ give definition before you paint. Consider painting a thin base layer, and then build it up.

At least that's how I'd do it with limited supplies at home."

AmItheAsshole,foffwii,t3_g72ody,1587734986.0,"NTA, but it sounds like your wife needs some help. She truly believes she has helped your daughter, because she herself has past trauma. Please help both of the ladies in your life with this one; your wife so she can heal, and your daughter so the cycle is nipped in the bud here. Remind her she is beautiful, and no two people are the same. Weight can be lost and put on. Teach her that it's natural, and that there are healthy ways of managing it.

I was a fat child (13 stone at 13 years old), and I have had bulimia in the past. That vicious little voice came hard for me today, and I managed to win. Your wife doesn't realise that little voice is beating her, and if she is going to be able to move past it, she needs help."
