The drainage hole had a little grate in it to keep stuff from falling too far down. So my hamster fell in the hole, blocking the drainage piece, and when the water was emptied into it, the water just kept building up which created a little well that the poor baby drowned in.

All I want is a one piece bathing suit with a high neckline and sunflowers on it. But bathing suits are either bikini, or not bikini. And when you choose not bikini, they still try to make it a bikini by taking two small pieces and stringing them together at the sides, or making a giant dip right between your boobs, or having ridiculously low necklines. I HATE it! I just want to swim without worrying about everyone looking at my boobs. I've been wearing the same suit for 6 years that I got as a lifeguard because it's the only one I've found that feels comfortable.

We've had a bobcat come and decapitate one and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

Since this happened we've made a much more secure area for them and they're much safer, but when our newest ducks were smaller these big birds would come circle the pen, waiting to come gut them. I'm very against killing any animals unless absolutely necessary, but whenever a predator is in the area it's a relief to know that we could save them if we needed to. With as much land as we have, simple traps don't usually work because animals can easily avoid them no problem.
