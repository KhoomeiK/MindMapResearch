siberianhusky,fpoy52x,t1_fpnw4xy,1588792669.0,"Yea I had to find him a new home with people who were willing to work with him. After he bit me, I knew what I had to do. I’m never getting a male husky again. Females only. We’ve had only females before and never had this issue. Until we got a male. Apparently from what a vet said, it was a major dominance issue. We are getting a female husky in a few months and I am going to enroll her in obedience classes immediately too. Even tho I know she won’t be aggressive like the male I just had to rehome.

Also, he was never like that towards me. He would never growl at me. Only at my kid and occasionally at my fiancé. So I was really shocked when he did. What happened is he wouldn’t stop growling at my daughter (even tho before that he was being so good all week and all the sudden he got hateful, she wasn’t even bothering him either. She was literally just standing “too close” to him while messing with a puzzle on our puzzle table and he was laying under it.) So after he growled at her for the 5th time, I told him he needs to calm down and I gently pulled out from under the table to put him in the bathroom as a time out. I had to “walk” him in there because he wouldn’t go on his own. The way I did that was i kept my hand as a guide on his back and my other hand on the scruff of his neck. I know for a fact I wasn’t hurting him either. I had to do it like that because he is a 35 pound dog and I’m weak as shit. When we got into the bathroom, I got down on his level and I told him he can’t keep being mean like this. But as I was speaking, I went to let go of him and he bared teeth at me and fuckin bit me! I guess because he knew that he was in time out. Idk. But I couldn’t believe it. 

All I know is that if he is willing to act like that to me even tho he is never a jerk with me, then there was no telling what he was capable of doing to my kid, someone he really doesn’t like."

And his aggression started the day I got him, but I didn’t notice to be true aggression until a few weeks after, he was almost 3 months. That’s when it actually became aggression in our eyes. Also, can you not explain to me why he’s like that? You obviously know so much more than me, so why don’t you enlighten me? You said I won’t listen, but I just asked you to tell me what you think it is. You also didn’t tell me how to fix it. I’m asking you to tell me. And if you posted a comment on someone’s post that was simple and had no ill intentions when saying it and whole bunch of jackasses jumped all over you for saying it, what would you do? Just let them assume the worst about you? Because I don’t let people assume shit about me without trying to correct them first. But hey, since you’re so much better than me, please tell me what I should do miss perfection. I fixed his aggression for the most part, but I guess I did it wrong. I didn’t know you knew so much about me! And by the way, those two times he bit me where the only times he was ever aggressive like that towards me. He talks back occasionally to me and my fiancé but that’s it. But since you know so much, I guess you know who he is aggressive towards? 

Wait, you don’t know. So let me tell you, his aggression transitioned over to my kid. It took a few weeks for it to get worse and worse.. until we noticed it being aggression at almost 3 months. 

But I guess you knew that right? I guess you made the assumption that his aggression was towards me. Did you assume that I was beating him and that’s why he’s aggressive? 

My husky is 7 months now. He doesn’t growl at my kid much anymore. Me and my whole family have been struggling with this problem for months but it’s gotten better. His aggression I believe is genetic because it started so young and randomly. It got worse over time, but puppies shouldn’t be like that from the moment you get them. But no one can really figure out why he his aggression is towards my child, she is as sweet as she can be, so I know she didn’t hurt him. We’ve had to deal with heartbreak of almost having to rehome him at one point because it was so bad that she couldn’t get near him without him growling. We had to keep them separated for a while because of that. But we finally got it to stop for the most part. 

So maybe that’s why I’m so defensive, because the situation I’m living in has been incredibly difficult and emotionally draining and sad. My patience is thin with people like you, you dissect every word, make all types of assumptions and judge immediately. When you have no clue what the person is really dealing with."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fp2ozhq,t1_fp2nets,1588265471.0,"I mentioned 8 weeks, because that’s when it started for me! It was literally the day I got him that he started this behavior. And please explain to me how it’s poor raising when he isn’t nearly as bad as he was? And his aggression is practically gone. He still has his moments on very rare occasions. I still consider him an aggressive dog, because he is. But he hasn’t had an aggressive moment in a long time. 

And I’ve spoken to animal trainers and vets and my fiancé worked at a vet for 5 years. Every single one of them blames either the breeder, genetics, or he’s the kind of male husky that’s just a jerk. Because this started at such a young age. Just because my dog is aggressive, doesn’t make it my fault. 

And since you know so much about animals, maybe you can tell me why he snapped and growled at me as soon as we got him? He was doing this very thing to the corner of a wall and before that under the couch. I went to see what he was doing. And both times he snapped and bit me. First time, literally an hour after we brought him home, second time, the next day after we brought him home. So, why don’t you enlighten me and tell me why. Maybe you’ll have an answer different from everyone else. And why don’t you tell me how you would fix it? I fixed it by positive reinforcement. Would you fix it by hitting him? Because hitting makes it worse. 

You make the assumption that I am raising my dog in a shitty environment when you know nothing of my situation. You know what they say about assumptions, right?

By the way, I’m being defensive because you assholes keep making assumptions about me when all I did was mention to the OP that this behavior looks odd because of my own experience. But I guess y’all have nothing better to do than to try and tear down a total stranger who literally did nothing wrong. Like I said to someone else, it’s like y’all get off on being shitty on the Internet."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fp2jtir,t1_fp2h8n9,1588262982.0,"If you knew anything about dogs, you’d know that snapping and biting at objects at 8 weeks isn’t normal at all. And as a matter of fact, I’ve spoken to several vets and trainers about his behavior and they all tell me that they think something is not right with him. Then I’ve also had other people tell me that it’s just a male husky thing to be a jerk. Kind of like you, randomly being a jerk. Does it make you hard? When you talk to someone over the internet like that? I could see it being a weird fetish of yours. 

Oh and if I made it worse, then please explain to me how I have made his aggression practically disappear. Wait, I’ll tell you how! By spending a fuck ton of time with him, training him and doing hours of research so I could learn the best techniques for stopping aggression in huskies! 

But you can’t believe that, right? I’m just too stupid to understand how dogs are and I just made it worse.. even though he is a wonderful dog now. I guess I’m hallucinating his good behavior. So his aggression stopping must’ve just magically happened over night and I couldn’t have possibly fixed it. I only made it worse, right? I guess people would rather believe that than what is actually the truth."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fp2iah8,t1_fp2c6va,1588262230.0,"Oh okay! Well that makes sense then. Now my husky would just randomly start doing this out of nowhere.

AnimalsBeingJerks,fp2hoaa,t1_fp2fxzv,1588261929.0,"Giving advice? I said I’m not an animal behaviorist. So I could be wrong and hell maybe I am wrong. At least I can admit that. But from my own personal experience, this kind of behavior looks a bit odd because my husky did this at a very young age and it evolved into aggression. 

Did I say this dog was going to kill this persons whole family? No. But for some reason, you take it like I did say that. But let me repeat myself in case you didn’t read my comment correctly. I said that this behavior looks ODD to me. 

Not “this puppy is aggressive! Kill it with fire!” All I did was say it’s odd behavior. And guess what? I’m allowed to say that. 

Oh, and I already know what you’re going to say to that. You’re going to insult my intelligence or try to say something hateful but at the same time try and sound clever and then after that say “I’m allowed to say that.”

Also, from how your behavior is to strangers on the internet, I’d say your mom gave birth to you by pulling you out of her ass. 

Seriously, get over yourself."
