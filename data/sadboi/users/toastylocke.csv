In my own case one of my close friends has urged that if I ever get the impulse to Google symptoms to forward him my concern so he can ask his mom who is a nurse. She is refreshingly no nonsense and has seen it all, haha."
Anxiety,f0kmo60,t1_f0kmd4c,1568682822.0,"I'm sorry you went through that, glad to hear you're in good health. It's wild what we can convince ourselves of and how preoccupied anxiety is with hypotheticals that the concrete information right in front of your nose never seems to be enough. I must have gotten 5 opinions from doctors who didn't seem concerned my issues were neurological and yet I was convinced because someone on some forum had similar symptoms and never followed up to say it turned out ok lol. 

Not to say you shouldn't advocate for yourself if you have concerns, but it's funny how anxiety has an insatiable appetite for more information/reassurance."
