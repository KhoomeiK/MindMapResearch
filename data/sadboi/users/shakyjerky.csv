mentalhealth,fkukr4w,t3_fkrym8,1584551221.0,"Short answer: yes. Why? Because you’ll be able to better manage what ever it is you suffer from. And there really is no time process in which you get “cured” because if you suffer from things such as depression it only gets better with time. From my experience I’m a much more aware and not a danger to myself since I’ve started therapy. And I’ve been going for 3 years now. I still will continue until I feel like I can live with it on my own. Edit: and yes it is private, it is illegal (at least in the US) to share any information about your sessions."
mentalhealth,ff4ddmo,t3_erbb2h,1579560955.0,Like some comments here it’s not a taboo in my country but taboo in my family cause they are South America where it is taboo. I’ve been severely and seriously hurt mentally by my family and we all just forget about it. That’s why everyone always feels tense near each other and it sucks. I go to therapy in secret to try and understand what normal emotions and how to treat people actually is like. It’s sad. Really.
