Since I started with her yesterday, today would be day 2, and tomorrow day 3. So would it matter that Harry is still unpacking or could he be moved out tomorrow?

Follow-up, do the days for the Amiibo villagers ever reset? Like say if Harry can't leave tomorrow, do I have to start the process over with Freya or can I invite her again and just have her move in?"
AnimalCrossing,fr4evs3,t3_gjoq8z,1589886002.0,"Can I make a villager move out with an Amiibo if they're still unpacking? 

Nook betrayed me and sold a plot to Harry (of all crankies... really?) and he isn't here yet but I need him gone.

Can I use my Freya Amiibo to make him move out tomorrow, which would be his first day on my island?"

Your initial villagers requesting for you to help them upgrade their houses like you've upgraded yours would be a great bonus and doubly so for folks who really like and kept their initial villagers!

AnimalCrossing,fqn2o3k,t1_fqkookl,1589487649.0,"That makes a lot of sense, and I hope you don't think that how you feel isn't valid because it is. Regardless, I hope when you come back, you get to find some fun aspects of the community that inspire you instead of bring you down!

Last thing, as far as bells... If you have enough to pay off loans and do projects, you have enough! But if you want to make more without playing the stalk market (I also find it stressful and only participate here and there), there's money to be made in trades! You should check out trading subs and sites like nookazon and see if being a trader would interest you. Okay, long ass comment over lol... Take care!"
