Since I started with her yesterday, today would be day 2, and tomorrow day 3. So would it matter that Harry is still unpacking or could he be moved out tomorrow?

Follow-up, do the days for the Amiibo villagers ever reset? Like say if Harry can't leave tomorrow, do I have to start the process over with Freya or can I invite her again and just have her move in?"

Last thing, as far as bells... If you have enough to pay off loans and do projects, you have enough! But if you want to make more without playing the stalk market (I also find it stressful and only participate here and there), there's money to be made in trades! You should check out trading subs and sites like nookazon and see if being a trader would interest you. Okay, long ass comment over lol... Take care!"
