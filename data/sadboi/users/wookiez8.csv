stimuluscheck,fnfdxa3,t3_fyv2nh,1586906221.0,I have gross earnings as a professional gambler that gets me into the 90k AGI bracket. However after itemized deductions my actual income is far within stimulus 1200 region. My 2019 AGI is easily under 25k can I still file my 2019 today to ensure I get a check? Still confuses how AGI is viewed for schedule C people since numbers are inflated before itemized deductions. Any response helps thnx!!
