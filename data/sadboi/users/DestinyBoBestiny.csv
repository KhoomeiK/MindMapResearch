In twisting the pieces around mindlessly walking to my bed and dropped it. I looked down and it's gone. I remember thinking about how it's not an item that would bounce far or roll. My floor was completely empty. How could it not be where I could see it! I had an old house bed by a popular company in the 90s I think called ""play school"". There was no ""under"" my bed. I was confused about it for a long time. I remember trying to logically think where it could have landed, but there was no where it could have been. Idr if it was weeks or months.

Not unexplainable, but freaked me out. For a moment I thought I was crazy. I was in a pretty toxic and controlling relationship and also dealing with postpartum. While in the house alone, I all the sudden started hearing this loud static buzzing. It put me on edge all day. I was already struggling with keeping up the appearance of being happy, but now I had to live with this buzzing and pretend to be ok with that too. I was completely afraid to tell anyone about my mental health. I went on for hours like normal. Eventually a friend called on their lunch break, and asked what that buzzing noise is.

Why do a lower damage option?

Trying to keep the play style simple enough for young kids, but still make the game work and make sense has been kind of a bigger task than I expected. Things keep popping up. I do really like the idea of making tokens!! I was going to commission a wood worker to make some abacuses, and that was gonna be some $$$. 

Rn I made the game versus because we already kind play that game, but with no structure and no end. However, I e been thinking we should be a team with against a bad guy. And I can use a dice and a coin for the bad guys turn. The dice to say damage and the coin to say which player is attacked.

Some people don't connect well to kids. It's completely different when it's someone's niece they see at family gatherings than one your living with and responsible for. 

It's unfortunate for the children that their mother neglected and ditched them. That she didn't find it somewhere in her to own up to a piece of responsibility, other than sending money later. That's a selfish individual, and probably a reason she's not a person for kids. 

There's nothing that can be done about other people though. 

Divorce is important, and all that. However the father of my older 2 siblings raised his hand in court and gave up his rights. However, later he was still allowed visitation because he wanted it.

It was actually really helpful listening to music that put my emotions outside of my body. It made them less overwhelming. 

For awhile my daughter was semi-suicidal? I say that with a question mark because it came from her dad dying at a young age, and she missed him. She didn't really want to die, but she felt like if she was dead she would see her dad again. Then there was a series of cutting. Always around big holidays, or big events (like when she transitioned to middle school.) Again, related to her dad. She said she would get so trapped in her thoughts, that the cutting was like a shock value to bring her back to reality. 

We REALLY worked on coping skills. 

She started doing a think where some days after school I was let her color on herself with washable markers. Each color represented a different emotion. She could tell me about it, or not. It was really just because art can be a stress reliever, and it was something she could do to her body. 

We have a puzzle, and sometimes when she's crabby in a way I can tell is related to tiredness, hunger, or stress (she's just unusually snappy) we have a puzzle table. I will send her to timeout for 10 minutes and she can either sit there, or work on the puzzle. This normally relaxes her. 

I normally make her journal. I've never read it, but I do make her sit down and write. I told her I don't care if she just sits there and writes a story, or scribbles, or says nasty stuff, or one sentence about her day. I just want her to get things out. 

I try to get out of the house to do things with her more, and this really changed things the most. We go out twice a month now. (Once each check, mostly to the dollar theater, or out to eat.) I try not to nag on her this time, and I avoid stressful conversations. We kind of just chill like girl friends. Sometimes I'll talk about how I'm stressed for a test at school, or training for something new at work, and that helps her open on about her school stuff too. This has changed our relationship a lot, and in turn I see her being more positive. If I get a week that I work a lot and we don't have time together, and can now actually see her stress and crabbiness increase. 

I bought her a skateboard. A couple kids in the apartments had one, skate boarding still has the rebel stigma. When it's nice I like to suggest she go outside to practice. She's gotten a lot better!! She spends a lot of time googling tricks. It also gets that exercise in. 

We do family therapy every two weeks. In home. She also has an individual therapist she See's every two weeks. So one week is individual with one therapist, and the next week is family with a different one. Sometimes she will be crabby for a whole week and insist nothing is wrong, but there is something about having a dedicated time and place with a mediator that unleashes all sorts of feelings and thoughts."

AskMen,fjemrlv,t1_fjef9dm,1583274534.0,"As a single mom, semi agree with this. If she doesn't have time for herself, she doesn't have time for you. There are plenty of times when I'm like, ""At this moment it would be nice to have someone."" However as a single mom who is also in school, I mainly realize that a relationship just isn't realistic. They take time, energy, and attention, and I don't feel like I can respectfully give what someone would deserve in a relationship. 

I'm not sure about dating for child care. I guess I can see some women doing it. I mean, heck yeah it would be easier if I had someone else that could pick my kids up from school and stuff like that. I'm just not the type of person that can comfortably unload my responsibilities though. I'm not sure how other women get men to do that."

depression,filw481,t3_f8h394,1582511762.0,"I once slept in my car for a better job out of town. I could afford a new place yet, or to move all my stuff. So I just put it in storage. Storage + gym membership < rent. I was able to save a lot of money. So much so that sometimes I miss it. üòÖ But it helped get me into a new position, and into a new town. 

I have friends though that would never feel comfortable leaving our hometown. I understand it's not for everybody."

They could also gain short term abilities, but I'd pair them with a negative effect too. Like certain drinks made them hover a little bit, but they were dizzy and have double vision.
