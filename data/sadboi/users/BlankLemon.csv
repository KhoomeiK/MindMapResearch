>A psychopath (or factor 1 ASPD) is a person born with the genetic predisposition that causes said individual to exhibit antisocial behavior (manipulating, cheating, lack of guilt/remorse...etc).

>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

>A sociopath (or factor 2 ASPD), on the other hand, is a person born with a typical neurological network but due to a high stress environment or trauma such as severe abuse, neglect, or prolonged trauma, the brain thus shuts off their empathy circuits as a defense mechanism basically because relating to others causes the subject significant pain. It is pretty agreed upon that the time period for that to happen is between 4-9 years old and that it MIGHT be genetically rooted. So they have the infrastructure to feel things like empathy and love; but it's very dulled out. Which explains why sociopathy has a much larger spectrum in observable behavioral patterns.
