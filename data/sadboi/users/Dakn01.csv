depression,f0gdi0r,t3_d4pn7l,1568597804.0,Classic case of fake it till you make it.
depression,f03tk3v,t1_f03teya,1568369703.0,"Hey that’s what I’m doing. It’s not so bad. Okay that’s a lie but hey, at least you’re not alone. Take it one bullshit day at a time, and seriously, enjoy the little things. While you’re still here, go out and kick ass. Say fuck all and buy a plane ticket to the first place you see. Just enjoy things while you still can. That’s what I’m trying to do."
depression,f03t96e,t3_d3mytz,1568369342.0,Are you asking how we cope with the injury itself? Or how we’ve kept living knowing we’ve failed at killing ourselves?
depression,f03t404,t3_d3mzdk,1568369168.0,"If you want to feel slightly better about yourself, I have no friends, I’m a high school dropout, and until I get the willpower to get a job, I’m going to continue to sit here on a couch browsing reddit, watching Netflix, and playing xbox. Just like I have been for the past 4 months. Seriously, it may seem unhealthy, which I guess it is, but you gotta just take time for yourself you know? Don’t feel guilty. Take the time you need to be lazy and unproductive, and then when you feel you’re ready, go out and kick ass. You got this."
depression,f03sy24,t3_d3mgfa,1568368962.0,You wanna talk?
depression,f03svga,t1_f03sr2s,1568368869.0,"Sorry if that came off harsh, I just use humor to block the pain. I really do hope you find something to live for. Nobody can make you stay but yourself. You just gotta make the most of it ya know?"
depression,f03sr2s,t3_d3mqe2,1568368712.0,"If it helps, I give a fuck. As another clinically depressed human being, I really do know what it feels likes to just want to slit my own throat. And it’s like, nobody can really do anything about it. They say they want to help. But you know they can’t. You’ve made up your mind hat life sucks and is pointless and you’re just gotta get the courage to fucking die. I’m right there with you. But until you and I can actually do it, let’s just be friends and try to enjoy it the best we can. We’re gonna kill ourselves soon anyway so what’s the point of being all depressed beforehand? Might as well go out with a bang. (Literally lol)"
depression,f03skkg,t1_f03sgz6,1568368499.0,"On a more serious note, I’m kind of in the same boat. The only way you can answer that question tho is if you’re apart, or believe in, some sort of religion. Otherwise you’re like the rest of us. Clueless and just trying to survive. It’s the little things. Random vacations. Getting high with friends. McDonald’s at 3am. Idk why I’m here, but until I get the balls to kill myself, imma enjoy it the best I can."
depression,f03sgz6,t3_d3mpjd,1568368375.0,K but you just quoted Rick and Morty and that right there is a pretty damn good reason to live.
depression,f03se6m,t1_f03saas,1568368287.0,I’ll take a look at it!
depression,f03cfow,t1_f03cd9z,1568351504.0,Well above all else... thanks for saying my life is valuable I guess lol
depression,f03cby7,t1_f03c3jj,1568351391.0,Are these reasons not to kill myself or are they just things you enjoy lol
depression,f02wvem,t1_f02w5gt,1568339841.0,Thank you for this
depression,f02smb1,t1_f02s9bd,1568337333.0,"That’s interesting... you’re actually the first person who’s said that to me. Most people think I’m going to hell if I do it. Then again I’m surrounded by a bunch of self righteous cultists but that’s beside the point.

On a separate note, I am truly sorry for your loss."
depression,f02sb77,t1_f02s2gp,1568337143.0,You gonna share or what?

legaladvice,f02prps,t1_f02l4vd,1568335619.0,"Yeah I think that’s what’s going to end up happening. I don’t want to get either of us in trouble, I just feel bad she has to put up with everything."
legaladvice,f02pni6,t1_f02lj9k,1568335550.0,"I think she’s tried talking to them before, but I’m not sure there was enough “evidence”. But I’ll look into it further, thank you! This is such a difficult position I’m in. I really don’t want to make things worse for either of us."
legaladvice,f02pj2q,t1_f02l4w0,1568335478.0,"That makes sense, thank you."

AmItheAsshole,ezynqya,t3_d31cjt,1568271438.0,"Good for you!! NTA at all, just because she “claims” to be a body-positive activist, does not make her so. She’s probably just jealous you’re actually healthy. As a thinner male who constantly gets those same sort of comments that you do, I’m glad you put her in her place."
wholesomememes,ezxynvm,t3_d2wu1x,1568253038.0,As nice as that is... I can’t help but think maybe that’s the reason he’s homeless...
depression,ezrdn6d,t3_d1pdvh,1568072316.0,"20M and honestly, I don’t have any words of encouragement. But I feel the exact same, and a lot of other people do too. If you’re anything like me, then that doesn’t help. But maybe it does knowing you’re not alone. Luckily I found love, but I’m not sure how much longer my girlfriend is going to put up with my crap. It’s gotta be hard for her watching me give up on finding a job or even just waking up. But I’m here for ya OP if you ever just need to talk or rant."

AmItheAsshole,ex3yxyv,t1_ex3ys6u,1565994764.0,Oh I don’t doubt it. It’s been pissing me off and I don’t even work there. I can’t imagine how her coworkers feel. I feel so bad for them.
AmItheAsshole,ex3pggt,t1_ex3p9g7,1565989172.0,"Yeah, I’m with you there. I need to talk to her to figure out what’s going on, because if she’s just being lazy then that’s not something I’m going to put up with. But if there’s actually something wrong then I want to be there to try to help."
AmItheAsshole,ex3njb2,t1_ex3lsnh,1565988363.0,She hasn’t been checked as far as I know. She has low blood pressure so she really does pass out if work is too strenuous. But other then that I see no logical reason why a hurt finger or shoulder should put her on bed rest.
AmItheAsshole,ex3n8q9,t1_ex3lpwr,1565988242.0,I was starting to worry she was just playing it up to get me to support her. But clearly I’ve overlooked this as a possible psychological issue.
AmItheAsshole,ex3n3re,t1_ex3lor2,1565988186.0,It would be if she was my employee. She must have a very lenient manager.
AmItheAsshole,ex3mrjo,t1_ex3m6m8,1565988038.0,"No worries, I appreciate the outside opinions, as I have no clue what to do anymore. At first I thought I was just being too much of a tough guy, but from these responses, it seems possible that there’s actually something bigger here that I was unaware of."
AmItheAsshole,ex3m7mm,t1_ex3lrde,1565987796.0,I’m starting to think it’s a little bit of both lol.
AmItheAsshole,ex3m00o,t1_ex3l7xf,1565987702.0,"That’s something I’ve been debating myself. I’m no shape to be supporting her financially, so if this continues how I fear it’s going to, we’ll have to get her psychological help. I didn’t even realize this could be a psychological issue."
AmItheAsshole,ex3lgpu,t1_ex3l6rn,1565987457.0,"I didn’t even think of that, I’ll definitely look into it more, thanks!"
AmItheAsshole,ex3lbrh,t1_ex3l130,1565987394.0,"That’s what I told her. As a manager myself, I told her how bad that looks to employers. She didn’t like that lol."

AskReddit,erwiw6h,t3_c44wjk,1561344973.0,"When you intently listen to someone talking and actually engage in what they’re saying, then when it’s your turn to talk they only half heartedly pay attention."
