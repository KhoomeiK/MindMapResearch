I was born in 94 so whatever fuckin age I was for 3rd grade (dude its quarantine I'm drunk I'm so sorry) I only grabbed panty liners under my moms sink because she had ovarian cancer and had a hysterectomy so didnt have pads or tampons. I thought the panty liners were pads. For like 2 days I changed them every 2 hours until I finally broke down when I thought I was bleeding too much and my mom cuddled me (rare for her, stoic mom, I cherish it) and told me it'd be okay.

Bless her deaf and stoic ass she bought me pads and taught me everything girl scouts didnt and all of a sudden I felt like a women (lmao) and was so confident. Until the emotions kicked in. And then at 12ish interstitial cystitis and endometriosis kicked in! Woah! But this Tuesday, the 19th, I'm having a Laparoscopy done! First ever, but huzzah! Relief!

I hit 5 '5"" small C in 3rd grade and thought I was gonna be a super model until I literally never grew again and watched everyone surpass me over the years.

Thank you, and yeah I'd 100% be dead or in jail if I never got pregnant.

As far as suboxone I tapered from like 12mg a day (8mg is one strip and the usual dose in case you're unfamiliar) down to 2mg a day, which once you split up the strip that much it's a tiny piece. So I made the jump at 2mg. Not to alarm you but it was hell for about a month and another 2 weeks of just my body recovering. I'd rather have gone thru herion WD twice than ever do it again. BUT, I have heard of people taper all the way to like .5mg and not feel anything when they make the jump so ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I think the fact I was on them so long played a factor into why it was so bad. When you decide to get off (if it's legal in your state) head over to r/kratom and see if that seems like a good thing to help you with WD symptoms. Kratom hits the same receptors as opiates but you gotta plan it out cus you can become dependent on kratom as well.

> gotta go EVERY DAY!‚Äù But I was also sitting in my car risking arrest waiting on dealer time for hours every day

That's actually a really good point I never thought of lol.

Hopefully Ryan hits his rock bottom so he can start climbing back out. It's really sad, especially cus his son is old enough now to watch the show and understand what's going on. His whole addiction and being a shitty parent /spouse is being documented for the world to see.

Congrats my dude/tte!! 

I always had ""friends"" when I was off and on clean going to the methadone clinic, I remember one in particular was clean for probation on methadone but was still selling H (I was a customer) and I hung out with him and his GF for a bit after buying some and asking if I could shoot up in his car (think I was homeless att) and they both described how amazing methadone was and his like 90lb GF (pretty much what I was, 95lbs 5ft5 back then) nodding off from the methadone. I remember even people somehow getting it and selling it. I remember never trying it cus the thought of having to go EVERY DAY to the clinic to get my dose was annoying. With subs it was once a month, pee in a cup, your clean, heres a bunch of fucken suboxone/subutex. 

But yeah your description sounds spot on from what I heard from friends. Basically legal heroin and you cant (or I assume *its hard to* ) OD on methadone, same as suboxone. 

Anywhoodles, stay clean. I have been since I found out I was preggo back in 2012 (had 2 or 3 relapses since birth) and I can tell you it's not worth chasing the high. I don't have impulse control and I gotta say, idek how I'm alive. So many times I woke up in strange places after ODing only assuming I was okay because i didnt feel any pain *down there* since I was surrounded by a bunch of Male ""friends"" in my friend group. I'm off suboxone since 2014ish and it was hell getting off those too but worth it. I still struggle and crave like crazy, but its not worth it in the end. Kinda rambling here. If you ever need support or want to talk about anything shoot ya girl a DM!

Regardless, you seem like someone who enjoys the outdoors, maybe looking for a pup to come along with you on your adventures, but also enjoy coming home, getting cozy and plopping on the couch to play some Zelda or Mario."

Idk if it was a wig or not but I can understand if it was her real hair, to not keep that light of a color up. My hair is light blonde and dying it ANY color here and there (at a professional salon) does damage."

RandomActsofCards,fmrigb5,t1_fmrhc6o,1586324185.0,">even though it‚Äôs been years, it still smells good

It really did! I genuinely thought it was a pretty card with perfume/  cologne on it!

>I got a laminator and went to town

Holy sh...you made it?! It really looks store bought and now I'm even more grateful D: you could totally sell them! 

>As far as the stickers - I made them! I designed them in photoshop

Also...holy crap. They're so pretty! I only have a laptop that weighs about 20lbs but bless my dad for gifting it to me years ago, it runs ok but only windows XP. Maybe someday soon I can afford a PC [with my marine biology degree ;) ] that I can make cool stuff like you do on! 

I've had 2 others already reach out about personalized sender stickers but by all means, if you have any suggestions let me know! My uncle (who lives with my family) has a printer so I can at least print paper labels off of it!. Regardless, thanks sm! And I love all of your doggos equally I just cant pick"
