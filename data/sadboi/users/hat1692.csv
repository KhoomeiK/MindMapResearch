UKPersonalFinance,fhebkmu,t1_fhdtgye,1581518724.0,"Totally agree, I recently closed my personal and business bank account with them because they're customer service was so bad.

After 5 months a new signatory still hadn't been added as well as an update of address and business name. Whenever I've spoken to customer service I get a different answer and they lied to me for 3 months about their ""signatory system"" being down. 

When I asked to make a formal complaint they said I would get a call back 3 days later from the complaints department. Guess what they never called me back, so I closed both accounts."

YouShouldKnow,f2gewng,t3_dd8ttu,1570229816.0,"I think this is a fair point but as an Amazon seller myself. There are lots of products who reviews are faked or paid for on fiver so always look at multiple reviews. 

However there are reviewers who will only give bad product reviews. I have multiple people who I can prove have never bought my product but given 1 star reviews which are vague at best and amazon will treat it as the top critical review,  which is frustrating as a seller."

In the tasty video they actually added a strawberry syrup to the cupcake but when I did this I thought it was way to sweet. But I guess you could add strawberry flavouring instead if you wanted to amp up the strawberry
veganrecipes,ewdvb47,t3_cnu5p8,1565308386.0,"It was originally a tasty recipe but I edited it because it was way too sweet.

240 ml coconut oil, melted‚†Ä  
240 ml maple syrup‚†Ä

2 teaspoons baking powder‚†Ä  
1 teaspoon salt‚†Ä  
12 strawberries for garnish‚†Ä  
‚†Ä  
1. Prepare the coconut cream by whipping the coconut cream and icing sugar together, until you form soft peaks.‚†Ä  
2. Leave to chill in the fridge until set, for about 30 minutes.‚†Ä  
3. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180¬∞C and line a cupcake tray with 12 cases.‚†Ä

YouShouldKnow,evzhvcd,t1_evz318n,1564958024.0,"I sell on amazon and if you are looking at buying a name brand always check who is selling it.
If there are multiple sellers then the product will not have a trademark on it. Any large company will add the trademark for their products onto the amazon seller account to ensure no third party sellers can sell their items and affect their reputation.
Also if your still unsure check the sellers address, it will show you if their are in your country or based in China, etc.

Also when looking at the reviews make sure there are recent ones and they are verified purchases. There will be a verified purchase next to the review title if it was purchased from that customers account.

If you do see anything suspicious then you can also contact the seller. 

Hope that helps"
