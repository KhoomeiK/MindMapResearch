SuicideWatch,fkuhc4b,t1_fks035j,1584549436.0,"This entire society is set up for you to open your own business and generate gdp for the economy. You can choose to work hard and do that, or work hard and gain qualities necessary to land a high paying job. Entry level positions aren‚Äôt going to pay as much as, say, an engineer would. There‚Äôs multiple reasons why the employment market would value an engineer over that of, say, a caretaker. The unfortunate reality is that a high schooler can be a caretaker, while the number of certified engineers is much lower. One other thing to consider is how much revenue each respective position generates (not much from the part of the caretaker). 

We live on a rock floating through space where you can step outside and get eaten by a mountain lion. Starvation, disease, war... Nothing here is free. If you despise the supposed injustice so much, you have an opportunity right now to make a difference. You‚Äôre not going to change the system but you can make an impact on many individuals lives with your life. Look at Bill Gates, the number of children in Africa who he has given a second chance at life to is literally countless, can you really say he‚Äôs evil when there are people (individuals) today with full bellies and robust immune systems literally only because of his good will. From a measurable perspective, Bill Gates is a far more benevolent person than you or I. 

As a species we have a capacity for egalitarianism, but we don‚Äôt live in the utopia where all your needs are taken care of for free, we‚Äôre still probably a couple hundred years away from that. In the meantime you can choose to participate in the society you‚Äôve been born into, and with that participation make positive changes towards a better society. For example, I‚Äôm working 57 hours every week (and I‚Äôm thankful for every one of them), I want to open up my own business, and then donate a good portion of my profits to charity. I can mope about all day about how the rich don‚Äôt give enough away or I can get off my ass and do it myself (in the latter scenario I‚Äôm actually doing tangible good, while in the former I‚Äôm literally doing nothing to make a difference). 

You only get to live this life one time, and you have the power to make the most of it. The world keeps spinning either way, but you can make it a better place if you work hard enough. It‚Äôs not going to be easy.

Your ancestor, the first people to decide to ride a horse, do you think that was easy? But look where we are today because of them. I like to think of that in my moments of weakness. We have the fire of the god damn human spirit in us and nothing can stop us, just remember that, friend. You CAN make a difference."

Personally, I will take classes if necessary in order to reach my goals. My ‚Äúmantra‚Äù here isn‚Äôt that college is necessarily bad, I just think entrepreneurship is better than working for someone else (in most cases). I would literally rather starve (and have) than concede myself to a lifetime of servitude. 

If I could be a research scientist instead, I would, but that‚Äôs contingent upon me doing ungodly amounts of homework, forgoing my social life (something that money cannot buy), and I also have to prove that I actually have original ideas in the form of getting multiple research papers published, ideally before I even finish my PhD. 

Changing peoples lives for the better in a big, scalable way is also really important to me, so from my perspective I‚Äôm left with three options: 

1) I can become a research scientist and help to discover some innovation in one of the aforementioned fields.
2) If I fail in becoming a research scientist, I could potentially pivot to accounting and become an accountant for a charity I deem worthy.
3) I can develop the innovation I have come up with and hopefully save some lives, while also being the primary shareholder of the associated company. 

Option number one is, by my measure, not only probably incredibly hard to achieve, but unfortunately the incentive of helping people isn‚Äôt enough to make me work as hard as I possibly can, it seems as though I need some form of money incentive to reliably access that. 

Options two sounds boring, doesn‚Äôt it? 

I am doing option three. Once I accrue enough capital, I will also be opening up a retail chain in my hometown to fall back on if I fail in my ultimate goal.  

Good luck to you as well, friend, best wishes."
