My driving test was in the morning (my anxiety is always really bad in the morning) in a car I had never driven. The instructor herself saw how overly cautious and nervous I was, but it worked in my favor because she told me I was one of the most cautious drivers she'd ever tested, and then passed me. Congratulations, and drive safely!"

She was a lesson, a really harsh lesson but you'll learn so much about yourself and life through this. It's tough, very tough. I almost ended myself so many times over my ex.. but I lived, I learned, and I moved on.. don't rush it, it took me 2 years.. (although I would let her back in when she was lonely, she had control and knew it) but one day, I thought less of her, and more of myself. Today I have a girlfriend who I love, makes me happy, supports me, reassures me constantly (having an ex like this gives you ptsd believe it or not) and is all around an angel. You'll find your angel, and things get better. Don't give up hope. Love yourself. We all love you and are here for support.. do t let her win. Much love!"

Then kill them. Well this guy high five'd me, so I gave him a pistol out of the chest and expected to be killed, but wasn't. We ventured to the circle, sharing minis and ammo, as if it were duos. We engaged one opponent before I got kicked for teaming. I don't know your name, and I don't know if you're reading this, but thank you bro."
