Also been suggested to try Valerian Root or maybe Lavender for anxiety. You can find teas and such with those too"

Psychosis,f8pd0se,t3_e191kc,1574699500.0,"Yes. I 100% relate to that. I’m a sophomore in high school but at the very end of freshman year I ended up manic undergoing treatment for severe MDD (despite being on a combo of Zoloft and Lithium). After the depression that happened after the mania and I evened out after a bad mixed ep, stability is boring to me. I’ve been in a depressive slump for most of November / end of oct. and am now kind of leveling out (I think) for the rest of winter but damn it, I miss my mania and think about inducing it often, especially now that I’m off meds, I feel like I just need a little push and I can be on my way. I just find stable such a boring place to be and my academic performance hasn’t gone back to the same place before onset."
bipolar,f7zobsx,t3_dy5hu3,1574113662.0,I love it! That's awesome! I have something sort of like that but not really. Just a container with a string of fairy lights that looks like a vine if that makes sense. It's really pretty and I would totally buy one of those.

bipolar,f5ntzc8,t3_dobw52,1572304150.0,"I did this too... felt amazing and colors were vivid again, etc., except I got surprised by my psych and she gave me the ok to stay off of them!

Talk to your psych and treatment team and see what they recommend or think you should do. I think that’s the best idea even though your psych might not be terribly happy you quit them cold turkey (I know mine didn’t appreciate it!) 

Also I’ve heard withdrawal can be a bitch. I was on Lamotrigine and Lithium and I for some reason didn’t get any withdrawal from that or SSRIs when I had to stop them almost cold turkey thanks to switching into mania."
BipolarReddit,f50mf6r,t1_f50c60w,1571929617.0,"I’m kind of enjoying this movie like world and definitely enjoying the euphoria. 

I saw my pdoc yesterday and she said that I can stay off the meds. I was also told she doesn’t think I’m bipolar anymore, which is a bit confusing since I went from a diagnosis of severe MDD to BP 1 w/ psychotic features and now I’m better? But I’ll take it if it means my “mania” is normal and healthy and I don’t have to be bipolar for the rest of my life."
BipolarReddit,f2c9wh3,t3_dcv8tt,1570135825.0,"I feel awful, energy is gone, almost like a deflated feeling, and I get nauseous. Oh! and terrible headaches."
BipolarReddit,f0ub23w,t3_d6g571,1568937187.0,"No one from my immediate family has been diagnosed with BP from what I know. I’ve been told my dad shows symptoms of it but from what I know he’s never been diagnosed with anything. I don’t know any other information from my dads side of the family since he was adopted and that factor remains unknown. I’ve been diagnosed with BP 1 w/ psychotic features, although tbh I think that’s more severe than what I have experienced 🤷‍♀️.I don’t think he’s going to blame anything on you, I know don’t blame my diagnosis on whoever had the genes. 

If he does have bipolar then I think the hardest thing for him will be school and the social aspect, at least that is what the hardest thing is for me as a high school student. I had to go to the psych ward last year which ended in me missing a big chunk of the school year. After that I was treated with SSRIs for MDD which sent me into mania and I failed my finals and had to complete classes over summer. That also took a big toll on my friendships, I ended up pushing a close friend away who was a really good support for me thanks to paranoia and sending him messages at midnight telling him people were out to get me. As long as you’re there to support him and make sure he’s got the best treatment possible. My psychiatrist has said that fixing it while in adolescence can greatly lower the severity in the future. Being medicated and feeling kind of different from my friends sucks, but it’s easier to manage. 

I’m also on Lamictal and it’s helped me especially with the severe depressions. Lithium is supposed to keep the mania under control. 

(Sorry if I went off on a bit of a ramble)"
BipolarReddit,ezs6wqf,t1_ezs4bsh,1568083796.0,"Unfortunately being a minor everything has to be approved by my parents, I can’t just choose to not go to school or have a note be given to my teachers and I know my parents aren’t going to allow that. If I miss school like I did last time again and/or go the psych ward again they’re planning to move me to a different school, which would mean a fair bit more stress to be added. I could ask for some med changes but tbh it’s not too bad now and my parents/mom have to sign off on meds and she isn’t too on board with meds. She’s agreed to keep my current psychiatrist because she said I was in remission and could come off meds in 9-10 months and so she wanted to wait it out till I can end treatment. I’m taking lithium but my dosage and blood level are very low (300mg, 0.3 blood level last time I got it checked). Like I said it’s not bad for the moment, I just was wondering if there was a way of letting the mania go while keeping up with school work, since Im very distracted and too... well manic + grandiose to do any work or think I have to do any work"
bipolar,ezltyia,t1_ezltl8e,1567981529.0,Yup. I was there earlier this year. I got yelled at by one of the nurses on staff for having a shampoo bottle in the shower after we were supposed to turn in our contraband. I’m 15 but there were some 10-12 year olds which slept in our side of the ward and in the guys section there were some really young kids too.
bipolar,ezltgc1,t1_ezlrtem,1567981314.0,I left mine with my parents when I was transported from the er to the psych ward. I would think adolescent psych units would be more lax too but apparently not.

bipolar,eyujnbj,t3_cynpad,1567463937.0,"Apparently I’m in remission and I get to go off my meds (Lithium + Lamictal) in 10 months if everything goes as planned/I continue to be stable!Tbh I don’t even know if my psychiatrist knows what my diagnosis is because I’ve had psychotic mania and very severe depression which sent me to the er/psych ward but I guess since I’m still in high school and my brain is still developing it’s hard to diagnose and treat. For some reason I can’t stop thinking of ‘treat’ as in a dog treat when I write it. I was told it was bp1 with psychotic features by my therapist + psych but then they say I can go off meds in a few months and my parents think I just had a teenage breakdown earlier this year and then the antidepressants sent me into a very elevated mood. I’ll be fine off of the Lithium, it’s done literally nothing at this dose so I don’t know why I continue to take it. I guess that’s it? Hopefully I’ll be off on 10 months if I continue to be stable. My therapist thinks I might be hypo or elevated or whatever but idk who’s telling the truth or not because I have 3 or more different things I’ve been told from different people. 🤷‍♀️"
BipolarReddit,eyf2n1p,t3_cvy4s2,1567042527.0,"Yes. It happens to me as well. Im normally very sensitive to sensory input, especially light, sound, and touch. I also notice I’m even more sensitive to everything when I’m in an elevated mood, and less when I’m depressed. At times it seems like I can feel everything l, hear everything and see everything, especially colors but sunlight bothers my eyes more than usual and can give me a headache. I feel my clothes more and if I’m wearing my watch or ring I have to take it off sometimes because I can feel “too much”."
BipolarReddit,eyf1zh7,t3_cvzit3,1567042257.0,"I talk to myself but it’s mainly me talking to myself in my head. I seem to be able to make an entire conversation and think the words like I’m speaking them aloud. Sometimes I’ll stop for a minute and the “other person” in my head will say something and I’ll interrupt and go back to talking. I’m get nervous when I talk to people sometimes/am very introverted and have an anxiety disorder so maybe the talking in my head is like an internal manifestation of the pressures speech/talkative behaviors of hypomania and mania. I’m not sure, it’s something that I thought of to explain it 😅

I have talked aloud to myself but I don’t do it very often. I do use an excess amount of gestures when I’m talking to people and am like that. I also find it easier to talk to people when hypo and am not as nervous and more “loose” when I talk with them."

BipolarReddit,exgfm95,t3_cso8ds,1566262815.0,"How bipolar affects someone varies person to person. For some people, their cycles are seasonal. Mine are more on the “random” side, but although they seem random a lot of the time, they are often triggered by something like stress or lack of sleep. Episodes can also be brought on by abruptly quitting medication.

Stability can be achieved, or periods without depression or (hypo)mania. For most this includes a combination of medication + therapy. Type one usually requires medication, and most with type two also take medication to help them reach stability. Another type of bipolar which is Cyclothymia doesn’t always need medication to stay stable. 

Bipolar cannot be cured but it can be managed. I am fairly new to bipolar and from what I’ve heard bipolar cycles can get worse over time, especially if unmedicated. My cycles now have tended to spike up more than down, but it started with an awful months long depression. 

Also, it’s not a stupid question, but mania is usually euphoric or irritable, to the extreme for both. For me it’s either, or both. Some mania can have psychotic features. I experience psychosis in mania but not everyone who has manic episodes does."
BipolarReddit,exdsm4b,t3_cs5zno,1566185478.0,For me one of the first is extreme fatigue. All of a sudden I feel tired all the time. It’s usually one of the first symptoms of depression that I have and it’s noticeable if it can’t be attributed to a med change/life situation or sleep deprivation.
BipolarReddit,ewnqdc3,t1_ewnolpa,1565586503.0,"Well, I took 1 blood test for lithium (been on it for a couple months) because my dose is too low. Although I kind of quit lithium cold turkey recently. I have to go back on it about a week before I see my psych because she wants to up the dosage to 600mg because 300 is basically ineffective. I feel better/the same without the lithium as with it so I might bring up stopping it altogether. 

I’ve only been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety in the past. I believe anxiety stuck around but treatment for depression did not go as planned so I’m guessing that’s out of the window. I’m just wondering what else they are considering."
BipolarReddit,ewnnps5,t1_ewnl86i,1565583853.0,"Yeah, that’s what I got when I turned to google. I’m just not sure what else they think it could be. Treatment for MDD didn’t work out, what else could they be considering?"
BipolarReddit,eurb224,t1_eud0mvk,1563991823.0,"Yup, this sounds pretty accurate. I was diagnosed with MDD and GAD and went on two SSRIs, first Prozac (which did not work at all and did absolutely nothing) and then Zoloft (which activated me and sent me flying to the other end of the mood spectrum). Although I was taking Lithium at the time for the suicidal thoughts, Zoloft sent me into a hypomania which was immediately recognised by my pdoc and so I stopped the Zoloft as fast as we could. If the episode had stopped there, then it would have been considered medication induced, but since it continued for a while after and got worse to the point of psychosis (the entire thing was 1 month), I believe it was considered a manic episode. Even then I do not believe I have a formal diagnosis of bipolar, although that might also be different because of my age, but they switched me to medication typically used for bipolar (Lamictal + kept the Lithium). Talking to your psychiatrist is the best plan and making sure they are aware of all of this."

Psychosis,etzed5h,t3_ce3x5e,1563330646.0,"Yeah, unless you have had psychosis or have a genetic predisposition to it I think it is probably unlikely to happen. Also symptoms of depression and suicide are not fun, especially if you're a high school student (I am one myself). Depression and suicidal ideation resulted in a trip to the psych ward for me, which included missing out on a LOT of school and to top that all off I swung the other way into mania and dipped into psychosis before finals."
