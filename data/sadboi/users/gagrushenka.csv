TwoXChromosomes,fr47a0a,t3_gmbx2b,1589878326.0,"I also have BPD and dealt with weight gain while I was on SSRIs too. 

Someone on this thread said to focus on health and fitness and strength rather than weight (and I will add size here too) - this is key to a healthy mindset, and that's something that can be difficult to hold onto when BPD is in the mix. 

I recommend talking to your GP about it. If it gets to the point that your feelings about the weight gain affect you enough, it's important that your GP/team is aware of that. There's a lot of self-loathing that comes with BPD, and disordered eating and obsessing are sadly one of many things in our basket. They also might be able to help you out with creating a routine or making easy changes in your diet or even looking at your medication.  Definitely let them know about the intermittent fasting so they can keep an eye out for you. I'm not saying that it's necessarily something that gets out of hand or that is unhealthy, but it could easily get that way because of the BPD. I'm not allowed to fast (for health or religion) because of my history with eating disorders (I'm basically always on some continuum of recovery, never quite there) and I imagine that any doctor or therapist with a patient with BPD would be wary of them fasting, just because of the link between BPD and disordered eating. It's certainly not always the case but I just think it's safest to let them know so they can make sure you're staying healthy about it. 

I don't think your boyfriend has any place telling you that, especially as he's definitely aware that you've made changes in the last two weeks. Personally, if mine did, I wouldn't be able to tell him to pipe down about it, or stop myself obsessing over it, but I'm going to give you this advice anyway: ignore it, and focus on yourself getting healthy and fit (for yourself!) rather than any notion of getting more 'attractive' or losing weight, etc. If it's about how you look, it will never be enough. 

I go for lots of little walks to help manage my BPD and stay active when I am in a reclusive, no exercise kind of stint. The doctor who diagnosed me said to run like I'm being chased to help keep myself calmer, but a lot of the time running feels like a chore and I push myself in ways that I recognise as unhealthy. Running is always about how I look - when I feel like I look awful it's hard to motivate myself to do something about it rather than think of it as a lost cause. Walking is more about time to myself and time out of the house - it's kind of a way of proving to myself that I can talk myself out of staying home when it's all I want to do. If you ever need a moment of escapism to peace out and shut your brain up, I recommend a nice walk and a lot of stretching after. Flexibility is a nice thing to focus on for health and fitness plus the progression is very noticeable and goals are very achievable."

He had a lot of anger and not a lot of restraint or the intelligence to make sense of a lot of situations (he is intellectually impaired). He wouldn't have the forethought to plan a fight or bring a knife to school,  but he'd certainly grab a branch or scissors if he flew off the handle. He had just had a growth spurt and after a scary incident in which a piece of my classroom furniture got broken, I was very frightened of him and for him (Nice kid, but scary). Every time I noticed something, I reported it to different superiors. There were a few more incidents. I changed schools at some point but I heard from someone there that in a rage he punched a teacher. But this was over a year after I told them he needed help. Nothing was done about it. I was offered some 'support' (I got the feeling they just meant a chat to figure out some strategies for classroom management and to change my perspective on the situation) if I felt too scared to have him in my classroom. I did my job. I reported. A teacher still got hurt. I'd say in a lot of situations, teachers do report on students they think need help because they could be dangerous.

aww,fq4rwzi,t1_fq38p3s,1589082735.0,"The point of standardised testing isn't to compare the kids to one another for the sake giving them an A or whatever but to inform research and measures in our field. Like if test scores indicate that the average student across the state isn't so good at a particular skill in a particular subject, it suggests that their might be a gap in the curriculum that needs to be addressed. If there's a discrepancy in scores for a particular demographic in an area or at a particular school but across classes then it can help that school or region or researchers get funding or realise that there's something that needs a closer look at. Sometimes general improvement in some skills or subjects across particular groups of students of particular ages or whatever might indicate that an intervention is working (something like hearing tests for 6 year olds in x community or whatever or a district literacy program, etc).

Unfortunately, parents and politicians get it in their heads that these tests are for kids to demonstrate their success and learning in specific subjects and to compare against each other and measure how smart they are rather than as a means of ensuring that all students are meeting benchmarks or working towards them and finding where work is needed. All their misguided focus on the standardised testing ends up meaning we teachers have to start teaching to the test and then the data we needed from them gets skewed. For it to work properly, we probably need to stop giving kids individual feedback but then schools can sweep it under the rug if particular kids are grossly lacking in some skills that their parents might be unaware of. Like if a kid in grade 7 can't cross multiply and their parents have no idea because they scrape through maths with other skills, it would show up on standardised tests and the parents can find out why the f no teacher has pointed it out to them for 4 years. Not giving individual feedback would mean the school in that situation could  just turn a blind eye rather than get called out on letting that kid get to grade 7 without being able to do something kids learn in grade 3. 

A big mess,  standardised testing."

Yes, there's a lot of caring in the profession. You always want the best for your kids. But we are easily pushed into going above and beyond because it's seen as our part of our job to do so, and it's not. I want my kids to succeed in school but I should also be able to leave work before 6pm without feeling guilty, even if my planning for the next day isn't great so much as good enough. Every once in a while you get a class that requires two hours of planning and rearranged furniture for a smooth single hour lesson.

aww,fq37a66,t1_fq291zj,1589063674.0,"I'm with you on the improvement on standardised tests, although I don't know about bonuses being tied to it since the benchmarks are always changing to be age-appropriate - so if a kid fails one year at 45% they still have learning to do to hit %45 at the next age benchmark. That fail doesn't mean they didn't learn and that their score didn't improve doesn't mean they didn't learn anything. It can be really tough for some kids to be able to stay where they are rather than falling further behind. I worked a school rated as well below average when it came to socioeconomic advantage etc. Most of our kids bombed out every year on standardised tests so we'd get our school results back with red all over it. But then if you wanted to explore further you could click around on the results and find the improvement and even though these kids weren't passing the tests they were improving their scores in leaps and bounds every 2 years (we test every 2nd year) and getting closer and closer to their grade-appropriate benchmarks. 

I've taught junior high school classes in which a good chunk of the kids have never passed English, weren't even hitting benchmarks in pre-schooling. It's tough to look down at a markbook and see half your class failing - you can't help but think it's your fault, even if you can see their scores from previous years and know that they were well below benchmark to begin with. Sometimes there's a lot more milestones and steps between a D and C than anyone realises. Sometimes getting one tick out of ten in the C column of a marking guide is the immediate goal towards being able to get over the line entirely one day."

Maybe you don't have the wealth of knowledge that professionals do to help you understand how your diagnosis is accurate. 

My mood changes are fast, but so are my brother's and he has bipolar. He also doesn't get 'manic' per se, in the way bipolar mania is typically thought of. His brand of bipolar is more mellow than most, particularly when it comes to mania. We both spends lots of money and we've both had years of messy relationships. He's medicated and I'm not at the moment. To me the two appear to have a lot of similarities - but that's to me, someone who does not have any expertise in this area. I only have personal experience and that's not nearly enough for me to accurately interpret and use diagnostic criteria etc. The DSM seems straightforward but all the terminology in it has a specific meaning within the context of psychology that people without that training and education are likely to misinterpret. 

Talk to your doctor/therapist about it. Explain that you're not sure about your diagnosis. Ask for more insight into why you were diagnosed with bipolar. Ask about BPD and see if they have some insight about that."

BPD,fpxxt84,t3_gg4gkm,1588991792.0,"Agreed. I think perhaps it's a matter of finding a silver lining. Like, would I be so kind, insightful, and compassionate if I didn't have BPD? There's no way of knowing. Those qualities are not unique to BPD, even in the intensity we seem to have for everything. (And, honestly, I'd be okay with being less of those or less of all any other 'positive' characteristics if it meant I wasn't so vulnerable, if things didn't hurt so much, if I didn't constantly feel like I was losing my mind, if it didn't cost me so much energy to be healthy). If it helps people to find positives they can attribute to having BPD so they don't feel like monsters all the time, and it doesn't inhibit their recovery/management of their BPD, then I think it's okay in small, careful instances. When it's bad, BPD is debilitating, and when it's not so bad it's hard work. 

The other thing is that it lends itself to the romanticism of BPD by people who do not have it. I said it elsewhere on here recently - there are plenty of people with multiple exes who have BPD (and legit diagnosed BPD, not just angry dudes on the internet ranting about their 'crazy' ex-gf who they've decided must have BPD). I will always say this: we are especially vulnerable to people who want to take advantage of someone because of our disorder. How on earth is that positive or cute? 

If we switched out BPD for eating disorders with this attitude we'd be straight down the pro-ana/thinspo glorification of EDs and everyone sees that for the sketchy, unhealthy bs it is. Sure, the nutrition obsession comes in handy for my job (I teach home ec and nutrition is a huge component) but that's no reason to glorify or romanticise eating disorders. Why are we doing exactly that with BPD. Our 10% suicide rate and all the rest of it is not worth glorifying BPD because we're passionate or whatever."

What I want to add is another voice when it comes to manipulation in relationships with BPD. Yes, as someone with BPD, I will admit that when we're unwell we can be very manipulative.

I just want it said somewhere that sometimes the manipulation isn't by the person with BPD.  For many, BPD develops as a response to childhood trauma, including abuse - we know that people who experience abuse as children can go on to be abusive themselves as adults but we also know that they might also/instead continue to be victims of abuse in their adult relationships. 

Also, it has to be said that not all BPD relationships are dysfunctional and the ones that are dysfunctional are not always. There is therapy and help available and it can work, for those with BPD and for those close to them, and also for the relationships themselves."

niceguys,flplqut,t1_flo47lf,1585362547.0,"I did some of my studies at McGill and never once heard of any linguists in Quebec disputing the term 'dialect'. I have to say there's great research done on bilingualism and dialect coming out of Quebec - the universities there have great programs for linguistics. 

If there's disputes over the terminology in French, that's going to be more about the connotations of the terms in French. Words don't translate directly into other languages - the best they can do is as close as possible. To linguists the English word 'dialect' is a technical term. If the closest word in French to 'dialect' has connotations even as a technical term that the English equivalent doesn't, then the dispute isn't over the terms 'dialect' and 'variety' but whatever the French words are.  It gets messy to talk about words from one language using their counterparts in another language because they're never quite the same translated. 'Variety' in linguistics can mean dialect but it can mean other things too. People have individual varieties of speech but those individual varieties are still within the boundaries of a dialect. We don't call those individual varieties 'dialect' because they're not a dialect in themselves so much as an individual variety of a dialect. 'Variety' is a broader term that can apply to 'dialect' but doesn't always. I can't comment on the French terminology - I've only studied linguistics in English (not linguistics of English - we look at all the languages we can - but all my studies have been mediated by English). I can imagine that if anywhere there are linguists who are going to have issues with the French terminology for 'dialect' it would be in Quebec. There's a lot of fear of Quebec French dying out because it isn't valued - or wasn't for a long time - and that sort of thing definitely compounds attitudes to language and dialect. It's an interesting place to be as a linguist because of the bilingualism and the policies in place to preserve Quebecois. It's quite a rare circumstance."

niceguys,flmo104,t1_flls7ln,1585289849.0,"Dialect is the correct term. Australians do speak dialects of English. The main one is called Standard Australian English, although others do exist. 

'Language' isn't exactly what we speak so much as a collection of dialects that can be dotted along some continuum of mutual intelligibility. 'Dialects' are what groups of people speak. Typically they vary by location but there can be other factors at play as well. 

It's not insulting to call Quebecois a dialect of French. It is. Parisian French is also a dialect of French. Both are French. Everyone who speaks a dialect of French speaks French. Everyone who speaks a dialect of English speaks English. No one speaks all dialects of a language.

As a linguist, let me respond to this: "" Linguists are fighting over this but basicaly there is a connotation with the word ""dialect"" implying strong distanciation from the original language, and also implying it's a ""sub-language"". ""

We're not. The concept of 'original language' being important doesn't align with one of the tenets of the definition of language that underpins linguistics. Language is dynamic. It changes, it splits, it grows into new and exciting variations. All dialects are systematic. They way they work is systematic - they have grammar, rules that govern how they work. There's no connotation of 'dialect' as we use it in linguistics that means 'sub-language'. That's a colloquial use of the term that gets used by people who don't understand what 'dialect' is in the way that we mean it in our field. Much like 'inflection'. People say 'inflection' all the time when they mean 'intonation'. Inflection has to do with word-building rather than the way something is said.

 What you're referring to is the idea of 'prestige' and 'devaluation'. Some dialects are considered better than others by the general public (not linguists - we're objective about this, although we do all have our favourite little pets among languages/dialects - mine is Singlish but know better than to think it's better or worse than any other dialect of English), usually because of the demographic of one linguistic community compared to another. For years and years Australian Aboriginal Englishes, for example, weren't recognised as legitimate dialects of English. Teachers scolded kids for using 'bad English' and 'poor grammar' despite AAE being grammatical and systematic. 

The French spoken in France (which one anyway?) isn't the original language. The French spoken in France isn't any more legitimately French than any other dialect of French except perhaps some creoles that lean more heavily towards another language. Maybe then we'd argue that they're varieties of that language rather than French. But then we're getting way too far into dialectology and way beyond the topic of prestige and the definition of 'dialect'."

asklinguistics,fljfizz,t3_fp7aah,1585210340.0,"Do you mean the way semantics is approached by each discipline? Or the semantics of 'semantics' in each?

My knowledge of psychology is very limited so I'm not going there. But as for semantics in both philosophy and linguistics, well, formal logic as it is used in philosophy can be pretty useful in linguistics if you want to look at semantics because formal semantics uses logic as a tool to analyse meaning. Simply put (at the risk of not getting into enough detail), in logic, we try to see if an argument has valid interpretations. Each interpretation is valid or it isn't valid. In semantics, we kind of try to do the same thing but we're trying to see if a statement is true or false given the words it's made from and what they mean. 

I'm not particularly comfortable with the way I articulated any of that but I just can't seem to get what I'm trying to say together and that's the best I can do. 

A number of undergraduate majors in linguistics require a unit of logic from whichever school in the faculty offers philosophy.  Mine didn't but I made sure to complete a unit of logic when I did the coursework for my postgraduate studies and it was very helpful for semantics."

The top of the field in ladies skating are young and they're not usually around for long because by the time they've had a great season or two, there are younger ladies coming through with a larger technical arsenal and less injuries from over-training. Compared to a slow burn, the success of ladies in skating is an explosion.  Samsonov needs to make it to 18 or so to truly be competitive in the men's field - the ladies don't. 

Also, just in sheer numbers - Russia has dozens of Sashas and Annas rising up through the junior ranks. There's a bunch of girls who could top an international podium at the senior level with a couple of months prep, two clean skates, and maybe a birthday to age up. Russia doesn't have that same strength in men's skating. Samsonov isn't so replaceable - they need him, specifically, to last into senior because there aren't dozens more just like him to step in if he bows out from injury - and he's perhaps better off staying in junior for a few more years.
