By what I understand reading that post and its source is that the US has less mass-murders per capita, when compared to say Finland. Which, to me, makes no sense. During this 17 year period this research takes into account, there have been 3 shootings in Finland, and 53 in the US. And yes, when you count how many people died (23 in Finland, 394 in the US) and compare that to the amount of people living there (about 5 million in Finland, about 297 million in the US) Finland takes the lead. And when you compare these readings globally, the US probably doesn't take the highest place.

But then if you count how many people have died divided by how many shootings there have been we get this:  
Finland 23/3 = 7,666...  
US 394/53  ≈  7,434  
So, the US has had 53 shootings, where approx. 7 (rounding down) people have died in each, and Finland has had 3 shootings where approx. 8 (rounding up) people have died in each.

I'm not sure where I'm going with this anymore, but in the end I don't think those per-capita numbers really show what the situation is like."

BPD,fkpzk7h,t1_fkntp15,1584424560.0,"Takes time and effort, just like any skill. On a semi-unrelated point, there is a saying here in Finland: ""no one is born a blacksmith"" -- i.e. practice makes perfect. Just to drive the point home lol. But I believe in you!

On an even more unrelated point -- surprisingly many people have asked me how I got so good at playing guitar, and I'm often like ""dude, I've been playing 13-14 years actively, with no major hiatus in between"". When I first grabbed a guitar I didn't know what to do; I remember my sister telling me to either ""learn how to play or change the song"" when I was practicing the intro to Nothing else Matters by Metallica. Took a few years but I did finally learn it :D"
BPD,fkmxj3l,t3_fjeea8,1584344053.0,"I've spent years wondering if I'm an alien from a different planet altogether, or if I have autism or something, because I've always felt like that I don't belong, that I don't understand people. I thought myself an extremely awkward person, always doing something wrong in social situations. But in reality I am just as adept as anyone else is to be with people. I had criticized myself too harshly, and hadn't noticed how well I actually work with people. The only exception being people of the opposite sex. On first contact I may give a bad first impression because I'll be nervous and stressed. But yeah, this too is a skill to learn, and I have certainly been awkward in the past. Not so much anymore, though."
BPD,fk4d8ox,t1_fk42dnx,1583858159.0,"I was surprisingly calm when I wrote this, despite there being a storm inside. A horrible feeling of anxiety wanted to crush me, and to be honest not so long ago I would have been crushed. At this point I would have had most likely admitted myself to a psych ward. Even longer ago I would have hurt myself. 

But now I decided to take the bus to the city and visit a guitar shop to have one of my guitars re-stringed and stuff. Also bought a second-hand leather jacket and some shoes. 

But now I'm back home, and the feeling of anxiety is lurking there, I can feel it. There is also lurking the fact that tomorrow (and the day after that, and the day after that)  I'm supposed to go to this rehabilitating activity place, the same place where she lives. But I don't want to meet her, see her face, hear her voice. Fuck her. If she doesn't wish to have any connection to me, then let her have it her fucking way. Let us return to the way we were before -- complete fucking strangers.

There is just one problem here. If I don't go there, I will be at home. Alone. With my thoughts. That has never been good for me, I need activities and other people around me to feel alive. Staying at home I just won't do anything. I'll just live amongst my garbage heaps and turn into a recluse.

So, don't really know what to do in 13 hours; to go, or not to go? That is the question."

Sneks,fedxzbu,t1_fedhj0v,1579022260.0,"No, not in Finland for some reason. People can kill them all they want. Apparently there is a European agreement on the protection of reptiles, but Finland doesn't adhere to that regarding adders. There have been some public initiatives for the protection of adders in Finland, but, at least according to Wikipedia, they are still free game (so to say) for people."
Sneks,fectrv7,t3_eo8xsn,1578984303.0,"So this snake is not venomous? I was wondering how people there react to venomous snakes, as here in Finland most people just kill them outright, if they happen to find an adder (the only venomous snake in Finland) in their yard. 

I think it's kinda sad how adders' lives seem to have absolutely no worth in Finland (probably elsewhere too). People fear them a lot, and of course it probably hurts like hell if one bites you, but I don't think they go out of their way just to bite people. I think most cases happen because people accidentally step on them, because of their good camouflage.

Anyway, nice snake"
