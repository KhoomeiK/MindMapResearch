Weed was my drug of choice for dealing with my depression and anxiety and I started using it every day after work when my parents got divorced to just shut my mind off. That was 5 ish years ago. I mainly used it to “help me sleep” - which it did - but was also just masking the problem and not actually helping me improve.

I deal with extremely terrible anxiety and it consumes me almost all day. After being a few days sober, your mind starts to deal with things much more rationally than when you self medicate. I can calm myself a bit easier. I can rationalize better when the bad thoughts start to come. Even after a couple days you start to feel more “alive” if that makes sense. The short term improvement makes me excited for how my mental health will improve in the long run. 

Weed is not inherently bad, but for us it is and you have to remember that. 

You’re on the right track of not making it a grand gesture. Every time I tried to quit and made a big deal out of it, it made it harder for me. Just make some small adjustments in your nightly routine, and don’t think of it as a big deal. Just think of it as, you were driving in the wrong lane for awhile and you’re simply merging back in to the right one. That helped my mentality a lot. You’ll do great and you’ll feel great."

Amy responded to that comment and said “I can’t imagine”. So it appears that while he did abuse her, he didn’t do anything to the kids. 

Also, what do you expect Judy and Benji to do about it?? Yeah, it’s his brother, but it’s also not his story to tell. I’m sure they felt extremely uncomfortable that people would realize something was up, but at the end of the day, it was his brother/sister in law who were **occasionally** featured in their vlogs. Not to mention the legality of it and if there were even ALLOWED to discuss it with thousands of their fans. 

I think you need to chill. Im pretty sure Judy and Benji were just as disgusted and shocked as the rest of the people who personally knew him. Also on Amy’s instagram, is a picture of her and Judy after all this happened, appreciating her for being in her life through this tough time, etc. You have no clue what Judy and Benji have potentially done to try to help Amy.

to people to are feeding us to the wolves at this point. 

We all have to work to pay our bills. Just remember that you are never wrong for standing up for your health and the health of your family. You have that right, and capitalism has molded us to feel guilty for not being there for our employers even when we are legitimately ill. This whole thing is truly disgusting."

Buffalo,fm0z576,t1_fm0iqod,1585669000.0,"What is the reasoning that it says you HAVE to call? The only reason I called is because I had a tech question. After that, I didn’t have to speak with a single person on the phone. I completed the claim completely 100% online and successfully received direct deposit in my account today for last week. 

I feel like the website tries to confuse people into making people think it’s a really difficult process so you just give up? Idk. I did experience the hang up thing a couple times while waiting on the phone but I found that if I went back and tried different menu options it would let me hold for someone. It really should not take anyone weeks to compete a UI claim."

Buffalo,flr4r4p,t1_flmcxnt,1585412951.0,"My job (I work as an admin assistant in a factory that produces jewelry boxes) has told me that they were given the “all clear” to reopen with some “medical guidelines” after only being shut down a week. Since it was shut down to begin with because it was considered nonessential, I’m really baffled. 

I share the same sentiment, this whole thing is not even worth it because we’re doing everything half assed. If we’re going to continued with these blurred “restrictions” then you might as well just open everything back up and say fuck it. I’m glad I have a job again on Monday but I’m scared for my own health and angry because of how strikingly clear it is that our leaders don’t give a shit about us and how other fellow citizens are thinking about this as if THEY control it."

weddingplanning,fklbo52,t1_fkk5n9b,1584302801.0,"Thank you, but I know it pales in comparison to what other near future brides are going through. We kept telling people how happy we were to be “getting it over with” when we did. Kind of felt like a -sliding under the closing garage door- moment.  

We are located in Buffalo, NY. We actually woke up this morning to reports of the first confirmed cases in our county. 

Advice for the current virus situation: Feel out your local officials and guests and trust your gut on your decisions. Don’t absolutely panic, try to keep a level head about everything and definitely try to focus on the bigger picture if you start to feel like you’re fighting a losing battle. We agreed days ago that no matter what the only thing that mattered is that we were getting married to each other and that even if shit hit the fan, our family/the people we love the most would **still** be there. Our reception coordinators were also extremely supportive and nonchalant which helped immensely. 

Advice for the day in general: I don’t really know, lol. The whole thing was kind of a blur. Very hard to prepare for mentally because you have no idea what to expect. My anxiety is a mess though so it probably is easier for some others in that respect.  

I truly hope this is a short lived and that everything is handled as best as possible"

The entire day felt a bit bittersweet because of the world’s situation, and having all the extra precautions from all our vendors, along with guest cancellations definitely felt like a black cloud at times throughout the day but ultimately we are happy we got through it and it’s done.

We live in a relatively small city that hasn’t yet been directly affected, but most of our guests that had even a small risk of exposure were proactive and canceled. 

Now I just hope for the best moving forward"

She’s a part time rad-tech at a hospital since going off mat. leave and at least once a week she takes a couple hours after work and has her hubby or someone else watch the babies for just a couple extra hours for her self to get her nails done, get a fresh wax, her hair did, etc. She NEEDS that to feel herself and refilling her OWN cup makes it so much easier to feel good in her mom role, too!

My 2nd bridal shower is this Sunday, it’s just a smaller group (about 10 of us) that includes just the lady relatives on my MIL’s side, it’s more of like a tea party situation and a more intimate way for us all to get together before the wedding. I’m still going to be receiving gifts at this one, though. 

I’m working on thank you cards for my main shower (that was almost 2 weeks ago) and wondering if I should leave out the ladies who are going to be at my 2nd shower and just wait to write their thank you cards until after THIS one is over? Or should I send two separate ones? It just seems silly to me to write two separate ones for the same person."
weddingplanning,fitwtps,t1_fit5hvw,1582731069.0,"Yup! Bridesmaids want GUIDANCE. As a low maintenance bride myself, I had to buck up and actually make decisions for my bridesmaids, for as wrong as that felt for my personality. It’s easy to think that you’re being less difficult as a bride by telling them “lol just whatever works! I don’t care! Whatever you want!”, but it actually makes it more stressful for them, as you said. It’s fine to leave most little things to their own discretion, but big things like dresses, they NEED direction from the bride or it quickly becomes annoying even though you’re coming from a good place, trying to make it easier for them."
weddingplanning,fitw72h,t3_f9q7ug,1582730700.0,"Yes!! I will say, most of my vendors, ESPECIALLY my main vendor (reception/catering) have been so pleasant. My reception/food coordinator for the beautiful historic hotel we’re having it is INCREDIBLE, like I think she truly would bow down and kiss my feet. 

A few of them though have been straight up rude. Excuse my French, but my florist is a vapid b*tch and it’s way too late to look elsewhere (wedding day is in 2 weeks and to be completely honest, I didn’t have the mental energy to start another search) so I’m just left crossing my fingers that we can get through the day without any hiccups related to her. It’s almost humorous the arrogance she has...like why did you become a wedding vendor if you can’t NOT make things all about you? I swear she thinks it would kill her if she smiled. She’s one of those people that’s decent until shit hits the fan and instead of communicating and dealing with it in a healthy way, she goes from 0-100 in 2 seconds. Like I said, I don’t really understand why people enter the wedding industry if they have absolutely no desire to actually make it a good experience for the bride/groom?"
