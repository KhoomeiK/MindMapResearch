depression,fpixt0w,t3_gdg6bv,1588651285.0,"My depression got me like ""i don't care being beautiful or ugly, in the end I care about my mind which is F**ked up, something which no one sees but it's all what I should care about"""
depression,fpiv1vz,t1_fpitjj6,1588649382.0,"Thank you so much for understanding me. And since you are a first year student, I would recommend you to choose your goal career by your heart and mind, something you would love to do and bring you peace, regardless of the fact that it is small or a big opportunity. I don't want you to regret like me coming under pressure. 
Just do your best and do what you want to do from the core of your heart. Your family will understand everything eventually. 
God bless you."
depression,fpirfpv,t1_fpiqx9a,1588647047.0,"It's like I don't hate it. But I don't love doing it either. I want something simple like the jobs I mentioned above. The point isn't about money, it's about peace that my current job doesn't give me.

Tell me what to do. I am afraid to talk to my family about this as they would think leaving the best job and doing something very less would be stupid of me and unworthy. Tell me who should I make happy.
My father died few years back and since then my family has been expecting a lot from me. Guess ot looks like I am not worth it."

depression,fpgrs26,t1_fpgoj7p,1588608326.0,I wish we could just break from what we are living
depression,fpgm9gc,t3_g9ndgw,1588605438.0,"I myself died at 16. Now I am only left with obligations and responsibilities of my family. I have no dreams. I am just fulfilling the dreams of my family and society of waking up, eating, going to my job(that I landed in because everybody did it, so I should also be doing it to make me look normal, I am a software developer by the way), coming back home and then back to bed. I live in a city.

Well after all this, it made me realize I want peace more than money, love from people more than their expectations from me and support and freedom about what I actually want more than appreciations for doing everything so well.

I wish to live in the country sides, in the mountains, where it is mostly cloudy with simple people and my family. I want to do a simple job like tutoring children or working at an animal husbandry or working as a librarian or working with something related to nature. I don't care about the money. I want to make friends with these countryside people and want to talk about simple, minimalistic things. I have no big dream seriously and I am not ashamed of it.

Basically, having a simple life is my biggest dream that according to society can't be accepted as actually a dream."
