Anxietyhelp,fqtigr3,t3_gkqz3v,1589639649.0,I hope you can find a way to get professional help. Not sure what country you‚Äôre in but I would look into clinics that offer free or reduced cost therapy. I‚Äôve also seen a lot of apps come out that connect you with a live therapist and are considerably less expensive than live therapy. Unfortunately until as a society we start viewing mental health the same way we view physical health we can‚Äôt get resources to those who need it. That‚Äôs how I feel in the US at least.

That said I think it‚Äôs pretty cool that a band with all its original members has stayed successful and relevant for 30+ years. I feel like I grew up with them as silly as that sounds."
