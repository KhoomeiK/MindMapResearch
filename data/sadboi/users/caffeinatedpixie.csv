I have a rescue that's a little wary of different types of treats and wet food, once in a while I'll ""Boop"" a little on his nose lol once he licks it off he realizes it's safe and he can figure out if he actually doesn't like it, but once he tastes it he usually likes it.

StarWars,fovbm20,t1_fovabkq,1588098601.0,"I have to be honest, I watched them all too close together so the lines are kind of blurry. I'm the type who has to watch everything twice (and I plan to) since I get pulled in too fast when I like something. 

However 

Sequels: I loved getting into the backstory and, because I watched them first, it sparked Vader/Anakin as my favourite character. Shockingly I'm not a huge Obi fan (which will probably change when I watch clone wars). I loved seeing Anakin being slowly pulled to the dark side, seeing how his actions were paved by good intentions and how, to him, the Jedi were the evil ones. His character arc was my favourite and I probably woulda lost the plot a bit had I watched the og trilogy first. The only part that really stood out as not okay to me was how Padme died.

Og Trilogy: I was hella pumped, I got to see all the characters that everyone loves so much, the stories pulled me in, and Vader's redemption arc (which I didn't know beforehand) left me a mess, I loved it. I could definitely see why these films were so popular upon release. Coming from someone who didn't have a great understanding of the universe: it was absolutely wild to me that all the pop culture references, characters, and overall hype came from three movies. I didn't understand how mindblowing it was until watching them.

Sequels: I've already posted on this thread, but overall I'm just sad about them. Too many recycled plotlines, and not enough explanations. I was really disappointed in Rey's lineage and the treatment of Darth Vader."
StarWars,fova54a,t1_fov9lvx,1588097909.0,"For all the trilogies? 

For me TFA was pretty decent, when we started it I told my sister it was like ""star wars an inch to the left."" I found it being newer means it lost a little charm, and seeing recycled plot got an eye roll, but I was excited about the characters and where their stories would go, especially Finn"
StarWars,fov9byr,t1_fov8wxp,1588097518.0,"Oh did it ever 
I already knew basic spoilers while watching them all, the whole reason I even started watching was because my sister watched Revenge of the Sith with me in the room and I needed to know what the heck was up lol"
StarWars,fov8vvb,t1_fov8j0m,1588097298.0,I have to agree... Usually I'm fairly good at keeping prequels and sequels at least somewhat seperate from og movies but not this time
StarWars,fov77o2,t1_fov6j49,1588096503.0,"I feel like the sequels tarnished the entire redemption arc of Darth Vader by not including him somehow. I feel like they kind of ruined Luke's character, why would he abandon the only family he has left? He's seen Darth Vader be redeemed and yet his nephew's darkness was enough to have him pull a saber on him? 

I don't believe that Anakin would only step in in the form of three lines at the end of everything. He can appear with the force, those lines showed us, so there's nothing that leads me to believe that he would let his grandson follow his mistakes, in his name, and hurt more people. It doesn't track, for me at least.

Kylo Ren didn't have enough of a backstory, besides his family, or character arc for me to really become invested in him. His true character is only really shown in the last half hour or so.

The fact that Palpatine was brought back (with a random family??) just feels like another recycled storyline to me."

birthcontrol,forxqo3,t1_forwr6e,1588020355.0,"Let me get this straight: your partner didn't like how you acted on hormonal birth control, they didn't like the nuvaring (which rarely causes pain for the male, usually just slight discomfort), they don't like the IUD, and they won't use condoms (it's physically impossible for them to be too small, btw, they stretch enough to be used as balloons and go around arms). Maybe it's time for a new partner. 

I'm not saying his pleasure isn't important, I'm saying his pleasure is also partially up to him, not just you.

On another note: if penetration is uncomfortable for him he should maybe see a doctor and make sure he's okay, especially if he's super sensitive. It may be a health issue and not a preference"
birthcontrol,forsc11,t1_fors04n,1588017653.0,"It seems that's he's found something he doesn't like about every birth control you've used and that's not okay. It may have been 3 minutes of pain but it's still something constantly altering your body and influencing his, not yours. If he's in pain I don't expect him to keep having sex with you but I would expect him to find a way to make it more comfortable, at that point it isn't just your responsibility.

And it does take two to have sex, so if he wants sex he should also be finding ways to make it comfortable.

Edit: I meant suck it up that he finds annoyance in the nuvaring, not the pain he feels from the strings."
birthcontrol,fopp0tn,t1_fope4gb,1587967627.0,"It makes me uncomfortable that he's the one voicing how he doesn't like any of your birth control methods. It's not his body and it's not his choice. I, personally, would tell my partner to suck it up if they complained about me removing my ring before sex. I'm the one who purchases it, I'm the one who chose it for my health and I'm the one doing this so there can be safe sex. 

And I don't think he should be ""compensated"" for you not providing traditional sex, this is clearly an issue that impacts you both. Maybe he can go to the doctor or call and ask for ways to make it more comfortable for him. This isn't all your responsibility, honestly."

I found as she ages her preferences go back and forth (we've also introduced other cats, which was transition periods as well). If we're relaxing on the couch she rarely, if ever, will sit on me, but she has taken to sitting next to me. If I'm sick or sad she's close by. Social distancing has brought about her curling up under the blankets with me (??? New but I love it).

Well, this little mutant frog took on a goldfish that was bigger than him and won, he also attacked another and removed his eye (looked like your little dude), but the goldfish was a fighter so he lived, he did however slowly change from gold to black over time.
