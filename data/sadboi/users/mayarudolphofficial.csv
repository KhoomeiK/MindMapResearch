Enneagram,fmynpca,t1_fmw559j,1586490681.0,"Oh yeah for sure. Thanks for asking!

Well... basically I have gotten into many tiffs with close friends over my inability to see something as good or bad, right or wrong, black or white basically. 

For example, something small, I don’t take sides when two family members are fighting. I just prod you find out more information. And try to empathize from either point of view. 

A larger example, one more complicated and still painful for me: an ex roommate and I lost a friendship over a comment I made over trump. She said he was a bigot (I agree, pretty absolute, ha, so there are exceptions) and she then went on to say that anyone who voted for him is a bigot. I had issue with that, not because I knew anyone personally, but because many voters are ignorant of candidates and vote along party lines or just plain against other candidates (and Clinton did a particularly awful job appealing to lower class Americans as well as farm workers). 

So, there you have it. I have issue with absolutes big or small. No one is bad or good. 

I am Jewish and read a lot of holocaust literature (both fiction and nonfiction) and as much as I hate nazis I don’t hate ALL nazis. And for some reason it’s important to me to make these distinguishing factors clear."
Enneagram,fmsimqt,t3_fx1f8i,1586356218.0,Ugh. Thank YOUUUUUU. much love from a 6w7. Will always contradict you but I truly mean it with love & affection (and I truly do not understand absolutes lol)
Enneagram,fm6uom3,t1_fm5gzp9,1585803769.0,"I, too, am a counter phobic 6 (I do standup, talk to strangers, experiment with traveling etc) and it really screws with people’s perception of me. I am like a walking contradiction with 10 different contradictions at a time. Still, I love being this way. Even if it is painful to constantly be doubting. I love facing things and confronting things head on."

That’s what we thought the CDC recommended to check if we have symptoms. But now I’m getting nervous I just shouldn’t see him at all so that I don’t spread anything just in case I’m asymptomatic.....

This is Hard."

We will not he sleeping together or sharing meals or watching movies or anything for the next two weeks. 

I can’t say the same for my other four roommates and their partners."
internetparents,fkssfca,t1_fksosd5,1584497316.0,"I was thinking about that. I even recommended both the houses quarantine so that in 14 days, if no one has it, we can all hang out and be a little community. 

It got on two other of my roommates’ nerves. THEIR partners live in two separate homes which means they can’t see their partners. 

Ugh, and to think my partner and I were close to living just us two this year. How much simpler it’d be. 

To be clear, we’ve decided to stay separate for two weeks regardless of what others do since it will minimize spread at least a little."

I went into the down payment with my partner, he put in half and I half. I saved up an equal amount of my half to pay for repairs. I’ve already gone to 0. 

I’m really lucky to have saved that much. But holy god if I didn’t have that cash saved I really don’t know what we would have done.

biglittlelies,etu8bps,t1_etsz16j,1563206684.0,MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY! Part of me if hoping she wants to get the truth out so badly to get these women some medals for killing a damn rapist.
biglittlelies,etu87g4,t1_etsvabw,1563206602.0,"Okay agree strongly. I feel like the man was both a RAPIST and a BEATER. literally a wife beater. He deserved to die and if anything Celeste would be covered as pushing him as self defense...? Am I missing something? Because I’m 1000% not a lawyer or a judge. 

But I will say this: my friend in high school was stabbed to death by his brother. My friend was violently beating his brother, so the brother was protecting himself, reached for the first thing he could find. Boom. It was a knife. Horrible. Awful. Everything about it was bad, but he got off. Maybe because they were both under 18? Idk."
