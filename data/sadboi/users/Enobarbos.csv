Now concentrate on other pieces and keep up with the quality of fighting."". 

Now, I never had cancer likr you. Yet, I mean. I think I'll have it eventually. Too much pipe smoking and pshysical exercises with supplements. Eyes are already fucked. Too much reading. But it's fine. If there's a thing I finally learned is that the game is never over until it's really over."

SuicideWatch,fj4ways,t3_fbfbsb,1583018428.0,"A friendly reminder: Unless you are going to do it with somebody else, or have a public death, I wouldn't recommend you state specific dates. This rarely works. Commiting suicide isn't different from mental training to pull the trigger during war after basic training. It's like sharpening a blade. You have a specific moment to act that, if solitary, isn't decided by pre-specified appointments. You may reach the day and don't have the balls to do it. It's quite OK. Happens to the best of us. So, it's a friendly reminder. If you can't do it then, you'll feel even worse."
shakespeare,fj4vmgp,t3_f7hylj,1583017958.0,"Well, I believe Shakespeare read De Bello Gallico. Caesar's expedition into Britannia discusses the pictii, the breton warriors who painted or tattooed themselves for war. I think that Shakespeare perhaps used the term in a loosely manner, just as Nietzsche refers to the french as ""gauls"" in his Ecce Homo, in what regards the conversion into Christianity. I think that the terms were more interchangeable at the time, if even for literary ends. Truth be told, I'm impressed Shakespeare never wrote about Llewellyn ap Gruffydd. Men refused titles in a losing war because ""his people protected the people of Wales since the times of Kamber"". Perhaps it would cause some trouble among the court. But Henry V impresses me in Shakespeare's play  when he tells the yeoman that he is ""welsh"", instead of a Plantagenet norman. Anyway, I think he uses the term in a loosely manner. Or as a way of evoking some kind of heritage from the gauls, who were assimilated very well by the romans. For more information, I'd recommend Pliny, Caesar, Tacitus and reading on Gallo-Roman culture."
shakespeare,fj4uksv,t3_f8y01i,1583017243.0,"Only alternative ending I find fitting is that they commit suicide, the patricians get even more pissed. Paris is mortally wounded but does not die before being found. Juliet kills herself, and Paris, even with his name, that let us agree, is an ill omen, explains before death what transpired, foegiving Romeo from mortally wounding him. Instead of following orders from the Prince, the two families renew their feud into an open conflict, and the city is bathed in blood, each citizen or freemen learning of what happened taking arms for one side or another. This could end like Oscar Wilde's The Son of the Star, where the Son's successor is a cruel king. And the play ends in open, with somebody ending it stating that love saves some and that love punishes others."
Paranormal,fj3sb8n,t3_fbb24x,1582992044.0,"Quite interesting. When I was younger, I'd know somebody would die via dreams. It was never the person I dreamt of. But somebody very close to them. Happened time and time again."
Humanoidencounters,fj1mylg,t3_fakuu1,1582923434.0,"Well, as far as I know, Gray Barker was making a hoax when he talked about the MIB thing. There was an article by a friend of his that I read a long time ago which stated that it was a hoax. I've only heard about the shadow-stuff coming from MIB in the 2000's, to be honest. Now, I don't doubt the UFO phenomena. I'd never doubt something that obviously is happening for a long time. If it's aliens, government tests or something else, I can't say. But I think that some UFOs are indeed military testing of some sorts. And that because of the urban legend, military or secret agencies turned myth into reality. But truth be told, I never heard of MIB out of the US or areas with US military presence. Thus, I'm inclined to believe that if MIBs are real, they are flesh and bone humans who intimidate witnesses who will speak about it later in order to keep the myth and the ""government sees us all"" Orwellian paranoia on people, instead of aliens or inhuman entities. Also, if you look into it, the urban legend shifts with the era. I don't think that any contemporary MIB encounter is real, as other control methods are now employed. But that during the Cold War or shortly afterwards, sending some agent to some UFO resercher door would have a big impact on pop culture, making people more paranoid and making it easier to exploit this for national security reasons. As for contemporary encounters, we have a parallel between this and the BEK encounters, with some people even claiming that the kids appeared at their door with MIBs, or that they controlled shadows or stuff like this, attributes first seen on the now-defunct urban legend of the Slendermen, which we all know isn't real."
