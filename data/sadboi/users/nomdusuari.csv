It did help after a month and a half. Now I’m back in the downward spiral and might need to change it or up the dosage - need to contact my doctor again. It’s been around 6 months, I think.

The quickest effect I saw, was that I was more concentrated in class, and seem to had very little energy, even though I did feel energetic - not sure if I can explain that hahah.

I was very nauseous, the first few weeks. Then I felt very lightheaded. And then absolute calm for most of the day.

Now I feel nothing. Very anxious and sometimes can’t get out of bed. Again. Lol.

I remember I wanted to go downstairs, to grab something to eat (probably a yogurt, because mom was lazy and always told me to not bug her if I wanted something to eat, unless it was lunch), so I went to the hallway over to the stairs, and saw on the wall a tall shadowy figure with a hat.
I felt it looking at me. And I stared back, frozen. 
I was super christian at the time, and mom had always told me to sing this song that said something like “When I am afraid I trust you Lord” - anywho, I was just singing that at the top of my lungs, staring at this figure that was looking at me - and mom ran over to see what was happening. I pointed at were I saw the figure and told her “there is a man”.  Basically, there was nothing, there was noone - but the two of us.

He gave me a family when my own turned their back on me. I miss the routine of each of us telling us “good morning” and “good night”, and the “I love you”s before we had to go to X place. 

But I also miss *him*. I miss looking at his eyes and feeling like if everything around us was fine. I miss telling him everything about my day and showing him my drawings and paintings. He was my biggest supporter, and was the first one that encouraged me to get out or nursing, and pursue art school (Which I’m currently at, and enjoying so, so much).  And I miss that after a minor discussion (just the small ones), we’d hug and I’d later kick his ass playing Mortal Kombat. 
I also miss when we sang together, or hearing him play music.

I try to not go out a lot, to dance or whatever, because then I smoke minimum two boxes on my own - because it makes me feel in control of my mind when I’m around a lot of people. It minimizes my anxiety. In my case, it’s definitely a habit, which I am most definitely not proud of.
