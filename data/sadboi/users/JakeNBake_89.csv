LockdownSkepticism,fpbace5,t3_gah9ws,1588465532.0,"*Incoming ramble ahead:*

I've been anti-lockdown from the beginning, and I agree that the ""shit hit the fan"" moment was when Rudy Gobert tested positive. I also read through the coronavirus sub and seeing all the doomsday predictions of 18 months- 3 years lockdown prediction as well as the news headlines being exclusively about corona, just drove me into a hole of depression. I feel like my life like many others were hopelessly stolen from me. 

I had assumed, judging off data from Italy/China that many of these said lockdowns would end sometime around May, and we have seen places reopen before then. I was hoping to see some optimism around this time now that numbers are declining across the board, but no. It's more panic of a second wave Spanish Flu style, like how can you compare circumstances in 1918 to 2020? In fact, the Spanish Flu wasn't even a coronavirus to begin with!

 I admit, my stance was initially based on fears for the rest of my life, but seeing people suffer under this mentally and financially while many who have the privilege of job security tell them  ""you're selfish, you want grandma to die!"" had only strengthened this stance. Wanna know who the selfish ones are? It's the simpletons who assume that we have the power to maintain a shutdown of society for months for the sake of ""lives,"" but seeing that poverty puts you even more at risk for this,  we'd be practically feeding the virus by the time a vaccine rolls around."

I freaked out that I might fail a class but I had received some closure hearing that the grading system was relaxed to where anything D- or up is passing, but if I don't get a 3.0 GPA I won't end up getting a scholarship and that will piss my parents off big time, so I'm pretty concerned."

When the news spun it in a way like ""omg second wave"", I was extremely pissed off at them. It gives me comfort that a nation that I think highly of has done considerably one of the best jobs out of the world."

Anxiety,fp42yyq,t1_fp40cpi,1588290659.0,"People act crazy irrational in a situation like this, and I feel the same way as you. I don't want to reopen because I'm some sadistic corporatist who only cares about the dollar bill. I want to reopen because I'm worried people will slip into poverty, which puts you even more at risk than the virus itself. I am also worried about disadvantaged people who don't have the privilege of doing everything from home. I do understand that these measures are necessary but it has a point where it is excessive."
