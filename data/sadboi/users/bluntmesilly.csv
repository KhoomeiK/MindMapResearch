Due to my mother, I don't think I can ever trust women. There are men out there that are disgusted by the way these men have treated you. How could you ever know that a man has a pure heart?

LSD,fa2l5ky,t3_e7if2m,1575783432.0,"I also have family members with multiple mental health disorders. I have not been diagnosed, however, I also never searched for diagnosis. I can ""self-diagnose"" just by researching symptoms. I think everyone can relate to some degree of all mental illness symptoms.

I became aware of the symptoms after a handful of mushroom trips (which leads to the research). Acid hasn't helped much as it's powerful. 

I do not regret taking psychedelics and ""opening up"" some of my ""mental illness."" As I believe it is all apart of my journey. Are you already nuerotic and aren't aware of it? Is opening up to bipolar/psychosis just apart of your consciousness expansion?

If I sound like a quack, maybe don't take it. If you are interested in developing your spirituality and self-actualizating, give it a go! 

This is the start of a beautiful journey my friend. Be careful and remember self-love; it can get bad out there."
