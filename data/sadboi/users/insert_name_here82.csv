In the case of this class, I had a bit of a rough transition due to personal reasons outside of school and trying to adapt to the circumstance I was in, but other than that if you just follow through and listen to what's covered in the lecture you'll be fine."

survivinginfidelity,f27ov7m,t3_dbffps,1570042982.0,"Hey man, after reading your story and seeing everything that you've done for her through those years you had together, think about what she did for you. You gave her the world and she posted that world on social media. Clearly you were the stronger person in the relationship and you deserve better than whatever she gave. The first step towards moving on from this is always the hardest, but eventually you'll think about her enough times and you'll get sick of thinking about her. The most you can do now for yourself is to learn to love yourself as much as you loved her because you deserve all the love you gave back. This is a time of transformation for you, use that pain to become the best version of yourself you can be. The love you gave and felt will come back. 

I'm still recovering from my breakup as well and she jumped ship as soon as she ended the relationship. I felt comoletely broken and hopeless. Didn't help when she came back a month later to tell me to lose hope. But eventually I came to a point where I told myself that enough is enough, I couldn't get out of the hole if I didn't help myself. You have to find an outlet to let your frustrations and feelings out naturally, for me that's going to the gym and playing music. And don't force yourself to move on quickly because it'll only be worse if you do. Take the time understand how you and sit on those emotions for a while.

I believe in you man, if you gave the world to her, you can give the world back to yourself. Peace"

I spent a lot of time thinking about why it happened and what I did to deserve this, I went through a dark place. I realized that one of the greatest things to hold through life is an appreciation for yourself and who you are. The strongest hope that we have is the hope for us and a hope for the better. If things work out, then thats great, but if it doesn't you will always have the oppurtunity to be a better version of you and to seek out new opportunities. Just don't let this one pass you by"

If you think about it, the odds of you or I existing, me commenting on your post, and you reading it are astronomical, so why waste the oppurtunity now. I know it fucking sucks sometimes, hell a lot of the times, but eventually there will come a moment when you're going to look out to that horizon and you'll understand whatever it is you want to seek out.

You can't put your looks above everything else, the more you think about it the worse you might feel. Go outside and look around you, there are so many experiences tp be had and things to see, understand that the only person who will take you to go see these things are you.

I guarantee you that above all you have to learn to love yourself in order to feel better about who you are, im trying too believe me. It may not be easy but you need to make a habit of doing it,  these things take time. Take the time to figure out what ypu want to do be it a hobby or a trip and then ask how you can go after what you want. Go out there and get some excersise, it helps me atleast, but im looking out for the long term.

Life isn't fair, its not going to be fair. Thats a guarantee. But it's the life that we've been dealt brother, so use it. I believe in you, you will too"
