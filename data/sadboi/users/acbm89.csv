CheatedOn,fqlwmtt,t1_fql999a,1589467424.0,Hi! Just Downloaded! Thank you. Reading through it. It looks like I was a bitch and then after marriage we flipped that. My love for a family and for him started to grow and grow. And suddenly one day I started to lost myself in the relationship. Being available 24/7 because if family needs me I‚Äôll be there! And I saw him like family.
CheatedOn,fqkzs7d,t3_gjf3ve,1589441363.0,"this is my month #6 and I‚Äôm not crying everyday. I don‚Äôt have anymore extreme pain in my chest and heart. And all I did was. Waking up in the morning and AS SOON AS I got those thoughts about him cheating, how , who, where etc. 
I started staying at loud. I FORGIVE YOU! and repeated that for 4 months. And then I started to see improvements. 

Maybe that technique could help you my friend! 
Much love!! God blesses u"
Divorce,fq9zy7m,t3_ghduhb,1589210301.0,VERY WELL DONE MY FRIEND!!!
Christianity,fpwrhvw,t1_foxamer,1588968637.0,Thank you üôè yes I honestly don‚Äôt agree on stating that adultery the only reason or way out of an abusive marriage.  Hopefully they are not waiting for me to turn the other cheek if my STBXH hits me again.
AskWomen,fpl1k3q,t3_gdl1ce,1588704745.0,Men feel that way all the time too. Ask them too
Divorce,fpkljmq,t3_gdx9tc,1588696832.0,"As everything in life. We are not trained for marriage. As we are not trained for bad bosses, as we are not trained to face the death of our loved ones. As we are not trained for conflict resolution. As we are not trained in almost anything in life. We are so scr&w in society, that not only marriage has to change. EVERYTHING has to change. We are all wrong in our paths. The way we look, the way we work, the way we have a relationship to our loved ones. They way we LOVE. It‚Äôs all about being lost in this world, in this life. Thanks God. At least I‚Äôve found some guidance in the scriptures. It has taken a lot of weight off my shoulder. Is way easier to follow God‚Äôs rules instead of swimming in a dark lake without knowing what to do, where to go, trial and error. I feel my life has become simpler when I reconc√≠liate with God."

Divorce,fp2waas,t1_fp2ks2k,1588268952.0,Mmm well maybe is just a stage where we are tired of hurting each other and we just gave up on wanting to be right all the time. I think divorce is so painful that you feel bad for how your ex partner is suffering as well as you. Sometimes I send him support words. Which is weird.

Maybe you can help me decide if I should take care of this thoughts with my therapist  or is just nothing much important. I mean in the sense of not giving them more strength and trusting this will pass. I don‚Äôt want to make this worse or give more power to this thoughts. Thank you for your help!
Divorce,fjfym11,t3_fd8z33,1583304379.0,Another thing. Is that this thoughts just happened like 1 week in a raw. When I was so lost at some point of my divorce. Then this is getting better somehow. Maybe I‚Äôll tell my therapist. I just don‚Äôt want to make things worse
