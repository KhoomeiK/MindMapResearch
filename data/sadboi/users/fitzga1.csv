SuicideWatch,erwv2i1,t3_c10o3z,1561357563.0,"23 and been going through this for years. I don’t want to kill my self because I‘ll be upset if I fail. My mom would miss me, and I would miss her. I think about getting myself into situations that would get me killed, though."
unpopularopinion,eqffhry,t1_emyzhpu,1560019954.0,"I am saddened that even though there is no such thing as “free lunch,” many aren’t willing to feed starving kids. It isn’t hurt a “free thing” it’s a necessity for growth, function, and a quality life. I don’t think allowing students to eat while they (and so they can) learn forces an agenda. People may not like the idea of the government helping because they either didn’t need it, or didn’t want it, but I don’t see how helping starving children is a bad thing. I guess people want the choice whether to feed other children in need. It just sucks."
