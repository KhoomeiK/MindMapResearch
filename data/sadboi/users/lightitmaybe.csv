I struggle not being entertained without a screen of some kind at all times.

Eating, brushing teeth, or doing errands. This is such a bit habit having being depressed and always looking at my phone."

He does not want to prescribe me that unfortunately.

I cannot see another one as my insurance will not cover that and this is my 3rd and best doctor I've had.

I have heard great things about nardil even with the side affects."

By the time I was 18 I had already tried xanax, weed, alcohol, LSD, MDMA, and I am sure another drug or two.

My doctor is very open and went briefly explained TCAs and welbutrin.

Three days of welbutrin and I feel more tired than before. I hope this helps."
antidepressants,fpqaxvj,t3_gewqs2,1588818791.0,"As someone who has gone through many ssris and antidepressants I can relate.

First RELAX. Seriously, take a step back and don't panic.

First how old are you? I am 22 and had a very high libido before all my meds. Test levels and age play a factor. I am getting my test levels tested out soon. After stopping a antidepressant I gotta wait a few weeks before my libido even sort of comes back.

See your doctor asap. How are you sure of PSSD? Other factors such as mood and diet are big as well.

Good luck!"

confession,fpq78xn,t3_gew5re,1588816576.0,"You're not. I relate to you so much its fucking crazy.

I was about to be a police officer in one of the best and hardest academies in the US. I was close to finishing my undergrad. I had the best girlfriend, great friends, and good money. I using heroin and xanax until I can no longer function.

You're only going to function until you stop being able to. As a nurse you know you'll have to keep taking more pills and a point will come you won't give a fuck about shame. One day you might not have that bottle.

This is a hard situation and finding the solution might be hard if none exists. Try to get some help, outpatient rehab and counseling saved my life.

You got this. You have a beautiful life. Don't lose everything."

If it works for you though I am glad. Kratom helped me for years until I started using it daily. Thank you, please try not to dose daily. Best of luck"
