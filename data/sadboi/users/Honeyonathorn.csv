Imagine it is in minute pieces in the south Atlantic and even if, by some chance, the black boxes were found, it still wouldn’t give more info than we already have.
They probably cannot name suspect but telling families that nothing further can be done is the only fair and humane thing to do. As horrible as that may be to accept, how long do these folks have to wait for ‘answers?’"

The nurses weren’t told till the doctor asked for all the lights in the unit to be turned off, then held the baby with a flashlight to the back of her head. The light shone out the baby’s eyes and you could see the empty skull. Reading that is one thing - seeing it is a lot more horrifying. One of the nurses knew of an anencephalic baby who was alive for several years, being cared for by foster parents. This baby stayed in the unit for days. Don’t know if she lived longer."

Attorney said unless the driver was wealthy and had like vacation home, this is the best I could do. 
Not much money when I have constant pain in left side, unable to work and have PTSD - been in therapy for two years.
So, unfortunately someone is not likely to be ‘set for life’ unless perhaps it is a company truck, and even then I’d say it’s questionable."

I was in an African country where I badly sprained my ankle. Thought it was broken. My friend insisted the driver take us to the hospital to have it x-rayed. 

The hospital was little more than a large building with a LOT of people sitting, waiting to be seen. No x-ray machine, just as driver said. Lots of posters warning of HIV but we only saw one extremely overworked physician who had no antibiotics, no bandages - basically nothing. These facilities still exist in a large portion of the world.

Hopefully she’ll have a therapist to help her through all this, though it does appear she is handling it well - being able to deal with the ureterostomy and colostomy with only a little help. Seems like she has the determination to make this work.
What is done cardiac wise to deal with the hemodynamic stability?"
MedicalGore,fbx0wrx,t1_fbuq5zv,1577165188.0,"Life-saving, yes, but that is not what her life expectancy would be. Besides would she not need chemo, radiation etc. which would make her remaining life quite unpleasant I would think. 
I understand she must have been willing to do anything to buy some time, and that surgery is mighty radical, but it just pains my mind thinking of all she has already gone through - and how much more she may need to go through.
Medicine can certainly perform ‘miracles’ although, especially with metastasis, I think hospice would be my choice. 
I hope she has excellent family support and lives long enough to make her choice worthwhile to her. I salute her courage."

But it wasn’t all the babies dying, and there were a lot in those days - it was the babies who struggled for six months - with oxygen causing blindness, having cerebral palsy, unable to be weaned from oxygen, having suffered brain bleeds - meaning probable severe mental retardation, intestinal infections, not being able to eat and requiring a feeding tube, being on ventilators - and then being sent home! 

Parents overwhelmed, thinking that their baby would be ‘fixed’ and normal- never realizing being ‘saved’ didn’t mean anything close to normal. Parents owing over a million dollars in medical fees, and now with a child needing 24/7 care for the rest of it’s life. Many divorces, other children feeling left out.

Is it really fair to that child, or it’s family to fight sooo hard, for sooo long - and then having that be the outcome. Yes, the child is alive, but not really living. Just existing for the rest of their lives.

That is what made me change specialties. Your mom chose geriatrics, I chose hospice. I still wonder about those children."

You have my total understanding, for what that is worth. And we all feel differently about how much we choose to share about our mental health issues.

It’s really sad that PTSD, like many invisible physical illnesses (fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, for example), are not seen as real conditions, with very real symptoms. Instead it is looked at more as hysteria. Combat vets get a bit more understanding I think.

More like “Get over it already!” - I’m unable to work and although I have received nothing but kind understanding and acceptance, inside I feel like such a failure. Definitely therapy helped - especially EMDR, which I view as a lifesaver - but 3 1/2 years later, I still live like a hermit (luckily that suits me), am unable to work and still struggle with simply getting off the sofa. I give you a LOT of credit for being able to work!
