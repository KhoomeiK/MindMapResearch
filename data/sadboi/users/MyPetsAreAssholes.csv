My hair had been been affecting my mood lately also. Along with mental health issues I have an auto immune disorder that has just recently in the last couple years caused my hair to shed (not in clumps... yet). In my 20s I always wore my hair long. It was shiny, straight, full of volume. I have always avoided going to hair salons because I have so much anxiety around having to small talk with the hair dresser and being around a crowd of people I have to talk in general. I finally was able to MAKE MYSELF GO out of sheer desperation to chop most of it off up to my shoulders. The feeling of cutting off all that unheathly and stringy/frazzled/dead looking mop of hair was liberating. And talking to the hairdresser I ended up with was actually not as bad as I thought it would be. I will definitely be going to her more often and honestly have less anxiety about the whole thing. 

Anyway, rant over :) good luck on your curly hair journey!"
