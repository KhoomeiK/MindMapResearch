When we were little, my grandmother picked out two of her grandsons who reminded her of my uncle as a child and did the same shit your grandmother is.

She treated them differently, and convinced them there was something wrong with them.

When he talked about why he got into the life, part of the reason why was he didn't think the family expected any different from him. Because of my grandmother.

The actions of her son are not the actions of her grandson, but someone that is supposed to be a trusted figure telling him he is fundamentally wrong and telling him that he has no choice, he will be this way, is damaging and can be a self-fullfilling prophecy. You are üíØ right not to believe and you and your mom should definitely make sure to protect him from your grandmother's bullshit."

AmItheAsshole,fkt5m29,t3_fkawk1,1584506955.0,"NTA. Self diagnosis is not valid for pretty much anything and especially not for any sort of legal standing she might have for a discrimination lawsuit. What could she have possibly said on social media that would have such a negative effect? Unless you did or said something you are not disclosing you can easily rebut her by explaining that, as an employer, when she said she was unable to do her job because of an illness you told her to take the rest of the day, you could also state that you are happy to make long term accomodations when she brings in disability paperwork.

On a side note for self and non professional diagnosis- it isn't just annoying, it is reckless and can be harmful. What many people in my circle told me was simple anxiety turned out to be a fairly convoluted mess of Borderline Personality Disorder and PTSD. Anxiety also presents with similar symptoms as many disorders including ASD. It is also an abused term by some people who don't want to do something or are uncomfortable to get out of things, which makes it difficult to determine who to take seriously and who is full of it. 

It sounds like people like your employee are why documentation is necessary and trust is non-existent."

AmItheAsshole,fk98pq3,t1_fk8ydos,1583971019.0,"I don't really have an issue with the phone tracking if both parties agree with it. I have several friends who share with their parents or friends so that if something happens, they are findable. I share my location with my mother almost always because I have a medical condition so if she doesn't hear from me/I'm not where I said I would be in a reasonable time/I'm not answering she can try to get me help if needed. This was especially useful when I was driving long trips weekly. Point being, it is useful for more than tracking your teens.

But the mother requiring it is overbearing. And then it not being enough is just insane."

He's even running pretty normal running hours for people who are busy. You aren't trying to keep him safe you are trying to exert control over your son who is breaking away and doing a damn good job at growing up by your account.

YTA.

You realistically have 2 choices - 1. Hold to a harsh ""my house, my rules"" and see how fast he gets the hell out of your house. Or 2. Have reasonable boundaries that don't tell a legal adult what they can and can't do with their time."

Originally, your boyfriend did sound like he was being controlling. But he also sounded concerned and I think that nuance was lost. I'm very glad you brought it to the front and made sure he was supported here, even if he never reads it. Sounds like you are doing everything you can to cope and not let it become a new problem.

More often than not, especially that early on, it isn't worth it. My husband and I are dealing with broken trust and have gone into couples therapy. I consider worth the effort to try for my 3 year relationship. You have to decide if the good outweighs the bad.

If you decide to try, insist on meeting baby mama to make sure they are exes and you are not the side chick."
relationships,fjivdvj,t3_fdjm92,1583376617.0,"A fight isn't a reason to cheat. It may be a reason to leave, but never a reason to cheat. He let you take blame that was his with that lie.

The end result may be the same, but the lie changes the scenario. You were betrayed and still lied to for 2 years. Your husband is wrong and your feelings are valid.

If you are planning to stay, couples therapy seems to be necessary. He should probably do some on his own as well to figure out why the extramarital affair and the lies to you about the facts once it came to light.

Tbh, while it is ultimately good that you know the truth, that side chick seems extra shady. She didn't tell because she felt guilty, she told because he left her. Then she's gotta check in and make sure things are still fucked and stir the pot.

I'm so sorry you have having to deal with this. Wish you the best."

relationships,fj2hpd0,t1_fj2gify,1582943951.0,"Best I can figure right now is one of the things we've been working on in therapy is he developed a habit young to lie in order to protect himself so he lied to me a lot for a while, even in situations where there was no reason to think I'd be mad (trauma responses don't logic). He may have thought I'd be upset that he'd been engaged idk. But when we were talking yesterday he told me the story of how he got down on knee, with the ring he bought, on a street corner and she said yes and they celebrated etc. The engagement was real and he really lied. I don't think he did it to be malicious, but actions don't have to be malicious to hurt someone.

A petty part of me is upset because he said he was going to propose to me and then months later ""I just decided not to"" and I justified that with he'd never proposed to anyone so it isn't his thing. But he has and now I feel like maybe I'm just not worth the effort. I know that part is petty and overreacting, and I'm trying to manage that part. 

And being upset about who specifically is partially petty and partially me being tired of hearing about this specific ex who he insisted I had to meet this ex of his who is a great friend and then he lied to me about almost every aspect of their relationship. But, she is actually quite cool, she makes mead.

But mostly I'm upset that he thought it was cool that neither of us had been engaged so it was new for both of us and then all of a sudden a year and half later he has an engagement story. That is where I'm unsure if im being petty or if my feelings of being hurt are valid."

relationships,fj2eth6,t1_fj2egkc,1582941848.0,"Really my issue with you here is you've decided I'm upset he has an ex. I have them too, literally don't care about that.

You aren't listening, just bragging about yourself. You're super chill about about your partners exes, but it seems like he's been pretty honest about it. How would you feel if he told you he's never been married then all of a sudden an ex is am ex wife? It isn't the ex that is the issue, it's the lie.

Again, you think I'm overreacting, fine, that's literally the question I asked. But instead of answering it you've bragged about yourself and been rude. Why you even here? You want a medal because you can get along with someone's ex? I already said she is lovely, so anyone with reading comprehension could figure that I've hung out with her."

relationships,fj2dt0y,t1_fj2dd77,1582941106.0,"I'm assuming if they came over for dinner he told you they existed when you talked about exes than. 

I have no issue with his ex, she's actually lovely, I have an issue that he told me he'd never been engaged before but now all of a sudden he has been. To the same girl that he told me he told me he'd never lived with, but had, said he'd been broken up with for a year and a half when we got together, but it had only been a couple of months.

Maybe before being rude, read the whole post. Still totally fine if you think I shouldn't be upset with him but ""grow up"" is judgemental bullshit and unnecessary.

Edit to say: he also lied about talking to her when I hadn't expressed any problem, nor actually had any problem, with him talking to her."
relationships,fj28j8a,t1_fj2867l,1582937234.0,"I get your point, and you're right, there are definitely things I thought that were worked out that aren't. 

We aren't legally married because of me, I felt it was more important to pay down debt than to save for a wedding, and he agreed. He has shown his commitment in other ways. I got quite sick and had to move back to my hometown and gave him the option to try long distance or break up because he really liked where he was and his response was ""being with you is more important"" and the city boy moved to a small town for the last year and a half, one year of he was completely supporting us financially because I was to sick to work.

He tried to qualify the previous proposal by saying he felt like he had to, got scared and proposed on a street corner on the way to the place instead of doing the plan. I'm still upset because planned or not, panicked or not, she got that moment and I didn't. I put the argument on pause because nothing he can say right now will help and I don't want to hear it.
