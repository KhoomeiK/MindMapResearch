Dreams,f8dkt8x,t3_e0a27l,1574495762.0,"Repetitive settings that are always a conglomerate of places I’ve seen or been to. It’ll dawn on me that I’m familiar with the layouts of the room/building I’m in, but notice that an integral structure of the original is missing or that another place has been stitched on seamlessly. Or that the architecture of the place doesn’t seem sound/make sense and it’ll bug me into realizing I’m dreaming.

That, and the POV of my dream will shift drastically the way a camera would when filming a movie to gain the best aesthetic perspective. For instance, dream!me will drive somewhere and suddenly it goes from first person to bird’s eye."

JUSTNOMIL,f8a3fdw,t1_f84n8hd,1574386696.0,"SO and I are on the same page about his mother, and this is a years-long reoccurring issue for him. FMIL has never respected his wishes to not ruin his current relationship by bringing up his past ones. I’m not the outlier here, but I most certainly Am Not The One to cross unlike the others who simply accepted her actions as being “it is what it is”."
JUSTNOMIL,f8a2yh7,t1_f85dqh8,1574386333.0,"Thank you for the solid advice, my dude. FMIL has always had things her meddling way or it’s been made hell otherwise; boundaries might as well mean you’re spitting in her face and calling her famous lasagne trash. SO and I have started formulating our united front game plan for the holiday season, and I’ happy to say that he’s on board with revoking her access to us both if that’s what it takes for the message that our relationship needs to be respected to stick."
JUSTNOMIL,f8a29ig,t1_f840exx,1574385807.0,"THANK YOU!!! That’s what I said and she just pursed her lips at me, huffed, and went about her business instead of sucking it up and admitting that her golden potential fave was actually fool’s gold all along."
Skincare_Addiction,f8a11jg,t3_dzr1br,1574384868.0,"Look into Bioderma! It’s the OG micellar water cleanser on the market and is great for use on sensitive, delicate skin such as the eye area. It’s totally affordable, easily obtainable, and a bottle will last you a good while. My skin loves it."
SuicideWatch,f87e4w4,t3_dyc4yh,1574328641.0,"This is me, currently. The overwhelming, soul-crushing feeling of existential dread and years of internalized suffering resurfacing amidst an unbelievably shitty point in my life is giving me chest pain right now. I’ve been crying off and on for the last couple of hours, and I just want it all to stop and to finally know peace.

I have a folding hunting knife my uncle gave me years ago. I’m almost never without a pocket knife for safety reasons. 

Two nights ago was the first time I’ve ever truly self-harmed. I would always get scared and back out at the last minute. I’m terrified of how much I want to do it again. 

I hate physical pain—especially self-inflicted, but it was... cathartic to finally have the hurt I feel internally reflected externally and to see physical evidence that I was/am/are hurt(ing). 

To have what I feel validated by blood when I have tried so many other outlets to be seen and heard and recognized is such a morbid fucking joke to me.

It would be so easy to simply end it all, and there is literally nothing stopping me.

Both my partner and his dog are right next to me, oblivious in their sleep. It’s raining outside, and a train is passing by. The apartment complex we live in is quiet; everybody but me seems to be asleep. It’s a week night.

My soul is exhausted. I’m so tired of enduring what seems to be a never-ending storm. Nights like these make me reconsider what’s preventing me from finding the calm—from just fucking full on yeeting myself out of existence and into the abyss. I’m so over being alive. I’m literally not even having a good time so what the fuck is the point?"

JUSTNOMIL,f83vs6g,t3_dyvvg1,1574222316.0,"That sounds like the most ideal way to spend the holiday, imo. No pandering to egos and no feelings of discomfort, just magical moments with good food and wine. I’m happy for you!"
JUSTNOMIL,f83v93n,t1_f83slfv,1574221889.0,"The pettier part of me has thought of this, and I did bring up my ex’s brother inviting me to his college graduation this past May to FMIL in passing after the fact/before our relationship became so chaotic... she was frigid and said something along lines of “well, some relationships you just gotta cut ties with”. I wonder how’d she react now if I were to bring up his parents 🤔"
JUSTNOMIL,f83uqiw,t1_f83n3jq,1574221479.0,"I did early on as it made me feel guilty for knowing these things without SO being the one to share it with me considering it’s HIS actual past relationship to speak on, yes! 

I’d asked her to please not do so and explained as kindly as I could that it made me feel lesser than/like I was simply a replacement for EX and felt that we weren’t forming a true bond because of it. FMIL waved it all off as me being too sensitive until SO found me sobbing in bed over how badly she’d made me feel.

She apologized via text the morning after he had a long talk with her about it saying how she was “sorry and didn’t mean to hurt my feelings” and “not to worry, it won’t happen again”, ignored me for a nearly a week afterwards, and would stop herself from bringing up EX for the rest of that month. She went right back to her bullshit once  the next month started though and that was when I chose to withdraw.

Thank you for the advice and I’ll certainly remember it next time she tries to guilt me into spending time with her! I really appreciate it 🥰"
