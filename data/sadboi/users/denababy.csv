I haven’t been temping or using ovulation tests because I feel like it’s probably not the best time to get too nuts about it. Too much down time to think about it and speculate every tiny twinge and symptom. Plus our current living situation isn’t ideal for nesting and preparing, if I’m being realistic. 

I used Depo for years. I switched to the mini-pill for 9 months and then went off that in September ‘19. My doctor thought it would be the best to allow my body to transition. So I always assume that maybe my body is still coming around to things.

My PMS is always tender breasts, tension headaches, nausea, and lethargy particularly in the couple days before my period shows up.

I think you need to genuinely question if you’re happy with your partner, if you have romantic feelings for them, what makes them a good person to be in a relationship with, etc. Maybe try writing out the answers - to get really clear with yourself.
