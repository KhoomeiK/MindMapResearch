Now I can't even remotely connect or talk with a dude (some sort of a knee-jerk PTSD reaction), but I want EVERY girl I know to want to have sex with me, even though (and also because) they're the only human connection I have.

You'll find the major to be pretty much individualistic till you get to third year, everyone just doing their own thing with zero group projects. With co-ops getting you that valuable money and experience, people rarely get involved in projects and startups as there is no academic need to do so, and CS doesn't leave you a lot of spare time to do stuff outside academics.

There's no need to feel pressured to sign quickly even if you're sitting in KW4RENT's manager's office. I asked for some time to read it and he gave me the room for 20 minutes. If you don't read what you sign then you're entirely to blame, and should probably be accompanied by a real adult next time.

As far as the 3 year contract goes, it has its own benefits. I locked down one of their penthouses at a dirt cheap rate and I fully intend to stay for 3 years. Having a lease allows you to have direct communication with the landlord, and the landlord is answerable to you to some extent, something which is not possible in a sublet. You have a clear say in household matters like cleanliness and hydro. 

Like someone said here, maybe they do this because switching to a monthly rental system will turn their student accommodations into literal guest houses with people moving in/out literally all the time. Plus most students are in town anyways for 8 months (other than those with 8 month co-ops out of town, but that's a low percentage), and the average length of a regular program without breaks is around 3 years at most. So having a longer lease made sense for them I guess, just my 2 cents not a rep."

BorderlinePDisorder,fn5zuqr,t3_fzp3ua,1586681939.0,"I think the biggest thing that us BPD folks worry about is relationships with other people when we don't have good relationship with ourselves. I'm 21 and I only realized this last week having struggled for so long. I promise you that the journey is a long and tough one but you're always gonna have a companion which is you! You have to set an example about how you want to be treated by treating yourself with kindness and forgiveness first. It's okay! What you're feeling is completely normal and rational! There's a reason BPD is acquired and not genetic, because it wasn't your fault how you were treated. Please don't hate your life, it's YOUR life, and its all you got! Wear your BPD proudly like a badge of all the struggles and pain you endured, and know that you're probably the strongest king/queen/monarch amongst all the people around you. You have nothing to prove to anyone but yourself.

That being said I understand the crucial importance of having people in your life, because the loneliness sucks harder for us. It's especially worse in the current situation with the quarantine. I assure you that the world is such a big place, now connected more than ever with Internet, that definitely there are people who'll fucking love to have you as a friend! In absence of any other mental health supports, it really helps to be a part of an online support group. I recently joined a discord server for Guys with BPD cuz there's not enough guys with BPD around and although we empathize and we care, we can't entirely relate with most stuff posted by women on this forum or any other. It really feels nice to be able to talk about literally anything with kind, empathetic dudes who also listen, understand and relate to my feelings, and don't just outright call me a p*ssy cuz I have ""the emotional range of a woman"" (I know, toxic males suck, but we don't ðŸ™‚). If this is something you or anyone else reading this would be interested in, shoot me a PM I'll add you! We welcome everybody, not just guys! If not, I strongly suggest you find a support group that suits your needs, I can assure you that you'll not be treated like the world treated you. You'll be treated with the dignity and respect you deserve!"

apexlegends,fmvnq2l,t1_fmvgync,1586423830.0,"Bruh Iâ€™ve been a former quality assurance analyst for a major software firm, basically responsible for the testing you mention. From my experiences, and those of my counterparts in other companies, a common problem that has stood out is that at any moment, either the QA analysts are slacking and marking all tests as passed without even testing (testing can be a very repetitive, annoying, and mundane job if not tackled with the right attitude), or they are being pressed on hard by the Devs to approve the latest patches at the 11th hour, again leaving them no choice but to either let it pass or hold up the entire delivery. Choosing to use the QA departmentâ€™s power to hold up a patch delivery usually gets overridden by senior execs as the Devs in any company are the rockstars and shouldnâ€™t be trifled with in the first place. Basically if you constantly see buggy releases from a developer, there are high chances that either they donâ€™t have a dedicated testing department and the devs do limited testing, or if they do have a QA department, they donâ€™t have respect for it."
