On to why I think you're setting yourself up for some bad shit and why you kinda suck as person. You gave your accountant blow jobs in the past. You're now fooling around with his son. 1) Do you realize the kind of power your accountant has over you? He has your finances in his hands. He has material to blackmail you with. Get a new accountant.

Do you think that sounds crazy and unrealistic? Well, it's not, because of 2) You gave your accountant head several times and are now in a sexual relationship with *his son*, who has no idea about your interlude with his father. I'm tempted to call this fake, because this literally sounds so unbelievable to me.

When my wife was getting into the swing of learning who she really is, she found the trans community on Twitter. I joined for awhile, but kinda phased out as time went on (social anxiety and stuff makes interacting with people continuously exhausting, also I hate Twitter in general). There are people who absolutely use cis as a slur, *but* it's the same way people use trans as a slur. Cis and trans are not inherently slurs, but they can be used in that way. They use it to create a divide and to convey that one is better than the other, and can cause someone to feel alienated.

My wife is mtf trans, and she has PTSD from an abusive childhood. Touch that came from behind was a trigger, sometimes touching her shoulder while in front of her could do it.

Before she came out as trans and was effectively a man to the world, she had a similar issue. She would tell people that she had PTSD and touch can trigger it. Men seemed to ignore this bit of info the most. Slaps on the back, grabbing her shoulder, and so on were common enough, that even four years later after her coming out I still remember her telling me about the triggering events and breaking down in the car or bathroom.

I just wanted to add to your comment about how common this kind of behavior is among men.

What's sad is that female doctors are just as guilty as their male counterparts, but if gynecology had more women perhaps real, effective changes could be brought about more quickly.

My own story is that I was told my irregular periods were normal and ""I could still have lots of kids"". It took 5 years before a doctor said, ""No that's not okay or normal, and if you're not shedding your lining, there is an increased chance cancerous cells can form."" That's a big deal! Holy shit!

I was great at farming and hunting, though!  And I kept things organized.

WoW was next. Super overwhelming! There is just *so much*. Plus, my wife went full speed ahead when we played (she already played through everything), so I missed a lot in trying to keep up with her. I played for a bit, but just couldn't get into it. Even when we played at my speed.

My wife introduced me to more ""modern"" gaming. I mean I played Mario Bros., Donkey Kong, and similar games growing up, but the first game she introduced me to was Dragon Age: Origins when it had first released. I fell in love with RPGs, because of DA (I'm impatiently waiting for DA 4).

Everyone is jumping her case like it's somehow her fault that her grown ass adult roommate doesn't abide quarantine rules. All she can do is explain why and tell him he needs to stay home.

What else do you want her to do? What else CAN she do?  Yeah, he's an asshole, but it's not her fault."
AmItheAsshole,fnx8oq5,t3_g49inc,1587333682.0,"I'm so proud of you and your daughter! You realized you needed to work on things, too, and made the effort (and succeeded!) to be more balanced, you've stuck by your daughter and have been there for her, you encourage her, and you've been such a great mom. I'm also glad your daughter has been making such positive changes to her life! I know how hard it is, and I'm just really proud of her.

You both have worked hard and you're setting up a good foundation to keep it going. I wish you both the best and hope you continue finding the strength to stick to your goals. <3"
