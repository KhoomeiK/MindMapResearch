Chaotic Good - ***The Queen of Men***

My name is *Violet, no family, no family name.* I've lived my entire *29 years* as a soldier among men. I have seen the horrors of war and how terrible it can be, raiding turns into the unthinkable as we pretend like innocent villagers are our enemies. I always hated it, to see the disgusting act of taking out frustrations on poor farmers. 

I've fought for so long among these pigs that they considered me one of their bests. Being a great fighter wielding my axe I've also made a loyal friend; James. James has alike mindset where he does not believe in the raiding of our food sources. One day I was witnessing a girl being dragged by the hair, she was a beautiful red headed maiden with here eyes red and green from the suffering shes going through. I could not bare it- I had to intervene, I stopped the pig on his tracks and tried to save the poor girl. The pig turned to a rabid dog, acting as if I have taken his meal away from him. The man dared put a hand on me, and as soon as I felt it I chopped it off. I refuse to let his disgusting hands on me unpunished. 

As I cut down the slimy pig James arrives: ""Violet, what have you done?"" I look at him, and tell him to take the girl and grab two horses. He grabs the girl as the scene becomes more apparent to the men around us, a commotion ensues and the commander arrives. He looks at me atop his white armored stallion and exclaims: ""Explain yourself soldier!"" He stands in front of me and stares at me. I say, ""I will not stand for this atrocity any longer."" Commander Helvar fashions a falcon with a curved tip, almost like a hook. He wields his sword and yells: ""Traitor!""

In a moments notice I am fighting Helvar, neither were able to connect a good hit until he disarms me using his hooked sword. I have never been disarmed in my entire life, I was scared, I thought my life would end. As I dodge his killing swings, he grows impatient and grabs  my armor closer to him, it was his mistake. I grab mt knife and slash him across the right eye, he lets me go and staggers in pain. ""Violet!"" I hear from behind me, I see James with two horses and the girl mounted behind him. I run towards the horse and jump. ""After them!"" yells Helvar. James and I were able to escape past the enemy borders.

I will never forget that day, it was the beginning towards my journey **to become Queen**. A Queen for the people that will protect the poor and make sure that warfare becomes history. With James at my side and the girl professing her loyalty, I know I can achieve a  peaceful country, with no war."

Bannerlord,fn7lkcg,t1_fn7kfl8,1586722752.0,"Well, active modders tend to update their mods to be compatible with the most possible, otherwise they keep an update list of mods that don't work alongside theirs.

to figure out compatibility, just make sure the mods you are downloading don't contradict each other, for example: Bannerlord teaks works with the files that correspond to player input, so you wouldn't want to pair it with a mod that does the same. 

The CITEditor IS a player input mod, so it would work just fine with Bannerlord tweaks because they don't contradict each other.

and example of a contradicting mod would be a mod that changes the classes for bandits, and if there's a mod where for example it changes just ONE of the classes, they contradict each other, so it wouldn't work well most likely.

(there's a couple more variables to this, I just tried to explain it assuming you don't code.)"

Now, I’m not saying to go out and sleep in a car, BUT what I am saying is that if you find your own place and just take it day by day, you might find yourself pleasantly surprised by the freedom you have.
