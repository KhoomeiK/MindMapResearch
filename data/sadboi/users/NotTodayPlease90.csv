ITCareerQuestions,fg6r5lb,t1_fg6kxk8,1580574981.0,"This.

My team have a shared one note, when new things come up, I add in a new page with the issue and steps to fix.

Whenever I get an issue I'm not sure about, I just search the one note and if it is on there I will find it straight away instead of trawling through separate documents etc.

After a while of doing this you will have a decent amount of info all in one place and will be helpful for other team members as well as new people than join in the future."

Psychosis,f6w6t35,t1_f6vzxb1,1573218389.0,It might go away but it is best to get help. I'm glad you have made the decision to go back to the doctor. Why do you not want to take Xanax?
Psychosis,f6vzcnm,t3_dtdc97,1573209099.0,"Please don't wait until it is too late. If you try to hurt yourself it could be too late, go get help now, tell the doctors how you really feel and do what they advise and take what they prescribe. It's okay to not be okay, but getting help is what you need. I hope you make the right decision."

Vaping,f24kjp1,t1_f24j5gk,1569954402.0,"I think that I may have been leaving the cotton a little too long on some of my tries. Also saw one video that advised these type of decks need to use the ""dam method"" so it is only just in the wick holes to avoid clogging up the flow of juice.

Thanks for your input on this, much appreciated!"

Loving the extra power and the taste from the Zeus is great, I've had a lot of fun (!) trying to get the wicking correct. Think I should have maybe started with a single coil rta.

Any advice for consistently good wicks? Watched loads of YouTube videos etc but it looks like it's going to be a trial and error. 

Been between too much cotton resulting in dry hits and flooding the tank with too little. Seems to be a difficult thing to get right!"

My other half has experienced mental illness, her employer was nothing but supportive, and she has even secured anoteher job in less than a year of her psychotic episode, and was completely upfront about her issues with occupational health at the new place. This is the UK by the way. This is anecdotal though so I guess it depends on the employer."

I took a long break from running and started to lose my way in life, started back up and I'm feeling good again. My advice: don't stop! But for God sake don't overdo it as injury is a bitch."
