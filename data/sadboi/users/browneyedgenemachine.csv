The good news is that the environment ive created for my boys is just full of love and openness and in doing that I like to pretend that I'm retroactively healing my younger self.  I just wish I could go back in time and hug/long embrace myself at different times.....age 11, 17, 19, 24, even 30 when I almost ended it all...and tell that younger version of myself that I wasn't actually a fraud and actually wasn't a waste of a human being.
