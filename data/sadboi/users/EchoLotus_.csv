We never really got along that much back then and that day she kept pushing my buttons by kicking or punching me every once in a while for stupid reasons. I got really fed up with her and just kind of snapped at this party we were at and went at it. Didn’t hurt her at all but I still feel really bad about how I reacted and how we used to treat each other back then. This was maybe 3 years ago and now we are best friends. We hang out all the time and talk about everything. She even got me the job I have now and trained me. I truly enjoy it. I would take a bullet for her seriously. Things couldn’t be better. But we never really talk about how we used to be towards each other but it’s been brought up once or twice and I still feel remorseful.


Or when I was 8 and my mom wanted to surprise me by bringing me to this pho restaurant I’ve never been to. I asked her where we were going and I was kind of pissed because I didn’t want to go anywhere but she didn’t tell me where we were going and that it was a surprise. Got to the pho place and I was being a rotten and ungrateful little child and kept complaining how I didn’t like the food and wanted to go home. My mom got really embarrassed and ignored me the whole time so just went on her phone. I still feel really bad 10 years later. I went to that restaurant for the first time again last year and I actually really love pho and eat it at least once every week or 2."
