CPTSD,fqhd1lq,t3_giglz9,1589374335.0,"First, I want you to know that I hear you, we hear you, and we understand. We have been there. I have been there. I have experienced so many of the same things you have. It is painful, and hard, and frustrating, and completely unfair to have been brought into a world with parents that are incapable of raising us the way innocent children deserve to be raised. I want you to know that I am writing this with all the love and care in my heart. I am extending to you all the empathy I have to give. I know. I know what it's like to have to face the day battling depression and anxiety, the physical and mental symptoms that make ""small"" things seem like Mount Everest. 

Second, I want you to know that there are options and there are ways to slowly (slowly) get better. It is not easy. Every step I take towards a healthier life, I feel pain and learn new ways that I just wasn't cared for properly. I am working through it because I don't want to live like this. I don't want anxiety attacks over going to the store, or saying hi to a neighbor. So when you are able to, you can search for more help and treatment. 

Finally, I just want to repeat how much I understand. I just understand. You can message me if you want to talk more."

CPTSD,fojebm9,t1_foj46qh,1587818402.0,"Not OP- Basically like, if your mom/caregiver didn't show emotion or care to you as a child, you wouldn't develop those responses because how could you spontaneously develop something you didn't learn?

How these people had us and thought it was a good idea... well no, I'm applying rational thought to their narcissistic behavior and desperate need for constant affection, attention, and codependency. It sucks to have parents who could never be healthy parents. It sucks growing up having your entire existence invalidated, and feeling like a burden, and basically not having any self-esteem. And then becoming an adult and having to reparent yourself.
