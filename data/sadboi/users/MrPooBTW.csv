EscapefromTarkov,f7e0qig,t1_f7dxdrh,1573640510.0,"no, I never liked it when they were dumb i'm level 32 currently, my problem is that they literally see me through things from over 200 meters away. I play a lot of woods and i like to stay in the trees, so having them be able to see me through those trees is what I don't like."
