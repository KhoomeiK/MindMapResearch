RedDeadOnline,f0w0ff2,t1_f0vyyep,1568996126.0,Glad it helped. You'll start to notice the change in sound when a gun is clean as opposed to dirty. I can usually tell from that. I didn't buy split points till maybe lvl 150 (just to have all the ammo types) but I wish I'd known earlier.

1-3. I craft as much as possible, not only to save money but for immersion. I haven't got all the pamphlets, just the ones I find useful + ones from treasure chests. I don't want to pay 2.50 every time for a horse reviver for instance, and I pick herbs enough to just craft them as and when I need them. It took a bit of an initial grind but once you're up to 10 of them, it's easy enough to maintain. Crafting just makes me feel like I've earned what I have and stops me using things when I don't need to. Like someone said above, once you're a high enough level you don't really need tonics.

The only consumable i regularly buy is gun oil, everything else is easily looted on the go. 

4-5. I eat all meat types.  Again once you're in a rhythm of doing it you rarely need to go out your way to find more. I feed both my horse and myself when either of us gets below half core. The time spent seems like nothing compared to what I could be spending on it. 

6. Normal for NPCS, Express for players and Explosive for greifers. Explosive is easy to maintain if you're only using it for this purpose. Get yourself some split point for now for the xp.

7. Soon as the first bar goes I would recommend cleaning as it is a noticeable change in performance. 

8. Loot everything. Hunt on the go. Variety is the spice of life, don't get stuck on doing one thing over and over. Familiarise yourself with the map as best you can, it's very useful to know where cliff faces are for instance. I'd also recommend learning animal values. 

Hope this helps"
