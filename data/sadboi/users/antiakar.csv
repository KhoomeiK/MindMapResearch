BPD4BPD,fkwa0p0,t1_fkw7jtr,1584587003.0,"I feel like this all the time and I know it’s my bpd and really strong anxiety and depression. I have pushed so many people away because I’m ashamed of the way I feel and always feel this unbearable pain that makes me lash out or retreat away. I’ve tried moving and getting a new environment and it all comes back to the shit I feel in my own head all the time. I can’t escape my head and people have really hurt me with their words and have no compassion or empathy and have called me evil, an emotionless brick wall and a devil. This is a lot for a person to feel."
BPD4BPD,fkw2f7y,t1_fkvsoa8,1584581928.0,Have you changed? And how have you?
BPD4BPD,fkv5xja,t3_fkv989,1584562743.0,"In my experience, telling people just freaked them out and was never helpful. Believe me I totally understand what you feel and the pain you are in and wanting someone to understand and help. Unfortunately, people don’t see the world as we do and the feeling of being misunderstood pushes people away."
BPD,fkv3txj,t3_fkqq28,1584561453.0,Yes please I feel lonely
BPD4BPD,fkv2x8n,t1_fkuw9j0,1584560933.0,I don’t know what to do anymore
BPD,fkmr7ua,t3_fi29og,1584337102.0,I can relate to this and seeing others flourishing and doing well sends me into deep depression
BPD,fk6op3o,t3_fgsfns,1583909489.0,I feel this way all the time. People in my life say if you wanted to commit suicide you would have done it by now. They think I’m just seeking attention

BPD,fjzqhna,t3_ffnlkt,1583726338.0,I know the rage you are talking about and have unsupportive people around me that tell me to snap out of it. It only makes me more angry
BPD,fjysy41,t3_ffeg9q,1583703914.0,I’m looking for a friend :)
BPD,fjyqa1l,t3_ffiiy9,1583702269.0,"Your post really resonated with my feelings. So it’s safe to say, you aren’t alone. It is crazy to think that someone understands what I am feeling. I daily have moments where I think I am the only one who feels this way and want to leave this world or hurt myself.

I HATE people so much because they are happy and flourishing in their lives. Im so envious of them and have no idea why I am the way I am. I only have one friend who I hate because she is so successful, happy and has an amazing relationship and job. Everyone else I once knew is flourishing in ways I never ever will. It especially hits me when it is family with stable jobs and families. I just think it’s really unfair and cruel to have BPD. I’m jealous of everyone, even of strangers on the bus who seem like they are happy. 

I’m also lonely, hate myself, have no source of income , am unable to go out in social situations, and  really really miserable. I haven’t even qualified for social assistance because I need my parents income which they refuse to give me. They still think I’m “normal”. I hate them soo much. I use redit as a way to minimize my loneliness but nothing really helps."
mentalillness,fjm3kt8,t1_fjk4ox0,1583460812.0,"Again, I think it’s important to remember that you aren’t alone in this. I tend to forget this part all the time. It sounds that the job is really meaningful to you and I’m happy you have that going for you. I’d love to chat more in messages if you would like. I’m looking for people who truly understand."
mentalillness,fjk09su,t1_fjjt8cl,1583417042.0,"Agreed. Also, people generally have a deeper understanding, acceptance and sympathy for cancer. I can understand that any disease or illness takes a toll on the individual and the family. But, BPD is known to be destructive to the family as a unit especially when the family has no understanding or doesn’t believe in mental illness. In fact, part of the cause is suggested to be the invalidation we received as children. Whatever the case, it is definitely A HUGE STRUGGLE everyday. Even though, I also recognize the struggle it puts on people around me, I still believe only someone who is going through it truly understands. Still then, every case is very very different. Unfortunately, my immediate family is very unsupportive.  My parents think I’m overreacting and one family member in my life just tells me « it’s unfortunate and that that she needs to live her life ». She also continually reminds me that  « it is definitely, something I’ll struggle with forever and it’s up to you to be happy». Like, don’t you think I know that by now? And if being happy was that easy; wouldn’t I have done it? It sucks seeing how close they are with their family and how healthy and self- loving they are. I feel like even my psychiatrist has given up on me. I haven’t worked in over 8 months and have no idea how I’m going to continue to live financially. I’m also someone who eats my feelings away, so I’ve been eating out all the time. But it was very encouraging to see that you have a job. I hope to accomplish that someday."

mentalillness,fjj3hac,t1_fjh7fiv,1583382326.0,"I agree whole heartedly. Also, having cancer may have allowed me to fight for my life rather than fight the urge to kill myself. But I can’t imagine battling cancer , my major depression and my bpd."
BPD4BPD,fjj30c6,t3_fdnn2q,1583381964.0,"Remember this will pass. I know you are going through a rough time but the feelings aren’t constant and there is a future ahead. Try distracting yourself with things like a game on your phone, eating something you like or just going outside"
