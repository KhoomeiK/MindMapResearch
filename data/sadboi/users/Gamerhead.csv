dating_advice,fp7favv,t1_fp6t3bf,1588369548.0,"If you're like me, we were always 'us' in the relationship. I asked her to be upfront with who she was when we first met and she agreed. Little did I know that she was just in love with what I could give her, not loving me like I wanted to be loved or the way I loved her. 

This isn't necessarily her fault, she didn't really come from a great home. She was abused and such, so I was there to try and take care of her. It worked for about 16 months. After that, she showed her true colors. I had gotten her a job, helped her succeed in school, her life was on the up and up. I was super happy because I was helping her be the best her she could be. 

But like I said, she got those things and showed me her true self. She was lazy, self destructive, and somehow always made me feel like things were my fault or that my opinion was wrong. Another year and a half or so, I tried to leave her because she wasn't putting anything into it anymore. She pleaded with me that she could change, bawled. So I let her try. A few months later, she leaves me, when I actually needed her help for once. 

It really stings, but I fell in love with who I wanted her to be. That was my mistake. But then again, she was gorgeous and willing to give ME a chance. I wanted a promised and bright future for us, but I just felt used when her life was sustainable without me so she left.

Something I've been working on myself is to stop comparing progress between her and I. When we met last week, we fucked like rabbits from 5pm to 5am. The next morning, I realized that she still was this changed uncaring person who lies about her feelings. I wanted the old love back, but she's said it's changed too much. I knew that and was willing to work on it, but that's the difference between her and I. I was willing to put in the effort.

But yeah, it hurt me when she told me she had already slept with someone else after we broke up. I felt that she had already moved past me and I was just lonely as ever while people lust after her. I try to keep this thought away, but it makes me feel worse. However, I guess that's who she is; I'm not. I'm not one to sleep around, I only sleep with people I love, or at least I think. But to turn around that quick after three years broke my heart and whatever feelings I had left for the current version of her.

I'm still on track to do something great with my life, and if she doesn't want it, she can honestly wallow in her own self pity for the rest of her life. I don't care anymore."
dating_advice,fp4veic,t1_fp4kee0,1588308395.0,I know we will dude. They really aren't worth our salt. What we give should be reciprocated and appreciated. The only way my ex showed me 'appreciation' was by opening her legs. It was definitely a learning experience and I'll do better next time. We both will.
dating_advice,fp3q04q,t3_gaznrs,1588283708.0,"Holy crap. This is honest to God my situation, except I'm the guy and my relationship was three years long. I fell very very hard and we clinged to each other like someone was gonna try to take one of us away. I'd never been in a relationship before, so she showed me everything, filled my head with promises of marriage and kids and a future I never thought I would have. I've always wanted to be a family man, so I was finally happy.

On Valentine's day this year, she said she'd fallen out of love with me. After everything I've given her, supported her for years, emotionally, financially, whatever. Looking back I can see how she used me and manipulated me. All I wanted was love, but she was done getting what she needed out of me.

I agree with u/Stefskarma. Try your damndest to act like they don't exist... for now. My ex came back last week after 2 months no contact, bawling that she had made a mistake and that I was perfect, that she had never realized how much I meant to her. Now this was music to my ears, and I kissed her. I fucked her. I thought I had her back...

Two days later, she says she has to tell me something. A couple weeks after we broke up, she went and fucked someone else. She said she stopped it and regretted it ever since. Me being me, told her it was ok and I'll get over it, though it did hurt me. Over the next few days, she became more and more distant. Finally I ask her what the hell? She says she still isn't sure about 'us'. I'm sorry, I thought she came back to ME. Here I am, putting my heart on the line again for someone who's destroyed it before. I tell her fuck that, don't talk to me again. 

Now I'm here and lonely again. No friends, no love interests, nothing casual, nothing. It even stings more knowing she was a very pretty girl and I know she's out fucking around while I can't even get anyone to talk to me. However...

I've been through these dark times before, I've attempted suicide years ago but those days left me. I was still depressed, but my ex brought me out of that funk and I felt nothing but happiness for a few years. I will always be thankful for that from her, showing me that there is a light at the end of the tunnels we go through in life.

These are the times that define us. We fall so we can learn to pick ourselves up. I'm incredibly depressed right now, and sometimes I have bad thoughts again. But, if we can get through this during this time in the world, nothing can beat us down like this ever again."
dating_advice,fp32dgs,t1_fp2vh04,1588271907.0,"I hear you. I really put her above myself because I thought that's what love was. It wasn't always bad, but she definitely had a turning point and started loving me less. I'm not sure why, I was always the same person she fell in love with, though I did some changing for the better. I just thought if I gave her my all that she'd appreciate it. But then things happened like I lost my job and my car broke... She says that isn't why she left, but now I'm pretty sure she's sleeping around with people who are better off than some broke college boy. 

I've been trying to better myself, but it's hard to feel good about myself. I run, exercise, do archery, but I have no more confidence in the way I look. She was the only one that made me feel that I looked good. I dunno. I guess cause it's because I had 'proof' someone found me attractive. But those are far and in between, and right now people I talk to block me when I show them what I look like. I'm insecure and I've been trying to work on that, but damn it is hard right now."
