Mario/Rabbids was great fun single player, and it was a game my family watched each other play. Has a bit of a story and a multiplayer Vs mode is unlocked first 20 mins or so. 

Second diablo 3, I love it couch co op, my partner gave in an act or so in though and I don't think it's much fun single player IMO. I like how if one person is doing inventory stuff the other is locked out, so you might as well bathroom/make tea/answer a text

Just dance has multiplayer and will get you off the sofa (if that's your jam) 

Single player I'm loving Banner Saga ATM, there's two lead characters so you could take it in turns (and it's really fun to watch imo) 

And the single best game out atm is Obra Dinn, which is now on switch. Single player, but it's a story mystery so you can solve as a team, and it's just fantastic."

ShouldIbuythisgame,ffhp27b,t3_etkg21,1579946301.0,"It's good, not great. 

It's really buggy so you have to have mods, which always puts me off a game, the combat and levelling system is super unbalanced, so you have to purposely restrict yourself if you want to play as a mage, the controls are either- have all the hotkeys you need bit you'll be moving with wasd or have to pause the game mid fight constantly to get to use a controller, the inventory and money management sinks as much, if not more, time than the adventuring and compared to oblivion the quests aren't that creative. 

On the plus side, it'll be super cheap for the base game now so worth a try for the few that haven't played it, the overworld exploring is relaxing and still pretty for it's age and if you're the kind that doesn't need to pick up and go and have time to game there's a lot you can do to paper over the game's faults. I played PC controller with a few mods, legendary/survival mode (I'm not good at games, but the lack of fast travel and the difficulty makes the game feel better paced) and tell myself I won't pause mid battle, won't heal midbattle with cheeses (literally) and that setup was great for a 20-30 hour gameplay, which is about the amount of time I like to play to call a game good value."
