unpopularopinion,fiayasu,t3_f7f4lo,1582310818.0,Really it should show you something totally different? To me it shows that even hardened criminal’s have children on the outside. They can’t protect them where they are so they make sure they take the one that’s with them out. That’s one less molester he doesn’t have to worry about see even criminals have standards.

depression,fhgmmmx,t3_f2qwaw,1581571495.0,"We as a whole are so focused on the perception of others. I always worry about what I’m saying to someone because it’s not like I can rewind and start over.

depression,fh5m8kj,t3_f1djgl,1581290283.0,Where do you think the phrase wallowing in your own depression come from. Besides look at the world out there? It’s fucking falling apart why would I want to be a part of that. I would prefer isolation and depression then being around all those people.

depression,fgmsw70,t3_ezcd1s,1580931382.0,"I will not talk about a family member I lost to suicide because I don’t know you, I have been you! What I can tell you is if the pills that you took do not kill you. The feeling you’re going to get when you wake up and see your family faces will be far worse than the feeling that you were feeling when you took those pills. Your family will live in fear that you will do it again,The look on my sons face when I woke up in ICU was something I will never get out of my mind. Sad to say I hope you have to deal with that once.  Because it’s groundbreaking it’s at that point that you realize you indeed are loved.You have to realize that there are consequences to everything and when you’re depressed you think you’re doing other people a favor. I don’t know if other people think it but most times I feel like I’m a burden to my family and that’s what I felt like when I tried to kill myself I wish you luck and I wish you another chance.And if not I wish you peace."
depression,fg7ffbk,t3_ex7om6,1580591190.0,"I have been dealing with depression for 46 years and from my experience I would say you’re going through a deep depression. Those are the times when you can’t get out of bed. It just takes effort to take a shower.You avoid phone calls or contact with people,you constantly think about taking your life. It’s a bad place to be Because you have nobody to talk to and the ones you do have to talk to you just think you’re being dramatic but inside you’re just a mess.And for myself I’m always weak and tired doesn’t help going to the doctor they can’t give you anything it sucks!"
