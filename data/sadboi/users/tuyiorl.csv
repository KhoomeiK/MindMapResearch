abortion,fnil30d,t1_fniiioz,1586981863.0,"Hi! Stress really does affect periods a lot, I'm very regular so I waited a week before taking a pregnancy test because in the past I've had my period come late because of stress but when day number 7 came along and still nothing I took the test and it came back positive. I highly doubt you're pregnant, as most pregnancy tests can detect pregnancy before a missing period. And if you thought the light spotting you had was implantation bleeding then by now the test should have been positive and yet it wasn't. When was the last time you were with your partner? I   have a registry of all the times Ive had contact with my bf and all my fertile and infertile days, that's how I calculated day of conception (I screwed up and didn't realize my ovulation was just 5 days away last time I was with my bf and thats how I ended up pregnant) and that's how I also calculated how far along I was. 


Most of the time a test can come back negative if you take it too early, but I don't think that's the case here. I honestly believe you have nothing to worry about and it's just your stress messing with cycle. As for the pills, I didn't buy them online :( I'm not from USA so I reached out to a feminist organization in my country and they gave me the pills in exchange of donations. I went to the home of one of the women in charge and there they had the pills. They were very kind but they dont deliver outside of the country :c"

I wouldn't just blindly accept it and let the kid take a life changing choice like whatever, there's a reason a lot of young people are suddenly detransitioning. I would support my kid but I would fulfill my role as a parent by guiding them to the right choice.

My cousin is as beautiful as her mom, her mom isn't the best example as she cheated on my uncle with a richer older man. They are both stacys, and I hate them. 

My ex aunt was always so mean and angry when hanging out with my uncle, and now  she acts all in love with her new husband who she's only with because of the money. My cousin is no different, she takes selfies every day and I mean every single day. She dates guys waaaaay older than her, and she's so sexually open on her fb that it's almost embarrassing. Like what the hell? Why are you talking about how much sex you're having where your family can see what you're posting ?? And she's so picky with guys, like if the guy isn't tall or buff or whatever then she doesn't want him. And the problem is, no one cares! She's so beautiful that she can be picky because so many guys want her. 

She had a child with autism in the past, she was around 17. I thought that would make her stop being so shallow, and I was kinda happy when I found her baby's father cheated on her. Like finally something wasn't perfect in her life.... but now she's dating a guy who doesn't even know she has a child. My ex aunt decided to raise the baby as her own, despite my cousin living in the same house as her mom. The kid thinks my cousin is his sister, and the guy she's dating also thinks she's just the kid's older sister. My aunt helped her so she could find a richer older guy to support her, as my cousin hasn't even finished high school.

And no one cares!! She doesnt have a job or prospects for the future and it doesn't matter, she's so pretty she doesn't have to work. Everything's handed to her. She has her own ""company"" but it's all a scam. Her stepdad gives her money to buy cheap makeup in bulks and she resells it in quadruple the price, and the worst part? She's actually making so much money. Guys buy her stuff for their supposed gf's but I don't believe it for a second. They just want to see her.... and my whole family praises her, it's so frustrating. I'm happy my parents and siblings don't fall for it but everyone else does and it's so enfuriating."

I know guys are teased a lot when they derive from the norm and pursue relationships with girls who aren't supposed to be attractive. Even if they really are very cute despite their weight. 

Also it could be that only skinny girls were confident enough to date him, I remember I used to never make a move on a guy because I believed I wasn't good enough to be anyone's gf,  despite some guys heavily flirting with me. It usually ended in them getting frustrated and dating someone else. However I understand why you feel insecure in your relationship, but I think you shouldn't worry about it, guys can like all sorts of girls and maybe what makes you stand out from his other gfs isn't your body, but the connection you both have from knowing each other for so long, and that's why he choses to be with you and not somebody else."

Maybe try another hairstyle, but I really don't mind the one you have now. What's most important is to be confident and if you can be funny then even better. Women love guys who can make them laugh. (Just a tip, doesn't mean that you have to)"
stevenuniverse,fe1hpbj,t3_eni99l,1578826662.0,"I was and still am a big fan of Lars and Sadie, because I'm in a relationship that started just like theirs did. Funnily enough, I'm a short chubby girl  and my SO is a taller skinny guy. So I was really invested in their relationship (to add salt to the wound I also love to sing and I've been told to participate in the Voice, so I know I don't suck that much at it lol). I felt really connected to them, and to see how they suddenly split up broke my heart entirely. I'm happy that they are in good terms, but I felt just as uncomfortable as Steven did, and I postponed watching this episode a lot.

I've been finding myself doing that lately with SU Future quite a lot. I know he's grown up and changing but it feels like its just not the same anymore. I still love and support the show, but I'm having problems getting used to so many sudden changes."

ugly,fdvb00w,t3_en5u7h,1578745451.0,"I have a friend who used to think the same way about himself, I'm 1.54 m, he's also my height. He struggles with acne and he just got braces. I met him in college, he came from another state which was known for being very rural. City girls here are very awful so he struggled a lot with dating, and he even cried about it with me while we were taking the bus. I told him to stop trying so hard, to just take care of himsef and focus on getting his degree. 


He changed his wardrobe, he started doing a little bit of excercise, he started wearing boots with a slight heel to give him some more height, he got a more modern haircut and started going to local events he found interesting, where he could meet new people. I dont think he's the most handsome guy, but he stopped trying to seek for love everywhere and started paying more attention to himself, which really shows. His grades got better, he smiled way more often and wasn't so shy anymore. Today he has a lovely gf, his first real gf who hasn't made him cry and doesn't hide him from the world. They make a lovely couple and I'm happy for him :)


I think men who are on the shorter side do have it rough, and ugliness is something nobody wants although tbf beauty is in the eye of the beholder. We might think we are ugly when someone else could think of us as handsome/pretty or just ok. 
My best advice is stop worrying so much about it, focus on what makes you happy, on what you think you could do to improve yourself and stop wishing you could be someone else. And believe me, it will show, for the better."

relationship_advice,fbhq69j,t3_edd58e,1576879760.0,"I think a lot of people here are missing the point, like yeah it's her sister's life and she doesn't have a say in who the sister decided to involve with in a relationship BUT they're still family and she has every right to get mad at her for her stupid decisions. If my sister were to cheat on my BIL I would get mad at her, but I would be open to listen to my sister to get her side of the story and her reasoning behind it. Which seems what OPs sister hasn't done :/ 

It all comes down to communication, which is laking here a lot. Her sister tried to force everyone to accept her new relationship and not only that, she introduces kids to the mix which is awkward as hell when you don't even know the guy at all (and who seems very sketchy as it is) and you're still processing the whole affair thing on top of empathizing with the pain their old BIL is feeling, who is the guy they know and like and consider family. 

Idk, the whole situation is a mess. The sister took things too fast and expects everyone to just move on from it when it's not that simple. I'm sure that had she taken her time and introduced her new partner and kids after doing some damage control and explaining herself more then  they wouldn't be in this situation. After all, she must have know how her family felt towards her ex, and how beloved he was. And yet she decided to ignore that and push things too far."

With that already said, I think you're just ""odd"" looking, not particularly ugly. Maybe try taking your pictures less close to the camera, rarely anyone looks good that up close. Your hair is ok, although I do believe that shorter hair would make you look better. If you are trimming your eyebrows then don't, they look too thin for you. But if that's the way they are then maybe do what a lot of people do and try and make them thicker with makeup (but if you are uncomfortable with that then it's ok to leave them as they are)."
