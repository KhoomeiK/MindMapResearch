buildapc,fqlfwen,t3_gjh3zi,1589456957.0,"Well it depends on your needs but know this:
You'll get a pc that's is around 2x as powerful (sometimes more depending on the price range) for the same amount as youd get a laptop. You pay a lot extra. Especially if you already have a monitor and keyboard (mouse you'll have to get with laptop also).

Part of this is that for instance a 2060 in a laptop =/= a desktop 2060. The desctop version will cool better and run faster almost every time. Especially on lower budgets.

Same goes for cpu. A laptop cpu does not equal a desktop one. Just look at their wattage. There is no way 5, 15 or 25 watt cpu are even a match for 70-120watt desktop cpu.

So keep that in mind. And also that a desktop is easier to fix, will last longer most of the time and is upgradeable. But being portable is a big advantage too. So if that is something you need. A desktop just isnt portable."

I currently have a sennheiser game one as my headset for anything I do on my pc. Currently this is plugged directly into my motherboard (gygabyte z270xp-sli) without any additional audio devices.

Something I've been seeing a few times appear on drop is the sennheiser hd 6xx combined and THX AAA 789 dac.

Obviously the latter would be an upgrade sound wise, but how noticable is that upgrade over an already fairly decent headphone like the game one? As that combination would be 500 bucks it's not exactly the cheapest upgrade. But would it still be something worth getting?"

Of course this depends on how much so. If the motherboard is a 65 bucks motherboard it is probably pretty terrible and might cause issues. And if the better motherboard is amazing there might be something said for that as well if you upgrade the cpu later.

Lastly it heavily depends on the processor too. You could have a topt tier i7 6th gen vs a low tier i7 9th gen and it could also matter a lot.

I must say I did notice the drive slow down dramatically in the process of moving my steam games over. But that was only after moving over 150gb of games after that it was very noticeable that it was quite slow. But tbf how often am I ever going to do that again? That was just because I was moving these absolutely massive files. And at this price difference I just find it really hard to justify spending that much extra for these situations I'll barely ever be in. Hope you also enjoy it if end up getting it"
buildapc,fnzu0h1,t1_fnzsf4h,1587400737.0,"What I'd recommend is a crucial p1 instead and get the 1tb version. I got this exact drive actually just a few days ago.

Difference is negligible in real life usage. Even in benchmarks they arent far apart (although benchmarks dont really give a fair comparison. A benchmark is worst case scenario).

The thing is that these drives have a 100gb cache that's nearly the same speed as the evo is. On this part they will be pretty much just as fast. It may even be faster as the cache on the 500gb evo is just 512 MB as opposed to the 100GB of the crucial drive.

The real difference comes after that. The samsung is a TLC drive (triple layer cell) TLC is a fairly fast memory type that will perform quite well, even when the cache runs out

Crucial p1 is a QLC drive (quad layer cell). This is a much denser type of storage but in the case of ssds that makes them considerably slower. Even to the point of a harddrive beating them in some things.

Since the crucial p1 has that huge cache though you'll never actually write directly to that qlc part. And you wont even notice it's there. And reading it you shouldnt notice either.

This means that unless you frequently move huge files of well over the 100gb cache size, you wont ever notice the difference. (Note that downloading things like games is not fast enough to fill the cache up so that's not a problem either).

Right now I would not recommend any other nvme drive to anyone exept the most demanding of professionals and they should probably go with something like the samsung pro drives instead.

(If youd like to know more about these drives you can look up one of the youtube videos people have made on it. It doesnt really matter if you look up the crucial p1 or the Intel p660. They are pretty much the same)
(Ignore the video made by linus tech tips for the most part btw. They where unfairly harsh towards the negatives of the drive and doesnt apply for most people, I'd recommend pretty much any other video)"
buildapc,fnzhtsb,t1_fnzh75y,1587394353.0,"They wont, the only whay that would happen is if you move a file that's larger then 100gb from 1 nvme drive to another nvme (even a little more then 100gb as the cache will clear itself while it's working) if you move the game from an ssd it would still happen but at an even higher amount of gb as the drive has more time to clear the cache

Downloading games will not slow down the drive as it's very unlikely your internet speed will beat the speed of the drive and even if it does, the cache will have plenty of time to clear while running to install any game currently out.

Even if it where true and you would reach that 100gb cache that slowdown to hdd speed would only happen then. At that 100gb, not any earlier. And how often are you moving a 100gb+ game? And do you really care if that takes a little bit longer?

And no that drive doesnt cost the same. Not here anyway. That drive you mentioned costs about 160-170 euros here (for the 1 tb). While the crucial p1 cost about 110 euros here (also 1 tb)."

Also retracing support seems to be pretty cool. While it's not all that developed yet that could be a nice feature when they do. But as I said I definitely dont know enough about AMD right now to say whether nvidia would be better or not."

buildapc,fnz754y,t3_g4rq7j,1587387779.0,"Intel is really only a good choice right now if you are dead set on gaming and gaming only. Otherwise AMD has better options what are like 2% slower in games but 50-100% better in anything else at the same price. 

Aio liquid coolers provide very little to no benefit over a good air cooler. Only get this if you really just want it for looks (or if you dont have space for an air cooler)

If you change to amd you'll need a different motherboard like the tomahawk. If your sticking with intel that motherboard is pretty pricey. I'd go cheaper to like 120-140 bucks. Also I'd skip the wifi. Costs extra and on board wifi isnt known for its reliability. If you need wifi I'd go with a non wifi board and just add a pci wifi card. These will probably perform better then the on board wifi.

Get 3600mhz ram instead. Doesnt cost much more. Skip the 32 gb. Its overkill for gaming. 16gb is more then enough right now. And you could always just add 2 more dims to make it 32gb later. (Only if you do professional work there might be a use to 32 gb)

Psu is fine

Ssd, I'd switch to either a crucial p1 drive or an intel p660. Both of these are nearly half the cost of Samsung's drive. Yet you'll be hard pressed to ever notice the difference. (Also, go with 1tb instead. Those have more cache then the 500gb ones and will be faster)

Case, I must have missed it earlier but I see you want mini itx, much of the same still applies though. Case is fine but something to keep in mind for the mother board. Also be aware that a mini ITX board will have less features then a full atx board and will also probably cost more.

I'd not upgrade the ram though tbh, instead spend the money you are planning to spend on a graphics card as good as you can get. That's going to make a way larger difference then upgrading the ram.

I'd recommend buying upto a 2070 super (if that's within your budget ofcourse). Going over that wont get you as much bang for your buck. If you have budget remaining after that you could consider upgrading ram as well but I'd definitely not put it at the same priority. The gpu is more important.

(Another thing, if you do upgrade your ram and get 2 extra dims. Do not just install all 4 you would have. That will mean they will all run at the speed of the slower 2. You would have 32 gb ram though, but unless you need that amount of ram that wont help your performance. It would be better to have 16gb at the higher speed.)"
buildapc,fnythiv,t3_g4hica,1587375050.0,"Well probably should've asked before ordering :P but anyway here is my thoughts.

Let's start of with that it will definitely work and will be quite a decent pc. None of your choices where bad ones and everything should work.

There is some things you could have improved a little though. You picked quite an expensive motherboard for instance. That tbh looks pretty good, but despite its price. Only comes with 2 m.2 slots. Had it been more it might have been worth it. But I'd probably have gone with something more in the 140 euro range.

The the ram, 3000mhz is not an issue. But nowadays 3600mhz is usually only a few bucks extra and I'd say that's worth it.

As for the ssd, you went with samsung, which makes great quality ssd and tthey are really good. However the crucial p1 drive or the intel p660 drives are going to be indistinguishable by anyone other then maybe the most demanding of professional users. They will last more then long enough and cost a lot less then the samsung one. (I'd simply have gotten a 1 tb one of these. They come with more cache that way and should be about the same price as the 500gb samsung one)

Last point, the video card. Unless you got a really good deal on that video card. As in nearly free. It isnt a great match. Its definitely the weakest link in your system by far. The rtx cards. In particular the super versions are much better deals nowadays if you're buying new. This cpu should at this moment do fine with any card so dont worry about that. If you want to do an upgrade in the future, I highly recommend just replacing the graphics card and leaving everything else. The rest should be fine for quite a long time.

Then that gpu is pretty low end, youre barely spending 20% of your budget on the gpu. Ideally this should be around 35% if you can. Id look for at least a 2060super here.

A 5400rpm harddrive is quite slow, bumping that up to a 7200rpm one would be better

The samsung nvme drive you picked is pretty expensive, I'd go with the crucial p2 drive instead. For the same price that will get you a 1 tb drive instead. Doubeling your capacity while the performance is the same in 99% of situations.

Then, motherboard seems quite pricey. I'd look for something more reasonably priced. Something around 120-140 should do just great as well

Lastly, I'd not buy the operating system for that price if you where planning too, you can buy windows 10 for much cheaper then that"

I'm not saying that those boards offer some sort of great audio. I'm saying that's it's more then plenty for gaming and also music for most people. Paying another 100 bucks isnt going to be worth it for most people.

I also said that internal dedicated sound cards where not worth it. Not necessarily external ones. If you really want better sound those can be worth it. But I question if someone wanting to use it for competitive fps wants to spend 100 bucks at least on that"
Gaming_Headsets,fm1vy1m,t1_fm1qw4o,1585685979.0,"It depends what you compare it too, I meant the audio of my motherboard is fairly decent for its price and compared to other motherboards of similar price.

And yes, I did get a fairly low end sound card. Still though, that card was 80 euros or so. And if you've got a budget of 300 euros max that really is about as much as you can spend on that if you also need a headset and mic. So what I said was that that's just not worth it."
Gaming_Headsets,fm1o74t,t1_fm1jcoz,1585681993.0,"Mod mic isnt the best sound but fine for coms in game or talking on discord. And its convenient. Good option. If you want better sound it will quickly start costing a lot of money and youd need about your budget for the mic alone.

Dedicated sound card is not worth it in my experience. I use a gigabyte z270xp-sli motherboard which has decent onboard sound. I bought an asus strix soar soundcard which offered no noticable improvement what so ever. I returned the card for that reason. I've just used the onboard sound since then.

I'm sure a dedicated external dac would get you better sound, but again. This is will soon get pretty expensive while being unnecessarily for gaming."
Gaming_Headsets,fm1ndfw,t1_fm1imvb,1585681558.0,It's not? I thought it was otherwise the same
Gaming_Headsets,fm19gsw,t1_fm1922w,1585674396.0,"I dont know, havent used those. All I can say is that the sound from mine is great, and it's about the only headset I've owned so far that I can literally wear as long as I want. I've worn it for over 8 hours at a time with absolutely no wearing fatigue what so ever."
Gaming_Headsets,fm16nbq,t3_fs98vm,1585672960.0,I've got the sennheiser game one which I absolutely love. But that is open back. There is a closed back version (sennheiser game zero) but I dont know how that performs in comparison. It should fall well within your budget though and comes with a good mic.

civ,flrhsl2,t1_flr77sr,1585420479.0,Yeah? From what I've seen it just doesnt seem worth it. I've got hundreds of hours in civ 5 and still play it. What kind of improvements?

BisexualMen,fklse4b,t3_fj0x8p,1584313546.0,I do it a ton. Its not even that long ago that I admitted to myself I was bi. It took me quite a while to realise. Still I question a ton of times if I'm actually bi. Especially since I've never done anything with another guy. Other times I feel like I'd get into 10 gay orgies in the same weekend if I could. It just really depends but i think of that whenever I'm in doubt. If last week I had a ton of gay thoughts but this week only straight ones that doesnt mean I'd suddenly be straight now

NoahGetTheBoat,fk9bju1,t3_fgvp5q,1583972700.0,"Honestly I feel kinda sorry for them. That they have that attraction. I do believe that they dont have a choice in their attraction. They do however definitely have a problem. Also acting on those urges is most definitely a choice. And if they do, they are disgusting creatures that deserve to rot. But things like this I think may actually help prevent child rape or pornography. While it disgusts me, I do have to agree that this doesnt harm any children. Even if it looks like one. Therefore I think this would be a good thing. People with these urges do very much still need help though."
Warthunder,fk80ouo,t3_fgtj2f,1583947156.0,"this is just one of those tanks that just dishes out meme driving like it was made to do it. The amount of funny shit i done in this thing. Everything from creating an impenetrable landship (front t95, middle 2 turret heavy tanks, rear reversing t95) to walls of death with several t95/28's in a line all slowly advancing. Its not the best tank and can be a bit frustrating at times but it can also be so much fun"

BisexualMen,fjk0esx,t1_fjix0wn,1583417138.0,"i right now treat it a similar way, wouldnt deny it if i was asked if i was asked. But dont really tell people either. I did talk about it with my best friend a while back after more then a few beers. Nothing to much detail though, it was only just after discovered my sexuality myself so just didnt know much anyway. Reason i told him was because i wanted to talk to someone about it. Wasnt the best conversation though, not that he had any problem with it. I just had no idea myself how i felt."
BisexualMen,fjdd8wn,t1_fjc141y,1583250921.0,"Could very well be. I was very late with even recognizing myself as bisexual. That was like 9 months or so I think. Since i liked women I just never really thought about it before that that bisexual was a thing men could be too. I had gay thoughts but I kinda just assumed it was because I just thought they where nice. I also fantasised about gay things and watched porn of it but rationalized that as a kink. (Thinking back about it, its truely amazing what you can make yourself believe :P).

I've never had anything at all against gay people, I've not been around that many though. Right now I know just 2 and they are acquaintances at best. Bi people a few but same thing, none that I'm really friends with. Might be part of why especially at the start I really didnt see myself in any sort of same sex relationship.

Over those months I guess it just got more and more confusing. I'm quite an independent person and being single doesnt upset me at all, but you know that feeling when sometimes you just wished you did have a SO? I noticed that changed from wanting to be with a girl to also pretty often wanting to be with a guy.

I just dont really know anyone to talk to about this which is why I'm talking here. Just need some help understanding."
BisexualMen,fj7t1kg,t3_fc0ro1,1583097676.0,"Right now my life is just really confusing to me. Not just with this but some other things study wise are having me really confused about what it is I really want. I'm 20 so it's not like I'm just hitting puberty or anything like that. I feel like I should know what I want. As a kid I felt like I always knew exactly. I knew what study I wanted to do since I was 12. Yet, now I've been doing it for 1.5 years I dont know anymore if it really is what I want. Same as my sexuality. I always thought I was straight. Eventually I kinda realized I was not and I had never been straight. I've just gotten to a point where I have no idea what it is I want or who i even really am.

SolidWorks,filo2ga,t1_filitmd,1582506180.0,"Solidworks did complain about ram, but that was actually the only thing that was fine, so not quite sure why. I've had that pop up more often. But usually I'm at like 60% ram usage. With this I was at 75% or so but still shouldnt have been a problem"
SolidWorks,fikyw6y,t1_fikyiiq,1582490022.0,"Yeah true, I changed a few things during development. But I always do just a single render as test to see if it's all good. I do pretty decent renders but it's usually just the model I'm working on and nothing else around it (exept maybe a very simple background). The ones I make now are about 6-10 min renders on my gtx1070. Those arent to bad.

What mostly made a difference for me is that I didnt actually know visualise was a thing for quite a while. Made my renders directly in solidworks the 1.5 years before that. That's only cpu though. Made a huge difference rendering on gpu instead"

Probably would have barely been any slower if I just put it in the queue instead but this way no need to load that into visualise and I was getting dinner anyway. Also, I doubt I'm going to get much sleep tonight unfortunately. Need to have this project finished tomorrow and the essay that goes alongside it is far from finished 😓"
