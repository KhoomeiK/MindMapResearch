i had a really big crush on this guy at my local store bc he was the Sweetest guy i had ever met. and so i told my friend about it n the reaction.. was not what i expected. ""wait, him? uhh... ok... isn't he kinda, ya know, unattractive?"" :(

i wasnt thinking of that, plus, i actually thought he was cute. i got that he wasn't perfect whatsoever, but i still liked him. 

so i dont really care about looks when the person themselves is 10/10. im sure other people wouldnt like it though lol. i get what youre saying."
