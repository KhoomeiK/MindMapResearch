Basically, you get long periods of depression or stability and short sprints of ""hypomania"" which is a calmer version of mania and means extra energy, impulsivity, hypersexuality, and high mood.

I remember when getting my psychology degree, they teach you that dissociative identity disorder is still not considered real by a portion of clinicians. But those who do recognize it say it is a protective shield against trauma, particularly sexual abuse. This episode was like my abnormal psychology textbook come to life as a modern Shakespearian drama.

I like power plays. I like knife-to-your-throat, tell-me-your-weakness exchanges. I like a little forced humanity. But something about the brain feels soft, untouchable, like a newborn. You don’t mess with that. You don’t put that precious thing at gunpoint and strip it of all it’s protections. You don’t put a man in an unsafe, unstable, emotionally dire situation and ask him to hold a burning object in freshly skinned hands.

Rami was elegant and devastating.

Elliot became so small at the end there, and you want to let him live there for a while, where his pain doesn’t have to take up so much space. Even though you know that he is enormous. That he is his own inner shield. That he saved his sister. That he brought down the world for the dream of a good father. It is so much to see that enormity crushed by pain.

I was moved by the episode, and I think the sacrilege of violating Elliot’s brain is just the beginning. I’m not prepared."

MrRobot,f3vztkv,t1_f3vvahu,1571188630.0,"Here area a few examples of what I mean:

The book on Elliot's prison desk is Resurrection, by Tolstoy. Resurrection explores Georgianism, the economic philosophy that there is worth in individual human achievement, but that natural resources should be shared equally with everyone. In Elliot's regimented prison world, this is the book he chooses as the one anchor to himself. The book, much like season 2, slips into a bizarre fever dream. It doesn't end well. But it's just a damn book, right? It might as well be a siren.

There is a single, lonely door stop behind Dom when she flips her red hair during The Moth & the Flame.

When Mr. Robot and Elliot are arguing about power, they walk by a sign that says ISA 41:10. Isaiah 41:10 in the Bible is: “So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous.” All this over another sign that says “Hell is real.”

When I say every item is an anthem, I mean that items have purpose. They have strong stories to tell. They make statements that echo major themes of the show."
