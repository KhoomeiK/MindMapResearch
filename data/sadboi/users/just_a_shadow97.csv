Advice,fmj6300,t3_fvku2h,1586123778.0,"Well you don't have to go to an expensive art school. You could always just do short courses and classes to improve your skills and work your way from there and really see where your creativity can take you. 

I think maybe if you think about what other jobs you could pursue that require artistic skill it could be a great starting point for example maybe getting into graphic design / cartoon artist / illustrator. 

The other option is to just use art as your hobby for now until you really figure out the best thing to do. Maybe see if you could sell your work at local arts and craft markets or online and see how you do. 

These are just a few ideas but I do hope you make the choices that will make you happy!"

In a way you want to start cutting all ties as to not have anyone to disappoint.

‚Ä¢ Develop mechanisms that help you cope with stressors/triggers (maybe google some to get started) so this can be anything from breathing exercises or just simply walking out of the house and walking back inside. 
‚Ä¢ Set short term and long term goals, write them down/ make them visual so you can tick them off or get yourself a reward if you reach them. 
‚Ä¢ Talking to people who have gone through the same experience who have come out on the other side 
‚Ä¢ Talking to someone you trust that might understand  and help you reach your goals like a family member or friend. So basically just building a solid support system)
‚Ä¢ Exercise / getting outside (both help lift mood and gets you doing something)
‚Ä¢ Accepting that you are depressed and will probably always be but know that you can live a fulfilling life 
Do things you enjoy. So if you're good at drawing or whatever just do it! Even if it is just for 10 minutes)
‚Ä¢ Not being too hard on yourself 
These are some things that have worked for me / that Im currently trying. 

Also if you ever just want to talk to someone you are welcome to message me / chat. 

I know this is really general advice and you've probably tried a lot of this already but I really hope this helps in se way"
