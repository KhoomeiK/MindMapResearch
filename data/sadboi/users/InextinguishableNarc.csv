ADHD,footc8z,t3_g8focc,1587946031.0,Woo! Yay to having good days after a period of depression - it's been the case for me today too. <3
depression,foi4me4,t1_foi1rtq,1587778606.0,"Talk to a mental health professional if you can - if you speak to your primary care doctor they will probably refer you to one (psychiatrist, counselor, etc) and that person will be able to properly evaluate and diagnose you. Nowadays a lot of doctors are doing over-the-phone/video appointments and such (including therapy) so I say call your doctor and see what they have to say!"

I absolutely love it - it hits at exactly the right length and was only $4, but now I'm having trouble styling it. I'm considering hemming it so that it hits more at a midi length than maxi but even so, how can I wear a material like this casually?"
SuicideBereavement,fo28xp3,t3_g07adf,1587453574.0,"I went through something similar several times. I’d dream that my friend had faked his own death and came back to tell us it had all been a big joke. I saw his friends and family find out, I hugged him and yelled at him for putting everyone through so much pain. I felt so much relief in the dream that I kept having to wake up and remind myself it wasn’t true. It seriously sucked to wake up. The dream itself felt like coming up for air, and then waking up was like being forced back down underwater. 

I’m really sorry. Lots of love."
femalefashionadvice,fmd9bvq,t3_fud95a,1585962272.0,"Every morning when I get up, I have to get fully dressed as if I was going to school like normal. I deal with wacky mental health and have difficulty getting motivated when I'm at home in general; if I get dressed then the likelihood of me feeling groggy and going back to bed when I get bored goes way down. I wear a lot of leggings and easy crop tops/t-shirts anyway, but as someone who never has enough time in the morning to get ready properly I actually tend to look more put together now than when I had to be anywhere. Outfits more cohesive (I'm wearing stuff I usually don't put in the time to style!) and I've been wearing a full face of makeup and accessorizing. My family is like ""you don't ever look this nice out of quarantine when you actually have to be seen."" lol, but also I don't have to wake up at buttcrack dawn to go take care of stuff at my lab either anymore so."

You might benefit from seeing a therapist if that is the case; a lot of people find themselves lying about fairly innocuous things and struggle to understand why, and a professional can help you identify what might help you stop."
SuicideBereavement,fh2286u,t3_f139e0,1581231990.0,"Everything you said is spot on something I’ve been feeling the past week. I was out listening to my friend’s boyfriend’s band play at a festival yesterday and I just burst into tears because it was beautiful and it made me sad. Everything I hear or see reminds me that he won’t ever see any of it again. I’ve been having trouble keeping him out of mind because even beautiful things make me feel this sad lost feeling.

I think I’ve been kind of traumatized by this too. It’s just unbelievably jarring. I can’t really do anything I enjoy (I’m also prone to depression). The world feels darker, and I’m having trouble understanding how the world isn’t all just bad and scary if something like this can happen. I can’t believe it’s real, it almost feels like someone should be popping out and saying “jokes! he’s actually alive and right here and it was all a prank.” 

I don’t know what to say to help you but I’m right there with you. All anyone around me can do is say it’ll take time and rub my shoulder. But really I just want to stop feeling sad and thinking about a tragically young lost life full of potential and live my life. I’m tired."
SuicideBereavement,ffkrzwq,t3_eu0rnd,1580027850.0,"I have a horrible memory in general, but emotional details of memories tend to stick with me hardcore. Still, I worry that I’ll forget things about him. Whenever I think of a memory with him, something he said, a time we hung out, parts of who he was or his interests, I take out a word document and type it out with as much detail as I can remember. I squeeze my eyes shut and I try to remember the physical sensation of holding his hand the last time I saw him in the hospital.

I’m sorry for your loss. The way you described this haunted feeling is something I’m currently experiencing too. I wish you the best moving forward."
SuicideBereavement,ffh1nh1,t1_ffg18uw,1579920704.0,"We used to play a lot of Minecraft together and I sucked A LOT but he would basically do everything and I’d follow him around like a puppy. :) He tried to teach me CSGO one time but I got so overwhelmed within 5 minutes that we switched to this PC multiplayer golf game. Also, we played this puzzle game together in person that I can’t remember what it’s called. Also Overcooked! I love Overcooked. He was a big gamer and I just did it sometimes because I wanted to spend time with him LOL. Thanks for saying that about him. I’m glad I conveyed that."
