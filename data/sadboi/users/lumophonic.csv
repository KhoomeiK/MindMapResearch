creative,fqoo60z,t3_gj5488,1589520066.0,Beautiful! Looks like a digital painting sometimes with that smooth blending :)
creativecoding,fpmjciq,t1_fo2t0mf,1588734342.0,Yes! Interesting collection of robots you got there. Do they expose an API for movement?
Unity3D,fpe5ouy,t3_gcx8m3,1588540861.0,Looks cool and abstract!

functionalprint,fcfr1ey,t1_fcdnaej,1577632880.0,Some clay from craft stores might be handy too.
futurebeats,fcfqdx4,t1_fcegv3p,1577632708.0,"Thanks. Music was produced in FL studio, then exported to MIDI/layer files. They are palyed back in Unity, and modi events/FFT of audio affects objects in the 3D scene like lighting, object creation, scaling, etc. This project took about 16 hrs, but I've been working on the ""music to animation"" framework for several months."
gamemusic,fcc9wfl,t3_egsbh8,1577595998.0,"Great job! The tap for the high note was a great idea.

I worked on this same song a while back, this is such a fun thing to play."

What material is the reflective stuff btw? Looks like the thing inside CDs"

ambientmusic,fc14vrg,t1_fc0f4tj,1577308330.0,"Thank you. Yes, I played the keys myself. More like drew them with a mouse on a piano roll :) These are all builtin synths in FL Studio's Sytrus/Flex. The 'bird sounds' come from the tail of the keys at the beginning being superimposed. They don't sound much like birds in isolation."

creativecoding,epmzuud,t1_epltjyw,1559319403.0,"I did not generate MIDI in Unity, I exported MIDI from my digital audio workstation (FL Studio). I have my own visualizer library (not public yet) based on Leslie Sanford's MIDI Toolkit to make objects in Unity react to MIDI. Unity has built in methods for FFT."
