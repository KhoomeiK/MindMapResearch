gamecollecting,fkdk7p8,t3_fgt4q7,1584082030.0,"Great insight, thanks folks. Looks like the general consensus shows that investing in video games isnt a great idea. 

On the flipside, what about say 30-40 years from now would a rare Snes game be seen as perhaps an ""antique"" and be valuable in that sense?"
oneplus,fkdk05m,t1_fkddigg,1584081780.0,Mine worked fine for 2 days. Played up 1 day so I cleared the cache (on instructions from the OnePlus tech team). It was fine for another few days and then played up again. Pretty disappointing for a brand new phone

As someone who's gone through it, my advice to you is get rid of her ASAP. Someone who cheats on you yesterday or today, will have the ""ability"" to do it again in future. 

Tell her to go to hell and block her imo."

Health,ezq92eg,t1_ezq27kp,1568056275.0,Yes. But I smoked cigs 3yrs - never experienced such horrible symptoms as I did with the Juul.
Health,ezpw7t7,t3_d1nqet,1568049983.0,"Interesting that a Vitamin E derivative is mentioned in the article. I was on Juul for 9 months & taking a multi-vitamin supplement recently. At the time, I started experiencing severe anxiety, panic attacks & severe shortness of breath for no reason.

Went to see a neurologist (top private one in London) to rule out anything sinister - luckily no brain issues. He did however tell me to ditch the multi-vitamins as Vitamin E increases your heart rate. 

Quit the vitamins - had no change. So, quit the Juul and my anxiety massively improved. 

In my experience, vaping has been significantly worse than smoking cigs.
 
At least with cigs, you know how its killing you. With vaping you have no idea, and thats the worst part."

juul,ex88mch,t3_crokcu,1566070173.0,"Just to chime in - I smoked cigs for 2 years. Then used the Smok for 2 years. I've used Juul for around 9 months now. Started on half a pod per day and it crept up to 2 pods per day (as the addiction for nicotine got higher and higher).

In the last couple months, Juul has caused me breathing problems & bad anxiety. I done a test and smoked cigs for 1 week and the issues disappeared. 

If people can restrict Juul to 1 pod per day max, then its ok but I think anymore than that, and it will eventually give you health issues.  

Good job on the quitting - I will be joining you very shortly!"
