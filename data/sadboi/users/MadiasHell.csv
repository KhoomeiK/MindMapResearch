Lately things just haven't been great... I wrote a long spiel about how bad things are in detail, but I realized no one wants to hear that crap, so I'll just say it's been bad. The worst it's been in months. I'm in a toxic environment, in severe, severe physical pain that I cannot do anything about, struggling to balance physical health that won't cooperate and mental health that after a short stable few weeks finally just tanked, with NO emotional support of any kind.  And that's all just the tip of the iceberg. It gets worse, but I'll spare you that bit. 

Just to be honest, it's gotten really hard to even want to be here, I just wish I could disappear.

But if you can write me a card, just basic encouragement to go on in life would be appreciated. I understand if all your spots are filled or your supplies is used or simply if you don't want to do it. I can see how that might not be fun, so I don't at all expect it, but I would appreciate it."

New Leaf is a perfectly acceptable place to start playing, it's the best part of all the games for the most part and the some original content to round it out. The games are not at all story based so you only would need to play one to introduce yourself to it all, though I guess it is your pick what to play first.

I feel the same way when I have to leave out international people because I am running low on international stamps. I feel bad about it, but sometimes it just has to be like that I think. 

I know that when I first started on RAoC three years ago, i didn't see a lot, if any offers only for flaired users. But the sub was a lot smaller back then too. As the sub grows things will change. And depending on what you expect back, you have to pick and choose who to send to more nowadays.

I see plenty of offers that newbies can accept, and some people have started doing newbie only offers to make up for the flair only posts, which I think is a great idea. If you feel too bad maybe try making a post or two for newbies only? That should help balance it out some."

How do you make Holy Water? You boil the Hell out of it!"
RandomActsofCards,fgf1cdz,t1_fg71qiu,1580719113.0,Yay for feeling better! Mental health can be so difficult to handle sometimes so kudos to you for taking the initiative to get the help you need! I'm glad you are starting to feel better. =)
RandomActsofCards,fgf15jp,t1_fg79h0b,1580718839.0,Man aren't those people the best? Taking all that time out of their assumedly busy lives to pay attention to every comment you make? So dedicated. XD
RandomActsofCards,fgf0ss8,t3_ey3afg,1580718325.0,I'm in the US and could use some positivity if you're giving it. I'll PM you.

RAoC_meta,fge84yk,t3_expq8b,1580693527.0,"I have been meaning to make a carding travel pack that I can just grab if I am headed over to my grandmother's (which I go at least once a week) or if I have to go to IV chemo again or something, it'll just be a real easy thing to grab and go so I can do cards outside the house. However I can never decide what I might need or use so I haven't been able to make it yet. I have a lot of supplies and i like to be able to choose between all of it, but obviously i can't bring it all with me. Decisions are hard, though. Lol. It's also tough for me because I don't want my best supplies to get left somewhere and then I have to do without it for however long. But yeah, this seems like a very necessary thing for traveling if you get out a lot. I mean, I don't and it still seems like a good idea to me. Haha."
RandomActsofHappyMail,fge6vs1,t3_exctri,1580692730.0,"You're welcome! And take your time, there is no rush. =)"
RandomActsofHappyMail,fge6t3e,t3_exwgoa,1580692682.0,Oh yay! I'm so glad I could send you something you will use. =)
RandomActsofHappyMail,fge6iwu,t3_ex7wqm,1580692497.0,"If you have anything left, I would love to use some of the things you might send to make cards, please. If this offer is fulfilled it's fine, I just didn't see it say anywhere, so I thought I would just try to see whether or not it was. I have been loving making cards recently and in my opinion i can never have enough stuff to choose from when making cards, lol.

Oh almost forgot. The weekend is kind of over now almost, but one fun thing I did was spend some quiet time to myself writing in my journal early this morning. Seems a silly thing to think is so fun, but I genuinely have a good time doing it."

AnimalCrossing,fg8yn8f,t1_fg8e9bd,1580631729.0,"I think maybe you're right, but what concerns me are the younger players playing, or even older siblings who don't get along completely... what happens when one has an idea for the town the other isn't completely on board with, if someone builds something can someone else go and tear it down/move it or anything like that. It sounds like it would take a lot of cooperation and that may be ideal for the gameplay of this game, but it's not realistic to assume that everyone will be able to cooperate 100% and that this wouldn't cause bickering between some people, especially younger players. This doesn't effect me personally as both my sister and I have swifches and she bought us each our own copies, and even if she hadn't, we work really well together. But I am concerned for other people for which this might not work out as well, especially younger kids."
AnimalCrossing,fg8xktd,t3_exixq9,1580631173.0,Love it! <3
