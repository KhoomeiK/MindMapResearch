He said ""he doesn't like grown men walking around in his house"". My brother is about a year and a half older than me but I was always the problem child because of undiagnosed bipolar growing up. I also grew my hair out and pierced my lips which my Dad was less than fond of.

I stayed with friends for a while, and occasionally they'd let me come back and stay with them but it never lasted long. I moved out and never really came back at 17. Having to buy your own food at 14 while working and going to school was a struggle. Nobody knew what was going on except my closest friends that would convince their parents that I was just sleeping over for a week or two at a time... or sometimes not tell them at all. I once stayed at my girlfriends house for a week without her family knowing and would only come out from under the bed when they were gone. 

I had to learn how to save money and grow up pretty quick. My Dad and I have a much better relationship now and I've confronted him and hes apologized about it. We have a pretty good relationship now. Funny little tidbit, I ended up working with a guy about 8 years later who lived with the same family (my friends older brother) because he had nowhere to go. 

TLDR: I was kicked out at 14 by my parents because I looked too grown and had emotional stability issues."
