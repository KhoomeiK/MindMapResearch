AsianParentStories,fopn0n2,t3_g8rky1,1587965946.0,"My mom does it very often, I was asked to live with her after my parent’s divorce(due to her being abusive and manipulative to my dad, plus an alcoholic) due to her saying it so often. She drinks sugary canned cocktails, about a 6 pack at a time sometimes more, and has type 2 diabetes that both her father and mother died from. She asks me to go out with her knowing it’s just making me watch her slowly killing herself. 
I’m moving cities in two months(again) and have decided I need to finally completely remove her from my life as the anxiety of having to come home to my moms dead body has been eating away at me since we moved into a shared apartment a few months ago.
Both my dad and brother have quite literally told me to stop caring if she lives or dies and to stop trying to change her since it just pushes her farther off the deep end. If you do not choose to call the authorities I hope you have the ability to distance yourself and tell her that threatening to do such a thing is not healthy and it makes her seem unstable/in need of help. I hope you guys all get the help you need to get through this and past traumas with her."
AsianParentStories,fnx2h2l,t3_g449kw,1587330170.0,"Yup. But now my goal is to be the best mom ever and keep my shitty abusive family out of my kid(s) lives. I get upset about it often when my mom calls and tells me how mean and terrible I am for not wanting to talk to her(she’s an abusive alcoholic who forced me to hang around my family members who’s son molested me for years as a toddler because they were “family” still) and my dad is the typical strict, cold, unforgiving or forgetting asian father who never appreciated/celebrated anything I did or have accomplished. It sucks, but one day I’ll make up for that and end the trauma cycle with my own happy healthy family."
relationship_advice,fn93uys,t3_g0204f,1586758516.0,"My boyfriend of 3 years and I ended in a similar way, and I wanted to get back together with him for a while too. You just gotta distract yourself. And know that ANYONE who cheats on you once, MAY eventually do it again, in some way shape or form. And do you want to live with the anxiety of that? They are not trustworthy, they are not reliable, and they are not deserving of your trust and love. I promise, so long as you have a good heart, the love you give/deserve will come full circle. Right now is a terrible time for dating with this pandemic going on, but with that being said dating apps must be going crazy(I wouldn’t know I’m in a relationship currently from Bumble) and just having someone to talk to and take your mind off of them helped me immensely. I was open about it, which also helped, more-so just for myself than trying to find a date. I talked with a handful of people who had recently broken up and gone through similar too, so it was good to have someone to relate to. My friends and family were terrible support systems as some hated the guy and some loved him(even knowing he was a POS), so talking with them was confusing to say the least. You will get through this though!"
mentalhealth,fmup2nn,t3_fx2qdr,1586395841.0,"Mine has gotten significantly better!! Because I no longer have to go to work every day and fake a smile 24/7, drain myself verbally and mentally keeping small talk with older clients and coworkers, physically try to walk around like I don’t have a weight on my shoulders nobody can see(my mom is a high functioning suicidal alcoholic with a xanax prescription she abuses, and verbally abuses me though I literally do every thing for her including cooking all of her meals and cleaning her room/the apartment, and is currently living with my bf and I as my dad recently split from her and he no longer is there to keep an eye on her/monitor her drinking and suicidal ideation, and my older brother no longer cares). Simply not having to act like I am happy when I am severely depressed with generalized anxiety(and on medication + doing biofeedback on myself at work), and also deal with work stressors, has been life changing. 

I love my job, and at my lowest points it was/is the thing that keeps me going. But the rude parents and lower end spectrum clients I work with can be so hard to work with(keeping that fake smile) 5 days a week with such difficult personal life problems. I was also working overtime on top of this for the last three months(mom moved in 4 months ago), so I don’t get home till about 7:30-8 most nights when I’m at work by 9-9:30 am. Eating dinner that late after I cook it, and it sometimes being my only real meal of the day was just another thing bringing me down. Now I have time to make food and actually enjoy eating it!

Things are hard at home sometimes, but if I isolate myself in my room and avoid my mom at all costs/bite my tongue, things are pretty damn good. I’ve been quarantined along with all of them(we all got over the virus!) for over four weeks and I couldn’t be happier."
