GrowingUpPoor,fr10dq8,t1_fqq6rqq,1589810755.0,"I'm sorry, I thought I responded to this earlier but I guess not. I started out as a ""Video Teller"" but the equivalent would be just general call center customer service. From there I got into some mentorship programs (they allowed me time away from the phone, on the clock to do this). About a year after starting I moved to be a credit analyst, and about a year and a half after that another bank recruited me at a 33% pay increase (hopping banks every few years is the easiest way to build salary if you want to make a career out of it). After that, a friend of mine asked me to come help them at their small business (by small I mean a few hundred employees, so not scary small) and from there I was recruited by another business in the same industry where I was able to really negotiate benefits, salary, hours, and commission structure.

I can't overstate the benefit of the mentorship programs. A lot of people come in with a negative attitude (especially in a call center environment) and want to do the minimum required. That's totally okay from the perspective of your actual duties for the job, but the programs they offer will help a LOT. Learning how to write a resume, how to crush an interview, how to give presentations, how to communicate with professionalism, etc, all of those will help you for your entire life. It's also one of the biggest things that college graduates are missing, and why I've gotten jobs over people with degrees in the past."
GrowingUpPoor,fqpjmv8,t3_gk6c50,1589547970.0,"My advice: Don't worry about college right now. Large corporations will hire for call center customer service, since you already have work experience you'll be good to go. They offer insurance, internal training programs, and after 6-12 months you can transfer out of customer service. After 12 months they will pay for you to go to college and you don't have to stay after you get your degree. 

I got hired 2 weeks after I turned 18, worked super hard for a few years and even though I never went to college I now make more than anyone I know who has gone."

If you can't find a true RE then it would be worth it to see both an endo and your current doctor. I would talk to your OB about it because it would be best if they could work together. It also may be possible to find an RE that is further away and have them guide your treatment plan with your current OB so that you don't have to drive as far (mine is about an hour away and we have been sort of creative in this way before). 

As others have mentioned, it can take a long time to see endo or RE. Your insurance will dictate if you need a referral or not. RE's generally need you to have been trying for 12 months, but its worth calling anyway because it may take 3-6 months to get an appointment and they may see you earlier based on the fact that you have PCOS.

The reason that I mention RE's being better is because I honestly have had a great experience with mine, it's not just treating PCOS its 'We plan on getting you pregnant no matter what.' and they have been extremely thorough in looking at doing a LOT of bloodwork (everything from blood sugar to more horomones than i can name, vitamin levels, and even antibodies to ensure my childhood vaccines worked well enough), there was a lot of other testing as well to look at lining and fallopian tubes. It really is a fill picture, as opposed to a regular endo who would do a few things, and then an OBGYN that would do another. I have not been able to find an endo or an OB that is really willing to tackle both sides of the issue, so in my experience an RE is worth it if at all possible."

Hypothyroidism,fk8ov8p,t3_fh04pd,1583960101.0,"Levothyroxine was out a few weeks ago when I got a refill but they said it would only take a week or so to be back in stock. I was able to get Synthroid on time for $4 more. I would maybe just go for a refill a week or so early just in case, but even if your pharmacy is out, chances are there is another pharmacy in the area that has it. I don't think coronavirus is going to really have an effect, I work in logistics and for the most part everything is operating as normal. The only issues that come up are related to people panicking and changing their spending patterns as a result."
BipolarReddit,fk8j2oa,t1_fk81f89,1583956993.0,"I think it's normal for any mental illness to feel like it's all made it, to make a pun of it, it is technically all in your head haha. It's important to know that specifically because of your age your symptoms will change over time. When I was your age I was a rapid cycler (I would cycle in just a few hours and every single day) but my symptoms greatly changed and stabilized a bit over the next few years. The body goes through a lot of changes during your teen years and I definitely think it contributes to how messy mental illness is. I also think that definitions of mental illness are more based on adults which can further complicate things. I wish you all the best with your treatment, and my inbox is always open if you want to chat!"
BipolarReddit,fk8cd79,t1_fk87grp,1583953422.0,"It just sucks all around, but I'm glad you're being proactive and working on treatment. If either of you want to chat, my inbox is open. It feels like in a lot of ways many others don't truly understand."
BipolarReddit,fk80gmu,t1_fk7zmpb,1583947035.0,"Technically I believe it's possible to be drawn to anything, there are even people that romanticize things like migraines and rabies. But I would not consider it to be an attractive thing. It almost ruined my life on more than one occasion, and almost cost me my life on more than one occasion. I would also say that how media portrays bipolar disorder is generally pretty incorrect to be honest, at least as far as I've seen.

It's not possible to just be manic, if that's what you're referring to. And honestly, the more you are manic the worse it gets. It's exhausting and difficult to control for me now."
insaneparents,fk7ztdb,t1_fk7zfbu,1583946692.0,"It's really hard to tell because some lectures are important. But if it bothers you, you could try saying something like ""I understand your point and I'll try to do better going forward."" or explain to him how you feel. I certainly hope that you don't have an insane parent!"
IdiotsInCars,fk7zlgu,t1_fk7zg9y,1583946576.0,Profanity is my assumption.
BipolarReddit,fk7zdbp,t1_fk7w3di,1583946456.0,"Yes, that is the thing I take solace in. At least in my family, the cycle ends with me. It also helps to know that through treatment I am overcoming what my abuser never will. They hurt me, but they are in a never-ending cycle of self destruction. My life is harder than it should be because of them, but I will still have a good life, and certainly far better than they ever have or ever will."
