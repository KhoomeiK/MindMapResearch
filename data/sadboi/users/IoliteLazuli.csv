yuumimains,fqhtpw7,t3_gj17r8,1589384403.0,"I think Twin Shadows is a good item on yuumi for a couple of reasons, its both offensive and defensive. If your team has a lot of immobile squishies, using Twin Shadows could be the difference of the enemy assassin getting a free double kill. If you have a bruiser like Jax, you can hop on them, use the item, and chase people through the jungle. :D fun times

Just my hot take"

Talonmains,fme4op7,t1_fmc9igg,1585989211.0,"After the akali nerfs and the revert they did there, it is plausible that the riot balancing team can fuck up every once in a while. She dropped like a whole 10%, that's more what I mean in significant drops. No, the champ is not dead (as i went 12/3/smthin with \~200 cs in a recent game) but his tough matchups are becoming a bit tougher in early game."
Talonmains,fm6seo1,t1_fm6qpgl,1585801934.0,"to be fair, the nerfs hit him in a couple of aspects that are crucial to him; his wave clear is decreased, early game is much rougher and since he doesn't exactly ""scale"" he'll have a rough late game if he cant get picks, his roaming potential is decreased bc he can't just 2pt-w the back wave n' leave, his w is pretty important in his combos early game, etc. Not to mention riot attempting to make him a jungler and the w nerfs affecting his clear there + dmg.. you get the point.  Talon's snowballing is greatly impacted and as an assassin that is what you do. He is definitely going to be out shined by champs like Yasuo, Diana, Fizz, Kat, Qiyana, and so on. It just kinda sucks ;/

TL;DR- Riot just made it a lot harder to be a Talon main and is *potentially* going to come crazy at the rest of the assassins to ""balance out the meta"" so watch out kiddos. But he isnt ""***dead***"", just much more challenging to play"
Talonmains,fm6r38k,t3_ft69dn,1585800898.0,"Let's hope that Talon's winrate drops significantly enough for riot to see they messed up in nerfing and pull back a bit, thats best case scenario ;/ the dmg nerf on W's return was a *little* too much. His rake makes up for quite a bit of damage in his early game and combos, cmon riot"

I'm glad you found something to make you feel good! It becomes unhealthy if you use them to make you feel happy and spill problems onto. Keep things in perspective and be proud you found someone who makes you feel alive :D

But I would try not to call it ""improving your mental health"" dont label it like that. Just say you're having fun, you're feeling good. Make it more positive :D"
