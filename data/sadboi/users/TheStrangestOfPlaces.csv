There are a couple of cool sidequests and there's one really incredible moment in the main story, but the quests/story are the weakest parts of the game imo.

*However* , the world is absolutely phenomenal, Bethesda is just really good at telling stories that way. A lot of in game locations are made to show what happened there when the bombs fell which makes for a very interesting atmosphere.

The base building is a lot of fun too, even if it doesn't serve any purpose. I played the game for 400 something hours, and I always approached it as a sandbox. Explore all the locations, gather a bunch of materials, build some cool shit with it, and it's suddenly a very fun and unique game!"

trees,fnyylij,t1_fnywqlz,1587380481.0,"Well we have a really weird way of handling it.

Owning 5 plants is tolerated, but if somebody calls the cops they still take them away. 
You can only have those 5 plants outdoors, since growing indoors is illegal, as well as using nutrients or lighting. Since our climate's not really suited for weed either the legal way usually results in pretty low quality product, which is why many people still opt for the illegal approach. 

It doesn't make any sense, but somehow that's what the law says haha. It means that coffeeshops (it's what our dispensaries are called) have a lot of hoops to jump through and it's a really difficult, risky business to get into. It's better than most countries, but it's still a very broken and outdated system.

Since Cali and other US states are fully legal the whole industry is way more professional, quality is crazy high and getting weed is way easier too. I mean you can get it delivered to your home! There's consistent quality control as well, and everything's tested so you know what you get and how strong it is. This is always a gamble here!

I use Ableton since like 4 years now, but I used FL for the 6 before that. For me the main reason to switch was stability. When I worked for those companies I had to render tons of stems, like 50 or so per song, and FL doesn't work well for that, or at least the version I used didn't. For one of the albums I made I had 30-50 stems each for 12 tracks, and FL would crash after every render. I then had to restart, FL had to stretch all the audio again (another big reason to switch for me, FL doesn't do real time audio processing that well) and eventually I spent like 30 something hours rendering 12 tracks. Ableton would do this in 30 minutes.

Now that I've used Ableton for a while I feel like FL is kind of convoluted in the way it works. There's a separate window for everything (mixer, playlist, piano roll, patterns etc.), you have to rename the same thing in all of them if you want to keep organized (name the pattern, name the VST, name the mixer channel, and so on) and it just slows you down immensely. 
There are only 8 slots for effects, if you want more you need to make a bus, which is awful in FL as well. I mean, you can only use 4 sends? Why? 
Oh, and the sampler is an absolute mess. There's also no proper MPC style drum instrument, so if you want to use pads you have to use a 3rd party plugin or the stupid built in one.
Most of these issues with FL are because it started as a tracker, which makes sense. But it's not the 90's anymore and FL just feels very dated to me. 

Ableton has everything in 1 window, unlimited slots for FX, I like the interface a lot better and it's just way faster. The audio processing is far superior for things like stretching, pitching etc. and it's a lot more stable too. It still crashes occasionally, but way less than FL does. The sample/plugin browser actually works and most of the built in plugins are way better than their FL counterparts.
The interface can be a bit confusing to get into, so there's that, but you get used to it pretty quickly. I used FL for 6 years, but managed to be completely comfortable in Ableton after a week or 3.

Now I'm not saying you should switch or anything, because the best DAW is the one you like and are comfortable in. It's all personal preference in the end!"

I guess for me stims are more of an enhancer of my hobbies, as opposed to the chem itself being fun.

Side effects are still not really present, aside from a tight jaw and neck and high heartbeat, all of which are fairly normal on stims.

My batch is a clear, white powder with tiny crystal shards in there. Smell is hard to explain, it's not as out there as for example 2-FMA but it has a distinct chemical smell that lingers for a while after doing a bump! Haven't tasted it yet aside from the drip, which is always horrible haha."
