ADHD,f7dzpaa,t1_f7dizg7,1573638770.0,"I was fortunate enough to have a friend who at times would guide me through processing my thoughts and the steps I needed to take in order to bathe myself when our water supply was cut off for whatever reason. This was in high school and we were boarding students. It would be so overwhelming at times but she'd lovingly direct me, telling me to get my towel, soap, exfoliating gloves etc. I'm pretty sure that 90% of my friends won't know or understand what ADHD is but I'm very grateful to have had that one who helped me especially in a particularly challenging period of my life (which was high school, lol)."
