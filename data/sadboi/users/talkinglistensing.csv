RWBY,fn2fimv,t3_fxbsif,1586587203.0,"I thought that the whole reason Qrow got his name was because after he was born, their mother died and the tribe blamed him. So his whole ""bad luck charm"" self loathing started from the tribe raising him to believe he caused their mother's death. And they call him that because crows are bad luck.

So idk whether their mother was a tribe member before she died? But either way the tribe found them as babies if they witnessed the mom dying in childbirth."

snakes,fk2x3zn,t3_fg7l12,1583811295.0,"I have had my Cali King for almost 2 years (since he was a hatchling). I carefully inspect his poops and although I have never seen him vomit or regurgitate, this is what I found in his enclosure when I got home this evening. Should I be concerned? Does he need to see a vet? Any advice welcome. Thank you so much."
