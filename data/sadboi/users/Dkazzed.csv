Basically you‚Äôre getting a super bike feature in a $5000 bike which is great feature for racers, but I can see beginners who unfortunately have a tendency to fixate into targets also benefitting from this feature.

I will add though that 90% of the population gets bored of their 300 within the year. It depends on what your goal is for riding. I‚Äôve been on 125s and 300s for 5 years and 46,000km and finally moved up to a 600 because I can‚Äôt possibly get better track times. Not because I‚Äôm good, but because I‚Äôm at an age where everytime i try to go knee down, I pull a muscle. üò≠ But I rode my old CB300F across Canada and that was such a blast. It cruised at 130 km/h (80 mph?) all day long and topped out at 145 km/h (91 mph) GPS verified speeds. The speedometer reads 10% optimistic so when it indicates 100 (km/h or mph) you‚Äôre only going 91. 

Finally, I would recommend that you take a course. You‚Äôll get to use their bikes and learn a lot of things you‚Äôll need to ride safely, and then going with a 500 will be no problem. The 500 is Honda‚Äôs most versatile engine. Easy to ride for anyone who‚Äôs taken a course but has enough power and acceleration for experienced riders. None of their 500s have the IMU I‚Äôve described but not the end of the world."

I was comfortably cruising through the prairies all day at 127 km/h or 80 mph GPS speed. The CB300R is an amazing 315 lb wet which is only 8 lb heavier than my old nimble CBR125R, despite having ABS brakes which tends to add 4 lb to the weight which my 125 didn‚Äôt. 

Speaking of ABS brakes, the CB300R with ABS also has IMU which is an inertial momentum unit. It‚Äôs also known as cornering ABS although Honda doesn‚Äôt fully advertise it as such.
