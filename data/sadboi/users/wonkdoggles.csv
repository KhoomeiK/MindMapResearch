\- I would be surprised if the controller (in game, not the physical) would feel different going from PC to any console. Besides the fact I personally used an xbox-style controller for rocket league (among others) on steam, and also play it on ps4, there is no real difference to me between the platforms

\- While the overall experience feels fine/good to me, the first boss triggered me deeply, on like a righteous indignation level, and after googling about it, got the keen sense my issues stemmed from a design choice that greatly favors a narrow window of builds, but mainly an inferior control method - a 'controller' (as opposed to mouse/kb). It just felt like my character was stuck in jello, everything (except the bosses attacks of course!) had a crazy delay where I was repeatedly getting killed in a catch22... ""Do I die trying to drink this potion that takes 4 seconds to start the animation on because I will then need another 4 seconds just to turn my character AWAY from the boss... or do I die trying to dodge/dive/parry but get trapped in a hit box and then perish on the inevitable next swing?""

To avoid presumptions of locality, finances, availability-of-care, I would offer you this... Try finding the answers without the parent variable. Just find out what your medical/clinical options are at all, as a first step, and go from there. Keep yourself busy with this as your time and mind allow. 

Also, while I would never suggest it as a universally effective alternative to therapy and/or medications, at my lowest points, I have personally found solace in meditative-like practices. Not always, but sometimes I can alleviate anxiety and depression just by reflecting on how it makes me (physically/mentally) feel. Such as, ""I feel terrible. I feel worthless. Project is due tomorrow. No one will like it..."" - and then, when I can, I study the FEELINGS those thoughts and internal questions give me. When I am in a mental state that I can muster the effort for that... I find it erodes my preconceptions of what it is I call 'terrible', or 'worthless'. I have even used it to overcome a stomach ache from time to time!

As far as the 'how' in your title... I do not think there is a clean answer for you, even if we could nail that jello to the wall. What I mean is that the 'sterile' answer would be dismissive/uninterested in the 'when my parents' part, because the 'how' does not care about personal circumstances. Or to put it another way, the following two questions would have the same answer (technically/mechanically):

**How do I tie my shoes if my parents don't believe in wearing shoes?**

**How do I tie my shoes if my parents practice shoe-wearing?**

The question you are really asking, I think, is:

**How do I navigate this issue with my parents, as I am deeply aware of a massive conflict of interest within myself... self preservation vs family pleasing?**

*There are a lot of important jobs and functions in the world that do not get any credit or recognition.

My advice? Breeding is dumb, and an annoying RNG shithole (especially if you're playing SP). Why accept this last insult to injury that is ""Imprinting""? I don't bother with letting Dino's mature or mess around with their stupid imprint grind.

- look at baby dino

And if we aren't playing on official... The imprinting/baby process is artificial content, i.e. a pointless time sink on top of the other 20 RNG hellholes you crawled through to get to the breeding point. So here's how to actually imprint/raise babies in ARK (single player)

1. Look at Dino
2. Pull up admin console (googleable/easy)
3. ""setBabyAge 1"" (makes it fully grown)
4. ""setImprintQuality 1"" (makes it 100% imprinted)

Seriously, think about it ... You spent what ... 6 hours finding ""perfect"" parents... If you are lucky. Then what... How many more hours mating/waiting? Now how many more raising/feeding/imprinting?

Edit: the fans have been saying ""take my money"" for two decades, but Sony/Square had to wait long enough for people to not give a shit about extreme artistic licensing/changes before they finally agreed to take our money, meanwhile staying armed with a team of lawyers preventing any of the millions of people who have the time, talent and inclination to do just that, alone.

I will be gone before the remake drops (my bday comes first and my mind likes the idea of a nice rounded exit date) and I guess I'm just spewing my irrational (but somehow reasonable) opinions on an audience I would never in a million years expect to agree with me.
