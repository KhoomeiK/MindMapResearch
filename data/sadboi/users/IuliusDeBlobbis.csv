As much as I liked the Losers in Chapter One, Pennywise is the de facto protagonist. He's such a creepy, frightening presence that I would love to see explored in a more subtle, less on the nose way compared to what they did in Chapter Two.

The reason One is overall a more interesting take on the character compared to the sequel is that you're able to see and feel Pennywise's influence on Derry as a whole. The city and its inhabitants feel like this lurking, breathing collective entity.  
The ""Kill Them All"" scene, the librarian... It's something that Chapter Two tried to replicate in the scene set in Beverly's old house, but even then it was way too much on the viewer's face.
