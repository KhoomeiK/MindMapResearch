Sleepparalysis,fqzp3xh,t3_glmn94,1589772167.0,i experience something similar when i‚Äôm falling asleep but i‚Äôm not really sure if it‚Äôs SP. i‚Äôve read somewhere online that it‚Äôs actually normal for you to feel like someone is talking really loud in your head when falling asleep. Especially if it feels like it‚Äôs pure gibberish or just repeating words you‚Äôre thinking of loudly in your head.

depression,fqqlhw6,t1_fq8y5a8,1589567608.0,my mother‚Äôs like that except her viewpoint is that she had it worse then everyone else in america. She grew up in the philippines and was poor and claims she watched a man get shot in the head but she wasn‚Äôt traumatized by it. so that‚Äôs led her to think people who are sensitive and are able to put themselves in other people‚Äôs shows are just weak. it‚Äôs frustrating being only 16 and constantly having to defend people with trauma because she‚Äôs just so clueless.

truscum,fq8lyun,t3_gh50ui,1589169349.0,this is why as a cis person i read subs like these. otherwise i would‚Äôve been influenced by everyone else around me that bc i don‚Äôt act feminine 100% of the time i must be trans. this is a real issue teens and even young adults face now due to people on the internet claiming that gender is a spectrum and blah blah blah. it‚Äôs confusing and honestly defeats the whole purpose of fighting gender roles. like are woman allowed to act more manly or not?? we‚Äôre fighting to get rid of gender stereotypes yet here we are enforcing new rules at the same time.

eczema,fpmhv6s,t3_ge37tf,1588733416.0,i have the same problem too. i actually gave myself an undercut because i had a ginormous dry patch at the back of my head and i wanted to be able to treat it better. now today before washing my hair i saw huge flakes all over the front of my scalp and underneath my bangs. after washing my hair i now have red bumps all over the front of my scalp and i have no clue what they really are.
