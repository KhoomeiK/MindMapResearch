ADHD_partners,fqhco79,t1_fqe1h3q,1589374087.0,"This was hard to read, and I can't imagine how much worse it is to live it.
We usually refrain from giving advice here, so take this as just questions I thought about when reading your post.

To me it sounds like you're in a toxic relationship, ADHD or not, and he's using your stuff (20k) to force you to stay, he's making you believe the only choice is to leave with nothing. 

So my questions are: 

do you rent/own the apartment in both names? 

In my country there is a phone line and several ways to reach out for help for any type of domestic violence, which has spiked because of this lockdown. Do you have something like that? Even if your case doesn't qualify for violence, they might be able to help you out with options like how to legally allow movers in (it might not be his decision alone), among others.

Do you have a car? A place to go temporarily just to give yourself some space to think? 
Will he be able to lock you out of your things if you go away for like a week? Can he, legally?

Can you ask a friend for help moving some things, if not everything? I'd grab the most expensive stuff, or the ones that are meaningful to me. 

Then, finally, if the rest is lost because he kept it from you, can you think about it as the price of releasing yourself from a toxic relationship? 

Can you really stay two more years in there waiting for the movers to save 20k? (It most likely won't be two years until a vaccine, he's exaggerating a bit) In other words, if it comes to this, how much is your peace of mind worth to you?

I don't know so much about you, and your financial situation. But I wanted you to think about how there are always more options than the ones he's giving you, there is always a way out if you decide you need it, and people that will be there to help you through. 

I wish you peace, and safety, and send you a warm hug all the way across the internet. Be well."
ADHD_partners,fqh8lbe,t3_gh0g3m,1589371098.0,"Today is the third day in two weeks that he oversleeps and he's late for work. Somehow he sleeps past three alarms, and now a very annoying Clocky (alarm clock that's loud and runs away on wheels). We're long distance so I can't just go and push him out of bed. I tried calling him all morning but he doesn't pick up, and I'm getting worried that he'll be out of a job if he keeps at this. A job he loves and he feels he's good at. He'd be heartbroken if he were to lose it.

For context, he works from home because of the shelter in place policies, and he chose a very early shift months ago, which he's having trouble with now. He needs to be at his desk at 6:30 am. His bosses, very understanding of his situation, offered a later shift, at least for some time until he adjusts, but he chose not to take it. I don't even want to think about what's going to happen when he moves into daylight savings time.
This is just so nerve breaking, anxiety inducing, like watching a train crash in slow motion while being helpless."

End of semester is always hard for everyone, we get a special extra hard mode, I guess.

I'd like to think how my Migraineur Student Game Achievement Badges would look like sometimes... You know the ones: ""took a written final with blurry vision"", ""puked on the bathroom before entering the classroom"", ""passed an oral exam with aphasia"" (that was fun). It gives a sense of achievement instead of despair.

 I hope you're doing well, semester will be over soon."
migraine,fo96imb,t3_g6d2f6,1587611685.0,"I am so sorry you're going through this. I've been there recently, I was finishing my college final project (a mostly written essay that required long hours in front of the computer) with medication resistant migraines every other day. 

That shit sucked, the stress doesn't help, the glare doesn't help, the stupid zoom meetings all day really can go to Hell, and not being able to go for a walk when you're restless REALLY doesn't help at all. But I said ok, I'm playing this game in hardcore mode. It's harder for me than for everyone else, yes, but I'm not going to miss that deadline no matter what.

Every little bit helps, so I set all my devices to silent notifications, dark mode, minimum brightness, put on my blue block glasses and ice pack head band and I decided this stupid condition will NOT get in the way of my plans. 

I made the most out of my lucid days writing like a madwoman, and rested, used ice packs on my head, tried to workout/meditate/cry in bed / puked the rest of the time. 

 I did deliver that final. And doing it while sick is an achievement that very few people get. I feel proud of myself for that. 

Take the time to breathe every day and remember you're playing on hard. You're doing just as much as other people with half the lucid time available, or less. You're awesome!  And resilient, and dedicated.

You will get through these dark days,  find the thing/s that work for you, and get to tell migraines they can go to hell too. They're not ruining your plans."
ADHD_partners,fntj7az,t1_fnag7ie,1587242738.0,"I understand these feelings so much. You're not broken. Although your relationship with him might be, you react to his actions and he reacts to your reactions and it never ends. 

Sometimes I take those lonely days we were supposed to do things together to do things that count as showing up for myself instead. Working out, doing my nails, or rearranging my wardrobe. I take it as ""me"" time, and try to turn it into a safe space, even if the absence hurts. 

I have anxiety too, and I know how scary it is to start taking care of yourself. For me, it took me a month of  anxiety attacks until I mustered the courage to call a therapist. I don't know if that's the right path for you, but I do know that I only started improving my relationship with him after getting the help I needed for myself, first. 

You're not a loser, you're a beautiful person, capable of giving so much love, of showing up for someone you care about over and over again."
ADHD_partners,fntgnoy,t1_fnahblo,1587241269.0,"I feel this so much. He does this ALL THE TIME. To the point where I feel like an a-hole not accepting his invitations to make plans for the night, since I'm 90% sure something will come up. It's extra frustrating if you had alternate plans you changed in order to do something with them, only to be left alone. Nice! Indeed."

For a moment I was feeling like a crazy person, getting my own present. I guess we're so used to do things for them that getting the presents is not a big stretch? Or so tired of the dissappointments that we want a nice thing for a change.

After all the hurt from yesterday, I have been talking to him about all this, and I got us ""the ADHD effect on marriage"", we're reading it together. Maybe something will come out from there. I can only hope for things to get better."
ADHD_partners,fn6e23j,t3_fzvoq8,1586696692.0,"Yesterday it was our 5 year dating anniversary. We're long distance rn and because of travel bans we couldn't spend it together, which is bad enough. He asked if we could do something special at night (cook or watch a movie) only to totally forget when his new monitor arrived. He showed up at 10pm. The worst part isn't that. 
The worst part is that I'm so used to him standing me up that I wasn't even expecting him to show up. That I bought my own present because I knew I wouldn't get anything from him, and I thought 5 years means something, I wanted to make it special. It's scary to think how much I've grown used to expect the dissappointment.
I bought him something too, and it only made him feel worse. And he told me how he had all these ideas for gifts. Ideas mean nothing if I only get the missed dates, the empty spaces.
Saying sorry doesn't cut it anymore, and when I try to explain that to him, he thinks I don't appreciate his efforts. I just mean he needs to try something different, like set an alarm on his phone, because I can't be his constant reminder of things, or start therapy and build coping tools.
Yesterday was supposed to be a fun day, and I just feel... empty."

It feels so unfair that you did everything right and the world still spat at you. But you did all you could do, and you're doing all you can, even if right now all you can do is (reasonably) panic for the health of those you care about the most. 

And you posted here, which for someone with severe anxiety is a HUGE step forward. 

We're all here for you, some of us quietly wishing you good health and some of us so moved by your words that overcame our fears to answer and try to hug you through the internet.

migraine,fjaxrsm,t3_fcf529,1583182634.0,"That sounds awful! I live in Argentina and a couple of months of wait is normal, depending on your healthcare plan (private or public, coverage level) and how busy the practice is. In my case they gave me my first appointment 3 months away but also asked me to fill in a diary they gave me during that time, so I would get to the first appointment with useful information. But they do have an ER specialized in neurology / head pain clinic in this place, so if I need it I could go there. 

I hope you get them to squeeze you in sooner! But if they can't, hang in there, you've been living with this for 30 years, three more months is not much in comparison. I hope you get treatment and relief soon."

Last one by my best friend from college, whom has seen me arriving straight to the bathroom to puke before class and in class breaks, whom has had to deliver my projects for me because sometimes I couldn't make it to school.  And the worst part was I ALREADY DO F***G MEDITATION in the form of Tai Chi every day and she knows it! ""that's not real meditation"". To say I was furious is the understatement of the year. I don't mind the random nosy aunt suggesting homeopathy or other useless shit because they're trying to care for you, even if it's misguided, but it hurts when it's people close to you."

femalehairadvice,fednfrg,t3_eoknhk,1579015763.0,"That is a gorgeous gray that is painful to maintain (literally, that much bleaching makes your scalp scream). A good hair colorist would recommend you to bleach it in multiple sessions, and if you go that route, you could try something less high maintenance first, like having grey ombre / balayage highlights. The good thing about these is that you can see how the gray looks on you without damaging your whole hair and since they blend with your natural hair, the roots are less of a problem. You have to know gray toner is not like other tint shades and it last less so you'll need to use purple shampoo once a week  and redo the toner maybe once a month or two if you stretch it. 
If you do the full bleach you'll have to go for bleaching the roots often too.

I have a gray ombre on hair that's almost as black as yours and although is less hard to maintain than a full gray, I have to keep at it otherwise it  looks like straw. 

And my hair got really damaged so I live on Olaplex #3 (every two weeks)  and #7 after shower and Olaplex or Pureology shampoos to keep it soft and recover from the damage (those are worked best for me, YMMV).

So on top of everything else, maintaining it and keeping it from breaking is expensive. 

I'm not saying don't go for it, just know what to expect for.

I think either ombre or the full gray would look lovely on you, but I honestly love your hair like it is, it looks so healthy and soft!"

What I like is his way of blending reality and magic / the supernatural with such a casual stroke. You're walking down a street in Buenos Aires, turn around a corner and you're in Paris. You see the wonder of everyday things like the rain falling against a window. Things that wouldn't catch your eye otherwise, things that are magical now after you've seen them through his lense."

I found HS to be miserable too, but college was definitely better: the fact that I was surrounded with people of similar interests in design and I actually had things to talk with them helped a lot, I felt a lot less out of place. Also working on something you enjoy, even if it's stressful as all design programs are at one point or another,  is also a mood booster (it was Industrial Design for me). 
Deadlines can be stressful, so please take care of yourself, and remember that you can always ask for help, even if it's just having your sleep deprived friend that's working on the same deadline sitting next to you and solving problems together.

HaircareScience,ex2bges,t3_cr6o9k,1565966349.0,"I agree with the other comment about less is more, and visiting a dermatologist about it.

I can also add my experience with hair loss and breakage (but by far not as extreme). I have migraines, and when that happens, my scalp gets all tense and hurts on the migraine side (it feels like a bruise). My hair in that area grows thinner and dry and prone to breakage. What has been working for me is massaging my scalp until that tension recedes. The extra irrigation you get from the massage also helps with healthier hair follicles. But it takes a while to see results. 

And that's usually the case with any hair growth issue in my experience. I've had hair loss due to stress that continued for MONTHS after the stressing event ended. It's very annoying. So try to be patient.

I hope you can find an answer (and correct  treatment) soon."

Most likely they don't know much about the disorder, like most people. I was one of those people, I'm ashamed to say. My boyfriend has ADHD. And at first I didn't really understand how it affected him. And like your close ones, I thought ""hey, it can't be that bad"". But I changed my mind. I joined this sub, I started watching videos explaining the disorder, and reading all the experiences people here shared. It really dawned on me that I knew very little. I went back to my bf and asked for forgiveness, for not understanding before. I'm still learning a lot about it, but I have started to actively help him and be as supportive as I can.

ADHD_partners,esqxauy,t3_c8we5u,1562211797.0,"Well as a fellow gamer, I know the feeling of losing track of time and being surprised that is 3am when it was 9pm 10minutes ago. And I'm not the one with ADD, so I can't imagine adding that.

I think that you could change your approach. Yes, you're enabling him. But also you're putting all the burden of the change of habits on him. This is probably overwhelming and he just avoids it by more gaming. I know it's hard not to be resentful and not to be an enabler. It's a thin line to walk. Someone recommended me once to read books from AlAnon. They talk about relationships with addicts and at first I didn't understand how it was related, but codependency and enabling were common subjects. Maybe something like that could help you deal with your feelings. I can look up the books if you're interested.

As for helping him, have you considered trying a different approach? Instead of just asking him o change habits, make him part of the planning, do it as a couples task. Talk it out with him, try to find solutions together, make him a part of the plan. You need a regular schedule. So maybe your job is to help him plan it. Use gaming as a reward, limit it to x hours or certain hours of the day. He could ""earn"" two hours of gaming each day by doing the important chores first, or something like that. You'll have to find whatever works best, but you need to find it WITH him. Offer him help to set up lists of things to be done, reminders, alarms to wake up and go to bed, etc. He needs to feel that you're his partner, not the police.

You also need to make the list of things you need, and plan how to add them into the schedule as well. Like, quality time together once a week, or more hours sleeping together.

I don't know if any of this is going to help you, but it was the best I could think of right now.

I know how hard it is sometimes. I do get frustrated a lot, and it took me a long time to understand that his needs don't have to always trump my needs for emotional balance and health. Take care of him, but take care of yourself first."
