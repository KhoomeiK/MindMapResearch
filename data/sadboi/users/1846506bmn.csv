Im not Muslim, and I don’t agree with some of the tenants of Islam. However, I read the Quran in its entirety and spoke with many people regarding explanations and interpretations of it before coming to any conclusion (which even now is not a terrible one).

You are putting words in my mouth - sometimes the wellness checks do help. More often then not, they dont. Especially when forced. 

I am not talking at all about the SEPARATE issue of sending photos of self harm and manipulation, as you may have noticed had you read my first post to the end. 

You are the one acting like you have the only valid approach, saying “its a harsh lesson in reality” as if you know all. 

Nor did i say that “all experts agree with my opinion”. Just the majority. And that is what is important here. And what do you expect my link to be? *not* of my choosing? The choice of the little devil sitting on my shoulder? I linked it because it is a more concise and thorough compilation of the links to scientific articles and research. Do you expect me to copy-paste it all for you? 

It would be prudent for you to keep your mouth shut on issues that you have done no research on, especially when it is a sensitive topic like this. At the very least, don’t act like an insufferable know it all."

Calling for a wellness check will often do more harm than good - making people panic when they need comfort and a place to talk. Most times, admitting to being suicidal and self harming is not an indication of imminent suicide, but a call for help. 

The sidebar and rules in r/suicidewatch do a much better job of explaining than I do. Read them for more reference.

I think that might be the cause of women pressuring men, rather than threatened femininity? Then again, maybe it could be. I really cant claim to know."
