Psychiatry,fpfy82b,t1_fpe8cje,1588587984.0,"This. I've had so many diagnoses, gifted, hyper-sensitive, borderline, bi-polar, psychotic and aspergers. Finally i started to open up about my trauma's and what had happened to me and i got another diagnosis, ptss. My therapist had me read ""The body keeps the score"" nu Bessel van der Kolk. 

I realised that i might have a high co-morbidity, but developmental trauma and c-ptss explain waaaaay more about why i did and do what i do. I've been in trauma therapy for two years now and we're only now talking about healing. It took me 2 years to get everything i had kept bottled up, out. 

So, listen, learn, medication isn't always the answer. Sure, it helps but understanding yourself through psycho-education is equally important! Good luck."

CPTSD,fnow2ig,t1_fnorpqr,1587134694.0,"I took pictures of myself over a period of 12 years to see if the fear in my eyes was still there,  I've been told i look stratified. My hands used to shake like crazy, like i couldn't even write. 

My psychiatrist said it was because of the medication. I also have restless legs, again i was told it was because of the medication. 
I don't believe that anymore, medication has been reduced but sometimes my hands still shake uncontrollably and i feel the urge to walk around, pace around the house.

Now, on the bright side, after one year of trauma focused therapy, all those so called side effects of medication are almost gone. I still indulge myself, if I feel like walking around for a while will make me feel better, i just do it. 

Sometimes i eat walking around. I like to play chess but have a hard time sitting down so i just turn up the volume really loud so i can hear when it's my turn and walk over to the laptop. 

It does get better, i hope you're in therapy. That helped me the most. It's ok to be afraid, it's not fun but somethings are just really scary."
