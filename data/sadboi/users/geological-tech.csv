Charity,f5sp8gx,t1_f5rf36h,1572439326.0,I was referring to a reddit post in which you stated that you needed a dedicated phone line but you managed to borrow from family and were now working. Which was made roughly a month ago. But definately check out your local social services office there are grants and programs in place to assist with equipment etc.
Charity,f5qesyt,t3_dos0hp,1572376246.0,Because I always google anyone or any organization before I donate money first you should share this with family and friends I am sure your community would love to help out too. If you have no tools conduct this job how do you plan to pay for the internet etc month after month? Second if you have already been employed by this employer since sept 2019 how have you been conducting your job for the last 2 months? Why 1000 you don't need a high end computer to do that kind of work a 300 dollar special from walmart will get you by just fine. Also there are services in Canada that will assist in going back to work after being off for extended periods of time you should talk to your local social services office.

secretsanta,epndbkm,t3_bv8lhc,1559325606.0,Please Santa's dont just hit ship to meet the deadline do it when you actually ship you're gift. Communication if you are shipping late is better than just making it appear to be shipped.
