As far as interview questions go, try to answer with a problem, what you did to resolve it and the outcome. This needs to be a career choice, not a job. You're either all in or you might as well not even bother. Learn what an electrician does on a job. Be aware of your working conditions, they'll ask what you think an electrician does.

That's a quick some up. Let me know if you have any questions"

PS5,fr1k4bo,t3_gm498h,1589821109.0,Yea I noticed it too. The psvr and dual sense are very similar. I have no doubt the Ps5 console will follow with a black base and white plates

PS5,fqy34od,t3_glg2yw,1589741820.0,I haven't enjoyed AC in years but I decided to pick up Odyssey and am really enjoying it. Origins and Odyssey turned the series around IMO and I'll be picking up Valhalla for Ps5
PS5,fqy2z2n,t1_fqy1m1v,1589741748.0,Depends on the game. Likely not with new AAA games giving us the best graphics possible. Ue5 demo was 1440p upscaled

I feel like turn based RPGs are out the door at this point. Ff7 remake made it modern and games like Persona are the last to stand on that leg. Wild Arms was pretty cool but it needs a modern day overhaul"

As for the Xbox guys well. They just don't see how far Xbox has fallen since the rise in the beginning. Xbox One was terrible, no new IPs that really sucked you in. Even the mainstay Xbox games Halo and Gears of War haven't been very great. But XsX has most power lol!

It's all good. I love Sony and they keep killing it so I'm happy"
PS5,fqqcayz,t1_fqq9zpn,1589563054.0,Cyberpunk is a definite Ps5 game for me. But that's because it also comes out closer to Ps5 launch. If Last of us 2 or GoT came out around Ps5 launch I'd hold off. Assuming they'll be on Ps5

PS5,fqojixi,t3_gk14do,1589516696.0,"At launch? Doubt it, but who cares?

Some of the best games graphics wise (U4, God of War, Horizon) didn't come out until years later. It's a tech demo and using the Ps5 to showcase it was very impressive by itself.

The PS4 managed to have games that looked BETTER than the UE4 demo. If anything we can look forward to games that'll blow our minds even farther than the UE5 demo."

brooklynninenine,fqc53dy,t3_ghkiab,1589250298.0,"The first two seasons aren't the greatest imo. They didn't develop the characters until about halfway through season 1 and some of them are very different. Boyle, Holt, Jake and especially Rosa develop into much better characters.

Season 2 had some fun episodes and you kinda catch a glimpse of what makes the show really shine but it's not quite there yet. 

IMO season 3 is when things really start to shine. The characters are now developed and the episodes start to have a flow instead of mostly being one offs. Great guest characters also start coming along.

Stick with it, great things are coming!
