BDSMAdvice,for0uon,t3_g8ov3n,1588004226.0,"I was in a situation where I was abused in the community as well... it honestly took me about 3/4 years to feel comfortable enough to get back into the community. And only did so Bc I just happened to be dating a Dom..I feel as though you need to have a vetting process and look for both positive and negative characteristics in each Dom you willing to consider. 

It may also be worthwhile to get on Fetlife and find a good mentor/protector who can help you feel more comfortable within the community and assist you in the vetting process or even introduce you to someone they think highly of. It would be a good idea to find a mentor somewhere close to where you live."

BDSMAdvice,foqyuok,t3_g905yo,1588003222.0,"To me this sounds like a form is depression. And this is something I also experience if my partner has to address that I‚Äôm doing something wrong. I feel like a huge pile of shit for awhile. I absolutely hate the feeling of doing something wrong that displeases Him. But I think this is a natural feeling as someone who plays an important role within any relationship. This could also have something to do with quarantine, it‚Äôs really taking a toll on people‚Äôs mental health."
BDSMAdvice,foprwcm,t1_fopr9n9,1587970145.0,Where is the karma? üòÖ I found it XD THANK YOU!!
BDSMcommunity,foprlsh,t1_fopqgcm,1587969880.0,"Everyone is entitled to some form of care if they choose to engage in this type of play though. That can look VERY different for people though. Sometimes it‚Äôs simply getting your partner a glass of water and asking them ‚Äúhey, are you ok?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúHey, I hope you made it home safe.‚Äù Aftercare is mainly about checking in with your partner. And if you aren‚Äôt communicating with them then something is wrong. Even just talking about your session could be considered aftercare. So it‚Äôs very understandable that people jump ship when they hear ‚Äúno aftercare‚Äù Bc that implies your not receiving some form of care."
BDSMAdvice,fopqsmt,t1_foppdbz,1587969159.0,Ok maybe I was quick to jump on that. For some reason I can‚Äôt see all the responses in the thread including mine. But I could just now when someone responded to my response. Idk what‚Äôs up with that. I thought they deleted me I was pissed lol
BDSMcommunity,fopqhqc,t1_fopovfe,1587968894.0,Although it‚Äôs my personal opinion to always provide aftercare depending on the status of your relationship with your play partner. Perhaps I should have been more clear.
BDSMcommunity,fopq863,t1_fopovfe,1587968656.0,"I didn‚Äôt say this person was in the wrong. I said they need to have a discussion and negotiate more about their dynamic and what their needs/wants are. Not everyone needs or wants aftercare. But in this case she wants aftercare this being said I feel as though it‚Äôs a right she deserves. There is a massive difference between partners who choose to do aftercare separately. AKA self care. It‚Äôs morally wrong to walk away from someone after a session who wants and feels as if they need aftercare. Although in this case she did say she hadn‚Äôt asked for it. Which is why there needs to be a conversation that takes place. Which to be fair this conversation should have taken place before either of them engaged in play. But this could be from a lack of experience or knowledge, which is ok, thats why we learn from experiences and better ourselves."
BDSMAdvice,fopot9e,t1_fopokal,1587967448.0,Pissed me the hell off! Granted it was in response to two people the original creator of the thread and someone who insulted a Dom. I simply stated why said rule was important and why it‚Äôs in place. And then went on to question the owner of the thread about her choices that were questionable as far as her topping from the bottom in a way. So...
BDSMcommunity,fopkap1,t1_fopjx9q,1587963757.0,"I disagree with that. Most ALL people who are in the BDSM community that have taken the time to educate themselves know that aftercare is ALWAYS given. It sounds like to me you haven‚Äôt completely negotiated your dynamic and still have things to discuss. Aftercare is very important and should never be overlooked. Some people who have just play partners choose to do aftercare separately but it‚Äôs still there. I personally feel like if your in a loving, healthy BDSM relationship aftercare is very important and should never be overlooked! Again! And this could even be said for a vanilla relationship tbh."
BDSMcommunity,fopjtck,t1_fop7obi,1587963381.0,Run away. And don‚Äôt look back. Aftercare is a right not a privilege. Although if you have had a discussion with you Dom/play partner that you do aftercare separately then that‚Äôs different.
BDSMcommunity,fopjmno,t3_g8q84c,1587963234.0,"Aftercare is somewhat intertwined while a scene is on going for me. This looks like my Dom using me while also checking in with me that I‚Äôm ok or after heavy impact he will kiss me and tell me that he loves me, then offers if I would like some water. After all of that, it‚Äôs usually lots of kisses and cuddles. I really enjoy taking a bath or shower afterwards. My Dom will wash me and I‚Äôll wash him. Sometimes we will order a pizza and find a good movie to watch together. We change it up occasionally by showering and then going for a walk together."
BDSMAdvice,fopfou7,t1_fop8209,1587960294.0,"As previously stated being in a D/s relationship dynamic is not role play. It would be considered role play if you are only using BDSM within the bedroom and do not life the lifestyle. For many, including myself this is a way of life. I too have the rule that I‚Äôm not supposed to masturbate without permission, although my Dom did place a rule that follows along with it that if I do not have the ability to ask Him then, Yes I can masturbate if I choose to do so. But I must tell Him that I did immediately. 

This rule isn‚Äôt just there to say ‚Äòoh well you can‚Äôt touch yourself because I said so.‚Äô This rule is put in place because you are consentingly giving up control to your Dominant therefore He has the authority to place sexual rules and restrictions. I believe this is actually a VERY COMMON rule that most subs are given. My Dom gave me this rule specifically because I squirt. And if I go days or weeks without squirting and then have sex with Him, I‚Äôll have an extremely intense orgasm and squirt buckets at the same time. That‚Äôs my reward for following my rules. 

As for the above statement, if it is not stated in your dynamic to break rules to seek punishment- then A.) Are you actually giving up control and trusting your Dominants authority? B.) Are you doing this to gain His approval for punishment or topping from the bottom? Secretly. C.) Why not just ask your Dominant to punish you because that‚Äôs what you seek? 

I look at this in two ways.

1.) you might have the mentality of a Brat which is great and all but everything should be negotiated. To break a rule your Dominant places (no matter if it‚Äôs something you deem as small or insignificant/ He won‚Äôt ACTUALLY be angry about) is disrespectful towards your Dom. This in turn may make Him question if you actually trust Him and His authority. And may make Him feel as if He cannot trust you...

2.) If your doing this just to do it and you don‚Äôt actually want to follow this rule then perhaps you don‚Äôt need to be in the lifestyle because you are displaying Pseudo-sub behavior. Because in this case you are undermining the dynamic that YOU and your Dom have put in place. Perhaps you can learn from this mistake and correct yourself."

witchcraft,fokoa3b,t3_g7v2yd,1587845813.0,"There is a lot you can do with witchcraft in your situation. Although I suggest being very careful around this parent. Do not leave any trace of anything they would deem witchcraft Bc this could only lead to more harm being done to you. I would suggest doing a black candle binding spell on your mother. I‚Äôm Wiccan so I wouldn‚Äôt ever cause her harm (not that she doesn‚Äôt deserve it in this case) Come up with your own spell but I think a good idea is to take a picture of your Mom and write something along the line of ‚Äúyou can do no more harm etc‚Äù on the back of it. You can also create or put a sigil of said statement on there as well as protective ones around it. Fold it up so that sigils and writing are outward. (I‚Äôm not a hex type of person but... I would throw in some rose thorns in hope that it will bite her in the ass) seal it all up together with the black wax from the candle and take black string and wrap it up completely. And when I say completely I mean to where you cannot see any of the white on the back. While do that be thinking strongly of your intentions. You could also come up with a incantation first this part. 

I also suggest you do a little more research before hand some of the topic of Hex‚Äôs, black candle spells, protection and binding spells, sigils/how to charge your sigils.

Always remember Hexs can come back to you in threefold. So take or leave the thorns. That‚Äôs up to you. 

Lastly I‚Äôm very sorry to hear that this has happened to you. I had a similar background although I was never in foster care. When you are bit older maybe consider talking to a therapist. I wish I had went to one sooner Bc my background led to me getting into lots of trouble. My therapist and mentors have really helped me. Stay strong lovely. You‚Äôll be in my prayers ‚ù§Ô∏è"

mentalhealth,fmo3kvb,t1_fmo32qw,1586244116.0,"What might look like someone functioning just fine on the outside is not what is happening on the inside. She has Anxiety, PTSD, and Depression. Anxiety and PTSD already make your head swim w too much shit racing through your mind that you cannot make it slow down. (On tip of that this pandemic is incredibly terrifying) That‚Äôs why the medication she is on is a sedative."
mentalhealth,fmo32qw,t3_fwdz9d,1586243598.0,"You must have no idea what it‚Äôs like to be heavily medicated. If you‚Äôre that medicated your only capable of so much. It‚Äôs not a switch you can turn off. You eat, you sleep, do something to stimulate yourself. I couldn‚Äôt even read a book for months Bc I was medicated that A. I became temporarily dyslexic and B it gave me a massive headache even trying to focus on words. I‚Äôm on just meditation for anxiety atm but even that is a sedative. It makes you tired, have a headache, can even cause stomach pain, and make your eyes not focus well. Sometimes a screen is the easiest thing to look at Bc it‚Äôs flat and tends to consistent. 

On top of this! Your being an asshole to her because shes only mentally capable of doing one thing atm. A the world has gone to shit with CV19 B Your not being understanding or a least trying to be sympathetic/empathetic C She is already suffering apart from CV19 pandemic (which is incredibly stressful for someone who suffers from anxiety already) and you being annoyed at her in the slightest will only make her mind retreat back to her comfort zone. And that‚Äôs the computer atm. Of course she‚Äôs gonna stay there Bc that‚Äôs the only place she feels safe! 

Be kinder, make an effort to go out of your way to ask her what she needs. MAKE HER FEEL COMFORTABLE AND AT HOME. MAKE HER FEEL SAFE. You have no idea what it‚Äôs like to suffer with all that. And then have someone not understand and be unkind to you because of what your going through. Being kind and understanding goes a long way. Once your kinder to her, she will come out of her shell. Make your needs be know too, I‚Äôm sure you need help cleaning the house. Ask her kindly if she could help you. And don‚Äôt be rude about it, be positive and uplifting. It goes along way. 

And tbh she might not be able to help you with much right now because she is so heavily medicated. That medication sedates you, you don‚Äôt feel anything at all. I was hospitalized because I took LSD and it forced me into psychosis for over a month. Once I came out of it I was so sedated for months because of the medication I was on. I couldn‚Äôt feel anything and I couldn‚Äôt do anything besides extremely simple tasks. 

Please be kinder. Your only making her hurt and struggle even more than she already is by being unkind and rude. If you can‚Äôt say anything nice don‚Äôt say anything at all. And when you do think before you speak."

Rn I would really think about what you want and what you know makes you happy. And if you don‚Äôt know pick up some hobbies you can do at home. Make a routine for yourself to do everyday. I really struggle with routine so you could start out with something simple as getting up at a certain time, making your bed, stretch, and read something or make yourself watch a movie you know you‚Äôll enjoy. Little things. Rn getting therapy and doctors etc is difficult Bc of CV19. I struggle with PTSD, Anxiety, and depression. It‚Äôs a constant struggle. I would make time to see even just a regular doctor who can put in the right direction. Mine prescribed be Buspirone it‚Äôs mild anti-anxiety medication. But it has even helped me in other areas as well. I would even look into non profit mental health organizations around you that do treatment. That‚Äôs where I started. Unfortunately no one will help us if we aren‚Äôt willing to help ourselves. No one can force us to be better than ourselves and even then it‚Äôs a struggle. Take it one day at a time. Set small goals for yourself like doing just one or two things everyday, look into therapists and even just a regular doctor. Make self care your priority."

We would be negotiating certain areas within my life and our relationship that he would have control and final say over.

birthcontrol,flw6e68,t3_frisc4,1585540879.0,In my experience if you become anxious about your period it will delay even more. Are you on any form of birth control?

Anxiety and stress (even if you think your not THAT stressed out) can cause it become late. I didn‚Äôt have a period for two months Bc I was so stressed out about not having one.

I‚Äôm glad she reached out. It‚Äôs not often enough that we reach out for people when we need them. And it‚Äôs hard to come to the decision that we need it. Kind words and love is so important for mental health."

witchcraft,fdhp2h4,t1_fdg5efy,1578427318.0,Not specifically but it does encompass it
witchcraft,fde77y4,t1_fde69q9,1578332699.0,And if you don‚Äôt have a witchy tumblr you should make one. There are a lot of good resources on tumblr but always do your own research too Bc not all of it is always accurate
witchcraft,fde7438,t1_fde69q9,1578332632.0,Try Wicca by Scott Cunningham it‚Äôs good place to start.
witchcraft,fde630c,t3_ekx7tu,1578331987.0,I read part of wiccapedia and felt that it‚Äôs definitely a different kind of Wicca. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs great beginner look Bc it is specific to angelic Wicca. But I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a bad book I think it‚Äôs just important to take what applies to you!
Wicca,fde51dx,t3_ekv2jb,1578331334.0,"I like to do the traditional method of writing a direct statement. So direct in way that when written it‚Äôs as if your desire has already happened. You claim your desire with your statement. Then cross out all the repeated consonants and all your vowels. Sometimes I keep letters that seem important to each word. With the letters that are left I shape them together and form a sigil. I connect them. Say you have W, Y, V I can flip letters around and attach them together instead of writing every letter out. Look for the negative space between letters"

cats,fd6i5bk,t1_fd6hvt5,1578191393.0,There is an online way to register your pet so they are in a USA database with paperwork? I have a therapist but he can‚Äôt diagnose me? But has suggested I have a psychological evaluation done to determine my diagnosis. He told me he couldn‚Äôt help me with my pet.
cats,fd6gzfw,t3_ek6iz2,1578190869.0,I‚Äôm moving and have come to realize that I need my Cat to be registered as an ESA. I really would like to know what the process is like. When I read about it online it seems overwhelming in a way and I‚Äôm not sure what certification I need to choose.

Wicca,fabrtmk,t3_e7p3b6,1575927757.0,"This is going to sound really strange but I felt my grandfathers spirit around me last night. It was strange when I felt him beside me it was like everything around me tightened and felt smaller. I think it made me feel anxious at first and then it felt like someone just touched my leg not physically but I felt warmth above my knee- then all my anxiety faded. In that moment I knew it was him. And sadly  I‚Äôm terrified of spirits, it‚Äôs an irrational fear of mine. I hope maybe one day to move past it. I did his memorial in the hope that he can move into his next life and transform into a new person. A better person from this life. This afternoon I buried the herbs and picture of him under a Christmas tree growing in the front yard."
Wicca,fa9iev5,t3_e8385e,1575874943.0,There is no right or wrong way to practice Wicca or any form of paganism. That‚Äôs the joy of Wicca there are no rules although most follow do not harm do as you will- this includes inflicting pain again yourself or anyone else. Look up some books from your local books a million or Barnes and Nobe. Scott Cunningham is a good place to start.
