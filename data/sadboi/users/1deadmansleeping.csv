dating_advice,fombd7j,t1_fomahwm,1587884062.0,Thanks. This answer feels right. It's what I was thinking deep down but wasn't quite sure of. Thanks for the precise advice.
depression,fom64xc,t3_g86zw8,1587879427.0,Really? It makes me happy to see other depressed losers out there. Makes me feel like I'm not alone.
dating_advice,fom5fbt,t1_fom5dmk,1587878839.0,Hello how r ya
infp,fom4wmp,t3_g7w1qj,1587878413.0,That's just because I hate people and eventually after getting to know people I discover the same negative traits in them that most people have.
dating_advice,fom4als,t1_fom41ku,1587877922.0,She likes him. Not sure what kind of fan she is though.
AskMen,fom1e9x,t1_fom0so3,1587875684.0,Well then there are some misleading websites that say that you can get dating advice from r/AskMen.
AskMen,fom1521,t1_fom0ros,1587875496.0,Well those are all good questions.
AskFDS,fkgt1jx,t1_fkgqmjr,1584172894.0,The only thing women discuss when they are alone is men. Women are quite interested in what they want from men right now. History is quite irrelevant to them.
FemaleDatingStrategy,fkgi6en,t3_fh9uku,1584160512.0,"""ALL MALE REDDITORS WILL BE BANNED"" on here and ""ALL ABUSIVE COMMENTS WILL BE REMOVED."" Yet this whole subreddit is an echo chamber of angry man hating women and none of those posts have been removed. It's so contradictory the policy of deleting all male redditors violates the subreddits own policy. My question would be, how are you women so complicated and full of double standards?"
FemaleDatingStrategy,fkghqrh,t1_fkai0tv,1584160118.0,"""They hate strong women."" No. We love strong women. Strong women don't lose their shit over a question and strong women can handle different opinions. 

Most of y'all ain't strong. Y'all constantly shift blame, don't take responsibility for anything, act entitled to everything on here, generalize, then on the AskFDS subreddit your answers are basically attacking the guy for asking the question. One of the policies is that the guy who asked the question can't argue with the advice even if it's bad advice which it usually is. Your female moderation deletes questions and comments from men that that they don't like because they're such ""strong women"" that they're afraid of discussing it. 

Y'all ain't strong if you're afraid of what some guys are gonna say. Y'all come accross as scared shitless. Honestly I've never seen weeker human beings than on this subreddit scared of everything a man does."

raisedbynarcissists,eznimiz,t3_d0royb,1568006500.0,My dad had me to mirror his failures. So he imposes his shortcomings onto me and im also suppose to work to please him. He also plays favorites so my other siblings dont relate to me. I'm basically just a worthless pos.
depression,ezl76ym,t3_d1aqew,1567973056.0,I wanna die too. I don't think anyone would understand why tho. And my mom is the one who cares about me the most. Lol
depression,eyvbw3z,t3_cz0ego,1567487670.0,"That's exactly right. I feel the same way. I'd say find a job that is easy and pays well but also find a skill or a gift that you have and develop it, whether it be drawing, painting, crafting, writing, working with electronics, ...etc. It's better than working for a business that doesn't give a fuck about you."
cats,eyp3hth,t3_cy1cdc,1567289200.0,Unfortunately idont think i have any pictures of tiger. I was really young and didn't have a phone. For some reason i was trying to send a picture of my dog XD

depression,eyfys68,t3_cww57w,1567057785.0,Sounds like you've got existential depression. You don't see a point in living right?
depression,eyfxwat,t3_cwv7n4,1567057279.0,"I feel the same, that no one really likes me.
I think what it is is that everyone has their group and they do not like outsiders. You being the new person each time, that immediately makes you the intruder in their eyes, until maybe you stay long enough for them to warm up to you, but then you might have a stigma and you don't like them because you've been pushed away so many times so you begin to distance yourself from them... Ig that's my diagnosis."
depression,eyfqsps,t1_eyfql3d,1567053301.0,Ok. Think of me as your own personal therapist.
