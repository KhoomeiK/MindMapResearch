bipolar,feziev8,t3_eqziii,1579457669.0,"I'm super stressed taking this class. This was for our first assignment and I had a lot of energy and good feelings about it. Now that it is done I don't know what to do for my second assignment. 

I don't really have anyone to talk to about my art so Im going to vent here.

I have been drawing circles for the past year. Other things as well, but lots of circles. Nothing digital. Paints and pens. Also squares. 

I had single celled organisms on my mind so went that direction with it. It reminded me of a movie called baraka that juxtaposed nature and the human world. 

For my second project I'm trying to show a juxtaposition but I'm not sure of what. I keep falling into a choice paralysis pit."

bipolar2,f9n8kdp,t3_e626hy,1575479314.0,I am a man who is here. I find that I struggle with many of the topics you describe. I have therapy today and have found it to be a mixed bag. I hope you find the patience to hear out those around you. It can be really hard at times but even imperfect advice can be useful. You are stronger than you realize. Part of that strength is opening up and speaking about your emotional experiences. It's difficult but worth it.

Filmmakers,f8vtc4r,t3_e2j6x4,1574876867.0,It's really hard. Part of being on set is making connections and establishing good working relationships with the people around you. It is how you get the next job more often than not. I got very lucky my first few years. I worked under one person so I wasn't having to bid and secure the jobs.

When you close your eyes, anything you can picture is as real to your mind as the physical space around you when you open them. 

Spending too much time in the past or in the future with your ruminations will not lead to new discoveries. Only further sadness and dispair. I feel you. I am having a bad week myself. Things always change. Patience and empathy for your process of change is key."

I am still super scared when I put myself out there creatively. I usually just want to connect with people on an emotional level now rather than noteriety. That makes it easier for me to reach out a bit further."
bipolar,f7hotr6,t3_dw5gkn,1573744785.0,I've been thinking of some similar imagery. I recently found out about the six basic emotional expressions and have been doing drawings of them. I want to paint them onto butterfly wings but I keep distracting myself. I like your drawing.

That sinus problem sounds lame. I'm sorry you are uncomfortable. 

I've never called a crisis line before. that is very brave of you. 

Do you have a plan for your weekend to keep you distracted when your emotions overwhelm you? I have been putting a list of films I like to watch when I'm sad. I'm going to watch royal tennenbaums today.

I've also found instrumental music like Brian eno's album Thursday Afternoon to be be very peaceful to listen to. I have a list of music I like as well. I need to make a better system but it's a start. 

I hope you have a forgiving weekend. :)"

bipolar,f48n19o,t3_djv0s2,1571443252.0,"Hey, I don't have a success story but this is my year.

This year started out as the lowest point of my life. I have made a lot of art this year. I've learned new methods of creating. I took two classes with real people in one of the two classes. One class, everyone but me dropped. 

I don't have a job and haven't this entire year but I've been thinking about creative volunteer work or working for someone who loves to make something. I just want to be around some genuine positivity.

I feel like that is what I am miss most right now. It's hard to find sincerity when I constantly push others away. Yet I am understanding now more than ever about how to set boundaries. 

I have been used by many people over the years and have used many people because of my fears, depressions, and anxieties. I am trying to live a more honest and open life.

I hope you find the same strength you've carried with you with thus far as you continue your journey into the unknown. I believe in you."
