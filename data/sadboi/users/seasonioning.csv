It's better to not know at all, but here's the link. The url gives it away, but know that you'll regret knowing anything other than the title."
Philippines,fi0j3fm,t3_f4y5ld,1582038154.0,"Where to buy cargo pants and combat boots in Mandaluyong / Pasig? Nakakapunta ako sa Robinson's Galleria at Megamall, pero 'di ko alam yung mga store dun.

Nagdududa talaga kasi ako kung mag-oorder sa Shopee, Lazada, or kung ano man. Thanks in advance."
Philippines,fi0hs1d,t1_fhzybxo,1582037285.0,"'Di ko binasa nang maayos yung El Fili, pero pwede ata (ata) kahit anong itsura. Not sure, pero wala atang tiyak na itsura yung mga tauhan, maliban lang sa vague na pang-uri tulad ng 'maganda', etc. Yung iba't-ibang aklat may sari-sariling interpretasyon sa itsura nila.

Yung libro namin dati - kung sinong staff member lang yung pinicturan. Pina-drawing rin ako dati ng mga tauhan at kung ano lang yung ginawa ko; 'di naman ako pinagalitan ng teacher namin."
Philippines,fi0grve,t1_fi05e83,1582036611.0,"I second u/vardonir's comment. Pwede gumawa ng notebook gamit bondpaper or mag-drawing nalang sa likod ng scratch paper; ganun yung ginagawa ko paminsan, haha.

Sa Daiso maaring may makita kang blank notebook na 88 pesos lang, pero yung stock between branches 'di consistent.

Sa Shopee pwede kang gumamit ng free shipping voucher(?) o magpasabay ka nalang sa kaibigan mong mag-oorder ng Shopee."
DoesAnybodyElse,fhzuqi2,t3_f5kbjz,1582012630.0,I'm not even 20 but my brain and knees are shit. I used to have a professsional-level English vocabulary but now I struggle to spell words like 'occassion'. I repeat questions I already asked three minutes ago because I forget that I asked before.

lonely,fh86lef,t3_f1cdx4,1581353161.0,"This post and a lot of the comments are too relatable. I've never had a friendship that's lasted, plus I'm awful at staying in touch. I'm currently dredging through life without any friends at all."
lonely,fh81wni,t3_f1r194,1581350185.0,"I don't know if it'll console you much, but know that you aren't alone in that. I remember one time, I was embarrassed by my teacher in front of the whole classroom for something similar.

Personally, I'd just pray for it to be one of those moments that people would forget about. I hope you'll eventually find people that will call you their friend, OP."
lonely,fh7ie8s,t3_f1n6ff,1581333377.0,"A lot. When I can't distract myself with reading, a game, or whatever, that's what I do."
exIglesiaNiCristo,fh2j6c0,t3_f0pfwv,1581254730.0,"There's thing about how the original Bible didn't actually denounce homosexuality - how the Bible versions today are greatly modified from the original, with its own removals, additions, etc. Along with how some things from the original Bible were mistranslated or had no direct equivalent in the translated language. Sources exist, but I have none readily available at my disposal.

Being LGBT isn't abnormal or unnatural. Humanity has always had LGBT people. Ancient Greece had many LGBT people, such as the famous poet Sappho. Ancient China had bisexual rulers. Many famous Renessaince artists are rumored to be or very obviously gay.

Either way, its awful to see people treat others inhumanly just for their sexuality. They don't even understand what or how it is, and they just resort to outdates stereotypes. I'm LGBT myself, but I will never tell any devout INC members about that.

Find yourself a support group, and if you can, avoid contact with people who would just antagonize you for who you are. Stay strong and best of luck to you."
depression,fgl4sn9,t3_ez2tk6,1580882025.0,Same. I think about that almost constantly.
lonely,fgi7dyr,t3_eymfjt,1580809454.0,Happy Birthday!
exIglesiaNiCristo,ffvypop,t3_evdzor,1580277482.0,"This looks like a cult propaganda video from a movie or show. It's eerie and it's obvious that they're telling the children what to do - blatantly forced smiles, mirrored movements, and all.

I can't wait to get out of the INC."
lonely,ffvxsci,t3_evdewo,1580276579.0,"Strange. I just came home, planning on drinking, crying, and listening to sad music. This is one of the first posts I see when I open up Reddit.

Cheers."
depression,ff9byxt,t3_es7e5j,1579709491.0,"What's in Bojack is really specific sometimes, and it's strange how still relatable it is. Like the 'You inherit your parent's trauma', self-destruction, and the near-constant thoughts of self-hatred. Sometimes I had to pause the show and process it - partly because I had empathy for Bojack, and mostly because it also applied to me."
vtmb,ff8kfj8,t3_ervc7f,1579682728.0,"Colt Anaconda (fan mode). I loved the feel of it when you used it; graceful.

My first playthrough was a gunslinger Toreador with high Celerity, so combat was very Matrix-esque. I especially loved shooting my way out of the club in Chinatown."
vtmb,ff8k2my,t3_es183g,1579682202.0,he's a dumpster fire and i feel like i should hate him the same way nines does but i can't; i love to hate him
lonely,ff888ob,t3_es5iv4,1579668847.0,"Oof I do that from time to time. I think up scenarios where I'm hanging out and having fun with all my imaginary friends. Sometimes I imagine really tender and sweet moments with an imaginary partner, like slow dancing or watching a movie at 2am together."
lonely,ff5a2hh,t3_er8v82,1579584822.0,yes. i've learned to cope somewhat but it still hurts to not have any real connections with other people
lonely,ff58xng,t3_erm6kx,1579583771.0,"I'm bothered by being lonely, but I usually repress the feeling away. But when someone points it out or acknowledges it in any way, I feel extremely embarrassed."

lonely,f7tszh2,t3_dx78ji,1574007392.0,"I feel you. Whether in public or by myself, I remember that I don't have anybody. It hurts physically and I feel like I'm going to vomit.

Posting on subreddits and venting helps me, personally. Well wishes to you."
lonely,f4q3pim,t3_dkt1ct,1571747491.0,Same. I save it to my phone so my future self can enjoy it.
depression,f4pxl4c,t3_dle86h,1571744620.0,"Yeah. During the day, I usually just feel numb or something. Around 2am though, I start involuntarily crying."
depression,f4ptvap,t3_dl8sp5,1571742758.0,"Yeah. I remember being inquisitive as a child. Now, my mind feels stuffy and clogged all the time and I'm barely able to form any coherent thoughts."
depression,f4pt4z7,t3_dlfw2v,1571742287.0,Me too; I'm just letting time pass. Nobody needs me and I don't have any drive. There's just no easily accessible way for me to painlessly off myself.
lonely,f3eavfa,t3_dgj5tu,1570866296.0,"I feel this too. I avoid social media because it reminds me of how other people go out with their friends wherever to make memories and have fun. On weekends, I just busy myself with whatever until Monday comes.

On Friday nights and weekends, try to do something. Even if you're alone, it'll make weekends feel better. Like going out to places you've never been before, watching a movie, or eating out."
socialskills,f3auzsq,t3_dg36ez,1570792670.0,"I don't know her temperament / how she reacts to certain things, but regardless of whether or not she's doing it as a joke, tell her that it makes you uncomfortable and that you want her to stop. It's undeniably strange that this girl who you've never even seen before decides that you're in a relationship. It's understandable why you don't want this continue."

lonely,f32ogio,t1_f2oju5h,1570620426.0,"I don't know if it's Reddit taboo to reply to comments that are days old, but y'know.

My hygiene is good, I believe. I even put on perfume sometimes (but I don't smell bad if I don't). I don't go anywhere without showering (soap and shampoo included), and I can't stand having stains on my clothes or body."
depression,f2k8ikh,t3_ddbl8n,1570282559.0,"I feel the same. I rarely, if ever, tell my anyone about my life because I feel like I'm just burdening them. They all have their own lives without me. Nobody at all initiates conversation with me and I feel like I'm barely just a passing thought to anyone everyday."
