castiron,fqlr0u2,t1_fnt42hj,1589464414.0,"2 cups wild yeast (google sour dough starter)
2 1/3 cup warm water
2 tsp salt

Mix until foamy

4 cups untreated hard flour...mix in 1/2 cup at a time

Dough should be very sticky

Let autolyse (sit) for an hour

Lightly oil hands and take some dough and try to pull upwards gently. If it wont pull, add small bits of flour until it is very sticky but you can pull it. Pull and fold like an envelope three tumes around the bowl. Texture will change slightly.

Pull and fold every half hour for 2 hours (five times all together)

By this time dough should be smooth and elastic

Cover and put in fridge overnight

In the morning take dough from fridge. Heat oven and cast iron dutch oven to 450. Be really careful not to burn yourself. When oven is ready take out cast iron. Sprinkle sesame seeds on dough and carefully turn dough over and dump in pot. You can carefully do a wee shaping. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top and make 3,  2 inch long half inch deep slits on top. I use small sharp scissors. Put lid back on....dont forget its hot...and bake at 450 for about 40 mins. When brwad has risen and is golden take lid off and bake for another half hour or until bread is a lovely dark amber colour

Take out of oven and cool for an hour before slicing"

AskDocs,fjihs5w,t3_fdmmjk,1583367919.0,Cant say for sure of course and NAD. But it sure sounds like flu to me. Keep treating symptoms and if you're worse instead of better tomorrow or your chest starts hurting a lot when you cough go back to the doc.
AmItheAsshole,fjgfna4,t3_fdc4ox,1583325122.0,I've had lots of cats and not one needed to be litter trained. List show him a couple of times where the box is. YTA though. Why get a cat when you can never be there for him

unpopularopinion,fjf2thr,t3_fd42fg,1583283098.0,"Pitbulls used to be called the nanny dogs before they were inbred for aggressiveness for assholes who fought them. People used them to watch over their kids. This was back early last century. Most pitties are big babies. It really sucks when someone gets stuck with one of the inbred ones. Also...you do know pit bull is not an actual breed dont you? There's a few dogs that fall into the pit bull category. Providing I know the family tree of a pit bull, I would have absolutely no fear. We have one in our family.and hes a lot more trustworthy with other people than our mini pin. But i love the mini pin in spite of how ferocious he is."
unpopularopinion,fjf18re,t3_fd459j,1583282145.0,I use mine everyday. Try the Amy and Jacky instant pot recipes. I use mainly those. Try the butter chicken one. It's easy and delicious and I dont see how you could go wrong. It might change your mind
