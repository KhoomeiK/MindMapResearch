mentalhealth,ew0rejp,t3_cm8d84,1565003099.0,I‚Äôm going through the same exact thing. Every single detail. Don‚Äôt worry about being judged on here! This community will help you through it.. you are accepted and appreciated. I don‚Äôt have the motivation or energy to do much. I‚Äôve always been depressed and never social. My friend just thinks I‚Äôm lazy but I‚Äôd rather let her think that than let her know how sad I am. I also am unable to finish homework and shit it‚Äôs so stressful idk how to deal with it. I did research and I possibly have ADHD but I don‚Äôt want to self diagnose. For me it‚Äôs possibly ADHD but I have mistaken it for being lazy or procrastination. Just wanted to let you know that you are not going through it alone and I relate to your situation rn. Feel free to private message me. No pressure. Im here to talk whenever. This is a safe place.
