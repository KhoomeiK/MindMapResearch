There are aspects that a South African accent has that aren’t necessarily also Afrikaans sounding.

I find it a bit small though so I only use it when the mood strikes me, but it’s a bit larger than the G Pro wired (by a fraction) from what Ive read on here, and really light if you use it with a single lithium ion battery.

Alternatively if you don’t mind a larger mouse more suited to your hand size, the FK1+ is a good suggestion and I use it with a loose claw grip without issue. It’s a bit heavier than I’d like but I still think it’s a great mouse. That’s probably your best consideration based on your actual hand size.

Finally, if you’re really feeling adventurous, I’d suggest the Intellimouse Pro. I used to use it with claw but it’s also good for fingertip, and it’s great for larger hands. It is quite heavy tho (but it doesn’t feel as heavy as most other mice over 100g)."

As such I’ve mostly moved over to JS, just to get a new perspective and due to how different is, particularly with React.

It does take a bit of time before the motivation comes back though, as you can’t help but subconsciously assume other languages and stacks are the same as the one you’ve been working on, but in reality there are lots of alternative ways to do things, and if feels like you actually have to think things through again as opposed to being so used to your way of doing things that it’s just this long list of mundane tasks you have to perform for each project."

buildapc,fkgw0f7,t3_fiap19,1584177066.0,"I would suggest watching a large number of relatively recent PC building tutorials on YouTube, so you understand the general structure and process, and glean certain concepts from the builders as they explain what they’re doing and why they’re doing it, or why they chose parts. It’ll also make it less daunting seeing how simple the process can be.

Then I’d look at recent builds on pcpartpicker, and determine if it’s in your budget and do some research on the parts they used (like CPU benchmarks, and their price to performance ratios), and then after that, put a build together and ask for advice like you have here. This will take some iteration and learning, so don’t take it too seriously if you battle to do this in a day. Make sure to research every single part you plan to use as, for example, the GPU could be too large for the case you bought, or the cooler may not have a bracket for your CPU (if not a stock cooler that came with the CPU). Or the RAM may not be ideal for your particular motherboard or CPU compatibility-wise (less of a possibility now than in the Ryzen 2xxx and 1xxx days). On that note, if you do get Ryzen, stick with the 3xxx range to reduce the chance of the aforementioned being an issue.

You will have to do a lot of research, but if you’re excited about it it should feel fun and rewarding. Keep in mind that building a PC is quite a simple process, though I would see if you can ask a friend who knows the ropes to assist you when you do get to building it, to prevent you from breaking anything by mistake as you do it. It’ll also be less intimidating that way. I’m sure your father will be okay with that, and understanding of the fact that you’re only just learning the process. As someone who doesn’t regularly build PCs, I still find that I sometimes get close to messing up building a new PC if I haven’t kept up with PC part changes for a few years, so I keep a similar YouTube build video rolling next to me on my iPad so I’m sure I’m going about things correctly, and can cross reference the part positions, sockets, and plugs.

Good luck, and most importantly, have fun!"

Big sound stage, and a warmer sound with a focus on mids and highs. But in practice I wasn't very impressed. And I don't like the way it sounds with music - it's far too warm, to the point of removing certain details from the lows and mids. It's a lot better on a beefy amp (I got a THX certified amp - the SMSL SP200 - and they sounded much better than on my tiny Fiio K3 or my K5 Pro), but I still don't like the overly warm sound. You can see an example of the difference in tone and warmth between the K702 (which is just very slightly different to the K7xx) and the HD58x here. The dude in the video says something similar - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ro9j7vGBEQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ro9j7vGBEQ).

One thing that I love about the HD660S is that the bass is quite controlled a bit on the neutral/reduced side, which also aids in not losing the more detail-oriented sounds that are usually giveaways to someone's position or movement. They're also really comfy for long sessions, say if you're doing scrims or whatever. The AKG K712s slide off over time due to the weak clamping force (I have a big head too) or when I move my head quickly for some reason. Oh, and the HD660S/58x won't be as amp-sensitive as the AKGs, so they'll run fine on most things, even onboard, though I'd recommend against that unless you have a top of the range mobo with a really good preamp.

I've not heard the AD700X, but I love my pair of ATH-R70X headphones, both for gaming and music, so if they're similarly good (not in sound signature, but in overall quality and imaging), then I'd say give em a shot.  Summit1g Loves his Audio Technicas, and I think he has the AD500X or 700X.

But that's just my personal experience hehe. I've realised I'm not the norm, also looking for good headphones for serious FPS play. I also find closed backs better for imaging precision, particularly in slower games like EoT, but I've only got a few and they're not expensive models, so I don't want to recommend any specifically, For similar reasons the IEMs do well too. But I do prefer open back for comfort and overall sound quality.

Hope it helps! Sorry if I can't give a solid ""get this model"" type answer. I'm also still trying to find the perfect gaming headphone that also sounds great for music hehe. I'm also still new to this hobby. One big lesson I've learned is that you have to learn the sound of your headphones in the same way you get used to your mouse muscle memory-wise. So changing between headphones constantly is going to make your ability to determine enemy positions way worse, as you aren't used to the signature. So give your new pair of phones a good week of play before you judge them for their gaming chops.  


Excuse the essay XD"
HeadphoneAdvice,fk6mx7b,t3_fggg8b,1583907494.0,"I like using my HD660S, and considering how reviews say it’s near identical to the 58x, I recommend that. Not a fan of using my k712 or HE4XX tho, as they both have good sound stages but I don’t find it nearly as easy to pinpoint players. 

I find that good imaging with a small-average sound stage is better as I find that lighter details don’t get lost in the background as much, as they sound a bit closer. This applies to CS GO, Apex and others. Like, say, if a footstep happens in the distance. I have a lot of background noise tho (I live next to a highway) so that could also explain my findings/preferences.

Alternatively I’ve actually found some IEMs to do an even better job, like my KZ ZS10 Pros or Ikko OH10s. They simplify things and exaggerate directionality and I think that makes it simpler to pull out little details.  But just my very subjective experience."
ZReviews,fk4i6te,t3_fgh82k,1583860943.0,"It’s not close to that price range, but the Ath-r70x is a more punchy, bassy 660S. I take them over my 660S for more fun listening that still sounds accurate."
MousepadReview,fk4hd48,t3_fg9br6,1583860479.0,I think the Mp510 is great.
HeadphoneAdvice,fk4h4rw,t3_fgci8h,1583860348.0,"KZ ZS10 Pros are awesome. They’re not particularly accurate tonally which bugged me initially, but after a week I started to love them for how smooth and engaging they were. Also super comfy."

MouseReview,fk09pte,t1_fjytmw8,1583748680.0,"As someone who finds the fk1 too small but the fk1+ perfect (for fingertip/claw) with identically sized hands, I’d say it’s worth it. It feels very different and a lot bigger. However if you’re palming it you may have issues."
