superstarsmtown,fnfyjxe,t3_g1hhfw,1586918241.0,"I play this and SSJYP. The thing that keeps me motivated is the events honestly. They give me goals to set and motivation to keep playing. The daily mission, weekly missions, and superstar league and the regular league also motivate me to log in daily. I'm only motivated enough to play them just for the goals, but not for grinding (nor did I have time for that). To keep up with more than one, perhaps spend more time on the newer game you downloaded to give it a headstart. It may be tough in the beginning since the low scores are demotivating, but perhaps the events there could motivate you to keep going. Setting goals for yourself works the best to keep you going, and the beginning is always the hardest when you have less cards."
SuperstarJYPNation,fn9f6im,t3_g0fniv,1586770616.0,"I'm assuming that they meant that you use the prizes from one mission in the Spring Picnic event to accomplish some of the objectives in another mission (or at least that's what I do). 

Automatically the prizes end up in your inbox. After I finish one mission, I instantly open up the next mission (whichever it is), then based on that I choose which prizes I need to open rather than opening them all at once before even opening the next mission. 

Yes, there is a time limit, but some people play fast enough to complete a mission before the time limit runs out, meaning that they use the pcps for the next mission within the next 6 days. 

Idk if this actually answers your question lol

EDIT: I think they mean event as in another mission, not really like another event in the next update or something."

depression,fl90js7,t1_fl905yo,1584937269.0,"Eh sometimes the things I think about are like old friendships and other things I'm involved in, which can either go good or bad in my mind. My brain just isn't willing to accept the good things that would happen (if they honestly do)."
depression,fl90g5n,t3_fndl19,1584937184.0,"It's good to let this all off your chest. I have let my feelings out to a friend, but slowly stopped over time (but if it helps you - continue to share with her!). I felt like my friendship was becoming increasingly selfish and I realized that me sharing didn't really give me relief... so sharing was all pointless anyways. 

I assure you though, if she says she'll stick with you through this, she really means it. I can't really talk about my feelings properly either. It's okay if it's hard to be open at first. It will take some time to become more open to her, so take it one step at a time, because it's tough but you are tougher!

And I've never agreed more when you said ""But something inside me just wants to ignore it and see it as just words - like I WANT to feel down in the dumps."" I truly resonate with that as well, I constantly feel like I'm just choosing to lose the battle everyday. But I wish you all the luck and love in the world! If there's some days where you don't feel like sharing with her, that's alright, don't feel forced to share with her! She'll understand you 100%."
