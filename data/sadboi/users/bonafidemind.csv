BPD,f0mf2c4,t3_d5iz67,1568743502.0,"i do this too, also hair plucking a lot. reading the comments, this is attributed to anxiety? i didn’t know that but it makes sense."
offmychest,f09wk4y,t3_d48fbm,1568507851.0,thank you so much. reading this made me really cry forreal. i appreciate this seriously so much. :(
BPD,ezxlbt2,t1_ezxe8fn,1568243303.0,"damn, I honestly don’t know what to say. this saddens me that you have had to go through this back and forth relationship with someone you truly care for. it’s hard, it’s so fucking hard, for both parties. i wish people with those traits can learn to let the people who love them, love them. and accept that love without retracting. but it requires a lot of rewiring, reconditioning, and so much more. healing is never linear. i hope this person ends up in a healthy place and i hope you receive the love you deserve."
BPD,ezxfq2p,t1_ezxf9xh,1568239331.0,"that is so relieving to read, and you seem like a genuinely kind friend. i am so glad there are people like you! i hope she appreciates you like you deserve. i *constantly* fear i am being too much for the people i love. and i fear they will distance themselves from me when they find out i'm really not okay. it's relieving to know that there are people who although cannot understand, they will always be a support system in their own way."
BPD,ezpomx2,t1_ezns27h,1568044955.0,"god damn, me too. I just went from a week of hyperactivity, hyperfocus and motivation, lack of sleep & eating, to then waking up feeling incredibly sad. crying sporadically and suicidal too.  but I just got my period and now I feel genuinely good, and it gets me in the mindset of questioning if I really do have BPD, which is not uncommon for us. ugh, a struggle!!!"

confessions,eyze4p1,t3_czjwnr,1567615671.0,"damn, this hit home. I am in the exact same position as you! I have my first therapy appointment on the 17th, and my first psychiatrist appointment next month. I know I have borderline personality disorder and I have had it for half of my life, undiagnosed and a mystery. when I realized I had BPD two months ago, it was such a huge relief --- years of questions finally had an answer. I am proud of myself for seeking help, help that I have needed for over 10 years but never got. it's a fucking struggle living with a personality disorder. it sucks so bad, but finally, I can change for the better and get the help I so desperately need. I am SO proud of you as well! good on you for taking these action steps, and remember, you are never alone."
BPD,eynl1f7,t1_eynidoa,1567251500.0,"jesus fucking christ, I am the exact way. I fall for people that show me attention, & for the most part, I wouldn’t even feel for them if they didn’t show me attention and liking in the first place. I’ll start to love too deep and it feels way to clingy for the other party. but all they wanted was a good fuck and a cool girl to hang around with. nothing more. :/"

BPD,eyc75j2,t3_cwicvj,1566997578.0,"I ask myself every one of these questions every day. you are not alone. it is a constant battle within myself questioning this and my life, and watching the people who abused me or friends or literally just anyone, continue to move on and live their lives. I’m still stuck in the past, plagued by my childhood abuse and neglect that caused me to have BPD. a constant battle, my friend. I feel you."

offmychest,ey2c44n,t1_ey24uz1,1566734384.0,"ouch! I felt this. I have feelings for the guy I am fwb with and I have since we met. I know he is fond of me but the feelings he has for me are just not there. we’re on different life paths and he can’t do relationships. so I just soak up every single moment I can spend with him — whether it just be talking, laughing, cuddling. it hurts they won’t feel the same towards you but will enjoy fucking you and being friends with you. I’m distancing myself by talking to him less but the appreciation for him still remains."
BPD,ey1l6va,t1_ey0ku1w,1566702687.0,Damn I relate to this heavy. I wish I cut off contact with my family but I still live under the same roof as them... in the same house where I was abused my entire childhood. And they question and point fingers at me as to why I am so moody or “what’s wrong with you”.
BPD,ey1l0ih,t1_ey0qg1s,1566702540.0,"Same with my brother. He says through comedy about our traumas we can move on. I can understand where he is coming from, but everyone copes and heals differently. I don’t see my uncontrollable anger and resentment towards my family because of a severe mental illness and childhood abuse, as funny. The last thing he said to me was I am a waste of space and my mental disorder is stupid. I too avoid him now... and we live under the same roof."
BPD,ey1kkz9,t3_cuwm1r,1566702174.0,"Wow, I literally just wrote a post about this, and then saw this. Although I wish I could take all your pain, frustration, and hurt away, I am glad we can be here to support one another and we truly understand how they fucked us up because of what they did. It’s not our fault, it never was. We are not to blame for what we had to suffer through. I’m so sorry you had to go through what you did."
BPD,exzgy5o,t1_exzbsul,1566665969.0,"fuck. me too dude. when I’ve done dog/cat sitting I would get soo tripped out that there’s cameras in the house that are watching me, even if they said there are no cameras. I’ll still look around and search vents and shit just to make sure. paranoia and the feeling of being watched is not fun"

damn, you are not alone. and it is weird for me to think that i am not alone either. but i too feel this way. i am 20, not in college because i have no idea what i want to pursue, still live in the same house  in the same town where i was abused my entire childhood. i don't want to be here. it is a severe trigger for my BPD, but i am not financially stable enough to move (impulsive spendings). i feel stuck and lost. :("
BPD,eurnt3d,t3_ch8umt,1563996546.0,fuck. i am on the SAME exact boat as you. i have so much anxiety over feeling like i have no consistent idea what the hell i want to do with my life. i feel so behind -- and not in a sense of comparing myself to others. i just feel behind and lost as to where i want to be.
