‚ÄúI recognise these feelings and they do not scare me‚Äù 
‚ÄúDisappointing others will not kill me‚Äù 
‚Äúothers do not think of my failures nearly as much as I do‚Äù
‚ÄúI am powerful for even being aware of how I‚Äôm feeling‚Äù

For the first paragraph?, I talked about climate change and what theology teaches about creation and our duty to care for it. For the second: society and human action and what theology teachings we should adhere to, and for the last (and probably the most important), I discussed how we can achieve salvation through what Fischer and the pope talks about.

I feel like I have more power because I choose wether he can mess with my emotions or not. I have the power by keeping him so far away, but it‚Äôs not to torment him, it‚Äôs to keep myself strong. 

I guess he‚Äôs kind of manipulated by saying he‚Äôs so sorry and that‚Äôs he‚Äôs already changed so much.

I think he definitely thinks those thoughts like ‚Äúdamn, she looks good‚Äù,  but it‚Äôs more subconscious so he doesn‚Äôt think to say it. That‚Äôs when you can rely on actions. If he‚Äôs initiating foreplay o is affectionate, that‚Äôs a great sign. The fact that he compliments your personality more is probably because that‚Äôs what has more value to him at this point, since you‚Äôve been dating for a little while now. In the beginning it‚Äôs all about attraction, but as he gets to know you, he attacked to your personality. I also think people compliment on things they like to be complimented on, and maybe a compliment about his personality means more to him than a compliment about his looks? Eg, when I would tell my ex he looked great, he‚Äôd say thanks ect, but when I complimented one of his skills, he would light up.

Then you will feel great again. Then you will miss them. Then you will kinda hate them, then maybe you‚Äôll feel like you love them so much you could die. You feel so many emotions. That is okay. You will never wipe them of your memory, but you will move on, in time. The bottom line is that if it‚Äôs meant to be, it will.

So good that you‚Äôre solid on the counselling, that will help.  

I completely get that. It‚Äôs like hello???? We talked about this last time. I think they process it but just don‚Äôt do anything about it. They don‚Äôt change their perspective or behaviour.

If it was up to me, we‚Äôd talk it out and get it over with, but he refused, would be passive aggressive or eventually outright nasty at times. Because I‚Äôm human that would upset me. We all want someone who will just be nice to us, who will treat us how we treat them. But it‚Äôs just how they are. It‚Äôs how they‚Äôve grown up to be. They were never taught to regulate their emotions and say how they feel. We can ask them to and explain why, but we can‚Äôt teach them to. It shouldn‚Äôt be an ongoing lesson. 

Eventually I asked him to go to counselling to learn how to communicate calmly and without attacking me but he refused. I left him once because of that and then again because he blew up at me. That was the last time. The lady who wrote that article has a lot more!"
