I know plenty of intelligent, highly educated women that do astrology because it's fun to them, like a hobby. It's not that deep and doesn't actually speak of their character in some negative way.

I'm sure most people have some weird, harmless beliefs (probably even you!) - sometimes you just need to accept it as a quirk. That said, relationships need respect to function, so if you're unable to look past it and it's seriously affecting your opinion of her, that's a problem. If it makes so you uncomfortable you can just tell her you aren't interested in discussing those things."

If she wants to hide something from you, she will, and she can do that outside of the house as well. And this is a really good way for her to build resentment and do exactly that."

StrongCurves,es4hc8f,t1_es46xyr,1561584850.0,"Okay. I know the diet part looks scary but it's not THAT scary, I promise. You don't need to be super strict and detailed with it, especially in the beginning. 

I'd just focus on being more consistent for now, like maybe having set meal times and increasing your protein. If it's not too much for you, maybe you can try to keep a food diary for a couple of weeks, just to get a better look at your habits, and then adjust accordingly.

I don't really obsess over food and I still manage to keep my daily caloric/protein intake most of the time. For me it's three meals a day - for breakfast and dinner I try to add eggs, cheese, cheese spreads, hummus or stuff like that, for the protein; my lunch is usually meat (chicken/fish/lean beef) and some veggies/salad. If I want a snack it's usually fruit, greek yogurt or chocolate milk. Obviously some days it just doesn't happen or I switch it up, not a big deal. Also I don't really deprive myself of sodas, pizzas or whatever completely when I go out with friends, I just try not to do it often.

If you're anxious, I think it's more important to find something that works for you and build those healthier habits slowly in the beginning rather than overwhelming yourself with everything. Regular exercise without some strict diet adjustments is still much better than no exercise."

StrongCurves,es3kxfh,t3_c5mvi6,1561564892.0,"I understand what you mean about anxiety in general. And I was also worried about looking stupid in the gym while trying to figure out everything in the beginning. But I assure you, most people there are only focused on themselves and their workout, and a lot of them are also worried about other people looking at them, just like you are. 

For me, what helped the most is doing the bodyweight/at-home program to get a little bit stronger and more confident. Maybe you could do that for at least a couple of weeks? Get familiar with the exercises, muscle activation etc.

You can pick an off-peak time when there's less people at the gym. It does get easier everytime you go and exercise builds confidence, especially weightlifting.

> The second thing that has prevented me from getting started for so long is honestly the diet.

Are you looking to lose weight or just build muscle? What does your diet look like currently?"
