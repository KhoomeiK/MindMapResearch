Other than that though, what about the police that are out there dealing with idiots at very close hand? What about the fire brigade who are still having to work? Don't forget how close the police and fire brigade have to sit in their vehicles too. Don't forget about the army who are delivering the much needed PPE. The list could go on but it's always the NHS that are getting the hype. This is the same NHS that was on it's arse because of austerity.

I can't really give you any advice for your skin I'm afraid but I thought I'd let you know that I wash my bedding with dish soap in my washing machine and it really helps to get the staining out. My mum also does the same with their bedding because of my dad's greasy body. I think being greasy is just a cross we have to bear. On the positive side I've heard that people with greasy skin don't get as many wrinkles as the skin doesn't get dry!

I'm a good writer so can manage that but I've never written a letter to a health professional before and am a little unsure how to go about it. I'm a bit nervous to be honest as I don't want them to label me as a trouble maker as I know mental health teams can.

It's sounds like you've had an effort to get where you are too. Where I'm going to have been a major pain with telling me I'm not even on the waiting list when another member of staff had told me previously that I was and I've had letters from them too telling that I'll be sent an appointment to be seen. I've dealt a lot with mental health services over the last two decades and they are all pretty much unhelpful. The whole system just seems geared up so you'll give up waiting and that means they won't have to see you. It seems your letter gave them a kick up the backside that they needed. I wonder how long you'll wait for the diagnosis in person now? I think the benefits go more on symptoms than diagnosis. Having said that I'm not sure how serious they take a claim without a name to it. They are a law unto themselves anyway but you have to try."
DWPhelp,fq1bo3v,t3_ggcsi8,1589044145.0,Hi there. Do you mind if I ask a question. Was you on a waiting list for an appointment before covid started? I ask because I've been waiting so long already for an appointment for an ASD assessment and now with Covid I expect it going to be many more months of waiting again for an appointment now. I'm just wondering if they are still doing appointments like they did over the phone for your son for everybody else? Sorry to hear about your children being autistic. It must be hard for all of you and even more so at the moment.

DiagnoseMe,fmpjzmv,t1_fmpj1st,1586282196.0,I'm really sorry to hear that. I need to tell you that I am not a doctor and I can't really comment whether she is getting the right care or not because I do not know the procedures in your country. I have however had many family and friends that have passed from cancer and I do know that the patient will get very sleepy on the morphine and will really just keep on sleeping until they pass. She will eventually pass while she is asleep. I don't know what else to say to you and recommend waiting for someone to hopefully give you some proper medical advice. You could call an ambulance and see what they say when they get there. They might take her in to end of life care. I don't feel your sister has been given very good care. I don't know how much Covid-19 is affecting all this though but she should not be in pain.

emotionalabuse,fmphrx9,t1_fmohc6r,1586281068.0,"It's really hard because the thought of my parents is with me everyday. I've been ill really since I can remember but have been really ill for the whole of my adulthood. It's stopped me having a career as I've not been able to work for a lot of years. I've not got any confidence, I'm social phobic too so have no friends. They knocked all my confidence out of me. The only saving grace for me is that I've got a fantastic husband and we've got two dogs. I always wanted a dog since I can remember but I was never allowed one when I lived with my parents. If it wasn't for my little family I wouldn't he here because I would have committed suicide to put myself out of my misery. The illness is absolutely terrible and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. It's even worse when you are really ill and your parents are still telling you that you are wrong about what's made you ill to start with. That's what my mum does. I can't talk to her and I most certainly can't talk to my dad. My dad used to hold me up against the wall while he held his fist in the air at me while he was going absolutely mad. My mum has always told me that's it was because I was naughty when actually all it was was my mental illness showing itself. The mental illness that they caused in the first place."
AskDocs,fmpfftr,t3_fwkt5l,1586279882.0,I've got Bipolar and Borderline Personality Disorder and Anxiety and I suffer many breakdowns. I ALWAYS get the runny arse when my mental health is bad.

This will be over with soon enough and then normal life will resume.

I don't know if you can get Alka Seltzer (we get it here in England) where you are but it apparently helps well with the pain of a UTI. If you can't get it then you may have something similar in your country. You definitely need antibiotics too though to kill the bacteria that's causing your infection.

My mums UTIs started when she had her hysterectomy sometime in the early 90s. Also, I see you are in UK. I read that Alka Seltzer are good for the pain of a UTI.

KindVoice,flukq29,t1_fltiyme,1585504565.0,I've had the same thoughts for about the same amount of time as you maybe longer. It's absolutely exhausting and I wouldn't blame anybody for ending it. Peace of mind seems a luxury to me and although I'm getting on with life the best I can I do look forward to finally having some peace at the end of it.
KindVoice,fluiv1g,t3_fqxfq5,1585503481.0,"I'm suicidal a lot due to severe mental illness. I would NEVER want anyone to feel guilty that they hadn't helped me especially a stranger. You are a beautiful person for trying to help someone you didn't even know. If someone is determined to end their life then they will do it regardless. Hopefully the person you tried to help has just taken themselves off of Reddit and is doing okay. Social media can be hard enough to deal with even for someone that doesn't suffer from mental illness because it's a mine field of trolls and nasty people. Personally, I've deleted Facebook and Twitter as I couldn't handle the crap that goes on on there. I've finally been able to settle on Reddit as I find it is moderated so much better and there aren't quite so many idiots with their stupid opinions. I'm sorry you've been dealing with this and it's hard to make you feel better but please remember that you tried to help no matter the outcome."

relationships,fltxpcz,t3_fr4roc,1585490316.0,"Ask yourself this. If the shoe was on the other foot and your friends treated your fiancée like that would you put up with your friends treating your loved one like that? Personally, if my friends treated my fiancée like that I would dump the friends. They are not true friends. True friends would accept your fiancée and be happy to get to know them. His friends should also be happy that their friend has found love. I could never let my friends treat my husband like that and I know full well my husband would never let his friends treat me like that. That's the way it is when you've found your best friend and soul mate. My friends would most definitely be dropped from a great height if they behaved like but I would also be questioning my fiancée on why he is happy to let this situation carry on. Maybe he hasn't got your back as much as you think. These people aren't friends. Maybe you need to rethink your relationship with your husband and ask why he is alright with you being left out of the group of friends and their wives. Sorry you are going through this."
