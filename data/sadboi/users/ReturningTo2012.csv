schizophrenia,fr5drcb,t1_fr5djlx,1589906888.0,Sounds good
schizophrenia,fr5chh0,t1_fr5bip0,1589906279.0,You can vent to me if you want. Feel free to reply or private message me
schizophrenia,fr5apwd,t3_gmr417,1589905432.0,Hey how’s it going?
schizophrenia,fqiq3g3,t3_gj4p8l,1589399354.0,I don’t really have any advice off the bat but I think that’s a great idea and if you have any questions about the experience of someone with schizophrenia you can feel free to ask me
schizophrenia,fqipndz,t1_fqiac4s,1589399184.0,I think it was just based on long term psychosis
schizophrenia,fqi5xv1,t3_gj332i,1589390813.0,I was diagnosed psychosis not otherwise specified for a year before getting the schizo diagnosis
schizophrenia,fqfwcqb,t3_gil1yp,1589332999.0,"I thought for a while that the virus was divine punishment for my own impure, intrusive thoughts. Luckily I got on a good medication so now I know that’s false"
Chinese,fqetems,t1_fqetbew,1589313288.0,No problem. Thanks for the translations!
Chinese,fqerrro,t1_fqeqrhu,1589312521.0,"Thank you so much! This is really helpful

Edit: So the first three are all chapters of the lotus sutra right?"
Buddhism,fqeip4g,t1_fqeimqc,1589308204.0,Thank you!
Buddhism,fqehvmc,t1_fqehjra,1589307817.0,Thank you. Would I need to get the printed image blessed as well?

schizophrenia,fqaaoz0,t3_ghqgqb,1589215809.0,I’m the bird and the hedgehog. This is hilarious thanks for creating it
schizophrenia,fq6w1vk,t1_fq6t5fr,1589138575.0,I mostly recite the heart sutra right now and chant the name of Amida Buddha. I’m new to Buddhism so I haven’t found a teacher yet but I’m looking for one. I emailed one of the local temples but I haven’t heard back yet
schizophrenia,fq6j0l8,t1_fq6igpn,1589132460.0,Thanks for sharing. What kind of practices do you do? Like do you chant or misty meditate or something else?
schizophrenia,fq6ixcz,t1_fq6hplc,1589132411.0,That’s awesome. I recite Namo Amida Butsu. I recite it in Japanese because I’m more familiar with Japanese Buddhism. I also do other practices like right now I’ve been reciting the heart sutra mantra and studying the prajnaparamita. I have intrusive thoughts too which make it difficult. Thanks for sharing.
Buddhism,fpt3tj4,t1_fpt05r0,1588884383.0,Thank you. Part of the reason I am thinking about joining the Shingon sect is just because there’s a temple in my area. If I don’t find the right teacher there I will try a different sect.
Buddhism,fpsmv39,t1_fpsmn2p,1588876153.0,Thank you!
Buddhism,fpsm68g,t1_fpslnn3,1588875816.0,Thank you
Buddhism,fpsljbv,t1_fpshnym,1588875506.0,The biggest reason is I still live with my very Protestant parents due to health issues so I would want to wait until I move out. I don’t think they would kick my out or anything like that but I do fear the repercussions of converting while I still live with them
Buddhism,fpsledn,t1_fpsio1l,1588875439.0,Thank you
Buddhism,fpsldty,t1_fpsiieo,1588875432.0,How do I go about studying the Dharma? Should I read and study sutras? Or is there something else I should be doing?
schizophrenia,fps7icf,t1_fps6dxg,1588868769.0,Ummmm... the delusion evolved over time for sure. The organization is a real world organization but they’re definitely not trying to take over the world like I thought. Hope that answers your question
schizophrenia,fps4s0l,t3_gf98kj,1588867455.0,"According to my therapist delusions of grandeur are more common with bipolar disorder but they do happen with schizophrenia as well. For me, delusions of grandeur are often paired with delusions of persecution. For example, I believed I was being targeted because I was the only one who could save the world from a shady organization that was trying to take over."
schizophrenia,fpiri4w,t3_gdows5,1588647089.0,I dissociate a lot. My psychiatrist thinks it’s cause of my schizophrenia but my therapist thinks it’s cause of my anxiety
mentalhealth,fp8uqgz,t3_gc27wr,1588403646.0,"I’ve had delusions of persecution, and yes delusions can happen as a result of bipolar disorder"
schizophrenia,fp775si,t3_gbo24u,1588365282.0,"I had restlessness on abilify for a long time, but after being on it for like two years it went away."
mentalhealth,fp556ra,t1_fp4t6ds,1588316670.0,Yes that is definitely possible.
mentalhealth,fp555zl,t1_fp4rloo,1588316649.0,No problem
mentalhealth,fp4rh0h,t1_fp4qq1j,1588305566.0,Everyone experiences it differently
mentalhealth,fp4qllx,t1_fp4pir9,1588304971.0,"Probably. Schizos are rarely a danger to other people, but without medication I wouldn’t be able to take care of myself and would therefore be a danger to myself and require hospitalization"
mentalhealth,fp4oj3d,t1_fp4o1xb,1588303606.0,No it doesn’t offend me. You can only be hospitalized against your will if you’re a danger to yourself or others. I’m not a danger to anyone therefore I’m not in the hospital
mentalhealth,fp4no1v,t1_fp4n89p,1588303044.0,Yes my psychiatrist prescribed a new medication and that’s what stopped the episode
mentalhealth,fp4mrzi,t1_fp4mjym,1588302475.0,"Well, delusions can be pretty much anything. In my most recent episode I believed that the coronavirus was my fault and on a certain day the government would come take me away and I would be killed to stop the virus. For me, it usually starts small. At first I just believed that the virus was my fault, then I started to believe that I had to die to stop the virus, then I started believing all about the certain date and the government coming to take me away."
mentalhealth,fp4meu9,t1_fp4m9kt,1588302244.0,"When I'm healthy, neither. I'm just a person. When I'm having an episode, it depends on the delusion. Sometimes I feel superior and sometimes I feel inferior just depending on what my delusion is at the time."
mentalhealth,fp4m4rl,t1_fp4m17l,1588302069.0,Yes. Schizophrenia
mentalhealth,fp4lx24,t3_gba6eq,1588301939.0,"With delusions anyway, it feels like you've finally found the truth. It seems as real and plain as anything and you often wonder why other people can't see the truth. That's what it's like for me anyway."
mentalhealth,fozbsox,t3_gafmft,1588188021.0,"I would see a general practitioner if you can. It might be a mental health issue, but it could also be a psychical thing. I was experiencing some of the same stuff and it turns out I have sleep apnea."
schizophrenia,fot7ow1,t3_g9fgt3,1588046545.0,Abilify works wonders for me
Christianity,fogsc4q,t3_g75pup,1587756421.0,I asked this in its own post but it didn't get much traction so I thought I'd ask here too. Does anyone know of any Christian literary journals/magazines that publish short fiction? I've been looking all over the internet but can't find anything.
schizophrenia,fobfuqj,t3_g6h3xr,1587659358.0,I’ve been hospitalized once. It wasn’t a good experience. They just put me on a mood stabilizer despite me never having had a mood disorder and then discharged me
