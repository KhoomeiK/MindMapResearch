Don't forget over 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. Or the bigotry against Muslims in America right now.   
   
Many American Christians and their religious leaders are so alienated from the Spirit of Christ that they must deride other faiths to prop themselves up. They preach the evils of Catholics who are beholden to a foreign dictator, Jews who murdered Jesus, Muslims that want to kill you, and Mormons who worship Joseph Smith and invented their own bible.  
  
These very-same 'Christians' are also quick to make a corrupt adulterer their king, proudly support stripping children from their parents at the border and keeping them in cages, verbally abuse people trying to prevent illness from spreading in this country, threaten violence against civil servants for doing their job to protect the public, advocate for war while celebrating the deaths of 'America's Enemies', and call for eliminating social welfare programs that help the sick, poor, and needy.

""By their fruits ye shall know them""
  
These are the members of ""The Church of the Devil""  
    
Many years ago I joined the church under the leadership of a wise Branch President, William Carlton, Dunlap. He alerted me to an unusual phenomenon that is commonly experienced by people who join the church. Family, friends, and acquaintances who have known you for years - never invited you to church - shared their testimony - or otherwise expressed on iota of concern for your soul - will suddenly accost you with anti-Mormon literature and great concern over your new choice of religion.   
   
Why are they all so suddenly motivated to tear down your new faith - without offering anything to replace it? Because they are unwittingly motivated by the spirit of the adversary - who seeks to destroy men's faith.    
    
See Phillipians 1  
  
>Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:  
>The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:  
>But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.  
>What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.  
  
If Christ is preached - and a person draws closer to Christ - then good has been done - even if the preacher is himself insincere. Do not tear down that person's love of Jesus for any reason.  
  
I will never say anything to undermine another person's faith - through criticism or debate. There is no profit in it - and it only serves the purposes of the adversary. I will only tell them to keep the good they have, and if they want to add to it - I will gladly share what I know.    
    
The best people I know in other churches are also this way. They've never sought to argue or criticize my religion. They've only shared their love of the Gospel and the lifestyle it has given them. And I do the same. All our testimonies of the Savior are strengthened as a result.  
  
Don't make the mistake of thinking Mormons and Catholics are the only religions that are 'picked on'. Satan inspires people to undermine all that is good - and if you are persecuted - you are in good company.

When it comes to art, God was literally made in man's image.  

Isaiah 53 states:

>he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.  
  
Jesus was likely a perfectly ordinary looking Jewish man of his time. His mother, Mary was described a beautiful, so I expect he had a nice-looking face. Being a hard working carpenter he was also likely strong, lean and fit.  
  
By our standards today he would probably be very attractive - at least, he would be to people who aren't bigoted against dark-complected, people from the Middle-East. 
  
Check out the image linked below - which is one of those composites made from many photos to arrive at an 'average' Israeli men. It is very likely Jesus looked more like this than that famous portrait by  Del Parsons.

I think that - if it all turns out to be true - when we meet Jesus, we're unlikely to recognize him at first look. However, those who enjoyed the companionship of the Holy Ghost in this life, will immediately recognize him by that feeling in His presence.  
  
I imagine it being like the explosive joy my dog exhibits when I come home to him after work - only this time I get to feel it. The greatest person who ever lived - who we have more reason to love than anyone - and did everything for us.

I don't believe Heavenly Father desires for any of his children to exist alone and without the emotional intimacy of a marriage partner. Yet he sent us into this world - subject to the kind of variation that includes same-gender sexual orientation.

The Church of Jesus Christ is financed though the tithing of its members - which is not dependent on church attendance. I pay my tithing using an app on my phone.  
  
This - combined with the fact that the President of the LDS church is a retired heart surgeon - means that there is no pressure to make the church resume meetings before circumstances indicate it is very safe to do so.  
  
Very interesting to see that the Lord's Prophet is advising people to be wise and shelter in place - while financially and politically motivated people in high places are campaigning for ending all restrictions, while lying and defaming and obstructing the very people who are speaking the truth and trying to help.
