I find that therapists tend to like to move the blame onto their patients. But the truth is you SHOULD be picky.

It's hard to find a job that pays enough to support a family with kids while inflation's gone up but wages are stagnant. Housing prices are ridiculous. No one can afford a home anymore without steep mortgages because the government lets evil real estate moguls take over the whole thing and ruin the market for everyone. Also we're still fighting for maternal/paternal leave.

Overpopulation comes from other countries, not countries like the U.S. In fact, the U.S. and a lot of other western countries are suffering from a LOW birth rate. Especially Japan. The population is aging and there aren't enough young people to take care of them. 

That being said, we don't need to encourage people to breed but not making it so difficult for people who genuinely want kids to survive in this economic turmoil, would help. The best way to prevent overpopulation is by choice - by respecting the choice of people who DON'T want kids. Even if overpopulation weren't an issue, going childfree is still a very personal choice that should STILL be respected. Likewise, the people who actually want kids and willing to provide them with the love that they need, should be able to do so. Even people who adopt are going to need the financial means to buy a good-sized home and pay for the kids' needs. Right now, we're making it impossible for people who actually want kids, whether adopted or not, and that's why these people keep delaying on starting a family (not because they don't truly want kids, but because of economical/societal reasons).
