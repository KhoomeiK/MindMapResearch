Also, I’m Turkish Armenian, and I have never heard that before. I think you’re reaching after you were called out for being sexist. Just because you don’t want to talk about issues doesn’t mean that no one else can, or that their discussions aren’t related, just because you feel like women feeling threatened isn’t something that is worth your time. That’s not a decision for you to make. This is Reddit, get used to it or get off. This platform is full of commentary from people all over the world, and you don’t get to silence them. But you know, whatever floats your extremely misinformed boat, dude."

They used to make me late for work because they’d form a single-file line and just stand in front of traffic. Very pretty birds but also birds that I have wanted to kick once or twice.
