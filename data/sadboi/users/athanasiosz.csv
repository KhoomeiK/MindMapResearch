bestoflegaladvice,fr39bnr,t1_fr2vxjx,1589852572.0,Owners of small aggressive dogs need to also be held accountable. They seem to feel like their dogs are harmless because they’re small but they’re fucking not. My very large shepherd is scared of small dogs after being attacked by several as a puppy (I’m going to burn every Flexi leash on this planet I stg) and somebody’s nasty little JRT attacked her and chased her into a busy road on our very first walk through our new suburb last year. She’s just incredibly lucky that she didn’t get hit by a car and that JRT is lucky I was too busy being worried to fucking stomp on it.

As far as that kid is concerned, this may well be the worst thing that has ever happened to her so far, because she hasn’t experienced anything worse yet. You can’t expect a child who is suffering, even if it’s over something you consider petty, to logically go “ah yes my experience is nothing compared to my mothers life at a comparable age so I’ll just accept it and roll with it”, because in her experience so far, this is the worst thing ever. 

I wish parents would show a little goddamn compassion for their kids, honestly. Obviously they shouldn’t let her move in with some random woman who happens to be the boyfriends mother, but they’re setting her up for some issues down the line by invalidating her feelings so callously imo."

What people need to understand is that children do not have a frame of reference for this shit. Children, regardless of how smart they are, cannot ""look at the bigger picture"" because they, by virtue of being children, have not experienced bigger, badder, scarier things than this. So when kids are upset about things we consider petty, we need to remember that to this kid, who hasn't experienced worse things than what they're experiencing right now, things we consider petty or silly really are the ""worse thing to ever happen to them"". So while this story itself may or may not be true, it's ridiculous for grown adults to mock children for being upset over something they cannot fully grasp the magnitude of.
