askdrugs,fmy9v48,t1_fmy83wk,1586481274.0,"I live in yemen actually i was using kaht recreationally not knowing i have adhd and not realising that that was the reason every one on kaht hated the fact that it made their train of thought a rollercoaster while i had a complete different experience it made me focused and felt more mature and handled my emotions better .

And at that time i did not have alot of responsibilities  
So as a recreational user i abused and i used to use what 4 normal people would use  üòÖ 


Time went by things happened i got multiple jops gave my self excuses and left them or at least not bother to hold on to them also struggling just to convince my self to attend classes so i searched and searched read about every possible mental illness i might have and its definitely adhd and when i read about adderall i saw it was like khat in every aspect there is .

But now i am tolerant to kaht it takes time to kick in and i start functioning properly after working hours üòÇüòÇüòÇ
And that is just not practical i need something that dosent need alot of time to kick in or at least dosent require me to sit down chewing and waste all that time waiting for it to kick in ."
askdrugs,fmy6t68,t1_fmy59lk,1586479359.0,"Ok so i have adhd but where i live there is no adderall but there is kaht and i noticed it helps me alot when i use kaht . 

But i hate that it takes 4 to 6 hours to kick in and i abused it alot back in the days and built tolerance  now i need large amounts for it to work on me . 

Have you tried kaht ? Also it beeing very close to adderall am i tolerant to that to ?"
askdrugs,fmy65hj,t1_fmxs2kh,1586478952.0,"No i said i disagree with the first comment 
And you said what ? 
 
So i answered to what i am disagreeing with 
 Which was based on what i understood   from his comment was :
And correct me if i am wrong 

 that though people say they use it for productivity thier countries are failing  and he disregarded oil politics and  especially he forgot that people don't always do what they say some use it for productivity and others just say the do while they just like the high that comes from it .

What i mean is kaht has nothing to do in a whole country failing or not and you cant judge kaht by the stautes of country nor can you judge a country by kaht using or not . 

Get me now ?"

Crainn,fmx2bzj,t1_fjuzljo,1586457213.0,Dude is there any organization trying to spread knowledge about drugs and make communities that are already accepting a drug of some sort more productive .
Crainn,fmx1t8v,t1_fjv5wo2,1586456948.0,"I am from yemen and what i really despise and hate is the amount of propaganda and money spent trying to demonize qat , saying its addictive while its not saying it has negative effects on the economy while it literally provides thousands of jops and taxation mone , saying it makes people lazy while its a stimulant , saying its a waste of money and causes. People to neglect there families. 

But the worst is that this propaganda made some people see qat as the cause of every problem they have  
 ignoring facts and what there problems are really are
If the money spent on propaganda was spent educating people on when it's bad for you how to have a healthy life and whats important and whats not important that would really help the community . 

Instead they imprinted the idea that if you chew you are an addict and cant do any thing in your life and people should keep judgeing you .

And a few people accepted the idea and keep trying to push it on others and or feels helpless and just stop trying to improve there life's while ignoring the reality and facts that they are in a country where 25 million human being chew every day and work and get married and live happy fulfilling life's .

Even scientific study's in yemen about qat are as baised as fuck in a country where every one chewing you come across a study with 50 participants and the conclusion is it causes cancer or heart deases while . 

While the 50 participants are a part of 25 million community that has no proplems of such and these study's are used in propagandas as facts .

One thing i am sure of qat dosent cause anything I've been every where in yemen and met and chewed with all sorts of people with different backgrounds educations and mentalities and they are all normal humans with normal problems dreams and lifes some prospers and some not."
