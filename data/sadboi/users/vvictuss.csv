Perhaps I've been a shitty neighbor, but I've changed! Why won't you let me take your car? I need it. you're being selfish for not wanting me to use something that's so clearly yours. 

Artists ALWAYS get tossed aside in situations like these. We put HOURS into our work. It's as valuable to us as any of our other posessions. Every piece of art I've created means something very personally to me. This is quite literally stealing, it's highly illegal, and they could face very serious legal reprocussions if the art were taken from any other artist that this girl didn't know personally. I do art commissions, meaning part of my income is from selling art. If this were to happen to me (which it has) I would not hesitate to take action to get my artwork off her Go Fund Me page, since they are violating copyright laws and would be STEALING from me. 

There is absolutely no reason it should be any different just because OP knows this girl. It's too obvious that they knew where the art came from too, they go to the same highschool and have a pretty direct connection. The girl was very conscious of her actions and I can almost guarantee she knew the art belonged to OP.

learntodraw,fno42aq,t3_g2hhib,1587111287.0,"Shading! Just drawing rocks will result in indecipherable lines. They will just look like abstract drawings of vaguely rock shapes. Don’t draw so heavy with the “internal” shapes, focus on how the light interacts with the rock and look at the shapes the shadows make for it. Avoid the finger blurring technique for ANY sort of shading, though. It causes the shading to be very blotchy and it’s hard to get depth properly that way. It also has a tendency to result in fingerprints and smudges in other parts of your paper where they are not wanted. If you’re uncertain or uncomfortable with shading any other way, look at how other artists do it or find a tutorial to follow. This isn’t copying at all, lots of artists throughout history have derived inspiration from more experienced artists and it’s not a wrong thing to do. 

Maybe unrelated to the current topic, but get yourself a sketchbook or at least draw on blank paper, not lined. Get in the habit of taking your sketchbook everywhere. 

Future you will thank yourself, for one, since it’s easier to track progress that way and if you create something you’re proud of it really sucks when it happens to be on lined paper. Lined paper is also more smudge prone and not great to draw on, and some people struggle with drawing accurately on it since the lines kinda get in the way and your brain automatically wants to stay in the lines."

Especially if you're at risk for genuinely fucking that child up from the start. I think too many people have this outrageous idea that  when they have a kid, they'll overcome their mental illness because their Parental Instincts will kick in and allow them to be great parents. Sadly, this just isn't the case. 

I'm adopted and both of my birth parents were really fucked up. My birthdad gave me addictive tendencies and probably my psychosis, and my birthmom gave me bipolar and depression and all the rest of the shit, including dumb things like my center of balance is off or something (i dont rememer what it's called, I'm clinically uncoordinated).

She turned her whole life around and went on to have 3 more kids and I absolutely love her, but she honestly regrets giving birth to me because she's watched me grow up with everything she dealt with and more (thanks, dad) but can't do much about it, and she feels like it's her fault. We're super open with each other, and she's told me she wishes she would've aborted me sometimes to save me from all of this. I also have wished this too, quite often lol. 

THe only thing worse than going through the illness is watching someone you love more than anything in the world go through it. Adoption isn't a bad thing, either. There's no difference in the connection I have with my adopted parents, no difference in the connection I have with my adopted siblings, and I don't feel any less loved than my adopted parents' biological kid. 

And back to the kids suffering -- the abuse rates in foster care are terrible. The amount of kids going hungry or homeless are insane. There are enough kids in need of good parents already. People need to stop having more fucking kids."
schizoaffective,fmv9p17,t3_fuhc79,1586409947.0,"A lot of common antipsychotics cause extreme drowsiness.

My parents thought I was just staying up late or being lazy  and my teachers did too because I slept through the classes I ever made it to. I didn't understand why I couldn't stay awake either. Apparently it's because Seroquel will put you out on it's own, but add Trazodone and Clonazepam (?), and then the array of other shit they had me try around then too makes a chemical soup that turned me into a zombie for 3 years. 

I get the hating sleep thing too -- I have huge problems with nightmares. I don't remember the last time I had a ""good"" dream. 

Look up the side effects of the meds you're on and even the effect they have with each other, since different types do weird things when they're taken together. You might need to choose to switch medications or try something else out, which is scary especially with psychosis, but if the meds are improving one area of your life and making another ten times worse, are they worth it? I eneded up quitting cold turkey (STUPID, do not do!!!) because I was going insane from the side effects. 

Idk, weigh your options I guess. If the side effects aren't worth bearing or especially if they're worse than the codition you're trying to treat, I'd reccomend talking to a doctor about trying something new."

There are a lot of cases where the evidence is undeniable, though. Someone doesn't just accidentally end up with files after files of CP on their laptop, or have four different children mention that their teacher touched them all because they wanted him mutilated. 

I'm not in favor of innocent people being mutilated, but if we're going to be afraid of that then we shouldn't send anyone to jail or prison or sentence them to death. Hell, even parking tickets should be outlawed! you never know if it's just the cop lying or if someone set them up.

TrueOffMyChest,fgnxbte,t1_fgm97ih,1580954944.0,"it IS a mental illness. I understand the political connotations to the word now, but it's not what the word actually means. 

There's a huge difference between being upset over a political or social stance and having an anxiety attack because the neighbor's dog escaped and is running at you, or going into a psychotic episode because loud noises trigger hallucinations and someone just dropped a plate.

In therapy we use it as a way to treat trauma and mental illness and recognize what causes negative effects so the person can prepare for them and if not overcome, at least learn to cope or tolerate them. 

I do agree with your intended meaning behind the post. Someone who is offended over political differences doesn't have to act out, and it is their responsibility to get over it, not have people cater to what offends them, although i find a lot of people will say something like ""I think trans people are less than human"" and then get all huffy when someone takes offense to it. 

Triggered just isn't the right word for this. It gets on my nerves that the actual meaning of the word has been changed like this, since it's an actual therapeutic term to help people live normal lives."

characterdrawing,fgi7sz2,t1_fgi74nt,1580810105.0,"Romulus is an NPC in the campaign I run and yeah, Lathander is kind of an ass. The basic story of my campaign is an oppressive church, which derived inspiration from Lathander but later twisted it, is trying to keep a grip on the people as they’re rapidly experiencing a secular revolution. Church summons Tarrasque as a “cleansing” sort of thing - Noah’s Ark but instead of a flood it’s everything being eaten. 

Surviving townsfolk flee through an entrance to the Underdark. They’re trapped there while a tarrasque eats the world they knew for an undetermined amount of time. Bad shenanigans ensue. 

Players will find out later than Lathander did have a hand pretty directly in all the chaos, which sucks for a PC who is also an Aasimar paladin of Lathander (a half brother to Rom). He is extremely and blissfully ignorant of his Father’s true intentions. Super innocent. I can’t wait to shatter the confidence in his purpose >:(

I really went full force into twisting a relatively good deity, so I’m glad someone thinks it’s interesting! I was worried about getting shit for it since a lot of the online DnD community seems to criticize homebrew content."

Both are absolutely mind blowing to me, and I think a lot of people have the same mindset. Art is so subjective and individualized that believing that time spent on a piece equals quality is stupid. Personally I’d hate spending weeks on something, especially since I’m not a fan of painting anything super realistic. One isn’t better than the other. All art is good in its own way."

ArtistLounge,fgi4iyx,t3_exzkf7,1580805166.0,"I get this but I also draw a lot of NSFW content so it’s kinda embarrassing for them to see it on social media even if they know I draw it/have seen it in person. It really is like reading a diary, which is funny because I’d rather share it with complete strangers than my closest friends. 

I think part of that comes from the worth of their criticism. I care way less about the opinion of a stranger. But my friends and family... their opinion on my art is really scary to think about. I don’t think I’ve showed my mom any art for months (the SFW art of course) despite her always being SUPER supportive of it.  It sounds like that’s kind of what you’re dealing with. 

At first I resorted to blocking them and not mentioning the art account, and if they asked I said I deleted it. Eventually tho I realized they wanted to see it more. They were super encouraging and accepting of my art, and I was like “oh they care. Maybe I’ll let them see it.” 

If they are being supportive and uplifting about it, let them look! Maybe start out showing them in person if it makes u less uncomfortable. Talk about your art and explain what it means to you. 

If they aren’t as supportive, if they are tossing it to the side or giving u shit for it, they don’t deserve to see it, and you might need to re-evaluate some friendships. If doing art makes you happy, keep doing it. Fuck everybody else. 

The fear of criticism is real though and I get it, but if it makes u feel good inside, do the art and do it how you want. Better said than done, I know, but take the steps to get more confident in your talent!! It’ll be worth it, I promise. I still get a high from any compliments, and it makes the negativity sting less. The art community is honestly very encouraging most of the time and it makes me happy to see people coming out with their art and owning it. 

Best of luck to you, you’ll get there."

Romulus, Aasimar Paladin of Lathander.

As with most characters he’s got a painfully drawn out backstory no one wants to sit and read for 30 mins so here’s the summary.

Born in a desert temple with his half-brother, raised by a group of cultist women.

Taught to fight and pray and do Paladin shit from the time they could walk.

Brothers loved each other, had differing opinions on their Father’s morally grey agenda.

When he was 17 his brother rejected Lathander and fell, and out of pity and fear, Rom killed him.

Travelled the world accomplishing tasks for the Morninglord, seeking out the other Aasimar children Lathander had to gather them, secretly wanting a family.

Did morally grey things at the expense of the Common Folk.

Minor deity of justice sweeps him off to a pocket in reality to make him pay for things he did.

Falls in love and sold his soul to said minor deity of justice after she tortured him for 3 years.

Returns, Lathader tells him she was a Bad Person and he Should Not Have Trusted Her, because she seduced him into believing the things she said like “hey your dad wants to let a tarrasque eat the earth and thats Not Ok” and “maybe you shouldn’t take advantage of and kill innocent people because your dad said do it”.

Feels guilty, will do anything to fix his perceived mistakes, spent the next several years getting super invested in being a really tough asshole in the name of Lathander."

I've never had a problem with mine. 

They treat employees like investments. If you put effort into treating them well, you get better results. It's easier to be pleasant and welcoming when work doesn't make you want to die.

TrueOffMyChest,ff404sm,t1_ff3yrm6,1579552645.0,"Swords and machetes are way less dangerous than firearms. They pose the same danger in inexperienced hands as kitchen knives and baseball bats. A gun is dangerous to keep in houses in certain circumstances. I would have one for self defense, but I'm high risk for suicide so I don't. I shouldn't have guns. Some don't because they're nervous about their kids. No matter how tight you keep them secured, kids seem to have ways of getting around it, and if they're so tightly locked away it's harder to get to the weapon in case of emergency.

My point is people have to weigh the pros and cons of having guns in the house. Even with them, it's not 100% guaranteed safety. It's not always the solution to these problems. There are ways to defend yourself without them, calling the police and hoping for the best wasn't my advice."

Then. This fucking woman. Jumps up SCREAMING at the TV. Hot dog bits in her mouth fly everywhere. On my sketchbook. On my potstickers. On my fucking face. She's still fucking screaming at the football men, this sweet old lady calling football men ""whiny bitch boys"" and telling the football men through the TV to off themselves. 

There's hot dog bits on my face. I am frozen in fear and pure rage, since I got that misophonia problem and sensory overload problems. When I can see straight again, I fucking book it. Abandon the potstickers. I can hear her from the bathroom, and so can customers. Someone asked if there was a fight going on.

I’m saying this because I’m not the type to sugar coat and you need to know the risks outside of the usual risks for self harming. You could get fired. They can fire you for not being safe around food or even just selling items in general, and they can fire you for dangerous behavior at work without being concerned about your self harm, because ultimately it’s your responsibility. They don’t have to get you a therapist and it wouldn’t be discrimination at all. They would have every right. I know it gets hard, but cutting on the job around selling items is the stupidest place you could do it. Ask for a bathroom break at least. 


Losing your job would only make this shit worse. Seriously, there are other ways to feel pain and there are other places to feel it. The usual “hey don’t hurt yourself, it’s bad for u :(“ talks don’t work on people like us, so I won’t give it even though I want to, but if you have to cut for the love of god don’t do it around sellable items, and getting blood on the floor is a fucking biohazard. STOP. 


I’m not trying to make u feel bad but please understand the magnitude of this. Even if you’re not cutting super bad, you’re using a blade you use to open packages (possible contamination), you’re going back to work with open wounds (possible contamination), and you’re getting blood on things (the floor, definite contamination). You’re also using company tools to harm yourself (fireable) and you’re putting customers and coworkers in danger (definitely fireable).


So stop. Take a bathroom break. Learn better coping mechanisms or at least don’t hurt yourself in a way that can directly and very seriously hurt others. You can snap a rubber band or pinch your arm. Even if you don’t have any infections or viruses, the company doesn’t know that, and they won’t take the time or money to test it so you can keep your job."
