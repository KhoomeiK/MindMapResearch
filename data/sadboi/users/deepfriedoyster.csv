I’ve been depressed for a long, LONG time - and this concept hurts in the best way.   I can honor and respect the weight of my emotions when it’s redirected with this perspective.  Just, thank you."
PMDD,fox37lc,t1_fowgd32,1588132996.0,Thank you 🙏 what you’re describing is what sounds like the next level I want to take.  Appreciate you laying out your process and how you take both of your feelings into consideration

PMDD,fa9ie28,t3_e7t6nr,1575874915.0,"Currently dealing with feelings like this at the moment.  😭😭 What I’ve been telling myself lately is that I know I’m not usually this sensitive, and I try my best to not take my feelings as seriously as they feel.  During the “good” parts of my cycle I know that things don’t bother me as much and I can more readily protect my boundaries.  But when it’s hell week my emotions are WAY more dramatic and if I’m alert enough to not totally identify with my feelings I try to treat myself like I’m someone ridiculous in a telenovela 😂 (“gasp... can you BELIEVE she said that to me??? ...I’m gonna knock over her coffee”)

Also welcome to your journey with PMDD, and great start on diving in and taking care of yourself"
