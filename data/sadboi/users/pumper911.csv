Hoboken,fos7oaf,t1_fool1aw,1588025462.0,Love it so far! The amenities shut down 3 weeks after I moved in but the building is like a luxury hotel.

Hoboken,fo41suz,t3_g5lfg3,1587496735.0,"I heard mixed things about Curry Up Now, but that's more fast food style Indian.

You'll probably need to venture to Jersey City. Uber Eats has a bigger delivery window than Seamless or other apps so you might be better off using them if you're going deep into JC.

I remember liking Deccan Spice and Paratha Junction.

When it opens back up, definitely check out Soul Curry. Their dishes aren't as traditional as Karma Kafe, but think it's significantly better."
Hoboken,fo0m8yq,t3_g4zlce,1587415661.0,"I've seen a TON of places wear employees are not wearing masks or pull it down where it's not even covering any of their faces.

Black Rail coffee does this all the time. Midtown Cheesesteaks employees were not wearing a mask. Playa Bowl wasn't for a while, but now I see them the last couple of times.

Honestly, I feel like more places are not wearing masks (or have them pulled down) than are complying."

Hoboken,fmt93yp,t1_fmsu9r5,1586368837.0,"Here are some of my favorites that are opened:

**Pizza:**

* Tenth Street Pizza - the best in Hoboken and most people would agree
* Frankie & Ava's - not everyone agrees here, but I think they have an outstanding square pie.
* Napoli's - best vodka pizza in Hoboken
* Gramalid's, Apulia, & Johnny Pepperoni's - they just fall outside of the above, but are very solid

**American:**

* Zack's - based on what's opened right now, would put them as my favorite, but Antique is the best overall in Hoboken.
* Halifax - very under the radar - in the W Hotel, but delicious food.

**Italian Deli:**

* Fiore's - roast beef special is out of this world. Not sure if they are still offering it.
* Vito's - along with Fiore's and Losurdo's (the latter is closed), they are the elite in Italian Deli's in Hoboken.

**Additional Places I Love:**

* Anthony David's - haven't had their Italian, but love their benedicts
* Bagels on the Hudson - probably the best bagels in Hoboken
* Carpe Diem - best wings in Hoboken
* Chicken Factory - like Bon Chon - not as good, but very very close
* Gogi Grill - very good make your own Korean bowl place
* Honeygrow - very good make your own noodle / rice type of bowl place.
* La Isla - there are a ton of Cuban spots, but this is probably the best
* Makai Poke - favorite poke in Hoboken
* Mamoun's - very very cheap Mediterranean place, but also very delicious
* Midtown Philly Steaks - terrible for you, but I love their cheesesteaks
* Orale - my favorite Mexican spot in Hoboken
* Otto Strada - probably my favorite spot for pasta
* Playa Bowls - best acai bowl in Hoboken
* South Street Ramen - best ramen in Hoboken
* Tony Boloney's - this place is very hit or miss. They do bat shit crazy pizzas and subs. I do think the Ole' sub is very good and the Burrrata is an excellent pizza.
* Turning Point - probably my favorite benedict in Hoboken. Very good breakfast spot in general"

Hoboken,fmqi0pb,t1_fmqexyl,1586299998.0,"I know you're trolling, but I'll bite:

* The apps don't include every restaurant on this list
* The apps don't give you a simple alphabetized list of Hoboken-only eateries
* Some restaurants don't opt to be on all apps so even if say, 80% of the ones on the list are on an app, there isn't one that has all of them in aggregate.
* I listed ones that are closed so it’s easy for people to find their favorite place and see if it’s opened or closed.  Apps won’t do this
* You can do whatever the fuck you want - if you want to reference the list great! If not, I don't care. It seems like a good chunk of people liked it.
* Ironic to say I'm ""wasting time"" when you are ""wasting time"" responding and leaving comments on here.
* The apps WILL list closed restaurants, depending on the app even if you can't order from there.
* I don't like you"

Hoboken,fmmu5nv,t3_fw1bmh,1586212142.0,"I lived there from June 2017 through June 2018. I would never go back there.

**The Good:**

* Great location
* 24/7 concierge - Sue is great. The others are hit or miss
* Some apartments have a ridiculously good view of the city
* Apartments itself aren't bad - everything seemed mostly modern and very little issues that required maintenance.

**The Bad:**

* Some people viewed this as a ""good"", but the biggest con for me was that it felt like I was in a frat house. Beer cans and vomit in the elevators CONSTANTLY. I've had people start fights with me as I was walking my dog just because they were drunk.
* Feel like it's overpriced for what you get. Amenities included - nothing special compared to other buildings.
* If you have car, the garage spots are insanely small.
* Elevators are always broken. Maybe they fixed it but was terrible when I was there.
