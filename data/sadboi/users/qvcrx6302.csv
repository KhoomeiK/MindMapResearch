Anxiety,epv2gtb,t3_bvxmtt,1559522506.0,"I do this, sort of, but mine is actually a yawn. That’s how I can help myself catch a deep breath when I am anxious. I realize it seems SO rude to be yawning in meetings, so I try to conceal it, but it’s massively helpful."
PanicAttack,epotlzs,t3_bvf8yf,1559353169.0,"I’m sorry to hear you’re experiencing this! Personally, I stopped drinking because I get so deeply depressed and anxious the day after if I’ve drank anymore than like 2-3 drinks. I feel misty better after 24 hours but the effects stay with me. But, it is different for everyone I’m sure.

Recently, though, I went against my own intentions and DID get drunk. A few hours into it, I got super sad and anxious and started crying for literally no reason. Now I literally never drink because it’s only good for like a few hours."
PanicAttack,ep9g81o,t3_bu6u2x,1559109610.0,"I am so glad to see this post. I absolutely have this and have even described it as a “hangover.” It’s really upsetting, especially when I go through a really good period but then get tripped up by one panic attack, because it feels like I’ve lost that progress. 

I want to add that I’m currently going through this as I had a panic attack two days ago. I had to leave work early today because I just felt so wrong and on the verge of tears.

It’s really tough. I hope you can get some rest, take care of yourself, and most importantly be kind with yourself. You are not alone."
