You are never old enough to learn new things and start from scratch. You may feel hopeless or even ""late"" to change your current situation, but believe me, you still have lots of years to becoming a better version of yourself.
Don't focus on your age or on what has happened. It's already in the past. Thinking of that consumes and sucks every amount of drive you're trying to build from now on. Leave the past in a box, lock it and throw the key away.
Have you thought of learning stuff like programming? There are many platforms where you can earn certifications that would help you build your own set of skills and eventually you could find a job or even make your own one. 
Now if you'd rather pursue something different from a college I think you should do this:

1. Try to study math through YouTube, khan Academy, books, etc. Start with the basics. Arithmetic, Algebra, geometry, trigonometry. It will take time of course, but I think it's necessary for any admission test you will take in the future.

2. Study something you are interested in because sometimes doing something just because I need to it's not the best decision.

I recommend you not to get stressed out about this friends thing. People come and go like cars on the roads. Some will stay with you for a while then disappear, some will stay only at the beginning and some will remain with you.
What I'm trying to convey is that college already gives a lot of stress, depression, anxiety especially when you're not a brilliant student like me so adding more problems isn't a good idea.
Just be yourself 100% of the time. Never change in order to fit in and don't do things you don't want to do so that people like you.

You need to become more careless about whether they are around or not. I know loneliness is hard to deal with but when the company is not a good one, it's better to be just by your own. Invest that energy in something that will be fruitful in the future. Try learning something through the internet or perfect a skill, wherever you end up studying remember it's the student and not the place you are in. Give your best shot because yourself deserves what you once wished to accomplish and experience. It's not easy. It's f***ing hard.
