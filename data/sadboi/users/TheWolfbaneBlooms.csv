Granted, it's not the best option for people who have kids or other responsibilities; but, if you have the ability to move to LA (or a similar film hub) and you CHOOSE not to, it's like shooting yourself in the foot at the starting line.

If you are determined to work in an industry, you go to where that industry is. It's literally the same for almost ANY other job. 

Do you think world-class chefs want to open/run a restaurant in the middle of nowhere? A cook might, but I don't think you'll find a whole lot of chefs interested. 

If you're in fashion, you go to NYC, Paris, Milan. 

If you're in tech, you'll likely want to be in Tokyo, Bay Area/Silicon Valley, London.

If you want to work in the film industry, it's going to be a lot harder if you're staying in a rural area, suburb, or somewhere else that doesn't have an active film industry. Otherwise, I suggest you figure out a way to start doing your own productions. Maybe someone will see something and you'll get an offer good enough to move.

But, on the bright side, almost every country has some kind of film industry."

If you're waiting months for a response, you're doing something wrong. I don't think I've ever heard of anyone responding months later with interest. You may receive a form letter of the ""we're not interested"" variety, but I've never heard anyone getting a call months later. 

At Sony, I don't think scripts lasted in our possession longer than 2 weeks. They'd either be tossed by the gate reader (me) or by the next 2-3 people after me. (Or, on very rare occasions, they'd actually get to someone who can make them.) 

---

Also, the problem is, this ""guaranteed response"" isn't a guarantee. Most of them actually aren't reading with interest. I know people who have been a part of it. I was asked to be once a few years back (and turned it down because I think that kind of business is morally reprehensible). 

Like I said in an earlier post... a lot of ""producers"" agree to accept a certain amount of scripts as part of the pitching program (so that they can get money). It really does not mean they're even reading them, let alone actually interested.

I think they end up doing more damage than people realize. Writers view these ""shortcuts"" as a trick into the industry when, really, there aren't any tricks to getting in. It's talent, hard work, drive, and lasting power.

I truly think the last one is the most important. You may not even get a nibble for years, but if you're really determined and you stick with it, that's your chance.

The time and money wasted for these contests, pitch festivals, and other (most often) scams could be better spent in other ways. 

Save that money to move to LA if you're not local. Or invest in a filmmaking class at a local school so you can learn some technical skills (since, honestly, writing isn't always the first way in). Spend that time applying to jobs in the industry that you may (or may not) be qualified for. 

There are so many better ways to spend time & money than on these contests that will almost NEVER help. 

If your career isn't guaranteed after winning/being selected for something like Nicholls, Sundance, or another reputable program, then these pitch fests likely aren't going to help. If you have the talent and the drive, you'll find a better way in."
Screenwriting,fp2fuew,t1_fp2dol1,1588261038.0,"I've heard of one (minor) success story out of hundreds of stories. The word on the street is that these pitch fests make deals with SOME of the people on there to accept a certain amount of ""pitches"" to be heard so that writers keep spending money thinking they have a shot.

Other sites, like InkTip do something similar. You can upload your script and then you get a notification if someone reads it (like the black list but with less vetting). You'll often get a handful of ""industry reads"" the first couple weeks of Inktip, which will usually make you pay for a second month. Then the reads dry up very quickly."
Screenwriting,fp2fkg1,t1_fp1rjk1,1588260902.0,It's a way companies make money off screenwriters by forcing them to pay to do something they can do for free.
Screenwriting,fp2fbkg,t3_g9vybe,1588260779.0,"Start writing down the name, representative, and list of comparable movies (to what you write) of every screenwriter you want to be compared to (or consider yourself similar to).

I suggest you find writers that are relatively close to your level. If you haven't produced anything, look for writers within your genre that you think are comparable to you. Look for writers who may only have a couple of projects complete (but make sure they're relatively successful ones).

Once you have all that, start finding all the info on their reps. Make a list of their names, companies, phone numbers, email addresses, etc.

You can do the same for actors, directors, producers, etc., as well, depending on what stage of your career you're in.

\---

After you've done all that and you cancel IMDbPro (which, honestly, is not necessary until you're actually ready to start sending out material or are already actually working), you can use that info to write out queries to representatives.

In those queries, you can mention how they represent a similar writer and you believe your work could be marketed in a similar fashion. This proves you did some work/research and you know how to compare yourself.

That being said, I would not go on there and say, ""I'm a drama writer so I can be compared to Aaron Sorkin."" Because, honestly, unless you're a prodigy... you're not Sorkin. Often, an agent isn't going to compare a writer with no credits to someone with dozens.

Good luck!"
