The clinic were I went to therapy prescribed it and I was actually very hesitant to try it but it‚Äôs the best decision I‚Äôve ever made.

So now we have to suffer for the rest of our lives because we‚Äôre addicts. We deserve to be treated like the scum we are even while struggling with recovery.  Most people who are not even addicts become depressed and such when treated like they don‚Äôt matter. The difference is is addicts know if we self medicate we won‚Äôt give a shit so fucking much. 
There is a huge opiate epidemic and more than not they are treated like pieces of shit, can‚Äôt ever be trusted again, etc.   
How is that approach working out? It‚Äôs not. 
Have some empathy and fucking compassion FFS. It goes a long way."

I know people are capable of shitty things when struggling with addiction but to continue to be treated like that when they are sober and really trying, is setting them up to fucking fail and fuck them when they relapse right.

AskReddit,ew3h6i2,t3_cml30t,1565078686.0,"I lived in a haunted house for about six years. My step daughters room had the most activity. She would run down the stairs all spooked and we slept downstairs pretty often. 

One day I was washing dishes and saw someone  walk from the carport door out the back door and even went look to see who the fuck just walked through my house. Just a scary shadow, it was more solid than what was normally seen. 

My mother in law saw a man in overalls one night. 

Random objects would jump from the tv stand and shelves. 

One night I was heading upstairs in the dark. As I turned down the hall I had the feeling of being ran up on by a presence which scared the fuck outta me. I ran too fast down the stairs in socks, slipped and fell square on my ass down each fucking step. 
I cussed that mofo out but slept downstairs for a couple of weeks cuz fuck shit! I kept telling this spirit that they can go to the light FFS. Stubborn ass didn‚Äôt want any peace I suppose. 

My husband worked offshore 28/14 so he gone more than home. One of his friends stayed with us for a while, he was a pretty chill dude and mostly kept to himself. 

Me and my girls took a little vacay so he had the house to himself for a week or so. When we came home he wasn‚Äôt there, didn‚Äôt think much of it. A day or two later he comes in acting really skittish. 

He‚Äôs like, ‚Äú How the fuck do you stay in this house? I was hearing noises and seeing shadows...I was too scared to be here alone so I went stay at my moms‚Äù. 

Bruh! You a grown ass man, are you serious? 
Indeed he was. 

At one point I bought a digital recorder but chickened out. I had to live there and had no desire to hear any spooky ass shit. I never was so scared I had to leave. I was only genuinely scared that one night I busted my ass. Everybody asked me if I was pushed. No I was not, just a klutz with a terrible escape plan. 

Me and hubby eventually went our separate ways. I stayed friends with my neighbor who would often chat with the new owners of the house. 

One night she noticed he had been sitting in his car for a long time. She checked to see if he was okay and he said he was too scared to go in the house and was waiting for his girlfriend to come home.  I guess this spirit fucked with dudes really hard...grown fucking men didn‚Äôt want to stay there alone. Dayum. 

I was finally able to meet the new owner and we shared stories. He confirmed the room with the most activity and all the spooky shit that went down. It was nice to have such a crazy experience Validated by multiple people. 

The house I have now is nice and quiet. No spooks but nothing interesting either. Now that my girls are older they talk about that house a lot and as creepy as it was we all loved it. I was oddly more curious than scared, it was kinda like an adventure really.  I wouldn‚Äôt want to share my space like that again but it was trippy and I‚Äôm glad I got to experience it."

BipolarReddit,ew18cmw,t3_cl5oua,1565017601.0,"I was really bummed when I learned my awakenings were hypomania. I really thought I was experiencing metaphysical shit, the feeling was so strong and real what else could it be. Finding like minded people who understood and validated what I was going through really solidified it.
 
I hallucinated the coolest shit! I was thrown into the universe. It‚Äôs was so vast and beautiful. It‚Äôs something I will carry with me forever regardless if it was real or not. I still experienced it. 
I‚Äôve seen my daughter astral projection watching cartoons of all things lol. 

My longest episode was fucking amazing. That energy tho omfg! I was seeing auras and felt soooo connected. I could manifest sparklies and glow during meditation. That feeling was so strong it had to be i was reaching a higher state of consciousness.  One day I woke up and it was over. I was so depressed and couldn‚Äôt figure out where I went wrong. 

I went to therapy a few years later. I was put on lexapro which threw me into a manic episode so intense I was almost put on mandatory obs. I was so freaking horny I was uncomfortable and didn‚Äôt feel fit for public. I had not a fucking clue what was going on. Thankfully I had a therapy session and asked her,‚Äù Is this what my sexual peak is supposed to feel like. I feel like a cat in heat and it‚Äôs starting to freak me out...it won‚Äôt stop and I can‚Äôt do anything about it‚Äù.  She asked me some questions the last one if I would mind if she brought in the NP for her opinion. That moment I was told I was experiencing mania and was asked had I felt this way before was such a Ohhhh FUCKING HELL , REALLY?!?!  THIS is mania?  Ya I have, just never this intense and never for this many consecutive hours....ohhhhh damn...this absolutely makes more sense than what I thought was going on...I thought it was my vibration getting higher...well, fuck!  Cue existential crisis. 

I remember reading Ram Dass (I forget which book). He mentions that humans are not meant to stay in a high vibrational state or we will go insane. He said his brother refused to leave that space and he was sectioned for quite some time.  Remembering to come back to reality and stay grounded every so often helped him stay out of hospitals. I thought that was really interesting. 

It really fucked with my head to find out the happiest times in my life were anything but. The thought that if I stay on medicine would take that away forever, totally devastated me. 

It took me a while to process it all. Regardless of how my awakening came about, I still very much experienced something amazing. I‚Äôve seen and felt things that most people wouldn‚Äôt even dream of. I‚Äôve been very lucky to have so far only experienced euphoria. I‚Äôm in debt and very much an emotional mess who probably will never get my shit together. But those good times, were really fucking good! It‚Äôs been such a wild ride and i can say I truly lived my life. Idk if I would‚Äôve taken so many chances if I were neurotypical. I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed till mid 40‚Äôs. My life finally makes more sense and I‚Äôm not quite so hard on myself anymore. I had to find some kind of silver lining in all this. I‚Äôve also told those closest to me if I start talking about spiritual shit, it might be a sign I need help."

BipolarReddit,ew0yjp5,t3_cm7ggd,1565010349.0,"It‚Äôs ridiculous really. They seem to forget very quickly that we will cycle through moods often, even if we do take meds, the name of the disorder itself should explain that. Show any justifiable, normal emotion and they think we are in crisis. This was my experience, it‚Äôs long and I will try to make it as concise as I can. 

An EX friend of mine (of 27 years) would cry from her bleeding heart how something needs to be done about mental illness and suicide. Now we live in the Bible Belt and many people think this way and are very vocal and righteous. 

I was having a hard time trying to heal from a abusive relationship. I sought therapy, became manic from the lexapro which led to my diagnosis in my 40‚Äôs. I had a lot to process in  a short period of time and it was overwhelming. First off she tells me I was misdiagnosed, she didn‚Äôt see me as Bipolar, it‚Äôs something worse. 
Huge red flag that I dismissed, she has been a know it all since we‚Äôve met. 

I was socializing and getting back into a routine. Just wanting to get out of bed was a huge deal for me and I was feeling much better. 
I learned about boundaries and toxic people a few months prior to this so subtle things I would normally brush off or accept made me take a step back and truly observe our dynamic. 

I would be open and honest like she asked of me to be told, IDK what I‚Äôm talking about, this is how you should be feeling/ doing/ living. 
Excuse me?! I‚Äôm shutting that shit down, I‚Äôm not letting you dictate my life like this. 
She did not take this very well at all and so the fuckery escalated.

She would ‚Äúbust my balls‚Äù telling everybody who visited how crazy and over emotional I am, so I set the boundary (first time ever, yay me) that is not a joke and it‚Äôs very hurtful. This stops now or my over emotional ass will exit your life. 

I think she took this as a fucking challenge. I knew she was opinionated and had a strong personality but was not prepared for this shit. I no longer listened to her words and she talked a really good game, but her actions spoke volumes. I knew for sure what her intentions were despite what she said. 

She posted passive aggressive shit on social media about her friend the snowflake who is offended by EVERYTHING and can‚Äôt take a joke or accept other people‚Äôs opinions...because after hearing someone say some really foul, racist shit I said ‚Äúomg, there are so many things wrong with that‚Äù. 

She shocked me with what is very much white supremacist type shit  that was so opposite of how she portrayed herself in public I‚Äôm still just completely mind fucked. 

This was not okay. You are fake as fuck and any respect I ever had for you is gone, this shit is Unacceptable.
This of course was taking away her freedom of speech, I‚Äôm close minded and intolerant, so argumentative and she is mortified by this change in me. 

I. Just. Can‚Äôt. 

This is an absolute deal breaker and we‚Äôve obviously grown too far apart and toxic asf. (I‚Äôm pretty sure she has some kind of savior complex and really thinks she is helping people who are ungrateful and have no loyality)

Then she really lost her shit. 

Her: You don‚Äôt try hard enough. 

Me:  I‚Äôve come a long way and I‚Äôm actually doing much better. I‚Äôm not in bed all day, I‚Äôm cleaning and socializing. I‚Äôm functioning very well and in the middle of processing being newly diagnosed and the realization of the trauma that molded the mess that is me, I quit a 10 year fucking opiate addiction which in itself is a huge victory. 

Her:  You think that even matters? Look how long it took you to quit. Do you really think you are doing good now, you think you deserve kudos for doing what you were supposed to in the first place?! You need to stop feeling sorry for yourself and get your shit together. You boo hoo about this dude that YOU let into YOUR life. YOU saying your proud of yourself for finally kicking him out is stupid,you have NOTHING to be proud of.  Who lets themselves be abused like that?  (This has to be a tactic toxic ppl use to confuse you, it‚Äôs such a mind fuck to hear) 

Me:  Are you shitting me right now? I‚Äôm supposed to be here for support, a little validation would‚Äôve went a long way. 

Her:  ohhhh..the baby wants me to hold her hand and be coddled?!? Your problems would go away if you would just suck it up and get over this already. I‚Äôm the only one who tells you the truth and you can‚Äôt handle that. I have been nothing but supportive and I‚Äôm your biggest cheerleader. All this shit is in your head and you are all of a sudden argumentative, angry and your scaring me. You‚Äôve changed so much. 
 
I left shortly after that and went no contact. She slandered me on social media and to who ever would listen really. Said  I was sick in the head and delusional. Two people cared enough to check on me, they were really worried by how unhinged I was and saw I was doing great, calling her out on her bullshit. They are no longer in her life either. 

It‚Äôs scary to think where I would be had I fully trusted her. My delusions are spiritual in nature not paranoid like she tried to convince everyone, myself included. I know to seek help when I start having an awakening and gaining ‚Äúsuper powers‚Äù(what a bummer finding out that wasn‚Äôt real üòØ)  Had I not known about gaslighting I probably would‚Äôve questioned myself. 

I‚Äôm a very private and guarded person now. 

Most ppl can sympathize with depression but start talking about the other shit that comes along with it and it‚Äôs too much. 

They seem to come to their own conclusions instead of actually listening to the person going through it. They also seem to think being Bipolar means we are always unwell and bat shit insane 24/7. Express Any emotion at all and that is met with concern and questions of well being. 

But can‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so hard for us to talk about it. Sigh....

It‚Äôs not like there is a wealth of fucking legit information on this very subject available at their fingertips or anything! It‚Äôs frustrating to know they have clear and precise articles on what to DO and what NOT to do when supporting a friend struggling. Still it eludes them."

My ex would tell me about his journeys on shrooms and how certain entities seemed to be very curious of him. The only thing I could think of is, aren‚Äôt you very curious of them also? How often is it that they get to interact with this strange being suddenly manifesting in their space.

A loving creator who will damn you to ETERNAL torture and hellfire for the most bullshit reasons is so far from a loving and accepting concept it‚Äôs a mind fuck.  

IMO, an atheist that has morals and is a good person is more genuine. They do good simply because they are good and empathetic and truly care for no other reason than they don‚Äôt wanna be a dick. There is no reward for them nor is there a punishment.  If you are only a decent person because you are fearful of hellfire and brimstone then you should really sit down with yourself and think about that.

This is not acceptance and a blatant disrespect and TBH, it‚Äôs so fake. 

Just think for a moment what it would feel like to be to be told, ‚Äú I love you but, I don‚Äôt agree with who you are as a person..let‚Äôs continue to hang out tho because I‚Äôm willing to tolerate you anyway‚Äù.  You can try to justify that all you want but it‚Äôs bullshit. 

OP, you are not obligated to stay friends someone who shits on people for existing. This is not simply a difference of opinion, this is deep, imbedded morals that you don‚Äôt want to compromise. 

IMO, this speaks volumes about your character and good on you. Always be unapologetically true to yourself. I also chose to die on this hill and will never bend for anyone. How fake and hypocritical would I be if I stayed close friends with someone stood for the very thing I stand against. 

I couldn‚Äôt imagine being friends someone who believed that me simply BEING made me wrong, immoral, sinful, etc. in any way shape form.  That is not acceptance and it‚Äôs fucked up."
