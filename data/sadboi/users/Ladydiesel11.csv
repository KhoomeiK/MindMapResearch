My partner after that threatened to come back and kill me after he left me because ""I wasn't obeying"". So yeah, next bf would not leave my house when we ended things. I punched him in the face. Few years later my partner left me alone on bourbon street because I was trying to safely get a coworker back to her hotel and we ""were asking for it"". He then got lost and I had to find and get everyone home safe and he blamed it on me. I punched him in the face and choked him. Before PTSD treatment I punched my current partner in the face when he left me alone in Tijuana at the border.
