I most definitely apologized. I’m glad I came to this page because I didn’t even think of giving her a gift that reflects her culture would be offending🙁 god I feel like such an idiot. Thanks for your response.
Fungalacne,fdfnfns,t1_fdfjgbw,1578365740.0,It’s not nearly as inflamed now that I’ve been using the honey and aloe. For some reason it gets really bad after I drink alcohol :/ and eat sugar so I’ve been doing my best to steer clear.. except for the occasions I accept my fate for the next day if I know I’m gonna drink. Should I give the soolantra a try? What do you think? I could send pics of my face if that helps
