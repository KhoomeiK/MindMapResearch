100thieves,flymnfs,t1_flxtngi,1585605013.0,"i think the main reason 100T doesn‚Äôt have a franchise spot is because the buy in was like $25 million and nade didn‚Äôt really see a good ROI in entering into this league. There was also a weird thing about if you franchise you can‚Äôt use the 100T name and nade didn‚Äôt want to call a city their home because he wants everyone worldwide to feel connected to the team. faze got around it by calling their team ATL Faze so they aren‚Äôt necessarily Faze Clan but a new entity that has like a ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù with the franchised team. i think he‚Äôs been making really good investments, focusing more on content creation (which is where i‚Äôm sure a ton of their income comes from) and building the cash app compound."

i guess flamers are always going to be there and i need to just mute everyone at the start of the game. i never thought of how high ranked people could be playing mid and by playing rank i‚Äôm actually playing with people around the same skill set as me."

I‚Äôm not too mad about that because I know there is still a lot to learn and I‚Äôm basically looking to get some kind of baseline. I have a quick couple of questions. 

1. Should I learn a secondary role before I jump into ranked or should I just dodge when I‚Äôm not assigned my role (I‚Äôm a support main right now)

2. Should I look to get comfortable with other champions to expand my champion pool (I main Nami but I have played a decent amount of song and soraka. I have also picked up champs like thresh and Leona but I‚Äôm not comfortable enough to play them ranked.)

3. Do you have any tips to keep myself a bit more passive in lane / tips for better positioning. (I find myself either over extending if I‚Äôm trying to poke and it will usually result in me getting killed)

4. Any other general tips I should know for ranked."
