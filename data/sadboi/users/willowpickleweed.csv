Also, depersonalization/derealization and aggressiveness could be symptoms of clinical depression (I have all of those during my depressive episodes), in this case it could be relatively easy to find proper treatment. I don’t wanna downplay depression AT ALL but in most cases it’s easier to threat than Bipolar, borderline and schizophrenia especially.

I was also guilt tripped a lot but when the new doctor took the time to listen to me carefully and drew the conclusion that the meds I was on weren’t good for me, he changed my prescription and things started to be okay. When I next saw my therapist I was completely honest, I said that if I’d stayed under the first doctors’ care I would’ve killed myself and just like that the bitch was never brought up again.

This is to say that seeing another doctor is your right, and that the new doctors’ best interest will be your mental health, not his colleagues’ ego. 
These are professionals you are paying, put your foot down and demand the services. And if it’s all the same network your therapist should fucking help you out too.

Cutting down is a very good start, I did it too. I got to 3/4 cigarettes a day then 1 then I decided to stop, it was just willpower and damn hard. 
I didn’t smoke for a week when my dog got sick and I was so worried that I smoked one outside the vet and.... I didn’t enjoy it? I didn’t find it disgusting, I just realized that it wasn’t making me feel any better and my lungs couldn’t take it so I threw half of it. The day after I could still smell it on my clothes and the thought that non smokers smell it all the time, idk it’s kinda freaky and I don’t wanna have that smell on me so I quit for real. I also started to exercise everyday and I really feel the difference in my endurance.

Tbh this lockdown situation makes it quite easy for me, I’m scared of going back to normal life cause my country has huge smoking culture so I’m going to be around smokers all the time. 
In the end it’s just one “no” at the time, one hour, one day until it’s your new normal. 

Do be afraid of giving it a try. There’s no failing, no shame in relapsing. Every day without smoking is an healthier day in your life. Good luck!"

bipolar,fnw8e7l,t1_fnw5sie,1587313482.0,"I understand, I used to smoke every night for the same reason. What I realized is that weed is an illusion, it makes you comfortable with just being there. It’s harder to find things that you actually enjoy, like books, movies, drawing or cooking but when you do it’s much more fulfilling. I was smoking because I didn’t want to be there and that’s a huge problem so I’m fixing that instead of numbing myself. It’s not always easy but getting physically tired helps so I exercise almost every day. 

Also, I thought weed was good for my sleep but it was actually part of the insomnia problem. The first two weeks after I stopped it was hard to fall asleep but then I got used to sleep without it and I realized that I created myself the psychological need to be high in order to fall asleep.

I feel like weed is some sort of bitchy toxic friend, it’s there to solve problems that it create itself."
