I have been picking up on Tuesdays for a while without issues until last week when I went to the clinic on Tuesday and no one was there. I literally started to panic as I have never missed a dose before. 

Found out last minute (no call to me or anything) on their website due to COVID-19, they are open for dosing and take homes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday - any days in between those, the clinic will be closed. People who come every day has to get take homes for Tuesday & Thursday. I was shocked because I checked their website a day prior and no update and I received no call informing me to pick up on Monday instead of of my normal Tuesdays. This change was very last minute.

Long story short, I ended up going to the ER near me to see if a doctor could have written out an emergency dose at a pharmacy until Wednesday.  He couldn’t , even with my lockbox full of empty take homes of 2 whole weeks. He ended up prescribing me Clonodine. Luckily, the withdrawals weren’t that bad, but the RLS started to kick in and it reminded me of those days being off the pills and Heroin. 

It seems that due to the virus, they are shutting down the clinics on the weekends nationwide, which in turn giving people who came everyday take homes for Saturday & Sunday."

I have Crohns Disease and on Methadone maintenance and Miralax was the only thing that worked for me out of 10 different brands combined of stool softeners; magnesium citrate; milk of magnesia, etc.

I usually mix the Miralax with water or Gatorade, or basically with anything liquid once or twice a day since it’s tasteless and I am able to go every day or every other day opposed to once a week prior when I use to get my constipation episodes. 

Also, you’re able to take it everyday without any side effects since it’s an osmotic laxative.

Mine were so bad that I would have to call 911 to take me to the hospital from keeling over in abdominal pain from straining so hard. 

There were times that I literally passed out on the toilet and woke up dry heaving from the pain of not being able to poop - I don’t wish that on my worst enemy.

Methadone,fidnvlz,t3_f7qd4g,1582369244.0,"I live in Georgia and have been in Methadone maintenance for 2 years now. 

The first clinic I went to was Crossroads Treatment Center located in Sandy Springs GA until that particular facility was shut down early last year. They allowed me to take my Klonopin prescription; however, I had to jump through a lot of hoops - it took about 2-3 weeks for official approval from my personal doctor and the clinic’s doctor’s correspondence with each other. The random UA’s ramped up as well than the typical patient.

When I transferred to Brand New Start Methadone Clinic in Dallas, GA, they were a bit lenient on the benzo prescriptions. I also ended up being diagnosed with ADHD and was prescribed Adderall 10mg IR as well. The doctor there approved both prescriptions in less than 48 hours. Been on all 3 (Methadone; Klonopin Adderall) ever since albeit closely monitored.

I know there are a lot of facilities that are really strict and some just don’t allow that combination at all, especially with the new regulations popping up all over the nation. I think it’s safe to call ahead and ask to speak to a doctor and inquire about it - some will tell you straight away if they will allow it or not. If you can get your prescribing doctor to personally coordinate with the methadone clinic’s doctor, it’s a major plus."

Methadone,fegd2xh,t1_feasj9f,1579088326.0,"I believe at the majority of clinics (well, all the ones in GA), you only can jump up 5 -10mg (20 being the cap per week) every couple of days until you are stabilized with your preferred mg. 

It took me about 4 and a half months to stabilize at 120mg starting from the starting dose of 30mg. There were times I didn’t request an increase for a week or 2 because I thought it  was lasting a full 24 hours before experiencing any withdrawal symptoms (hot, cold flashes, etc.) but that was short lived. When I felt like the methadone wasn’t holding me over the 24 hours after a single dose around 90-105mg anymore, I started to put in requests for an increase.

After a lot of trial and error with taking methadone and understanding my body’s metabolism rate, I feel 120mg is my sweet spot after being on it for 7 months now. It lasts more than 24 hours after a single dose and don’t feel withdrawal symptoms until around the 42 hour mark. 

Just monitor how your body reacts after 12-16 hours after dosing at your current mg and work your way up until you stabilize at your sweet spot. You’ll eventually find it and probably stay on it until you start to taper off of it."
Methadone,fegb5lw,t1_fea7952,1579085857.0,"Trust me, I know exactly what you’re talking about. 

One time I came to my clinic 15 minutes after it opened (5:30AM is when they open) to dose for the day and restock on my 2 week take-homes and went to go stand in line per my usual routine, it was about 20-25 people ahead of me that day for the first time in a VERY long time - I guess the clinic was short on nurses and their system was acting up. 

Not even 2 minutes roll by after checking in and standing in line with all those people, the nurse out of nowhere yelled out my number, “504!!!” - my entire face went pale and was shocked because I knew (being at multiple clinics) that people at these clinics DO NOT PLAY about their position in line. The look on all those people faces that were waiting since opening felt like an ALL-OUT riot was about take place any moment. A guy then proceeds yell at the top of his lungs “WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS, HE LITERALLY JUST WALKED IN”. 

The amount of huffing and puffing and the lip smacking with big OL’ wide eyes eyeing you up & down as I was walking past all those people was absolutely crazy - as if it was my fault they had to take care of all the weekly take-homes first before single dosing due the short staff on nurses and system crashing."
Methadone,feg9a4e,t1_fedqcss,1579083215.0,"Believe it or not, I actually dose 120mg once a day and it works perfectly for me as it actually holds me over a full 24 hours with 0 withdrawal symptoms.  I dose at 5 AM and don’t dose again until next day 5 AM on the dot until I have to restock on take homes and dose at the clinic at 5:30 AM when the clinic opens. 

I really think I hit my sweet spot with 120 mg - it’s been about 7 months now and don’t have to increase or decrease.

I’m on phase 5 at my Dallas, GA clinic (18 months) and have 2 week take-homes."

Ghosts,f3wul6q,t3_dimwnb,1571222002.0,"Kent’s videos on GOCM is some of the most authentic material of paranormal activity that exists within the YouTube world or ever... 

I have been watching his videos for 2 years now. If you get to know Kent, you will know he doesn’t have the type of time to pull off “pranks”, etc like you see with a good portion of “paranormal” youtubers - his personality also reflects that as well. He doesn’t. care about “followers” and “popularity”. He’s straight to the point and takes his time with the evidence he comes across. He also has proof to back up the evidence and the particular spirits he comes across via property and town records and the deaths that occurred in the 1800s-1900s.

My main reason of following his paranormal journey 2 years ago was the way he takes his time to build trusting relationships with the spirits that lingers in his house and the town of Carmel, Maine.  Building those relationships allows him to  put together the stories of the spirits from the early 1800s to late 1900s .  That trust allows Kent to have full-on dialogue with the spirits and allow more activity to happen around him. They talk to him through his spirit box and guide him to hidden stuff around the house and town, leading him to old documents; old treasure (coins, etc); and human remains that was buried under his house (his house use to be a morgue/funeral home). He also helps some of the spirits move on or some would say “finding the light”. It’s amazing to see the living interacting with the afterlife. 

The evidence of his that still haunts me to this day is the spirit he calls “Shadow Dude”. That video alone made me a believer in the paranormal. So many questions than answers in that one video.

He use to keep comments open on his YouTube channel; however, someone was spreading his home address all over his public videos. He ultimately disabled the comments on his channel - it was either that or he would have stopped posting on YT. You guys can follow his FaceBook account as Kent & his wife are very active with his followers and we discuss the evidence he collected with his recent paranormal investigations. 

New video next week!"

I went on methadone maintenance on April 13th, 2018 and still on it until this day. I have been clean from all illicit drugs since being on methadone for 498 days now. I learned that I was having concentration issues in college and seeked out a psychiatrist around January 2019. The psychiatrist gave me a ADHD test and I was diagnosed with ADHD (I’m 24 years old). 

He asked me about my methadone maintenance and I was honest. All he did was call up my methadone clinic to coordinate the treatment between him and the clinic and he wrote out a script for Vyvanse. I tried it out for a week and it wasn’t for me.  By my next appointment I was put on Adderall 10MG x2 a day and been on it ever since.

I know your case may not go the way mine did, but it’s extremely possible, especially being honest and showing you aren’t abusing  drugs like before. 

I will always be an addict and I will always crave opiates/Heroin, but I learned that there are other ways to cope and be responsible when on other medication. 

I’m in Georgia, btw."
