2. He did play favorites with his son's *cough* Horus *cough*

3. Seeing as how he saw fit to put Horus in charge of the largest miltary operation in human history up to that point he probably could have shared the whole webway idea with him which would have made Horus less of an edgy ""daddy left me because he thinks bureaucrats are more important"" bitch

4. Back to the whole playing favorites thing. Had he just killed Horus at the start of their fight on the Vengeful Spirit instead of pulling his punches he could have walked away with probably only minor injuries if any injuries at all

5. If he wouldn't have been the largest hypocrite in the galaxy at the Council of Nikaea and instead educated Magnus on the safest way for him and his legions to do warp shenanigans than the whole Magnus turning traitor could have been possibly avoided

6. Warp drives and gellar fields were created during or just before the dark age of technology they didn't get invented during the age of strife when warp storms isolated the human race across the galaxy

7. He could have definitely shared the bare minimum about chaos/warp-spawn with the primarchs only thereby educating them to the potential underlying threat that existed throughout the galaxy especially since it's presumed that the Interex human civilization from the book Horus Rising have a fairly decent understanding of Chaos as a whole and thereby take steps to protect themselves from potential corruption

Edit: Mortarion hating the Emperor is Big E's own fault and due to the Emperor's vast experience/age/knowledge he should have known the massive display of psychic, technological, and military might not to mention the sheer presence of his being would have caused people to worship him as a deity seeing as how humans tend to gravitate towards beings of immense power and tend to consider them as divine"
