I've been considering a coordinated trade with my husband so that I can get her back easy peasy lol. I really hope they'll patch this somehow in the future.

I'm another on the Rocket train  She was one of my initial villagers, and is so snarky and acts inconvenienced when I talk to her more than once in a day.

ACTrade,fozca1h,t3_gaddlw,1588188251.0,"I absolutely adore Audie. I happened across her during my first few mystery island runs, and she was the first villager to join my island (after the initial two). She's such a pop star! She's sweet, and fabulous. She was calling me bestie by the end of her first day on my island and is constantly giving me the prettiest DIY recipes. She's making up words, like I often do in my own life. This is my first AC, and I just learned her backstory the other night (story on it [here](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-04-03-animal-crossing-grandma-reacts-to-character-named-after-her-in-new-horizons) if anyone is interested!) and now I love her even more."
ACTrade,fozarj0,t3_ga9r2m,1588187529.0,"Aww, what a thoughtful way to celebrate your dad. And my condolences on your loss as well... These days especially, I think so much about the message you're sharing, that you really should appreciate the special people in your life and make sure they know you love them... 

My dad is a notorious (I say that lightly, because I love it) word-creator. He just comes up with silly words that don't mean anything to anyone but us. My mom always rolls her eyes when he uses them naturally in conversation. She laughs at some of them, but doesn't really get that kind of humor. I, however, take after him and am all about the silliness. When I was maybe a sophomore or junior in high school, he and I were on a trip to town, maybe for groceries, probably to drop me off at drama club. Out of no where, he comes up with the word ""poppenstrash"". What does poppenstrash mean, you might ask? It took me a while to fully comprehend it myself. I had to ask him what the ""dictionary"" definition would be, haha. ""You know, it's like when the wind blows really hard and knocks the top of a flower over. It's also kinda like your room when it's messy, like a tiny hurricane blew through and poppenstrashed your whole room."" We had a good laugh over that. It seemed so ridiculous. But to this day, at 29 years old, we still frequently use this made-up word, among many others, in regular conversation, and my mom still rolls her eyes. My now husband gets to join in on the silliness, and he and I follow the same tradition of making up silly words ourselves. I love my dad for many reasons; I think he's where I got all my cheerfulness and silliness from. That being said, I think this memory is the one that best highlights my relationship with him."

Advice,f0vq1d5,t3_d6ee2x,1568988919.0,"I also have anxiety, and let me tell you, therapy will definitely help you to learn healthy coping mechanisms and live your life happier and more successfully. Despite your mom's views on the situation, I absolutely encourage you to find a therapist. Your primary care doctor can assist with this. If you don't want your mom or anyone else to know, you don't have to tell them. It's totally up to you who you share the information with! I've been attending therapy for at least a year now, and have chosen not the share that tidbit with my family for fears that they would be judgemental, so I absolutely understand where you're coming from there. And I'll also say that you fearing what your mom thinks about it is also likely related to your anxiety. I think that folks like us who struggle with this also tend to struggle with wanting to please people, and fearing what others will think. I'm proud of you for recognizing that your struggling with anxiety and wanting to do something about it, even when you have family who doesn't approve. Please know that there are many people like myself who know how helpful therapy can be and will always advocate for that. You can find support, and I believe you're already one step closer to managing your anxiety. Please take good care of yourself.
