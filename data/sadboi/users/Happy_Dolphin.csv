I was grabbing my stuff out of a locker when this woman, probably in her 40’s but really pretty, curvy and whatnot approached me. Apparently she failed to rent a locker from the machine because she only had cash. Her “son” had allegedly gone off with her wallet and credit cards so she asked if I could pay for her. In return she would “do anything” for me. 
Me being young and naive, doubted the validity of her story and turned the offer down. Not less than 5 minutes after walking away did I realize my open invitation and mistake. She kept insisting on “doing anything for me” in return and calling me a handsome young boy, giving flirty smiles at me.
