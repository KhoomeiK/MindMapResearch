depression,fdeie7p,t3_ekpvdz,1578339680.0,"Same. At the moment I’m afraid of the world. Idk, I watch too much news. Plus crap that happens in my own life. That and at the realization we’re fully committed to killing ourselves (as a planet.) idk why but I’m always nervous and scared that I will fuck up so bad that I will he killed...idk how to explain it exactly. Even with small decisions are making me spiral; if I have a soda I will have diabetes etc. and I normally don’t think this way. I got a girl atm but I’m worried she will cheat on me. That she will find the cracks in myself and peace out. I’m worried that my low sleep will kill me (I’m trying to wake up early but I can’t because of late night FOMO).
I’ve been working out for years but all of a sudden I’m getting doubts. I’m worried I will fuck up on a lift or that I’ll just stay stagnant. Hell I even got anxious and became so down after someone destroyed me on a FB group in which I disagreed with the OP on something I believed was closed minded. More and more I’m getting the feeling I don’t belong. I see people my age and everyone on social media is cold. It feels like everyone’s about “hustling” and everyone is a shark meanwhile I’m a whale. I’m worried about my finances, I’m worried about my credit score, I’m not even over the crap that’s happened in my life. 
Logically I can say this is all depression or something like that. But a part of me thinks I’m really not. That the world is becoming colder and colder. I don’t think I’m crazy or mental-for example earlier I heard a convo between two coworkers and all they said was, “HEY HOW ARE YOU?” “GOOD N YOU?” “GOOD” “THATS NICE” “THE WEATHER”
Oh god I’m losing my mind. I’m not ok."

I give up trying to feel wanted-fuck it if my dog wants me then I’m ok. I know I’m the shit, even if the world doesn’t. I’ve done things that are unique to myself and I know my worth. Everyone around me just has an idea of me but no one knows the story from start to finish. I know the random times I’ve missed my bus and I’ve been left stranded, or when I got the phone call my dad died, or when I had to figure out how I was going to get home after waking up in a hospital, or when I saw my ex hated me and I couldn’t get her back or when I sat outside by the harbor the first time I figured out how to sneak out of my house. Only me. Just me. Fuck everyone else. I can love but I’m done trying to make my life into this pretty picture. It’s not. I heard somewhere that American culture is all about overhyping things than they really are. Trust me, the movies and tv shows are all imaginary. There’s some truth but you’ll never see the ugly parts, where the character smells his own farts or picks his nose or when he lashes out in private into the unknown or the moments where you sit by the harbor inches from the dark waters. Live for yourself and if anyone joins, all the better. Fuck society, I AM the center of the universe. I am better therefore I should bless the world with my amazing self. It sounds selfish, but I’ve been selfless for so fucking long. I’m not going to hide and pretend that I’m some perfect saint.
