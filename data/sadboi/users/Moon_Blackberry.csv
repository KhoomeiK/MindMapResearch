Lets just say that it was watery and some went down the side of the trash. My friend was apparently the only one who saw this. She asked her mom if she saw what the old lady did, and she saw the part on the trash that dribbled down and said ""oh wait let me clean this up"" and proceeded to take her finger and wipe it.

(Which were basically go to a trainer and keep up the consistent training 24/7 or give her up because apparently if we can’t do that it’s quite obvious that they can’t be trained to the extent that they could have plus you are neglecting them) . The biggest problem in my plate though is all my sisters pointing fingers at me when I say hey you need to stop neglecting her or let me have my medical equipment and then they get mad at me and say that I just want to get rid of her dog so I can get mine (me literally feeding her dog and giving it water and taking it out and trying to train it so it can have a better life). Anyway, what should I do if we can’t get them to a trainer? Because all my mom says is we already have a trainer and just says that I am.

My mom was going to leave him because she was so scared, but then she found out she was going to have my third sister, so she stayed. A couple years go by and I get hearing aids and get bullied for 2 years everyday and ended up getting PTSD from it.

So we stayed. When she was about 1, my dad went on a trip for the military branch he was in. He was gone about 6 months. But you know what happened? He ended up cheating on my mom with a young girl on the boat who actually was supposed to be the sorta priest on board. It killed my moms soul, and mine.

So even though she now gets annoyed when I remind her 10 times a day, she is my best friend."
service_dogs,f3hbib7,t1_f3h9urs,1570921499.0,Ok thank you 👌
service_dogs,f3h5xzk,t1_f3g19p6,1570919390.0,Hmmm ok. The only thing I was worried about it was that it had a service dog vest on and the owner even said it was an SD. People called it a therapy dog though so idk
mentalillness,f3fsxhx,t1_f3ec723,1570902122.0,"My sister is an amazing person. Although she is younger than me (by only a couple months) and she might get a bit crazy sometimes, she understands me since she has epilepsy. Also, my mom said she would report a temporary paralysis."
mentalillness,f3fsjxd,t1_f3e1163,1570901949.0,"What should I do then? Both sides of my family seem to make my PTSD worse. I have 2 close friends, but they are both in completely different states. Plus, one side of my family (my dads) has my service dog that I need back."
mentalillness,f3fs7og,t1_f3dz90n,1570901798.0,"I actually lock the bathroom door, but you can easily unlock it with your fingernail. I litterally have zero place to go and think or freak out by myself. She is a person that believes that God is everything and that we should only watch and do things that please him. I’m bisexual and I haven’t told her because I would definitely get kicked out of my house. She litterally banned a PG rated show (that mind you she lets my little sisters watch PG-13 stuff for some reason) just because it had a 5 second scene of 2 guys kissing. I have tried to talk to her about it as well, and she seems to understand at that time but when I’m freaking out, she doesn’t care it seems to me. What else should I do if she doesn’t listen?"
service_dogs,f3frmxn,t1_f3drxvb,1570901547.0,"Thank you for this! The problem with the ESA is that they actually slapped a vest on that dog too...it was sniffing at things, not heeling, barked twice, and walked away from the owner. I seriously don’t know what to do since they are technically kinda breaking the law..."
mentalillness,f3frcfq,t1_f3dmi7f,1570901421.0,My mom has a lot of physical problems that was passed on through me. She actually made me tell her that I was lying and tell her that could talk and respond to her when I was panicking and when she was screaming at me...she said if I didn’t admit that that she would not let me go to school and I would go to a mental hospital
mentalillness,f3dcprd,t1_f3db8n0,1570834803.0,Unfortunately I can’t. My dad is even worse with anger issues. I want to run away so badly but if I do I may never get my service dog and my best friend back. I don’t even have any friends to run away to here since I just moved...
memes,f3b0kce,t1_f3b07gc,1570798216.0,Gotta ask my sister that one

I have PTSD now from the person who bullied me, so encouragement is always nice :) please, others if you can tell everyone you know and/or trust if you are being bullied. I didn’t get any help for 6 years, and am now currently trying to get help."

AskReddit,f379fro,t3_dfw5c5,1570723109.0,"My sisters story, but there was a teacher who was really creepy to my sister and her friends (who are all very pretty especially my sis and her BFF). He would go up to them and whisper in their ears and touch them on their shoulder,back,and other places. They got really fed up with him and ended up telling to office, who said they would keep an eye on him. He was also the bike team teacher, which is important to the story. At the end of the year, the teachers were like ok you know what we will transfer you to a different school. When my sister and her friends got their grades back, they all got D’s. They were good students too, and guess who got A’s. Yeah, the kids on the bike team which also actually had one kid in there that the teacher liked but didn’t care about school but the teacher litterally just gave him a pass. My sister and her friends were all pissed and the office didn’t believe them when they said that they did their work and that he gave them a bad grade. He knew that my sisters group told the office also. So yeah, pretty bad my dad got really mad as well."

I’m sorry I don’t have all the info, (sadly people downvoted it now so it probably won’t be seen to much now) but now I have all the answers that people have had."
