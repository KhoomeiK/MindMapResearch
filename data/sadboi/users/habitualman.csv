Her life is miserable.  There is no love in her life. Her husband hates her but won’t divorce because of his company. Her only solace is making herself appear superior to everyone. We all placated her for a while but eventually we got sick of catering to her ego. She has now disowned us all because we don’t bow to her whims.  

I would say communication is key but it’s more than likely you or your other family will be addressing a brick wall.  Her life is likely now predicated on being better than everyone. Without that feeling of superiority there isn’t much left."

GreenBayPackers,f8puobn,t1_f8pfsm3,1574707571.0,I disagree in part. We ran the ball for 6 yards on 1st and ten. 2:16 on the clock for 2nd down. You HAVE to run the ball there and take it down to two minutes.  It’s the only logical choice when your offense is going 3 and out all the time. That leaves u a third and short AFTER the 2 minute warning. That way the D gives up 1 score in a worst case scenario.

It’s the main reason the bears were good last year. Great defense and an ungodly amount of turnovers. Trubisky looked good playing on short fields. This season they are regressing towards the mean and we see what they are. Fortunately for us we have a much better QB.  

I feel we are a pretty balanced team. We are good on both sides but we’ve also had a real tough schedule.  Our game plans have varied a lot between some of the teams we played which is why I think we’ve seen some drastically different results."
