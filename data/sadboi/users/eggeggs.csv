amazonfresh,fo3kiof,t3_fufj0f,1587488429.0,Just got one in Orange County. They don't let you add stuff after ordering anymore which kinda screwed me cause they said they would allow 60 min after I ordered to add in more stuff. I rushed to get the order time and not worry about the few things in my cart because I knew (or so I thought!) I could add in more stuff. I was lucky enough to still have eggs and sausages in my cart so at least I can eat that until the next amazon fresh opening.

television,fln1c19,t1_flmyb3a,1585305390.0,"Ok did some reading and will have to agree that the cages are much larger than the documentary made it seem like. 
However, I definitely do think she is exploiting them because regardless of whether or not she sells her animals, she is also opening up her sanctuary to the public for money which is something she looked down on Joe for doing. Personally I don't know much about the topic of endangered species so when I first heard Carole's mission statement about trying to save big cats and having a sanctuary, I just assumed it was some type of open field (wasn't sure how this would be viable at all), but to see that it was just in a similar ""zoo"" setting made me know she was on the same level as Joe. She says that she just gives them a good home until they die which I feel like is counterintuitive to keeping the species alive; I'm not saying she should breed them, but there has to be a better answer than what she is doing. Honestly, the thing I appreciate about Joe is that at least he is not hiding the fact that he is selling them for money whereas Carole just seems to hide her ulterior motives in her ""peace, joy, love, cats"" bullshit facade. I know Joe doesn't own up to everything he does and he is also ignorant as fuck, but I can confidently say I like him more than Carole. I mean some of the shit he does to get back at Carole is just petty comedic GOLD."

SuicideWatch,fli401v,t3_fona6j,1585174881.0,"Yup I feel this. I have also been suicidal for a very long time. The hardest thing about it is that every single day could be the day I die, so I don't have the energy to put effort into anything at all. Also it sucks because being depressed is something I can talk about with a lot of people, but my issue isn't that I am just depressed, it is that I am suicidal.. but you can't talk about being suicidal anywhere but online because it causes people to view you differently, take pity, ask too many questions, be scared of you etc. The only reason why I am living a mediocre life is because most of the time, my depression is interchangeable with being suicidal."

dating_advice,fck5mjh,t3_ehm7sq,1577717268.0,"Move on. He doesnt seem to be very in touch with his emotions b/c he had a whole ass relationship with you (banter, sex, etc) but a call from his EX makes him realize he’s not over her?  His baggage shouldn’t be yours to carry. If he wants to get over her, he has to do it himself. Sharing the burden of his heartbreak will only give you the potential to have feelings of insecurity over his previous relationship which wont reflect well on your relationship together (or your future relationships). Dont put your life on pause over someone else. If you guys are meant to be, you will cross paths again. He let you go, so it’s time you do the same."

I highly suggest you define the relationship to make sure you guys are on the same page."

dating_advice,fbpwjwu,t3_ee1cok,1577025789.0,"Completely agree! I find that sex with someone you're not in a relationship with is not satisfying. 99% of the time, men aren't the best one night stand partners and the only way you will get guaranteed AMAZING sex is if you are in a relationship with that person and have had time to practice with them. I love being single and prefer it over being in a relationship, however there are times where I will get really bored and venture out into casual dating, which sometimes leads to hooking up. 

Every time I ""casually date"" or hook up with someone, it just confirms the fact that I do not want ""casual"". I feel like keeping things casual means that it's mainly just about sex. I like to have a connection with the person that I am having sex with and don't wanna waste my time building a connection if it is just going to be ""casual"". 

The person who is right for you will also have similar views."

dating_advice,fbay57l,t1_fbavm7r,1576689296.0,"Yes!! Go do it! It'll take a huge weight off your shoulders. I don't know when you guys were dating, but if it was during your teenage years (first love and whatnot), I've realized that people's emotions will never be as intense as they were when they were going through puberty. That is mainly why it was so hard to let my ex go, because the entire relationship was so INTENSE and I FELT THAT SHIT SO HARD!!! 

Also, if things happen to go good, just don't forget all the red flags. If trust is broken, it can almost never be restored. You might reminisce on the good ol days, but I hope that that will make you realize that there were bad days too. The good days can be a memory that you cherish forever, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you will have good days with him if you move forward with the relationship. It's also easy to compare the fire you guys had for each other back then to present day, and that fire may never be as bright as it once was. This can just tarnish all those precious memories you had.. They say if you love something you gotta let it go."
dating_advice,fbawq2s,t1_fbaux8y,1576688410.0,"That is FUCKED!

Honestly, the fact that he was hiding you just shows that he wasn't truly worthy of your love. He didn't see your worth which is not a you problem, it's a HIM PROBLEM. He's a fucking dick and this probably has brought up a lot of trust issues and insecurities.. This is super cliche, but time really does heal all wounds and even though it sucks right now, one day you'll realize that he did not fucking deserve you at all. The other ""girlfriend"" is a fool for even staying with him after you sent her proof. These are two FUCKIN CLOWNS OUT HERE CLOWNING AROUND AT THE DAMN CIRCUS!! I'm not sure if you miss him or not, but good fucking riddance. He is scum! The person you are meant to be with would never treat you like this and would show you off to the world!

At the end of the day, you feel undervalued and ""ugly"" because you are seeing yourself through what you perceive to be his perspective. But like I already said, this man is fucking scum and who the fuck cares what a scumbag thinks? NOT YOU! Hes a damn cheater and his other ""girlfriend"" probably feels just as shitty as you! She probably thinks that he was dating you because she was not enough for him. Basically he is a manipulative whore of a man and I thank god that you got the fuck out of that. Focus on yourself, love yourself, and find who you were as a person before him. One day you might see this as a blessing because of how much stronger you came out of it!

Dont let this man control your emotions! He AINT SHIT!!"
dating_advice,fbava4x,t3_ecegzz,1576687532.0,"People change a lot over the course of 8 years. I thought that me and my ex would maybe get back together again because he was my first love and I had been through so much with him. We decided to meet up just to catch up and we had changed so much from who we were, that we just didn't click the same way anymore. I knew that he still had some feelings for me, but I had changed so much over the past years that I felt nothing for him. Meeting him was really validating for me and helped me get rid of my baggage. This might be the same for you! I hate the feeling of ""what couldve been"" and if I hadn't met up with my ex, I would still be wondering."
dating_advice,fbauu8y,t3_ecelye,1576687266.0,"Ask her again next week! Waiting until the new year might make her lose interest or she might find another man. If she is trying to avoid the plans, then she probably isn't interested. By asking earlier, at least you won't be wasting time waiting around for her.

Also, there was this one time, that a guy gave me his number on instagram and I texted him and I got no response. A couple months later, he reached out again on instagram and asked me why I hadn't texted him. Turns out he typed one number wrong! Since you said that the conversation was flowing nicely, I don't think she was purposely not texting you, especially when she has a reason to text you (the photo). Maybe she just forgot or maybe you gave her the wrong number on accident.

Next time you see her, if you don't know how to start the conversation, just bring the photo up and have her send it to you right then and there or ask for her number and then text her to send it to you!"
