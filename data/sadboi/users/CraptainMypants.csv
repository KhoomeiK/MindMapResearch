Avoid untreated water, and let treated water stand for at least an hour before you drink it.

If you're wanting to build a bag, go out with the basics for a weekend and see what you do and don't use. Throw out what wasn't needed, and repeat. Once you're at the bare bones, build up from there. Overall weight affects speed and maneuverability, which is key."
Survival,ezkgn43,t3_d16mws,1567959983.0,"That's a good start for a trunk bag. Things I've learned - small and light are expensive. With some goofy techniques, you can always make something at least a little smaller for free. If you decide down the road to upgrade to lighter, you're already ahead of the curve.

Get a GOOD multitool and ditch the knives. I've done some pretty wild shit with my Leathermans, and they've lived with me in the woods for weeks at a time. Other than possibly wanting a small hatchet out of convenience, I've never needed anything else.

As others have said, that can opener haha. If you get a multi tool, those have one.

From what I saw, you're only packing 7-800 calories, and that main meal requires water. Either snag an MRE or carry some sort of canned food that lasts. Something with low sodium that doesn't require water.

Ammo doesn't need to be waterproofed. Put that 9mm into a mag, the box takes up waaaaay too much space. If you don't have spare mags, save up, they come in handy. The 22 ammo, unless you carry a rifle in your car, I would dump. If your main mission is to just make it back to X or last X hours, I guarantee you won't be hunting small animals. Think of it like speed running a video game - you aren't there to shoot things or get points, you're trying to get from A to B as quickly as possible. 

I've seen some questionable quality on those water bags. If you see a Nalgene at a thrift store, buy it. It won't break. If it somehow does, it gets replaced for free.

For the love of all that is holy, organize that rope. I learned my lesson when I had to untangle 5-600 feet of paracord. Speaking of which, use paracord. You can buy it used from milsurp stores, and it's still in decent shape. For what you'll be needing, it'll cover the bill for cheap.

I know it's not crazy hot up there, and you have abundant fresh water sources, but carry more of it. Please. We would pack a minimum of a gallon of water with us at all times. Sometimes where you'd expect there to be a refill point, it's either locked or dead, which can put a huge limit on your endurance if dehydration kicks in.

As others have mentioned, that flashlight. Lol. I won't knock anyone for a starter bag, my first one was WAY worse than this. I've learned to spend the money on good lights though. Use ebay if you have to. Carry at least 2 sets of batteries. I run a Fenix 25pd and have been very happy with it. 

For gloves, get something comfortable that breathes. If you can wear those for 24hr with no issues, run them. I've worn my mechanix gloves for nearly a week straight, taking them off to sleep and eat, and had no major issues - they weren't crazy durable though. 

It looks as if you're on the right track though. This is a little ""much"" for a 24hr kit, but way short for a 72hr kit. I'll comment with the things Ive put in our assault packs for short times in the woods. It's pretty minimalist, but I didn't really find myself needing anything more."

AskReddit,ez9gz3z,t1_ez9axqe,1567782046.0,"It sounds absolutely cliche, but we just made things happen for them. Ever seen the movie casino/goodfellas? Like that.

They want a table at the nicest restaurant at the casino, and there's no room? Well some unsuspecting patron just got their meal for free, and promptly booted out so they could make room. Tickets to any show, done in advance, especially on birthdays and anniversaries. They want to have their wife on the 20th floor, and their girlfriend on the 5th floor without each other finding out? We'll make it happen (one guy was always doing this). Want a limo to literally anywhere in a 2-3 hour radius, and you want to leave in 15 minutes? Done. 

Most people weren't this bad - many just wanted a nice room and a private table to gamble at.

Nearly every ""rule"" was relaxed or completely disregarded if you spent enough money. A fairly famous Houston rapper would gamble, and I swear every chance he got, would light up a joint at the tables. Regular people would get arrested. He would just get nicely asked to go back to his room and smoke there.

Another guy had a floor level suite that connected to the pool. Got mega drunk and decides to rip off all his clothes, yell at people from his little fenced in ""area"", then jump in the pool totally naked. Got in a fight with security when they tried to cover him up. Nothing happened.

When people's paychecks literally depend on guests spending as much money as possible in the shortest amount of time, people will turn a blind eye to nearly anything to keep them from leaving."
AskReddit,ez8u0th,t1_ez8t4gb,1567759516.0,"Oh man, I honestly forgot about half of them, but let me dig

Got to meet Gladys Knight. Nice sweet old lady, didn't have much to say. I think I got a copy of her set list off the stage for my mom.

Larry the Cable guy was cool, didn't tip super well but was nice to hang out with. Zero accent when off stage.

Met this comedian named Terry Fador (sp?). He's like a knock off of that popular puppet comedian who also sucked. Guy had just divorced his wife that had been with him forever, only to marry his WAY younger assistant. He was literally falling over himself trying to give her attention. It reminded me of how guys try to win over a girl in highschool thats way out of their league haha. Plus his mom was with them. Suuuper weird.

Pauly D was cool. He was banging a mutual friend at the time and chuckled when I brought up her name. Offered to take him out to party afterwards, he turned it down. Bummer.

Jerry Lee Lewis was a huuuuuuuge dick, which was disappointing. So many lifelong fans wanted to see him after the show and he promised he would stick around. Nope, he immediately dipped and refused to walk through the lobby of the casino where fans were waiting, so we had to cart him around in our maze of hallways to his room.

Jay Leno was the bomb. By far my favorite I ever met. Literally can't speak high enough of the man. Tipped really well and gave great life advice. 

Another was an older rock band, black something. Something black. I don't remember. They smelled like lo mein and cheap beer, but were cool and gave me some booze haha

Ed ""Too Tall"" Jones. Apparently he was a big name basketball player. Whatever. Dude pulls out a literal WAD of 20/100 bills, easily $10k, and asks if I have change for a $20 so he can tip me. Nah dude, I see youre hurting, keep it.

Got to hang out with a bunch of players from the NE patriots, and took them to a strip club. I'm not a sports guy, so it was just another day. Dudes partied super hard, I got to see boobs, and got paid overtime since they stayed out 5 hours past my shift. We shoved one of them in the trunk of the escalade since he was legit blackout. Solid guys haha.

I got puked on and slapped by some chick named DJ Adriana that we would fly in from LA. She was super hot (and talented), which helped her case in coming back, but we eventually cut the contract because she managed to no-show for a ton of events. She tried getting me to come up to her room after the puke/slap incident, but I was dating an insanely hot/amazing girl at the time, and didn't need any more crazy in my life. Ended up dating a girl that looked and acted EXACTLY like her a few years later. Just as hot, just as crazy, and found out a few weeks into dating that she had active warrants. The hot/crazy scale was in full effect there. 

I know there are some more, but those are the only ones off the top of my head."
AskReddit,ez8qrba,t1_ez8pwas,1567754380.0,"Oh man. You're reminding me of all the self proclaimed ""whales"" that would pull up in a 5 year old maserati and demand it get parked up front. Sorry brochacho, we save those spots for the Ferraris and Lamborghinis. I see you though, keep on walking to the buffet so you can inevitably call your host because it isn't free. 

The ones that bucked the trend were our Asian clients. Had a dude who owned a seafood import company. He would come every month and budgeted EXACTLY $300K to gamble with. Not a cent more. What did he drive? An absolute beat to fuck Nissan Sentra. So many were like this. They wouldn't even bother bringing clothes or checking into their room - they'd just crash in the lobby, grab a coffee, and continue gambling. It became sort of a game to see how many were sleeping in the lobby, I think our record was 11 or 12. These dudes didn't fuck around, hence why we ALWAYS had pai gow tables ready to play. 

But I do agree. Quiet/old money was much nicer to deal with. They usually dressed like your grandpa but had no issues buying a $5k Breitling watch that you know they will never wear, purely because it looked neat or had a cool feature. Newer money was all about image and designer EVERYTHING (not that there's anything wrong with it). We treated them all very well, but everyone on staff knew who had the bark and  who had the bite."
AskReddit,ez8enms,t3_d072nh,1567741208.0,"Late in the game here. My job had me dealing directly with the (extremely) high level players behind the scenes - I wasn't a dealer.

One guy and his friends came in and lived like Rockstars for a few days, they couldnt have been older than 30. Made all of their money in the early stages of spice/synthetic thc. Once they lost all of their money, they couldn't afford the helicopter to take them to the airport, which was a 15 minute drive with traffic. Absolutely lost their minds that they had to go back in an escalade. I've never seen someone so entitled.

Another young player hit it big. Once. I think he made 6-700k in a lucky night? For some reason, I gave him my phone number. On a random off day, he calls me asking if I can wire him $200 so he can ""double it"". Guy was broke by my next shift. Ended up visiting him waaaaay later and the dude lived in probably the worst part of Houston I've ever seen, did absolutely nothing productive with the money.

We had one extremely wealthy player who was always hit or miss, and would only come in every year or two. His previous trip he made around $2m, and literally destroyed a limo on his way to the airport - it spent 6 months getting the interior replaced. Came again and lost a hair over $4m, and was cool as a cucumber. I'll never understand it.

The worst were people I considered friends. Everyone gets down on there luck, so I would try and pull strings to make their stay at least not so bad. Free tickets to sold out shows, calling in favors to club owners to get them some decent access, etc. The thing is, they wouldn't take the hint to slow down, or just stop gambling away the money they didnt have. They've all lost the spark to who they once were. Every. Single. One. I still occasionally see them online flaunting their ""VIP"" access that they blatantly used someone elses account to get, and it's just depressing. It seems so surreal to see someone living an absolutely fabricated life when you know it's 100% fake.

Upside, met tons of celebrities - some cool, some not. Got paid super well for my age, and had zero oversight, which made for some great stories.

EDIT: I saw someone mention further down, but comps. HOLY SHIT THE COMPS. People would spent THOUSANDS of dollars solely to get an ""upgraded"" players card. I shit you not. I think we had 5 levels, with the first level being Red. The next tier was useless, and would require $10k in play. The third level was when you actually got any ""benefits"", like a shopping and food discount of 10%, and required $75k in play. The fourth level was what everyone aimed for, as it gave you access to the VIP lounge and free snacks/booze. How much did this cost? $250,000. Yes. A quarter of a million dollars. The highest level was a black card, required around $875,000 in play, and only the legitimately wealthy had these - and they rightfully got free reign of the casino. The people in levels 1-3 were just your regular problematic gamblers with a true hatred for retirement, literally emptying their accounts for a shiny piece of plastic and mid-tier seats at a 3 Doors Down concert.

The kicker, the card would reset every year. If you didn't gamble enough to meet the criteria every 12 months, you lost your card. It's one of the few things that absolutely separated the ""real"" rich from the ""fake"" rich. The real rich rarely had players cards or gave a shit about discounts or points - they knew what they were worth, and the casino would provide accordingly or they would bring their (literal) millions to another casino with zero hesitation. It was a very enlightening few years for me."

Honestly, rucking is tough for lots of people. Setting up your pack is key. I always pack mine bottom heavy, with the water up top.
