bipolar2,fkgqu3p,t3_fidm10,1584169979.0,Thank you !! I think I’m going to start doing that just to keep everything in perspective and just to remind myself that at some point I was thinking stable enough to recognize what’s going on.
bipolar2,fkgqqzw,t3_fidm10,1584169864.0,Thank you! Just reading and knowing that I am not alone helps so much. It still just astounds me how my mind works. Every bit of advice helps. Thank you 💕
Parenting,fkgm6kv,t3_fib8kv,1584164453.0,"DO NOT LET HER LISTEN TO THAT SAME EXACT PLAYLIST EVER AGAIN. Music is a wonderful thing and it sounds and speaks differently to each and every one of us. Some music makes us feel joy and happiness while other music makes us feel sad or lonely or suicidal even. You cannot take away the single songs themselves because your daughter may relate to each seperate song in a different way. ALTHOUGH a playlist that is titled suicide music has one only goal, to encourage suicide. Do not take the specific songs and tell her she can never listen to them again but take each one and SPECIFICALLY listen to each and every one by themselves and try to understand what THAT SPECIFIC song is saying to her. All the songs put together obviously make her feel a certain type of way otherwise she would have not labeled the playlist suicide music. But each individual song may be speaking to her in a certain way that does not necessarily mean suicide but may mean some of the negative emotions associated with suicide. Music is such a powerful thing. I promise you, If you go through each and every song with your daughter and ask her what she is getting out of said song, you will begin to understand the reasoning for  “suicide music” label and you will get so much closer to understanding why she labeled it so and hopefully you will be able to take that knowledge and use it to encourage her and understand her and let her know that as scary as her feelings are they are validated and you are there to make those feelings go away.
From one mother to another 💕"

bipolar2,fhgdgxy,t3_f32458,1581564347.0,I’ve started an accelerated program (because they say I’m smart) for being a medical assistant and then furthering to first responder
bipolar2,fhgcpj4,t1_fhgc6rh,1581563821.0,"Thank you so much. I’m just scared because every time I speak completely openly and honestly about this kind of state I’m feeling with my partner..I always end up hospitalized..and that can’t happen because school finally starts in a week and I can’t fuck it up, this is finally my time.."
bipolar2,fhgcht8,t1_fhgcasx,1581563676.0,Thank you! I guess I just feel like I’m panicking which obviously makes me more stressed. It’s like a restless feeling because I’m trying so hard to fight the thoughtless actions I want to take. It’s just making me so unbearably anxious
bipolar2,fhgbmse,t1_fhgbh2n,1581563086.0,I don’t know whether to just tell my partner that I’m thinking about doing terrible things to myself or whether to suck it up and NOT stop my medication and let the hypomania rice itself out and hope I don’t destroy myself like I did the last time
bipolar2,fhgbj03,t1_fhgbh2n,1581563013.0,Thank you so much for responding. I just feel so confused and scared right now I don’t know what to do
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fha4z45,t3_f21jum,1581397344.0,Cocaine is a hell of a drug. Puts you on top of the world and leaves you wanting death. Go to that meeting. Then go to a meeting the next day and the next day and the next day after that until you’re not forcing yourself to go anymore. You’re going because it’s helpful or you’ve found a sponsor or whatever positive reason. Cocaine will always be socially acceptable but don’t make it personally acceptable to you. One way or another if that’s what you continue to chose you’ll only find destruction. All love and prayers to you 💕
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fguu81f,t3_f0hm65,1581129543.0,"No one can completely and fully understand the exact hurt and pain you’re going through. But so many of us can use our similar situations to offer guidance and encouragement. I’m here, message me if you need. You are strong, you will overcome. This may seem like such a downfall but you have done the right thing by asking for help. We are here 💕"

MacMiller,fdt23p7,t3_emzagx,1578710922.0,💕 no words will ever be good enough to describe how much he deserves this. ❤️
bipolar,fd7vdqw,t3_ek9sj0,1578210709.0,I completely understand ! A lot of the things you’re describing are symptoms I had when I was hypomanic. You should definitely be talking to your doctor about all the things going on and that you’re feeling. If you feel like you’re suicidal or if you’ve had piling thoughts about planning it definitely go to the ER. Usually they are able to help you identify whether you need more hospitalization or a fix with your meds. Stay safe ❤️
