Well, the first few seasons were great but when Matt Smith came in S5, WOW that shows just became a whole new thing. I'm currently rewatching the whole show starting from S5 with matt smith.

Season 11 isn't that good. IMO I mean, its not that its cause the doctor is now a female, I really love her personality and excitement, which is a nice lift from the last doctor grumpy feel. She gives me David Tennant Vibes, which is a huge plus

But the story IMHO was really bland and wasn't that interesting for me to go past episode 2. I really wish  Steven Moffat was still the writer for the show, She would have probably been my favourite if she had a great story"

And the other disadvantages you've mentioned aren't really anything anymore. Apple music and Netflix isn't a pricy option (kudos for apple for offering it for lower prices in asia).I can see how the double sim would be a disadvantage for some tho, but with things like unlimited cloud storage with Google photos at a decent quality, not really a big issue,64gb too is a quite decent.And if im not mistaken , every iPhone after 8 does have fast charge, not out of the box tho , but since it supports  USB PD,you can just use your old adapter off an android phone that had fast charge to use on your iPhone but again those specs are quite good for the price xiaomi offers , but me being the more simpler things in life type of person,I don't really find any of the extra quirks android has to draw me in , been using an s8 for the last 3 years,I live the phone and it's running strong, but Samsung stopped with android 9 has my last ever updateand I'm not keen on rooting.

Anyways, coming from experience with being an extreme introvert to being more of an extrovert.

The best advice I can give you is, don't go for online dating, even if it is for an FWB relationship.

Try opening up and being more social. Gradually being more social is key! Rome wasn't built in a day after all.

If you do overcome social anxiety and being more outgoing, going outside your comfort zone, one public humiliation at a time(how I personally overcame my fears and by watching **AlphaM** on youtube😂😂😂)

Dating and FWB's would be a snitch.

And if you were not intending to be more outgoing and found my comment pointless, then my advice still holds, Don't looks online for dates or hookups(at least not in Reddit! )"

srilanka,fiwy24u,t3_fa780c,1582807318.0,"We've been on solar for about 3 years or so, and the costs and benefits are clear(that is if you buy the right amount of panels for your usage). The minimum fixed costs we've been paying are about 30rs. but that rarely is the case for us. The solar panel company gave us a quote for what my dad told was for 4 Acs for 8hrs a day and other regular appliances as lighting, water heaters, fans washing machine etc. This coughed us around 1.5M all in all with the installation and everything.

Unfortunately, that was only an ideal situation and in reality, we use the AC's for much longer than just 8 hours leaving our bill sometimes above 10k(we switched to newer more efficient Aircons a couple of months ago, as one was drawing way too much power and, now gave us a bill for a little under 2k). So just a helpful tip, don't give them an ideal situation for them to suggest how many panels you need, and just cough up the extra if you know you're not going to live but to those standards cause it's going to pay in the long run. Maybe monitor and make a write down all your electricity usage for a week(or better a month) and hand it over to them?

If cash isn't a huge problem for you, look into buying some residential batteries for when the power goes, Talk to your solar panel provider, We didn't go for this option but after all the blackouts I kinda wish we did go for a tiny battery

But for the times that we are charged just the base 30rs, the excess supply we give the electricity board(that is when we produce more than we use). It is credited on our account

It should be noted that this can't is cashed and the money will only be used when you have an excess demand(when you produce less than you use)and the excess electricity costs will be deducted from your past excess supply from the past.

Funny story, my dad got a bill of 50k Cr and not realising it was credited to his account he paid 50k, so just be careful when you read your bills and always have a look once in a while at your solar production(our panels came with an app to give in detail usage and production)

we use sunny solar panels btw, great company and great customer support"
