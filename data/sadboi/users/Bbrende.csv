Not sure if it‚Äôs only the CBD oil that‚Äôs been helping me, because I‚Äôve also been eating healthier, getting enough sleep, and working out 5-6 days a week. 

I have not tried going without cbd oil. 

I was taking CBD gummies in California (bought at a gas station), and now since I‚Äôve been home I‚Äôve been using oil from a dispensary. I was doing gummies for maybe three weeks, and oil for about five weeks. I haven‚Äôt been cycling on and off.
