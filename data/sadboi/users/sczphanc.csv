media_criticism,fhiw5sq,t1_fhitmlu,1581633037.0,"you seem like a sincere guy that feels alienated from the political landscape and a bit disoriented when confronted with the realities of you progression in life. probably between 14-19 or 21-26. but who knows anymore, those can be constant feelings now, ones that strike randomly in this kafkaesque world. a guy smart enough to see that there are very real social forces acting on you, ones you cannot control and are discontent with, but haven't fully explored avenues of thought that challenge your own intuition (don't blame you, we've all been there). I sympathize with you, truly. I hope one day you join us over here on the left. I hope you find a way to cope with your alienation and discontent in a productive way regardless."
media_criticism,fhhbbrq,t1_fhhan9k,1581599879.0,"you're probably going to get a lot of shit but I don't blame you actually. don't get me wrong, I do not agree with you and I actually think this is a bad take, but I can understand why you would feel like liberal personalites are much more well liked than conservative ones like Ben Shapiro in most major news outlets. my response would be that yes, they are liberals, but they are just the flip side of the Fox and Friends, Brietbart and National Review. those publications like to sell themselves as being part of the minority, part of the real people of the United States but they aren't. they are the same as the NYT and CNN. I would say that the former publications are a bit more honest but the sentiment is there. but a lot of us don't like the media either. I'm a leftist, further than Bernie. I am syndicalist. Back in the day when we were a massively influential political force the media did literally everything they could to demonize and destroy us and we are seeing the same thing by major news outlets now to both the far right and far left. now once again, I think that demonizing the far right can be a good thing when you are talking about people like, say, Richard Spencer but I do understand where you're coming from."

hope it helps. it's hard at first. a lot of the things we feel and the ways we feel them are difficult to explain and confront but it is still anxiety, it is still a type of trauma, even if it isn't like other anxieties and traumas. even if it feels like you can't get the words out, keep trying and be crude if you have to. even just trying to say it to someone can help. hope you benefit from it!"
schizophrenia,fhf1ivt,t3_f2hf3o,1581534296.0,"anxiety and trauma are parts of psychosis. on both ends. a lot of hallucinations and delusions are abstractions of anxiety and trauma. psychosis can make you anxious and traumatized in itself. idk about you but when I come out of an episode I definitely have anxieties about things like the possibility of slipping back into it, that I ruined relationships, that I didn't maintain responsibilities, that I'm no longer capable of being normal, etc. I also am sometimes traumatized by the things I had seen and heard and thought as if they were real (because they were to me). try talking to her about the things that aren't directly psychotic; it can help"
