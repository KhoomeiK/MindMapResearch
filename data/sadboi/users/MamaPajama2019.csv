If possible find one that specializes in migraines.  I would also research concussions.  Sounds like the concussion and migraines are related but I'm not a doctor.  

I went to a college of osteopathy because of my migraines.  It was like a really in-depth chiropractor visit.  I was told that because of a blow to my head the plates in my skull were not in proper alignment.  This was causing my spinal fluid to not flow properly and it was causing my headaches.  I only went once because my schedule didn't fit with their hours so I don't know if it would have helped.  Something else to look into though.

Good luck!"
