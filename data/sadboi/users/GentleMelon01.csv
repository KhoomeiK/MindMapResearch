gamedev,fqtk0td,t1_fqthmn8,1589640516.0,"I'm no market researcher but i have a lot of experience in the world of gaming and i can tell you that if you wanna sell a game you **have** to put it up on steam. I honestly don't know how you would do so, but i heard from a friend that it isn't all that hard or costly, and considering the amount of people who use steam (both indie devs and the big names in the industry) its probably a game developer's best bet. Also i suggest you try to put your game up on as many different websites as possible, again, i am no expert, but its probably the best way to have as many people as possible play your game."
