2meirl4meirl,fbc1byx,t1_fbarrza,1576713252.0,"1 and 3 are tricky. I had always bottled everything up in basically all of my 20s because I was kind of a pushover. I thought that if I ""absorbed"" all the negativity of the people that were around me that it would help keep all my relationships with my ex and my friends and even my boss at the time as stable as possible. Little did I know I was hurting myself in doing so because I was letting a few very manipulative and narcissistic people do this to me. Then one day I opened up to my best friend in a Snapchat message. I knew that nobody except her would ever see it since it deleted afterwards. Her advice was to GET THE FUCK OUT of all of these bad situations because these people were all taking advantage of me and I was suffering immensely because of it. I then talked to my mom, then my dad, and then my close group of good friends (basically my discord/gaming friends group that's been around for the last 16 years that I met through wow but am friends with irl now) about all of this and they became what I always actually needed: a solid support system. I went from that point to getting my divorce, getting my own place, and ghosting every single friend from that old group of friends that was just about mentally rotting me from the inside. 

So I'd say that #1 and #3 shouldn't be something you do on your own. Do something better than I did: find a therapist that will help you reach those two goals. I wish I had done that instead of doing everything backwards and putting my closest friends and family through the VERY BLUNT end of all of my mental issues I had to sort through. I love them all so much but if I could go back I'd go to a therapist first and foremost and then open up to your actual loved ones as your therapist advises.  

I hope all this helps you. And I'm here to talk to you if you ever need to hear from someone who had to learn all this the very hard way. üôÉ

If I could tell my 20s self advice that would've changed/prevented years of awful mental health on many different levels it would be: totally get rid of toxic/manipulative people in your life; you don't actually have to do stuff you don't want to (socially) because you're an adult now; and take care of yourself before you take care of others - you're the one that needs it the most from yourself."
