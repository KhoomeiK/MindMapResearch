mentalillness,fnbmww1,t3_g0lkdg,1586818393.0,Cheering in the living room as I read this. You are an incredible human and ABSOLUTELY deserve to be happy. It takes so much strength to recognize that breaking down doesn't mean you aren't valuable and worthy of joy. SO FREAKING PROUD OF YOU
mentalhealth,flb7n8l,t3_fnk22w,1584999038.0,Your feelings are valid.
mentalillness,fkc4qwd,t3_fhjyqy,1584045760.0,"Mental health should not be hidden or taken more lightly than any physical illness. To this point, some jobs may not hire you. Just as they may not hire someone with Lyme Disease, or Crohn's disease, etc. However, your job is to make sure that you do not neglect yourself and the boundaries and/or accommodations that you may need, not to accommodate potential employer's ideals. You matter, so do what you need to do to continue living the life you want to live. There are plenty of employers who are more than happy to take on a capable individual who struggles with depression, anxiety, PTSD or other mental illnesses. Do what is right for you."
mentalillness,fjors7r,t3_fehdx2,1583533566.0,"It sounds like how some people have described depression. Depression can have a numbing effect and strong feelings like anger or anguish can be almost addictive because then you can feel something, which is also why many people turn to substance abuse- because it can make you feel something. While therapy is probably needed, it sounds like you don't want to take joy in violence, so maybe try it in conjunction with something else? Since you are struggling with substance abuse, maybe try something alternative/holistic? Acupuncture has some pretty promising studies, or TMS has been proven successful for a large percentage of people with treatment resistant depression (which yours sounds like it likely is?). Hopefully that helps."
therapy,fjoqy77,t3_fea426,1583533108.0,"Definitely tell someone. You don't deserve to be threatened like that, and even more if you think he will harm you that isn't okay at all. You deserve to feel safe."
mentalillness,fjonmsc,t1_fjn7zmc,1583531374.0,"If you have good insurance, TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) helps a lot of people in similar situations to what you're describing to find more motivation and a better lease on life if you'd like to get better. At least in the US most insurance covers it for depression, I don't know about the UK... but if not a lot of places have flexible payment plans too.

Also maybe volunteer at an animal rescue? When I was at a really low point and it was draining for me to be around a lot of people, I did that."
mentalillness,fjlo69d,t3_fe3taq,1583450663.0,"A lot of people feel this way when they are depressed, and that's why self-harm is so common- because at least then they can tell where the pain is coming from. 

There are lots of ways to feel better though, you just have to find the one that works for you. The hardest step is being willing to talk about it, so great job. Helpguide has an awesome article on different treatments that are available [here](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/depression/depression-treatment.htm)."
mentalillness,fjln8jd,t3_fdy4hy,1583450060.0,"It sounds like you're going through a lot of pain. I've been there too. In October of 2014 I nearly committed suicide, but someone stopped me. I'm so glad they did, and that's why I work at Serenity now. To help other people take back their life from depression and find happiness again. I promise, there is so much help out there, and it really can get better, but you have to be there to see it.

My mom uses acupuncture and its helped her a lot, and I've seen ketamine therapy really help some of the clients here."
mentalhealth,fjlm1ul,t3_fe3a24,1583449318.0,"Hospital visits are expensive and financial stress can feel overwhelming. You're not alone though and things can get better. Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you're feeling suicidal, ketamine therapy has helped a lot of our clients bridge the gap until they are able to get more long term help. There are lots of other options too. :)"
mentalhealth,fjlkzv6,t3_fe059g,1583448679.0,Great job <3
