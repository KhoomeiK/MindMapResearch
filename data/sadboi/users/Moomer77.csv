After this round I was like well I know what they are now. There were two small ones and I worked at a vet clinic so I took home a small scalpel blade and some numbing spray and cut them off using a mirror. They never returned but I think I was lucky. I would NOT recommend this as you don‚Äôt know if you get the whole wart and sharp objects near genitals is super risky. Go to planned parenthood or your doctor and have them frozen or cut off, much safer. Just wanted to share my story! I‚Äôve done a lot of stupid shit trust me. Good luck!"

In the beginning carbonated beverages taste funky so that‚Äôs kind of odd but that goes away. I read just awful side effects people got but the only things I‚Äôve experienced were the weird tasting carbonation which has subsided and sporadic tingling of my hands and feet which has also pretty much gone away.

migraine,fec4j4v,t3_eo4x80,1578966540.0,"I feel really really strange before my aura starts, almost like a panic attack. Luckily I get those as well (yay me)! Does anyone else get that? 

Last time I got one I was at a hibachi restaurant for my husbands birthday, perfect timing of course! Right when we sat down I just felt really strange! I can‚Äôt describe it but it feels like I‚Äôm not in my body and nothing is real! I‚Äôm like fuck am I having a panic attack or getting a migraine? So I immediately pop my migraine pills and take some deep breaths and fake smile to the waiter. About 5 minutes go by and I look over at the lady at my table and I can‚Äôt see her face, I just see aura...I‚Äôm like oh perfect! However because I had taken the medication right when I had that weird feeling I didn‚Äôt actually get any pain. Now this has never happened to me before in my lifetime history of horrific migraines and I‚Äôm sure won‚Äôt happen again but was wondering if anyone experiences a similar out of body/weird/panic attack feeling prior to aura/migraine? 

Sorry didn‚Äôt mean to take over your story I just know the frightening feeling of getting aura and it reminded me of my last one."

WomensHealth,fdzo8sw,t3_engnf3,1578792379.0,In my experience not wearing makeup (mascara mostly) is key.
