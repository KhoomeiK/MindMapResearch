Dreams,fr1p3az,t1_fr1ogu9,1589823550.0,"I’ve been cleaning out the garbage in this stream behind my house. Billions of glass shards. Bottles, car parts, old clothes. Almost every day since this quarantine started. Some things in there dating back to 1910. Do you think that I have upset something? I’m only trying to do good but maybe I’ve disrupted the peace somewhere along the way. I love nature and I love animals. I’m not sure why my dream was like that. 

But should I stop cleaning the stream?"

BipolarReddit,f4z6sqb,t1_f4z5ybx,1571897235.0,I never drive alone with the fear I’ll do the same. That would be an awesome thought to get rid of and I’m so thankful to not be alone with these thoughts. Not that I’d wish them upon anyone. Thank you for responding
BipolarReddit,f4z6om8,t1_f4z3yrc,1571897087.0,"I’ve already been losing sleep over having to take it. I do plan to call my dr tomorrow to see what they have to say. Whether they can put my mind at ease about it or try something else, if there is anything else. If I take it I will probably be just like you haha"
BipolarReddit,f4z6gkc,t1_f4z64fu,1571896807.0,"Thank you very much! .001% is such a low chance yet a piece of me believes my luck is that bad. You’re right about the dr, they seemed to truly care about getting me on the right track. Just going to have to push through the worries."
BipolarReddit,f4z6bnk,t1_f4z2xax,1571896635.0,Thank you for responding! It puts my mind at ease a little bit. I’m not sure I’m completely ready but there’s less anxiety there about it.
