Bible,fl8v6b9,t1_fl66iu3,1584933123.0,Thanks for providing a different perfective than I was seeing. I really like the idea of seeing these feelings more of an outsider rather than a friend.
Bible,fl8uyp3,t1_fl64pa1,1584932967.0,Thank you. This reply truly blessed me. It was comforting to hear those words and reminders. Also thank you for taking your time to reply as it meant a lot.

Hopefully we all make it through 2020 so we can get going on some pretty dope movies or some pretty mediocre ones.
selfharm,f9iifxw,t1_f9idok4,1575337923.0,Thanks that is really some helpful info. I appreciated it!
StopSelfHarm,f7vcgke,t3_dxjqrp,1574022540.0,I experience those “fantasies” they are extremely persistent. I would find ways to deal with those specific urges. In my experience the fantasy type self harm is where it got most dangerous. I had to find the core for that before I could even think about those feelings with winter on top. For me my core was hating myself so knowing that I could plan accordingly on how to go up against them and be prepared for those urges when I know I’ll be sensitive to those images. Good luck friend
selfharm,f5rpa21,t3_dozvl9,1572399717.0,Try paper towel first not toilet paper. Put pressure on it for about ten minutes. Once it stops bleeding make sure it won’t start again. If it does start again get some bandages.
badtattoos,ey1prt8,t3_cuu3ea,1566706852.0,This would be good if it was 40+ years old and not touched up at all
SelfHarmScars,ey0xv2p,t3_cqzifd,1566685414.0,If I don’t have time I jut say I’d rather not talk about it right now. If they are asking nicely I just say they are old self harm scars and it’s something I’ve had to work on. If it’s someone asking kinda nosey I just say they are scars if they ask why I say it’s none of their business
SelfHarmScars,ey0xlxb,t3_cr1yih,1566685283.0,This is probably too old now but I find changing the position of the bandaid helps and also trying not to change it more than once a day unless needed also I find just using a larger bandage/or a different brand can help
SelfHarmScars,ey0x0p9,t1_exjhor4,1566685065.0,Tis true my friend if you don’t have the money for actual gauze at least use paper towel and Vaseline as it won’t breakdown into your wound
sticknpokes,exs5epz,t3_cu8cwk,1566532866.0,"It’s not too bad right now but keep an extremely close eye on it. It looks on the verge of an infection. If it swells or gets more red or red lines come from it, get help ASAP. Would not ever recommend pen ink because of infection hazard and it’s quick ability to fade over time"
StopSelfHarm,exrtuaa,t1_exoji1x,1566523984.0,"Thank you, I really appreciate the words of encouragement. I keep trying to remind myself that self harm keeps me from being who I want to be but it’s still hard. I am really bad at keeping up with people but when I do it feels good so maybe I’ll try to do that with them. It’s exhausting to resist urges but I know I’m the end it’s worth it."

My screens for my windows and doors on that floor are scratched to bits. It’s also freaky as fuck when you wake up at 1 am to hear scratching and see 2 glowing red eyes staring through your window

selfharm,ewqp508,t1_ewqoikw,1565673242.0,That very encouraging to hear. I’m glad that it’s been less urges and that they only arise during certain occasions. It sounds like the hard work and therapy has been laying off for you :)
mildlyinteresting,ewqoy2i,t1_ewqoeag,1565673038.0,"Like I said, I have struggles with self harm and often need stitches. I’ve been self harming for years and the worst of it has been over the last year and a half. If I had a particularly spell of depression or anxiety  I might end up in the ER 3 or 4 times in a week. So it adds up pretty quick. In the past year and a half I’ve probably been to emerg 40 times."
selfharm,ewqo3on,t1_ewqn1zy,1565672161.0,"Wow, that must’ve been a difficult journey. Good job on being so strong and willing to change. It’s so hard to know how worried those around you get affected but I’m glad it worked for your benefit. And two years is amazing!!! I’m so happy for you!

Do you mind me asking if you still get urges occasionally?"
selfharm,ewqny5o,t1_ewqmyrw,1565672002.0,"You are a warrior. It’s amazing how persistent you’ve been in bettering yourself. From what I’ve heard the urges are there for a long time and possibly for the rest of our lives. Self harm changes our brain and reward system so of course we will experience urges similar to when we used to self harm often.

That is another interesting topic in itself, the odd urges that arise from weird triggers. Sometimes urges arise from seeing or hearing about self harm and other times it’s a totally random thing not associated with self harm.

I really hope you are doing better today. I’m sorry you had a slip up, I hope you are not discouraged. I am glad that you are already back to wanting to start fresh again :) please be proud of your accomplishments and your hard work."
StopSelfHarm,ewqniy4,t1_ewqn12p,1565671574.0,"I’m amazed and impressed by your story. The truly amazing part for me to hear is the dedication to sticking to your time frames. I really think the main struggle has been surviving it and not making things worse. So the fact that you put up time lines and stuck to them is truly a testament to your strength and will power despite continued urges to act on your thoughts.
I felt as though most people never really stop urges forever and even though it’s sad to think that, it’s also amazing to think of the continual willingness to try to get better. You appear to be very self aware and knowledgeable on yourself and that alone is impressive. Keep doing what you have been!"
StopSelfHarm,ewqlj9y,t1_ewqldi8,1565669632.0,I guess sometimes that’s what is needed. Someone to intervene. A lot of the times that I went a few months without was often due to just being too tired.
SelfHarmScars,ewqkd8n,t3_coqk2z,1565668562.0,Congrats friend! That is a true success.
sticknpokes,ewpcf3q,t3_cpe7cl,1565638168.0,Honestly just going over the lines again would make a huge difference. I like the original designs. You might have to go over it a few extra times to make sure it stick in the scar tissue but it will only take a little extra longer. To the person maybe add a few extra little details like shine marks or just thicken some of the lines.
mildlyinteresting,ewpc2c7,t3_cpcqbj,1565637948.0,"I have been to the emergency room dozens of times due to self harm most often requiring stitches. Some of the most common questions are do you smoke, do you drink, or do drugs. Then amazement on their face when I tell them I don’t smoke, drink, or do drugs is priceless. I think their shock comes from wondering how someone can do such damage while sober. Anyways it’s just interesting how uncommon it is to never drink or smoke or do drugs."

SelfHarmScars,eucpbo1,t1_eucoprp,1563682022.0,"Yes!!! Honestly people don’t notice that area as much as arms. You might still get questions but it’s worth it to feel a sense of freedom. Like I said it might be awkward the first time but I still recommend it.
Let me know how it goes! Good luck and remember you’re awesome."
SelfHarmScars,eucp2x7,t1_eucojow,1563681796.0,"I hope you aren’t talking about the fact that I have bad and obvious scars to be pretty. If that’s what you are saying, I’m sorry you feel that way. And at the same time it’s a living hell to be in that kind of “bad” self harm. It’s more courageous to continue fighting urges instead of letting them win over you. We can always try again the next day if today doesn’t work. Being clean from self harm (even for a short amount of time) has made me feel 1000 times better despite the urges to continue hurting myself worse. I hope you feel better and that you let yourself be on your own team instead of against yourself. It sucks to be your own enemy.

And if you’re saying I’m courageous because I am slowly getting over self harm, I hank you. And the part where I hope you do well is still the same. I always find so much more peace and contentment when I am working towards not falling not into my urges, but it took years to get to that point. Good luck friend, and maybe try doing something non self harm related to seek a sense of achievement."

I find it easiest to start small. Instead of going strait to a T-shirt/shorts. Wear a long sleeve but roll up the sleeves just a bit. Do this until you feel comfortable. You might also want to try to have an answer ready to give when people ask about scars. That’s the hardest part. I personally have pre thought out answers to them. Most of them I keep short and simple. We aren’t obligated to tell everyone our whole story so a simple “they are just scars” can be more than enough. 

You’ve got this. It’s taken a lot for me to feel semi okay wearing summer clothes again. It takes time and a lot of self care and self affirmation. Take your time with it. Go at your own pace. Good luck friend 😊"

Take things a day at a time or even moment by moment. You don’t have to think it by x days. Maybe think of it as getting through each urge. Take one urge at a time.

It might be good to think about what others are saying calling you strong. They wouldn’t say it if they didn’t believe it. I never understood why people said that either until I had a friend explain it to me. 

Good luck. Keep trying and don’t give up. You’ve got this. And try not to be hard on yourself when you relapse."

SelfHarmScars,ettxwlr,t1_eth6120,1563199207.0,"I do agree with what you are saying.i should’ve stated my noughts differently as it was unnecessarily aggressive.
And still at the same time I too had those thoughts, I used to look at images online as motivation to cut worse. I never vocalized them. When I read the comment it brought up a lot. I’ve had people look at my arms and say goals or I wish I could do that and it honestly irritates me. I’ve had other friends that self harm say those things and it hurt. It hurts because I become aware that I am hurting myself enough for other self harmers to see me as a goal. Having extremely noticeable scars Sucks sometimes especially when you’re trying to recover. It’s dangerous to say “I wish I could cut that deep” and like I said I’ve had those thoughts to as do many other self harmers. I still think we should be careful of saying such things. And again I agree I should’ve said things differently and lead with something kinder first and not go at her. I still stand by my point but wish I said it better."
