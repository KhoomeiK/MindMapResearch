Capitalism for the good, country life where we quickly found there was no fat of the land to live off of. More like the kindness of strangers..
From there it was down to Nashville (now with two boys) and eventually to WV where we enjoy retirement and living off the fruits of our ill-gotten gains (stock, 401k) and social security (please keep paying us; we promise it will still be there for you!)."

When my dad died, I never told him,‚ÄùI love you‚Äù because we weren‚Äôt a demonstrative family. Lame excuse. My mom died in a nursing home before we could reach her and, again, a lost opportunity. Now I make it a point to tell my loved ones that I love them. Before it‚Äôs too late.

I got a BA in Anthropology which was all well and good but I never attempted to do anything with it. I was one of those girls looking more for an Mrs degree. 
Thirdly, and this may sound cheesy but I wish I had tried harder to understand my parents, even when I disagreed. I wish I had been brave enough to see their perspective and challenge it. And I wish I had told them I loved them.
