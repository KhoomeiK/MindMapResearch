entj,fo8pgwx,t1_fo8ng3a,1587601178.0,"What you described sounds a lot like us, honestly. We had a huge struggle while adapting to the social distancing as my need of “feeling loved/cared for” required wanting him expressing it.. and that led to calls/texts and words of affirmation. I’m not proud of that need honestly and I see a lot may come from insecurities but I have no doubt I’m working on my part and I can see he is working on his also. 

“I’m also super physical so maybe the virtual love doesn’t work for me” — you’re spot on here. I didn’t realize this could maybe be something in common between my bf and I. And I think me comparing the intimacy between other couples who can just send nudes or do phone sex just took part in this insecurity because doing that just isn’t my nature."

infj,fn9f8ym,t3_g0bn5n,1586770693.0,"Hey, INFJ here. Thank you for your perspective .. I see myself in position of your friend often .. I do have many times where I will disregard texts or give very short straight to the point responses. 

Reflecting now, I see my reason for doing so is just having limits to what I invest energy, emotions and personal life in. For example, I will want to talk about deep things, but just not all the time. Having to talk “deep” all the time can be emotionally draining and .. since we are private, most of the time we just want our lives and intentions to be kept private because not all the time we are understood for why we do things, which leads to a lot of explaining .. following by being drained.  

Most of the time with friendships, we are not only looking for understanding and seriousness to our “hidden sides” .. but we are looking for a friendship where we can be ourselves in all aspects (being weird, learning something new, gaining new ideas, taking on a challenge, growth, etc). It may seem that you come to her to be understood about your serious sides and perhaps that may come off to her as draining because then she feels as if she has to give the same back, but instead has set her limits."

I also find myself upset when I wake up or go to sleep without a message. He also has larger family at home but keeps to himself mostly with his dog. He studies, plays games and of course has a social life. So I guess I get insecure possibly because I lack that healthy social balance and sometimes have these thoughts that he invests his emotional energy or interest in others. We video chat whenever we study, we have some conversations about school, sometimes joke around, but it feels like there is just something lacking. It feels like he is more obligated to do so because of how I expressed I needed this. I question if he even misses me. Could be my insecurity side expressing this. 

I try to keep myself busy, I study, take free online courses, learning how to code, dance, workout - I’m the only child, no dog (wish I did but I’m not stable to take good care of it yet) .. anything to try and “work on myself” during this period - but for some reason I think I just feel insecure because of how he isn’t very expressive with his words. We actually talked about it but it leads to frustration. 

I think I’m passive and react more to what I need indirectly. Such as showing more of my upset side that he is lacking something I need rather than properly communicating it. 

Would you be able to give me an example of how you communicated your needs?"

“Are you okay? I have a gut feeling something is wrong.”

Our relationship ended in 2014, no contact at all since 2018 (my huge breaking point where things have changed for me) - we caught up and he actually communicated how he would have these gut feelings - he did pop in again like that in 2019 when I was at a breaking point. Then 2020 he did happen to again coincidentally. He sent me a link about soulmate and that’s where I found out  and thought is it really a thing?"
