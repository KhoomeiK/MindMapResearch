Sure.  Almost everything we do is selfish.  As long as it doesn't directly hurt others, though, there shouldn't be a problem.

At the very least, I think that as the population increases and technology makes music production and reach easier, the number of people wanting to be musicians and make music grows much faster than how many musicians are needed to fill the wants of most music listeners.

People don't really follow local music scenes anymore.  Spotify gives them access to anything, and your average person doesn't go to live shows very much (in my observation).

This subconsciously taught me that I don't have a chance, so I have ""un-confident"" mannerisms such as looking away or not being quite myself around attractive women.

It gets worse and worse as you get rejected over and over, making you less attractive, even though your looks haven't changed.  There's just nothing that stands out about someone shying away who would clearly be grateful for a chance with a woman.

For people who had success early on, they are taught that they belong, so they have that douchey type-A swagger to them that - no matter how obnoxious it is - just works.  It's an attractive way of behaving that can't really be faked, because it works on a very biological level."

depression,fai69b1,t3_e9dgix,1576100718.0,"That sounds awful.  I'm really sorry to hear that happened.  People can be so goddam horrible sometimes, it's really frustrating.  When I was in undergrad, my girlfriend's roommate stole from both of us and I never understood how someone could do that to another person.

As to your question of how to stop feeling so terrible, I'd say it's partially just time and partially recognizing that this situation is not the end of the world.  In fact, you're on the cusp of starting the next phase of your life.  

You're going to graduate.  You're going to eventually be able to pick yourself up and get a job.  It may be a struggle for a while, yes, but then you'll be at a point in your life where you have more freedom and independence then you ever had with roommates and classes.  

A lot of time on this forum people will say ""it's going to get better!"" and it comes off as really shallow and thoughtless.  Here, though, I think my message is appropriate.  You have every reason to think that a year from now you can be in a better place than you are now, and you can articulate how that is possible:  Graduate.  Job.  Financial Stability.  Live on own. 

You can do this."
depression,fai3p1q,t3_e9d7jz,1576099194.0,"Without knowing anymore, all I can guess is that you are still alive because someday you may find love.  Love and acceptance can be amazing.  It can make all the shit that life throws at you somehow bearable.  

I feel really lonely, too.  On top of that, I got my heart absolutely stomped on this past weekend by someone who I considered a friend who lead me to believe I might have found love and then abandoned me with no closure or explanation.  In a lifetime of loneliness I'm not sure I've ever felt this alone.

Not trying to one-up you on the misery scale, just trying to relate.  The thing is, I know I still believe that someday I can get that real connection I'm looking for.  I don't know how or how long it will be, but I know there's a chance.

That said, if it happened once it certainly can happen again, and almost definitely can be a better situation for you.  It might not be tomorrow, and it might not be this year, but you have features that at least one cute girl was able to find attractive.  

Think of it in terms of statistics.  If we measured how attractive every girl that meets you finds you and made a bell curve of it, we now have at least one girl who was far enough away from center to want to get with you.  The odds of her being the absolute end of the bell curve are certainly lower than the odds of there being some more girls out there who find you as - or more - attractive, unless you've met everyone already."

Now that I'm very much in favor of.  I think you'd see total suicides drop if that were allowed and actually supported by people.  You want to commit suicide?  Go to a clinic and explain why, then set a follow up appointment where you'll choose the date you can get the self-administered treatment. 

Really, everyone wants to cut down on compulsive suicides, and the promise of a painless death without the risk of becoming a vegetable could go a long way to that if it makes people think about the situation for a while."

>I never said that suicidal people automatically don't have the capacity to consent to treatment, I said it would need to be assessed.

Sure, but you also said that their being deemed to have capacity would be a ""big if"".  And this is from you, who is trying to be someone who understands both sides.  The reality is that it would almost never happen.  So I'll concede that I should have said ""assuming that suicidal people *almost never have* the capacity to make their own choices for treatment is furthering the stigma.""

I agree with you that it should be a priority for our culture to have more resources available, but I'm far more skeptical about people's ability to actually empathize and overcome the stigma we've built."

My thing is that I always knew my life had *some* value.  I think my job is pointless and stupid, but if nobody did it that would be bad.  

However, if I wasn't around, somebody else would get hired and do the job at least as well as me.

Maybe you are a very good violist, and kudos if that's the case.  If the Rolling Stones had a different singer than Mick Jagger, they'd probably be a noticeably worse and less famous band for it.

And who would you allow to do the deeming, since the person is not allowed to choose for themselves? No one understands the person's circumstances better than themselves.  You're going to get doctors who either are always against it or who are trying to be activists for it.
