insaneparents,fprg9wp,t1_fpre4kn,1588853334.0,"You sound like an absolute clown. They're being downvoted because they set up their ""question"" by denying the existence of trans youth knowing they're trans by calling it a delusion. Not to mention the edit they made is rude, and no one actually willing to learn and understand will say ""Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™m being downvoted for asking a question. Really makes me wanna learn shit thanks :)"" when criticized for using outdated and insulting language towards the subject they so badly want to ""learn"" about."
insaneparents,fprfm9q,t1_fprbo9j,1588852819.0,"You're being downvoted because there are a million resources which show that trans people allowed to transition and, in most cases for younger children, be on beta blockers leads to a drastic drop in suicide rates and mental health issues. You're simply being lazy and asking people who comment here in support of this girl to validate her existence. Also, you're completely mistaken if you think it is in any way easy for a trans person (in most places) to get hormones and surgery, a lot of consultation is done and even then, doctors will *still* reject a trans patient simply because they don't think the patient is trans, and is just confused. It takes a lot of time and money for a trans person to transition, and this process typically isn't started until the patient's late teens, when they have been sure that they are a different gender for a while.

Dysphoria could be classified as a mental disorder but it certainly isn't a delusion and when children have other urgent mental conditions that put them at extreme risk for suicide and self harm it's not ""enabling"" anything to treat them. 

Here are a few studies and resources that could help you.

relationship_advice,flbu5yk,t1_flbodm7,1585012680.0,"Sitz means seated in german so I would assume it's a bath with just enough water to sit in, without being a full bath. I would *not* recommend using any salts or bath additives until the area has completely healed, as those can cause infections or sensitivity!

edit: A quick google search tells me it is indeed a shallow, warm bath that can help infections and unease/discomfort of the genitals and perineum."
