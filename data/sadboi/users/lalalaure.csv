I started gardening a couple of years ago both inside and outside. It started with succulents and cacti. 

I'm sowing seeds and planting fruit trees outside way more than last year and my goal is to make the garden food forest :)
I grow avocados, succulents, cacti, bamboo, some little interesting looking trees inside.


People always tell me ""do what makes you happy"" and with my mental health problems, this used to mean just sleeping my days away - usually followed by guilt until a couple of months ago.

However, getting connected to nature, moving my body during the gardening work, working with soil, seeing the small lives, how strong they are etc. really bring me joy. I'm truly happy doing gardening.

It's amazing looking at how resilient succulents are!


Also, I already started making pesto using herbs in my garden and get my salad leaves from the balcony. I even brew homemade herbal tea now.
This is very rewarding and I'm so happy I got to find this hobby."

raisedbynarcissists,fpunuh0,t3_gfhza9,1588918048.0,"This might be slightly off topic but here's my story:

When I was 8, I vented in my notebook just writing my feelings for pages. Mostly anger but also fears about my (now deceased) Nmom. 
I even wrote ""I want her to die"" because to me, she was a scary monster. 

Then she found and read all of it. 

Our relationship got way worse to the point it was impossible to get any worse. This state kept being the same for years.

She told everyone about it. She started becoming even more hostile to me all the time. 

I felt guilty so I wrote ""I'm sorry"" for pages in the same notebook. I didn't mean it. She read it. Didn't change anything.

I wrote that because that little girl wanted to save herself from an abuser.


Since I grew up in a monolingual country (Japan), this sort of led me to immersing myself in my second language which is English. 
Like some other people here saying they make their own alphabets to hide what they write, I used my second language. 

To other people, it just looked like I was being a good child studying another language. 
For me, it was a matter of survival.

All the musical I listened to was not in my native language either. 

I never thank my childhood for my ability but it helped me survive in some way. 

However, as a result, I'm scared of my first language today.
I can't help associating it with the scary reality I had to go through. It's so cold to me. It reminds me of the abuse.

We have some neighbours but we're far away from each other and all my neighbours are extremely quiet and shy.

I wish I had a cat. Most of my friends live outside my country and even to meet the closest friend, I have take an hour trip. Going to a library, which I have to do as a student is also a big trip too.


The community in my area is full of close minded old people (or boomers, if you will). Unfortunately, they're judgemental, sexist and favours old people. 


It sucks not being able to meet your friends but I definitely choose where I live/rural area and off grid over suburban and urban area even there's this seclusion.

socialskills,fkiv41u,t3_fiinee,1584229358.0,"Japanese native here. I can't answer your questions about going beyond superficial since I don't have an experience living somewhere trying to make friends speaking their language but I do feel I wish I could speak more speaking languages that are not my mother tongue (German and French, I used to volunteer at the guesthouse for years and still visit them). 

From my experience as a Japanese uni student (though I'm a distance learner, not full time) who's quite introverted, it's hard for me to make friends too. 

I know maybe in a different way but it's hard for me to find people who ""resonates"" with me. Also, they never approach me first unless I talk to them first but it gets better after the second or third time. 

Some people prefer to stick to friends they've already made and not actively seek for other ones too.

Even when I get somewhat beyond superficial with them, I just find myself trying too hard to fit in after all. I have a quite a few contacts of people my age from uni on LINE and I don't text them unless it's about studies...lol

I go to my campus about 3 weeks straight in August and a couple of time per year for exams. They do have gatherings many times a year but I just don't go since the atmosphere gets too loud to speak in the first place. 

If you want to learn to speak more fluently, it's a very good idea to tell them so. 
You don't have to be advanced, but lots of conversations can come from language related topics. You can try language exchange too, which I think is the best way in my opinion. For example, if they happen to like films you like, you can go to the cinema etc. You can dig deeper from there if they show interests.

 Maybe they feel like they want to speak to you but they're not confident about their English so they might feel too intimidated...? 
It's important to stick to it. I know it's hard. 

That's usually the case for us in general. 
Ultimately, people who become interested in you would go beyond superficial and I think it's an universal thing. It takes time to go beyond superficial.

I'm sorry if these are things you've already tried of already knew. I really wanted to help since I speak English and I'm a student as well.

Even as s native, I get socially burnt out very often both with my friends with English as their first language and friends who are Japanese natives.

tarot,fia5gs1,t3_f4pw19,1582293475.0,"Temperance card has been showing up in my reading very frequently. It's almost being stalked by the card.
It doesn't matter what I ask: relationship, daily reading, studying (I'm a student), life in general etc.
It appears every time.
It's usually in reverse most of the time.
I don't really know what this could mean in general. 

I thought this could be balancing out between private life and studying, I might have been too inclined to my private aspects in my life but it still keeps showing up even though I started focus on studying way more. 
Any interpretation would be appreciated.

Edit: deck is Rider-Waite."

Anyway, just because you're a witch or anything special, it doesn't mean the earth is yours. 
Being respectful to your irreplaceable home should come first. 
The earth not is for witches or/and people to exploit. 

I see so much hypocrisy especially in the community. I believe these precious things should stay in the planet's body and leave the mother earth alone (in this context)."

realwitchcraft,fh80lvf,t1_fh7wjlx,1581349338.0,"I second this. I reckon being in a different sleep  environment (for this case, the smell) can cause your body doing some kind of adjustment to an unfamiliar thing.
 Just like what you dream about can be affected by the temperature of your body and room. Or eating a certain kind of cheese causing a nightmare.

I don't think the scent of bay leaves are generally not as helpful for relaxation as lavender, sweet orange, rose etc. so that might be the case too.

Personally, I would think it's something more physical and mental than energetic or spiritual thing."

It turned out we've shared multiple same thoughts about the situation and the talk made me glad that I trusted him.

5. Not having kids is one of the best ways to combat climate change and the world is literally on fire. I won't rant here as much I want to but I can't believe people are still willing to have kids when the future is in danger.

7. My mother was extremely abusive for my first 17 years of my life until she died.

I have mental illnesses (depression and anxiety. My mother had more and severe) like she did and personally, I don't want to pass on my genes.
