However, you shouldn’t just stop taking it. That could induce worse side effects. If you want to stop it, you need to taper it down, especially if you’re at the maximum dose of 450 mg. Talk to your doctor about it. There’s a titration schedule you should follow (you can find it online if you search for it by that name).

Here’s the relevant passage:

> An important adverse event associated with bupropion use is seizure. With the IR formulation, the rate is 0.4% (4/1000) at doses of 300 to 450 mg/day; however, the rate increases substantially at doses above this level. With the SR formulation, the rate is 0.1% (1/1000) at the target dose of 300 mg/day. The incidence of seizure with bupropion XL has not been evaluated. Bupropion is not the only antidepressant associated with seizures. SSRI antidepressants are associated with seizure at a similar rate of approximately 0.1%. Certain factors may increase the risk of seizure; therefore, prior to the prescription of bupropion, patients should be screened for the presence of medical comorbidities, clinical situations, or concomitant medications that may lower seizure threshold.

So, if you’re at risk for having seizures, you shouldn’t take Wellbutrin (especially not at the maximum dose). You’re more likely to have a seizure on Wellbutrin than on an SSRI, but it’s a nearly insignificant difference of three-tenths of one percent."
bupropion,fdp2jsj,t3_emi709,1578618480.0,"It’s helped me with a lot of those sort of things (ruminating, intrusive thoughts that I can’t shake) but it is known to sometimes increase anxiety. You have very little to lose by trying the medication. Give it six weeks at full dose before you decide if it’s helping. (In other words, if your doctor prescribed 150 mg, give it six weeks at that dose. If you doctor wants you to take 150 mg, then slowly increase it, give it six weeks at the target dose.)

As for those types of thoughts: it would help to learn coping skills, one of which is to challenge them. So what if you’re gay? Who decides what kind of thoughts are normal to have? That sort of thing. 

Another skill is try to focus on the here and now: breathe deeply and completely. Notice the things around you, and describe them in your mind. An easy way to do this is with a piece of food like a candy or a cookie. What does it smell like? What does it look like? What does it taste like? Answer those questions in detail in your mind. 

That helps kick you out of the anxious spiral, and then you can readdress those types of questions when you’re not freaking out anymore. 

If you’re concerned that something you want to take (illegal and legal drugs alike) might interact with this medication, the [drugs.com interactions checker](https://www.drugs.com/drug_interactions.html) is a good resource. 

On weed use: I quit using it just as I started taking bupropion, so I can’t tell you from experience, but the drugs.com interactions checker doesn’t say the two interact. I found that using weed that frequently was making my depression and anxiety worse, so I stopped with the intention of eventually restarting, but using it far less. It’s generally a good practice to stop using it for a little while when you start a new medication so that you can see what the medication is doing on its own, so that you know if it’s helping. 

As for alcohol: with many antidepressants, it’s dangerous to combine them with alcohol in large amounts. Ask your doctor if you’re concerned about this, because generally you can drink somewhat, but it depends on the dose, your weight, etc. Your doctor should be the one to make that call, not a stranger on the Internet. (If you’re in the US) your doctor cannot tell anyone you’re breaking the law (i.e. underage drinking) unless you tell them you’re planning on intentionally hurting yourself or someone else.

I’m prescribed ambien for when I have trouble sleeping, but another drug I take weakens its effect, so I’ve started taking Benadryl (diphenhydramine). Wellbutrin makes Benadryl stronger, so I get a powerful sleepy feeling with just 25 mg. But, Benadryl is very dehydrating."

I went back to my normal appetite and metabolism after stopping it. I could’ve lived with being heavier, but I got a rare muscle spasm side effect that I couldn’t stand. After a few weeks of gradually losing weight, I began taking Wellbutrin, which curbs appetite, and the weight just fell off.

Don’t be too alarmed by the “major” interaction warning, as the two can be taken together in a safe dosage, and if your doctor has you on these two, s/he picked a safe dosage. 

Also, I wouldn’t drink at all when taking these. Especially if you’re doing so heavily. There are possibilities of bad side effects. 

Taking them together amplifies then effect of the lexapro. SSRIs, of which lexapro is one, are all known for decreasing sex drive and function. Wellbutrin is one of very few antidepressants of any kind which does not do this. But, again, when taken together, the lexapro is amplified, so that’s probably behind your sexual issue. 

Wellbutrin is often found to help increase drive and motivation, but of course these things are not true of all people. 

I have consumed a lot of cannabis while on Lexapro, but not on Wellbutrin, and I didn’t find any interaction between those two. I was able to get high as easily as ever. I did find, though, that when I was regularly using (high THC) cannabis heavily, it increased those feelings of not being able to be productive, feeling helpless, and feeling very depressed until long after I came down from the high. (Days, even weeks after.) Not all people respond that way, though, but people with emotional disorders tend to respond differently to cannabis than most others. Just something to take into consideration. 

I found that, especially at higher doses, Wellbutrin is very good at fixing lack of motivation and focus issues. 

You should definitely tell your doctor all this, because it sounds like you’re not satisfied with your current drug regimen. Lexapro is very good for some people, but I seem to hear you saying it’s not working for you, as most of those symptoms are either caused by or not helped by that drug."

depression,fbtsxkm,t1_fbtq2g5,1577094126.0,"This is the truth. It can really cloud your perception of reality, which makes depression far worse.

Every once and a while I’d quit for a few days, feel much better, and figure it must be something else that changed. Then I’d get some more weed, and suddenly my depression would get bad again. Eventually I made the connection, and a little while after that I allowed myself to admit it."

adderall,fbts5ne,t3_eegi2b,1577092932.0,"To help get you to sleep, you could try a few non-medication things: behavioral changes like following a rigid schedule, where you go up to bed to calm down at least an hour before you intend to sleep. You could try chamomile tea to help relax you, or taking supplements of melatonin, which is a naturally occurring hormone in the body which helps begin the process of getting to sleep. 

But, I’ve found medication, when paired with behavioral changes, made the biggest difference for me. You may not want to pile on the drugs, and you shouldn’t want to. I didn’t before, but doing so has drastically improved my quality of life. 

There’s a drug called Remeron (mirtazapine). It’s an antidepressant which increases appetite — drastically, in my case. Not all medication affects everyone the same, but the appetite stimulation is very common. It was astoundingly good at that for me. I gained 40 pounds in five months. That’s no exaggeration; I keep track of my weight closely. I went from being underweight to overweight. It’s one of the most effective antidepressants out there, so if you take one already, you may prefer this. 

Remeron makes a lot of people drowsy, so it can help get you to sleep. That’s a side effect of it. I didn’t find I got much of that, but many people do.

On the sleep cycle issue: I’ve had a similar problem all my life, but it happened to me all the time, regardless of whether I took a sleep medication or not. I get into an incredibly deep sleep, and I completely don’t respond to alarms. I’ve found Wellbutrin to completely cure this in me. I now sleep a reasonable amount of time (sometimes less, but that’s a trade off I’m willing to make) and then wake up naturally. Not all doctors will prescribe Wellbutrin and Adderall together, because taking the two in a high dose can be dangerous. As I understand it, you can do that if you limit the dose of the two, but your doctor should make that call. Wellbutrin and Adderall are similar in effect, and for that reason Wellbutrin is sometimes prescribed off-label for ADHD, as an alternative to stimulants. It’s not as effective in most people as Adderall for that purpose, though. The reason, I think, that it helps prevent my corpse-like sleep state is that the version of it that I take is a 24 hour extended release. Few other drugs that can treat ADHD which I’m aware of act for that long, meaning that few can offer that benefit. Stimulants like Adderall don’t come in this form. They’d probably make it completely impossible to sleep if they did. 

When I have trouble getting to sleep, I take Ambien. That way I can force a healthy sleep cycle onto myself no matter what. But I know you said that may not work for you.  

Again, taking a lot of medication isn’t always ideal, but it’s worked better than anything else ever has for me. These aren’t all things you’d take the same time, though. Some of these are duplicative.

My doctor suggested propranolol, a beta blocker that reduces anxiety. The anxiety does lessen as you continue to take Wellbutrin, so the propranolol is only a temporary measure to get through the first two weeks or so. It’s Rx only, but it doesn’t have particularly awful potential side effects, so a doctor would likely feel comfortable prescribing it unless you have a heart condition it would interact with. Call your doctor for advice or a prescription if the anxiety is really bad. 

If the anxiety continues to be really bad after a few weeks, you may either want to consider stopping Wellbutrin, or taking something to treat that symptom. Again, let your doctor know."

I don’t feel any nausea anymore, though it does get rid of my appetite, and my stomach hurts if I don’t make myself eat at least something.

Brain fog and lack of energy were my two worst symptoms, and this medication has gone a long way in helping them. The stronger dose has cleared them away more powerfully.

I’ve found bupropion to be really helpful for me. We all respond to these things differently, though, so the fact that it’s worked for me doesn’t mean it will work for you. Because of this, no one can tell you exactly what the stronger dose would be like for you."

If you can talk to your doctor — either your psychiatrist or your regular physician — do that. There are things they could prescribe to treat the symptoms you’re feeling until you get over this, which there’s no reason to think you won’t. 

Unfortunately, the way I had to get through the cold turkey period was by treating it like I was sick, which I basically was. I spent a few days in bed, drinking plenty of fluids, and rode it out. It absolutely sucks. I realize that’s not always a possibility, but I was lucky enough at the time that it was. 

If I remember correctly, I think my doctor said at the time that it takes three weeks for it to completely pass from the body, but it became tolerable to the point that I could go back to life after — I think? — roughly 14 days. I was still getting unexplained anxiety after that, but it wasn’t terrible. 

If by BPD you mean bipolar disorder: I do too, and I think it must interact with that in some weird way, because it felt like one crazy manic episode the whole time. I’ve never been prone to mania that bad before or since.
