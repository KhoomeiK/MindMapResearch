At the time he used to allude pretty frequently at how often he used to have sex with women.

Fast-forward 2-3 (?) years, a coming-out as a trans woman and the subsequent transition, and his latest video, titled ""Shame"" - yet another autobiographic babble. In it, he talks about how awfully hard it was for him to accept that he liked women, because he never would've imagined being a lesbian as he really wanted to be a real, complete, good woman. He actually goes as far as describing his experience as ""compulsory heterosexuality"", a term coined to describe the social brain-washing that lesbians experience from birth and that makes them feel like they have to love men. Never mind his 30+ years identifying as a man who loved women, the pride he displayed around his obsession for pussy, and the utter lack of shame, stigma, or mystery associated with his sexual orientation in his formative years. He finishes the video fantasising about a future where lesbians will all love dick. That's his ""coming out as a gay woman"" video.

And although Contrapoints is an especially extreme case study in narcissism, drug-fried brain and disconnection from reality, I think this example says a lot about how many trans people approach ""being gay"""

I think this part is about wanting to fit in to an ideal life - the palace within her dreams that they're all living in, that is now *in ruins*, because part of growing up is accepting that life is not as glamorous as some media might make it seem (she's over getting told to throw her hands up in the air because life is not as simple as being happy when a songs tells you to, she's older than she was when she ""rebelled without a care""). So they're still competing for the love of the palace, basically begging for this ideal life to be accessible, but the palace wants release: the idea has to be left behind.

The lines before that prepare that I guess, the broken cups leaving shards beneath their feet symbolise the shattering of these illusions, but it's not her fault - you can't escape the disillusion of growing up, it's just going to happen.

\- The counter-protest by TRAs of an anti-rape demonstration in Manchester. So, [basically a pro-rape protest.](https://twitter.com/tibby17/status/1226211312302252034)

\- The use of [smoke bombs to terrorize women](https://www.womenarehuman.com/womens-meeting-greeted-by-masked-protesters-smoke-grenades-and-flashing-penis/) in a community that had been previously destroyed by the loss of many lives to a fire (Grenfell Tower)

\- The increasing mental health issues faced by lesbians who are being told they need to like penis, otherwise they will be ostracized from their communities and seen as subhuman bigots. I've seen firsthand the distress caused to some very young lesbians who were pressured into sleeping with transwomen by what should have been a supportive community.

\- The increased silencing of women in ""feminist"" circles who dare speak about issues concerning female anatomy.

\-  The replacement of sex-based language with gender-based language in all contexts, making it impossible to talk about sex-based oppression, sex-based socialisation without misrepresenting the problem as a simple issue of identity.

\- Not to be the one defending men but this really also bothers me in relation to my male friends and every decent male out there. This insistence that trans status/identity magically makes transwomen safe for females to be around implies that ""cis"" status makes non-trans males intrinsically dangerous. See, it's not the way we raise men that is a problem. It's their innate identity, they're monsters. And women are submissive and make good victims by nature, since socialisation is a wild TERF fantasy.

\- The election of a transwoman as the UK Labour Party Women's Officer. Lily Madigan has no idea of female issues because f their biology, not even a slight idea of sex harassment experienced by women as they look like a teenage boy. A male person whose sole connection to womanhood is the way they dress was deemed a good choice to represent women.

\- The threats of violence from transwomen in various feminist demonstrations across the world this year, the calls to violence against ""TERFs"" (aka females who don't want to pretend their oppression is not based on sex, and/or lesbians who do not want to force themselves to like males) which makes discussions of feminist issues impossible in feminist spaces.

GCdebatesQT,fmw5wm8,t3_fxmwrr,1586440230.0,"To be quite honest, I know I'm talking to potential rapists and very likely rape sympathizers every time I talk to males. It was downright horrifying to see how open people were about it in this sub, but growing up female kinda desensitised me to it.

Is there a point? I don't know, I don't think there's a way to change the minds of people who have a validating hugbox to run to the minute they need to hear that they are the victims and that those dirty females only want to literally murder them with words. But I came here when the cognitive dissonance of trying to make libfem views on gender fit with my contradictory life experience started to become unbearable and the comments by people like u/LoveSloane, u/SqueakyBall, u/Hypocritical-Cunt or u/Manaxium (and many other, I'm just bad at usernames) helped a lot. I don't think I'm debating to change the QT side's mind about anything, I'm debating for the lurkers to see they've been brainwashed about what T\*RFs are."
GCdebatesQT,fmpj1nr,t3_fwevj0,1586281721.0,"I feel awful for the females growing up right now, who are being treated like shit because of their sex and simultaneously told that all of this - the violence, the oppression, everything - is a question of *identity*. That male socialisation goes away with a dress as easily as female oppression becomes privilege with enough testosterone. I would feel as if I participated in their collective gaslighting if I respected the preferred pronouns of violent, abusive, or even ""just"" dismissive and misogynistic males."
GCdebatesQT,fmmgw6b,t1_fmmfycv,1586205044.0,"Did you miss the Twitter storm that the original piece granted its author? Half of the posts on egg_irl? The accounts of detransitioners or people such as myself who, I repeat, have been pressured to identify as the opposite sex for having the sheer audacity of not being a walking stereotype? Do you think the handful of trans people who post here are a reliable sample of the diverse attitudes trans people can have?"
GCdebatesQT,fmmfofx,t1_fmmaogm,1586204415.0,"Good for you for being ""one of the good ones"" I guess? Still doesn't erase the fact that a lot of trans people see GNC people, traumatised women, and people with internalised homophobia as an opportunity to push transition as some sort of inconsequential cure to all life problems."
GCdebatesQT,fmm9lhi,t1_fmlmhxq,1586201324.0,">We aren't the ones trying to tell people what gender to live as.

What do you mean by that? Because a lot of trans people love pressuring their friends into ""identifying as nonbinary"" or outright transitioning because hey, you can so you might as well do! I had to set a harsh boundary myself because a trans male friend absolutely wanted me to wear a binder; and this sub is full of women with similar experiences."

Thank you for putting more thought into this than the average person would. I think r/GCdebatesQT could help you?

I don't know of any ""global name"" to get a big picture of all the practices (would absolutely love to though), but for the Mexican practice you can try key words like ""limpia"" (cleansing) or ""brujeria"" (witchcraft) along with egg. In Italy it's part of a folk catholic magic group of practices called ""Benedicaria"". ""Egg cleasing"" did give me some results though."
truebisexuals,flvu1mp,t3_frhfgh,1585532107.0,"I think pansexuality is a label that people invented to avoid facing their internalised biphobia. Falling in love with a person's personality? When has this been something bisexuals, or any other sexuality cannot do? Pansexuality is their way of saying ""yes, I like people of *all genders* (literally means the same as ""both sexes"" but sounds less inclusive uwu), but I'm not a sex-crazed, genital-obsessed, cheating scheming whore like *those* bisexuals.""

It's claiming the experience without being willing to deconstruct the prejudices or build solidarity with the rest of your community. It's a way of throwing other bisexuals under the bus to gain a sense of moral superiority. Rejecting the word and the stigma attached to it because it's way easier than to fight biphobia. A liberal identity at its finest."
