Well that showed some coordination and I could speculate that since Buttigieg was hesitant it was Obama's call that sealed the deal.

 I mean guys, we all agree that our politics are corrupted only now when, yknow a complete antiestablishment, anti war, anti corporate, anti profiteering candidate is being worked against, not to say it's some crazy conspiracy and he couldnt be allowed to win, but just worked against, everyone right of Bernie wants to say ""Where is the evidence?

Because it's done by the government does not make it inherently socialist. Fascism can be democratic. Otherwise any step by govt to do anything with tax dollars is socialism which just isn't accurate. Socialists were murdered by nazis and expelled from power.

Warren says some things and reacts in some ways I personally find unappealing from a politician. To compare to Bernie, he maintains a pretty cool head, even when asked tough questions by reporters, one exception is when discussing policy and the state of the lower classes in America. That signals to me he is passionate along w record. Warren for example, used to a Republican, which points to me her core beliefs are maybe slightly left of a republican a few decades ago, purely market solutions and taxation as deterrence to lobbying(enshrines it as revenue bad idea, corps can outspend grassroots orgs.). Idk she seems to have copied Bernie's platform to a great extent and even thrown him and their alliance, friendship, whatever youd call it, for a shot in an admin or in the establishment. Likely she believes in herself and ideas. Her willingness to compromise values she espouses is the one that breaks the camel's back.

Coronavirus,fhd1sm3,t1_fhcov87,1581475483.0,Are you a brit? (Hope that's not offensive). I'm here in the states and yeah Donald is a fucking joke. Our Justice system's top lawyer is taking on Donnie related cases now *sigh*. What's this train news & what is COBRA?
China_Flu,fhd1eny,t1_fhczaa3,1581475253.0,Could've been unrelated. In US we have body boxes made for 3 in stockpile. Considering Chinas difference in disposing of the deceased sending 3 children in one body bag isn't unsurprising. Also countries have millions of body bags on standby. I am almost positive they aren't running short on bodybags.
China_Flu,fhcymi7,t1_fhcxyfr,1581473604.0,Body bags weren't biohazard color and also kids were dressed the same. Idk if its virus related
politics,fhcvutl,t1_fhcvavj,1581471933.0,Why
politics,fhcvu2e,t1_fhcvawd,1581471920.0,"Agree, I never considered it but this would probably be a fantastic ticket."
politics,fhcv21e,t1_fhctl45,1581471450.0,Yeah 2 person race VS 5 serious candidates and 3 garnering pretty good support. Hm? Shouldnt he be performing worse?
politics,fhcuyu0,t1_fhctlhx,1581471398.0,Isn't that frustrating. NO OTHER candidate was there like that. He has consistently been fighting for the changes we so praise before it was a popular position of politicians of the issues times.
