That stereotype was started due to the publicity that surrounded Ted Bundy when he was found out. At the time, he subverted all notions of what a killer was because of how eloquent and charismatic he was. 

As a matter of fact, Gary Ridgway (who was America‚Äôs most prolific serial killer until just recently) allegedly had an IQ that was in the low 80‚Äôs."

That‚Äôs the frame of reference in which I wanted my post/comment to be viewed."
Showerthoughts,fpf2wxk,t1_fpf1s8h,1588560527.0,"Thank you sir, and I agree with a lot of your points there. Serial killers are a breed that seemed to have peaked back in the 70s and 80s, at least in the US. I‚Äôve heard a number of theories as to why. Could be because of the prevalence of hitchhiking back then... That, coupled with the relative absence of surveillance, like you said. 

Another interesting one I‚Äôve heard is that the Great Depression and WWII created cultural and socioeconomic conditions that produced a higher rate of people with killing propensities. Poverty, for instance, seems to go hand in hand with abuse and having an abusive upbringing is one of the largest threads connecting serial killers from that era. And I‚Äôve heard it theorized loosely that we could be due for another ‚Äòwave‚Äô of serial killers sometime in the future due to the economic recession that happened in 2008. 

It‚Äôs fascinating stuff."
