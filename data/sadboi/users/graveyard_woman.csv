LifeAfterNarcissism,fqmj67u,t1_fqmhqc2,1589478314.0,"I‚Äôm glad you realize that and take some of the power back!

In my experience, the harassment was just worse when I was more laxed about my social media privacy. I feel like it was allowing her to keep checking on us and grow more and more obsessive. She saw us having happy moments and doing fun things with our friends and just lashed out continuously, I guess trying to wreck things for us.

And give our narc a SHRED of info and lord knows what she‚Äôll do with it. I posted about my dad having a car accident once, and she used his name and I guess maybe a news article about the accident to track down his employer and job title. Scary."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fqmhayo,t1_fqmh1ek,1589477440.0,"I feel like there‚Äôs definitely a spectrum for narcs! Some are not nearly as bad as others. 

I will say though, most narcs are obsessive over their exes. And her attempting to follow you or check in on your life is just an example of an attempt to feel in ‚Äúcontrol.‚Äù"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fqmgvbv,t1_fqmgofe,1589477238.0,I totally understand. They love to pop in their victims‚Äô lives after months and months.
LifeAfterNarcissism,fqme93z,t3_girqb7,1589476000.0,Don‚Äôt respond to the narc or his flying monkeys. I‚Äôm sure he became very convincing to her when she found out about his abuse. There was one point and time when you believed the narc‚Äôs lies too. Just ignore them! It won‚Äôt do you any good to argue.
LifeAfterNarcissism,fqmdza2,t3_giaqst,1589475873.0,"Definitely a fake account. Our narc SEVERELY stalked us for multiple years. So eventually I put my profile on complete lockdown. I don‚Äôt accept requests from anyone I don‚Äôt know and block anyone who associates with the narc. It can be exhausting but I feel less anxious. 

Our narc has made... gosh probably dozens of fake accounts to harass us or attempt to establish communications. IGNORE THEM!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fqmdl0z,t3_gjfk92,1589475686.0,"Don‚Äôt give him the attention he craves by fighting the rumors. Because you‚Äôll never ‚Äúwin.‚Äù You know the truth and those who love you know too. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs important. I know it‚Äôs easier said than done, but you need to let his believers come to the truth themselves. Cognitive dissonance is real.

I dealt with our narc‚Äôs smear campaigns for four years. And they absolutely affected my husband and my lives... my husband lost job opportunities and longtime friends. but I always rose above the narc‚Äôs and kept my mouth shut. I knew that one day they truth would be plain as day. 

*Backstory: my now husband slept with a narc a few times when we‚Äôd first met, many years ago... and she became utterly obsessed with us/him after he chose to be with me. She began using social media to accuse BOTH of us of various ‚Äúabuses.‚Äù We were harassed for months and months by those who believed her. It was awful. I was close to committing suicide to escape it.

But eventually, our narc‚Äôs lies became so outlandish... like: I was ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù her and I had a ‚Äúteam‚Äù hacking her computers and emails each day, and my husband was wanted by the fbi for printing counterfeit money... AND he does gay porn. Lol. 

She posted all of this stuff on her Facebook and Instagram while also coming to my office and home, harassing our friends and family, posting racist and sexist things online, vandalizing our property and making fake social media accounts to harass us, and even sending my husband multiple long winded word salad ‚Äúapologies,‚Äù begging him to talk to her.

Now, I‚Äôve had several of her former flying monkeys reach out to apologize to me because it‚Äôs clear now that our narc was completely fabricating everything.

One main reason our peers and community realized this is because narcs don‚Äôt only lie about their victims, they also lie about their entire lives. My narc is (apparently) rich, talented, and famous... owns mansions and fancy cars, she‚Äôs a certifiable ‚Äúgenius,‚Äù and has all these ‚Äúfans‚Äù and admirers... lol. all of this can be easily disproven by anyone. 

Another reason is because narcs tend to acquire more and more victims over time and attempt to triangulate them to keep them from communicating. Once our narc‚Äôs other victims got in touch with me, she became grossly outsmarted. And now I have a group of lovely female friends as a result. 

Now, my narc has no friends, no one will associate or work with her in our city, most of her family has exiled her, she has no job, and I believe her husband is divorcing her... so there goes her ‚Äúmansion‚Äù his family paid for. She actually hasn‚Äôt even used her social media in months!

And my husband and I have now realized how small and insignificant her believers were... some who we thought were our friends. This adversity made us work harder and made our relationship so much more solid. We‚Äôre now happier than ever and moving onto better careers and opportunities in a new city, leaving behind the community she fought so hard to ‚Äúwin‚Äù over.

That was long. Sorry! I only tell you this because it takes patience and strength, but just completely ignore your narc and his flying monkeys. Because eventually, everyone will see the truth, and all the narc will have is their own distorted sense of self obsession to keep them warm at night."
