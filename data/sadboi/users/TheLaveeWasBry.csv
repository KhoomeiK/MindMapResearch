I say that because I believe this project would really be better suited as an answer to an interview question, either in person or on the phone. The reason for this is that the details of this project are probably going to go way over the head of the employer looking to hire someone. What they want to hear is that you have the aptitude to get into the nitty gritty details for a project you're passionate about, not about exactly how you did it. Save the paper space for something where the details are what you're relying on, rather than the general idea. 

My first engineering job, I believe I got mostly because of my hobby project I told them about during the phone interview. It was a project my roommate and i got into during our senior year (both electrical engineers) where we made a door sensor that played the bass theme of Seinfeld anytime someone entered the room with an Arduino and a kids toy with a speaker. 

My resume situation was mostly listing experience from a bunch of past part-time jobs I had. I don't think I would've felt comfortable at the time putting a project like that on my resume, but I'd definitely say a hobby project like a web shooter could make a resume stand put more. I just think it's better suited as an answer for an interview question like ""describe this gap in employment"". Hope that helps and keep on tinkering!"

Damn this one really got me. Years into my adulthood, my footsteps have always been eerily quiet. It's to the point where I feel like I need a cat bell or something so I don't scare my coworkers at their desk when I come up to ask them something, since they never hear me coming. And I'm a big dude too, lol (26/M/235 lbs) but I still walk around out of habit like I can't let anyone hear me, like I'm still walking on eggshells around my house growing up. I still hate letting doors slam behind me, so I'll catch it just before it closes. 

I often felt like my Nmom would flip out at any proof of my existence I left behind because I didn't do EXACTLY as instructed, and it only got worse after I had to move back home after college. Every dish had to be washed, dried, and put away immediately after use.  Laundry machines had to be emptied immediately after each cycle finished because she was so used to monopolizing laundry for the house.

Thankfully Iâ€™m in my own place now and established a little-to-no contact relationship with Nmom. But I still catch myself doing things I can only attribute to FLEAS because literally nothing else can explain them."

narcissisticparents,fdk9cm5,t1_fdk2rad,1578499022.0,"Yeah I relate to this so much. I grew up with a much closer bond with my dad, especially with having divorced parents, and my Nmom has always resented me for it. It's been 2 years since he's passed and I feel like it's been impossible to counteract the skewed reality that sets in whenever I have to deal with her shit."
