CliqueSupport,f5raklf,t3_dok6um,1572391034.0,"To me it felt like floating along a river. Being carried along by everyone around me. But eventually the river leads to the sea, where you must fight for the direction you want. It‚Äôa hard to move on your own. People won‚Äôt always be there, so you have to believe you are a special being. Only you can save yourself.
