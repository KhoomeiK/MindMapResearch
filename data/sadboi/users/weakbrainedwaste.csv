MensLib,floeu0a,t1_flodqex,1585336935.0,"I think it’s a combination of the two. If you were raised with that right-wing idea of sex is bad and sexual thoughts are inherently dirty, you’d be more prone to internally mixing up any critiques about sex with that mindset. Now I’m definitely not saying it’s bad to call out toxic masculine behaviors. I’m just saying prior negative ideas about sex can lead to drawing wrong conclusions from these call-outs."
MensLib,flod6t7,t1_flochpl,1585336027.0,"But the problem is that men often are ashamed of feelings or behaviors that aren’t toxic. Like fantasizing about sex or talking about sex with friends. Casting the net too wide for toxic behaviors is damaging to male sexuality, and is probably the source for a lot of the pushback against it."
MensLib,flo8yns,t3_fpt4gp,1585333795.0,"There are few positive portrayals in culture of men discussing sex and sexuality, while nearly every portrayal of women discussing it is favorable. This leads to men viewing their own sexuality as perverted, which is a big blow to self esteem."
MensLib,flo812i,t1_flo4gnn,1585333305.0,"I think both the negative predatory forms and positive predatory forms exist alongside one another. And it’s especially negative for a male who doesn’t want sex to be predatory, and so feels ashamed for sexual thoughts and desires. This is true even if it was solely viewed in a ‘positive’ predatory light."
mensa,fll0tad,t3_fpgp2a,1585251491.0,"When people assume the more intelligent person is obviously the correct one. And when people completely disregard moral arguments in favor of logical ones. Ted Bundy’s IQ was in the 130s and Ted Kaczynski’s was in the 160s, but that doesn’t make them correct at all. People tend to assume morals are always backseat to logic, and that just isn’t true. Sure, there are many times when logic is the main topic being argued over, but most debates have a human aspect to them, too. The “I’m smart therefore right” argument is one of the biggest things that pisses me off. 

Also a second one would be people over-inflating their vocabulary in order to seem more intelligent. I don’t want to be policing anyone’s language, but it’s obvious when someone’s trying too hard, and it really gets under my skin. I mean I get it that sometimes some people’s brains default to fancier word choices, I do that sometimes, too. But when you’re making a Reddit argument with language that would be suitable for a doctorate thesis, that really shows you’re stuck up, and stuck up people really piss me off."

askteenboys,flc6rks,t3_fnx473,1585021381.0,"Starting from a 5 as average 

+3 for no periods (I’ve heard about them from my female friends and Jesus Christ they seem like they suck)

-3 for stricter gender roles (have you ever seen a straight Tom-girl?)

+4 for generally being treated as more competent, and less discrimination and sexual harassment (not completely absent though, I’ve been sexually harassed before)

+1 for more strength (I’m a weak mfer and I’m still stronger than a vast majority of girls

-2 for a harder time dating

-0.5 for being lumped in with all the rapists (Doesn’t happen often, but I’ll often come across that sentiment, and it can sometimes make me feel shitty about being male)

-2 because I don’t get along with guys as well as girls, but I generally feel like an outsider in girl friend groups. I also mostly hang with girls so people think I’m gay a lot. This ties in with the stricter gender roles

 I’m probably missing some stuff, but based off of this I’ll give being male a 5.5/10"

aspergers,fk36f2i,t1_fk33179,1583819407.0,"Our pronouns for gender are social constructs, as are our ideas that different genders wear different clothing. If you are born male but you want to be called female pronouns, wear female clothes and makeup, and look like a female, that’s expressing yourself through societal constructs. Doing all these things can be shortened to changing your gender, which is done through by way of abstract constructs. Thus, gender is a social construct. Trans people aren’t denying that they were born with the genitalia they were born with. They’re just expressing themselves through pronouns, dress, and mannerisms that align with societal standards of the opposite gender."
aspergers,fk36271,t3_fg6qvb,1583819026.0,"I identify so much with this

I’m male, but I’ve always had more female friends than male ones. I don’t have a single male friend right now, but I have four female ones. I’ve never thought of myself as much of a masculine person, although I wouldn’t say I’m much of a feminine one either. But sometimes I feel like I look too manly (I’m 16 and literally 120 pounds so I don’t look manly at all, but I still feel like it’s too much). Like I don’t know what I’m supposed to look like, but it’s not what I see in the mirror. I don’t feel like I should look any more feminine, and I know for a fact I’m not nonbinary. In a way I feel like I look too old for how I feel. I dunno though.

And in behavior I’m more reserved and not a risk taker. I don’t like being aggressive, and I hate doing anything remotely dangerous (because I’m worried I’ll mess it up). I don’t do anything even remotely ‘feminine’ though, because I have a huge fear of standing out, and I can’t handle any possible situation where I might be labeled as weird. Like I couldn’t go into a women’s hair salon, I’d die of anxiety. That being said, I don’t do many masculine activities either. Most of the activities I do are neutral."

One time I was just sitting in my room and I just randomly decided to drink bleach right then. No plan beforehand or anything. So I walked downstairs and by the time I got to the bleach I just kind of stood there. By that time I’d come to my senses enough that I realized it was stupid to kill myself on a whim, and any big life choices (haha get it) require a lot more planning. So I decided not to right then and I went back upstairs. But it was weird, I don’t remember exactly why I decided split second, but it was probably something tiny like the WiFi going out or spilling a bit of soda outside the cup when I poured it.
