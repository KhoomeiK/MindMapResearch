depression,fqwz6li,t3_glevua,1589721841.0,"I don't know , chronic crippling depression to the point where u can't do anything, can't do any simple tasks , at least it's very hard to do or initiate them is something horribly tough to break. for me sometimes it's like trying to move in slow motion, no energy, desire, nothing

idk the answer, I especially don't know the answer because I been
In this hole for a long time but I don't think anyone has a clear perfect answer that works for everyone as everyone's situation is different & r affected diff & think diff

At the core I think it comes down to ourselves to somehow... figure it out 
Ofc assistance from others can help but it comes down to how we interpret/use the help we get 

 i really don't know, sometimes I have faith, sometimes I don't, sometimes I find energy to do something for a while then I fall off course. Sometimes I feel like I find peace then it's lost. It's a struggle... A tug of war idk
time helps, sometimes it makes it worse.

It can be like walking blindfolded through the woods looking for a pot of gold that will put back on track.
Or more like crawling or doing nothing at all.. laying on the grass waiting for the gold to be handed to u ..

The mind block/paralysis of depression is a real thing

I think we have to hold onto a sliver of hope even if it's very thin.. or trick ourselves into believing that there's hope to hold even it doesn't feel like it... at all

..and cling & hold on to that hope for ""dear"" life"
depression,fqwwgop,t3_glefhd,1589719695.0,"I'm not trying to make this about religion but...

This is the unintentional or absent minded narcissism that tends to spew from religious people. Thinking ""God blessed me, he blessed me with this & that"" while millions of other people are given bad cards. As if they're disproportionately more pure, worthy and meek that their God would bless & favor them over others in dire situations.

I'm sure she was just happy and didn't have any negative intent with her post and didn't realize it could come across as insensitive.

But then again this is social media, a lot of ppl do this"

It must be hard. This has become a global epidemic and people are losing jobs and their sanity and it has caused hatred, fear, anxiety, xenophobia against the Chinese. This is a type of racism that will be very hard to break and remove from the minds of these people over the next coming years. Do what you feel is right but don't exhaust yourself especially in these early stages of this world-wide pandemic as most of these people publicly portraying racism will likely not care as they will be connecting their financial losses, depression, anxiety, and possible infection or the death of their loved ones to the Chinese."

Anxiety,fkdr79d,t3_fhwp6f,1584091345.0,"i started doing the same thing, just not talking to certain people that I know i'm just going to be fake with them. i'm tired of replying to people hitting me up saying ""How are you"" when i know i truly wont say how i'm feeling because I don't want to unpack what i've been going through to them especially if i deem that they likely will not care, show concern, or even reply or say anything of worth to me besides cliche nonsense. current with my chronic depression and psychosis i had in 2019 made me end up in the hospital for a month, i realize there's still an element of judgement that comes with people that know what happened, belittling what im going through, thinking im just not strong enough, and dictating for me what they think i should be doing just because I dropped everything i was working on due to my psychosis. i realize i dont need to tolerate judgment or tell everybody what im going through as not everybody truly cares. i realize that i need to be careful with who i share my ""energy"" with, i rather tell people who i deem as close friends where I feel comfortable to tell them the full picture and not be fake, where i can let my skeletons out of the closet without feeling judged. there's times where i would tell some people too much information of what i was going through because I just didn't care what people thought and i ended up just not seeing the reciprocation or being ghosted as they just didnt want to listen to my problems. I've also come to really acknowledge how ultimately no one can save you but yourself and that you should become your own backbone and to not rely on people."

scarlxrd,fj4fgwj,t1_fj3vhsj,1583007037.0,"at face value it sounds like that's all scarlxrds talking about in this song but I'm sure he's at the same time talking about ""terrafxrming"" himself as he opens up by saying ""get out of my mind.... You Tyrant"" and in the bridge* saying ""I've tried before, it's like I'm lost inside my head.""  It's a constant theme in his music where he metaphorically talks about ""murdering"" himself or ""killing himself"" to become a new version of himself. And in this song he's likely using the concept of terrafxrming metaphorically to convey a deeper message.

If he was flat out just talking about terrafxrming it would kinda bland & it wouldn't make much sense when he mentions his mind or being lost in his own head"
