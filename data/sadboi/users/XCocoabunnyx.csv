As long as your references are all genuine and they‚Äôre not generic and thereby look the same I imagine there should be no problem.

Good afternoon,


Hello professor X, I wanted to discuss the previous assignment we just had. As per your instructions I copied and pasted my essay into the text box but I now realize it only submitted a sentence. Below I have attached my full essay. Feel free to review it when you get a chance. I appreciate your time.

Thank you,

(Your name)"
college,f93i6id,t3_e38kzx,1575059672.0,I‚Äôm a average student and I have a scholarship that pays out each semester. It really helps to apply for scholarships that are local in my case. Online scholarships have millions of people applying to them which makes them look at only the best of the best. Call me crazy but a gpa of 3.9 is great? Most scholarships prefer 3.5 or better. Try to ask people that worked in your previous high school if they know of any scholarships. Applying for scholarships can get really discouraging but just keep trying and you will define find one. If I can get a big scholarship with a 3.2 you most definitely have a great change of doing the same. You can do it!
college,f93h9o9,t3_e3ip17,1575059018.0,"It really depends on the people you know and attract. The people that I attract are not partiers and don‚Äôt drink so I never experienced the partying scene despite being a junior in college. However, the school throws nice campus events everyday so I try to be apart of those. For me college is a bit bland but refreshing. College is like water for me. Similar to water it is bland but I know I need it. Also my campus is dry meaning no alcohol is allowed on any premise. If you want a party kind of school then go to a big school. My advice is don‚Äôt worry about that as you can get so many amazing experiences in college."
college,f93gcja,t3_e3hd9k,1575058345.0,"I really like study groups. Since I‚Äôm the one that typically gets the group together I tend to make a list so everyone know the things we‚Äôll go over in the session. Sometimes I make Flashcards so we can quiz each other which is really fun. When a study group is not as structured me and the other group members just scroll through our notes and bring up topics we are confused by as they come. This method allows us to improve our notes by adding any extra piece of information. In my experience smaller study groups are more effective when it‚Äôs four people or less. It also helps when the study group is for a major class because it will be a bigger priority. Lastly, it helps to study with likeminded people. If you value studying but the other people just want to cram that group may not help you as much."
SuicideWatch,f8rjvhp,t1_f8rjq0m,1574742430.0,Of course! I know it sucks when your therapist is not that good but I'm sure if you keep looking than you will find one that fits you.
SuicideWatch,f8rj59g,t3_e1rufw,1574741829.0,"Theres something ironic about overdosing on antidepressants. The one thing that we try to turn to, to improve our lives may just be the thing that harms us. Please do not go through with this! From what I know antidepressants take a while to show improvements. With those you feel a little more down before it begins to work. Perhaps wait a couple of days and try to take the recommended dose. Keep fighting, you can do this. This is not the best solution but sometimes taking a day off and just resting can help. It won't help drastically but perhaps you can try it out."
SuicideWatch,f8rif6m,t3_e1je3b,1574741256.0,What stops me from leaving is my mother. My mother doesn't have a good relationship with the rest of our family because  no one is close to one another. I'm all she has so if I leave she will be lonely. Sometimes I'm happy I have her to anchor me to life but I'm not sure what will happen  if that changes.
SuicideWatch,f8rho39,t3_e1h7fk,1574740670.0,"While it sounds a bit morbid, I do agree with you. There's something about knowing you can end your suffering quickly that makes it feel comforting. Sometimes I would think that if things do not go as planned at least there is still a plan b I can rely on. It almost makes me feel like I have more control/input in my life."

college,f8n8dv7,t3_e1340a,1574640360.0,"I would recommend the 3 hour school if you are dorming. This will allow you to not feel like you are as restricted under your parents and you'll feel more free. Im sure that you will miss your old friends but if the friendships are meant to be this will not change that. A college that is further away will propel you to meet new people instead of being dependent on the people you already know. Also, sometimes it get tiring seeing the same people everyday in your neighborhood and college allows you to see more variety.

Professors,f8klo2f,t1_f8hd52f,1574612430.0,"Great points! I happen to find your last point especially interesting. Let‚Äôs use this example, imagine you want to buy a fridge. You might decide to look online for others reviews of said fridge. If a certain fridge tends to get very negative reviews that would hinder people from buying it. I would hope that if the company noticed they would stop selling that fridge model... that doesn‚Äôt really apply to professors (even without tenure). The main issue with rmp is that it tends to favor easy A classes while discouraging people from challenging courses. Thankfully I have found a number of great reviews on challenging professors. I also find students that got Cs in the class that will still recommend the professor because the professor was good. I take it with a grain of salt, I don‚Äôt expect any professors to be perfect. And if the negative reviews are fake I get to save myself from taking a class with someone who would feel the need to fake his or her reviews."
Professors,f8gy9vr,t1_f8gmzd4,1574566874.0,"The syllabus is given on the first day, while great it does not give me an adequate amount of notice. The syllabus for that class was not entirely detailed for projects. With rmp I can know these kinds of details months in advance. You bring up a very great point but as a student that loves to lurk on this subreddit, I recall a professor being annoyed that a student ask for a syllabus not to long ago. Despite this, going forward I will make an effort to email professors regarding class projects. Thanks for the suggestion! And to address your last sentence I can neither agree nor disagree entirely. I think a professor would be more interested in just giving me details from their syllabus instead of telling me the experiences of the students whereas rmp will. Also, I like asking other students about what classes and professors they enjoyed. I believe students use a little bit of everything when deciding what courses to take. These factors may include: time, class size, ratemyprofessor.com, experiences of their peers etc. Either way I would love to hear more of your thoughts on rmp."
Professors,f8fusw7,t1_f8fsk36,1574549678.0,"To give you some more background I‚Äôll give you an example of this. I took a gender studies class which was absolutely phenomenal, however, one thing the reviews failed to mention is that at the end of this course I would have to do a vagina monologue kind of performance. This fact was told well into the class which gave me a horrible anxiety attack that clouded that last month of the course for me. If I was able to read a review that told me this I would‚Äôve been able to mentally prepare myself I would‚Äôve kept the course but I would‚Äôve been able to land on a better feet mentally. At this point in my life I don‚Äôt mind giving presentations, it doesn‚Äôt scare me in the least but last semester it did. I got an A in the class and I still love the class but that‚Äôs just a little example and I hope it helps you see things from my perspective a bit better."
Professors,f8fsl0z,t1_f8frn8o,1574548781.0,That‚Äôs amazing! It makes me want to ask my schools student government to do the same. At least this way students and faculty can be assured that the reviews can‚Äôt be tampered with and are honest.
Professors,f8fqugp,t1_f8f6s46,1574548143.0,Professors that are more average (Neither terrible nor amazing) tend to not spark enough energy that will lead to a student rating them. If anything it‚Äôs actually a good sign that you are well received by your students.
Professors,f8fq2ij,t3_e0ln9n,1574547873.0,"Prepare to downvote this post.

As a student, I happened to value rmp. It allows me to mentally prepare myself for the class which helps my anxiety. I can‚Äôt speak on behalf of other universities but at mine we cannot see a professors evaluations, in fact I didn‚Äôt know any schools could. I don‚Äôt mind if a class has a lot of work. I‚Äôm more interested if the professor responds to emails, has an accent, if the class requires expensive books, extra credit, along with any big projects to expect. I believe the reason that it‚Äôs hard to take rmp as seriously is because professors are trying to change their reviews so it aligns with how they feel about themselves. A student will always have a different view of a professor than their colleagues which allows other students to relate to rmp reviews. It would be amazing if universities had their own public rating system that only students at the particular school could contribute to."
college,f841fmp,t1_f83zdmn,1574227300.0,"I completely understand, I appreciate that! Thankfully l all the jobs I had relates to my degree because that is definitely important.
