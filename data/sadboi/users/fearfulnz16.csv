AskReddit,ffdryvh,t3_esse9d,1579827457.0,"I was on a trip to Massachusetts and met this maybe 16 year old kid (I was about 12 at the time) on a bus at like 3am. 

I sat behind him, and he turned around, smiled, and just said, “the WiFi actually works on his bus,” 

I replied awkwardly with, “oh, thank god,” he turned around and didn’t say anything until hours later when we were in New York when we got off the bus, then immediately got back on. (Our bus tickets got messed it, but that’s a whole other story) 

I can’t remember what he said, but it was something along the lines of, “hello again,” 

I’m not sure where this guy is, but I love him.

Edit: I actually don’t even know why I remember him, maybe it was because he was friendly."
