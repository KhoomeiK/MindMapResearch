MacMiller,fenhmwf,t3_eq2scx,1579284882.0,It’s one of my favourites as well. Also a song that feels most complete to me.
MacMiller,fenhfob,t3_eq3wi7,1579284758.0,"“I’m busy trippin’ bout some shit that still ain’t even happen yet” 
“Inside my head is pretty cluttered, I try, but can’t clean up this mess I made” 
😭 miss him"
MacMiller,femrodh,t3_eq08wu,1579267662.0,"Blue world, Woods, Hands and Circles are my favourites so far. Album grows on me every time I listen 😌"
MacMiller,felbwxt,t1_fel39rc,1579218565.0,"Well according to my dream, it’s my favourite off the album so I’m excited to hear it lol."
MacMiller,felbvqf,t1_feksu8v,1579218544.0,It was really fun. I can’t wait to hear it now!
Anxiety,f6qr8e1,t3_dso52h,1573083883.0,"Hey, I had my first ever job interview last year and I was nervous as fuck and genuinely thought I couldn’t do it. I pushed through my anxiety and went to it anyway and it was completely fine and all the little things I worried about didn’t happen! Good luck 🖤"
depression,f6jpr2l,t3_drkkj5,1572898366.0,Good for you! Hope it continues :))
braces,f5z35jc,t3_dpr2pp,1572566084.0,"Palette expander was hands down the worst part of my braces experience, couldn’t wait to get that fucker off."
braces,f5u1wbx,t1_f5rs584,1572467354.0,"Hey, I just got them off and it was totally fine lol. I don’t even know why I was so nervous but that’s normal I guess. Thanks for your comment💚"
braces,f5120uw,t3_dmhwch,1571936126.0,"Wow they look so much better already, they’re gonna look amazing when they come off! 💜"

depression,f49v54s,t3_djze4l,1571484530.0,"Hey I’m so glad you didn’t do it! Animals are really amazing, I love my cats so much and spending time with them is like therapy to me. Hope you feel better soon 🧡"

soccer,f47y6s2,t1_f44g43g,1571429733.0,Weird we never made an offer but were so heavily linked with him. Maybe it was a lie pulled by Sporting to get Spurs to cough up the money?
soccer,f44frdp,t3_djdfyb,1571351736.0,"His non-transfer saga was so weird. United and Tottenham linked with him every week for like 3 months, journalists saying deals were done and he’s nearly a United/Spurs player, him crying in his supposed to be last game, and then just nothing happened. What the fuck?"
AskReddit,f2zssij,t1_f2zr7f7,1570537352.0,"Holy shit, I just read up on this guy. What a mess he is."
AskReddit,f2zqfth,t1_f2zqe28,1570535013.0,What? I thought he was just a drug addict?
braces,f2zp2nz,t3_dex4wt,1570533492.0,"My biggest fear when I get my braces off (in about 2 weeks) is my teeth going back to how they were, so I can’t believe how many people stop wearing them 😭. Hope your teeth feel better soon tho!"
Anxiety,f2zojna,t1_f2zd3ne,1570532866.0,"Yeah I’m the same tbh. My mum went out to a shopping mall on a Saturday night and I thought a terror attack was going to happen. I think it’s possible these things can happen, but also we can’t let them stop us from living our lives."
Anxiety,f2xu7zi,t1_f2uugmh,1570482582.0,"I think some anxiety can be real. You know actual dangerous and unsafe things. But for me, 99% of my anxiety is worrying about things that don’t even happen."
Anxiety,f2xu0ct,t1_f2voao3,1570482512.0,I like that! And it’s so true. Will remember that one 💜
Anxiety,f2xtudt,t1_f2uv2ta,1570482455.0,Congrats! Glad you ignored it 💜
Anxiety,f2xtr2g,t1_f2u9wxg,1570482424.0,It will! Hope your foot is better soon 💜
Anxiety,f2xtp0p,t1_f2tdtxy,1570482404.0,It is. It’s lying because it doesn’t want us to better ourselves and progress. You can do this 💜
Anxiety,f2xtkhs,t1_f2t9hpe,1570482362.0,"Hey, thanks! Hope things get better for you 💜"
MacMiller,f2xe46u,t3_dely70,1570477233.0,That is amazing wow
depression,f2jpzi9,t3_ddh0xv,1570276038.0,"I go to the gym to help with my depression. It helps because it’s getting my out the house, I’m socialising and exercising, it’s like a 3-in-1 lol. I think it’s  underrated how much exercise can actually help when you feel depressed. If I don’t go to the gym, I notice my mood is so bad and I feel shitty through out the day."
depression,f23oxjw,t3_dbqf05,1569933497.0,"Hey, I think your first step should be telling your parents about school. I quit going college because it made me so depressed and filled me with anxiety and I lied about to my dad for a good 2 years and it was horrible. Everyday you lie about it, it just builds up and makes it even worse. I’m sure your parents are caring and want the best for you. Hope it goes well and you feel better soon ❤️"
depression,f1lctp1,t1_f1lbph6,1569551396.0,"Yeah if you’ve texted her saying you’re worried and she still hasn’t replied, the next best thing would be going to her house :)"
depression,f1l9094,t3_d9tan5,1569548600.0,"You should text her saying just want to make sure you're ok (if you haven’t already). If you have, I’d go to her house, it shows you really care. I think I’d want that if I was feeling bad. Hope she’s ok :)"
depression,f1l8nwa,t3_d9te6t,1569548355.0,"Hey I’m glad you want to live. I feel the same way, I want to live I just don’t feel like I’m fulfilling it with happiness and good memories. But anyway at least we want to live 😊"
MacMiller,f1hrg8b,t3_d9bh4e,1569499554.0,One of my favourite songs ever 😌
depression,f19ys4q,t1_ezslhwh,1569281407.0,"Hey, sorry I’ve only just seen this comment. I really hope you’re feeling better and if you’re not, let me know ❤️"

depression,f19er5p,t3_d88q9p,1569271503.0,"Holy shit are you me? I’m 20 and I’ve never had a job but it’s at that point where I seriously need one now because I can’t go to my parents for money. I also quit college because my mental health was awful. I’ve been feeling a lot better recently and I can’t really pinpoint what’s got me feeling better, maybe it’s been exercise but who knows. Anyway, I hope you feel better soon and no matter how shitty everything may seem, I promise you things will get better and you will feel better. Take care ❤️"
MacMiller,ezw0auw,t3_d2kpkg,1568204127.0,Happy for you 💜
depression,ezw04pc,t3_d2p4pz,1568203967.0,"Hey, I did that last year after not doing it for 3 years and I felt like shit after. I’m here if you need to talk to someone :))"

MacMiller,ezkn0mt,t1_ezkjs3c,1567963106.0,Hey could you message it me please :))
MacMiller,ezjct7k,t1_ezhs069,1567942558.0,"It really does. So relatable and honest, love him for that."
MacMiller,ezjcqub,t1_ezhskez,1567942531.0,Hey I’m glad. Sending you love back ❤️
MacMiller,ezjcpjf,t1_ezgzynj,1567942510.0,So true. I found it really brave of him to speak so openly about his drug addiction and how he thought they would kill him eventually. I’m very sad they actually did and he couldn’t get help. Addiction truly is a disease.
MacMiller,ezgrj9h,t3_d13mei,1567900546.0,I walked my dog and listened to swimming. It was therapeutic as fuck.
MacMiller,ezgqoer,t1_ezgnh2h,1567900222.0,"Shit sucks doesn’t it? To make myself feel better, I just think he’s in a better place and I’m forever grateful I was alive the same time as him and discovered his music."
MacMiller,ezglrf7,t3_d0z8rw,1567898385.0,"Don’t think I’ll ever be over his death. For someone so young and talented, it’s just not fair. I think about him everyday."
braces,ez0vay4,t3_czrruh,1567642413.0,Wow I feel this. I had this appliance and two of my molars removed. Nearing the end of my braces experience and can honestly say every bit of pain has been worth it. You got this ❤️❤️❤️

AskReddit,eyucbyk,t3_cyuyee,1567458406.0,Travis Scott. Can’t get onboard with any of his songs.
depression,eytrkin,t1_eymxxqc,1567443939.0,Yeah I’m sure she’d like to hear it. I know I would 😌

depression,eym88xb,t3_cxnela,1567201990.0,"Sooooo true. My neighbour is one of my only best friends from growing up and we hardly ever see each other but when she comes round, I feel so much better about everything. Talking with her makes me feel motivated and better about life, I don’t think she realises the affect it has on me."

depression,esq9gbb,t3_c8v5ar,1562198109.0,"I think it’s so difficult to find beauty/happiness/hope/etc. when you feel so shitty all the time, so I can relate. However, sometimes I have moments when I’m like holy shit life is worth living and I want to live every moment of it. Those moments are very rare but they stop me from killing myself."
depression,esq9701,t3_c8v8dt,1562197965.0,"Hey, you should definitely not kill yourself. I know you have no energy, but reaching out to people and asking for help will help you feel better 🧡"
depression,esq92fy,t3_c8vcke,1562197900.0,I can relate. I’ve been feeling this way for about 3 years and nothing has changed and it’s so shitty watching people around you grow up and evolve.
depression,esq8dsl,t3_c8vclv,1562197516.0,Please don’t do this and reach out for help. I’m here to talk if you need it 🧡
