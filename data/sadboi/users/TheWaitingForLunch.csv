I guess my biggest concern is that most people I've talked to have almost a mob-mentality, kill-the-witch-dog feel about them. And they don't discriminate between pure bred dogs and mutts/mixes.

People who want to fight pit bulls and breed them are going to not only breed for better fighting dogs, but also treat them in a way that makes them more aggressive. Otherwise, they'd be undoing all their efforts. And many people who want a family-friendly dog end up getting a mixed breed. It would be interesting to see the results of a study on that. 

It's also interesting that the pit bull used to be an American mascot. You can find old art of the dogs portrayed in ways that look nothing but friendly to me in a quick Google search. I'd wonder where the switch came from - was it truly from pure bred pit bulls, or was it from abused pure bred pit bulls?"

My guess (totally not an expert) is that it's something like serial killing in humans - you need the genetic predisposition, the environment, and the stressor/trigger of some sort. Without all three, no problems. But I'd wager that even a ""good breed"" could fall into the violent category (see: probably Chihuahuas) given the right (wrong?) circumstances. 

One thing most people forget - golden retrievers and pit bulls and Rottweilers and bichon frises ARE ALL THE SAME SPECIES. Like, the French and Russians and Iranians and Ghanians and and Americans are all humans. Maybe one family line has had to experience more violence than another or have committed more violence than others, but people have proven that that doesn't mean all descendants will be violent (source: am nonviolent descendant of Vikings.

Yes, we can see their point. And yes, all these sympathy subs get circle-jerky.

Boomer as a word, not as the new usage, literally refers to the entire generation and has for years. Absolutely every person. Confusion is natural and it's silly of us to think it shouldn't be. The other part is that people use it too often, and in the wrong contexts. A phrase like ok boomer is really best used ""wake up"" somebody in the moment. People are using it instead whenever they're angry.

A good parallel is this: I have strong opinions on how a lot of bikers drive. I joke, ""Yes, we really do need to watch out for motorcycles on the road! The good drivers, since they don't deserve to die, and the bad drivers, since they're trying to land me in jail!"" I'm obviously not talking about all bikers, and I state that clearly.

insanepeoplefacebook,fb2irgo,t1_fb1xuox,1576451806.0,"I have to say, as much as I hate what many baby boomers have done to the world, I really think all of this boils down to the truth that all people are stupid. There are levels, of course. There are the idiots who ignored climate change data for years and years and racists and misogynists etc. Then there are the people who had grown up around this mindset, and decided they were adults and knew all they needed to know. Then there are the people who lived around both of these who only knew as much as was shown to them and had to work hard to keep us younger folk fed and clothed, and didn't have a lot of mental energy for self-betterment. Those ones are just as dumb as we are, and maybe no worse. Then there are the ones who've actually been trying to fix things and couldn't, because the people and the time weren't right. 

It's almost inevitable that we're currently screwing over the next generation, because we can only see so far and we can only convince other people to grow so fast. Knowledge is cumulative and evolving. We're almost inevitably going to face this same kind of criticism. We might even deserve it. 

Lastly, I really don't think it's ever fair or effective to say to someone that they don't feel hurt (we have no control of that), that they should know what we mean (if they didn't see how they were screwing us over, how are they supposed to know), or that they should essentially shed their identity, because they were one of the GOOD ones. 

I've dealt with an older relative who unknowingly gave me a lot of trouble dealing with things. However, this relative also put me through school, fed and clothed me. She was just dumb and didn't know how to raise a kid before she had a crack at it. There are SO many boomers like that. Yes, they're adults and should be able to be strong and take the lead. But I think we should all be able to see, the more we come into adulthood, that adults are just grown up children, and being strong and changing yourself to care for others sometimes actually feels almost like pain. For the average Joe who truly didn't know any better, education and help might actually be more effective than shouting ""ok boomer"" at them, when they're just trying to pay the bills. 

Also, reference The Boy Who Cried Wolf. Not an exact parallel, but the more often we use something that doesn't exactly apply or in an ineffective way, the less people take us seriously. Not really what we want.

TLDR: we're all dumb, we're all people, other people are allowed to have feelings and if we actually want to be better, WE have to be what we wish the older generation was. Ok boomer is WAYYYYYYY overused."

Anxiety,faao9cj,t3_e7zecu,1575911409.0,"Looks like you've gotten to one of the less fun landmarks of growing up and becoming a self-sufficient human - realizing your parents are actually terrible at certain important life skills!  Part of it is a generational thing. There are 100% people in their age group with anxiety, probably a lot, but there was even more of a stigma about getting help when they were growing up. This is one of the things that informs their approach to your problem. Unfortunately, when you've gotten to this stage in your relationship with your parents, you sometimes end up parenting THEM. You may have to teach them how to care for you. 

I think one of the problems they're having is that they're splitting hairs - people who are shy DO have social anxiety. It's pretty much another way to describe the same thing, if a less severe form?

They may be trying to help you by ""normalizing"" your feelings - ""don't worry, you're not broken"" sort of deal. Soooooo close to helpful XD 

As much as it sucks, the best way I've found to work with someone on something like this is to treat it like a project at school or something - do research, literally put together resources for them to look at, and make a convincing argument. The second most important part is to do most of what you need for your care yourself. Set everything up in a way that doesn't inconvenience anyone too much, and present it to them. If you're clever and they're not jerks, they'll have no reason at all to say no. Not always worth the trouble, but if you're stuck living with and being related to them, it might be in your best interests. 

I'm sorry you're going through this. You have more power than you know, both in life and in this situation. Sounds like the CBT book people are recommending should be helpful, too

Even the person you originally replied to was angry and unsympathetic to OP, probably from the second they saw ""boomer.""

Having grown up in an older family (grandparents helping raise me, etc.), I've begun to wonder if this approach helps, though. Yes, the baby boomers are still in charge of most things, so it's not like the younger generations could just start changing things to improve the situation. And yes, just sitting back and saying nothing won't solve anything. And yes, they're often wrong about how to deal with the world/society's problems/etc. But I think we're relying too heavily on the ""okay boomer"" approach. It's got shock value, yes, and might get them to listen for a beat or two. It's insulting, yes, and might get them to think twice about whether everyone's really happy with them or not. But that's all it has. It's a quick, insulting rebuttal that belongs in an argument in real time to wake someone up. I think we end up using it to stew in our anger instead of educating people like those you replied to. 

Whether educating works or not largely depends on the mood someone's in. So, if we tell someone they don't have basic reading comprehension, they're definitely not going to listen. It's satisfying in the short run, but I doubt they'd hear a single word you say afterwards, even though you obviously have a lot of insight.

Aside from that, the original post was comparing apples and oranges. A man coming in with a problem in his pants would be more like wearing a clingy shirt with no bra, not like lipstick. Red lipstick is like a guy wearing a fancy belt to draw attention down. Not the same as a boner."

It's the only tea tree product line that hasn't irritated mine, and the essence worked really well at reducing my acne. I think the essence says it's good for use on your scalp, too. Not an oily product. (Ba dum ch!)"

Anxiety,etzzij7,t1_etut9y6,1563339393.0,"I've been in situations like that, too. I felt like my whole world was ending. It's a really weird feeling looking back on those days, because now I can see both my memories and feelings of powerlessness and also the reality of how much freedom I had. I had to give up on a lot of things that were important to me. In retrospect, those things were toxic, but it was truly awful at the time. After a few years, though, I started to feel better than I ever had before. 

I'm 100% NOT trying to imply that your relationship is something you'll have to give up, FYI, especially if it's important to you. I am saying that I can guarantee that there'll always be an end to crappy things and major relief afterwards, even if it's just for a little while. Winston Churchill's quote is my favorite: ""If you're going through hell, keep going."" Don't stay where it sucks to be! There's always a solution other than sacrificing your mental and emotional health. Breathe, do something small that fortifies you when you have the chance. We're rooting for you."
Anxiety,etu08lm,t1_ettpws0,1563200988.0,"I think OP means that your best is good enough to keep going. I know you can show up even though you know things are going to be terrible, because I've done it. I know you can look for employment over and over and keep finding new jobs because I've done that, too. A lot of my anxiety was based on a very narrow view of success and security. The world is a wide place and there's a lot of security to be had in flexibility, too. Another thing that's helped me: no one ever starts off as good at something. Most people don't become good at something for a while, even. If you aren't doing well at something and you don't know what to do, the first steps are to seek instruction/constructive feedback from the people who are in charge (sometimes they're shitty teachers and won't bother to tell you themselves) and make a change in your strategy. Any change at all. Eventually, you'll happen on the right one and you'll start to get what you weren't getting. You're steering your ship, not your boss or the evaluating committee. They don't want the job of making you a better person, and they'd suck at doing it anyway. They don't deserve the respect you're giving them, allowing them to be more righteous in judging your self worth than you are or the people who know and care about you. Protect your sense of worthiness in yourself from their inaccurate and incomplete opinions, because if you can't believe in your own agency, you'll never improve. That's where anxiety hits us the hardest. The real thing it should say on your evaluation is that you need to find that feeling of efficacy. Sometimes, people in positions of power are ignorant and inept. They almost always are when it comes to anxiety/depression/etc., unless they've been through it themselves. They aren't being paid to be therapists, and they wouldn't do it if they were asked, because they can't. They're no good at it. They're just as stupid and incompetent as we are. My biggest rule for myself these days: if feedback doesn't help me get better, it's worthless and I shouldn't give it the time of day. I can find my own way better because I know myself better. You can and should steer your own ship. <3 You're much more powerful than you know. 

On a more concrete note, looking for a better job situation while working doesn't count as quitting."

Conservative,eraramf,t1_eracmk1,1560651016.0,"The logic of all these things makes sense to me. Where I begin to question this sort of thinking is the point where people say that because gun violence, especially the mass shootings, is statistically rare, we don't need any further regulation. We do research to battle disease with little complaint (except from anti vaxxers and religious extremists, I guess), but if we talk about regulating, not banning, other things that can harm people, conversations become arguments. I'm not savvy with the exact wording of proposed gun control laws. I'm sure people who are hurt by tragedies demand more than what is actually necessary. But isn't there room to explore adjustments to legislature that will keep the second amendment while still making things safer for those who can't defend themselves when the worst scenario DOES happen?"

MaliciousCompliance,eqnj71w,t1_eqng3xu,1560176604.0,"I've worked in choir with some kids who are homeschooled, and they all seem really happy and healthy. I think the problem is balancing the need to monitor young people's wellbeing with a reasonable amount of privacy. There is WAY too much public scrutiny in public schools, especially on the teachers, (source: was substitute for two years), but at least there are systems and fail-safes to ensure student safety. When homeschooling works really well, I've seen parents take their kids out to a lot of community activities. They can choose groups with a positive atmosphere, which you can't always do in a public or private school. It's awesome, and you can tailor your teaching directly to the small group of students. When it doesn't, there are no systems to preempt abuse. I think for most people, they can't get over the fact that there's no one there for those kids, minority though they be."
