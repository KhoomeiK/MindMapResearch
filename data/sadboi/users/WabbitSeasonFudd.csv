You're on the right track thinking for yourself, except for the suicide part. Your mind and life shouldn't be wasted just as you realize the false world view that's been fed to you. 

Your post gives me hope that people can learn, think for themselves, and grow past the limits of fear planted by your family.

I wish you well on your journey."

My wife went off Paxil many years ago, and consistent with what you're going through, she experienced so-called ""electric shocks"" in her head, teeth, ears. She was taking a low dose, but still had those effects coming off the drug. I can't completely advocate for an alternative but Paxil was not the right med for her at the time. Check out the half life of it, and make sure your provider is stepping down the dosages consistent with that figure. Hydrate, too. But I don't know if hydration helps, I just tell everyone that during the winter. Cheers!"

Cartalk,fc4a0y7,t3_dvgst4,1577410699.0,"Not sure if this helps, but I'd try changing the transmission fluid and filter. 

I have an '08 Tribeca with 270k, running Amsoil Signature in both the crankcase and transmission. I've done a drain and fill + filter twice with the transmission in the 3 years I've owned it, mostly trying to prevent issues that the previous owner might have ignored. To be clear, my transmission still slips from 2 to 3, but the Amsoil seems better than the OEM stuff.

One other (far less labor intensive) trick I've found is to use the manual shifting in Sport mode. With that, you can at least tell your passengers when to expect to have their drinks all over their laps. 

Even if you go with the Subaru Idemitsu OEM fluid, a new filter is a good preventive maintenance step. Not an easy grab being in the driver's side with hardly any room to spin it off, but if your fender liners are as chewed as mine, you'll be able to pry it back to see what mess lies ahead."

Fatherless,erxz7by,t3_c4gzxm,1561396849.0,"You are enough.

I'm mid-40's, and read many things that I went through growing up as well. Only memory of father was when I was 3, never saw him after his abuse of my mom started. 

Last year I re-connected with some half-siblings who swore it was better for me to grow up without him. Too many stories to recount to support that conclusion. But, I know the bitter taste of getting the better end of the deal...and it still sucks. Add to that some interracial and cultural issues, and it's a cluster (I guess I'm that cluster, idk lol).

I hate Father's Day. Even though I have kids now, I hate that holiday. Don't even get me started on grade school ""family tree"" projects. I have no idea of how a dad should act, and it gets in the way with me and my wife fairly often.

If I can give any useful advice having lived with a physical and emotional hole in my support system, it's to take steps to understand what respecting and loving yourself truly means. I haven't found it yet, but I suspect it's the most sustainable way to lessen your ""not enough"" feeling. Without fully realizing that, I feel like I've found myself without some of the essential tools to demonstrate love for my kids. Perhaps that's my overly critical self typing, but it's harder for us to fake it because we've never had an example to follow (even if it was poor)."
