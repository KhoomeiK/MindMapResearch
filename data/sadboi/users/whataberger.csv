Acanthamoeba are naturally occurring amoeba (tiny, one-celled animals) commonly found in water sources, such as tap water, well water, swimming pools, hot tubs, and soil and sewage systems. If these tiny parasites infect the eye, Acanthamoeba keratitis results.


Acanthamoeba keratitisÂ is a rare disease in which amoebae invade the cornea of the eye."
