Same deal. Thinks he’s the shit.

Her face totally fell after he said that to her in front of us all and my heart just broke for her) He has two daughters but the younger was clearly the favorite all along, mostly for being thinner. In their house, you wouldn’t know there was another daughter. All the pics were of the younger daughter. So the older daughter did what anyone in her circumstances would, given the choice: she eloped to the Middle East with a man she met in college. 

It took years for the family to reconcile but damn... I loved her balls. The guy she married is a gem of a person and they’re amazingly happy together."

Yes! This was the case in the Virgin Islands as well. I’m always amazed at the far reaches of the world Indian folks have gone to. Although I lived in Central Africa during apartheid, I actually was not aware of much that was going on there as I was still in grade school. So to know this was happening in just a few countries over is fascinating. I always did wonder very much about the curious mix of names but I thought perhaps it was just “the thing to do” to make it easier to assimilate into the current population hence Jaikishan becomes Jackie and Bhavesh becomes Bob.
