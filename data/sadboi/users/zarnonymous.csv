✅ He does not follow people because of that. He cleared this up in another video because people were attacking him for it.

✅ He did not promote any alt-right ideologies and very clearly does not advocate for anything alt-right. Shapiro isn't even alt-right and I quote from him: ""It is a garbage movement composed of garbage ideas.""


✅ And finally, ""Indians have poopoo in their brains"". Oh fuck, PewDiePie really gone and did it. He really hates those Indians. Definitely not just a T-Series thing he said in a fun diss-track that he personally defused a long time ago. God damn he's so racist.
