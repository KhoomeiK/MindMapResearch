There's a particular quote that's kept me going these past five years.

""At the end of everything, hold onto anything.""

It means, in this world nothing makes much sense and everything is insane and sometimes leaving feels just so easy, however there's something out there for you and once you find it or them you hold on for dear life and you never let go.

I don't know if you're still here but, when shit gets tough, find your thing again."

SuicideWatch,ev3xlwr,t3_cic72e,1564204126.0,"I've wanted to end my life for the past five or so years off and on. I have a lot of bad days, weeks and sometimes months. Some days it takes me a few hours to get out of bed and then it's smooth sailing the rest of the day, until I head off to bed. Other days I find myself eyeing the knives every time I enter the kitchen or just sitting silently with a bottle of pills and whiskey in hand, contemplating what I should do next. 

I never exactly understood why I continued (or am still continuing) on, yet I never actually attempted suicide. I've gotten close a number of times and have the scars to remember those times by, however me being the relentless fucker that I am never allowed myself to die.

Never having been super close to any of my family I couldn't rely on them to pull me out of my daze when the thoughts of suicide were most prominent. I've never really had close friends either, I used them as reason not to off myself for awhile until they all left me. I used my father, just for the hell of it because I as desperate, as well. With no close family or good friends I don't have much. 

There are those who used to be my friends that still speak to me and every once in awhile I see pictures of them all together and happy on social media, without me. And I realize how truly alone in this world I am.
The only reason I've stayed is because I fear what would happen if I fail at the whole suicide deal.

I was going to write something trying to convince you not to commit suicide, however I'm not sure what to say. There really isn't one thing I guess you say in these types of situations and since I don't know you personally I won't bother acting like I do. In a way it's a bit hypocritical, since I plan to take my own life in a few months. However, I wish to help in any way possible, even if its not through my words.

Sometimes you don't have an exact reason for being alive, no real purpose in mind but there's always something, some reason no matter how stupid it might be, to stay. If only for a little while longer."
SuicideWatch,ev3s3gn,t3_ci25z8,1564200753.0,"I don't see turning to religion as the best option for you. I don't want to get too into my personal life but, I used religion as a way to block out suicidal thoughts and help ease my depression. However the expectations the organization I was in had for me only made things worse because I felt as though I had to live up to their standards. It may distract you from your thoughts for sometime but eventually, it all comes back.

I've always had suicidal thoughts/tendencies, however fear has been part of the reason I have never gone too far. I don't fear generic punishment after death, however I do fear the pain of dying and the fact that there might be literally nothing after this. Like, my mind cannot wrap around the fact that there might literally be nothing after I die. No god, no heaven or valhalla, no rebirth or anything of the such, just the void with no consciousness  afterwards. 

And I think it's like that for most people, because as far as we know, we're the only ones who give a shit about what happens after death. You don't see crocodile's walking around (or swimming?) having an existential crisis, we're the only ones. And, in the grand scheme of things, it kinda feels lonely. Because there's no real us, just our brain, most things are automatic especially those we think aren't. But even if we are just flesh bags with nothing that's real about us, deep down there's something special, some sort of awareness.

And that awareness is about the only thing we have in this big strange world, so that must mean that something made us special, even if it was just some form of cool evolution."

I couldn't find anything of use about this particular topic online, so I thought Reddit might have something for me. I'm writing a chapter in which the main character is at a funeral and doing a eulogy, so the chapter is going to be filled with heavy amounts of dialogue. Therefore, I was wondering if I could just make the whole chapter entirely dialogue? I mean, I've never seen it done in anything that I've read before so is it even a thing people do? Or do they just choose not to do so because it's ""bad writing""?"
