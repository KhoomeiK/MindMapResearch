I tried jumping off at 2mg subutex in 2015 and i think i have PTSD from it. Withdrawals, even knowing i might withdrawal if something happens to my script or something, put me into a panic.

I wrote up a big thing one time in this sub about how i dealt with pretty bad withdrawal symptoms. The main thing i learned in that was to stay calm but its hard to do that when panic is an involuntary response.

It was six weeks of terrible withdrawal followed by the worst depression ive personally ever experienced. I gave in because I was borderline suicidal

pussypassdenied,fqpprhl,t1_fqpnpe2,1589551659.0,"Growing culture of rape accusations? Isnt it like, .0004% of sexual assault reports are false, u/beat_women_exe?

Look, as a woman i like a man to stand up for himself just as much as you guys do, which is why I sub to this group, but rape accusations are far more often true than not. I've been sexually assaulted several times in my life as a petite, average looking woman. I reported it once when i was 14 and was nearly raped by a 40 year old man. And the police did nothing while I received death threats from his SO after being traumatized by him. And then my boss drove me to an unknown location and assaulted me, when i was an adult. And i didn't report it because i was one small janitor and he was the head of a company.

More often than not, when its true we arent believed. And when we might be believed. No one gets prosecuted. Not even when its a minor thats been assaulted. Perpetuating this idea that false accusations *that are reported* are on the rise contributes to a lot of women not getting justice, and serial sexual assaulters left on the streets.

The reason you see stories about false accusations in the news is because *they are the exception*. If it happened all the time, it wouldn't be reported because its not interesting."
