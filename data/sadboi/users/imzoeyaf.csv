Vietnamese,fpr0gwg,t3_g4ylq0,1588838068.0,"Song Lang is by far the most amazing Vietnamese movie I've seen, and this is coming from a native Viet. Sadly it is really hard to find online. I've been trying to look for a version with Engsub online for my boyfriend but I haven't succeeded lol. It premiered with English subtitles though, but sometimes their Facebook page  [https://www.facebook.com/songlangthemovie/](https://www.facebook.com/songlangthemovie/)  shares limited streaming dates for the movie."
Vietnamese,fpqzs1v,t3_gf13yq,1588837399.0,"Phương is not phoenix, Phượng is, very small difference. 

I found this website  [https://doctailieu.com/tu-vi/dat-ten-vy-cho-con-gai](https://doctailieu.com/tu-vi/dat-ten-vy-cho-con-gai) which explains the name Vy.   
 

* Phương Vy: Theo nghĩa Hán - việt, ""Vy"" (""vi"") có nghĩa là nhỏ, màu nhiệm, hay dùng để nói hoa tường vi, hiện nay với tên riêng mọi người hay sử dụng ""Vy"" hơn là ""Vi"" đấy là theo quan điểm của Nhật thì tên có vần ""y"" sẽ mang nhiều may mắn và hạnh phúc hơn ""i"" , từ ""Phương"" có nghĩa hương thơm. ""Phương Vy"" có nghĩa là hương hoa. Tên ""Phương Vy"" gợi đến nét đẹp dịu dàng, e ấp, kiêu sa, tính cách nhẹ nhàng, thùy mị  


So your name basically means *flower scent,* the flower here is specifically hoa tường vy, which is the Multiflora rose. The name also hints elegance, gentleness, tenderness."

He works 8 hour night shifts 3 days in the weekend and it fucks with his stamina throughout the week, but after talking it out, finding the root of the problem and helping him get more motivated he's actively trying! We also live together so it's easier to help him wake up.

So I think communication is best here, maybe tell him to install a Sleep tracking app and start journaling to plan out stuff ahead"
