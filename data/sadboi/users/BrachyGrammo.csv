fuckeatingdisorders,fqp812g,t3_gk5ut3,1589538326.0,Maybe you could weight at ya doc without him/her telling you how much you gained just saying if your heading in the right direction... thats how me and my therapist do
fuckeatingdisorders,fqmhrz3,t1_fql6pzn,1589477661.0,ye actually changed my therapist because the one i was before wasnt very knowledgeable in E.D.'s so she gave me the card from a college who has experience in this field (where I am now)
fuckeatingdisorders,fql0p4l,t1_fqj4wtm,1589442250.0,I'm in therapy
fuckeatingdisorders,fps0d00,t1_fpr74ja,1588865347.0,Well ye there's always the potential to meet those kinds of people this true ðŸ¤” but at least I'm too old for pedos or maps or whatever those pervs wanna be called (don't care)
fuckeatingdisorders,fog4e03,t1_foffbq7,1587747727.0,"ye but my family and my bf are aware and especially my bf knows exactly what to say and how to act and get me to eat more or stuff ANA considers ""bad"" and also seeing the joy and relief in his face to eat good or even enjoying it is just the biggest reward to me"
fuckeatingdisorders,fof64ny,t1_fo8nkvm,1587727351.0,Same and I do eat better when I'm with others... sometimes its hard tho cuz especially friends or strangers tend to give strange looks or ask question and wondering how little I eat and then comment I need to get some meat on me (which is well meant but dont like the attention) with my family or espacially my boyfriend who is a food lover its easier to eat cuz they motivate me to eat more but dont push too far and judge it me as much...
fuckeatingdisorders,fo7gdnh,t1_fo7bt0p,1587577879.0,ye love to cook as well and also it sometimes helps for me at least to eat with others who enjoy food like sex (but just sometimes)
tarantulas,fnta4h2,t1_fnt6um6,1587237572.0,thanks you saved my day with tha info
relationships,fnhnssm,t1_fnhnava,1586965744.0,I am in therapy still... after all those years but this isnt helping at all
relationships,fnh6ax5,t3_fuspl5,1586955905.0,"being separated from my boyfriend is causing my depressions ans self harm that I had under control for years to get worse... I already have cut myself and almost overdosed on my antidepressant (not life threatening but hat muscle spams and lost consciousness and couldn't talk normally for a day)

And my bf isnt doing better either (not as bad as I did with all this) but he also feels depressed even tho he tries not to show it and be strong for me cuz he is aware...

dunno how much longer we can endure this bullshit"
fuckeatingdisorders,flrnh6b,t1_flrkbfx,1585423865.0,true im still eating less calories then I should (especially with my level of activity) but I'm increasing it little by little so I'm at least functional and with time i might even get to terms of putting on like few pounds without freaking out (then my boyfriend wont at least complain how spiky I am when we cuddle xD)
fuckeatingdisorders,flrn461,t1_flr5b2g,1585423646.0,Thanks this is really encouraging and maybe i will try this even if im not comfy with weighing myself (havent done that for about 3 years.) <3
TotalPowerExchange,flalgzl,t3_fm8xan,1584986213.0,"My Master lives on the other side of town and neither of us has cars and public traffic is well... So as much as it sucks we still dont waver from our duties... I'm sending him my daily reports send him pics and videos when he requests so (or when I just feel like it)

as soon as we will be able to see each other again tho we will have a lot of catching up to do so it will be an really intense reunion..."
EatingDisorders,fialm56,t3_f79d0r,1582303582.0,"that was an interesting research formula (very eye opening questions) 

really great work <3"
EatingDisorders,fi0o5wb,t3_f5pxpz,1582041320.0,antidepressants can help with the depressions and this could also improve your eating (but its not always the case) since some can be decreasing appetite and some do infect increase it but its from pill to pill and person to person different... I would say try it and if it doesnt help or even have bad side benefits just change the dose (after talking with your psychiatrist) or change to an other sort of A.D.
EatingDisorders,fglz7b5,t3_ez7ui7,1580914513.0,You cant never really cure an eating disorder you can just control it... In hard times it will come to the surface and you will have some recaps but thats normal and the most important thing is not to let this discourage you and keep doing the good work. Turn to your loved ones and be open about this and let them motivate you going back on the right track (at least this is what is always helping me) just dont give up just for one set back <3
