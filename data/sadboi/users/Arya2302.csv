MakeupEducation,fqm6cay,t3_gj9rzn,1589472255.0,I think your under eye concealer might be too thick and too much powder under your eye which is why it looks creased and a bit cakey. I have a concealer I use that does it and it's just TOO thick and always makes my under eyes look dry. There is a MAC priming spray that has powder in if you're oily like me that's good but recently I've been using a moisturing primer as I want my skin to look dewy! Spose it depends if you're wanting a matte finish or not x

I will say that my doc was VERY VERY reluctant to refer me because I always epilated and plucked my face the hair wasn't obvious so I had to let it grow out and basically cry to a doctor before they took me seriously but thankfully he was lovely and everyone after that was too.

If your body is struggling to get oxygen another sign would be a really elevated heart rate but the BP check would pick that up. So long as you maintain your colour it's unlikely you're having breathing problems, but if it's a real concern ask for oxygen saturation to be checked if they already checked your lungs."

I was completely heart broken and had no self esteem, I have depression issue and started to hallucinate and generally felt an insane amount of sadness. I lost all my friends at the same time as the break up because we had the same friends and my mum and I had a major fall out. For a few months I was so desperately unhappy I would Google ""reasons to live"" at night and try to find some hope. Eventually I decided that the selfish people were the ones who were forcing me to stay alive and miserable just so they wouldn't have to feel how I did every day so I decided to kill myself. I didn't want to freak myself out and back out so instead of over dosing by taking a large dose all at once I decided to take a couple every few hours to build up an od. Fortunately, after I had taken a certain amount I felt so unwell I couldn't take any more coz I was struggling to not pass out.

Cardio is good, but resistance training helps to build muscle which in turn burns more calories than fat. Depending on how ""fat"" you are lots of running might be and for your lower joints and you may find you get sore quite quickly, BUT you will probably have a higher muscle mass as you are carrying more weight. Like sticking a backpack with 10kg in on a skinny person will build their muscle. Keto diets are good if you think you can sustain it but can alter your hormones if you aren't careful and can be hard on your body to digest high protein diets."

Advice,ffg0ryc,t3_etd956,1579895978.0,I think it's really important to find out who you are without anyone else. 9 years is a long time to be with someone and inevitably take on part of their identity and friend group etc. Spend time figuring out what you like to do by yourself. I like watching horror films and used to enjoy drinking wine a lot. And just have fun being yourself for a while!
Advice,fffw4ax,t3_et9ygk,1579893092.0,"My advice is find a class you have an interest in. It will help you stay motivated, gives you a set time to go so no ""I'll go later"" mentality, you'll meet people and not feel so out of place once you have gone for a while, most classes are conditioning and cardio based which is a good starter for anyone. Cardio and weight lifting are both good for losing weight, I wouldn't take advice solely from Reddit because a lot of these people won't actually know what they are talking about (no offence). If you decide to try out weight lifting get a PT session at least once to run through how to do things and make you a program, again you'll know someone who works there and that might ease off anxiety. Keep it simple pick a class or choose a ""sport"" like running or cycling or weightlifting to start with and try to improve that one thing for a while. Naturally your interest will build and you'll find out stuff yourself."

mentalillness,fdgndzi,t3_el9tf4,1578403078.0,"I was in an awful relationship which I thought was the best relationship anyone could have and I was so lucky. I was 21 and had been with my bf since 14 and at this point we moved in together. He had a habit of lying and specifically about a certain girl and I'd let him off with it dozens of times but this was the last straw for me. 
We were living together and I knew I had to leave, I was going to college that morning and felt awful the whole day knowing I had to pack up and move only 10months after getting the flat. 
I worked with him too, and everyone liked him and thought I was awful for leaving him and how he was so lovely how could I blah blah. 
So I already had been getting help for depression but everything went so downhill so so fast. 
I dropped out of college because I couldn't cope, I met a much older guy which was a huge mistake but I didn't know what I was doing and I felt trapped and I wanted out very quickly but he was very controlling. My mum and I fell out massively and at that point I decided I was going to kill myself because I had absolutely nothing to live for. All my friends were my ex s friends so I had no one, no self worth and saw no way out of what was going on. I had started self harming again and was hallucinating as well so I was just all in all a mess. 

Now 6 years on I live in a beautiful house with my fiance and our pet dog. My mum and I have a wonderful relationship, my family and my friends are very supportive. I've got a degree and looking to start a career. I still struggle with depression but my life is no where near that dark hole I felt I was stuck in.

Yes there are a lot of jobs but not enough jobs that pay enough for you to live a decent life and have your own home. Not enough to pay off the debt you are in due to a degree which ultimately has put you at a disadvantage. 
Why should someone with a master's degree who committed up to 7 years of their life to a subject work for less than 9 p/h in a crappy job when their knowledge could actually have been used? 
My friend couldn't get a job out of university and took ""any job"". Now he will never get to work in computing because he has been out of it for too long and never got out of the job he was in.

It also shaped my style etc. So for me horror is a big thing all genres of horror- I love comedy horror as much as slasher films etc. I do not sleep well however as I have mild insomnia but find any nightmares I have are emotional and personal situations.

My mum has had her breast cancer come back and a small nodule in her lung which may mean it's spread and therefore incurable. My sister is off work with stress and has been most of this year, she struggles with stuff and is quite an open person so it's never hidden. My fiance also has his own things going on so I don't want to bother him too much but sometimes things just feel too much. I'm not much of a Cryer and I usually keep how I am to myself although I do have depression issues. I think the hardest part is that my mum did everything she could for my sister and I, she has had the worst run of luck and circumstance her entire life and this just really upsets me. I wanted her to be able to retire and have an amazing time until the end and now it might be marred with taking tablets etc. I just feel like she's never had a break. It makes me so angry and bitter that such a wonderful person has had to cope with so much. I'm sorry for everything you're going through too, being the one to deal with it all is so hard but it doesn't mean you have to be strong all thw time. If I'm really needing to just have time to feel awful I have a bath and just cry in there and pretend it's just water haha.
