AskPinkPillers,fr470m0,t1_fr44k4e,1589878055.0,"> **2 year old boy shot and murdered his mom in Walmart**

I highly doubt that this was calculated or intentional. I'd imagine she was carrying concealed and just put the gun in her purse unholstered, which is a bad idea for a lot of reasons.


> **6 year old boy shot and murdered a girl, during school, who didn't like him.**

> Kayla Rolland's assailant was a six-year-old male first grader at Buell Elementary School in the Beecher Community School District, located in Mount Morris Township near Flint, Michigan. His father, Dedric Owens, was in jail for violating parole, having previously been convicted for possession of cocaine ""with intent to deliver"" and burglary.[2] The boy had been living with his mother Tamarla, and his eight-year-old brother. His mother was evicted from her home, having been unable to pay rent with the $175 weekly wage she received from the two jobs she worked under Michigan's welfare to work scheme. Both boys then moved into their uncle's house, where they shared a single sofa as a bed. The home was a crack house operated by his uncle and a 19-year-old man where guns were frequently traded for drugs, and at some point the child had found a loaded Davis Industries P-32 .32-caliber handgun under some blankets.[3][4]

>The boy was known to have behavioral problems, and was made to stay after school nearly every day for saying ""the F word,"" flipping people off, pinching and hitting. Some weeks before the shooting he had stabbed a girl with a pencil. Chris Boaz, a seven-year-old classmate, claimed the boy once punched him because he would not give him a pickle. The boy had attacked Kayla Rolland before and, on the day prior to the killing, tried to kiss her and was rebuffed. Early on the morning of the shooting, the boy and his brother got into a fight with Boaz's 10-year-old uncle, who punched the boy who then according to Boaz's grandmother said ""Do you want me to take my gap out and shoot you?""[4]


Seems like there was a lot more going on here than just male aggression, and doing so ignores the obvious problems that were happening in this kid's life, which are faced by lots of other kids as well"
