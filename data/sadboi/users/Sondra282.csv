Since you don’t want “violent” toys in the house. Here’s some ideas. Have a balloon fight outside, play with him on the trampoline (if you have one), play tag, play wrestle, tickle, basketball, pool time etc. 

I think that will make improvements without even having to discipline. However, if you still want to, I would say a ten minute timeout would suffice ALONG with daily rough house play."
Parenting,fp3lyrd,t3_gb3y0n,1588281650.0,"Your son seems like a good kid. 

Here’s my input. An important part of development for boys is “rough housing” (wrestling, play fighting, tickling, etc) because it teaches them boundaries- what hurts and what doesn’t, what’s okay and what’s not okay, where you’re allowed to touch and where you’re not, WHO you’re allowed to play fight and who you’re not, etc. It’s also important for girls as well. Now, if he is not getting that sort of interaction, he may very well be subconsciously taking it out on the dog with a lack of boundaries involved."

Like I said, I am 7 weeks postpartum.

Again, my body lacked muscle from pregnancy. I was merely wondering if it would impact my butt at all. 

I have been doing yoga morning & night once I felt my body was ready after pregnancy. I plan to do yoga for the long-term because of the positive benefits, even if it made my butt completely disappear.

It is backed up by actual facts and only seems like a conspiracy to those who are fed information (lies) from social media and various news platforms that are used to keep people in check. Regarding the last statement that dad wrote, that you all seem to think is “wild”, he is referring to Marshall law. If you don’t know what that is, and I’m literally quoting the definition, it is “the imposition of direct military control of normal civilian functions by a government, especially in response to a temporary emergency such as invasion or major disaster, or in an occupied territory.” This happened in China. This is starting to happen in California (in the first stage: it is now against the law for them to leave their homes unless they are working or going to the grocery store). Californians are slowly losing their rights. We, US citizens, are slowly losing our rights like a frog in a boiling pot. And now there is talk in the government that soon they will be forced vaccinations for the virus.  He is taking about potentially using that vaccination for ID chips. The government is testing to see what we are willing to let them do. We are letting them quarantine us. We are letting them shut down businesses. Will we let them give us forced vaccinations in our own bodies? Will we let them fine us for leaving our homes? Will we let the military become the police and roam the streets if we do not comply?
