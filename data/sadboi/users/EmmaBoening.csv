CPTSD,fn3brw1,t3_fyvjpg,1586617422.0,Moving trauma thru the body is exhausting it’s like baptizing a fucking cat! I see you! You’re doing everything right and it inspires me to keep going. This work ain’t easy-
love,fn3b17m,t3_fyvivi,1586616962.0,Too adorable. <3
CPTSD,fn3asfa,t3_fyzb3n,1586616811.0,"God. My heart breaks for you bc I understand you. I award you for being able to figure this out because you’re on the right path..Im 20 years older than you and now I’m finding out what c-ptsd is. We think we suck and we fucking don’t- Being raised by emotionless robots wired our brains goofy. That’s the hardest part to accept. I swear I’ve said”why am I like this” a million times...only to find out it’s not our fault one bit. Your health problems are related to trauma  read “The body keeps the score” (it’s long but crucial in your understanding of how to recover from this) and do some digging for answers. Question EVERYTHING. I promise you’ll be able to handle your demons, it’s not easy.  Don’t hang out with shitty people either bc apparently we subconsciously seek them out. And that’s advice I got but never understood. So really think about it. Do not invite anything but peace into your world. Something you never had enough of.
Lonerwolf.com gave me a new way of thinking about everything. Time for your healing you sweet beautiful soul. I can not tell you how lucky you are that your life is really just about to begin if you let it.

And get away from your family as soon as humanly possible and don’t feel guilty."
CPTSD,fn391vn,t3_fywcxx,1586615724.0,"Anna Runkle on YouTube: Told me wtf is going on bc you’re not imagining any of your struggles.     The holistic psychologist’ on Instagram (Dr Nicole): helps me maintain and the future self journal, really it changed my life.   Recently found: Lonerwolf.com “dark night of the soul” if there’s something that will begin your healing journey on a beautiful though, scary level look into that and your shadow self. I could puke bc this work is SO hard, but our lives will be awful if we don’t pick up the pieces our caretakers shattered. Remember too, people sometimes are doing the best they can..not an excuse. But who has to deal w it now? We do. Take our lives back bc I’m sure you’re fucking amazing too! We can’t give up bc we can’t live like this, we are full of light and love and deserve to show it to the people who see the potential in us."

ptsd,fd611nf,t3_ejsv2x,1578184036.0,"FUCK THAT SHIT. YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE PTSD. USE IT. I’m so sorry to hear this bc I know how this feels. People have NO idea the living nite mare that is ptsd and no, not just vets either.  Ugh. I hate people."
mentalillness,fd607kw,t3_ek1807,1578183726.0,"After dating a drug addict, it’s only still maybe. But my brother is doing the same thing as yours...and I’m positive he’s not on any drugs. Wish there was anything we could do. It’s so upsetting. Make sure to take care of yourself first. I know how you feel and I’m sorry. I wish I had any answers. Xoxo"
Anxiety,fd5zgyk,t3_ek43wz,1578183459.0,"Idk but sammmmme bc Wellbutrin. Wow what a piece of shit sad depression anxiety mess I was. Truly sad, yes. Better now tho"
ptsd,fc8binz,t3_egn622,1577531186.0,"Unfortunately, yes it’s normal. I say unfortunately because PTSD blows. I’ve found that if I’m under stress that keeps mounting I literally go insane. We disassociate bc the brain is protecting us from imploding due to the hyper vigilance and all the other bullshyt that goes with it. Reading ptsd symptoms and living them are ENTIRELY different. It’s so much worse than it sounds. Pls take care of yourself. Putting yourself in the trauma trigger is bad...so it closing is good. Your body needs to process the trauma in order to heal and it feels like baptizing a cat. Read, research, and get a diagnosis so you can get proper treatment. Self awareness is huge. You’ll get there and be better eventually, just ignore the setbacks and try moving forward. Take care of yourself I can not stress that enough. Rest, eat etc. yes- all simple things but they fall to the wayside when you’re in fight or flight mode constantly."
ptsd,fc8adol,t1_fc2g6du,1577530461.0,Damn. Love how our bodies change and meds go whacky. I’m thinking about ya. Sending warm vibes and I hope you can advocate for yourself soon and see a Dr. to get you anxiety down. THE day I turned 18 I was at a psychiatrist bc nobody in my family took me seriously. Thank Gaga for reddit so you can get feedback and see what other people do to cope in the meantime. Xoxo
abusiverelationships,fc853od,t3_egl4cv,1577527069.0,Do abusers all grab the same dialogue from a book bc too familiar. Fvcking loser narc sociopathic waste of flesh human garbage.
mentalillness,fc4c3q3,t3_efvuwa,1577412373.0,It’s treatable. So if he denies treatment it’s unfair for you to try this hard. I have PTSD and depression etc. so this is how I see it from a perspective of someone who has been like him. Treatment is not cut and dry but when willing it’s possible
ptsd,fc4bvdd,t3_eg0mys,1577412185.0,Oh yeah for sure major congratulations that shit’sbrutal

ptsd,fc1ysjp,t3_efngdq,1577333995.0,"Meds can react differently in everyone. A psych med gave me bipolar symptoms and I wanted to totally kill myself. I am not bipolar. Now, I’ve thought “I wanna die” enough times but this was different. If you feel that way and the dr tells you it’s all in your head don’t take that as an answer. You know YOU. I hope this helps at all I’m so sorry you’re suffering. Xanax helps a lot but some view it as controversial. How long have you been on the fluoxetine?"
Anxiety,fc0iuvc,t3_effma9,1577291804.0,Wellbutrin has no sexual side effects...well the lowest. It’s quite interesting actually as it is an antidepressant in a separate class. Not an SSRI. kinda gave me anxiety getting used to it so get some Xanax or Valium maybe. Def helped me. We’re all different but if you’re worried abt it maybe give it a try. Good luck !
Anxiety,fc0i1g9,t3_efi17t,1577291294.0,"Hello. Anxiety here, the best way to shroom is grind it up and put it in a tea bag with tea and steep in hot water. I just leave the bag in. It kinda hits you instantly and is a bit more mild of a come on and peak. You never get stomach issues either as you may when you eat them. Just remember that you can always take mire but you can’t take less."
Anxiety,fc0hngd,t3_efhvg8,1577291050.0,Yup. Absolutely. If I didn’t have Xanax you may as well just dump me in the trash.

truechildfree,fbxlzai,t1_fbvgz6a,1577193371.0,"I feel this so much. My mental health is a g d job in itself, it could definitely be way worse but ummm yeah- Just the thought of a relationship makes me nervous. For instance, what if their (often hidden) mental health issues snowball then avalanche down on me? After I was the one worried about not holding mine together. I can’t handle someone else as it is, but one who bottles it up and won’t do the work, can potentially be devastating. I’m screwed up enough. Then, on the flip side being with someone who is “normal” made me feel even weirder. They simply couldn’t relate. So yeah I’ve given up. Lonely but sane. :(:"
ptsd,fbfo0h9,t3_ecnscy,1576815539.0,I got thru the intake and the therapist said I can have NO thc in my system in order for it to work. I use thc medically for pain and she kinda said HowBadDoYouWantToHeal so I kinda quit seeing her. Any of u do the marijuana while emdr is in your life??
CPTSD,fb2yex2,t3_eb2o3w,1576460103.0,Stay on vivitrol forever if you need to. And that’s okay!
abusiverelationships,fb2y7fw,t3_eb473f,1576459988.0,RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN.
CPTSD,fb2xb8e,t3_eb094s,1576459493.0,"I’m so with you. Thank you for articulating. It’s just been me & my weed. Occasional quick meet ups w girlfriends and that’s it. Meds, therapists and everything. When will it make a dent?!"
abusiverelationships,fb2w6qf,t3_eb5ki7,1576458876.0,Get away.  Get away fast. This trauma can forever affect your life in a negative way. You MUST go no contact-  and I mean zero. That includes threats and cries for suicide MUST BE IGNORED. Shows up in public: do not speak. The moment you engage sets you back months. This disease they have is way bigger than us. Get police and family involved ASAP when that really bad feeling in your guts takes over your existence take action to protect yourself by getting away. I have all my love rooting for you. I know it’s not easy in any form. But you have so much healing to do bc he has made you forget the wonderful and resilient human spirit you are. Please help yourself and RUN. I see u.
therapy,fb2u939,t1_fb2n4ol,1576457803.0,Me too!!! SAME & what is wrong with these trash humans  they make me ill
Herpes,fb2ttaa,t3_eau9px,1576457565.0,SO many ppl have it and just fvcking pretend they don’t it’s great. :( Denial is a bad coping mechanism & instead of reaching out to help break stigma- They hide in the shadows all clueless. Ppl treat it like a death sentence. Genital warts don’t even get the press herpes does. I’d rather have herpes I guess??
Herpes,fajc2xm,t3_e9813c,1576131322.0,You articulated that so well. I feel exactly the same. I hate it. Thanks for posting this.

ptsd,f9jsehs,t1_f9hyqkm,1575384576.0,Yes. And reading the symptoms vs. *having* the symptoms is wild. They don’t seem too bad until it’s you who is experiencing them. The bodily reactions you couldn’t pay to control creep up from who knows what. I see you all. My love and respect to the survivors. Even if we wish we didn’t.
ptsd,f9ckbep,t3_e12rwn,1575224674.0,I did FMLA so if I was bugging out I could leave and not get fired. You need to work for a place employing 50 or more ppl for at least one year to flex this benefit tho.
Condom,f962z0d,t3_dgidtw,1575139017.0,“ONE” the thinnest ones. I think they’re called zero thin. Order at luckybloke.com. Worth a try. I HATE condoms but these feel like I keep checking if it’s even on. Good shit man.
Herpes,f95z513,t1_f6vmibw,1575137423.0,The game changer for me has been continually taking a monophasic birth control pill. So you basically don’t have a period as it’s a known trigger. It’s not dangerous and it really helped me. I don’t take any acyclovir or anything and get mmmaybe one occurrence a year. I take lysine too. The first year was horrible and I send you all my love and strength. I mean it xoxo
Herpes,f95x9ds,t1_f611aoh,1575136727.0,"I am with you. My self worth teetering from ‘no big deal’ to ‘what the fuck’ and crying abt everything in between. I only don’t have symptoms bc I stopped my period w birth control. But guess what: It’s still there. My old cunt boss told everyone at my job and my parents and my in-laws. Humiliating. Yeah ppl have still wanted to f me but it was always toxic dudes bc I somewhere deep down, bc hsv-2 I hate myself[even if I don’t feel it] so it’s what I think I deserve. And, it’s been over 15 years...of major ups and downs. It’s not that I care what ppl think of me NOW THAT everything is publish in my area abt me, I care what it makes ME feel abt me the most."
Anxiety,f6pksqb,t3_ddaht7,1573058540.0,I would beat the fuck out of someone if they did that to me omg bc are you serious?! U poor thing. GAD and PTSD are not a picnic AT ALL.
Anxiety,f6p97u0,t3_ca00xx,1573050862.0,That is PTSD. Living it from a similar ordeal. It is debilitating sometimes.
Anxiety,f6p8avl,t3_dol2ju,1573050185.0,"oh wow, yeahhh that sounds like ptsd. Surreal, ain't it? The whole 'not the same' is all too familiar. Reading about the symptoms and having them is strange to come to terms with I've found, because it doesn't sound \*that\* bad...But oh, it is. Worse if anything. I'm sorry for you bc I truly understand...Esp on the basis of having trauma from a relationship that was terrifying. I'm doing Wellbutrin, bc ptsd destroys your self worth and causes major depression. For the anxiety I do belly yoga breathing to calm the fight/flight response. If that doesn't work I pop a Xanax bc there's really no other remedy. Look into EMDR. CBD is good too. I've been doing the medical weed and sometimes it helps, sometimes I'm worse from it. This doesn't resolve on it's own, sadly. Get therapy from someone who specializes in ptsd. Really take care of yourself. The healing process is kinda exhausting. Sleep, movement, and nutrition are imperative in your recovery. I wish you good days. xoxo"
Anxiety,f6h8jv4,t3_bom417,1572839633.0,"Yes I have severe anxiety and ptsd from trauma. Caused unexplained physical pain and memory blackouts...It sure is tuff for us. If you can do CBD it is helpful...In all forms. If You can get AC/DC (Cannatonic) weed, DO IT. cbd: 18%.  thc: 0.65%. I'm doing EMDR in a month and will keep you posted. Doctors definitely dismiss what we are going thru. if they never dealt with it themselves. Shhhhiiitttt...I still read symptoms about it online, THAT I HAVE, and still don't always come to terms with it. You need to be treated by a professional who has empathy and that validates your experiences and struggles.

I hope you are doing better!"
