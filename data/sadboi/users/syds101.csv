PM: Murad Clarifying Cleanser, The Ordinary retinol serum,  The Ordinary alpha arbutin serum, The Ordinary buffet serum, The ordinary caffeine solutions (for under eyes), Ole Henricksen sheer transformation perfecting moisturizer, Mario Badescu hyluronic eye cream 

The Ordinary Retinol Serum: This has Squalane in it, so it feels oily when you apply it. Ive been using this product for 8 weeks and I really am impressed with my skin! My skin looks plumper and fines lines are looking diminished. My skin has smoother texture as well!

The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin Serum: Has a thick but also watery consistency. I love this serum. I‚Äôve been using this product for a few months now. It really does help lighten up some hyper pigmentation in my face caused by acne. 

The Ordinary Buffet Serum: Feels somewhat sticky upon application. Since I started using this serum in early 2019, my skin has been noticeably brighter and smoother. I think this is a great pair with the retinol serum."
