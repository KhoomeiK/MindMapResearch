YES. Me too. I got a dog a year and a half ago, and I've been trying to be a Good Dog Owner. With that comes the realization that many dog owners just don't care. Poop is not picked up, dogs are off leash in areas where they should be leashed, dogs are left outside in yards to bark aggressively at passers-by, some small dog owners think it is perfectly ok for their dogs to bark at every other dog that is in sight. The last one bothers me particularly, because, as a large dog owner, I've had to work really hard to stop her from becoming reactive. When a small dog barks at her when we are out for a walk, she interprets that as an attack and her instinct is to protect me. It's been a lot of work and an ongoing process to get her to stop trying to lunging and barking back."

2. I'm a defensive player, so I wall up my cities and make great use of ranged units. Sometimes, not often, I attack early in the game. I only do this if the target is easy, or if I've already had to go back to a save game and have realized that I *must* take a civ city's out before they take mine out or expand into my territory.  I make a lot of use of save games for do-overs. If I want to attack after walls go up, I wait until I have a good set of seige weapons.
