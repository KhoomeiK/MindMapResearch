Eating disorders can feel big, intense, dysregulating, and can ultimately leave us incredibly vulnerable. In a lot of ways, I'd go as far as to saying the experience of having an eating disorder has the potential to be pretty traumatic. With that said, it'd be absurd to not feel a strange sense of nostalgia about such a raw and meaningful (even if in a harmful way) time in one's life, and reminiscing or even missing such an intense period is to be expected.

psychologystudents,ewnravj,t3_cp2ijv,1565587497.0,"Hey there! 

Everybody keeps saying your plans are ""ambitious"", but honestly I think they're perfectly reasonable and you have a lot of potential for success.

I  was on the same path as you for quite a long time. Admittedly, I realized (after several stubborn years and a lot of identity crises) that the grad school route was better for me than med school personally, but for the most part, I was a Psych major planning on pursuing medicine.

I think that a psych major is great. If that's what you're passionate about, then do it.   
The bio minor is also great, especially if you're wanting to get into more upper-level bio classes. Upper level science looks good when applying to med school.

Something you'll hopefully learn soon is that med schools really don't care what you major in. They'll hardly look at it.   
The bulk of what matters is that you perform well in the required courses (Gen Chem, Bio, OChem, Biochem, Physics, etc.), get a good MCAT score, and have a solid extracurricular life. (Obviously this is a simplified list of life as a pre-med, but...) Essentially, majoring in psych should in no way hold you back from being adequately prepared for med school. If anything, a social sciences major will give you a more well-rounded education and help you to learn about healthcare from a different angle than, say, your chemistry/biology/biochem-major peers.  
(I'll also add that I think it's kind of pointless for schools to have a pre-med major. My university does not, and we are known for our prestigious medical school and apparently churn out massive numbers of diverse future-med students, none of whom have ""Major: Pre-Medical"" on their transcript. lol)

I hope this provided a bit of valuable information or at least some perspective.   
If you have any questions or concerns, let me know! Best of lucky with your first year of undergrad!

2) There are SO many (a horrifying amount) non-UW affiliated groups/people dining on campus in the summer, and I imagine the likelihood of the complaints coming from one of these individuals is quite high. 
Not to be harsh but... if you haven‚Äôt had complaints from actual students/residents in the past, then why should they use they word of essentially a random person against you? (Again, I know this is harsh and that everybody‚Äôs experience matters, but like... ehhh. Gotta think about main clientele.)

Obviously I can't speak for your experience, but at least for me personally, I think that deep down I felt a level of shame over being gay that I thought I could compensate for by appearing more feminine. Especially with being out and people knowing, I wanted to be more essentially straight-passing I think as a way to make myself more socially acceptable. Like at least even though I was a lesbian, I didn't fit the stereotype, which made me more unspokenly digestible and less taboo.

By now, I don't really care. I'm still overall a pretty feminine person, but at this point I really own The Gay and have no problem manspreading every once in a while. lol
