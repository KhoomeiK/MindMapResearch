My father told him to write a new letter because he will personally deliver it to Santa. 

He wrote ""Dear Santa, why you didn't bring me anything if I was a good body this year"", he also draw what he wanted, a simple gameboy. So my dad is going to get him one so he won't think Santa forgot about him.

I don't have a good relationship with my mom, if fact I dont talk to her AT ALL and we live in the same house, everything is so toxic in my house and I just spend all day inside my bedroom, sometimes I can hear her talking to my brother about me and how ""dramatic"" I am while I hear my brother trying to imitate my anxiety/panic attacks to make her laugh. They also make fun of my scars and about the fact that I have problems with selfharming. They are so unsupportive and the cause of most of my insecurities and mental problems, I decided to cut them off and don't talk to them. I'm also planning to move out for the sake of my mental health. You are not alone, I understand you."
