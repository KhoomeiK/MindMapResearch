after taking shit and repressing for too long.

I don’t self-harm, other than I do have a nervous picking habit - have gone thru phases of biting nails, picking my scalp, picking my skin. Oh and I bite my lip a lot and clench my jaw without awareness. I think those are more anxious habits than self-harm.
