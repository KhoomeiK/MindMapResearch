Anxiety,fp1dn9n,t3_gaarcc,1588232044.0,"same for me with waking up. also, when i get too anxious, after a while my left side of chest starts hurting. it feels like heart pain. at the beggining i would think i was having a heart attack because of those pains. it would get hard to breathe from that thought and then i would have a panick attack.
a huge problem solver to me was getting a good chiropractor. i went to one of the best in my city, she used to work for our olympic teams and city’s basketball team. she explained that those pains are muscles that got tense and painful just because of stress/anxiety. after a while of working with her those pains got less and less frequent. maybe this would help you too. our bodies very respond to stress, so taking care of it too is a must"
