The challenge to their beliefs in the face of irrefutable facts actually makes it worse. It just feels hopeless sometimes.

“The only people being pedantic are the ones who are twisting* his words to further their agenda. Why not show what he actually said instead* of lying or exaggerating?”
“The only people I know who take it this way are people on reddit”

So which is it? Pick. It’s either the news agencies, “the ones” who have whatever fucking agenda you tinfoil hat, Pizzagate obsessed nut jobs won’t shut up about, or people on reddit. If it’s only people on reddit who take it this way, then it can’t be the news agencies. If it’s the news agencies, then it isn’t “only” the people on reddit etc.. Also, if you’re going to be a pedant, at least correctly spell the words you’re trying (and failing) to accurately use. Otherwise fuck off with the pedantry, and take the hidden agenda, bullshit conspiracy seeking with you.

“Why not show what he actually said instead of lying or exaggerating? He said if there was a treatment that could be injected into the human body... that was as effective as disinfectants on the outside, it would be good.” 

That is not what he said, as has been quoted repeatedly in this thread, and now you are twisting his words to imply whatever furthers YOUR, PERSONAL, agenda. And if he meant vaccine- JUST SAY FUCKING VACCINE. He didn’t, because he can’t, because he doesn’t have the mental capacity and ability of even a 10 year old. Hence quite literally everything that he has ever word vomited. Otherwise he would realize no shit scientists have thought of a fucking vaccine because that’s what they fucking do for a LIVING. Years upon years upon years of education and training, of which he has received none- and you’re gonna defend fuckin President Cheeto Jesus for not being able to come up with the word vaccine and instead adderall rambling about something “like” injecting disinfectant? Acting like it’s some brilliant new concept, this genius new “cleanout” idea of his? 

The hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance are fucking off the charts levels of astounding in you people."

Others are in pain too, not just you. So don’t evaluate someone else based on what you were able to do during an episode. Good for you that you were able to do that. Just because you can doesn’t mean she can. Very show off-y and gross."
