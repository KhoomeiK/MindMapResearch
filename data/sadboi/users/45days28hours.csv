bipolar,fr4cw9q,t3_gmllzf,1589884102.0,I do acid like twice a year 10/10 would recommend. Molly? Imho don't do it. 1 you could get serotonin syndrome  and 2 the comedown is incredibly painful and will probably send you into a major depression. Also research how these drugs effect the brain.

asktransgender,fqwdv7e,t3_gl3hv0,1589700938.0,"FTM. I've had these thoughts too and I got some lovely advice from my best friend. Right now you are at a crossroads. A lot of people, especially cis people, think the choice is between action (transitioning) and inaction (not transitioning).  This line of thinking is flawed. 

Both choices are action. Both choices require courage. Just transitioning, deviating from the norm, requires a leap of faith. All incredible decisions require that leap of faith because you can't know the future. This is absolutely terrifying. Staying the same is a choice where you accept your current feelings of life. You choose to stay the way you are and will actively make that choice every single day. 

Starting hormones,  especially during the first two months is reversible. During this time, really think about whether you like the changes that are happening. If you don't that's fine. At least you know what's wrong for you. 

Look within yourself to find yourself.  Who are you? And what do you want?  I'm not trying to push you  one way or another. I'm just trying to give you my perspective on this fear. I'm giving you the explanation and reasoning behind my decision to transition. Do whatever you want with this. I hope it helps."
