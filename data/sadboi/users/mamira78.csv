&#x200B;

I know what your girlfrind is going though because that is what happened to me. Me ex broke up with in a really mean way, although he new my mental issues. 

No one can blame you for wanting to care more about yourself, but if you decide to let her down don't come back to her later when she will be doing better, because, trust me, she wil.

Good luck."
mentalhealth,f6nc037,t3_drz5i4,1572988403.0,"I know how what you are feeling and here are tips that I apply to myself : 

&#x200B;

1. Remember, you are just a human trying as mush as possible to deal with very complex things : find a sense to your live, try to understand why friends left, accepting failures, trying to move on ... It is not easy. But you are tryings, and the fact that you are writing this here is  a proof. So be proud of yourself of being able to know that you need help and to ask for it. Don't be too hard with yourself. 
2. Keep repeating to yourself "" I love myself, I love the man/woman that I am, although I am not perfect I still love me, other might hate me, but I still love myself"". If you decide to wake up, to keep fighting it is for YOU. By love and respect for yourself. 
3. Keep distance with people that might hurt you. For your health keep them away from you. When it comes to your health, you don't have to justify yourself, you need to concentrate on you. 
4. Take a rest. Try to get off social media (I don't know if this is correct but I hope you understand the sense). And take vacation if possible. 

This is how I started to recover from  very  traumatic and mental destructive episodes."

femalefashionadvice,f68zjsc,t3_bry2n2,1572733310.0,"So...Here is my story. 

I love fashion. I used to buy a lot things from the fast fashion industry. But, at some point I felt bad about it. What really annoys me is the amount of waste surroundding the fast fashion industry. And I am not talking only about clothes. But waste of lifes as well (children, animals). That's how I started to wear second-hand or eco-friendly brands<; 

&#x200B;

Today, I am created my own secondhand business. He is the point : The environment had already been damaged by the product being created, so extending the life of the items is the only thing do to at that point. 

&#x200B;

The idea of extending the life product is not new, and it terms of environment protection really interesting. For instance: Elon Musk by creating reausable space launch vehicles is pursuing the same goal.
