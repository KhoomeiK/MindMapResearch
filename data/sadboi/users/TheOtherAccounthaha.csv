AskReddit,fbv3n8n,t3_eeki65,1577124883.0,"Hey Ya - OutKast

The whole song is intentionally misleading as a . Song is about modern day relationships being depressing, empty and unfulfilling.

Examples;
“But separate's always better when there's feelings involved”

“Nothing lasts forever!
Then what makes it, then what makes it...
Then what makes love the exception?”

“So why, oh, why...
Are we still in denial when we know we're not happy here”

Clearly, the song is referring to the fact that many people stay in unhappy relationships rather than doing what’s right for them and leaving."

You just gotta remember that their opinion isn’t final and asking yourself if you truly believe what your doing is the best thing for you at the time. If your having a shit day where you don’t feel like you can do anything, don’t do anything too stressful and know confidently it’s the best thing for you, no matter what the members of authority in your life think :) 

Edit: You know more about yourself than they ever could :)"
