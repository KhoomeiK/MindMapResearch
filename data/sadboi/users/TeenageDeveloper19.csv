I can relate to this, but also not quite relate to this. I feel so weird about it.

I have missed out on a whole lot of memories in my life. I live in a really, really toxic household, one I basically haven‚Äôt left for almost 5 years. I haven‚Äôt been to school since junior high. My folks wouldn‚Äôt let me go. I missed out on my first day of high school, life‚Äôs first ‚Äúreal‚Äù friends, homecoming, rides on the bus, sitting around a table everyday with my friends at lunch, prom, senior year, graduation, days at the mall, and the list goes on. It sucks.

I‚Äôm not sure I can really consider myself to be a part of the c/o 2020. I did get my GED this year, but it‚Äôs not the same. I watched the online graduation thing anyways. And it hurt in the weirdest way.

It reminded me of all the things I missed out on. It reminded me that I‚Äôll never feel sad and melancholic about my high school years, because I never had them. I‚Äôll never look back on that funny memory I made in freshman year. I‚Äôll never look back on that one friend I always hung out with. I‚Äôll never look back on the food fight at lunch. It felt so weird watching my peers celebrate the last 12 years of their lives, and knowing I missed out on arguable the most important part of it.

I was looking forward to a fresh start. Really looking forward to it. College visits. Admitted student days. My first freshman year. And now it looks like I‚Äôm going to miss out on most‚Äîmaybe all‚Äîof that, too.

It hurts. I can‚Äôt even describe the feeling. It‚Äôs so awkward.

I‚Äôm so sorry for all of the seniors that missed out on those last couple of months this year. I can‚Äôt quite relate, but I understand what you‚Äôre feeling. I, like everybody else, can‚Äôt do anything about it. But at least I can congratulate you.

swift,fqcl1ks,t3_gi3em0,1589261057.0,"I‚Äôm 19, and learning Swift and iOS app development for the first time. Firstly, you‚Äôd be surprised at how quickly you can pick this stuff up. Although I‚Äôm far from a professional, my best piece of advice is to simply start coding. Find a book or pick an online course (there are many, many to choose from), study from it a little bit every day or week or whatever, and spend two or three times as much time actually practicing with whatever code editor or IDE you‚Äôll be using. The best way, perhaps the only way, to learn to code is by doing it‚Äî a lot.

Also, ask questions. Lots of them. I‚Äôd advise you to stay away from Stack Overflow, a popular site for asking questions about code, coding errors, etc. I‚Äôve found out the hard way that the site is very, very unnecessarily rough on beginners.   


Finally, know that there‚Äôs lots of material to absorb, but you‚Äôre not expected to remember all of it. There will be all sorts of phrases and names and things that‚Äôll be thrown at you, but no one, not even the professionals, remember it all. Memorize the fundamentals, and the rest is really about learning ‚Äúhow‚Äù to code. It‚Äôs problem solving. You‚Äôll learn how to read documentation and lookup how to solve problems. You‚Äôll inevitably forget a lot, but along the way you‚Äôll learn how to lookup what you need and create the rest.

And, most importantly, have fun!"
