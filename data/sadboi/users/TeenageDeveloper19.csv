I can relate to this, but also not quite relate to this. I feel so weird about it.

I have missed out on a whole lot of memories in my life. I live in a really, really toxic household, one I basically haven’t left for almost 5 years. I haven’t been to school since junior high. My folks wouldn’t let me go. I missed out on my first day of high school, life’s first “real” friends, homecoming, rides on the bus, sitting around a table everyday with my friends at lunch, prom, senior year, graduation, days at the mall, and the list goes on. It sucks.

I’m not sure I can really consider myself to be a part of the c/o 2020. I did get my GED this year, but it’s not the same. I watched the online graduation thing anyways. And it hurt in the weirdest way.

It reminded me of all the things I missed out on. It reminded me that I’ll never feel sad and melancholic about my high school years, because I never had them. I’ll never look back on that funny memory I made in freshman year. I’ll never look back on that one friend I always hung out with. I’ll never look back on the food fight at lunch. It felt so weird watching my peers celebrate the last 12 years of their lives, and knowing I missed out on arguable the most important part of it.

I was looking forward to a fresh start. Really looking forward to it. College visits. Admitted student days. My first freshman year. And now it looks like I’m going to miss out on most—maybe all—of that, too.

It hurts. I can’t even describe the feeling. It’s so awkward.

I’m so sorry for all of the seniors that missed out on those last couple of months this year. I can’t quite relate, but I understand what you’re feeling. I, like everybody else, can’t do anything about it. But at least I can congratulate you.

Great work everyone :)"

I decided not to mention many, many of the “extracurricular” activities I’ve participated in on my apps because, to me, they didn’t seem like EC’s at all. I didn’t want to exaggerate or lie.

I’ve seen people turn casual reading into a “self-learning adventure”, minor chores around the house into “major household responsibility”, helping a kid out with a math problem into “started a tutoring organization”, and now “making a couple PB&J’s” into “starting a large community service org. and touching hundreds of lives”. It makes me realize part of why I got so many rejections. I didn’t boast. I just gave the facts. With all this inflation, in order to give myself a fair chance I should’ve exaggerated like hell.  


Come transfer app time, I think I’ll turn “turning the faucet off when I’m brushing my teeth” into “starting a community-wide waste and environmental awareness movement”. Why the hell not."

swift,fqcl1ks,t3_gi3em0,1589261057.0,"I’m 19, and learning Swift and iOS app development for the first time. Firstly, you’d be surprised at how quickly you can pick this stuff up. Although I’m far from a professional, my best piece of advice is to simply start coding. Find a book or pick an online course (there are many, many to choose from), study from it a little bit every day or week or whatever, and spend two or three times as much time actually practicing with whatever code editor or IDE you’ll be using. The best way, perhaps the only way, to learn to code is by doing it— a lot.

Also, ask questions. Lots of them. I’d advise you to stay away from Stack Overflow, a popular site for asking questions about code, coding errors, etc. I’ve found out the hard way that the site is very, very unnecessarily rough on beginners.   


Finally, know that there’s lots of material to absorb, but you’re not expected to remember all of it. There will be all sorts of phrases and names and things that’ll be thrown at you, but no one, not even the professionals, remember it all. Memorize the fundamentals, and the rest is really about learning “how” to code. It’s problem solving. You’ll learn how to read documentation and lookup how to solve problems. You’ll inevitably forget a lot, but along the way you’ll learn how to lookup what you need and create the rest.

And, most importantly, have fun!"
