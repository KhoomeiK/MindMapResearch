I do have very low self esteem, but i don't feel like i agree with people to like me, I'm mostly myself, I usually just chase women though instead of ""friends"", but I don't know how to lead and how to be ""alpha"", I usually go to night clubs to enjoy myself and socialize and hookup sometimes but that's about it.
