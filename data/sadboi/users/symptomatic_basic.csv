stepparents,f5aq9rr,t3_dneqci,1572111866.0,"Hey, I feel for you. I’ve been there, sort of. 

SO has two adult children (20 and 18), and they rule his life. It’s gotten a touch better with them being adults, being in college now. I agree with all of the other posters here- your SO is doing his daughter a huge disservice. 

The best you can do? Just keep trying with her. I know it’s hard. My SO had a talk with SD this summer because I felt like she was being really hostile towards me and I didn’t feel able to defend myself (I’m 27. Working on assertiveness in therapy, trust me). 

She ended up really hurt that I felt she hated me. But major props to her- she stepped up and acted like the adult she was. We’re building a relationship. The thing with kids is they can absolutely feel when they’re not wanted. I’m not blaming you at all, at ALL, but if she can sense that you’re upset with her actions, it could just fuel her more. It’s really hard to put on a happy face when you feel like someone hates you. But I worked really hard to be open and neutral towards her, and we both benefit now. She reaches out from college sometimes and it makes me so happy. I love her now, but it took time to get here. 

Anyways- she acted eerily similar to your SD at age 16. It won’t get better until things change- whether that’s her dad creating boundaries, YOU creating boundaries (which... if you’re living with SO, you have every right to establish boundaries in your house), or whether it’s adulthood slapping her in the face in a few years. I don’t know man. I feel for you. Bringing SO to therapy with me was immensely helpful in ways I didn’t even anticipate. Highly recommend if you can."

It doesn’t erase the past, but forgiving them allows me to try and see their attempts with a little more grace, while still maintaining that they haven’t always had the best intentions. I struggle  with making excuses for other people and never getting angry or standing up for myself, so it’s a whirlwind in my brain sometimes."

It sounds like what OP said was perfect, and just the fact that he could come to her! Doesn’t matter really what you say- you’ve created an environment of open communication and that’s awesome :) my parents and I have NEVER talked sex and I’m 28"

My attacker wasn’t arrested because there wasn’t enough evidence. Fair enough, but he came after me and destroyed me psychologically. I’m honest to god so encouraged and happy to hear your story. You deserve this resolution; you deserve for this to end."

I keep getting called a bitch because I’m finally standing up for myself. I was a doormat for so long and I’m convinced that’s why people see me as “bitchy” now"
CPTSD,f1a6fzk,t1_f19uk7m,1569286235.0,"So as much as I DESPISE all the cliche phrases and technique suggestions and shit, I’ve actually found the exercise of imagining myself as a child really powerful when I beat myself up for not fighting back more as a kid. I totally relate to what you’re saying, like “Hey my sister fought back and did her own thing, why did I comply?” I get mad at myself, but then I think about a child the age I was when certain things happen. I NEVER would expect them to be able to fight back.  I have to learn to show myself the same empathy I do others.  I’m getting better at showing my childhood empathy, but more recent past is way harder imo"

fatlogic,f0ud0a5,t1_f0t3iow,1568938084.0,"Yes actually! My moms a dietitian who practices HAES(yes laugh all you want). She always explains it that HAES means we shouldn’t judge someone’s health status based on their appearance. It also means promoting BEING healthy at every size. Getting the minimum exercise suggestions. Eating a varied diet with lots of fruits and veggies. By changing behaviors, weight changes typically follow. Case in point, my dad is overweight but has better blood pressure and cholesterol levels than my mom. It drives her up the fucking wall hahaha but she recognizes that despite his weight, he’s healthy. Adding more healthy behaviors is her main goal with him now."

As someone in recovery from a restrictive eating disorder, I agree that starvation mode eventually happens, but yeah. It takes a while. My metabolism is very fucked but it’s not from skipping breakfast, it’s from years eating significantly less than my body needed to operate on a normal level."

fatlogic,ezs86zg,t1_ez8c4oq,1568084616.0,"Thank you for taking the time to write this! I wish we could write text posts here, because I think there needs to be an honest discussion about eating disorders. Lately I’ve noticed a lot of posts taken directly from ED recovery accounts. Seeing those messages misused and bashed here is really difficult. I’m solid enough in my own eating disorder recovery to know that regardless of the comments, my body is still trying to heal. I’m frustrated though, because I know people are here with eating disorders that don’t realize it. Misconstruing ED recovery posts is dangerous for everyone imo."
