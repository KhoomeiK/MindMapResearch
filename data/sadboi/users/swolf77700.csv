No, we should not be teaching young boys the sexual aspect of it, but in the same way we should teach children that somebody may not touch them without permission, that it's not okay to pull someone's hair and if they do, it's because they ""like"" you, that transfers to sexual assault as they grow older.

I don't think any feminist proposes that we do not teach girls the same respect for others. Look at what happened with Lena Dunham. There are few women who would defend what she did because she is a woman. We do have a tendency to focus on boys and men because the instance of sexual assault committed by them is far higher, indicating a systemic issue with how we raise boys. 

Do I think rapists are scum? Yes. Do I think we can't reduce rape and sexual assault by instilling respect for others' bodies and attitudes of consent at an early age? Yes.

You said it right there: society deems these things morally wrong, but just don't care.

Therefore, we teach children what is morally wrong earlier. 

I think you are going under the assumption that men know what consent is, and that is not always the case. Keep in mind that the ""psycho"" stranger at knife point rape is much less prevalent than rape by a friend, SO, or acquaintance.

My stone was a full centimeter and was stuck between the kidney and ureter, so I had to get lithotripsy. Didn't smash it up enough the first surgery, so I had to go in 2 days later for a 2nd one plus stent. 

I never knew before my experience just how bad kidney stones could be. In 2015 I went to the ER with unbelievable pain because it turned out I had a torsed ovary that had become necrotic and was hemorrhaging blood, and they immediately guessed kidney stones before I got all the tests. Turns out most of the external symptoms and pain level is the same. I remember thinking, ""No way is this ""just"" a kidney stone. This is worse than childbirth and I want to die it hurts so badly."" Then, last year, I woke up one night with the same feeling; thought I was going to lose another ovary. Nope. This time it really was a kidney stone. 

The 2 problems were very similar in pain level. You can't eat, talk, vomiting, sweating, screaming sometimes, crying...the only thing that made the ovarian torsion slightly better was that it was a more urgent surgery, so I got in pretty quick once they figured out something was in there that could soon cause sepsis. Kidney stones feel about the same except you're expected to deal with it longer. I will never doubt anyone's kidney stone drama again."

1. The students sit on the desks or stand up. In a circle is easiest, but any established order will do (rows, etc).

2. First student can say up to three numbers or months (in order). For example, she could say ""January,"" or ""January, February,"" or ""January, February, March,"" but no more.

3. Next student continues the months, can say up to three.

4. Whoever is the last thing in the sequence is out and has to sit down. So in this game, you DON'T want ""ten"" or ""December.""

5. Whoever is after that student starts over with January, continue until there's one winner.

You could do this with any concept that is a sequence or great thing to memorize in a certain order. They just love to try and figure out how to strategize to get someone out. It usually takes a few practice rounds before they get how it works, but once they get good at it, they want to play again and again.

Now at the end of my 15th year teaching beginning ESL at a high school where the students are mainstreamed in most of their other content areas. I get so sick of lessons like these at PDs and in our curriculum. So many of our teachers are accustomed to having intermediate and maybe higher beginners, that they forget we have kids who literally begin not knowing how to say ""yes."" Almost no lessons are accommodated for beginners, and it seems like there is very little research on best curriculum for absolute beginners. I know what research says about beginners, agree with it, and practice it in my classroom, but the way the research is manipulated by people who have no idea what it's like to work with beginners and think their ideas are good because ""Hey look, we used sentence stems/frames!"" or ""Ooh, I like how it gives them an opportunity to use a dictionary!""

For years I have fought with goofy curriculum, ridiculous expectations, over-emphasis on state tests which these kids will NOT pass in 7 months. It's frustrating, because I really love absolute beginners and see how effective it is when things are done RIGHT. It's beautiful! And beginner teachers know how great it is. Problem is, there are few of us in a school at a time, so we rarely get the comiseration from others.

I'm a rebel about it, and I know you said the LP was just a suggestion, but even if it were required I personally would just close my door and teach. That's what I've always done, and I make do with whatever silly new learning kit that is in vogue that the district bought for millions of dollars because research says it works for ""struggling readers,"" like my kids look on paper. There is so much more to a beginning ESL student than being a struggling reader. They often blanket them with the same curriculum as gen ed reading students and tell me to ""accommodate it!"" No, how about the novel idea of...a completely different curriculum for beginners?

This has been the struggle of my career. But I enjoy teaching newcomers because they're like sponges.

KidneyStones,flx1nso,t3_frpgdg,1585572691.0,"I had 2 lithotripsy surgeries, 3 days apart. Had a 1 cm stone and the idea was to break it apart enough to pass. In a day and a half, I was in unbearable pain (again) and went to ER. Hydrocodone wasn't doing squat. They kept me under observation with morphine drip for another 2 days while waiting for them to pass. A nephrologist visited me to say he was disappointed the urologist wasn't returning calls (weekend) and that X ray showed the pieces were clustered in the ureter right above bladder. Urologist scheduled second lithotripsy for Monday following. Apologized profusely because he'd been so sure it would be a breeze after 1st surgery.  Second time felt no different than first, only this time a stent was added.

This is not to frighten you, because lithotripsy is a breeze of a surgery for the patient. There is no cutting, no scars, and it's low-risk. I was not fearful of the surgeries at all. I was not that drowsy, compared to other major surgery I went through 5 years ago (oddly, for an ovarian torsion, which feels extremely similar to kidney stones, but is more serious). You just have to keep in mind that it is actually a pretty amazing surgery, and it's going to help you feel much better. In comparison to the worst pain ever and the yucky week I had to wear a stent (uncomfortable, but not painful), the lithotripsy itself was nothing. I was glad to get it.

Also, I left the hospital the next day.

I don't blame you for feeling scared of going to the hospital right now with covid going on. Just remember that these people are pros, and are better at keeping the virus from you than regular folks at the grocery store. It is sad that you won't have somebody there to support you.

So, I do understand what you meant here, but I wanted to know if there is a term for the type of vocabulary that remains Germanic. I know Spanish and studied German in high school. I briefly took some basic linguistics courses but I am by no means claiming to know much.

I ended up teaching ESL to Newcomers and love it very much. I hear waaayyy too much from educators who never worked with beginners about stressing ""academic vocabulary, especially with ESL students,"" and it makes me rage. In 15 years, I have discovered it is absolutely NOT academic vocabulary that is the main issue with Spanish and French-speaking teens who have a decent base in their first language, because it's the ""academic vocabulary"" that tend to be cognates. I realize that is because of the Latin roots of Spanish, but I would like to know more about the Germanic roots so that I can explain that my kids ask what ""would"" or ""bread"" mean, not words like ""commission"" or ""persecution,"" which are often the types of word chosen to focus on in curriculum. My argument has always been that we need more focus with Newcomers on the NON-academic vocabulary, because it's always what they see as the most ""foreign."" Therefore, there is a lack of focus on those words in curriculum for Newcomers. Newcomer teachers aren't given sufficient time to develop basic vocabulary and are rushed to this ""academic vocabulary.""

I'm rambling, but this sticks in my craw. So I'm asking 2 questions I'd like an expert to answer: 
1. Is there a term for the types of words that seem to have retained Germanic spelling/pronunciation vs Latin/Greek/French roots? 
2. Why does it seem that the words that HAVE retained their Germanic roots tend to be more common, everyday vocabulary like ""man,"" ""bread,"" or ""mädchen/maiden/girl,"" whereas the ""academic vocabulary"" my administration stresses seem to have such strong Greek/Latin roots?

Spanish,f9vr6hu,t1_f9vi9jd,1575677552.0,"Exactly what I was thinking. I learned from a great teacher a long time ago:

""Put your hand in front of your mouth and say 'taco.'""

We did it.

""Do you feel breath on your hand? That's because of aspiration on the English T sound. Now try moving your tongue to right behind your front teeth, don't 'explode' the sound, and say it again. 'Taco.'""

I find that this immediately changed everybody's pronunciation and made it sound way less gringo."
Teachers,f9vqns2,t3_e73qxd,1575677157.0,"I did it. She's in our spare bedroom right now. She was 2 weeks away from turning 18, aunt said ""God told me"" to put her on a bus back to Juárez Mexico that left at midnight. Long story, but as you can see, aunt was nuts.

Her mother had sent her to live in the US 3 years prior in order to escape the mortal danger of living in Juarez, especially for young women (google ""feminicidio in Juarez."")
She was born in the US, so she has citizenship, but was taken back to Mexico as a baby. Sent back at age 15. She was a 15 year old freshman in my Newcomer ESL class, and was a perfect student, and I knew her really well because she was always staying after school to volunteer, even when she was no longer in my class. I began to realize that it was not only out of the goodness of her heart, but also because she didn't like being at crazy aunt's house.

I could not bear to see another student shipped back to their home country because an extended relative couldn't put up with it anymore. It's pretty common in immigrant teens. This is one of my favorite students ever, with very good grades, scholarships, near perfect attendance, etc. 

Myself and the rest of the ESL team emailed her and told her to come back, that we would figure it out. No one wanted to see this happen to the girl. We needed to do it within 10 school days so she wouldn't get withdrawn.  So we helped her with a bus ticket back, her friend picked her up at the station, and she went home with me after school the next day.

I called my principal, who was great, and he remembered her because she helped win a debate her freshman year. He spoke to some higher-ups. Her counselor and the aunt got involved.  I think they were ok with it because I let them know about it. Everything was very transparent, and in the end she had my address and phone number listed as home address, me as her guardian. She was 18 and we signed her up for all the benefits homeless students receive, as well as getting a SNAP card. She stayed with us throughout the rest of her junior year and her entire senior year. She visits her family in Mexico about twice a year.

I am happy to say that we now consider her part of the family. She graduated with honors, and is now studying at a public university about 25 minutes away. She still comes to stay with us on weekends because we actually really love her. 

I know this is a special situation. Honestly, there are not many students I would have done it for, and I've been teaching almost 16 years. I saw something of myself in her, and I knew she would not be a behavioral issue, and I saw how much she had accomplished in the US, and was not ok with it being over. Neither was she.

So it turned out to be a very positive thing, even for my husband and young daughter. I am not saying you should take her in, but that if you are honest with admin and counselors, and you feel you can handle it, talk to somebody first and it might be approved. 

Oh, and we had another teacher take in a girl in a bad home situation as well, but I don't know the details.

I am happy to give you any more information if you message me. I'm in Texas."

Ok first of all, we all know that's stupid BS, but there are a couple teachers I work with who agree that it's ""lying."" Help me with all the reasons why using someone's preferred pronouns is absolutely NOT lying. I tried using the definition of a lie: to intentionally deceive or tell a falsehood. Someone says they like a certain nickname, you use it. It's not ""lying"" because ""on the roster it lists that name.""

Tried to use the example of a student I had who really hated his given name because he was named for his father who abused and abandoned the family. What asshole teacher is going to insist on calling him the given name because ""ThAt'S whAt's oN tHe ROstEr!"" 

Most of the teachers I know would certainly use the students' preferred pronouns. This is just a couple I know.

Every experience shared or point made had me fist-in-the-air agreeing. This got me really thinking: what on earth can we do to convince admin/school boards/the public at large that this is a serious issue?

The best way we might get them to? The thing that always matters to them the most. Their bottom line: state tests.

The nation has a common issue with low literacy and consequently, state test scores. In our district, our ELAR scores are such a sensitive issue that we're micromanaged until we want to pull out our hair. 

Maybe they would listen if we could show that:

Typing classes will improve state test scores. 

Internet literacy skills improve problem-solving skills and guide students into reading more carefully. Improve literacy, improve test scores.

Frontloading basic typing, web navigation, and keyboarding skills saves the core teacher's time so they can spend more time teaching actual ELA, social studies, math and science. This will improve state test scores. 

Knowing how to navigate computers and type will give the kids tools for success so they feel like they can succeed. This will improve state test scores. 


Ok, I know that the state test scores are not what should be important. We all know the other million reasons why it's good for students, besides our sanity. I just feel like it's the only reason they'll ever listen to the need for more required basic computation skills, because that seems to be the only thing that matters to them anymore.

Chromebooks carts are one of the best solutions I've seen in 15 years at this school. We got them 5 years ago, and I immediately loved it. 

The password thing: we just don't put up with it anymore. We have a uniform username and password system for everyone, and it doesn't change.

We NEVER have issues with kids misusing other kids' passwords, even though the system is pretty easy to figure out. You just have to know the kid's ID number, which they have to say out loud a lot.
