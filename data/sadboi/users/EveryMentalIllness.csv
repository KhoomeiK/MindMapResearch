However if you do then you can either create an environment or contribute to the creation of one where eating chicken is less harmful to all those involved. For example: I like eating human ass sometimes in a sex way. It's fun because I hate feces but facing your fears makes you braver.

But if someone's fucked up enough to try to maim someone and the victim has the ability to stop them without causing any harm at all (including choking them out and messing with them psychologically) then they've created an outlet for the would-be harmful violence to release harmlessly. Which is something harmful people never get enough of *which makes them so*. It reminds me of my favorite Buddhist story. About how Buddha's village was about to get attacked and when everyone asked him for help he was sayin ""bro do nothin"" then they all got horribly raped and massacred then buddah was all lyk ""yo I fuked up"" And the conclusion everyone settled on was ""oh well even buddah can be wrong how humbling namaste yadayada"" But I think a much more useful pov would be what if everyone in that village had responded by learning BJJ.
