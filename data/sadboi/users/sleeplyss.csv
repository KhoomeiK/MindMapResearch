To me this reads that she thinks once you do the boring grunt work to ""set it up"" then ta-da! You have a business, it runs itself! Anyone who truly wants to start their own business must be someone who WANTS TO LEARN about the MANY, MANY challenges this will entail. The fact that she wants ""help""  (let's be real she wants you to do it for her) with literally the very first step shows me that she lacks the ambition and drive that this would require.

relationship_advice,ezxhyu5,t1_ezwh2cw,1568240947.0,"Just as something to think about - when more and more people get cosmetic procedures, it starts to create a society where, for example, many women have artificially large breasts. When young people grow up, they see this and don't know it's artificial, and think they're abnormal if they don't have large breasts, so they're more inclined to get surgery to look like everyone else. See what I'm saying? It creates a false reality which encourages more and more people to feel the need to have cosmetic surgery to fit in.
