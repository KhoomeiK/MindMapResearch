However, can’t it just be enough to hear something and allow it to bring you joy if that was what it was intended for? I once watched a short video doc about why Post Malone has so many hit songs on the charts and it had something to do with the rhythm and BPM as well as the lyrics being easy to remember. Kinda shook me to my core to think that others put that much thought into the music regarding WHY it’s so well liked. I usually only think about what emotions they were feeling when they were writing; more so with artists like Mac and NF, for example."

Same thing happened to me with a cc I stopped paying on (could no longer afford the ridiculously high payments due to interest, 260+a month) basically whoever bought your debt or is suing you just wants the money, at the end of the day. I didn’t have to go to court, I hired a lawyer who negotiated a payment plan for me. 

Later found out I didn’t even need to do that, I could have negotiated myself. And I did several months later and was able to lower the payment he originally negotiated that was IMO too high as well. He apparently could only settle for $175, which was my MAX when he asked. I settled for $140 monthly. The process is intimidating, no doubt. But as long as you get in contact and either set up a payment plan or pay in full, you’ll be fine."

samsclub,fipjrzg,t3_f5hnb3,1582609115.0,"Yo, that shit is called Manager Spark for a reason, IMO. I don’t mind doing it when asked, but without my TL login not signing me in to spark because I’m not an assistant, I think it’s best the managers take that on as a definite daily task. After all, it helps their bonus, not mine. 

I feel my department is on auto-pilot so when I get in in the morning I check in with my team and look over our FST for the day. I then go check on rotisserie, meat/deli/hms/FC then walk up to cafe to check on them. Make sure we have coverage and no gaps in the schedule for the day and if we do I start building a plan from there. 

Fresh leads at my club typically don’t do much outside of fresh in general. Although we are all hands on deck when needed, but most of the time staying in our areas isn’t hard to do. Occasionally I’ll go up and run the front if we are short on MSL’s or pull a few orders for CPU. If I’m in at 6am I try to make time to help stock an area that they primarily stock and maintain but it’s in my department so I try to take it off their hands for them."

CasualConversation,fftalne,t3_euy9ag,1580214541.0,"Maybe she has ADHD or something similar? It seems her mind as all this extra energy and talking is her release. Ask if she has considered speaking with her GP about this behavior, due to the fact that everyone else around her is able to talk AND get their work done. I also like the race idea that another person mentioned. I work as a supervisor in retail as well and deal with so many personalities it can be a bit overwhelming. I’ve learned that you can’t have just one style of “managing” for every associate, everyone requires different attention. Also, sometimes you have to put the fear of god in people too lol. When they think they are about to lose their jobs, they really think about their actions and I feel I see positive results almost instantaneously, if they care. If they don’t care it would be obvious after their work ethic doesn’t get any better or the problem continues. After that point it’s best to part ways with that person, after all, you’re trying to run a business and if they can’t keep up with the expectations why do you need to keep them around?"

There’s no book that’s going to tell you how to do it because it’s different for everyone. It sounds like you’ve already started! You said you’re in a better place financially, renting your own place, went on a vacation etc. you already are starting over! and the thing about that is that it won’t happen over night. Keep doing what you’re doing, you’re doing amazing. Find things/hobbies that make you happy and fit them into yoir routine. I’m a less physical person lol (no sports or going to the gym etc) but I found  a lot of joy from finding podcasts that touch on my general interests. It’s already great to listen and feel a connection to the speaker as well. Anyway, you’ve got this. If going back to school is something that you feel will ultimately bring you happiness (within a career) then keep that going! You’ve got it figured out, just sounds like anxiety to me, making you question and wanting validation."
