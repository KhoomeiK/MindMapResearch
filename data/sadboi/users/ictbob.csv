That was the breaking point but before that there were bad times. One morning she had decided to leave her phone recording audio and then took the dog for a walk. 
When she got back and listened to the recording somehow she got confused. 
There was me snoring from the bedroom (she was in the living room) then her getting something out of her purse and whispering something to the dog then her leaving and then coming back and truning off the recording. She thought the whispering was while she was gone somehow. But had to admit she was wrong after I pointed out you could clearly hear the dog walking on the wood floor after the whispering and that wasn't possible if she was with the dog outside. Did that stop her from screaming iny face that I was a fucking liar? Nope.
Am I a saint for this? No.
I am just a fool in love who refuses to blame her for the effects of a disease. Any more than I would get upset about her sneezing with a cold. It's not her fault.
But damn does it hurt."
lonely,fn9o1bc,t1_fn91b0b,1586779855.0,"She cheated on me. I forgave her almost immediately. But somehow she made me feel bad about it still. She made it seem like it was my fault she slept with someone else. Like my weakness cased it.
But there were so many other things. 
She would get so angry at me! For things she suspected I did but didn't do. 
I think she has serious OCD with paranoid fusions. 
I know it's not my fault but I feel horrible about blaming someone  with a horrible affliction like that also. So I take the blame. Just to make it work long enough for her to get help. 
I couldn't maintain it long enough. I broke."
