*However...*

When someone says something like that, just ask them if you would have to “prove” your diagnosis it if you had diabetes. What about heart disease. Is that something they could see or notice? How about thyroid issues: does someone who has an underactive thyroid seem ill? No. They may have had symptoms before getting diagnosed and starting medication, but if they’re following doctor’s orders they won’t seem ill, despite having a chronic condition."

It’s never too late."
BipolarReddit,fq6injc,t1_fq558db,1589132261.0,"I don’t think it’s the meds, because my lost memories aren’t all from when I’ve been on meds (and I’ve gone through a cocktail of different meds before I found the ones that work). They also aren’t all from when I’ve been off meds, and in fact my memory holes are worse the more ill I’ve been, whether that’s from being totally off my meds or on the wrong ones. 

The right meds + putting pictures and quotes from my kids on Facebook has let me remember the last 5-6 years better than any other period of my life. It sucks that I lost most of the babyhood years from my older kids, but I’ve at least got my youngest child’s first years to remember."
BipolarReddit,fq6hwrr,t1_fq5l7la,1589131849.0,I never thought that the blank spaces in my memory was from manic depression - in fact I thought everyone memories are like that. It was only after quite a few “do you remember when ____ happened” moments with my sister and family that I realized it. My go to answer is nodding and giving noncommittal or answers. e.g. my sister says “Do you remember when our cousin thought it was a good idea to light a dozen sparklers at the same time?” My answer is to shake my head and say that Cousin is an idiot.
BipolarReddit,fq4yvvh,t1_fq4phiu,1589087611.0,"It’s hard, I know. The main comfort I take is that I don’t remember what I don’t remember (if that makes sense). It’s only when I really think about it and try to look back, that I realize that I’ve lost big chunks of time. Most of the time, it’s just kind of a blurry fog behind me... except when I’m blindsided by a flashback. That part sucks. 

It does make me wonder, what neurotypical people’s memories are like. I have no reference, so it just seems totally alien. (Ironically, even though I can’t remember a lot of stuff from the past, my short and medium term memory is pretty good. I know the location of specific ingredients in the pantry. I know what odd place I hid the turkey roasting pan. I remember that we’re almost out of toothpaste. But hell if I know what we did for my birthday 3 years ago, or if we went on vacation when my kids were really little."
BipolarReddit,fq3pbcp,t3_ggo8s8,1589068691.0,"Nobody ever talks about broken memories. I have entire years that are just... gone. I’ve lost most of my memories from 20-26, with the exception of some really nasty stuff that’s pretty much given me PTSD symptoms (and can and do trigger flight/fight/freeze responses that are so bad that I’m wrecked for at least a day or two afterwards). 

So many many times someone will mention something that’s happened, and I just plain don’t remember it. It’s like hearing someone else’s story for the first time - the memory is just gone. Unless it’s one of the events that broke me a bit. That shit stuck. My eldest kid’s first birthday? Gone. Remembering the last time I saw my grandpa? Not there. Birthdays, family parties, holidays, baptisms... all gone. The last time I completely had a psychotic break from spinning into mania for too long? Yeah. That’s still there."

We now have HR outsourced, so disclosing it wouldn’t be as bad.

breakingmom,ffueuwr,t1_fftm8uy,1580240482.0,"Companies have EPLI (employment practices liability insurance) for a reason. Find a lawyer with experience in discrimination in the workplace and tell them you’re being pushed out because of: a) age, b) the supervisor has a history of sleeping with his (young) subordinates, c) there is a special needs child that needs transportation to their school at a certain time, and d) the change in schedule is arbitrary and for no other reason than to get you to quit/be fired.

And that’s fine, because there are medications to help that. Just like someone whose pancreas doesn’t make insulin has to take meds, or another person who’s thyroid is a slacker, or yet another person who has blood pressure that need help. It’s just medicine to make our bodies work better. Is it a bit annoying to have to take meds? Yeah, but what’s the alternative? I know I don’t want to go back to that. 

So what is “normal”?  Normal is taking care of ourselves, and whatever that entails, whether it’s meds, or therapy, or exercising, or eating food that makes our bodies healthy and happy."

bipolar,fe8tpor,t1_fe6itbo,1578930724.0,"The others have a lot of good tips. 

My one best tip is to come up with a daily schedule that includes a set time for studying. Even if you don’t have any homework that is due, use that time to read your notes, re-read your textbooks, or practice skills that you’re learning. For me, I studied every night from 9:00-12:00 on the days I wasn’t working (I worked 2 nights a week tending bar). By having that set schedule, I developed a habit of studying and was able to keep on top of my classes. It’s way too easy to let things start to slide if I’m not scheduling myself, and then it gets overwhelming."
