WhitePeopleTwitter,fpmnz8k,t1_fpmlsff,1588737345.0,"I have an ex whose stalked, harassed and threatened not only me and almost all of my friends, has made it a point to me that she’s going to ruin my life.

She told me when I left that if I did, she’d make sure I’d never become a doctor (I’m trying to get into med school). 

I get a call from a detective like a month ago saying she’s made allegations against me (mind you I have a restraining order on her). I tell the detective that I haven’t spoken to her in almost a year and I don’t want anything to do with her.

Turns out she’s making rape allegations and she even called me (the day after my restraining order ended) to try to get me to confess to something I didn’t do. 

She’s really pretty so almost every guy she tells her story to believes her to try and white knight and I hate to think that “allegations” alone would be enough to ruin years of work I’ve put into getting where I am now. So thank you for this.

depression,fn3o3na,t1_fn3h76a,1586624594.0,"Well if you go into it with the preconceived notion that everyone is out to hurt you or abuse you than I can see that train of thought and I can’t blame your for thinking that cause I used to think the same thing.

But it’s a stuck point, it’s an extreme thought that I manufactured in my head and fed based off experiences that I had gone through and projected into objective reality. Life is never black or white.

So a couple of things, 1. I wouldn’t seek help from abusive people period. I’ve had enough of that to last me a lifetime and it can be hard to recognize it sometimes but that just comes with experience.


2. I wouldn’t go to someone that hates me to help me, I’d go to someone I know cares and is willing to listen to me and vent, it doesn’t always require feedback. These are the people I’m talking about because they do care and they hate to see us like that and don’t have all the tools that a good and right therapist would have to be able to help in a complete way.

3.again I wouldn’t go to someone that hates me, and if I go to someone that cares for me I’d make sure communicate what it is I’m looking for. Like hey can I just vent to you, or hey can you give me some advice, and a good friend will ask you if it’s just an ear to listen to or advice that you’re looking for

4. My first therapist wasn’t bad but she helped in a minor way, my second therapist was honestly ass and he didn’t help me at all, but my third therapist was a godsend. She was patient with me and understanding but at the same time called me on my bullshit in a way that registered with me. So yeah maybe I can go into it with the mindset that there’s a lot of garbage people that are therapists or I can go into it with the realistic mindset of therapist are human beings just like me so they come in a mixed bag so its up to me if I wanna get better to find one that works for me.

I’m not trying to sound confrontational or anything like that but I’m coming from a place of where our circumstances might not be the same but those feelings are what I can understand and relate to."

So maybe context also really matters too, I can see how it can be used as something negative. That being said I’m not talking about trash people. I’m talking in the context of someone who’s trying to help you and doesn’t really know how to help, which is what therapist are for.

Other times it hurt me a lot lmao but I’d rather do it than be left wondering what if.

Some of my FWB have become my closest friends, got all the physical stuff out of our way and realized that we just weren’t compatible with each other even if the sex was good. We’ll be happy for each other when we find good partners and it’s all platonic now. Others I don’t ever speak to anymore.

ptsd,fmezhgt,t3_furktw,1586016857.0,"I suffer from PTSD too, from two different lasting events. One being from a prolonged abusive relationship  and it honestly kept me from having a healthy relationship until I started a deep CPT therapy over the summer and it helped a lot! 

That being said it’s never completely gone, I’m just more aware of the symptoms when they come and I’m better prepared to handle them but I don’t always win those fights. Sometimes i lose and sometimes I think it’s better that I just never do another relationship because I can lash out and lose my head because of it but I’m lucky to have someone who knows the my history and is patient with me.

For the most part I’m good tho, and I think it’s all about upkeep, when I start to fall back into it and get bad again i know it’s Because I’m falling behind on upkeep. Things like meditation, journaling, writing about stuckpoints and breaking those apart in paper as they come is what keeps me healthy. 

Just have to think of it as exercise for your brain, when you stop you can still live but I’ll come at a cost so it’s better to maintain some kind of mental health routine to help keep you happy and healthy just like any other part of your body and those lows and struggles will come less often and less severely."

It feels like I went into that relationship one person and came out out of it another, like I completely lost myself. I’ve done a lot of work and I feel better overall. It’s only when she pries into my life that it all comes spiraling down on me again. With the tools therapy gave me I pick myself up faster but it still drops me to the same low and and that’s what upsets me. It’s almost as she knows I hate myself for the mistakes I made and knows it tortures me when she made them too and back when we were still able to talk and I’d speak about what happened she’d go into a frenzy and start calling me a liar and say it was all my fault and all my doing.

Like it feels like she tapped into Pandora’s box in me and I’m all to aware of it and the things I’ve done terrified of the things I’ve been capable of. That’s not who I am and not who I wanna be. I always gave her the benefit of the doubt, she’s sick, she had a rough life, she needs help but in her reality I’m just a monster and projects that so strongly on my that I start to believe it."

It was pretty much a whole summer of CPT therapy and it was the hardest summer of my life but it helped so much when it came to me being by myself as an individual but it’s when I get into relationships is when I face those road bumps. It’s similar feelings, occasions, places etc that take me back into old memories that is the hard part. I appreciate my girlfriend so much because she’ll notice it in me before I fully understand what’s happening to me and she’ll talk to me. 

It’s like I have a better idea of what I don’t want out of a relationship and what I don’t wanna be like than what I do want. I try to be conscious of my own red flags and toxic thoughts and potential behaviors and try to handle those on my own before ever letting them take life. 

There are a lot of things I did in my old relationship that I wish I hadn’t and I take responsibility for those and I still carry that guilt but it was all reactive rather than things what I wanted to do, it’s no excuse but I know I never want to let those things happen to me again and never react like that again. 

But my abusive ex pops in about once a year and attacks my home, stalks my friends, makes allegations about me despite me having a restraining order on her and it sends my brain into a spiral.

AskMen,fcodgtc,t3_ei2kov,1577829552.0,"I didn’t realize it shouldn’t have been like that till a year and another failed relationship later. I was having a hard time in a new relationship cause I was dealing with the traumas by my abusive one. It took a lot of therapy, specifically Cognitive Processing Therapy and time to sort it all out and I’m still sorting it out to be honest.

My final straw was when I went to a birthday party for my friend where we went to play laser tag, completely sober and no hard partying involved. My ex was convinced that something was going on between me and my friends sister who I’ve been platonic friends with for years. The sister posted a picture of her playing laser tag and my ex immediately messaged her asking why she was playing laser tag with her boyfriend(me).

She began blowing up everyone’s phones and Harrasing them. She started to call my phone over and over again and this wasn’t uncommon and I was frustrated so I turned it off. 

When I got home (she would stay with me from time to time) I turned on my phone and had a ton of messages and missed calls from her starting off violent then proceeding to apologetic and talk of suicide.

She had done this before as well and I was kind of used to it (not okay I realize now) but when I walked into my bathroom hair and blood covered the floor. 

Sh was walking in with slit and bloodied wrist  and chopped hair and it honestly broke me. I was angry and it dissolved in an instant. We agreed that if she went to the hospital in the morning I wouldn’t call the police.

I had been baker acted before and I didn’t want that for her and it scared her too.

It was a mistake on my part.

I tried to break up with her in the morning cause Our relationship was destroying both of us. She attacked me, and I defended myself and restrained her and let her go. She fell back hit a step on the floor and busted her chin.

She sat there talking about how she was going to kill me and annoying that got between us. I recorded it to help me if I needed it.

She held this over my head for a week. Telling me if I didn’t stay with her, she would tell the police I beat her. Which after a week of her making more aggressive demands I got fed up and broke things off.

She went to the police and I was arrested the next day. I fought tooth and nail and it broke me financially but with my evidence and the help of my lawyer. I came out clean minus the arrest history.

Funny thing is, she asked me for a kiss before she went to the police. I laughed it off. The whole thing was insane.

She still scares the shit out of me. She could come at me with a knife and I’d be scared to defend myself. Damned if I do, damned if I don’t."

i stuck to women i knew were bad for me, Kind of like dealing with the devil you know rather the one you don't.

I can expect alot of shit from a person with red flags so it wont shock me but when a person i perceive to be good or decent, hurts me like that it caught me off guard and hurt that much more.

therapy helped alot with this. i still have that attraction but i TRY to be smarter but sometimes ill dip my toe into that water occasionally but i don't invest myself into those red flagged people. its a process but you're not alone."

I’m also attracted to people who not only look like her but also display the same red flags she did but I was too love blind to acknowledge back then.

I’ve talked to my therapist about it and it might be my need for control, almost like wanting to stick myself into the same situation and re live it and change the outcome.

But I totally understand this feeling of being attracted to people that look like them. Maybe it is the combination of violence and sex that makes it such a strong attraction? I’m not sure"

Veterans,f6t56bv,t3_dsqve4,1573144161.0,"I was in your shoes and while I knew what I wanted to go to school for and really wanted to try here’s some tips that I picked up. Keep in mind that I graduated HS with like 2.3gpa and I have a 3.7 as a junior at university and these things helped me a lot.

1. Start at a community college, it’s better if you build a good foundation with prep courses they might offer than jumping into something you haven’t do in years. They offer smaller classes and introduction classes to help get your feet wet and into the rhythm of things.

2. Visit your professors office hours if you need help, they’re usually pretty nice and will be happy to help and I usually asked questions there that I didn’t wanna ask in class in fear of sounding dumb and clears up a lot of confusion.

3. Surround yourself with people way smarter than you. It’s contagious, you’ll wanna catch up and compete, and they’ll help you pick up good study habits and techniques. Sometimes they’ll explain things in ways the teacher doesn’t and this will help you learn material too. (Also try to explain what your learning to others and this has helped me more than anything else)

4. Treat it like a job. You’re getting paid for it so don’t look at it like school and look at it like a job because if you’re full time and once you get into heavier material it pretty much will be a full time job so treat it as such. Don’t put off HW and studying and make sure you dedicate a certain amount of time to it everyday. It’s better to give too much time at first to help you get into a groove that works for you, so yes everyday.

4. Be proactive! Honestly school is not that hard, life while going to school is what’s hard. So be proactive and get things done as soon as they’re given to you or work on them as soon as you can before it can pile up on you and have life slap you in the face and make getting all the stacked up work 10x harder to finish than it really is.

5. Learning some things is hard but nothing is impossible! Take time to study, ask for help, watch videos on YouTube. There’s no reason you’re not understanding material if you’re effectively studying and putting in the effort and time. It’ll come to you eventually as long as you keep pushing. But you’re not in the military anymore! So work harder AND smarter now lol instead of just harder not smarter. Take your work ethic and combine it with your new found freedom to think outside the box and you’ll do great.

Nothing inspires me more than watching my fellow vets killing it in school and life. So don’t do it just for yourself but also for your boys. Show them it can be done by doing it yourself. Good luck! You got this!"
ptsd,f6t1v6i,t3_dsw9c7,1573142824.0,"I’ve felt like this a lot, I think I hit #7 a year ago and I drank myself into oblivion.

My only advice is to hold on for dear life. Even if it hurts, even if it’s torture, hold on. I still struggle most days and I’m still waiting for things to really pick up but I have to wait and see if it does.

Quitting this game is something I can do at anytime if I really can’t stand it anymore but getting back in is something I can’t once I do.

Just hold on."
