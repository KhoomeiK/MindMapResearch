depression,fg7864x,t1_fg76hgq,1580586256.0,"Thanks for taking the time to respond.  I just am in a crazy situation and am having such a hard time coping. I'm being shunned by my parents and family and friends because I dont believe in their religion anymore. So I am alone I'm totally isolated, a stay at home mom  ... over 30 with 2 kids and a husband that yells at me and has taken me off our bank account so I have no access to money. Anything that he doesn't like he throws away so I have to hide things.... like I bought some tarrot cards just for fun. He found them and threw them out. If he catches me watching anything against the religion I get scolded. 

I have adhd and have a hard time keeping up with everything so he is constantly implying how I dont care enough about the kids or how I  just need to do things because I have no choice. He communicates with my parents on my behalf since they aren't talking to me. Just to see when they can watch the kids and stuff. And if he doesnt think I deserve a break he gives me an attitude about trying to contact them for help. He doesnt want to help he just wants to work and come home and do nothing. 

I get dark and try to reach out to friends I had over 10yrs ago but they're all busy and dont have time for me. It's no ones fault they dont I guess.... I just am so  ALONE.  I have no one to laugh with or do fun things with. I am only a mom. My husband and i are on the verge of divorce. We are in different rooms. But he says he's staying because of the kids and if we were going to divorce it would be because i chose to leave them. He includes the kids with him. Even though I know I'm not leaving my kids somewhere deep inside that thought has been planted and makes me question should I take the first step.  I also have no one to help me leave. I'm scared. I will have no health insurance and there are monthly medications I have to take... like thyroid medications. I feel like I'm in isolation and I think that's where all this comes from.

I just want a friend. I just want someone to hang out with. I'm sorry idk the point of this. I maybe just going crazy....."

Psychic,fd5e54d,t3_ek3dzw,1578176777.0,"Ok so I keep drawing this. The first one was an ""automatic drawing"" where I was asking for guidance on the path I should take to get to where I want to be. I closed my eyes and meditated and came up with a stick kinda version of the smaller bottom one... I cleaned it up and defined what some of the things were and filled in to show the tree and path and I tried to draw trees on the other side but it felt wrong and I just couldn't do it.... that was like a week ago
... 

So today a week later I'm taking a break hanging out with my 2 year old watching YouTube and wanted to practice drawing... I decided to just kinda draw from something in my mind when several of my reference drawings weren't inspiring me... so I saw this scene and i started drawing it... and after a little while i realized it was a lot like the automatic pic drawing <I saw no scene for that one>... now I'm wondering wait this means something... I'm not sure what it means.... here's what I know about what I'm drawing from the scene I had in my head..  i have trouble holding onto the image but...

It's like trees on one side of the path in the distance and then on the other side grass ... and it is kinda got a yellow hue from the reflection of the sun on part of the grass... the trees also feel happy... not like a sinister forest but like serene and bright
... there is grass also in front of the trees... they are in the distance... and there is a path... I cant clearly see what the path is made of.... idk if it's just worn down ground or a built path...


I didnt know if this could be symbolic or if maybe it's something I might see somewhere that will actually tell me something... like a painting hanging somewhere.... 


Any insight would be great"

I have audio recordings of his mental abuse. 
      I am acting out like a child because I am being put in the position of a child... he treats me as a teenager or an unequal adult. The story sounds odd because there is a lot more but I only felt like sharing that much of myself. I have a child school age but the other is not ... finding adequate affordable child care is a problem.  I'm really in a tight spot. I'm tracked on my phone when I leave the house... and before 2 days ago i cant remember the last time I left the house.... when you have no access to money and your money is being controlled it is really hard to get out."

The Knight of Cups is the card that symbolizes romance. It symbolizes your knight in shining armor. It symbolizes imagination. It represents creativity and new opportunities, and arrivals and proposals. ... The Knight of Cups speaks of being in touch with your emotions and your intuition.

The Hierophant is all about commitment. ... If you are asking about your love life the Hierophant speaks of a commitment that will make you feel secure. The Hierophant signifies the type of relationship where two people meet to discover who they really are.

The Ace of Pentacles indicates solidity in relationships, especially for new relationships. The Ace of Pentacles is a good sign because it tells you that where you are in love right now is exactly where you need to be. It also indicates a sense of healthy independence between you and your partner.

The appearance of the Hanged Man in your reading suggests making a sacrifice or giving up something that is precious to you.


Maybe it means I get to be happy with the person I want but I am going to have to sacrifice something to get there? Like leave a current relationship to be with the knight?"
