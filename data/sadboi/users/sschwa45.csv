I used to be very out of touch with myself and never considered going down on a girl as something that I would be into. That is until I had a dream about going down on a girl and it was awesome. When the actual act happened it took like a month or two for me to start loving it because at first I had no idea what I was doing.

Another thing to consider is that many women still are uncomfortable with the idea of anyone going down on them because it’s extremely personal. Like I’ve heard women say “ew” when someone shares their bf when down on them last night. Maybe it’s related. Good luck!"

All these scenarios makes all of our blood boil. It fucking sucks. 

I disagree on one point. We do need to believe people in general when they come forward. From my personal experience (and I’m sure yours) taking abuse public or going to the police is NOT fun and usually results in us being beaten down even further. Statistically people who lie about sexual assault are no more abundant than those who lie about crimes in any other category. The idea that people lie about assault all the time really only helps the abusers get away with it. I don’t know if that will change your view or not.

I don’t know what your personal experience with the judicial system is, but I’m letting you know right now it’s not a good indicator if someone’s a rapist or not. Out of the tiny percentage of people who actually report only 8% lead to a summons and less to trial.

Part of the reason people are so fed up with Kobe in particular is because he used an aggressive victim shaming defense and her identity was “leaked” multiple times causing death threats. She didn’t stand trial because his counsel was dirty and trying to publicly attack her character as a slut and she couldn’t take it. Anyone who has been raped knows that’s the number one reason people don’t speak up. Better to stay quiet than to be publicly shamed.

His defense was so upsetting that the state of Colorado changed its laws to prevent something like that happening again to people who come forward.

We also can’t assume that Kobe only raped once and changed his ways after being reported. An overwhelming majority of survivors don’t report and he is quoted saying how he should have paid off his accuser to be quiet. People who rape don’t just have one-and-dones. Being capable of rape suggests a lack of empathy and the ability to do it more than once. It’s not uncommon for rapists to have charisma, charm, and popularity.

abuse,fffnz7y,t3_etbejq,1579888050.0,"I thank you for sharing your story and sympathize with the things we must unlearn when being abused at a young age, but I don’t like that you’re keeping this a secret. How are your siblings doing? Have you made amends? Have you apologized? Keeping it a secret hurts everyone including yourself. One of the healing mantras of CSA survivors is “no more secrets.” My brother will never admit what he did to me, and for that he is a piece of shit. The validation your siblings would receive from your heartfelt confession / apology can start their healing. It’s a gift to give, even if you never got that from your cousins. If they hate you that is something you must accept. It could also jumpstart your own healing because keeping it inside is only eating you alive."

PresidentialRaceMemes,feul1in,t1_fetwdmj,1579387560.0,Came here to say this. I’m gay af. If he’s not comfortable standing up to the media over a single pole in a gay bar (which is extremely common) he’s not the right pioneer for me. People who fought back during the Stonewall Riots were brave. Someone who shies away from a single stripper pole in fear of the corporate media is not brave.
PresidentialRaceMemes,feugssq,t1_fetcnsp,1579386431.0,"My mom who was upset when I came out as a lesbian said this. I promise you this is not the case.

Also can black people not like a candidate based on policies and record? Like, are they not afforded that choice? Or do they have to be collectively homophobic or sexist if they don’t support a candidate that we think works for them...?"
PresidentialRaceMemes,fepvcyq,t1_feputve,1579332637.0,"Damn good catch. Fuck they really hid that and I read the whole transcript earlier today. Like, I know multiple other people thought of the same buzzfeed article thinking he came off as disingenuous."
BikiniBottomTwitter,feni1xf,t1_femun2v,1579285142.0,"I think that instead sparks a question on how to get kids engaged in learning. It’s probably the biggest question in pedagogy. And not to mention there has been a lot of literature about how math and science are taught from the bottom up when many people learn abstractly or prefer to start somewhere in the middle or from the top down. The same goes for music. You could bore someone trying to get them to memorize how to sight read single notes, but if you show them the simple chords of / how to play a song they of their choosing you could start theory there. There’s is no huge sacrifice in changing the approach to keep children engaged if the end goal is the same."
menitrust,fejqt5s,t3_epesq0,1579183527.0,It’s funny cause the band purposely chose the name Men I Trust because they wanted it to be something positive
PublicFreakout,fehb4hw,t1_feg3kk7,1579112915.0,Yeah can we talk about the fact that a child has to fear being shot in the first place because he has a toy?
