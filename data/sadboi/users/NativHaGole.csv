The whole point of depression is that it's an illness, the point that there is no coherence between reality and your brain's reaction.
If something bad happen to you and you feel sad it's a normal reaction. People can get depressed after something bad happened, but that's another story.

As you said, bad relationships, let people abuse and use you, refuse to study or do things for your own sake, don't let people in etc. ect.

For many people the physical pain is channeling the emotional one. For me, the only time i did it (hand in the oven, yay) was kind of surreal, i was so cut out of reality, didn't know how i feel or what to do with myself and just wanted to do something bad.

I think these subconscious ones are sometimes even more dangerous, because some people don't even realize they do it. Or they do, but can't control themselves, just like with cutting.
I also think emotional wounds are much harder to heal, and that most of the damage the comes from cutting is fhe emotional one and not the physical."

I also would like to say that feeling unsure and scared about the future is pretty natural on this situation even without depression. maybe trying to have some distraction is good for now. Maybe hang out with your friend and do something fun without talking about how shitty life is :P

telling people they just want to be the victim, or feeling sorry for themselves or any other way to blame them for their condition is really hurtful to anybody. on top of that many people with mental illness already blame themselves, thinking ""other people got it for real, i'm just whining"" etc. and it just make their condition worse and prevent them from getting an actual treatment (like therapy and meds).

Look, i think the main problem with most of these suggestions is that they start with ""it's simple"" ""just"" ""ALL you have to do is.."" etc. But the thing is when you feeling really bad, when someone tells you ""sports are good for you! it's helps feeling better!"" it's like saying, ""oh you broke your hand? why didn't you put ice on it?"". It really belittle your problems, which are completely real. one of the symptoms of depression is not wanting to do things that are good for you. also even if an exercise will actually help for an hour (when i was at my worst days it surely didn't) it can't solve the problem. 

Of course exercise is good, but you can do it only after you come to the point when you are able to do things that are good for you, and not in order to fix those problems. the same goes with hydration.

It always feels like there is no way to sovle this, i think everybody that seeks help feel this way, but it's not true. It's also the depression that makes you feel hopeless. It's not going to be easy, and not immediate but it can happen. 

You want to live, and live well, and i think you are on the right track to get there :)"
depression,eykn007,t1_eyklkg9,1567160390.0,"can i do <3 without it'll be too kitsch? :P

anyway...my ""true self"" is being passionate and curious and friendly. I love people and my intellectual abilities are really main part of my personality. My dream is to be a physician. i want to go protest (we have things to protest about here haha) or volunteer. I want to do something significant in the world, research or i don't what... so many things. But well, all these things just feel so far, just ""theoretical"". I'm asking myself am i really this person? can't imagine having the drive to do things. i feel like my formative years were painted by depression. i can't even finish first degree (in my country i'm not THAT old for doing so, but for now it doesn't seem to go anywhere.) 

and then i think to myself, even if some meds and therapy will some day finally make me feel better, will i be this person, or my brain is just too broken?  
i can't imagine wanting to live. I'm not talking about being alive, i'm talking about wanting to do things, to be who i am.  So yea... existential crises. 

My Therapist said that the lack of will is the depression, but i just feel these ""cancerous cells"" are so embedded in my cells that i'll never be able to separate them. 

I don't know how it sounds, i don't feel this ""great person"" i want to be, maybe it's just stupid fantasy.  
Edit: I feel like i'm going to be nothing, and i don't want to live this way. 
I'm also not sure how i feel about what i wrote here, but well, this is what there is haha. 

thanks for wanting to hear me out :)"

And also yea, sometimes it just hit me how sick i am.  When therapist/psychiatist start mentioning ECT
And i can't finish my degree, or work... lately it hits hard then ever."
depression,eykl8iy,t3_cx4pt9,1567157777.0,"Oh so many answers.
I'm 27 and got thing to share, but it'll probably get lost in here.

So i'll just say - funny, i just talked about it with my therapist yesterday."
depression,eyblaw8,t3_cwfagx,1566987044.0,"And it's really ok to do so.

Even though crying doesn't make me feel better most of the times. it's not the kind of crying that gives you relife, it's depression spilling out of me."
