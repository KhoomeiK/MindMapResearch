That seems like an extremely irresponsible and dangerous decision made by a mental health professional what the fuck.... Suddenly losing meds could potentially kill someone like not to sound dramatic....idk I've cold turkeyed my meds, more than once, and it was super fucked I super almost died (because I went nuts and was gonna either kill myself or get myself killed) Even far off that scale being in a situation where meds are suddenly lost could likely ruin their life. This makes me really sad dude. Like I'm sorry. That being said I found myself out of state once and the state like couldn't take other state's prescriptions idk some dumb bullshit so I couldn't get my meds.

I'd roll out of bed 10 minutes before work every day and if I was off some days I'd sleep til like 4pm if I could. I got off that shit and woke up in the morning with time to take a shower before work for literally the first time in a year, that shit killed me. I was on 5mg a night. Oh and I gained like 20lbs.

BipolarReddit,ff0jyzp,t3_eqytad,1579469549.0,My outpatient after being released was not helpful either. I didn't really have any support my family acted like it was an accident and didn't even acknowledge that it happened at all when I was out.

BipolarReddit,fexuygr,t3_eqtp1r,1579436922.0,Don't give up yet it takes time to get used to meds because the results aren't instant like a diabetic takes insulin and their sugar level is normal right away or how ever insulin works idk. And there is no way to like test if the meds you're on are actually working for you like a blood test or some shit idk I'm not a doctor but it takes some trial and error to find the meds that will work for you and the only way you can know if they're right is if you don't give up keep taking them and wait to see if you feel better. If you still feel like this after like a month tell your doctor and try something else. It took me a couple tries to get there and my doctor told me that it's not so common to get it right the first time. And I was super frustrated and confused because it was already hard enough to even consider meds let alone go find a doctor to get some so when I finally did it and they didn't just fix me right then and there I felt pretty hopeless and I gave up a few times. It's tough to stick with it but it's worth it.

Who even actually is anyways, mental health issues or not, no one's life is perfect. I've always thought mines so fucked up I'll never have a normal life but I don't really know what it means to have a normal life and I don't know if anyone actually has one. So I stopped striving for the perfect life where I function 100% all the time and I'm just as good as everyone else with good old workin brains and decided whatever I have a normal enough life for me and true enough stability for me. It helped me stop beating myself up and being scared that I'm not actually better because what if I'm not as stable as that person.

Bipolar_ADHD,fexh0si,t3_e5plga,1579430861.0,"I've never had a routine by myself before either and reading this I just realized that yeah the only time I have ever had a routine was when I was institutionalized.
I'm not as bad as I was but after a few years and med changes I at least have a stable home and job for the first time. Once I got that I guess in order I decided to take a break off from drinking cause since my last major break down and hospitalization I hadn't gone probably 3 days without alcohol. but yeah I took a break from that and fucking lost my everloving mind but my point is after I struggled through that I decided with a clear head that I needed a routine and decided what kind of stuff I want to have in that routine so I can keep my job and like not die. It might sound dumb but I stayed up all night and downloaded a bunch of apps for shit like this. I have a goals app that reminds me everyday to have breakfast before work and like do Tai Chi after work and it reminds me to actually eat and stuff and eat around the same time every day. Then I got this mood recorder thing that makes me tell it if I'm ok or not. And a meditation one that dings at night and reminds me to go to bed and helps me relax and actually go to bed. And a calendar too. I'm just pulling strings but I've been to work on time almost everyday this week and I feel a little better. Just trying to do at least one thing every day at the same time was a good start for me."

Like my employer didn't just not fire me, they told me I was doing a good job. That had never happened to me in my life! Oh and side note I got a raise? Wtf is a raise? Now two years later I'm at the same job, I just got an amazing promotion and I have benefits. I didn't even know this was possible. 
I often reflect on my past and it's seriously not great, but I do feel like I lost a piece of myself. My ""spunk"" or my ""free spirit"" honestly it wasn't a fun carefree lifestyle it was messy and disfunctional  but I miss myself sometimes so I'm trying to get the good from the past to mix with the great that I have now so that my ""old"" self and my ""new"" self can be friends."

That and sometimes when I tell people that I have Adderall, well one the fucking vultures just flock like I'm some sort of candy store but that's a whole different rant, but two I'm like embarrassed to tell people that I take Adderall all the time. And some people that do end up finding out, if I show even the slightest infliction of happiness or if I speak for one second too long they're like ""jeeze how much Adderall did you take today!?""

adderall,fex2l3b,t3_epxyec,1579423269.0,"Omg. I semi recently moved too and I WAS TERRIFIED of finding a new doctor. I worked soooo hard for so long to finally get on track with meds and doses that helped me and thinking that my new doctor would decide that I was full of shit and just trying to get pills was a hardcore fear I faced. But he didn't do that! Because people fuck with Adderall so much it makes sense to think a doctor would be weary and judgemental...but after spending time getting to know my new doctor I kind of realized they know their shit and I'm sure they can tell probably real quick if someone is full of shit. Plus it never dawned on me that we would ask for my old doctor's number (then I  was like duh your new doctor would want your medical records) That felt like I had proof or back up. I dunno, it took me a long, long time to go into a psychiatrist's office with the mindset that they are there to help... I felt like I was handcuffed, sitting under an interrogation lamp every time. Eventually that mindset changed for me and now because I'm NOT afraid of being completely rejected I find it easier to open up which in turn made me more honest. They're not gonna tell you you're wrong if you tell them how you feel. Now I'm completely open with my current doctor and we actually worked out some really productive changes to my meds and I'm fucking on track, full blown stable and healthy. But that was me, maybe I just got super lucky and found two super empathetic and genuine doctors I'm sure some are huge dicks and chose not to see their patient's feelings as what they really are. I super hope finding a new doctor worked out for you!"

I've wondered if other people have experienced this possible side effect too."
