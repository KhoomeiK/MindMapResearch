addiction,fng4guv,t3_g1fu29,1586922101.0,Hey my first hand advice is take it on days you really need it and not to take it everyday or just because. If you can not take it and still function and get all your shit done without taking it then don’t take it. Maybe take it once or twice a week and see how you feel. You should journal all of feelings and things you notice to help you remember. I find the longer I go without taking one then I take one and it really really helps the way I need it to . I am prescribed 10mg non extended and sometimes usually just do half. Everyone reacts differently . One thing that I always remind myself is that adderall is one chemical component away from meth . One chemical component away from meth.. do I really need this?
addiction,fn6djrg,t1_fn1l3or,1586696275.0,If may be your reaction but you do not have to identify as the reaction. You are to observe it passing like storm clouds out your window on a rainy day <3

addiction,fmdm31w,t3_fuhn1t,1585971362.0," Sugar addiction is real and I know this first hand . I’ve researched it a lot and had done a project on it before. It affects your brain the same way cocaine does and has many side effects. It is as addicting as cocaine and a very misunderstood and socially acceptable addiction . I also suffered a cocaine addiction which isn’t socially acceptable . To mention, I live a alcohol free lifestyle (been 1year plus boozeless) which as you know it’s really just sugar too. Sugar is tough as fuck I still struggle with it but I work with it though a healthy diet , so much water , I aim to drink a gallon a day , exercise yoga and meditation . When I was really bad with sugar I would find journaling extremely helpful and then going back to them as reminders as to how awful I felt after that binge. I still consume sugar I just currently have a balanced relationship with it . Life is about creating a balance and working to maintain the balance. You are amazing and you will gain control over your sugar addiction . It’s is something you will learn to live with and manage but you are not alone. Your potential is limitless. Positive self talk and affirmations are your best tool. If you need anything feel free to reach out ."

They have a lot more than pizza it’s really good , the pasta and pizza dough is all made in-house and the sandwiches at lunch not many people know about are great. The fix has bomb burgers, I like it there too!Lastly, I find it amusing hearing people real about Kelly square. I just don’t mind it because I go through it so much but key is to make Kelly square your bitch and drive through it like you run it lol. Every man for himself!! Haha"

Please be easy on yourself , sometimes trying to do everything at once is too much and sets you up for failure. You will get to where you wanna be and it’s obvious you have have the attitude for it. Getting off the harder substances and booze is so much more important then having a little weed.  A little bit of weed might help you and then cut that when you are stronger. Everyone has to approach sobriety in their own way, there is no right or wrong to how you get there. Be easy on yourself, stay in your day , and use positive self talk to build yourself up.

What might be helpful to becoming more submissive is getting rewarded and praise for it. You must first have a conversation about this he knows why he is to call you a good girl and compliment you. You will appreciate and want more of his admiration and want to keep being submissive for him. I know it’s hard to not be a total brat all the time but I’m sure you  will have just as much fun being a ‘good’ brat."
