Königwesen Sinistea

HP: 45

Attack:60

Defence: 103

Sp.Atk: 30

Sp.Def: 60

Speed: 10

Type: Steel/Ghost

Ability: Shell Armor/Shining Armor (New Ability)

The Sinistea that inhabited the Pitch Black Forest and Enchanted Grove were frequently getting into fights with each other and other Pokemon and because of this their cups and tea pots that they inhabited ended up getting chipped and damaged. Eventually, they started to inhabit the worn helmets of knights who died long ago in the Great Kalos War. While this made them much more resistant to attacks and made them more adept at physical attacks it also made them much more slow and it also drastically reduced their Sp.Atk.

Königwesen Sinistea evolves into Königwesen Polteagiest when you interact with a Ruined Set of Armor which is a decoration which can be found in a few routes that is similar to the Ice and Moss Rock. These would be in the late routes and victory road.

Königwesen Polteagiest

HP: 58

Attack: 96

Defence: 168

Sp.Atk: 46

Sp.Def: 112

Speed: 28

Type: Steel/Ghost

Abilities: Shell Armor/ Shining Armor

The Königwesen Sinistea that became alphas of their regiment would then inhabit a suit of armor and become a Königwesen Polteagiest. This makes them extremely durable and resilient to attacks and they are often used as body guards due to their immense defense. They have even higher defense and special defense than Königwesen Sinistea however it still has fairly low offences and abysmal speed.

Königwesen Sinistea and Polteagiest would have a mainly support move pool with moves like Will-o-wisp, Iron defense, Shadow Punch, Iron Head, Beat Up, Shell Smash, Nuzzle, Clear Smog, Hex, Ally Switch, Reflect, Ingrain, Trick Room, Curse and it's signature move Spiritual Strengthen.

Signature Ability and Move

Shining Armor:

Any stat changes that this Pokemon experiences are kept when switched out (e.g Intimidate or Iron Defense) however are still wiped by moves like Clear Smog and Haze.

Spiritual Strengthen:

This Pokemon for the next 8 turns takes 25% less damages from physical attacks.

Hope you like my regional form i think next I'm doing Königwesen Durant and Arrant and also Königwesen Heatmor and Eismortor. Is there anything i did badly that i could improve? Thanks"

Atall

HP: 30

Attack: 45

Defence: 32

Sp.Atk: 88

Sp.Def: 62

Speed: 70

Total: 327

Type: Psychic

Ability: Aftermath/ Extremely Explosive

Atalls are rather small and nimble Pokemon who launch their orbs that orbit their bodies at foes. They feed off nuclear radiation and gather around extremely polluted areas and can gradually help reduce the radiation. They are usually quite friendly albeit mischievous however they can be quite volatile and has been known to launch its orbs at people or Pokemon who irritate it and it can cause serious burns. This Pokemon is based of a hydrogen atom,  bowling, I based the hair off Albert Einstein's hair and the name is a combination of ""Atom"" and ""Ball"" and it also sounds like Atoll which is a ring shaped reef that was a common target for nuclear tests.

Plutowl

HP: 58

Attack: 93

Defence: 48

Sp.Atk: 142

Sp.Def: 48

Speed: 102

Total: 491

Type: Psychic/Poison

Ability: Aftermath/ Extremely Explosive

Plutowls are a bit larger and strike their opponents with their bowling balls which can cause serious burns and knock back and stun their foes. They can usually be found guarding Atalls and are also known to experiment with objects they find in the wild, usually by smashing them together. They are highly unpredictable and crazy Pokemon but are still usually kind and protective to most Pokemon and trainers. This pokemon is based of a plutonium atom, bowling, I based the hair off Albert Einsteins hair and an Astronomical ring. The name is a combination of Plutonium and Bowl.

Signature Ability and Move

Extremely Explosive: Ballistic attacks do 1.3x damage.

Psybomb: CAT: Special BP:80 PP:12 ACCURACY: 95%

It is also a ballistic attack"

Hi I've drawn two more Pokemon since a lot of people seemed to like my last few and i enjoy drawing. This time however I've drawn two regional forms for the fan region I've been thinking about that i made a post about some time ago. These two regional forms are for the Skrelp line and the Skiddo line. The reasons why i picked these two is because they tend to be overlooked, gen 6 typically doesn't get much love compared to every other generation both by fans and by Gamefreak and also because my fan region would be located right beside Kalos in the east so i thought it would make sense. I know I'm not good at drawing so if there is any constructive criticism i would greatly appreciate it.

Königwesen Skrelp

HP: 80

Attack: 70

Defence: 30

SP.Atk: 40

SP.Def: 40

Speed: 60

Total: 320

Type: Grass/Water

Ability: Base (New ability)

The reason why the local Skrelp changed into a regional form is because around 50 years ago the sea surrounding the city Hafunft were incredibly polluted due to the fact that there were a lot of ships coming in and out of the port. This caused a colony of Skrelp and Dragalge to move into the rapidly deteriorating Aquamarine Reef. Eventually there was a large movement to clear the sea since many different Pokemon species that inhabited the reef went extinct such as Corsola. After the reef was cleared, it was discovered that the Skrelp and Dragalge that inhabited the reef were ""Purified"" of their poison type unintentionally. The new Skrelp and Dragalge were much more kind and gentle to the local pokemon and people and are much more happy.

Königwesen Skrelp evolves into Königwesen Dragalge after consuming 30 pieces of pristine kelp which is a fairly rare ingredient found in the Aquamarine Reef and Lake Azure.

Königwesen Dragalge

HP:142

Attack: 128

Defence: 57

SP.Atk: 38

SP.Def: 57

Speed: 80

Total: 494

Type: Grass/Water

Ability Base (New ability)

Königwesen Dragalge are often used when diving in Aquamarine Reef and Lake Azure due to the fact that they are very friendly and incredibly quick underwater.  The kelp which grows all over their body can also cure a lot of diseases and is very valuable. It is also the symbol of many environmental groups due to its origin and friendly personality.

Notable moves that the Königwesen Skrelp line would learn include power whip, recover, liquidation, aqua tail, light screen, reflect, trident slash, iron tail, aqua ring, leech seed, play rough, dragon tail, dragon claw, fire lash, leaf blade. These wouldn't be all of its moves however these are the moves which i think make the most sense however it wouldn't get ANY poison type moves since it would n't make sense.

Signature Ability and Move description

Base:

Any poison type move that hits this Pokemon is turned into a water type move and it can not be poisoned except by any Pokemon with corrosion.

Trident slash:

The Pokemon slashes the target with its trident like tail. It is super effective against poison types.

BP: 90

PP: 10

Type: Water

My main inspirations for this Pokemon are the mythical creature Kelpie and I also based the design of the hands and tail of a trident.

Königwesen Skiddo

HP: 56

Attack: 75

Defence: 68

SP.Atk: 42

SP.Def: 50

Speed: 59

Total: 350

Type: Grass/Rock

Ability; Rock Head/Grass Pelt, Hidden: Boulder Bulwark

The reason why it changed into its regional form is because after migrating into the Gemischt mountains from Kalos, they were nearly driven back into Kalos since there a lot of Ice and Fire type Pokemon in the Gemischt mountains however they eventually managed to survive by using the rocks that were abundant in the mountain range to defeat the Ice and Fire type Pokemon. Over time their fur coat started to change into a rock like armor and the grass that grew on their backs turned into moss since it was less likely to be frozen or burned. They are very adept at traversing mountainous environments.

Königwesen Skiddo evolves into Königwesen Gogoat once you have knocked out 10 Pokemon who are either Ice type or Fire type.

Königwesen Gogoat

HP: 81

Attack: 123

Defence: 100

SP.Atk: 62

SP.Def: 68

Speed: 97

Total: 531

Type: Grass/Rock

Ability; Rock Head/Grass Pelt, Hidden: Boulder Bulwark

Unlike normal Gogoats,  Königwesen Gogoat's horns are aimed forward and they get into fights quite frequently and they are made out of an incredibly hard rock. Their coat has also soldified into a nearly indestructible assembly of stones which makes nearly impervious to Fire and Ice type attacks.

Notable moves that the Königwesen Skiddo can learn include horn leech, head smash, stone edge, rock slide, earthquake, wild charge, synthesis, double edge, flare blitz, mossy maul, mega horn. These wouldn't be all of the moves that it can learn but i think these make the most sense.

Signature Ability and Move description

Boulder Bulwark:

This Pokemon is resistant to Ice type and Fire type attacks (Thick Fat but with a different name).

Mossy Maul:

This Pokemon slams into the enemy Pokemon using its mossy back. It causes 25% recoil damage.

BP: 80

PP: 15

Type: Grass

That is all of the Pokemon that i have drawn for this week. I worked really hard on it and i would greatly appreciate any constructive criticism on the drawing or writing. Thank you."
