I think when he uses the tentacle attack or as the person above me pointed out the puddles might be doing the life steal. I’m not entirely sure how his life steal works but this is what worked for me on M4. Hope this helps!"
borderlands3,flvsmu9,t1_flvs3l0,1585531160.0,Someone in a different thread mentioned that it was the puddles that do the life steal
borderlands3,flvs3l0,t3_fpopib,1585530801.0,"I think I figured it out! I had the same problem and died a bunch before finally getting him because he would heal instantly after doing any damage, but once I figured out what worked for me it was easy. 

He seems to have some kind of health steal and I believe its when he teleports next to you and hits you with the tentacles or something else around that time. I was able to finally beat by restarting the game (which may or may not have helped, the health steal gave him less health return after I did that but it could be unrelated) and then using a melee attack against him when he teleports next to you to stop the health steal and give you time to back away. Then spam attack with a fire element lob (or any other high powered fire element gun) . I could be totally wrong on this but thats how I was able to beat him on M4.

If anyone else has a more factual or better way to beat him please feel free to correct me on this

Looks like its the puddles that cause life steal"

schizophrenia,fk72bcc,t1_fk711v6,1583925497.0,"I had a fear that I would end up regretting my tattoo so I got it someplace it could be hidden which it sounds like yours can be hidden as well with sleeves. I think it really comes down to a personal choice, if you like them keep them but if you dont then maybe it will be easier and cheaper to remove them in the future. Whatever you decide - as long as youre making the decision based on what you want and not what you think other people want, then its the right decision"

schizophrenia,fk70nti,t1_fk703fl,1583923918.0,Im very sorry that they didnt turn out how you wanted them to i cant imagine how disappointing that was. It really freaked me out for a while that this was going to be on me until i die and if the artist messed up that was just how it was going to be so i waited a few years before finally going for it and made sure to get it done professionally and with an appointment so it could turn out how i wanted it to. I wish you the best of luck removing them if thats what you are planning on doing!
