stopdrinking,fr2jlmt,t1_fr2hrwc,1589838433.0,"I suppose.  I should be strong enough to make logical decisions despite my environment.  I managed to quit smoking years ago after a collapsed lung and surgery.  She still smoked and still does, not In my face but I always knew where her cigarettes were.  THAT was hard.  Alcohol is a different animal however. You would think it would be easier than nicotine but it serves a different function."
stopdrinking,fr2a27j,t1_fr25szq,1589833725.0,"She doesn't think so. She's much better at moderation than I am, she still suggests to me ""not to drink more when I feel like I've had enough"" and always makes sure I have access to booze if she can.  Even when I was successfully sober, and going to AA she would offer me a drink every time and keep the fridge stocked.   I don't know why I can't moderate, it's like this completely different person takes over me and I loose the capacity to make healthy decisions.  Alcohol is the only way I feel good so it's hard to stop once I start.  My way of moderation is only buying enough that won't hurt me by the time the shops close and time it so she doesn't get more. Its  embarrassingly stupid. We've been doing this for 20 years."

stopdrinking,fr1ye6e,t1_fr1g47f,1589828039.0,"Yes, we've had that talk many times.  She's very good at guiding a conversation where she wants it to go so nothing ever comes of it.  I think we both know that the most successful outcome for my health is for us to seperate. The most important thing in the world to her is to have me here (she's quite insecure) so anything that hurts me, helps her. That's my theory anyway."
stopdrinking,fr19bss,t1_fr178wx,1589815675.0,"I don't really know.  I've tried, it never works.  Councilors are money vacuums, AA meetings are nice but I  just wierd people out if I reach out to them.  I know it's all me, and how I process the world around me.  Anything I do becomes a nightmare if I involve another person.  It never works."

Sorry you are treated this way, she's probably depressed as I am.  I don't have an answer for you unfortunately, but can say she probably has trouble appreciating affection as she doesn't appreciate herself."
