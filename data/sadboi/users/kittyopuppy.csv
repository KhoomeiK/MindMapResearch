Like you, my relationship with my best friend was one-sided. I would drop whatever I had going on to help my friend, even cancelling and rescheduling my own job interviews to drive her to her‚Äôs. A couple months ago, I got a new job after working so hard to find one (was unemployed for almost a year!)

My new job required me to get a trusted non-relative to help me with my I-9 form to finish off the hiring process. I asked my friend and she agreed. Deep in my heart, I knew that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to rely on her. Five minutes after she agreed to help me, her boyfriend sent me a long, nasty text message saying that she will NOT help me, I‚Äôm on my own here, and he accused me of having COVID-19 (this was before the outbreak for bad in the US...)

I didn‚Äôt respond to either of them, and after a few days of thinking about how to handle this situation, I texted her and told her how disappointed and tired I was of always bending over backwards to help her, and the one time I need some help, she wouldn‚Äôt help. Her boyfriend has been a problem with our friendship for quite some time, and I had to set boundaries with them earlier but he would ignore all of them. 

Well after I told her how disappointed I was in her, she went crazy with verbal insults, and like your friend, she tried so hard to gaslight me. I told her right then and there that if she was truly my friend, she would respect my feelings in the very least. She refused, so I ended the friendship and deleted her number.

That was almost two months ago, and I haven‚Äôt looked back. If they caused you pain, confusion, and  were unreliable, you didn‚Äôt lose them. I‚Äôve gained peace of mind and self respect, and  a great new job, and I did it all by cutting out a very toxic person out of my life.

**You are allowed to change the price of what it costs to access you.**

If you feel that your boundaries are being disrespected even after discussing it with them, **don‚Äôt lower your price because they‚Äôre too cheap to pay what you‚Äôre worth.**  You are allowed to raise your price and add tax and a no refund policy. It really weeds out the assholes.

Best of luck, OP. Remember, ALWAYS enforce your boundaries!"
