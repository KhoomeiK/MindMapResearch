NonBinary,eon524a,t1_eok23ur,1558704569.0,"hi, thank you sm!! also i don‚Äôt mind at all!! i had my consultation all the way in mid november. he was in the middle of setting up his NC office while keeping track of his san fran office, so a lot of my insurance stuff had to be resent a few times. i also had a scare where my dad was laid off (for a day) and my insurance coverage was rescinded for that time and threw it off as well. the whole time though, his office staff was really understanding and patient. dr. beck himself in the consult told me my options and took a few pictures and was really professional but not cold/uncaring. The day of surgery, I was at the hospital about an hour and a half before my procedure and just had to be checked in and wait a little bit before being brought up to a room where they had me change and took vitals, etc. The diversity team, anesthesiologist, and nurse all came in to talk to me as well. When dr. beck came in we talked a bit about the procedure and then he started marking my chest. i actually ended up fainting for some reason after this?? but only for a few seconds and i fell onto the bed and they made sure i was okay and the surgery went on. i honestly don‚Äôt remember anything from like 10 minutes past that to when i was waking up for the 3rd time (i woke up after anesthesia, fell asleep, rinse and repeat twice more before being fully present). they told me everything went really well and went over the care instructions with my mom (and i TRIED to follow along as well lmao). they got me dressed and into a wheelchair and then i was on my way back to the hospital. right now i‚Äôm just waiting to get my bandages changed and my drains removed on the 29th, and i‚Äôll definitely update again once i do!!
