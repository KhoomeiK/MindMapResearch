BPD,etaw460,t3_capfsh,1562630711.0,I go through the same thing it's very hard for me because when I'm happy for an extended. Of time I will start to think that things are different and let my guard down. But before long my negative attitude comes back and it's like I forget ever being happy I really think it has everything to do with black and white thinking. I've gotten better at shortening the dark. Essentially what I do is what I find myself drifting into the negative I find something positive to be grateful for and I focus my obsessive thinking on that. Lately I've been thinking a lot about how blessed I am that me and my children as well as my husband have very good health and we have a roof over our heads. I keep almost meditating on that saw and distracting myself from the negative
BPD,esugxgp,t3_c91b16,1562283282.0,I used to have a problem with that big time I think that's the best way to get to the bottom of it is to find out what triggers you 2 do the impulsive shopping and then replace that shopping with a different activity. One thing really helps me is that I go to the library instead and get books and movies it makes me feel like I'm getting things but then I don't have to worry about credit card debt. The other thing I do is maybe do a free activities such as going to a swimming pool or watching TV in place of shopping. I'm not kidding you when I say that I used to go to Walmart every few days and spend two or three hundred dollars easy and never know what I got because it was all stuff I didn't need. I did this completely impulsively for years I'm happy to say that now 90% of the time I am able to prevent this. And if I do go to a store I just bring a set amount of money that I can spend and I asked myself with everything I'm purchasing do I need this will it help me if the answer is no I put it back.

BPD,erin3bk,t3_c28ajq,1560901960.0,I struggle with the people pleasing all the time. When people are upset with me I could barely even function of I think I'm garbage. Like right now for example
BPD,erim17b,t3_c23zte,1560901164.0,I used to struggle with this a lot. A big thing that has helped me is every time I'm at a store and I want to buy something I pick it up and I really hold it for a minute and ask myself a few questions. Do I want this? Do I need? Will this make my life better? Can I live without it? And can I afford it?. If I answer yes to two or more I'll generally put it in my cart and I'll walk around for a little bit and really get to thinking about it most of the time I wind up putting things back because if I start to feel guilty about grabbing them they just immediately go back I realized that if I feel the guilt in the store I'll feel even worse later. A few years ago I used to be someone who would go into Walmart and spend hundreds of dollars every other day I got into great debt this way I guess I learned the hard way LOL.
BPD,ergs1vn,t1_ergrzuv,1560855330.0,You're right. I appreciate it nice talkin to somebody that understands she's probably just a narcissist taking advantage of my mental health note to self don't tell anyone I have BPD LOL.
BPD,ergri00,t1_ergrgks,1560854605.0, thank you I appreciate that I've been struggling with this girl for almost 2 years when I try to confront her and tell her my feeling she just says I'm overreacting and blames my BPD. It's very upsetting especially since me and other people have noticed that I'm the only one she treats this way and she says I'm her best friend I think I should just cut her out of my life.
BPD,ergrdvp,t1_ergr7nc,1560854452.0,The problem is she says that she's my best friend is there and I have had multiple conversations with me telling her but I don't like when she says these things we work in a small office so if I report her she'll know and also I'm stupid enough to still be trying to be friends with her I'm kind of where my other question lies should I be trying to be friends with her or not? I keep feeling like it's not her it's the way I am taking how she behaves especially since that's how she tells me when I complain to her about how she acts towards me she says it's all me and I'm overreacting
BPD,erfuj63,t3_c1qmm9,1560818290.0,Yes
