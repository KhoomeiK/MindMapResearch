Oman,fj1jkrx,t3_favrz5,1582921423.0,"Wear a mask if you have flu like symptoms to reduce the risk of transmission as the COVID-19  particles are much too small to be stopped by a surgical mask. For now, wash and disinfect your hands regularly, avoid touching your face, especially mouth, nose and eyes. These organs have mucous membranes which allow contamination. Avoid public places as much as possible and practise these measures if you do use public facilities.

More than ever, we need to be coordinated rather than spread fear and rumors. If travelling from another country, if not already quarantined, self quarantine. If you show flu- like symptoms, visit the doctor but not before informing them in advance about your travel status so that they can make necessary arrangements. A little caution goes a long way."

Oman,fisw33q,t3_f8x7r3,1582695079.0,"Well since the MoH just asked not to buy up masks in bulk, it means we have to step up precautions. This is a developing situation. So for now, we can't just go into a panic overload. 

Observe traditional health measures. Wash your hands with soap or sanitizer, use alcohol approved disinfectant if you need to use public toilets and if you need to cough, cover your mouth and wash your hands. This works as a population. Avoid using public toilets and unless someone around you has the flu or the situation gets worse; do not use masks. Cooperation is key. And everyone needs to work together.

Also since temperatures are beginning to rise, most viruses have showed previous patterns of decreasing. We can only hope COVID - 19 does too."
