relationships,f6dr2hu,t3_dqudz6,1572796361.0,"I completely understand what you are going through.  I stopped going to my husband's family holidays years ago and it was the best thing I ever did for myself.  

I was an ""outsider"" in his family.  His sisters and father treated the mother (M) of my husband's son (never married to M) more of a sister/daughter-in-law than I ever was.  One example is that one of his sisters had a destination wedding. The family made sure that M was there and paid for all of her expenses as well.  My husband and I had 2 children by that time and weren't in a financial position to even send him alone to his sisters wedding (I was absolutely fine with me staying home with the kids so he could attend).  He made it clear to his father and sister that he couldn't afford the trip.  No financial assistance was offered to him so he didn't attend.  He was so hurt by this and I was absolutely appalled that they would make sure M was there instead of their son/brother. I think that was my final straw in a string of similar incidents with his family.  

I have a very good relationship with my husband's son and his wife, they completely understand where I am coming from and can see it as well.  They think it is weird that M still goes to family functions - it was understandable when the son was 10 (his age when I started dating my husband) but now that he is 30 and married, M's attendance is weird.  Especially with the whole family knowing my husband's and my feelings about her attending family functions. My husband doesn't want her there any more than I do.  

I never stopped my husband or kids from going to family events, I just opted out.  For years he made excuses for my absence, until one time when he said I wasn't feeling well my youngest daughter corrected him by letting everyone know  in her 8-9 year old child way that I wasn't sick at all.  Lol out of the mouths of babes.

I wish you well OP. My advice to you is to hold your ground and do what makes you feel the most comfortable."
