relationships,ffc63jm,t3_esu2yh,1579792401.0,"This is gonna sound like wierd advice, bit hear me out:

You should learn how to knit. Start off with something simple, like a potholder. It'll only take an hour or so, so its not a huge time sink. Give it to your mom. Even if it looks like shit, moms love stuff like that. Next, move on to making a scarf. Pick your favorite colors and alternate however you want. Maybe itll be too short or too skinny or be falling apart or full of mistakes, but what you made is yours. You created something of your own! Its only for you and even if its not perfect, you've officially done something for yourself. On top of that, its impossible to say that you're nothing after doing that. You're a knitter now. :)

Maybe knitting isn't your style and youd rather do something like woodworking, origami, baking, etc but finding something just for you to make things that you truly enjoy can really help you feel independent. Things are really rough for you right now, maybe the worst ever, but you deserve to be your own person again. Good luck. I believe in you."

My types for dudes are the sweet artistic type, so when i started crying in the woods because i wanted sufjan stevens to be my boyfriend, I knew somwthing was fucked up. I also have a complicated relationship with male attraction, so its taken me a lot longer to get here. I think a good first step would be to try and at least remove your own disgust, as its often an irrational voice in your head speaking. I know its the most trite thing ever on this subreddit, but obviously therapy could help sort out your feelings. Best of luck!"

A similar thing would happen to me, I would be dating wonderful, smart, beautiful women bit I didn't want to do anything intimate at all. It has taken a lot of time to come to terms with things, but I've finally come to terms with it. My case is pretty unusual, but it could be worth it to just think things over and explore how you feel.
A useful exercise I've learned is to imagine a man who you think is attractive. Would you kiss him? Want to build a life with him? How does that feel in your mind compared to being with a woman? 
If that doesn't appeal to you, it could be just nerves, but if you feel like something might be there, it could be good to persue that instead.
Good luck! If it is some other issue, I wish the best of luck to you and your girlfriend. :)"
