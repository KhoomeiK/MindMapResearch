woodworking,flc71aa,t3_fnssq2,1585021586.0,"Thats definately pine by the looks of it. Old growth for sure. The grain just doesnt flow like cherry. As for refinishing: paint stripper with coarse steel wool. Once you have most of the old finish off,  use paint thinner to finish off the remaining residue. DO NOT SAND! After, progress through the steel wool grits up to no.3 (medium). Once you have a clean, unfinished surface, use stain or dye (dye soaks into the wood, stain sits ontop ((dye is also darker than stain when applied, also depending on your dye concentration)) ). Apply as much coats BUT no more than three coats. Allow the stain/dye to dry for atleast 24 hours. You can use your top coat of choice, though i like shellac for its 'antique' look, its also very traditional. Use 4/0 steel wool to finalize your final top coat finish, and i usually use paste wax with a hint of clear oil to polish the top coat"
