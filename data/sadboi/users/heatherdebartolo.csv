This is awful, unfortunately the was a very common occurrence for people in your situation. The first step you need to take is to call the insurance and find out if this is a deductible. If it is, you will have to meet it whether you pay it now or when something else gets filled. You also need to ask, how do I get this for as cheap as possible. They may refer you to order in through the mail (this has become very popular) or they may say that you have use a particular pharmacy for filling. The next step is to tell them you need enough to get you through until you receive it. It is possible for them to do an ‚Äúemergency fill‚Äù the insurance will coordinate with the pharmacy to fill (just) enough to cover until you receive your mail order‚Äîbe warned, a bill may come in the mail at a later date to cover the cost but at least it won‚Äôt be required right this second.
