But not all people with BPD are abusive. 
Assigning someone's abusive behaviour to the fact they have BPD is damaging for people with BPD who are not abusive. 

Even if all of your ex's behaviour related to their BPD, they are just one person and people reading your comment could easily take away that all people with BPD are like that which is very untrue. 

I say this as a person with diagnosed 'textbook' BPD who ticks every box of the diagnostic criteria.

I'm not trying to invalidate your experience. 
I just want people to understand BPD better.

Your partner being mentally unwell is not her fault but the actions she takes based on it are. She doesn't seem to care for your feelings, is incredibly dismissive and doesn't appear to actively try to do or change or even be responsible for anything. 

I would sit her down for a last, really serious talk, tell her again how you feel, if she brushes it off ask her why she insists on invalidating your feelings.
