You have it in you. You are the one who can control your life and no one else can control your happiness other than yourself. Everything is gona be alright buddy. Trust in yourself"

UnsentLetters,etznhim,t3_ce5f6e,1563334244.0,I just can't say how much i can relate to this. There is this girl i really like and unfortunately its only one sided love. I can't do anything that would make her unhappy or uncomfortable. It pains me to think i would never be the one that makes her happy :(
