Advice,fq8laqi,t1_fq8klxh,1589168874.0,"thank you for your response! I have mentioned it to him a few months ago and he sort of understood, but also said he doesn't have anyone else to talk to about it which I also understand. He does have a bunch of friends he could talk to but he doesn't feel comfortable going to them. What frustrates me even more is that I wish he would talk to me more about it instead of talking to his mom. He dismisses all our conversations about our issues which then makes it turn into a fight. but then goes and talks to his mom about it. idk, i don't want to ask him to stop talking to her about us but just maybe not as much and not about more serious/personal issues? would that be wrong of me to ask?"

Anxiety,f49xqy6,t3_dk0wds,1571485820.0,"I had a similar issue. I was terrified of getting kidnapped while everyone was sleeping, a murderer, the house catching on fire, thieves, etc. I would have nightmares about it. and when I slept over a friends house, I would get so scared something was going to happen to my parents or sister while I was gone. I used to have a friend that lived like 2 minutes away on the same street as me and every time I went to her house, if I heard any sirens outside I would freak out and think they were going to my house. Sometimes my thoughts were a little vivid but not too much. You aren't screwed up for this at all! It's all part of anxiety and it's your brain going into fear mode."

I think its certainly worth a try! The worst that can happen is you waste maybe 30-60 minutes of your day.
Advice,f49s6h7,t3_dk1db3,1571482127.0,"Hi! So I have an interesting perspective for you... I'm in a very very similar situation except I was the unmotivated girlfriend. I have depression and anxiety and it caused me to stop going to college. My boyfriend has been really fed up with my ""laziness"" as he calls it and how I don't really do much with my life. But recently, things have started turning around for me and I've been applying to a ton of jobs and I'm also planning on going back to school to finish my degree. Just wanted to give you that background before I get into it. 

To be honest, there is really nothing you can do but be supportive of her. You have to make sure her mental health is not getting in the way of YOUR well-being. It's not your sole responsibility to help her get through the day. Thats draining for you to do every day. You should encourage her to go do things on her own and be able to get through the day without you. The one thing you don't want to be is a crutch for her. She needs to be independent and take care of herself. If she can't do that without someone helping her, then she may need more professional help. I know you said she's going to counselors but if that's not helping then she may need some sort of mental health program. What really helped me was just knowing my bf was there for me. I think I put too much responsibility on him and I stressed him out because I was so depressed at some points. He communicated that to me and at first I was a little annoyed because I felt like he was getting mad at me for being depressed but then I realized how much stress I was putting on him and I apologized. Even through all that he supported me and never gave up on me. So don't give up on her but also don't ruin your own health by putting so much of yourself into helping her (if that makes sense!) Feel free to message me if you ever want to talk!"

Don't take it personally because from what you said, it seems like it was not anger directed towards you. He still shouldn't have done that and it does not excuse his behavior."
Advice,f49qo9o,t3_dk1gsd,1571480403.0,"I had a pretty toxic life at home when I was in high school but my situation was a little different than yours. I fought with my parents A LOT and sometimes it would escalate to things being broken. However, I definitely played a large part in it all and it was not fully either of my parent's faults. That being said, we are now in a MUCH better place and my relationship with them is no longer toxic at all. 

I would say the best thing to do for you is to just try and ignore it for the rest of the day. Definitely don't get payback by breaking something of his and if you don't think talking to them about it will be helpful, then don't do that either. I also think its completely reasonably for you to not want to see him for the rest of the day but if that would cause another argument, then don't be obvious by going out of your way to avoid him. I see a much larger issue in the sense that you said your parents make your home environment toxic in general and I think that's something you should either see a school counselor for or a therapist. My parents and I worked through our issues in family therapy and it helped everything. You would be surprised what a therapist might be able to uncover about your relationship with them as well as what they may be able to do to help improve home environment. I highly recommend going to talk to someone about this! It seems like you will benefit from that. 

If you ever need to talk, please don't hesitate to message me!"

BodyDysmorphia,f40gmzr,t1_f40g7nw,1571297810.0,"Forgot to say a couple things: a HUGE part of BDD is comparing yourself to others. Getting stuck in comparison mode with BDD is very detrimental and having people posting selfies on here would just encourage comparing. Sorry, I'm just very strongly against having selfies allowed in this group. I used to compare myself to everyone and I know if this were a few years go, adding selfies to this group would make me feel so much worse and I wouldn't have felt like it's a place I can go to anymore. I'm doing better with the comparing now so I think I could handle it but I know there are people who wouldn't be able to. It would really ruin the sub for a lot of people, please don't allow them!

\- I think they could be improved. I think the flairs people listed on this post are great ideas! (such as vent, rant, need advice, progress)

\- I see some comments about selfies and I personally don't think selfies should be allowed. From a mental health perspective - they are very triggering to some people. This sub is a safe place where people discuss BDD without feeling judged or inferior to others. I think if people in this group who aren't comfortable with posting a selfie saw other people doing it and receiving compliments, it would make them feel horrible and ruin the sub for them. There are plenty of other subs where selfies can be posted. I don't think a sub about BDD is the right place to be posting selfies. Even if you had a rule about only positive selfies, it would still get messy and still be triggering. Just my thoughts on it!"

I was never worried about anti-aging before I got this procedure but now it's all I think about when I look in the mirror- that I look so old for my age. My skin just looks old because since the Botox completely took away the muscle volume in my jaw, it created loose skin. I now have wrinkles and weird lines/lumps - don't really know how to explain it. My face just doesnt look right! 

I got it done in the first place because I wanted to relieve grinding my teeth at night, but I also had this idea in my head that my jaw was too big which I now realize was ridiculous. I look back at photos of me before I had it done and I think I used to have the perfect jawline :( 

I am considering getting filler in the jawline but I don't know if I can trust anyone with my face again or inject anything else into it. I'm afraid of it looking worse than it already does. 

The look I'm trying to achieve now is just back to my normal jawline! which was defined and angular, but not manly

Something that helps me is taking deep breaths and telling myself that I'm okay. which tbh sounded stupid when i first heard it and i didn't think it would help but it actually does. It calms down my worrying thoughts and sort of brings me more into the moment. I feel like whenever I leave my house my mind races with anxious thoughts and i get so in my head. taking the deep breaths makes me more present and gets me out of my head a bit. I also sometimes write down a list of everything I'm anxious about and why right before I go out.

Since I had such large masseters before, it helped stretch my skin over my entire face and now that its not there anymore, skin doesnt have anything to stretch over, especially under my eyes. hope that makes sense, kinda hard to explain lol so basically I'm looking to replace the volume I lost but I don't know if it will give the same tightening effect as my actual muscles did or if it will make things look worse. Did you or your friend notice if it kind of pulled on your smile lines (if you have them) to smooth them out at all?"
BeautyBoxes,ep6wzkz,t1_ep08wkr,1559074599.0,"ive been watching her for a lonnng time and a lot of that is for views. a lot of people are also commenting about how they don't think she really had an opioid addiction because her ""withdrawal symptoms"" are nothing like actual opioid withdrawal symptoms. i have no idea if she really did or not and i don't know much about opioid addiction but that's just what people are saying!"
BeautyBoxes,ep35lz9,t1_ep24qm7,1559017705.0,lol its just facts sweet winter child. i'd recommend doing some research on the world of business because clearly you don't know too much. :/
BeautyBoxes,ep245zl,t1_ep0mdnv,1559001559.0,"well no, that's not entirely correct. a store that's charging $40 for a shirt will likely use a higher quality fabric. Take a store like forever21 - cheap inexpensive clothing but usually not good quality. Things rip, stretch out, etc. But the amount they charge for their clothes is reasonable because they are lower quality. A store like Madewell is more expensive because the stuff they sell is made of more expensive, better quality materials. They won't get worn out like forever21 clothing. It's all about charging for the quality you're giving your customers. She's selling insanely low quality products that will easily break at a high cost. Therefore, taking advantage of them because she knows they'll buy them anyway. The people that are purchasing the products are expecting good quality since its $60"
BeautyBoxes,eoz2jk9,t1_eox4x6x,1558952532.0,a trash video to match the trash subscription box
BeautyBoxes,eoz2j3i,t1_eoye9qr,1558952511.0,"yeah true, idk i just feel like its scammy because she knows her fans will buy whatever she sells and trust that they will be good products. I think if they knew where it was coming from, not nearly as many would purchase it. the thing that gets me is that she's purposely trying to make as much money as possible off her fans - the people that support her and contributed to the luxurious lifestyle she lives. She has the ability to set a more affordable price with the extremely low cost of curating the box."
BeautyBoxes,eowxosd,t1_eowx20k,1558916329.0,yeah that's true. and agreed! it's all cheaply made products. i don't think it's worth $60 at all it just seems scammy to me!
BeautyBoxes,eowwkkh,t1_eowvnff,1558915870.0,and even double their wholesale price would be under $4 for each product besides the hair stuff
BeautyBoxes,eowwc25,t1_eowvnff,1558915780.0,yeah but it's still not worth even close to $150+
BeautyBoxes,eowtr3c,t3_bruz3s,1558914781.0,The box is a scam according to the proof in this vid [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pe-Jfp8m1g&t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pe-Jfp8m1g&t=4s)
