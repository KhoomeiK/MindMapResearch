Do you have access to an ice pack? Putting one on the back of your neck can cool you down very effectively. 

Also, and I know it sounds strange, but a hot shower before bed will make your body temperature plunge when you get out. 

A powerful fan at night could help and also drown out the other noise out there. 

And lastly, and I know this can be a pain if you haven't done it regularly up until now, not eating at least 5-6 hours, if not more, before going to bed. Fasting through the evenings can potentially quiet your system enough that you're less suceptible to heat. Or even just what kinds of foods you eat for dinner. Hot food will warm you up. A cold salad or some fruit might be more soothing in that way.

Only thing for mosquitos I can think of is there are some bug repellent sprays or candles. But they can sometimes be finicky and I def don't want you to accidentally have a fire hazard anywhere.

Hope that can be of any help in your situation. Good luck!"

Have you ever looked into Magnesium and how much you might be getting from your diet? I don't want you to think that I'm saying your panic attack was because of a chemical imbalance INSTEAD of real problems and stresses going on in your life because it's all valid.

But magnesium is an important electrolyte that almost everyone and their mother is deficient. It's in dark chocolate, wild salmon (this is the best nutritional source) and some vegetables.

It's also found in special magnesium oil you can buy that you put on your skin and even Epsom salts you can buy for pretty cheap at any grocery store in the bath section. You know, up your shower game.

Just something that can maybe help in that very real struggle. A tool in your belt. Stress is a real and, at times, intangible struggle. But there are some physical factors that we can experiment with that can help.

Best of luck."

Those kinds of comments can really dig into our skin. People are insensitive even when unintentionally and it sucks. They can completely derail us for such a long time but if you can, don't let him have the satisfaction. Don't let it drag you down anymore.

productivity,fp1ymjj,t3_gaux7x,1588251255.0,"I know this might sound stupid, but it could be related to what you're eating throughout the day.

It could also be fluctuating blood sugar levels due to sugar or complex carbs -- a lot of people have feelings of fatigue and drowsiness around 2/3pm due to insulin resistance problems.

Walking is a great idea, especially for writing. If you think you can do it in a safe and comfortable way, consider skipping or delaying a meal (while still staying well hydrated) and see if it can quiet your system.

TooAfraidToAsk,foq8j8f,t3_g8yrub,1587986699.0,"I would say it's more normal than we think. And with some good self awareness and character building, we can make sure it doesn't ruin our relationships (because unchecked, it can be toxic). 

In my experience, when we are less sympathetic, it's not because we're inherently bad. Usually, it has either to do with deep insecurity or underlying stress.

Any kind of insecurity we may have deep inside will make it harder to feel sympathetic for even close friends. It will instead make a part of us feel like we're in competition with other people. So when something bad happens to someone else, before we can genuinely feel bad for them, we'll first feel just glad that it didn't happen to us. Perhaps the insecurity is general. Or perhaps its specifically tied to the person we're not feeling sympathetic for.

And if it's stress, our entire biology will be predisposed to caring only about yourself and what you need. Even someone close to us may be processed in the brain as 'non-essential' during that time if their life does not directly affect ours in that moment. We'll be less inclined to offer sympathy or care too much about what they're going through. And stress is not rational. So even if we're not stressed about anything as significant as life and death, our brain will often still process our stress over the stress of others.

This is all kind of a bummer. But it's also very human. I suspect a lot more people deal with this than they let on out of fear.

I would say don't worry about it too much. Don't let it influence your behavior to the point that it hurts other people. And whenever you can make time and have the patience, keep working on addressing these potential causes.

Ironically, getting to a place where we truly do feel better about ourselves and can care about other stresses less is when it becomes easier to care more about others. You'll get there..."

BUT! The value of a college program is still worth considering.

In my experience, one of the most important things you can do during your time at school is work on personal projects in an environment that can support it. Screenplays for sure. But shorts or projects would be even better. Class projects are good. Personal things, even better.

My advice would be to find the school that has the best ecosystem beyond the classes themselves. How many extracurricular projects could you do? How apathetic are other students outside of classes?

What I would look at between both schools is which one has a better ecosystem in which to collaborate with other people, preferably other filmmakers. To actually make things while you are still in school and NOT just school projects."

writing,fo8x7t9,t3_g6dqf8,1587605745.0,"Perhaps it depends on the medium but imo, to keep your story as precise, compelling, and accessible as possible, the story should be outlined around the development of your character first. 

The problem is if you keep character development loose and just see where the story takes you, your story may not play out like a story and more as a series of events. Things will feel more circumstantial. People may ask: ""why is it happening this way?""

If you base it on what your character needs, however, everything is in service, one way or another, to that arc. Stories that aren't built around the arcs of their protagonist are the ones that easily become convoluted.

Full disclosure, I come more from the screenwriting world but I think there are elements of good storytelling that overlap with all mediums of storytelling.

Story is, ultimately, about the character arc. Character development is your DNA, the fundamental building blocks. To me, anything else is a sequence of events or worldbuilding. Not storytelling.
