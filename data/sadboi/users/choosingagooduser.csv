No one will remember most of our names after 2/3 generations after us. And that IF we're lucky to have a Fam and have our kids love us to share their kids with us, and grandkids remembering us to say our names often.

So...logically, we are all worthless. Your stepfather/mother and their expectations? Worthless. Your cousin outing you? Worthless. This way of thinking helped me deal with past trauma. The impermanence of ourselves. 

At the same time, we are made of stars. And your presence will light up someone's eyes and hearts whenever you come into a room. Your 10 year old friend might be a living proof of that.

Read Cosmos by Carl Sagan if you can. Lovely book by a lovely human being. 

You also say in other replies that you aim to serve, mate...that's the best start to developing your best you. No one can ever hurt you as much again...and you're still here. So give it another shot. 

The world, and us in it deserve to have you around, making us all a bit better. Wish you could update us on your life in a month, or when you're 18.

Please don't kill yourself without seeing the world and the beautiful people in it.

depression,fls0j2z,t3_fqnuc9,1585431774.0,"Hey, a couple of things.

Just for you wanting a better life means you know there's better out there.

Your nickname may infer the feeling is due to a lost love? I didn't got through your profile but if it is due to love, it's a passing feeling called sadness.

As to friends, people don't really become friends per se. They share time with each other, and call each other. Mostly out of needing someone. Or wanting social acceptance. 

Once YOU are the one saying positive things to your acquaintances and validating them,  you'll find how easy it is to have ""friends"" and be the one who is called every Friday and Saturday.
If you even have money to buy drinks, smokes or drugs...hey you're the king of the weekend!!

Hopefully you'll loose interest in these types of friends.

Then you get people that get together to share a hobbie. In the end the hobbie is the objective and you are just a ""colleague"".

I have found once you realise that friendship isn't someone who ""has your back and will love you forever"", then it's easier to build relationships where there is no need for validation and no egotrips which waste your time.

So don't waste your time being the guy others use for self validation. Use your time to make yourself the best you can be. That means choosing to spend time with someone ""better"" than you.

Good luck"
