BPD,fkdwvqp,t3_fhrelw,1584098376.0,"Okay, so I know exactly what you're talking about and would like you to tell you this:

There is no evidence to suggest a link between intelligence/self-awareness and conscientious in people. People with BPD (Pwbpd) ARE generally very intelligent, perceptive, self-aware and insightful. BUT, almost by definition of the condition, Pwbpd have great potential but do not have the emotional regulation that others may have...it is the emotional regulation that bridges cognitive understanding of life and the world with the individual's overall personal outlook and philosophy. Pwbpd can understand cognitively, but not internalize observations into their core beliefs. We identify the subtleties without the self-directedness to apply our knowledge in our own lives. It isn't a personal shortcoming...in the same way the body's immune system failing when you have malaria isn't the patient's shortcoming.

In short, it is NOT your fault or a lack of incentive or poor discipline or whatever else it may seem to you. It is a very specific complex psychological phenomenon that needs to be treated through targeted and specialised therapy. And with therapy (with the right doctors and the right medication; bit of a trial-and-error effort, I'm afraid) you can unburden yourself of the core beliefs that the prevent your mind from connecting the dots logically."
