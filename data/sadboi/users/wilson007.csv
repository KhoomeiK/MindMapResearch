There's only so many times a new thread can go through the upper before the integrity is lost. In a moccasin construction, the upper goes [all the way across the bottom of the shoe](https://findsourcing.blob.core.windows.net/images/0-24..png), and it's typically thick leather, so they can handle a lot of resoles. [This pair, using CXL, has gone through 4 resoles](https://i.imgur.com/HbcJ1dj.jpg) and look fine. With dress shoes, the upper is lasted from the top-down, so it doesn't go all through the bottom of the insole. This places more stress on the welt. Additionally, the thinner leather is more likely to crack, rip, or otherwise wear out. 

Conversely, with a goodyear welted shoe, you're only stitching through the welt during a resole. If the welt gets worn out due to repeated resoles, it can be replaced. Good cobblers will reuse the same holes in the upper, and the structural integrity of the leather is maintained. Each welt can give multiple resoles, so the lifespan of a GYW shoe is really only limited by the leather quality of the upper. 

Practically speaking, there's probably 1% of shoes in the collections of members on this entire subreddit that have gone through more than 2 resoles, so the differences we're talking about are more theoretical than pragmatic."

The toes are just a nature of moccasin construction. You're getting two thick pieces of leather and stitching them together with both raw edges showing. You could return them for another pair that might have a bit more skiving done, but there's nothing structurally wrong unless the actual sew is loose (which it doesn't appear to be).

As you mentioned, the leather is just the nature of CXL. It's to be expected. 

Not sure what crooked stitching you're referring to. Even if there was a tiny bit of variation... these are hand made and cost $300-something bucks, they're not $1500 Edward Greens.

Not sure what you're referring to about the heel. I can't see anything coming unglued. They're blake stitched (as all moccasins are), so they look normal. 

I can't see any water spotting on the insole, but if there is something minor on them...  I mean... your foot will be stepping on them sweating all day anyway...

regarding the footbed insert, the glue may have come off. The heat and pressure from wearing them may restick them, but a dab of shoe goo or all purpose cement will stick them in there for good. 

Good questions overall, but nothing I'd consider returning something for if you otherwise like them. Only real ""issue"" is whether you're ok with the toes. That's more of a design thing, and another boot might get it a bit tighter, but that seam will widen on any moc-toe as they age anyway, and it's not a structural problem."
