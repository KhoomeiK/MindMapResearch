depression,fqqmn12,t3_gk7mgh,1589568184.0,"I feel you. I can only really talk about past episodes, like ""oh yeah, that was bad, but I'm all better now!"". When I'm actively depressed, I try to keep it a secret. Nobody ever knows what to do with depressed me. Lots of people get panicky and smother me with daily inquiries about my status and vague offers of help. Others seem cool with it but then just try really hard to avoid the subject. 

So I just withdraw and try to keep up a minimum of contact. I'll decline party invitations, but I also set reminders to text people once in a while and try to answer texts once a day. Maybe hang out one on one. 

I think you should tell friends that you have depression or whatever mental illness, just so you don't have to lie when it comes up. This way, you don't have to pretend to have food poisoning when you miss someone's birthday party. You don't need to tell them that you haven't showered in a week or that you can't even find the will to buy groceries, much less go to a party. The dirty details aren't necessary. But it's helpful if you can refer back to the previously established fact that you have depression so they don't take offense at your absence. 

Other than that, I keep the sharing to a minimum. We get so desensitized to the dark stuff that it's easy to forget that other people might be shocked by something we can laugh off. It's like a police officer making conversation about the details of a murder. Most people just can't handle it. Questions are great, though! I'll happily try to explain my fucked up bits if they really want to know. I'm not forcing it on anyone, though."

BipolarReddit,fpxhv12,t3_gftmhn,1588982925.0,"Well, there's the standard overeating while depressed (can't feel sad when you are too stuffed to stay awake), undereating while depressed (can't reach fridge from bed) and undereating while hypomanic (too busy busy busy). 

I also have an actual eating disorder, ARFID. I've had it longer than I've been bipolar and it is still very much an issue when I am otherwise stable. It is definitely affected by the bipolar, though. Depression will make it much worse and I'll lose safe foods. Doesn't matter if my appetite in general is increased or decreased by any particular episode - I'll gravitate towards bland, beige, carby food either way."

fatlogic,fpnplq6,t1_fphiveq,1588769731.0,"Just a caveat: Many people with eating disorders don't neatly match the usual categories. You might alternate between severe restriction and binge eating for weeks at a time, completely wrecking your physical and mental health, while essentially maintaining the same weight in the long run. 

So while the term ""anorexic"" is often misused by FAs, it can be very invalidating to actual EDNOS sufferers to ridicule the notion that someone could have a restrictive ED at a higher weight. This could make their disordered behavior more extreme or make them less likely to get help (because they hear ""I'm not sick enough to need/deserve help yet""). 

Just a heads up to anyone reading this to be a bit more mindful of their phrasing. I've seen a lot of posts and comments lately that are pretty oblivious about eating disorders.

Do I carry lasting trauma? Sure do. 
Do I blame her for having bipolar symptoms? No, that would be hypocritical.  

But I do blame her for not getting help (she was already diagnosed). I blame her for actively hiding symptoms from my dad. I blame her for pretending everything was peachy until the police came to take her to inpatient. 

Maybe that helps you see things from another perspective. You are not responsible for your illness, but sometimes you just have to continue life knowing that you caused pain. That doesn't make you a shitty person. All you can do is to prepare for future episodes by learning your warning signs, practising awareness, and building a support system of people who will help you when you can't help yourself."

ARFID,fg6s60z,t3_ewalu1,1580575650.0,"Oh wow. That sounds awful. I agree that I'd call your parents negligent if you were a child. Stating the obvious, though, you are an adult. What's stopping you from buying food yourself? 

I'm not trying to be mean, I hope it doesn't come across that way. But even if you can't drive, surely there's at least a convenience store within walking distance of home/school/work. Or you could order groceries online. Or you could ask a friend for help. 

It sucks that your parents don't take you seriously, but you are old enough to take responsibility for your own nutritional needs. Your post sounds so defeated and helpless, but you don't live in a cage, right?"

ARFID,fg6qdyi,t3_ewa9uv,1580574483.0,"Please don't punish her. I know others have said it, but this is very important. Creating a hostile atmosphere around food will make her worse in the long run. Let her eat, as long as she eats at all! The decision to try something new has to come from within her, in a relaxed situation where she is safe. Threatening negative consequences is still force feeding even if the force isn't physical. 

I know you mean well. So did my parents! But it took me years to recover from their attempts to help me and I don't wish that on your daughter. 

Thank you for asking, sincerely."

depression,ff8lhor,t3_eryem8,1579684332.0,"I know exactly what you mean. That sudden relief from the depression is the most beautiful thing in the world. You get things done, you have boundless energy, life is just... good. Until it fizzles out and you're left worse off than you were before. 

I'm also diagnosed with bipolar disorder. You say you've been off meds for a while, but do you still have access to whoever treated you before? Or a therapist, or even a primary care doctor? You should really tell someone about these bursts of energy. 

Now I can't diagnose you, but it certainly sounds familiar. I want you to get help for this because, even though the temporary reprieve from depression feels good, it just gets worse in the long term. If you do have bipolar disorder, and you don't get help, the switching will likely happen more frequently and both the ups and downs will become more intense over time. However, there's meds out there that will prevent this escalation and that may even prevent or at east alleviate most future depressive episodes. 

Let me know how you're holding up. I know coming down after an up where you thought you just finally got your shit together is the worst."

YouOnLifetime,fd66dr9,t1_fc5oqew,1578186163.0,"I agree. There was no need to name drop a diagnosis. They could've left it at ""psychotic"", which would've been a)  medically correct and  b) a good play on words coming from someone who is ""psycho"" in the colloquial sense. 

Now some viewers are left with the impression that mania with psychotic features is a thing that happens after two days without mood stabilizers. Not cool."
ARFID,fbszgae,t1_fbsugjz,1577064283.0,"That sounds awful, sorry that happened to you. I wish information about ARFID was more readily available to parents. Good intentions mixed with ignorance cause so much harm."
ARFID,fbp9kw6,t3_edvazg,1577018948.0,"I actually think that my parents' attempts to fix me made my ARFID considerably worse. They developed a rule where they would pre-portion my plate and I was only allowed to take a second helping of my safe foods when this first plate had been cleared. There was a lot of arguing around food. The kitchen was locked between mealtimes to stop me from filling up on cereal and bread beforehand. 

Anyone with ARFID can guess what happened: I never finished a plate, I stopped trying the unsafe foods because forcing down a single bite didn't provide any benefits, I lost weight from the restricted portion sizes and learned to accept the constant sensation of hunger. 

I was 8-12 years old at the time. Once they gave up on trying to fix me, I instantly started getting better. It's sad that it took my pediatrician telling them I needed to gain weight before they'd let me fill up on safe foods. Of course, by that point, I didn't really understand the concept of being pleasantly full. 

The damage that remains with me into adulthood is this inability to judge satiation. I'm always either losing or gaining weight. It's a battle between emotional overeating (to the point of actual bingeing), forgetting to eat, being disgusted by food, or tightly controlling my diet by counting calories and macros."

de,f9b31s7,t1_f92rsu2,1575208790.0,"Asexualität ist eben nicht als fehlendes Verlangen nach Sex definiert, die Libido hat damit nichts zu tun. Asexualität bedeutet, sich zu keinem Geschlecht sexuell hingezogen zu fühlen. So wie ein schwuler Mann sich nicht zu Frauen hingezogen fühlt, kann es eben auch sein, dass man einfach niemanden sexuell attraktiv findet. Ob und mit wem man Sex hat, ist erst mal irrelevant. Klar leben viele asexuelle Menschen abstinent, aber eben nicht alle. Zum Beispiel wegen Kinderwunsch oder dem Partner zuliebe. Oder einfach weil Libido auch nichts mit der sexuellen Orientierung zu tun hat und sich eben auch über Fetische ausleben lässt - dafür muss man seine Partner nicht inhärent attraktiv finden. Körperlich ist ja alles in funktionsfähigem Zustand und ein Orgasmus ist schon ne nette Sache. 

Ich hoffe, das klärt die Verwirrung! Der Begriff der Asexualität wird leider sehr oft falsch definiert, selbst in Medien, die gutgemeinte Aufklärungsarbeit leisten wollen."
