My breasts have never felt so supported, the band is on the widest clasp and doesn't feel loose (and hopefully means I will get a longer life out of this bra when the band inevitably starts to wear down) and because of the added support the bra is even encouraging better posture!

Definitely need to get a few more bras so I don't destroy this one by overwearing it."

BDSMcommunity,fqu69rt,t1_fqrab3i,1589652843.0,"Thanks for this comment! I very recently have dipped my toe into the BDSM pool and want to talk to my therapist about it because I am having some very confusing and conflicted thoughts. Basically boils down to pre-judgement of myself. Ie, is something wrong with me because non-kink sex really doesn't do much for me, but if you call me a slut and claim ownership and control over me I am soooo into that. My main concern is he will judge me like I have been judging myself. He's been my therapist for 10 years, so I also think it's gonna surprise him and result in possible questions like ""what brought this on now?""

However, this change has done literal wonders for my self esteem and I want to discuss it with my therapist. I feel like I'm rediscovering myself and embracing my body rather than hating it and that this could be the start of a new and positive chapter in my life. I'm a control freak in every day life and surrendering that control is freeing and amazing. I have a lot of self esteem issues which have made it difficult for me to enjoy sex in the past, but when I play that all goes out the window because I feel so incredibly wanted and even though I am 100% submissive I still feel powerful knowing that ultimately I am the one ceding that control to my dom.

It's also funny because I am the first person to encourage people to embrace non traditional things they enjoy, but I'm still sitting her like ""thats okay for other people, but not me!"" and I don't know why I am making myself the exception to embracing it fully and feel like I need to work through that.

BDSMcommunity,fqmh1ze,t1_fqk20wm,1589477324.0,"My partner and I JUST started exploring bdsm and while it is all super new (and exciting!), I am so grateful we have been together for 13 years because I trust him 100% and it makes the communication piece so much easier. The only real awkwardness was when I laid it all out there that I've always really wanted to be dominated but only recently was willing to acknowledge/ask for it and waiting for his reaction. All the other awkwardness is pretty much to be expected so it doesn't necessarily feel awkward, more like growing pain, I guess.

We've played a little bit almost every day since I told him, just trying to figure out our preferences and the roles we'd like to play, and we have never been so intimate and cuddly in our relationship like we are now. I feel closer to him in a way I did not expect, the complete and total surrender is incredibly freeing and even though I've always trusted him, it's just on a whole new level now. 

All this to say, not OP, but I greatly appreciate the detailed reply because it's helped me work through some confusing and conflicting thoughts I've experienced since admitting my own wants and desires. Thanks!"

This was before cell phones were everywhere so we had to call AAA on a payphone and they couldn't come and help for an estimated 2.5 hrs.

QAS also covered the vet bills for my cat because she developed an URI within 24 hrs of being home and they knew she could have only caught it at the shelter prior to adoption. Was incredibly grateful because she needed sub-q fluids, antibiotics, and an appetite stimulant and the bill would have cost me like $400.

When I got my second cat I did try Standish, they were great and very helpful, but the cat I saw didn't seem like a good fit for my family or my first cat. However, they were really great to work with either way and their shelter location is really awesome! Ended up adopting from Happy Tails Pet Rescue whch is a non profit. They were also great to work with, but the process did take longer.

Edit: it is worth mentioning I had zero concern the cats I adopted might get snatched before I had the chance to finish the process. Both of them were adults so that already made them less desirable and my first cat was just a nervous wreck that acted like a stuffed animal because she was so terrified. No one was really interested in her as a result. My second cat is FIV+ so he was even less likely to be adopted due to his completely manageable (he requires no meds) health condition.

Your probably right about the litterbox peeing being stress related. Sometimes buying a brand new litterbox (like different design), in addition to the ones you have, can help kitty remember to use the box. If she's literally peeing just outside the box, lay down some puppy pads or towels you dont care about to make clean up super easy. 

I am saying this next bit gently because I don't think you're neglecting your beloved cat, but cats get these weird behaviors with the bathroom and some cat owners don't know it's a cat thing. If she was at any point experiencing any sort of discomfort while peeing in that litterbox some cats are just like ""nope, never using that litterbox again cause it hurts"" and they can associate the discomfort with the box itself! That's one reason why I suggest just getting a brand new box. If she continues to use the box, just not consistently then stress is the more likely culprit.

I've used feliway diffusers and sprays (it's a holistic calming solution for cats) for my cats and that helps with their stress levels. I know some people who tried feliway and said it didn't do a thing and some who think it helps, every cat is different and responds differently.

At my worst calorie talk could put me in a panic where I would obsess about calorie intake for weeks. OPs comments to the cousin would have made me defensive and anxious.

I have been doing zoom calls with my family to stay in touch and have had to gently ask my family to leave their weight watcher conversations for a time when I am not present because calorie talk is something I am still working through. I absolutely support them in their effort to eat healthy and balanced and under normal circumstances I can usually tune it out, but things are weird right now. Nearly all of my structure around food has changed because of the pandemic and even with 2 years of stability around food, 2 years is SMALL compared to the 15 years I have of extremely disordered eating.

Thankfully my family is very supportive and understanding so it isn't a huge deal to advocate for myself with them."
