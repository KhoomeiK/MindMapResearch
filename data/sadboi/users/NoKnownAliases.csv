By no means do you have to take my recommendation, but to dismiss advice because of what I presume is an attitude that yoga ""for women"" or ""weak"" just because you're ignorant to the benefits when *you're* the one asking for help on a fitness forum is just childish."
Fitness,fjnqomg,t1_fjnonzk,1583512698.0,"What are your goals? If purely for aesthetics, you could definitely cut more for definition. Losing another 3-5kg would better show the muscle you've developed underneath.  I'd focus on some dedicated core work and/or yoga in that time to round things out."

Anxiety,eywqyaf,t1_eywjurx,1567535866.0,"Unwanted is really up to you.  We try to focus to have conscious thought, but subconsciously thoughts will float to the surface.  Sometimes it's unwanted, and if an unwanted thought is coming up despite your best efforts, it's intrusive.  It's important that we don't judge the thoughts that bubble to the surface, ""Oh NO i thought about my ex again, that is NOT GOOD!"".  Doing so only brings your focus to the unwanted thought, and you punish yourself for having a thought that you ""shouldn't have"" (who defines this? thoughts in themselves aren't 'good' or 'bad""). It is important that we acknowledge and address the thoughts that come up, and let them and any associated feelings pass naturally.  

If you fight the current, you will surely tire and drown.  Instead, flow with the current and you will find yourself much calmer and with more energy."

If you're just speculating, isn't this a bit disingenuous to claim they are ""largely responsible""?"

Riot Games up to this point has literally only had the one game.  The game has always been free and the only microtransactions are cosmetics.  There are ""loot boxes"" with random chance cosmetic rewards, but nearly all cosmetics can also be bought outright."
