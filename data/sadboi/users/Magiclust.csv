ThickDick,fr5s01p,t1_fr4jwqn,1589913676.0,"Second and final part of my reply:
As you did not have a solid argument against that very personal choice, you came out with the arrogant assumption that they were the 'wrong' person, as if I just needed to find the 'right guy' to fall into his arms and finally 'recognize' monogamy as the only valid relationship, when I had myself attested that no matter how eligible nd interesting they were, I didn´t want that stifling model of relationship any more. It was never about me or them but the model itself, it´s petty per se, in its essence, but only those who have outgrown it can realize that, only those with enough perception can realize it´s something that does not depend on the people involved but on the model itself:-), but I guess that´s beyond your intellectual capacity.

Aw, and that last paragraph is the epitome of arrogance and naiveté, you become a sort of prophet and guarantee that I will find out 'one way or the other', which shows how fallacious your supposed arguments are!
I think any serious person will see that capacity to see different hues and subtle variations is not one of your qualities and you will probably lack it to the end of your life, since you refuse to open your petty mind to less limiting horizons:-) Have a nice day, I'm sure those who are truly in search of learning will check the links I've posted and see that I'm not trying to impose polyamory to anyone, as have made it clear from the outset it´s an alternative only feasible for those who have already attained that stage of their inner growth which need more inner space than the limits of monogamy, but those who feel happy enough with them should obviously stick to it, as it would be unhealthy and even dangerous to force themselves into something they are not ready for:-) So, instead of being judgmental and belittling of others, I prefer to use the expression 'to each its own' in a rather understanding way, when it comes to this sort of thing, since in these matters, what is really important is that people be truly happy and that only themselves can say if they are, not anyone else:-)."
ThickDick,fr5rx7t,t1_fr4jwqn,1589913639.0,"I'll have to divide my refutation to your blunders due to the character limit for each comment.
Part one:
A lot of fallacies in one bunch, well you're really into hegemonic discourse aren´t you? It seems you are the one who, quite incoherently, is trying to impose your views on others, as I have spoken of ALTERNATIVES from the very outset, whereas you blunder assumptions about relations which even the most basic principles of rhetoric can dismantle. By the way, I'm an apologist of polyamory in truly democratic societies, not of polygamy as practiced in patriarchal ones, but I've given links to some of these types of relationships just as examples of how even these highly repressive patriarchal societies have alternatives to monogamy
You wrote:
""To each his own, but by definition the word ""relationship"" is a state of organizing your life around being a couple with another person. You can attempt to redifine the word to your liking but that does not mean the vast majority of others are going to agree with you.""
My rebuke:
To each his own indeed, mediocre minds would not be able to aprehend the deeper meanings of relationship beyond social conventions, which any student of anthropology and sociology knows to vary from culture to culture, from time to time:-), even to date there being examples of societies which have their structure based on quite different parameters than the limited range of monogamy.
For the sake of education of those who read us, which is my main concern, and, in case you decide to go down from your hegemonic pedestal:) for your own good so you stand a chance of truly broadening your utterly limited cultural and philosophical horizons:
""A visual guide to non-monogamy around the world""
In this article you have an accessible intro to the many alternatives to monogamy in different cultures fortunately still practicing them, such as polyandry in Tibet and Nepal, polygamy amont the Maasai, in Central Asia (Kazhakstan being the example of decriminalization since 1998):
""The term for a man’s first wife is a baibishe, and his second or younger wife is a tokal; many tokals cannot be married by the state, so go to mullahs to receive an Islamic marriage. Some female lawmakers argue that if polygamy is voted into law, the constitution of Kazakhstan stresses equality between men and women…so polyandrous marriages may become more common. ..."" https://matadornetwork.com/life/non-monogamy-around-world/
Then,they show polyamory in the West, Polygamy in Kyrgyzstan, and its legalization in South Africa, and, in mainland China's Yunnan province, the lovely Mosuo 'zou hun' (walking marriage), a truly matriarchal society:
""Instead of traditional marriages, the Mosuo indicate interest, and a woman may give a man permission to visit her after dark. While sexual activities may happen with many partners, couples do not usually live together even when their relationships become longer-term; women remain with their family. Rather than caring for their specific offspring, men share responsibility for any children born to women in their own family."" 
https://matadornetwork.com/life/non-monogamy-around-world/
And, here in my homeland, Brazil, we've had our first polyamorous family legally recognized, a lovely triad: ""This unprecedented legal recognition affords them the same rights as a couple living in a civil union, like same-sex couples (same-sex marriage is not legal in Brazil)."" https://matadornetwork.com/life/non-monogamy-around-world/
And so on, of course there are many sociological and anthropological studies available, some for free download, all over the web but this is enough to show those who read us that there are indeed socially acceptable alternatives to monogamy who are and have been practiced for thousands of years by some societies, contrary to your arrogant assumptions:-). So, the one who wants people to forcibly agree with one´s opinions is actually you, not me, cause I'm not even making apology to the supremacy of polyamory, just showing it is a wise and healthy alternative to monogamy, whereas you try to impose it as the sole 'relationship' model, even trying to reduce the very meaning of the word to YOUR worldview, when in fact relationship, according to all good dictionaries, is a very broad concept, never being limited to the romantic aspect itself but including it, though not in the monogamic (and much less heteronormative) sense:
Definition of relationship, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary:
1: the state of being related or interrelated
studied the relationship between the variables
2: the relation connecting or binding participants in a relationship: such as
a: KINSHIP
b: a specific instance or type of kinship
3a: a state of affairs existing between those having relations or dealings
had a good relationship with his family
b: a romantic or passionate attachment""  
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/relationship
And, that 'pearl' of idiocy you spit out:
""Polyamory just means you like to fuck other people. 98.769% of us call that being single""
Oh NOT AT ALL, ignoramus, polyamory has been the study of sociologists and anthropologists a serious form of sexual-affective relationship, there being several examples of successful polyamorous families living and raising their children, both straight and lgbt! Polyamory, according to the families, may involve dating, engaging and finally marrying, exactly like monogamous marriages and one norm that pervades all types of polyamorous alternatives is that sincerity is a must, and any new relationship has to be approved by the other members of the family, if the dating period turns into an engagement and is bound to be sealed in marriage!
Again, for the sake of education, this is from Psychology Today, not any site, for that matter, so, the source is reliable and accessible at the same time, providing good quality information to educate the general public as it should be in these cases. It´s a brief introduction to an actually complex set of alternatives in polyamorous relations but good enough to give an overview of the basics of polyamorous commmitment:
""Four Types of Commitment in Polyamorous Relationships -
How polyamorists let each other know they are in it for the long haul.""
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-polyamorists-next-door/201610/four-types-commitment-in-polyamorous-relationships
For more on polyamory commitments I suggest here just a few readings on a vast spectrum of reliable works and articles:

COMMITMENT IN POLYAMORY By Elaine Cook

Another serious introductory article enlightening the public about the subject, which is truly impartial in the analysis of the many drawbacks polyamorists have to learn to grapple with, as in any relationship, but showing how it can and does work when taken seriously, as anything in life should:
""Polyamory Is Growing—And We Need To Get Serious About It""
written by Geoffrey Miller
https://quillette.com/2019/10/29/polyamory-is-growing-and-we-need-to-get-serious-about-it/
The author of the article has one of the most lucid appraisals on the subject, observing why there are indeed some cases of failed attempts at it, obviously for lack of laying the solid basis any relationship must have beforehand, and the first challenge is fighting the lack of social support systems (but we've seen that even that has been conquered in some examples, as in our lovely Brazilian triad, legal recognition!):
""Many people try open relationships without doing their research, and they often fail. Poly doesn’t have a civilizational support system yet. ...""
"" ... Other poly people do their research, read blogs and books, find like-minded friends and mentors, join poly networks, and practice their relationship skills. They often find that poly relationships offer the best of both worlds—the long-term loving commitment of pair bonds, plus the excitement of sexual variety, the charm of recreational intimacy, and the power of social networking through threesomes. ...""

Another fallacy you've arrogantly spat out:
""Monogamy is not responsible for any of the ills you list, poor mental health and being in a dysfunctional relationship is though."" Oh, so you say all he rife honor killings in Islamic societies are the product of mental health? LOL, that will certainly include millions around the world in their socities and through centuries, ludicrous obviously.

One more of your pathetic attempts at an argument:
"" If your reaction to monogamy was felling petty and stifled it was because you were doing it with the wrong person, it had nothing to do with monogamy itself. "" Well, you indeed think you are clairvoyant to assume the nature of the relationship or the people I was talking about! Well, for the record, they were indeed very eligible people, and just assuming they were wrong is the easy way out of the very fact that I explained that I didn´t want to limit myself to a monogamous relationship for the very nature of it, not the people who were trying to court me:-)"

ThickDick,fr1ab5a,t1_fr0t1i1,1589816185.0,"That´s your point of view, sorry. I mean alternatives cause I don´t believe there´s just one ideal relationship for all, since people are different and at different stages of inner growth. Even when I was still looking for relationships I declined some monogamous guys cause I had realized I had long outgrown it, monogamy simply felt petty and stifling and I would never relapse into it for anything:-). Monogamy's dark side is also responsible for many tragedies all over the world, possessiveness being the reason of many passionate killings, in some society they are still rife and some of their laws even undersign such honor killings, which, obviously, always fall on the weakest side of straight couples in such theocratic, patriarchal laws. However, even among gay males it is also the very cause of much violence and resentment.
And last, but not least, we polys don´t take lies, we have sincerity as one of the basis of relationships and mutual respect as the core of our life style, which, obviously, does not happen in most mono relations:-)

lotr,fqtq7wq,t1_fqtauig,1589643965.0,"I wish that were true, you'd be surprised how much Tolkien's work was downplayed at some university circles, and obviously many people have the prejudiced idea that it´s something only for kids, when it actually has many different layers, as all good fantasy does. And being from such  different cultures many times make people find it hard to appreciate fantasy based on other people´s native folklore and myths, I for one have always felt a deep attraction to Celtic and Norse mythology and later for the Ugro-finnic peoples too but some people have not interest in them whatsoever, which to me is obviously shocking:-).
And say this based on my own experience while taking different bachelor courses in two different universities here in Rio, federal and state ones, two of which I graduated and got my teaching license from, two other left incomplete and lots of shocking realizations about how scholars in Literature saw this genre back then.I even pleased when I see so many papers on magical fantasy nowadays at Academia.edu.com, it´s comforting to see the genre treated with more respect and not only Tolkien but other authors have often been the subject of such studies in some of these papers uploaded for free in that wonderful sites."
