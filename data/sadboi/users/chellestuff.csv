offmychest,fq8nzvw,t3_ghc5z5,1589170811.0,Im so sorry for your loss. Losing a mother is.. its like.. losing the part of you that always saw that unconditional love and comfort. My mom died from cancer too. That was 12 yrs ago. She still lives inside me even though shes physically gone. You have to keep her alive within you. It helps with the grieving process. It will take a very long time to heal. And try to remember the good things. Im sure she wants to see you smile.

BPD,flvz5re,t1_flut98i,1585535602.0,This is me! In the means of isolating myself during my 4 yr relationship and after break up. Ive been trying to get my identity back. Because when I am in a relationship I end up loving them more than myself and forgetting who I am. Please find hobbies and things you love doing and keep doing them. It will save you because in the end the people I loved most are the ones that taught me how to be alone unfortunately. And in the end you can only save yourself. Donâ€™t wait on anyone else. Good luckðŸ’•
BPD,flqozp4,t3_fqgai6,1585402335.0,"I just went through something similar to this and personally with me, I Have to talk to them in increments in order to still retain the control of my emotions. You have to do whatever to keep the peace within yourself. You have to keep moving on. You can talk to them, But it has to be by steps at your pace otherwise youâ€™re going to flare up your anxiety and stress. usually those feelings come with guilt that makes you feel like youâ€™re not good enough. Goodluck"
BPD,fjxtq9l,t3_ffancw,1583683128.0,"I have bpd. I think we have a hyper aware system in our brains. We are robots, in a bittersweet way. Due to our trauma, we have reflected so so much. To a certain extent , we dont want other people to feel the way we do. But yet, we accommodate for the pain the nonBPD people feel so we learn to be better people. As someone who has accepted these terms ingrained into my brain and constantly regulating my emotions to stay in control, to not drown - i am a machine that will unfortunately will feel more than the average human being, that i cannot expect them to feel the intensity that i feel. They do not feel the rain like i do.."
BPD,fie0q7l,t1_fickxcv,1582373692.0,"Youre okay, i understand youre not attacking me. I   Use CBD oil (my mood stabilizer), Excerise. And eating healthy and trying to have a set sleep schedule. In all while being sober. (While all the rest of these are also mood stabilizers)

For me, i refuse to use medications at this point because im trying to find every other resource to help me instead of pills. And it is indeed helping and i can feel progression, that was why i was trying explain my struggle. But like you said, if you are at your wits end , what do you do? 

Ive made a strategical and disiplined routine to untrain some parts of my brain that were bad for my moods and lifestyle while training other parts of my brain that would be healthy for my lifestyle. I feel like pills that are for anxiety and  depression make me feel numb. So again , FOR ME, i want to feel present and face problems upfront rather than before i felt like i was most of the time hiding and being numb. Felt like a robot."
BPD,ficfr76,t3_f7dula,1582345817.0,"Ugh! I dont trust pharmaceutical meds. There isnt medication for BPD. But there is medications that are prescribed for anxiety and depression, although, BPD is a personality disorder, not a chemical imbalance. It is ingrained in our brains on how we work. I was diagnosed with BPD 4 years ago and here within the past six months ive had several traumatic events and its just, i hate I HATE feeling like this. My heart is soft but my mind convinces me like its on my team but then betrays me - especially at my most vulnerable raw moments. I have very low emotional support team. And im living on my own. And just trying, trying to be okay. From my experience so far within this journey what has helped me is..

-being sober with weed AND alcohol (been 34 days sober so far) im not going to be sober forever but i just know any of that will emphasis my sadness and the darkness. And Iâ€™m not gonna do it until I know Im capable to control it.

-exercise , scientifically - when we exercise , It releases natural endorphins. Those endorphins are really good for our brain work. Read into it. The way we eat and sleep can really subject to our moods. I dont have as many night terrors bc im physically exhausting myself before i go to bed so i can sleep.

-keeping busy, I work 40 hours or more a week so that helps me stay busy and distracted from being inside my head. And what I do as a career actually helps because Iâ€™m constantly fixing things at my bench that are very meticulous so itâ€™s a lot of self satisfactory when I Have a project thatâ€™s broken and then I fix it and then in my brain I feel like Iâ€™ve accomplished something as if I feel useful and valuable to something.

-I take CBD oil. CBD oil is really forgiving for our BPD. The CBD oil helps control the body and your heart rate when you canâ€™t control it yourself. People think CBD oil is like getting high but itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s like, do you know when youâ€™re having a Severe manic episode, your heart is pumping so hard it feels like itâ€™s coming out of your chest, the walls feel like theyâ€™re closing in on you, and start panicking and it feels like your mind is your enemy and you donâ€™t know where to go-Well when I take CBD oil it helps control those episodes and I tell you what, it has literally saved my life.

Because when it comes down to it. No matter how much I try to accommodate for other peopleâ€™s lack of, or try to please everybody around me, or trying to help constantly because it makes me feel better makes me feel good, let alone try to act obedient and behave so Iâ€™m not a burden to others or discomfort the people around me. Itâ€™s the fact that when it comes down to it YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN SAVE YOURSELF. The past two months I had to find another therapist because my insurance switched over to another insurance and itâ€™s been a living hell. I have contacted 22 therapists that are under my new insurance and they are either not contacting me back or not seeing new clients. But now I have to pay a BPD therapist out of network that is costing me $120 per session. And with BPD therapists they recommend weekly sessions. So itâ€™s costing me 500 bucks out of pocket per month to just try to get better. And Iâ€™m trying so hard. I bought books On BPD. And Workbooks that are given out in dialectical behavioral therapy group sessions. Im part of psychology bpd podcast. Watching countless videos of Mel Robbins on youtube. Practicing mindfulness. Im just trying to find every resource that could help improve who i am, and the monster that hides within me. And Iâ€™m sorry that I feel like I wrote a novel as a response But Iâ€™m just trying to help because BPD itâ€™s so awful and heart wrenching. Itâ€™s so hard to live in our skin. Especially when you feel so alone. While still behaving and playing by the rules. Dont make excuses, we have a high pain tolerance. You can take it. You got this."
