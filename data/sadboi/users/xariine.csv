>  
>So I sit here at home, alone. Crying about all the things that hurt but having no one to talk to.""

I felt that in my soul. It took me so long to see my worth, because I've always been the healer for my friends and family. I've consistently sacrificed my comfort and happiness to mend the broken people around me-- so much that now I'm broken beyond repair. I crave love and attention like nothing else, I crave someone to heal me the way I've healed others.  But as soon as the people around me have healed, I'm abandoned once again. I'm just someone else to use and leave.

I hope for us that we can both heal. This pain won't be permanent. If you ever want to talk, please don't hesitate to reach out. We don't have do go through this alone. <3"

For me, I get ""It's going to make me too tired after and there's things I still wanted to do"" when I'm practically begging for it (and am actually in the mood). So, he tells me to ""be patient"" and it never happens- day after day after day after day. Plus, after that happens I feel so bad about myself that I can't even get turned on anymore.

The lack of physical connection is destroying our emotional bond and he doesn't see it. That seems to come last these days, yet he won't waste a second ogling over other women. Feels bad.

Hope things get better for you and I both, friend. :("

AskRetail,fiw1viz,t3_f33m30,1582773168.0,"Depends on what you're managing and who the GM is. When I was a manager, my schedule was pretty consistently 8-5, of course with a closing/mid rotation. 50 hours a week, shifts were 10 hours every day, but I was salaried so I lived at my store."

I know the change may seem daunting, but if you maintain the same level of motivation and work with your new team, you will get there. I was in a similar situation, but the new store was a smaller struggling store with *less* staff. I spent a lot of time out of my office, which was extremely hard with having a lot of desk work, but the involvement made all the difference. Stay motivated and you can't lose :)"
AskRetail,fiw0c3w,t3_fa50vr,1582772142.0,"Never worked at Ross, but was in fashion retail elsewhere as hiring manager. Something tells me they probably don't frisk you. That sounds like a company asking for legal trouble lol. We were scared to even do random bag checks on employees for that reason, unless there was proof of theft.

Scheduling is always clunky when first hired on. For me, for example, this week's schedule would have been written, finalized and published in our system 2 weeks ago. Adding/changing the schedule can be problematic due to store budgeting, so they are probably going to play it by ear with you if they go by a similar system. On the plus side, if that is the case, you'll probably see way more hours on the newest schedule (for however many weeks out they generate it).

Congrats on your new gig, if you have questions I've got 10 years under my belt and would be glad to help! Having first day anxiety is totally fine, make sure to ask for help when it's needed and never feel like your questions or ideas are stupid. You got this 👍"

He, even when we dont have sex, wants to cuddle all night long and will tell me he loves me and things like that.. but my confidence has taken a major hit because it's a rarity at this point that I get sexual, physical attention. 

Don't get me wrong, i love him, but i just think i have very high libido (and hormone imbalances, so it's extra crazy) and maybe he has lower libido? It just makes me wonder what happened and I don't want to hurt his feelings or make him feel humiliated by asking."

I called my best friend from home on the drive back from work yesterday and sobbed for 30 minutes about how awful I felt and they really helped calm me down and let me know I am loved, and worthwhile. All I want is respect, too. At the end of the day I just want him to put in as much emotional effort as I do.

It's been hard to accept that it isn't me when my only supporter is telling me it's all on me, all my fault, and that I'm unlovable and he gives up on me. Told me to go to hell, called me all sorts of names. I'm far from perfect and I know that, and im seeking help to get better, but he isn't doing the same.

ptsd,esfm1zv,t3_c7fqs8,1561929466.0,"The way you wrote this post is absolutely beautiful.. though, what we feel isn't. Sometimes the world feels so lonely because of the fear that trauma left with me. Little things on TV/film, certain things people say, interactions at work or in public. Some days it is horrifying to step out of the house. Some days it is horrifying being inside. Some days it's work. Seeing a friend. Visiting family. You never know which part of it is going to set you off. 

Exposure is what people keep screaming at me, but there's only so many times over 15 years that I can expose myself to my triggers before I give up on getting better.  Not saying I HAVE given up, it's just so.. tiring. I just want there to be an end in sight.

I never speak about my problems to anyone anymore. I go about life as ""normally"" as I can because I'm tired of being a victim. But what hurts more than all of it is I know on the outside I'm not a victim, but I've got so much pain in my body and so much darkness in my subconscious that I feel like I'm abusing myself.


I know you said you don't want support, and I say that a lot too. So I just want you to know that while our experiences in life are probably a bit different, I know a similar pain and heartache and you are not alone."
