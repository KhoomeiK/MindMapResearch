I learned to not fear bad trips at all anymore because any negativity that I experience during a trip contains a lesson, unless I'm tripping in dangerous or unpredictable environments in which case the lesson is don't do that, and I already know that one. Tripping by myself or in a safe environment with safe people means that if I start having a bad time, I'm safe to explore what's going on there."
datingoverthirty,fqqkc7f,t1_fqq91av,1589567031.0,"> They're like that perfect family out of a TV sitcom

This is maybe a little bit odd to say, but families can be too perfect. Not in the sense of I'm trying to say there's something we don't know, but in the sense of, if everything is literally perfect it can almost have like a coddling effect. The baby bird doesn't ever have any reason to want to leave the warm toasty nest with the perfect parents where everything is always daisies and lollipops. If they don't push her to be independent by pulling back on how much they take care of her, everything else (including romantic relationships) is going to pale in comparison to that. As we become adults, our parents are supposed to sort of shift into being on an equal level with us instead of continuing to parent us and care for us like we're children, or where is the motivation to go live our own lives?

Obviously that's a ton of speculation but just from the comments I've read, it sounds like maybe her life is a little too easy and she might not be ready to be an actual grown up with you. Having safety nets that velvety and comfortable and inviting can almost be like a trap because any time real life gets hard you just go home and cuddle up with mom. If this seems way off disregard it but maybe something to think about."

I don't think this is necessarily about how much time has passed or needs to pass, this sounds like an issue with her that may or may not go away. For some people being enmeshed with your family is normal, but usually those people tend to make good romantic partners for other people that are the same way so this stuff doesn't seem so weird. If you don't have the same kind of relationship with your family this could potentially be a major compatibility issue. On the other hand if you and her have **very** good communication, this could potentially be worked through. Personally I can't be romantically involved with people like this, friendship is great though!"

As they get older they may often feel like it's too late to learn new things, and employers may be prejudiced against hiring them due to ageism.

Psychonaut,fqmxvwo,t3_gjjjso,1589485359.0,"Weed is absolutely a psychedelic and one that I think we really disrespect. If psychedelics are all teachers, weed is the class where we go and fuck around with our friends the entire time and throw paper airplanes and just never listen. We smoke way too much when the sweet spot is probably 3 bowls ago, develop tolerances to it which don't allow us to experience it in its full complexity. We don't listen to what it tries to teach us because it gets introduced to most of us as a way to relax, unwind, basically NOT do any work. But a drug that makes you paranoid or gives you anxiety is doing you the favor of showing you where there is so much work to be done. A drug that amplifies the negativity inside your head is like saying ""hey bro, noticed you've been ignoring this festering pile of shit here in your brain. It's actually starting to grow and fuck things up, we gotta do something about this"" and mostly we just smoke another bowl, turn up the music, do other drugs to pump up the happy and shut up the teacher. 

I've known several people who have been regular smokers since their teens/early 20s who start getting major anxiety from it in their 30s and end up stopping. I think this is weed losing its fucking cool with our disrespect, grabbing us by our faces and looking us dead in the eyes and saying ""It's time to fucking learn or drop my class motherfucker, but you're not going to come in here and fuck around anymore, we're done with that."" I've started writing when I smoke and I get anxiety instead of trying to drown it out or ""fix"" it because I don't want to have to give it up. I want to learn. I want to clean up the piles of shit inside my head. I believe every psychedelic will turn on you if you abuse it, and the way most of us show absolutely no respect to weed as a psychedelic and a teacher leads to it turning on us at some point. It doesn't let us ignore the piles of shit in our heads anymore, we smoke it and we just get sat down in front of a big screen with our eyes held open clockwork orange style and that shit we've been using weed to avoid is on the screen and we have to stare at it and deal with it, or stop smoking because play time is over baby."

This helps break that barrier between inside and outside that can feel hard to cross when you've been inside for too long. It can also remind you that outside is inviting and nice. The air smells good. Children are playing, etc. You'll also hear sirens and stuff, but it is all part of the world that's still happening out there. It's basically slowly breaking the insulated world we've all been forced into that isn't good for us for too long.

The easily addressed issue is that I think we've just plain outgrown the whole ""everything on nosleep is real"" thing. I was never a huge fan of it but it was kind of fun when nosleep wasn't a vastly popular established scary story subreddit. Before it became a default for a while. Now it's just an annoying roadblock when it comes to community engagement. We are only allowed to engage with the story if we play along with the ghost story but it's kind of like we're all pretending santa is real for a child that doesn't even exist. Who is the child? Who's suspension of disbelief is being ruined by someone not staying ""in character"" in the comments section of a subreddit that is a massive draw for writers looking for fans and fans looking for content? Which leads me to the other point...

Nosleep feels like a marketplace now. Writers setting up stalls and advertising their wares. Always letting you know at the end where to get more, where to support them. I know this is a touchy subject and I hesitate to even call it a problem because this is the natural evolution of a subreddit who's mods made the decision to go supermassive by becoming a default when they did, but before that happened the *feel* of the subreddit was that the stories being posted here were being posted because the writer wanted to scare the piss out of you. Like that was the ultimate goal. When there are links and stuff at the end, the messaging gets a little skewed and it starts to feel like they are trying to scare the piss out of you so you'll come to them for more of that sweet fear, but it does change the feel, it feels transactional. Like a marketplace. With wares. I don't suggest authors stop doing this and I don't know of a solution. Almost nobody ever used to come here with the idea of building a social media following though, or making any money. So the feeling that nosleep had when I first started reading it was kind of like, a bunch of people who love to be scared getting together and hanging out and being like ""show me what you got"" and *sharing* with each other, and over time it became like going to a scare mall and walking through and having a bunch of people at kiosks running up and begging you to check out what they have to offer. You end up ignoring most of it. I don't blame authors for this, I blame capitalism, but the effect is the same regardless of where the blame lies."

CPTSDmemes,fnfb87k,t1_fnf7pxu,1586904793.0,"I like the way you explained that. I kind of had the same evolution in how I feel about the word toxic. I hated it for a while because I hated seeing it be used as an excuse to throw entire people in the trash. ""Toxic individuals"" etc. Then I realized we still need a way to identify situations and dynamics that are harmful to us. Labeling people as toxic leads us to solve the problem by throwing the person away, but when we shift to labeling situations as toxic we empower ourselves to fix the situations by removing ourselves from them without having to throw anyone in the trash. And we empower ourselves to avoid similar dynamics in the future instead of trying to defend ourselves from all these ""toxic"" people out there trying to get us. That just leads to a constantly triggered, unsafe emotional state. That's basically what cptsd is."

askphilosophy,fn4c5te,t1_fn3vri1,1586638354.0,"Of course thinking for yourself exists. But if you can't read philosophical texts without being so influenced by them that you find yourself unable to come up with original ideas then you might be approaching them the wrong way. You may need to hone your critical thinking/logic skills. You should be reading not to be influenced by them, but to pick them apart. Philosophy should be expanding your mind and making it bloom with more original ideas than you were able to come up with before reading a piece of text. Developing an extremely critical mind will free you to feel the desire to dive in to what others have to say without the worry that it will influence you or stifle your creative thought process. Think of reading the texts like having conversations, or debates. I'm going to guess that you haven't taken many philosophy courses but that's the key difference in learning philosophy as compared to learning about other subjects. It's not about learning and accepting big ideas, it's about looking for the flaws. Exercising your critical thinking. That is what philosophy is. No original thinker should ever stop any buck. I'm not even sure what that could mean, or how it could ever be good."
askphilosophy,fn3t7qu,t1_fn3mrgn,1586627444.0,"You almost seem to be implying that your pure thought exists in a vacuum and that reading the relevant text would sully that, but your thoughts free from historic philosophical context just come from everything else being put in your head by the society that you live in and every other type of media that you're consuming. So to have all that in there and then avoid the specific literature that would be the most relevant would not likely result in pure and original free thinking, but ideas and arguments informed by everything around you **but** the texts that would address the flaws in your arguments. There is no purity."

EDAnonymous,fmwafd6,t3_fxfymx,1586442876.0,"This is the reason I think communities like this one are important. I have BED and I have felt incredibly shamed by the fat positive and anti-diet culture communities. Which really sucks because the anti-diet culture people in particular tend to align with me about most other things so I will see triggering things from people I am following for unrelated stuff occasionally. 

I've seen stuff that implies that BED doesn't exist. I've seen a lot of people say stuff along the lines of, you only ever want to binge eat because you've been starving yourself and it's your body's natural reaction to not eating enough. Okay? It's fun because it's also another example of erasure of the effects of growing up in poverty which I have to deal with constantly already, and these are usually people who are very socially aware, or try to be. And then they are almost never open to me explaining how growing up not always having enough to eat and having all these  memories of having to steal food or money to buy food or eating weird expired shit out of my cupboard because my mom was catatonic for the 5th day in a row might make you want to shovel down everything you can occasionally later in life and it has nothing to do with starving myself or my weight at all.

Or people will say that the only reason you wouldn't want to binge in the first place is because you're afraid of getting fat and that's fatphobia. And again I think, you have no idea what BED is like if you think the only reason for wanting to avoid that compulsive eating until you're in pain and the often days of resulting gastrointestinal problems and the shame that comes with feeling like you have no control of yourself at all. If you want to boil that entire thing down to me just being afraid of being fat, fuck you honestly. Sometimes they make everything about THEM and THEIR bodies and THEIR own issues and it seems really self involved after a certain point. Because at this point in my life I'm mostly at peace with my body. And I'm so sick of my issues that stem from childhood trauma and poverty and neglect and things that are very complicated being simplified down to ""these wouldn't be problems if you didn't hate yourself/fat people."" It's fucking insulting."

TLCsisterwives,fmqpc7u,t1_fmpqy47,1586304199.0,"Here's how it could/would be good: she decides to leave and tells them and they immediately start filming. They film her the whole time without doing season breaks, documentary style over the entire 2 or 3 years probably that it takes for her to separate, extricate herself, establish herself elsewhere, and really settle in. Edit the entire thing down to a mini series. ""Meri breaks free"" or whatever you want to call it. That way it's not some  meandering endless storyline following boring people doing nothing, there's a story. They won't have to make up anything, they'll have so much actual content to condense down into 1 seasons worth of episodes that it could be like an actual docuseries. We could have conflict and resolution. None of this will happen of course because TLC isn't trying to produce quality content, but god it could be genuinely really good. Not edited together well, but like a well told story. 

Whether we ever get to see something like that or not, after this latest episode I am just fully hoping Meri finds the way to be happy, because Kody is a real piece of shit."
nosurf,fmq2i1l,t1_fmpoxkn,1586291681.0,"I interpreted OP a little differently. I took it more as curating your feeds and developing new habits so you don't constantly have to try to make these decisions and deal with decision fatigue as badly. Like the choice is about choosing to set up those road blocks in the first place. I am mindful of what sucks me into scrolling forever on facebook so I alter facebook. That's the choice I'm making. I realized all the groups I'm in defaulted to notifying me all the time so I turned off notifications. I recognized certain subreddits sucked me into 1000+ comment threads and the threads put me in a bad mood so I unsubbed. I am always ""customizing in search of what I truly value"""

Psychonaut,fmpw6qn,t1_fmprda9,1586288450.0,Having a panic attack during a bad trip was how I learned to deal with panic attacks. Obviously that's not a universal experience or reaction but having bad experiences on psychedelics for me ends up being the best time because my brain is primed to find novel ways to deal with it that my sober mind can't.
Psychonaut,fmo6ttq,t3_fv3cuf,1586247534.0,I have a disorder that causes me to dissociate a lot and I'm pretty sure I also experienced ego death recently on nitrous and they're not similar. Idk if it was ego death though. I'm trying to figure out what happened to me but the best way I can explain it is my entire sense of reality got pulled out through my asshole and nothing is the same anymore. I came out of the trip screaming. If that's what ego death is I think a lot of people are calling a lot smaller experiences ego death so I understand your confusion.

And it's 100% because of the assumption that we all have our phones right in front of our faces at all times and probably have notifications on for all these social media apps. I remember even when instant messaging started becoming a popular thing, I immediately started getting anxiety from it because I really can't stand the idea that me not responding to someone is interpreted as ignoring them instead of me just doing other things. Instant messaging started it for me and then with smart phones it just became normalized but it always gave me anxiety, that idea that I'm always on call to whoever has my number/social media."

I want to get some Hanes as well. Every time I've tried to get any women's specific items to fill this spot in my wardrobe they have the exact issues that I have been avoiding by switching to men's boxer briefs in the first place. Either the legs are too short and they still end up riding up my ass (like booty shorts or ""boy shorts"") or else the material is flimsy and worthless or they are incredibly expensive or usually a combination of all of these things.

When I was on tret my skin was a mess if I didn't physically exfoliate the dead skin flakes off. I would get cystic acne, and it just generally looked incredibly dull. I was super gentle and used one of my older salux cloths (older = not as rough) but it worked great at making my face smooth again. Then I'd just go extra with the hydration+moisturization."

These types of sprays will make that problem worse if anything. My skin tends to suck all the moisture out of my makeup so these work great for freshening it up when it's dry halfway through the day."
