my mom comments on how bony I've gotten but literally there is no bones visible! I don't get it, but I wish I did so I could finally be satisfied and see results :/"
EatingDisorders,flv5f3l,t3_frbz5f,1585516743.0,"First of, thank you for trying to understand her and her struggles! It can be difficult for all parts involved in a situation like this so be sure you have someone to vent or talk to if you feel like you're ending up carrying all of her problems as well as your own. 

I am in a very similar situation only with the roles reversed, I am the gf and my bf is trying to understand me and my illness. Know that everyone is different, but from what I've gathered from the past week of my partner knowing about my ED (eating disorder) is that he needs to realize that I need to be the one who wants to change. If I am not in the mindset of trying to recover, I will only relapse and dig myself deeper than I already am. I don't know how you're responding to her or how much she's sharing, but I can understand how hard it can be to hear a loved one talk about how they're hurting themselves. My partner cant fathom how for example I can't stop eating once I'm full, and he'll end up just telling me very straight forward to just stop once I feel good. But it doesn't work like that, if it did I wouldn't have this problem to begin with. Realize that we have weird and unreasonable fears, don't support her disordered behaviors, but still encourage her recovery. Maybe ask her if she wants you to be strict with her or if she just needs comfort when things get tough. People recover differently. 
I've learned that most of us know we are sick and we know we are hurting ourselves, but the illness and fear is so ingrained that it drowns out any reasonable thoughts we have.

Idk if this was to any help, but if you have any concrete questions I'd be happy to answer!"

I couldn't seem to find any answers on it so I searched the same url but I changed the, .no (Norwegian) to either .se or .DK (swedish and Danish) to se if I would get the same page but written in either of those languages. Nope, I got boobs and moaning women and my teacher was livid."

curlyhair,f6p6jbw,t3_dsgfc0,1573048826.0,"My routine: I wash with Godiva shampoobar (I'm still not completely sure about this one but it gets the job done lol) from Lush maybe once a week (depending on my activity level and how hot it is) I mostly consentrate it in my ends and not my roots. 
I condition either with American Cream or Candy Rain (both from lush and I switch depending on what I want to smell like) i distribute it from my tips and and upwards. whatever is left I rub wherever I feel needs a little more moisture. I leave it in while I do my other shower business and rinse out last thing before I'm done.
I scrunch my hair dry with a towel and put in Biosilk Silk Therapy oil or Lush's leave in conditioner R&B.
I just bought Maroccan Oil's curl defining cream that I've found does a good job for me. One pump is enough for my hair length and I scrunch it in having my hair flipped upside down.
After all this I  leave it to air dry :)

On the days I'm not using shampoo I shower in the morning and just make my hair wet and I do the steps I listed above outside of the shower.

I hope this makes sense haha
 I'm still on the lookout for something that can help me kepe my hair less frizzy when I go outside as the products I use don't protect too much against the elements hehe"

relationship_advice,epl0gvq,t1_epl0595,1559284890.0,"I probably worded myself badly, sorry about that. What I meant was he shouldn’t bring it up with her because the old FWB isn’t involved in her life as a FWB anymore. So he should only bring it up if he suspects (which I didn’t think he did from how he phrased his question) that she is cheating or anything of the sort."
relationship_advice,epix2o1,t3_bux5ur,1559244178.0,"I’m a pretty curious person by nature and I catch myself wondering about stuff about my partner that I’d be better off not knowing. I’d drop it, unless you have any suspicion of her still seeing him (but from how you angled this I don’t thing you have any suspicions?)
On how to stop thinking about it, I’m not too sure (I’m open for suggestions as well as I often find myself in situations like this hehe) I usually try and distract myself if I catch myself wondering about something that’s (in theory) none of my business as it doesn’t effect me. Watching shows, I’ve found that just chatting/hanging out with friends help a great deal, cooking, any other hobbies you have. Just distance yourself from the thought and try to teach yourself that you shouldn’t worry about it before it becomes a relevant issue in your relationship. 
I hope this helps :)"
