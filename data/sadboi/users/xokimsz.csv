CPA,fel9w0n,t1_fek3je1,1579217246.0,Honestly the MCQs weren’t that scary. I’ve seen a few posts recently saying the exam MCQs were easier than Becker but the exam Sims were way tougher than Becker and I agree. April is a lot of time to go. Hopefully your busy season isn’t so bad and you get a lot of studying in!
CPA,fel93e2,t1_fek6qyd,1579216737.0,"Ah try not to think of it like that. Keep studying for FAR like you’re gonna take it on the 6th. No matter what happens with AUD, some of that FAR material will stick and even if you have to push it (hopefully not though!) you’ll have less to learn from scratch."
CPA,fel8gex,t1_fejui50,1579216327.0,"Ugh, sucks that we put ourselves in this spot but you still have time to get in a lot more studying! Just keep up at it, the feeling of it possibly being over is 🙌🏾"
CPA,exvsks8,t3_cukw96,1566605761.0,In December when I sat BEC in Tampa the power went out and we were escorted out of the room. But power came back a few (tearful lol) minutes later and I was able to put in my code and pick up where I left off. Hopefully this is the case for you!! 🤞🏾
