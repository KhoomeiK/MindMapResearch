NarcissisticAbuse,fozoyz1,t3_gae99r,1588194336.0,"Congrats on your freedom! You totally did the right thing and did what you had to do to protect yourself and your child. I know things are probably feeling a bit overwhelming right now, but it does get better. Think of your empty apartment as a clean slate that you can fill with YOUR things and place them where YOU want them. When you have accomplished that, you will look around and feel soooo proud of yourself. It really is an amazing, peaceful, and validating experience.

Here are some places that I went to and sites I found useful when I first moved away from my narc and had an empty apartment (these are all in the US, so if you live in another country just Google these and see if there are companies similar where you are located):

1. Rooms to Go- you can order online, pick and choose pieces from different collections (I did this and even impressed the sales guy helping me!), financing is super easy and VERY flexible monthly payments, they will deliver and assemble the furniture for you. 

2. Bed Bath & Beyond- order online and free delivery on most stuff, if not everything. All your household needs in one place. I didn‚Äôt even own silverware when I left and didn‚Äôt realize it until I got to my new apartment. I have to admit that I did have a small meltdown when I realized how little I did have at the time, but I made a list of what I needed and prioritized the stuff I would need immediately and the other things I would need later. 

3. Amazon- if you don‚Äôt have an Amazon Prime account, I highly recommend getting one. They will do payment plans for the membership fees if you can‚Äôt pay for the yearly subscription up front. A majority of the items are free delivery and some of the stuff you can get the same day. During this Covid lockdown they have been saying it will take longer to get things, but everything I have ordered from them the past month has been delivered earlier than first promised. You can even buy groceries on there now and it might be easier than taking your kid into a store at the moment.

4. Ehow.com- this website tells you pretty much how to do anything from assembling furniture to fixing a broken part on your car!  This helped me do so many things by myself because I didn‚Äôt have anyone to even help me hang a picture. 

I hope this list helps you at least get started and feel a little less overwhelmed with your new life. The urge to reach out to your narc will be so strong at first, but once you get started designing your new life without their constant belittling is just do amazing that words cannot describe the feeling except peaceful. Right now is the time for you to focus on yourself and deprogramming all the narc crap going on in your head. You will find new friends soon, but it will take time to find ones that you can trust. It is ok to be picky about who is in your circle!

Good luck and stay safe!"

CPTSD,fmadwhh,t3_ftyv4m,1585891005.0,It helps to wear a rubber band around your wrist and snap it when you start having a flashback.

My theory is that it is because I was pretty much forced to get a job at a grocery store at the height of my childhood/adolescent traumatization. I worked there for 6 years and went through some of my toughest times during that period, but I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten through all that if it weren‚Äôt for my amazing co-workers who encouraged and validated the abuse I was going through. I accomplished some amazing things in my life because of those ladies who believed in me, but I still just cannot stand going into a grocery store to this day."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fmacb7u,t3_ftz2qg,1585889626.0,"I remember driving away from my narc cousin‚Äôs house I was living in with all the stuff I could cram into my little Toyota the night I moved out and went total N/C and having the words ‚Äúsoul rape‚Äù pop into my head. I felt like I had been touched by literally Evil itself and had my soul just completely ripped from my body. I spent almost 13 years only seeing the good in her and her psychopath hubby. It felt like I had sold my soul to the devil to please these two master manipulators and I still don‚Äôt understand why 4 years and 3 months later.

I have come to realize that I will never, EVER be the same person I was prior to 2003.  Even though I have accepted that fact, the hardest part of my post-narc journey has been the fact that my old friends and family members expect me to be that person I was before. Unfortunately, ‚Äúshe‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. I have been grieving her loss for 4 years, but I LOVE the new and improved person I have become. I am longer a people-pleaser and I maintain my boundaries because my peace of mind is worth more than a relationship with anyone (friends or family) who cannot love me just the way I AM now.  

One day you will get to that point and find your soul again, but it will be a stronger and MUCH smarter one than before. Be patient with yourself and do whatever the f*** it is to make YOU happy and whole again!"
CPTSD,fm8iwk9,t1_fm89t43,1585850207.0,"Me too! I remember my initial session and how I could barely even talk about my traumatic experience that brought me there. Every single muscle in my body was so tight, my shoulders were hiked up to my chin, and I could not uncross my arms from around my waist to save my life. My mouth was like the Sahara desert and I felt like the words weren‚Äôt making sense when I spoke. By the time I had my final session 4 months later I could FINALLY talk about my abuse coherently and soothe myself whenever I was triggered outside my therapist‚Äôs office.

I also found out a couple months after my last session that somehow my crippling fear of heights was gone too! We had never even touched on that subject, but I guess somehow that fear must have been linked to my CPTSD."
CPTSD,fm7nv76,t1_fm78q8q,1585832665.0,Thanks! I had been looking for a therapist again right before all the quarantine/stay at home orders started so i just really thought about the steps I go through to find one. The first one I had unfortunately retired and I moved to a different state so I had to stop seeing the second one. She did offer teletherapy and EMDR over Skype but I just don‚Äôt feel like it works for me unless I have sessions in person.
CPTSD,fm6zsc7,t3_ftfk5m,1585808283.0,"DEFINITELY get a new therapist and I wouldn‚Äôt go to one she referred to you. There are some amazing ones out there for PTSD, but it takes a little work to find the right one. I went through my insurance provider list and Googled all of the in-network providers to see their reviews online. If they didn‚Äôt have any, had low ratings, or the reviews were all old then I went to the next name on the list. I also checked out any websites the providers had and scoped out any social media links they had on their page. In a way it almost felt like pseudo stalking, but I refused to put what was left of my fragile sanity into incapable hands. I also did not want to have to keep repeating my story because I felt I was re-traumatizing myself every time I had to tell it.

Things I looked for on social media sites:
1. Helpful or positive posts about trauma/PTSD
2. See if the therapist actually interacts with people who comment.
3. Former/ Current patient reviews (see paragraph above)
4. This may sound weird, but just study their photo to see if you could envision yourself comfortable with that person. I try to look for women (I am a 45yo female) who are around my age or older because I think they have had more life experiences to understand my situation. I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable trying to explain my trauma with a 24 year old fresh out of school who looks at me weird because I never married or had any kids. I also avoid males because most of my trauma is due to sexual abuse and manipulation.
5. If they are religious based or not. Some therapists will try to shove religion down your throat and I don‚Äôt feel that really helps with the shame most people feel with abuse/PTSD. It can help if they are open minded and religious, but just be cautious of ones who use only religious based treatments. I am a Christian, but I can‚Äôt stand it when I am preached to and told to just pray my issues away.
6. What kind of modalities they use-talk therapy, EMDR, CBT, etc. I found that EMDR was the most helpful to relieve my PTSD symptoms. 

I have had two amazing therapists that have done wonders for me and one that just didn‚Äôt get it. Even though I only had a few sessions with her, it was wasted time and money and re-traumatizing that ended up being more harmful than helpful.

I hope you find a great therapist that actually helps you instead of causing more pain soon!"

I just knew I had to go away to school right away after graduation or I was going to be stuck living the same kind of life as everyone in my family had before me.

Whenever i talked about going away to school my family either laughed at me or stared at me like I had 2 heads. But I did it and am soooo glad I stuck to my guns back then! My bit of advice is to keep your eye on the prize and do whatever you can to go to college - the farther away from the naysayers the better.

adderall,fkl7678,t1_fkbd3ih,1584299971.0,"I was prescribed Wellbutrin in my mid-20s for depression and ADHD and i had rage fits the first few months of taking it and it was the only medication I was on at the time. It was sooooo out of character for me to explode like that and over the dumbest things, too. After 4 months I noticed that the rages/temper tantrum urge went away, though. 

I took it for about a year and a half and went back on adderall for a while. Never had a rage event again. A few years later one of my coworkers had gone on Wellbutrin to quit smoking and the same exact thing happened to him! He kept going off on everyone at work like a month into taking it and I couldn‚Äôt help but see the similarities in when the rages started. 

I think the rages/temper tantrums are a side effect of the Wellbutrin, but i never saw it on the list of side effects back then (2000-2004)."

Unfortunately being passed over for a role is sometimes a blessing and it just might be in this case. You had an awesome first experience doing what you love and you should pursue that same experience again. This other director sounds absolutely toxic and you may have dodged a bullet by not having to work under him for weeks/months. Being exposed to that toxicity could undo all of the progress you made with your positive first experience. Just be patient and keep in touch with your cast/crew from the play you were in.

Not only was the narc totally obsessed with her looks and trying to look/act younger, she would do the whole insult me and then soothe me right after. Can you say Trauma Bond???? And I went through the same exact thing Rapunzel did when she escaped with the emotional roller coaster and i tear up every time I see that part because that. Was. Me.

I was so proud of myself for getting out of an emotionally abusive family dynamic and talking about the changes i was making and her response was ‚Äúwhat happens when the newness wears off?‚Äù I realized then that she would never be supportive of me in this new life because she loves to wallow in her own pity and wanted me to stay that way too.

It has happened with men and women even though i have always been a straight female who has never even shown an interest in ‚Äúplaying for the other team‚Äù or being bi-curious. 

I have always thought it was odd that these people would start assuming we had something going or in a relationship with them just because i was nice to them. If it had maybe happened once or twice i would have thought it was a fluke, but it has happened multiple times since i was 21 up until 3 years ago (i am 45).  I have always felt that there was something wrong with me for not picking up early cues that these co-workers and friends had thought i was looking for something more with them. It has gotten to the point that I don‚Äôt really talk about anything personal at all with the people i work with now and my social circle has shrunk dramatically. I am ok with that, though.

FamilyIssues,fdrwu12,t3_emuggx,1578690861.0,"My grandma did the same thing to me (45f) and my two cousins (both m 46&48) when we were teenagers and would sleepover at her house sometimes. We were always close like siblings and would sleep in the same room at her house until i turned about 14. For some reason she started freaking out if we were in the same room after she went to bed, even if we were just watching tv or playing board games in the den together. She would make me go upstairs and sleep in my aunt‚Äôs bedroom while the boys slept in the den downstairs.

I later found out that one of my mom‚Äôs cousins had molested a lot of the girls in our family around this age and my grandma was afraid that history was going to repeat itself. Even though i know neither one of my cousins would do something like that to me, it really triggered her and she would get really irritable and unreasonable when she would see us together in the same room with no one else around. My grandma was such a laid back and fun lady that this change in demeanor was quite shocking. 

When i learned later in my life that a couple of my aunts and a lot of other female relatives had been molested by my mom‚Äôs cousin (my grandma‚Äôs nephew) it made sense why she reacted the way she did and she thought she was protecting me. The weird thing is my mom‚Äôs cousin never did anything to her because my mom always protected herself and taught me and my sisters to do the same, so I still think she was being a little too over-protective but can appreciate her trying to look out for me. 

I know this probably isn‚Äôt the same situation you are in right now, but maybe one day your mom can shed some light on why she us freaking out so bad when you hang out with your brother in his room. Maybe there is a history that you aren‚Äôt aware of with the males in your family and she is trying to protect you? Or maybe something happened to her that just triggers her when she sees you and your bro together alone in his room?

One day she may tell you why she reacts so harshly in this situation, but even if she doesn‚Äôt just don‚Äôt take it too personally and try to respect her wishes. Take your brother out to lunch or somewhere public to hang out together outside of the house and that might ease her mind hopefully."
ADHD,fdrrd7a,t1_fdqv88g,1578688554.0,"I started a new job last summer and noticed i experienced this paralysis when things got too chaotic around me, especially if my work area was a mess.

I didn‚Äôt even have to move from my seat, i would just open the drawer at my spot and started sorting out paper clips, post it note pads, staplers, etc.  

After the drawer was organized and looked neat it would motivate me to either do the task i was avoiding or start organizing another area. I actually dubbed it my ‚Äúproductive procrastination‚Äù when i realized what i was doing. My boss had been getting frustrated with my paralysis and didn‚Äôt understand what was going on, so that just fueled my anxiety and made it harder for me to get started on anything.

Unfortunately his ‚Äúmessiness‚Äù is part of the problem because we share the workspace and he leaves crap EVERYWHERE. It‚Äôs like i can‚Äôt even think straight when i walk in and see all of the stuff and papers piled up all over that he has left.  I have to have at least one area cleared away before i can even attempt to begin my regular tasks.

The bathroom breaks help too to gather my thoughts and give me clarity on how i can start whatever project i am putting off. I come up with a ‚Äúbaby steps‚Äù process where i think of the smallest thing i have to do first to get the ball rolling - ie, if i have to put in a difficult special order to a vendor i just picture my first step of the process which is to pick up the phone, next step is to dial the number, etc.

I still get the paralysis every once in a while where i can‚Äôt seem to snap out of it, but at least those episodes are getting fewer and farther apart. 

Hope this helps!"
CPTSD,fbwplsi,t3_eetpzw,1577156067.0,"I made it a tradition to go to the movies on Christmas day when i would spend it alone. It started when my narc relative and her psycho hubby up and left on a trip after we had breakfast Christmas morning without any notice. I was totally blindsided because we always spent the holidays together since i had moved near them (like for 10 years) and was 1700 miles away from my immediate family. It was a total dick move on their part that they didn‚Äôt at least give me a heads up so i could at least make other plans with my friends in the area. Plus it was the first Christmas without my uncle (the narc relative‚Äôs dad - he had passed away 6 weeks prior), so it was a total double whammy.

I cried for a little bit but i refused to sit home alone wallowing in the pain that they caused me and went to see a movie that i had been wanting to see for a while. I‚Äôd like to say that was the last time they abandoned on Christmas, but it wasn‚Äôt so i just made it a tradition for myself if i didn‚Äôt have other plans with my friends or working.  Eventually i stopped making plans with them for the holidays and ended up having a MUCH better time without them!

I have since moved back home and now spend Christmas with my immediate family again, but sometimes i kind of miss doing my own thing to make myself happy during the holidays. It‚Äôs actually pretty peaceful and you don‚Äôt have to stress out about accommodating other people and their schedules."

I was going to suggest that too! It is very healing and in a way i wished i had done this with all the stuff my narc relatives gave to me when i went NC. I chose to leave EVERYTHING they had ever bought me and every single physical photograph i had of/with them behind when i had to move out of their guest house i had been renting in the middle of the night. The only thing i kept was a Louis Vuitton purse they had given to me for my 40th bday a year before because a) i earned that bitch having to endure all of the crap they put me through and b) i knew my cousin secretly wanted to keep that purse for herself anyways and i knew she would just end up using it while acting like nothing happened. In a way it reminds me of everything i had overcome in spite of them trying to destroy me and drive me crazy. 

Whenever i see a bonfire though, i actually envision throwing all of the crap i left behind in it and just get a sense of relief and empowerment just from the thought."

AdultChildren,fapvpzr,t3_ea9pqf,1576294122.0,"I was 41 (almost 42) when i first read an article about traits that adult children of alcoholics/addicts possess and it was a literal epiphany for me. Like seriously angels started singing with a light from heaven shining down on me type of epiphany. I felt about 2 tons of emotional baggage being lifted off my shoulders after i finished reading it because i finally realized that i was never supposed to be carrying all that crap to begin with! It was the first time in my entire life i had ever felt real peace.

I celebrate the date i read that article as my ‚Äúsecond birthday‚Äù because i felt like i really started living my life for ME after that date. I stopped people pleasing, learned what boundaries were, realized that i am allowed to say NO to people and situations that were draining my energy. As of August 23, 2015 I shed all toxic relationships and situations i had been so desperately clinging to all my life that had been poisoning my soul because i didn‚Äôt know any better.

It was on that date that i finally started feeling and acting like an adult, but along the way I also started actually having fun in everything i do and being proud of all my achievements big or small. I feel like there are some areas in my life I need to work on a little more to keep on healing my past, but I know it will happen when the time is right. It is just an awesome feeling knowing that i do not have to control everything right this second and no matter what, i will always be ok because i have the most badass woman in my corner now telling me that on a daily basis.

JUSTNOFAMILY,f8agici,t3_dznf4j,1574396639.0,"- We had a weekend where everyone was off to move and told her we would be out by Sunday evening. Sunday morning my turd JustNo Cousin comes over, sits in the main doorway to start painting the trim and door, blocking us from taking stuff out the front door, we had to use the garage to get to the moving truck, and there was a hurricane coming in 3 days.... why the fuck is she painting????

Holy freaking crap, is your JNCousin related to mine????

My JNC pulled such a similar stunt on me!!! She persuaded me to rent her guest house on her property from her and we had an oral agreement that it would be for only two years while i got out of debt due to health issues. So 6 months shy of the end of the ‚Äúverbal lease‚Äù she told me that i had to move out in 6 weeks because they had to completely overhaul their main house on the property and needed to move into the guest house.

Long story short, i found a place to live literally two weeks after she gave me notice of my ‚Äúeviction‚Äù.  I gave her specific dates of when i would be moving my stuff out and asked her to keep her hubby and any repairmen out of the house until after the final date. Yeah, that didn‚Äôt happen. Every time I went to pick up more of my things I would notice that things would be moved and find some of their crap in there.  They even removed most of the light fixtures during this time!

The final straw was 1 week prior to my agreed upon move out date and i had gone over to pick up another load of my things when they pulled up in their truck to MOVE THEIR F*CKING MATTRESS into the house! After all the gaslighting they did to me up to that point, i finally snapped. I fit as much of my remaining things as i could into my car and left behind ALL of the crap she had ever given me in that house for her to deal with. I left all of the keys to the guest and main houses and the garage and gate clickers so they would know i wasn‚Äôt coming back for anything else. Plus i blocked her and the hubby from calling/texting me on my cell.

When i would tell people about this ‚Äúlast straw‚Äù they just didn‚Äôt get how seriously that affected me and how it pushed me over the edge. For 18 months i paid them rent and took care of soooo much shit for them at both houses. She and her psychopath hubby also ignored my requests (for all of those 18 months) to get things in the house repaired and THEN decided to fix it all in the two weeks i had specifically asked her NOT to come in? W.T.F?????

About 2 months after moving i went into my files to get the title for my car so i could donate it and transfer my plates to my new car only to find out that the title was missing from the folder! That MFing psycho took it out before i moved!!!! I know this because i had a stack of my important files sitting in the garage that i knew i would need and i made sure that title was on top of the folder with my other papers for my car. That was EXACTLY why i didn‚Äôt want them in the house before i could finish moving completely. I KNEW that her hubby would pull something screwy like that.

I am soooo sorry you had to go through all of that with your cuz, but you are definitely not alone in the bat shit crazy relatives department!"

confidence,f7dbcd7,t3_dvb36w,1573612346.0,"I can totally relate to this! Ever since i was a kid all i wanted to do was to work on films and tv shows and my mom ALWAYS laughed at me and put me down for my ambition. She would even ridicule me in front of family and friends and try to get them to do the same to me. I remember one time her best friend told her that she shouldn‚Äôt laugh at me because one day i could make it happen. Guess what? Her best friend was right! I DID achieve my goals and ended up moving to LA after college to work in production. I even started my career in the most cliche way by ‚Äústarting in the mailroom at MGM Studios‚Äù and worked my way up from there.  I ended up working for MTV, Aaron Spelling, and CBS just to name a few. I even worked on a movie with my childhood idol, Bette Midler. That was AWESOME! Yes, this was a LONG time ago and i am totally aging myself, but you can Google who Aaron Spelling and Bette Midler are. üòâ

Even though I did end up moving back home after a few years and changing career paths after i accomplished my initial goals (long story, but it was MY decision to go after my other life passion of traveling), I still work occasionally on productions filming near me when i have some time off. I still love being a part of that world, but it is more fun to do it on my terms as opposed to it consuming my entire life. 

It‚Äôs funny because I never really had anyone in my life that ever did anything like that when i was growing up. My parents thought that my goal should have been to become a manager at the grocery store i worked at in high school and college and to get married and start having kids. Ummmm no, no, and F*** NO to all that! I was the first one in my entire family (even my extended family) to graduate from college and get a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in anything. I totally flabbergasted EVERYONE in my life including my friends with my ‚Äúinsane‚Äù ambition and ended up proving ALL of my naysayers wrong.

I would love to share with you how I accomplished my goals at such a young age while my mother did everything she could to sabotage my success, but I am still not sure how I really did it except that I felt such a passion for being part of that industry I just never let anything or anyone get in my way. I did read A LOT of books and biographies of people in the entertainment industry who became successful by starting from the bottom and used their tips and tricks on how to get noticed or stand out from the millions of other ‚Äúhopefuls‚Äù i was competing with. 

Just keep your head up and celebrate your successes by yourself if you think no one else believes in your abilities. Live your life for YOU and follow your dreams like your life depends on it because it really does. 

My two favorite quotes from Lucille Ball that have helped me in all areas of my life are below:

  ‚ÄúLove yourself first and everything else falls into line.    You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world.‚Äù
   ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather regret the things I‚Äôve done than regret the things I haven‚Äôt done.‚Äù

Hope this helps and good luck following your passion!"
adhd_anxiety,f7d5tyf,t1_f7b62bi,1573608376.0,"5.	‚Å†Mental compartmentalization -  So by organizing my thoughts I found certain abilities greatly helped me to move forward. For instance, if I have a bunch of random information in front of me I cannot function (email, a messy room, etc) If I first categorize all those items I can then compartmentalize that information and suddenly I can think. My brain switches ON. So take email for instance, moving the email into folders or categories first allows me to see. It's like i am given new eyes at this point. I can then eliminate entire folders of junk, where as before I wasn't sure what to keep and what to get rid of (This is actually the cornerstone of my business too!). It may seemingly take longer, but it simplifies things for people like me. It is also very soothing for some reason and tames that squirrel.

This is sooooo me! My boss is pretty disorganized when it comes to our shared workplace and it drives me bonkers. I usually spend the first hour of all my shifts sorting out the chaos just so i can think clearly and then he gets frustrated with me for not starting my work right away. He doesn‚Äôt realize that I just CAN‚ÄôT think straight with all that clutter going on. One of these days he and i are gonna have to have a chat about it, as soon as i can get him to sit down for more than 30 seconds!

I had to block my grandmother a few years back because she kept badmouthing my dad (her oldest son) and mom (she NEVER liked my mom) to me even though i asked her to stop. A short backstory-my grandma actually tried to SUE my dad about 15 years ago over business issues and they haven‚Äôt spoken outside a courtroom/mediation room since. Oh and she lost in court. And she lost ALL of the appeals due to lack of evidence. The last judge actually told her that he would throw her ass in jail for contempt if she tried to appeal again because she was wasting everyone‚Äôs time with her charade. I actually heard the trial online directly the state‚Äôs supreme court website. 

My g-ma still to this day insists my dad wronged her and tells anyone who would listen this fantasy. I was the last one of my siblings and cousins (my uncle‚Äôs daughters - he was sued along with my dad because they owned the biz together) to stop talking to her. I am the oldest and was the closest to her growing up. My dad actually wanted me to keep in contact with her for a long time because he told me ‚Äúthis issue is about business‚Äù and that i should not let it interfere with my personal relationship with her. Staying in contact with her did affect my relationships with my sisters, though. They didn‚Äôt understand why i didn‚Äôt cut her off right away and they were very upset with me for a long time. 

I kept in minimal contact with her for about 12 years until she overstepped my boundaries one too many times. I reminded her over and over about how i didn‚Äôt want to hear her crap about my parents from her, but she just couldn‚Äôt resist badmouthing them to me. She wouldn‚Äôt always bring up the court case but would try to bring up how they ‚Äúabused‚Äù me when i was little in almost every conversation we had. I finally told her that i had resolved my issues with my parents and forgiven them and told her ‚Äúi already worked that stuff out with them and moved on, why can‚Äôt you do the same?‚Äù  I realized at that moment i would never be able to continue healing these issues with my past if she was going to be a part of my life. That was the day i blocked her from calling me and my aunt who is her biggest flying monkey.

She is the only living grandparent that my sisters and i have, yet we would rather have NO grandparents than have her toxic evilness in our lives. It is not easy especially since she lives only a couple miles away, but luckily i haven‚Äôt run into her anywhere in town. Of course i avoid public places i know she shops/eats at. 

Yes, you will feel guilty once in a while but the peaceful feelings you will have will outweigh the guilt! Just understand that their need to hold onto their toxicity will always come first and they will not give it up even after losing their grandchildren."

NarcissisticAbuse,f4dr10g,t3_dk7lrj,1571546322.0,"Welcome to the world of cognitive dissonance and trauma bonding after narc abuse. It sucks big time, but it does go away after a while. I had the same thing happen the first year i went NC. After doing A LOT of reading about this insidious abuse (thank God for my Kindle!) i realized i was ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù to the adrenaline rush of seeing the narc relatives. I used to go to places they would be at first because in a way i wanted them to see i was doing just fine without them. I felt like i was taking my power back if they saw me thriving by myself. So it actually happened one day. I saw my narc cousin at the gym and completely ignored her and pretended i didn‚Äôt see her standing there staring at me while i was on the treadmill. I was reading my kindle so intensely (about how to recover from toxic families LOL), but i could see her just out of the corner of my eye standing there for over 5 minutes. 

Soooo, mission accomplished right? For some reason i kept going back for more and each time i had this adrenaline surge when i pulled into the parking lot hoping/dreading to see her car there. I just got to the point where i asked myself WHY i was doing this and WHY do i still give a crap what she and her psycho hubby thought about me. Then one day i decided that my need to NOT see them overpowered my need for them to see me. That was the day i cancelled my gym membership and signed up for kickboxing classes at a totally different place to work out my anger issues about the situation. I also started using the fitness center at my apartment complex if i felt the need to read on the treadmill.

LifeAfterNarcissism,f456a87,t3_djffjo,1571367122.0,"I wonder about that with myself sometimes. I was 1700 miles away from my immediate family when i learned about narc abuse and went NC with my narc cousin and her psycho hubby. I literally moved out of the guest house i was renting from them in the middle of the night to escape their madness. 

For 13 years i was groomed and manipulated to believe that those two whack jobs were the only people i could trust and i lost touch with soooo many friends and alienated myself from my parents and sisters for that entire time. I used to be such an extrovert and now i am a borderline hermit even after almost 4 years of escaping the narc prison. I stayed in that same town as the abusers for 2 1/2 years while being able to maintain NC, but i noticed how much i was continuing to isolate myself and going out less and less. It was like i picked up where they left off by doing this, but i really did NOT want to bump into them anywhere in town. It only happened once luckily and i pretended not to notice the narc cousin staring at me at the gym. After that run in i canceled my membership and used the crappy ‚Äúfitness center‚Äù at my apartment complex.

I never really felt lonely going NC and it was actually a pretty peaceful time for me while i was healing from all their crap. It was actually too peaceful when i was alone because i didn‚Äôt have to worry about anyone or anything triggering my PTSD when i wasn‚Äôt at work.  I LOVED not having to check in with anyone about ANYTHING. It was truly the first time i had ever lived completely alone. I was in my early 40‚Äôs and had never married and never had kids, but i was always had friends or relatives who somehow played the ‚Äúauthority figure‚Äù involved in my life and i always felt i had to ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù with them. 

But there was this nagging feeling in the back of my head that i was missing something. I wasn‚Äôt ready to jump into a relationship because i was finally finding myself for the first time ever, but I knew i needed something more in my life ya know? That was when i met the biggest narcissist ever on the planet: my cat. LOL!!!! He is the ONLY narc i will ever let into my life again.  Holy crap that little ball of fur captured my heart and taught me how to love again. He was an ‚Äúaccidental kitten‚Äù who chose me to be his human and he came to me at exactly the right time. 

Having my cat made me reach out of my comfort zone (i never owned a pet on my own before) and realize how much i really could achieve by myself. It was like having him around kind of undid some of the negative programming i was carrying around with me from the narcs. It also made me realize that i was ready to move back home to be around my family again, which was a difficult decision because i LOVED the place i lived even if the narcs were still in that town too. I just knew i needed to have more of a support system around me and i needed to get away from the ‚Äúhoover zone‚Äù for a while.

I have been back home for a year and a half now, but i still kind of isolate myself because being around other people can be overstimulating and draining for me. Some of my family understands and some don‚Äôt, but i don‚Äôt care anymore. I now know what is best for me to continue my healing process and i am no longer letting other people‚Äôs opinions influence me or validate me. I have a few close friends who i hang out with about once a month who understand or at least they respect my boundaries when i have to cancel plans or leave early because i get overwhelmed by crowds.


It took me almost 4 years, moving across the country,  and obtaining a cat to learn all this stuff about myself and to understand there are times i just NEED to be alone to recharge and process stuff. So even though it seems like you are continuing the isolation your abusers subjected you to, you are just trying to find yourself again. If that means stripping everyone from your life for a while, so be it. The ones that have your back when you decide to reconnect with the world will be the people you KNOW you can trust. So what if your circle will be smaller at that time, at least it will be stronger and more stable for you.

In the meantime, seriously get a cat or dog or any pet you can connect with until you are ready to get back out in people-land. üòâ"

The last ‚Äúapology‚Äù i got from the narc cousin was a voicemail a year and a half after going NC saying she was ‚Äúsorry if she offended me in some way‚Äù and we needed to ‚Äúhave a chat so we can get past this.‚Äù  Talk about a non-apology! That was the last time i let her have any direct contact with me and blocked all of her personal and business phone numbers on my cell.

That tactic blew up in her face because it forced me to tell my parents about the sexual abuse she and her psycho hubby subjected me to for so many years. I really didn‚Äôt want my dad to know about that because most of his family are f‚Äôd up narcs, but not to her level.

Travel
Loved: going to cities i had never visited before and absolutely falling in love with some locations. My top three were Boston, San Jose CA, and Portland OR.

Hated: a majority of my layovers were VERY short, like only 8 hours long. You have to take into account that the ‚Äúrest period‚Äù of 8 hours includes getting everyone off the plane, taking a shuttle to the hotel (if you are lucky, the shuttle is waiting for you at the airport otherwise you sit there and wait), checking into the hotel, unpacking your stuff, grabbing something to eat (maybe), sleeping, waking up and getting ready to leave, check out of hotel, catch shuttle back to the airport, go through security, try to grab a quick bite to eat, be at the gate 45 mins to 1 hour prior to departure.  
I had a quite a few layovers like that in cities i would have loved to explore, but never got to see any of them in the daylight. I had many layovers in Buffalo, NY and wanted to see Niagra Falls soooo bad but never got the chance.

Loved: you will bond very closely to your training classmates and it was always fun to work trips together after graduation. Also i got to work with a lot of older flight attendants from Pan Am, TWA, Eastern, etc. and it was always fun to hear their stories from the ‚Äúglory days‚Äù in the industry. I loved it when there was at least 1 other f/a who would want to go out exploring with me during a longer layover. Sometimes you get lucky and the whole crew would want to hang out. I had a crew like that during a 4 day trip with only Newark, NJ layovers every day. They made it so much fun because we all went to NYC one day and acted like total tourists and did at least one fun thing each night of that trip.
Hated: the bitter flight attendants who were on power trips and were absolute b*tches to passengers. They were usually the ones with more seniority that got jaded over time. Luckily those f/a‚Äôs preferred to do 1 day turn around trips, so at least you aren‚Äôt stuck with them for multiple days at a time. Some of the senior crew on longer trips were called ‚Äúslam-clickers‚Äù. They were the ones that would not come out of their hotel rooms during the entire layover because they could care less about sightseeing or even hanging out for drinks at the bar once we checked into our rooms. Last, but not least: pilots-God‚Äôs gift the our planet. Just accept they are God and you will get along just fine with them.

Passengers
Loved: when they got off the plane. LOL a majority of the people you deal with are really not that bad. The seniors were always my favorite to take care of on my flights. My Boston passengers were always the most fun and polite.
Hated: i don‚Äôt even know where to start with this one because it was usually market specific as to the behavior of the people onboard. West Palm Beach people were the WORST behaved and the highest maintenance before, during, and after a flight ESPECIALLY if they were going to NYC or New Jersey. 

I hope this helps a little bit with your decision. Please keep in mind these things too: 
1. You probably won‚Äôt be based in the city you currently live in and would have to get a ‚Äúcrash pad‚Äù in the city you will be working from unless you decide to move completely.
2. Training is anywhere from a month to 6 weeks and the pay is REALLY low for that. Some airlines don‚Äôt even pay you during training AND make you pay for uniforms upfront. 
3. Your schedule will be completely erratic for the first few years because you will be on ‚Äúreserve‚Äù until you are senior enough to hold a line (have a regular schedule with set trips). Plus the schedule/trips change each month and you have to ‚Äúbid‚Äù for them each time.
4. Be prepared to buy twice as much for all of your necessities and toiletries (make up, toothbrushes, etc.). It is much easier to do that so you can have your ‚Äúhome stuff‚Äù and your ‚Äútrip stuff‚Äù without having to keep packing/unpacking each time you take a trip.

Good luck!"

About a year after i moved out on my own after living in ‚Äúhell‚Äù for 13 years, i met a cute little 2 month old ball of fur who chose me to be his human. He completely changed my world and has helped me through some of the toughest times in my life. A lot of my family and friends think i am off my rocker and have become a full fledged crazy cat lady, but it is a good thing i don‚Äôt give a crap about other people‚Äôs opinions anymore!

She is constantly pawning them off to our parents and her in laws because she can‚Äôt ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with them.

I am so glad i just decided to become a crazy cat lady instead. Every time she bitches to me about how much she hates being a mom i just look her in the eyes and say ‚Äúaaanndd that is why i have a cat!‚Äù It is also pretty awesome being the ‚Äúfun‚Äù aunt to two of the cutest kids ever."

NarcissisticAbuse,f1ai5l2,t3_d8eg9g,1569294659.0,"NC is like withdrawal from a drug. Your body is still addicted to the flight or fight process that you had when you were with the narc and looking for a way to recreate those reactions. By checking up on them in‚Äùsafe‚Äù ways by looking at their social media accounts, for example, you get that rush of adrenalin you are unknowingly craving.

It is a vicious cycle, but as time goes on you find that you seek those ‚Äúhits‚Äù less and less. It took me almost 6 months to stop doing stuff like that or driving by the house late at night or going to the gym at times i knew they were going to be there. I had soooo much anger inside and i thought i wanted them to see how much better i was doing without them. What i realized from reading God knows how many books about narc abuse was that i was looking for that rush because my body didn‚Äôt know what to do without it.

Eventually i resigned my membership from the gym and started using the one at my apartment complex to avoid running into the narcs and realized the ‚Äúdrive by‚Äôs‚Äù and social media spying were harming my healing. I also found a therapist who specialized in overcoming this kind of abuse and did EMDR therapy which helped TREMENDOUSLY! 

I hope this helps and you stay strong to keep no contact because it is totally worth it! You won‚Äôt be exactly the same person as before the narc, but you will definitely be a LOT stronger!!!  Good luck!"
NarcissisticAbuse,f1aaaz4,t3_d83nac,1569288909.0,"The one ‚Äòtruth‚Äô that sticks out to me was when my narc relative told me ‚Äúyou were supposed to go away‚Äù. This was my wake up call and what made me start observing my life and why I didn‚Äôt simply ‚Äúgo away‚Äù when i probably should have. Here is an abbreviated version of my story:

She and her psychopath hubby helped me move 1700 miles from home for my dream job. I only asked to use their address when i applied for the job, but when i landed it they insisted i move in with them til i was financially stable enough to live on my own. Worst. Decision. Ever. What i realize now is that the first six months i lived with them was a non-stop love bombing stage. They even paid off my credit card debts and bought me a car, even though the car i had just needed to be fixed. They convinced me that it wasn‚Äôt safe and i couldn‚Äôt possibly buy a new one on my own. 

So after 6 months, they get me all set up in my new apartment, decorated it while i was at work, and bought me EVERYTHING i needed for it. What‚Äôs so bad about that, you may wonder? Well it made me completely dependent on them for like every freaking decision in my life! After 6 months of them doing everything for me i am living on my own completely alone in a new town where i don‚Äôt know anyone outside of work and then radio silence from them for weeks. I was freaking out! I grew up with three younger sisters and TONS of extended family at home, so i didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I guess this was the time she meant when she said that i was supposed to ‚Äúgo away‚Äù.

Being lonely and desperate, I found any way i could to stay in the narc/psycho‚Äôs lives by giving up my weekends to help them renovate their guest house for my elderly aunt and uncle to move into eventually. Plus it made me feel like i was paying back my debt to them more than just making our arranged monthly payments for the cc/car loan. I was actually doing really well for 2 1/2 years living on my own and paying off their loan when she starts telling me that it might be easier for me financially if i just moved back in with them. I could just use my rent money to make bigger payments on my loan to them. Ha! I wish i could go back in time and kick my own ass for trusting them.

So i did what was suggested and moved back in. Big mistake. Huge. Massive. Now i was helping ‚Äúbabysit‚Äù my elderly aunt and uncle while my narc decided to go play Flight Attendant Barbie. To make a long story short, this happened two more times over 13 years where i had moved out on my own and totally ignored by them only to be roped back into living with them to ‚Äúsave me money‚Äù and pay back this loan from the beginning.

So for 13 years i felt indebted to them because i truthfully had noooo idea how much i still owed on my original loan. I was doing everything i could to pay it off including working for them at their so called ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù  without being paid on top of working my full time job. It was the last time i moved in with them (but into their guest house after my aunt and uncle had both passed away) so i could ‚Äúhelp them out‚Äù (her words) that she dropped that little truth bomb of ‚Äúyou were supposed to go away‚Äù that finally woke me up. I finally saw the pattern with them that every time i was doing ok on my own, they convinced me that i wasn‚Äôt and the only way out was by living with them. It took a year and a half of living in pure hell after that and discovering narc abuse and finally going no contact that saved my sanity."
LifeAfterNarcissism,f16esnk,t3_d7zmv6,1569210317.0,My narc cousin did the same thing after i went no contact. They do it to try to gain new supply and it makes me so sick to my stomach!
JUSTNOFAMILY,f0xk0j7,t3_d6nk4k,1569035191.0,"That is totally crazy that your mom would call your dad that!!! Oh yeah, you totally need to cut all contact as soon as you can get your bunny to safety. 

Just a heads up though, do NOT tell her or ANYONE who talks to her that you are about to cut her out of your life. Don‚Äôt even say anything to your dad just in case he slips and says something to your mom or any of their common acquaintances. If she catches wind of your future actions, i am afraid of what she would do to that poor bunny or give him away just to spite you. If she is low enough to accuse your dad of being a pedophile in front of you, she is capable of cruelty beyond imagination!

I hope things get better for you and you can be reunited full time with your bunny!!!"
JUSTNOFAMILY,f0w8dr0,t1_f0vvtbm,1569001374.0,"I think the most frustrating part is that the manipulators actually believe their lies and there is no way to make them see the damage it does to us. My narc cousin i was extremely close to is a total pathological liar. It was the most baffling thing to sit there and listen to her lie about pretty much EVERYTHING not only to me but also her friends and colleagues. One example is she would constantly tell people the dumbest things like how she hadn‚Äôt taken a day off from work in 3 years, which was total bullsh!t. She owned a ‚Äútravel agency‚Äù and took very elaborate trips at least once a month. What was even more odd was the fact she thought she was impressing people by saying this, when in fact it had the opposite effect. I always took notice of the reactions of the people she said this to and they would look at her funny and kind of back away from her physically. I tried to point this out to her, but she denied seeing that.

I also reread your original post and i can empathize with you bug time about getting ‚Äúvolunteered‚Äù to take care of her responsibilities. Holy crap that really struck a chord with me! My cousin used to do that ALL the time to me and manipulated situations to the point where i was actually trapped into taking care of HER responsibilities at home and for her company. I even ended up putting my health in jeopardy when she bullied me into helping escort her tour group to Disneyworld with severe kidney stones. She guilted me so bad and lectured me about following through with promises that i felt i had no other choice. I ended up needing surgery to remove them a few days later. That was the beginning of my wake up call about the person she really is.  It is such a hard pill to swallow knowing that a person can say all the right things and ‚Äúi love you‚Äù and continually hurt you in the most painful ways possible with their actions. 

I tried for soooo long to make her see and take responsibility for her actions, but she always ended up spinning things around and tried to make me look like the bad guy and an ungrateful person for confronting her. 3 years of no contact and moving 1700 miles away from her and i still struggle to keep my sanity about the whole thing because it destroyed my trust to a degree with EVERYONE in my life. I get sooo overly angry when i think someone is lying to me or omitting information. I will  lash out at them with snarky comments or end up cutting contact with that person completely because i am too tired to keep playing their games. My well being is more important than staying in their life just because we are family or have history together. 

I am much happier now with a VERY small circle of friends and family, but it has taken a long time to get here. 

I hope this helps and just remember that you have every right to say No to anyone who volunteers your services instead of taking the responsibility themselves."

JUSTNOFAMILY,f0v27cs,t3_d6nk4k,1568959948.0,"The first thing you should do is research ‚Äúgaslighting‚Äù and its effects on victims. Your post hit pretty much every bullet point of what it is and how it makes normal people react. I endured gaslighting by my narcissist relative AND her psychopath husband for 13 years and it drove me literally bat. sh!t. crazy! I do not lose my temper easily at all and about 3/4 through that 13 year period i noticed i was losing my shit over the smallest thing, ESPECIALLY if someone lied to me. Holy hell i would freak out! Even though i learned all about gaslighting and emotional abuse over 3 years ago, i still get triggered and super angry if i know someone is straight up lying to me. At least now i can remain calm in that person‚Äôs presence and point out the false crap or just walk away from them and turn my attention to  something more positive while working out my anger. I like to do the mandala coloring books for adults, take my dog for a walk, play with my cat, anything that helps me process the anger so it is not inside me wreaking havoc on my psyche and physical health. 

Learn to let go of trying to prove them wrong and look up articles about setting boundaries with gaslighters if you can‚Äôt go ‚Äúno contact‚Äù. Trust me, it is not you. It is totally all them!"

LifeAfterNarcissism,f0uy54y,t3_d6n0ax,1568954998.0,"I would LOVE to know the answer to that question myself! After learning about narcissism three years ago, i cut off anyone in my life who was a narcissist or was just plain toxic to me. Most of those people were my relatives and my best friend of 27 years. I am VERY guarded now with meeting new people and am basically a hermit with a small close knit immediate family and like literally 3 close friends. I am ok with being alone, but i noticed that regardless how much i try to protect myself i always seem to attract these narcs and toxic ppl into my life. 

I moved 1700 miles back home to get a fresh start and reconnect with my parents and sisters, all of whom i had unknowingly estranged from due to the narc relatives‚Äô brainwashing. I took my time getting a job because the one i left behind to move was freaking AMAZING. I still ended up working at two different places in the same industry and both times my bosses ended up being narcs from hell! I am finally working at a place where my co-workers and managers are great and i had been doing much better emotionally outside of work.

Since i was finally starting to feel like my old self (before my 13 years of intense narc abuse), i decided to accept an old friend‚Äôs request to go to a football game with him. When he contacted me with the invite he asked if i wanted to bring someone cuz he had an extra tkt, so i figured it would be ok and he wasn‚Äôt trying to date me. He is married and i thought his wife would be coming with us. I grew up with him and he was like a brother to me in school. We lost contact after college, so i thought it would be fun to catch up with him and his wife who i knew in high school, as well.

Long story short, his wife didn‚Äôt go.  i didn‚Äôt find this out til i was literally in his driveway to pick him up. Luckily my cousin was with me so at least i wasn‚Äôt alone with this guy. He tells me that his old college buddy was the one who gave us the tickets and he was meeting us in the city for dinner and the game. So i am like, ok maybe his wife had to work and couldn‚Äôt make it.

At first it was fun catching up, but then i noticed he was doing 90% of the talking. And he didn‚Äôt stop talking until i dropped him off - eight freaking hours later. When we finally got to the parking lot after 2 hours held captive in traffic, he was looking up the items that were not allowed in the stadium. Shockingly, knives are prohibited. So he‚Äôs like ‚Äúbetter leave this in your car‚Äù and pulls out a huge switchblade from his pants pocket! My cuz n i were like what. the. f@ck!? He saw our faces and then proceeds to tell us that he takes that knife AND others where ever he goes, but he decided to leave the extras at home that night. Was that supposed to make us feel better????

Fast forward to the end of the night and as he was getting out of my car at his house, he says to me ‚Äúmy wife doesn‚Äôt like going to sporting events so would u like to go with me if i get tix for another game?‚Äù At this point i have a raging headache from the 8 hour gab-a-thon i was like ‚Äúyeah, sure, whatever‚Äù just to get him out of my car! I sped out of his driveway as quick as i could at that point.

So the next day he sends me a ‚Äúthank you‚Äù text that someone would send after a date. He also mentioned that he was looking forward to attending more games with me. Did i mention he was married? I was still so exhausted from listening to him for 8 FREAKING HOURS the day before i didn‚Äôt have the strength to answer.  In the past couple weeks since that night he has sent a couple more texts that i have left unanswered. They seem somewhat harmless, but i saw wayyy too many red flags from just 1 night w/ him that i don‚Äôt even want to respond. 

Sorry i rambled a bit here, but it is soooo frustrating because i have worked so hard to avoid toxic people and situations like this when i want to be more social. So i would REALLY like to know the answer to what more i can do to stay off these whack jobs‚Äô radars besides becoming a complete recluse???

Thanks for letting me vent and if you read my entire post, you are a trooper! üòâ

JUSTNOFAMILY,f0uo9pw,t3_d6jtfh,1568946043.0,"Oh yeah i used to get those A LOT when i first cut contact with my narc cousin and moved out of her house and life after 13 years of HELL. The nightmares were sooo freaking vivid that i would wake up and be sitting up straight as an arrow hyperventilating!

Eventually they started tapering off and after 3 1/2 years after going no contact, i barely have one. I do notice that i will have a ‚Äúnarc cousin‚Äù nightmare when i am super stressed or see something or someone that reminds me of her or her psychopath husband. Luckily the nightmares now are not as vivid, but i am still a little f‚Äôd up for a couple days afterwards.

Have you tried EMDR with a psychologist/counselor yet? That helps tremendously with the PTSD symptoms and some other issues that i never realized were related to all that crap. At least now i can talk about what happened with them to other people without freezing up. And somehow it cured my intense fear of heights! Not sure how that happened?

Hang in there, it DOES get better and the new life you are creating without her will be amazing."
