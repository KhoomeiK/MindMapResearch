I agree with you. The emotional backlash Blizzard is getting is ridiculous. People are thinking with their emotions rather than using their brains and thinking logically. The tournament has rules, and all they did was enforce those rules. You can't suddenly give this guy a free pass just because it's a sensitive subject right now, that defeats the whole purpose.

And people are trying to act like he is the victim in the situation, saying he got ""stripped of 50,000 dollar prize"". He got stripped of it, rightfully so, *because he didn't follow the tournament rules.*

Additionally, I think a lot of Americans forget that our freedom of speech, the first amendment, only protects us from being censored by the *government*. Blizzard is a private company, so you don't get that same protection.

Logically speaking, people have literally no right to be upset. But, because it's Hong Kong and because it's a sensitive subject, anyone who doesn't blindly support it despite what sacrifice may come, is a bad guy.

Blizzard is a company, business and profit is their top priority. China is a big supplier of that profit. They will obviously prefer to protect and secure their assets over having any stance in a political issue.

Disclaimer: I'm not against the liberation of Hong Kong, I'm all for it. What I'm against is people giving a private gaming company shit for enforcing their tournament rules and then getting upset that a **company** cares about money and profit."
