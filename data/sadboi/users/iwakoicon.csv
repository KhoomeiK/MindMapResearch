Anxiety,fqprh8v,t1_fqou127,1589552596.0,"First of all, I hope that your mom is doing alright! Secondly, there is a concept in psychology called the diathesis-stress model. Basically, diathesis is in regards to a person's predisposition to a disorder (anxiety). When stressful life events happen, they increase your likelihood of having a certain disorder. 

Cancer is a life changing sickness. I have friends who currently are being affected by cancer, and it impacts every part of their life. As far as stressors go, cancer is probably one of the largest. But then again it could also not be your mom's cancer affecting you, I am just speculating. 

I hope that this helps you with understanding what's happening."

When he does these ""docuseries"" it is just him and the person he's investigating, and the theme of the video oscillates from him trying to be serious to him making self-deprecation jokes. 
I HATED the Jake Paul Series, not only did he start the series by villanizing mental illness, but he folded like a house of cards while he was talking to Jake and even became an echo chamber for him. 
The main problem with Shane and his content is that he wants everyone to like him, so he changes his standpoints so that they do. This just makes him come across as disingenuous. He shouldn't be chasing after the drama if he cannot handle other people's opinions, and I just wish that he would go back to making content that he seemed to have more fun doing."

I brushed it off, and started setting up the rest of the tables, while I was lighting candles, she demanded a cup of water, and I was told to grab her one from the other side building.

I developed helpful strategies to cope with my feelings, and had a safe space to vent about whatever and to be vulnerable. 

I learned how to be more independent in college and how to develop meaningful relationships with others when my previous relationships were shallow and not meaningful at all. The more experiences that I force myself to have, the more that I learn what is helpful and not helpful for myself.

I still see some of the traits you listed in myself, but I'm slowly making changes to improve! I hope that you are able to make positive changes in yourself, if not now, maybe later when you can cut the toxicity out of your life."

I used to run a blog that discussed horror movies and other scary things like that. I got to know a few other people and would message them to talk about horror outside of the blog. There was this one guy who I spoke to and we started to become friends. After a few weeks he started to speak extremely self destructively, and anything I tried to say to help him he shut it down. 

At one point he asked me to join a long distance relationship with him and I declined (we didn't even know each other's names). After this his self deprecation became more aggressive and I slowly started to withdraw. When he mentioned he was suicidal I didn't really know what to do. I spoke with him for a few hours and gave him the national hotlines to call, and when it was 2am I told him that I was going to go to bed and that I would speak to him the next day. He said ok. 

The next day I got a message from someone on his account claiming to be his sister. She said that he killed himself and that she wanted to thank the people he talked to online for speaking with him.

Finally, I read that if your Montgomery glands are inflamed (like big) you should put a warm compress on them to promote them to drain. I haven't tried this yet, but I want to give this a shot specifically because it seems like it could be relaxing! Especially with a bath involved as well.
