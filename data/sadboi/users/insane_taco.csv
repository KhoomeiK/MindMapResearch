Paranormal,esotnwu,t3_c80g2g,1562174029.0,"Before I start, I apologize as I’m on mobile.

I’ve actually had this happen to me. I had this dream earlier this year that my uncle (he’s my uncle through marriage, not blood) had died. I’ll try to recall the dream.  This is the part I’m not exactly sure about but I think In the dream that my uncle died due to a car crash and was coughing up blood before he died.

Anyways, I am sure about the following: In the dream he had died unexpectedly, and I was crying a lot about it with my mom. I was extremely torn up about his passing and everyone was sad but there weren’t really any words spoken. Then I woke up and felt confused. The first thing I did was ask my mom if my uncle was alive. Which caught her off guard, it got her confused. I then tell my mom about the dream.  Also, I forgot to mention that we’re Mexican, and in Mexican culture when you dream of someone dying it means that someone is going to die. It isn’t necessarily the person that you dreamt about but it does give a warning and the outcome will most likely be someone will die or has died.  Turns out, someone *very* close to my uncle would pass away within the next five days. It caught all of us off guard. 

Also, in our culture, when you dream of teeth falling out, it is also a sign that someone’s going to pass or has passed. However, it can also mean that someone is going to have serious health complications. I also had a dream close In time to the one I described earlier. I dreamt that my teeth fell out. Upon waking up, I immediately told my mom. Then I mentioned it at  breakfast to my extended family, specifically my grandparents. (The reason I mention my grandparents is because they are more “connected” to that kind of thing because they grew up with more traditional and old fashioned parents who held very supernatural beliefs and saw some shit in their lifetimes.) 

I don’t exactly remember who got the short end of the stick this time but I think it was this dude who I’ll call L. L was my cousins husband and ended up in a coma due to a tumor. He had been told he had a chance to pull through. But around a week after I told my grandparents my dream he passed. Even though L had done some pretty... questionable things and was mean spirited at times, my grandparents were sad because he had left behind a little girl and his wife. (They were rebuilding their relationship in a less toxic manner.)

These are just what I have dreamt, but mostly everyone in my family has had these dreams at some point in their lives and/or have had many of these dreams."
