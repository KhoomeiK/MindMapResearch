AsianBeauty,f3qld55,t3_dhlq87,1571076629.0,"I have the Purito cream (and serum). When I first used the cream I thought it broke me out so I put it aside. I‚Äôve been patch testing for 2 1/2 weeks on part of my cheek (a common breakout area) and have had no breakouts. I‚Äôve started using it now on 1/2 of my face just to further patch test but on a larger area. Been doing that for about 5 days now and so far so good. I‚Äôve never tried the Iunik one. I think my problem at first was when I started using the cream, I introduced two new products along side it and my diet changed (for the worse) plus stress. Putting it aside and reintroducing it has been a good idea :-)

SkincareAddiction,f2cc643,t3_dcwh5w,1570136475.0,"I‚Äôd almost switch the routine around. Do the cleansing with the cleanser and use the salicylic acid at night. Use just water to cleanse in the AM. After we have gone through the day our face is full of dust, pollutants, sweat etc and you really want to clean that off. 

Even though the skin is oily you still want to moisturize so keep that up. Maybe add an AHA? I like the CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid. It‚Äôs gentle with only 7% glycolic acid."

SkincareAddiction,ex8w24c,t1_ex8n2od,1566079656.0,I‚Äôve also been following that idea that salicylic acid was for oily skin and aha is for dry.  I struggle with acne and combo oily skin.

AsianBeauty,ex8qzbh,t1_ex88p63,1566077626.0,I‚Äôm a big fan of the Purito Centella line. I use the green level buffet serum and just started using the corresponding green level recovery cream. I‚Äôve got acne prone skin and these products have not triggered it. I feel that the cream helps with the dryness. Using the two together (for me) is great. Helps calm any irritation I currently have and helps my skin look smooth.

AsianBeautyAdvice,etjwk5z,t3_cbti4y,1562883155.0,"Hi! I‚Äôd like some feedback plus maybe a fun product to add/ replace. 

My skin is combo/oily. Im African American skin tone is about NC44 in MAC shade. Concerns are acne, and hyperpigmentation from past acne. My acne are papeles. Under the skin, small, no whitehead but bigger than a closed comedone. Occasional painful cystic pimple. 
Goals- eliminate acne of course. Anti aging and reduce hyperpigmentation. I‚Äôm in my early 30s. And I want to look bright and fresh. Here‚Äôs my current routine:

AM
1) La Roche Posay purifying foaming Cleanser for oily skin
2) Cosrx BHA liquid 
3 ) CosRX Snail essence (sometimes)
4) Purito centella green level Buffet serum
5) Skin Aqua super moisture moisture milk 50++++

PM
1) LRP foam cleanser
2) Curology (tretinoin, azelaic acid, clindamycin)
3)  CosRX Snail essence
4) Purito serum
5) Cos RX oil free ultra moisturizing lotion with birch sap 

I have the Scinic Honey all in one ampule but not sure where to fit it in or if I should replace one of my products with it. Any recommendations are appreciated !"
acne,etglx74,t3_cbiwc3,1562793889.0,"Vitamin C seems to be the move. There‚Äôs this serum I hear a lot of people rave about called Milano CC. It‚Äôs Japanese but easily accessible on eBay by trusted sellers.  Niacinamide is also great. 

I‚Äôve had great success with Cureology prescription which has tretinoin, azelaic acid and clindamycin. My problem is that I keep getting little pimples so I keep getting new hyperpigmentation. But it seems to go away rather quickly with my routine."

BlackHair,et59s4m,t3_c9wmqh,1562467779.0,"I have something somewhat similar (and I‚Äôm a woman) *cries a little bit* mine comes from my maternal grandfather. I have hair in those areas it‚Äôs just thinner and it‚Äôs been that way since I was a child. 

I‚Äôve heard that things like pure Jamaican black castor oil have helped people to grow hair as well as rosemary essential oil mixed with a carrier oil. I‚Äôve not tried any of those things so unfortunately I can‚Äôt vouch for either. You can look it up and see if you want to try. But since it‚Äôs genetic you may want to talk to a trichologist in your area."
AsianBeauty,esfo4eh,t3_c79dka,1561930895.0,"Has anyone else found that DHC cleansing oil broke them out? I‚Äôm wondering if it is just me. Granted I know ymmv.

*edited to add the second question."
AsianBeauty,esfnv36,t1_esfmery,1561930714.0,Personal favorite is the skin aqua super moisture milk. I have extremely acne prone combo oily skin and it hasn‚Äôt broken me out nor does it make me more oily.
AsianBeauty,eryn3bo,t1_erycayu,1561412396.0,I use the COSRX Oil Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap. I‚Äôve got combo oily acne prone skin. I like this one. The smell still throws me off at times. To me it smells like tea tree. It‚Äôs a solid product and there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with it. It does a great job at moisturizing but for some reason  I‚Äôm also looking to try something new. Do you mind letting me know what you decide?
AsianBeauty,ertk8a6,t1_eribjk2,1561244801.0,I use this too and it works well for me. I have combo-oily acne prone skin. I‚Äôm brown (NC44) and it leaves no white cast. I agree that I can skip lotion and it does wear well under makeup. I usually wait a couple of minutes after application to put on makeup.
AsianBeauty,erlirjh,t1_erd7tpg,1560988278.0,"I‚Äôve been using Kiehl‚Äôs Lip Balm #1 which I feel is pretty much like Vaseline. Fresh Sugar Lip balms have replaced my lipsticks. And that‚Äôs about it. Recently I‚Äôm doing a layer of the Laneige then using a lip pencil all over my lips then putting the Fresh lip balm on top to get a little more color. 

I‚Äôm definitely going to get the Fenty gloss soon and I‚Äôm going to have to choose between trying the DHC and the madecassoside lip mask"
AsianBeauty,ercikl6,t1_ercf6xc,1560713128.0,The Fenty lip gloss has been on my watch list for a while now! I‚Äôve accepted that matte colors are just never going to work for me so I‚Äôve been looking for acceptable (aka not super shiny and sticky) glosses & tinted chapsticks.  I‚Äôve never seen O‚ÄôKeeffes in the squeeze tube. Had the blue cap stick one and tried to like it but didn‚Äôt do a thing for me. I‚Äôm going to look into this madecassoside lip mask.
AsianBeauty,er97f08,t3_c0y39s,1560618623.0,"Yes!! And I am still in that phase to some extent.  I‚Äôve got a diff skin type than you (combo oily that seems to be balancing out a little with my Curology). It took me a while to figure out what results I was going for. Basically I did many a google search about what ingredients are good for ‚Äúx‚Äù and tried to see what ingredients I was seeing most.  Then I would look for the AB product that contained that ingredient. Then I would search the AB sub reddit for that ingredient to see what products these lovely folks were using and their opinions. Then back to google to look for blog reviews of said products. 
I know that in and of itself may sound overwhelming or a LOT but I found it interesting and better use of my time than mindlessly scrolling through Facebook. I started being able to give some advice to my friends and it fed my need to constantly be learning something haha. ALSO, it saved me a lot of money because I wasn‚Äôt buying product after product after product trying to find THE product."
AsianBeauty,er9673d,t3_c0xv8b,1560617982.0,"Sorry to hear about the reactions. Do you have any ideas about what ingredient may have been the culprit? I hope no one minds if I share my experience with the Laneige LSM. I enjoy it because I have consistent peeling lips that look so bad even  with ‚Äúmoisturizing‚Äù  lipsticks. I carry the lsm around with me and layer that under and it looks great. I‚Äôve not found a lip scrub that has made any difference. They work for about 10 mins then after the lip balm has worn off, the hard skin comes back and it‚Äôs a cycle. After a week of consistent application of the lsm the hard skin is not nearly as hard. I‚Äôve had better results from this product than plan lanolin and any other type of chapstick, lip balm etc. 

Love the comments about the DHC lip cream and it‚Äôs exfoliating properties. I‚Äôm going to have to get that even though I promised myself I would not spend any more money buying lip products. 

I was close to getting the ginger one but after reading this I‚Äôm glad I held off."
AsianBeauty,eq9wzy3,t1_eq9ugk4,1559919905.0,If you‚Äôve never purged from anything maybe you‚Äôll be ok. I‚Äôm extremely acne prone. Like I sneeze and a pimple pops up so I expect it with any type of exfoliant haha. Hope it works out!
AsianBeauty,eq9n0yn,t1_eq9gshf,1559912413.0,I second the Purito Centella Green Level.... and the Kikumasamune Sake High Moist. I can‚Äôt kiku on my face because it breaks me out but it‚Äôs an EXCELLENT body moisturizer for me. And it‚Äôs got brightening properties! I‚Äôve never used the hada Labo brightening/whitening one but it‚Äôs been on my list to buy as soon as I finish up a few of the other productsI already have. I‚Äôm black too and want to go hard on this hyperpigmentation on my cheeks and forehead. It‚Äôs so annoying.
AsianBeauty,eq9mm2y,t1_eq93nol,1559912045.0,"I recently purchased the cosrx bha blackhead power liquid and I feel like it‚Äôs complimenting my other skincare products. I do already use a retinoid and azealic acid but had not been seeing results but after adding this and using it for 2 months I‚Äôm noticing a smoothness and glow  in my skin. Just try it out, take some before pictures and maybe don‚Äôt set your expectations too high (haha) and check things out after 1 month, 2 months, 3 months etc. The first month for me was a mess. I guess I was purging and it was very annoying."
Naturalhair,eplsl00,t3_bv25nr,1559302599.0,I have low porosity hair as well  and I have found that using silicone free products have helped me quite a bit. Using (hot) water helps and applying my products in the shower while my hair is really wet. I rarely if ever use cold water on my hair.
AsianBeauty,epd7ndo,t1_epb81nl,1559162912.0,"Forgive my ignorance but what exactly does this product do? I went out and bought it when people were freaking out about it being discontinued (hahaha). I bought it from this site called Kurious Mall.  But I‚Äôm not sure if it can help me with my main problem of these under the skin pimples that are not painful cystic but bigger than closed comedones. (Extremely frustrating). I‚Äôve got some issues too but I‚Äôm curious to know what other people use it for. Thanks in advance.
