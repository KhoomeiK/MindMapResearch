Let me tell you a story. 
When I was young, a sibling in my house molested me. Multiple times. 

As I got older, I wanted to lock my door to be able to keep him out. I was never allowed to lock my door, and if I was caught with it locked, my father would hit it so hard to try to scare me into opening it that it would nearly break. I was never allowed to lock my door. Not once. 

Even now, I am eighteen years old, and I‚Äôm still interrogated and intimidated into not locking my door. 

I wanted a lock for safety, and privacy. My abuser would still, up until I reported him this year, come into my room and watch me change clothes, and refuse to leave. 

I‚Äôm not at all saying that this is the case in your house, but trust me, if she‚Äôs asking to lock her door, and is this adamant, she has a reason.

We go to the store, get creamer, and I pull out my phone to see what I need to buy.

Not to mention that you completely invalidated her queerness by implying that how she identifies doesn‚Äôt matter since she‚Äôs with a man now. If you truly care about your girlfriend and are accepting of her queer identity, you would have let her speak for herself, and respected her sexuality."
AmItheAsshole,ephzbsf,t3_bumw4x,1559232848.0,"I know it‚Äôs been said, but OP, you are NOT just disinviting your brother and his husband from your wedding. You have almost certainly lost them for life. You defended family that wasn‚Äôt even yours yet, and their bigoted behavior, over your own flesh and blood. 

As a queer person, trust me, if I were your brother, I wouldn‚Äôt ever speak to you again. You don‚Äôt deserve that relationship if you aren‚Äôt going to protect him from the hatred and bigotry that your fianc√©‚Äôs family is spewing."

Actual person with a phobia of mirrors here! (Catoptrophobia) 
It is a legitimate thing, but yeah this lady is just fucking with OP in hopes of a free stay."

AskReddit,eouwsvm,t3_bt3zc7,1558882981.0,"My entire family refuses to believe there was a shadow person in my room when I was 6-12ish. He showed up most when I was around 8-9 years old, and would mostly just watch me, and never spoke. 
I did research later, and learned that shadow people prey on young children, the sick or disabled, and the elderly. At the time my SP showed up most, I had just been through a traumatic time where I became disabled unexpectedly. So yeah, that was pretty freaky."
