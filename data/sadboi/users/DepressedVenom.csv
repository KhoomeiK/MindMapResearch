not just bc nofap is such an underground movement (this is the only active place) but also bc of the way feminism is being used by chicks wanting to show off their ass.  
I mean, I'm all for equality and better rights for women, but if you use the argument that you should be able to walk around town naked and not be looked at by men, you're full of shit IMHO.  
   
I consider myself a feminist but have to disagree with fellow feminists and friends, incl those that are ""feminazis"" (tbh I consider some to be that much of an over-the-line activist) idk.  
  
   I know from my own experience that I don't want female friends grabbing their tits unless they want attention (I was with my gf @thetime and our mutual friend would grope herself to the point of me starting to wonder wtf her intentions were)  

  I don't want to be triggered into getting horny. I know that sounds stupid and or weak, but it's horrible, being biologically forced to have your hormones jumpstart your PASS THE GENES mode.
  
 The way my and others' sex drive is, we should be fucking every day, with a partner OR prostitutes or the like (if it became legal it'd be something else..?) I just.
   I don't want to jerk off every morning and lose my energy. It sucks. It's fucking difficult to stop. If you don't have anything you gotta do, like a job or something constantly keeping you occupied, you're ironically fucked.  

At the same time I know and read about others too feeling angry etc when abstinent. Then there are some that share how it made it worse for them to abstain over longer time.  
I just know that it will be good for me, screw it.  

I need to finally be rid of this addiction, because that's what it is. It's my brain going ""do this to achieve joy"" and boom no need to get out and find a girl, just use phone or simply my imagination. No more PMO solo/lonely lifestyle. Use that energy to be an effective go getter of a man."
