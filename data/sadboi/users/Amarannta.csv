sex,ezx56jj,t1_ezwq2ip,1568232312.0,"As a insecure girl who loves to talk about sex, I think this guy is right. If my date doesnt steer the talk to sex in 2 hours it would never cross my mind that he want to have sex, and I wouldnt initiate because of the fear to being rejected. What had worked with/for me is the questions and answers play. You ask one question and then its her turn, you tell her its to know her better. It eventually will slowly lead to sex related stuff. Example:

""Tell me about your first kiss""
""How old were you when you had your first boyfriend?""
""Your first time, was it good?""

And if she ask you the same questions its a good thing. If she chane the subject its a sign that she is not interested.

Hope it helps, and sorry for my english! Good luck."

HisDarkMaterialsHBO,ev80136,t3_cihb1t,1564266879.0,"""When (pretty crappy) The Golden Compass movie came out in 2007, some religious groups boycotted it. This time around, executive producer Jane Tranter isn’t worried. “We’re not concerned because we’re adapting across the board,” she said. “What happens with film, you have to cut down. We have eight episodes per book so we can sound every note that Philip sounded. **We make clear the religious controversy was not relevant to the books.** His Dark Materials talks about oppression, the falsification of information.”


What??? 

Anybody worried about what they will do with the third book if religion supposedly wasnt relevant???"
