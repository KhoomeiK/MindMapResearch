mentalhealth,fqyrhs3,t3_gloapv,1589753344.0,"Hey I know how it feels, I'm 19 with chronic back pain that started when I was 17. My friends never really got it either. I personally joined a Reddit group that is for chronic pain. Whenever I feel like I need to scream to somebody about what I'm going through I just posted that group and they get it. Because they're going through it you know. As for the mental health side of it I'm also struggling, and have been for years. I don't think there's an clear answer on how to be happy. But I do know of a couple things that have helped me day to day. 
I got into a doctor for my chronic pain and she got me on medicine it's not perfect but it's a start. 
I also got into the same doctor for mental health medicine again not perfect but it's a start. 
when this whole quarantine is over and I can see my doctor again I'm going to start seeing a therapist. Because I've become to realize that talking to my loved ones about it doesn't help it makes it worse if that makes sense. Talking on Reddit helps me alot because I feel like understood. 
Don't give up, not now. Give yourself a shot."

I keep thinking I wish I had a better mother, and then at the same time I ask could I have been a better daughter. 
I'm just fighting myself about it."
