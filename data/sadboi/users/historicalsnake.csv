Angel always says her aging physically would be fine with him, but I think it’d impact the relationship a lot. He can never go out in daylight or hold a steady job. Buffy surely doesn’t want to live by the sewers and only go out at night. He drinks blood and they always need to plan for that (I mean go for a trip anywhere and that’s a massive problem. Buffy might decide she would want children, or just mature mentally in general and decide that she doesn’t want to sacrifice this much of her regular, human life.

Reading your comment also made me realize that if Angel ever truly truly wanted to be with Buffy, even realizing that later, he could fight for his soul like Spike did so that being intimate with her wouldn’t trigger it. And he wouldn’t have fed off of her like he did when he was poisoned, especially not ‘til the brink of death."

Or are you afraid you should break up with her because you feel you actually are bisexual leaning heavily towards gay?

If you were doing drugs with her and feel you’ve outgrown her now that both of you are sober, or if you feel mainly attracted to men, these are both good reasons to end the relationship, in my opinion. Hell, any reason that you feel is enough _is_ enough. But do you have other friends and such that know you’re sober now but might be struggling? Because if it’s an ugly breakup you have to be prepared to be okay with losing your primary source of support and not relapse.

Starting a new relationship so early into your recovery isn’t really recommended either.

But I’d love to see you make it many, many, many more days. Just remember if you relapse though, you were strong enough to get clean once and you will be strong enough to get clean again. An addict can become sober if they don’t want to and you’ve tackled that demon before, you know its moves.

Pedophilia is a paraphilia. Paraphilias are classed as “deviant sexual behavior” and things like necrophilia fall under the same category.
Think about it. Your sexual orientation can’t be pedophilia. It’s actually biologically impossible. There are pedophiles who are straight and pedophiles who are gay—which right away shows that it isn’t a word that can be used as a replacement for sexualities."

TrueOffMyChest,fnhllph,t1_fngy39l,1586964642.0,"I’d like to add that actually most pedophiles actually do know it’s wrong and are stuck in a mindset of self hatred. It’s really sad. Of course the media only picks up on those who commit crimes. Plus, who wants their face out there under that label? _Very_ few."
TrueOffMyChest,fnhlaax,t1_fnhg5m7,1586964484.0,"That’s true, you’re right. They never even consider it. A criminal is a criminal is a criminal is a criminal, that mindset especially doesn’t help when a pedophile seeking help hasn’t committed a punishable action. Having someone’s crimes like that made public in today’s society will be something that follows someone for the rest of their life. And yeah, people normalizing the behavior doesn’t help.

True. America also needs prison reform. Like, right now. In my country we have a company of like a few people that’s been in the news a lot because the therapists there, they founded this solely to help pedophiles. And it’s great, in my opinion."
TrueOffMyChest,fngxi68,t1_fngjhq5,1586948573.0,"It is. The general public won’t even get rid of the death penalty and aren’t ready to accept that child sexual abuse stops through helping pedophiles. I think people genuinely forget that this isn’t something people choose to be afflicted with.

Some therapists honestly will sound the alarms and contact the police if a pedophile comes to them for help, which is a genuine problem and scares pedophiles further away from getting help. But there are therapists who genuinely have dedicated their practice solely to help pedophiles."

TrueOffMyChest,fngwu1e,t1_fngiqas,1586947901.0,Sadly a massive amount of pedophiles will struggle with this and end up ending their lives because others aren’t accepting enough or brave enough to say anything besides “fuck pedophiles”. I know it’s really hard for a lot of people to get over but the real solution in this situation is just encouragement to get help and encouragement to keep moving on and see the decline of child sexual abuse.
TrueOffMyChest,fngwe88,t1_fnfwtr2,1586947451.0,">I hope someone is researching how to fix their brains how to fix their brains

People are. Or “fix their brains” sounds like a pretty brutal term but people are researching how through various therapy and means we can help pedophiles overcome this paraphilia (pedophilia is a paraphilia, so is necrophilia, falls under “deviant sexual behavior”) they have & bring the rates of child sexual abuse down.

In all seriousness though none of these people wished or willed it upon themselves. There are people who feel sorrow and self-hatred for even their own thoughts. So don’t group everyone together as supporting this movement."
