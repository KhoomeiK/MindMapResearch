  My day starts with coffee and work from home.  The little ones know to stay close, play, but let daddy work. The older ones help babysit, breakfast, etc...  Ask a question without trying to figure it out and Ill waste your time with cleaning.  Fight, disturb...get out the mop and no one comes out till its clean.  We cut out the mindless chatter and general problems..yeah sounds harsh eh? Lunch, dinner, ok fine thats me or wife.  But afterwards, kids clean up and are expected to shower, brush teeth, bed etc..without my help.  Anywhere I insert myself, homework, bed stories, playing, family time is my choice and no pressure or committment.  Everyone carries the appropriate burden and Im proud my kids will be able to be independent one day.  My kids go to bed at 8ish, then its me and wife chilling watching movies and talking until bed.
