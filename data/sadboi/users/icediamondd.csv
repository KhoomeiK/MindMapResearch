Anxiety,fooqbi2,t3_g8ompi,1587944209.0,"I used to have this A LOT back in last year, but that was because I was in a really shitty situation in my life at that moment. I was terrified and horribly anxious about a particular thing at that time, and also drank quite a lot at that time too. Needless to say it didn't make the situation any better.
 
I'd say consider if anything in your life might be giving you major stress and work on that. There's usually an underlying problem there. And also try to reduce drinking as much as you can. It'll help for sure."

BPD,fojzmgi,t3_g7dt1n,1587832578.0,"100% agree. I'm never gonna recover from my self harm urges or bpd for example and I don't strive to. I definitely strive to be a better person and focus on eating healthy, self-love and positive stuff more, but if I feel overly angry or sad one day I never beat myself up over it, I don't have to do that nor do I want to. I have the right to feel whatever the fuck I feel and you do too. 
 
Don't make traditional ""recovery"" a goal if it's not realistic, it will just make you feel sad if you don't meet those standards. It's a psychological fact if you focus all your energy on a possible failure, you are more likely to fail.
 
I hope that one day I will realise that I no longer meet the criteria for bpd but that's so unlikely. At least right now. I don't care tho. People who love me will love me either way and people who don't, won't fucking matter."
