StopSelfHarm,fqzhqm0,t3_glnvc0,1589767633.0,I’m 21 and still struggle with it. People don’t talk about self harm in adults enough
coolguides,fq76ykh,t3_gh0suw,1589142583.0,"I’d also add back upper arm getting close to your armpit as a painful spot. I got my first tattoo on the back upper part of my arm. I was thinking no way my boyfriend just sat through this for 4 hours without any problem (he got one done the same day) when it was my turn. After I was done the artist said she was surprised I didn’t ask for a break at any point as it’s one of the more painful area and it was my first. I just figured that’s how the felt and all were gonna feel like that. It’s really pinchy. I had extreme muscle fatigue in my arm for a few days after. Couldn’t really pick up anything as I would drop things randomly. 

Tattoo looks awesome. The artist was awesome and super kind in giving me a really good experience for my first"
StopSelfHarm,fp6oqi8,t3_gb4srq,1588355972.0,"Change in clothing is a pretty big one to look out for. Usual wears t shirts but is now wearing nothing but long sleeves, wears shorts but now only pants. These are definitely more so things you’ll see in the summer rather than winter but may still be useful. It’s hard to pick up on self harm. Someone could still wear shorts and and t shirts if it’s on their stomach... If you notice razors that have been taken apart or pencil sharpens, wrappers for Wilkinson Swords... 

I guess you really just need to make sure your kid knows that you are there for them. You won’t judge, won’t get angry. You’ll help them figure things out and listen. I’ve been self harming for 11 years or so (on and off sometime, sometimes everyday)... I started so young the behaviour that the behaviour has become ingrained in my day to day life. I’ve always been so in my head because that kind of relationship has never been established. It’s hard to stop once you start and the longer it goes on the more addictive it gets. 

And if this behaviour comes up it’s not because you were a bad parent. That’s often a conclusion too often jumped to. 

Feel free to send me a message if you have any further questions. ❤️"

AskReddit,fp08dje,t3_gakp3i,1588204396.0,Dreams can be more grounded in reality or the fantastical world of nonsensical dream logic and physics. Whatever ended up leaving a oddly profound effect on you for something that ended up being just a dream.
sex,fp04bcn,t3_gah8oz,1588202231.0,"I’ve had that happen. It makes me not want to post because if I do guys send me their weird porn fantasies... If someone is actually trying to nice and helpful or had a similar thing going on and they want to talk more I don’t mind it, that’s helpful and kind. But please don’t tell me your sexual fantasies I want no involvement in."

sex,focefov,t3_g6muhk,1587670361.0,I find this too. Not even just learning new ways to please your partner but also safe sex and just things about human sexuality.
sex,fnk6j1a,t1_fnk5vea,1587016460.0,"I did some reading and sexual distinction so so common among people with ADHD!!! Men and women exhibit it differently (also really common with ADHD and why women in general are way under diagnosed) but from what I was saying it can effect up to 50% of people with ADHD in some way. I feel like women already have a hard time when it comes to sexual pleasure (did you know on average it takes a women two years to finally orgasm from sex??) and for women with ADHD is an added challenge. 

I’m the biggest sub in town and I feel like the other kinds of stimulation I  get from dom/sub play keep me a little more grounded for sex and that’s why trying to get off myself is such a bore. 

Wild lol. Humans sure are strange

Edit: two year after FIRST having sex"
sex,fnjm465,t3_g1y3kh,1587001864.0,Reading this I totally had a realization. We sound pretty similar. I can’t get there myself though. I get bored and my mind just kinda wanders off. I kinda want to to some reading into this now.
facepalm,fniepna,t1_fniea83,1586978733.0,It’s a reaction video someone made to her videos. Her trying to justify her actions and the other is a story time that I honestly feel she made up for shock value.

suggestmeabook,fni4nsy,t3_g1whdd,1586973912.0,The Patrick Melrose books could be good to try if you haven’t already. They deal with potentially triggering topics though.

sex,fn2777s,t3_fyii7x,1586579771.0,I’m like that too! So is my partner! I love when he takes his jacket off after a long day at work then walking home because he smells so good!! It’s like a wave. I haven’t seen him in three weeks so I’m so excited to see and smell him again when all this is over
sex,fn15nj2,t3_fyhyl4,1586555281.0,"As a queer girl I find the community very...toxic. Not everyone is like this don’t get me wrong. I know plenty of other girls who like girls who are super chill that being said I’ve encountered many toxic people online. I’ve never really been in a serious relationship with another girl before (it was high school and a weird situation), I’ve definitely never done anything sexual. I want to. I’m curious and want to know what that’s like. I’ve only had sex with my current partner who is male. I know some lesbians won’t even give you the time of day if you have so much as kissed a guy. Seems some aren’t a fan of women who aren’t 100% girls only. It’s kinda weird in my opinion. I don’t really get it but that’s just me. I’ve been told by gay women that I’m just straight and want to be “edgy” by saying I’m queer. Girls definitely seem to go more for an all in relationship rather than a hookup. Honestly I wouldn’t mind a one night stand with a girl. I’m definitely on the same page you are. Honestly though I think so if the hostility is more a defence than actually being hateful or anything. Idk. Women are strange creatures lol. And that’s coming from a women."
