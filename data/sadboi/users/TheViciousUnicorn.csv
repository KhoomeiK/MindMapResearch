BipolarReddit,f45xbiw,t3_djeuee,1571399257.0,"I do, but mine is someone completely different. It's more like a actual person I have long drawn out conversations with. Sometimes those conversations are horrible and tell me all the things that are wrong with me and different ways of ending it all. Occasionally that voice just chats with me. I've had it as long as I can remember. I'm not sure how I would feel if it ever went away to be honest."
BipolarReddit,ey80m03,t3_cvzit3,1566907787.0,I've always had ongoing conversations with myself. No matter what state. I've done it as far back as I can remember into childhood.
BipolarReddit,ew6zj8u,t3_cmuj7v,1565183603.0,"I'm a stay at home mom, which sounds like a dream come true for someone who can't deal with working. Then I realized there are no days off. Even on my absolute worst days, I still need to try and function enough to care for 2 small children."
BipolarReddit,evsgmx5,t3_ckvp41,1564745595.0,"Spent about 5 minutes in the shower the other day doing nothing but actually taking a shower. No racing thoughts, no anxiety about what I wasnt accomplishing,  just showering.  Got out and asked my husband if that's how ""normal"" people do things. Apparently it is."
BipolarReddit,evsggdi,t1_evs3f37,1564745406.0,"It took me well into my late teens to realize this wasn't normal.  After a conversation with my best friend who looked at me like I was crazy when I flippantly said, oh well, doesn't everyone start fantasizing about how to kill themselves as a 6 year old? Just thought it was the norm."

Even if I didn't have you I chose you."" Fuck off, you still treated me like shit, just like you did your own children."
BipolarReddit,eumjf5f,t1_eumj9w3,1563916493.0,Thank you!
BipolarReddit,eumja5a,t1_eul5pb2,1563916445.0,"Could be, but definitely something new. My anxiety usually presents itself in a paranoia of sorts. It's very scary and I really hate myself for being this way."
BipolarReddit,eumiyry,t1_eulhrte,1563916326.0,"It's definitely doing that, I haven't had any depression or suicidal thoughts for awhile now. But I feel like I'm spinning out of control. It's so hard to know im acting irrationally and not being able to stop it."
BipolarReddit,euminck,t1_eum7spi,1563916207.0,"That's what I'm most worried about, it being an episode and manifesting with a symptom I've never really had. I really do not want to end up back in the hospital and I will see my dr tomorrow.  Thank you."

BipolarReddit,etgsk15,t3_cbjgsy,1562797955.0,"1. Noticing that my house is filthy and must be cleaned top to bottom. 
2. Start keeping 5 calendars for all the things I'm going to get done!
3. Oh look, it's 3am, I've got 3 more hours to work on this project, or that project or a journal my therapist wants before anyone gets up!
4. Why am I even taking these meds, I feel AMAZING!
5. All the caffeine and alchohol!! These are my true friends!
6. Who needs drs and therapy? I'm fine!
7. The inevitable crash and depression and suicidal thoughts come rolling in, back to drs, back on meds, back to therapy and here we go again..."
AskReddit,etc792w,t1_etb6sz2,1562677446.0,This is so ingrained in me by my mother that even after 10 years of marriage I can't ask my in laws for a glass of water when we are over. It's ridiculous.
AskReddit,etapalg,t3_caiw88,1562625677.0,Call boys on the phone. Even if we were related. Never made a bit of sense to me.
BipolarReddit,et60xl9,t3_ca0ra6,1562500263.0,"I'm definitely more like this when I spiral into depression. Like it's just too much effort for my body to function. When I'm maniac it's more like ""i don't need food! I don't need sleep! I am invincible!!"" So basically the only time I actually eat well is if I'm stable."

BipolarReddit,ertw2cr,t1_ertu5q4,1561255023.0,"Thank you. I hardly ever make it, I just don't know if I really want to find out all the stuff I try to keep buried inside. I usually end up canceling my appointments just to avoid going there."
BipolarReddit,ertev21,t3_c3rwoy,1561240401.0,This week I went to therapy instead of canceling because I didnt want to face whatever was coming.

AskReddit,eqtaol7,t3_bzck4a,1560306919.0,"My kids were about 6 months and just under 2 years old when my father passed, so they really didn't know him well. About 3 months or so after his death my 6 month old was crying in her bed, my 2 year old son comes out and tells me ""When the baby cries, the baby dies."" I was pretty freaked out about that already, but of course asked where he heard that, cause you know it can't get any worse.  Wrong. He follows it up by saying his papaw T (my deceased father) told him that. I almost noped out of there, ready to leave that creepy little kid behind."
AskReddit,eojm6vg,t1_eojbmul,1558639768.0,"Yes! So many people have these miracle ideas of how they would ""fix it"" if they had these disorders. But no, no you really wouldn't. None of ask for this and its treatable, but my Bipolar is not fixable. It's always going to be there. And it's my responsibility to be open with people who will have to deal with the way I sometimes have act without being able to control it. Trust me, I don't want to feel this way or behave this way and i work on it daily, as most of us do. But please, don't tell me what will fix it."
AskReddit,eohvtuv,t3_brzuwa,1558598707.0,"As much as I wouldn't wish my mental illnesses on anyone, there have been many times I wish someone could live in my head for just one day.  The constant thoughts of ways and planning and just running thoughts of suicide and anxiety about the simplest of things is so very exhausting. And as much as I would love to ""just get over it"", it takes a lot of work to feel like what I imagine a ""normal"" person must feel like. Also, I need those meds just as much as a person with heart disease or other chronic illness needs theirs. I cannot function without them and therapy. Stop saying I don't need them!!"
