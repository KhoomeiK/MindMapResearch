dating_advice,fj1dgqy,t3_fazblz,1582917789.0,"Alright, I've done a lot of different psychedelics. Jesus Christ never do morning glory seeds (or salvia). I was curious about them but SO many of my friends had bad experiences with them that I never tried it. I'm talking projectile vomit, complete dissociation (not the good kind), inability to walk, nearly having a seizure. 

Psychedelics are great. They can really open up your mind and change your perspective on things. They're not for everyone, and if you can't handle your partner doing them then that's okay. But please know that she's *incredibly* unlikely to move onto something harder as a result of doing psychedelics. They aren't physically addictive in any capacity (unless you count MDMA/Ketamine as psychedelics but you really shouldn't). 

A single LSD or Psilocybin trip can be life changing. If done in a safe, calm environment with a trip sitter that she trusts, I'm sure she would have a good time. Her trip sitter should probably be somebody who is not you, since she knows your stance on these things and it might make her feel guilty or uncomfortable, which is NOT how you want to feel when you're tripping.

I'm 20 years old now and I've been doing psychedelics since I was 16. I've tried LSD, magic mushrooms, 2CB, DMT, and Ayahuasca. I've done doses of LSD up to 700 mics - 7x the ""standard"" dose. I've done them alone in private, at music festivals, concerts, museums (highly recommend btw), the aquarium, parties, foreign countries, on first dates (!), in front of my parents, and with so many different friends. Hell I've been tripping in front of my boss before. One time I took acid and camped on top of a mountain during a thunderstorm. The overwhelming majority of my experiences have been positive, and the only times I had a bad experience were times that I was simply not in a good place mentally and shouldn't have taken anything. I have done several other, ""harder"" substances as well, but I've never been addicted to anything and I have my life pretty well in order.

All that said, if you're still not comfortable with her experimenting, maybe you should rethink whether this relationship is gonna work for you. You don't want to feel like your partner is going against your moral values and endangering her life, and she doesn't want to feel guilty for doing drugs or like her boyfriend is an authority figure. Best of luck to the both of you."

I suppose this means that I can really free myself now from the idea that we'll get back together.

Borderlands 2 - as far as FPS games go the mechanics in BL2 are not super special, but the story is fantastic and the whole game is just hilarious. It definitely deserves a spot here.

I've had 2 in my adult life, one in my first semester of college that lasted a month and then sorta fizzled out. I was fine with that one ending, I was only upset for a few days.

But man, right now I'm a wreck. I met this absolutely incredible girl on my study abroad semester and we dated for six weeks. She didn't think she could handle long distance so we broke up when I left to come back to the US. I've never felt so happy with anybody in my life. We had so much in common, we respected and appreciated each other. We built each other up and we would do everything together. 2.5 weeks ago it ended and I've cried every day since. The part that sucks the most is neither of us wanted it to end, we just knew that it had to. 

We still want to be friends but I need more time before I'm ready for that, so we aren't talking right now. The truth is I don't want to be just friends, I want to move back to Australia and continue being in love, but there's really no way that can happen right now.

depression,fc1r7hu,t3_efpe4v,1577327146.0,"Psychedelics are all about set and setting. If either your mindset or your physical environment are uncomfortable when you take them, you could have a potentially damaging experience. Sometimes those experiences can help you grow as a person the most, but you still *really* don't want to have them, trust me. It's much better to take them in a place that you are comfortable and when you are in a decent mood.

I have taken many doses of different psychs in my time, namely DMT, LSD, psilocybin, 2CB, and once ayahuasca. They have certainly affected my development through my adolescent years (I'm 20 now), but they have not in any way cured my depression.

What psychedelics do is give you a different perspective on life. They allow you to think outside of yourself and often be more logical about your problems. I do believe that they can be helpful to those with depression, and I would certainly say they've benefited me, but you have to be careful that you're not just using them as an escape from reality.

Also, it's very important to reflect on your experiences. If you take mushrooms, trip your balls off for 8 hours, and then just go about your next day as though nothing happened, you're not going to absorb the experience very well. You really need to think critically about how you felt on the mushrooms, **while sober**. It's usually best to wait at least two weeks between trips, especially for tolerance reasons.

I hope this helps, sorry for the wall of text."
