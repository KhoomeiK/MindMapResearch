biglittlelies,f219b80,t3_db3nrw,1569869479.0,"I think there's a clue in a scene where Bonnie is in the kitchen and Nathan comes from running and eats a bowl of cereal. She said something like ""how can you eat that stuff, it's bad"" (knowing that she is probably a vegetarian/organic type of person) while she eats fruit and something more. I think  there's the clue, those two are so different. She is more alternative and he's just ""normal"". I think she kind of force herself to love him as he is sweet, kind and loves her, but at the end, with the ""no more lies"" policy to her life, she realized she isn't really in love with her. And there are other things you can think of, like what Bonnie's mom says to her, the differences that they had in raising children."

AmItheAsshole,f036snh,t3_d3jfs2,1568346369.0,"YTA - Not because you were upset by that, but because you think that if you pay for a meal you have any kinds of rights. Yeah, it's rude to ignore someone you have in front of you, but that's no the way to put it."
relationship_advice,f02nd5n,t3_d36bvg,1568334319.0,"I really encourage you to look for some advice in other sub, because here everyone is monogamous and shaming. Giving this advice I think: your wife may be not ""tired"" of sex, maybe she discover she's asexual. Any counseling or therapist couldn't change that, she doesn't want it and you have to understand that's ok, you have not only to comprehend the idea but embrace it. On the other hand it's ok for you to feel bad and trapped in a relationship where there's lack of something you need. Talk to her and propose an open relationship in terms of sex. If you are 100% sure you love her, you don't need to be closed to that idea. Go to a therapist that can give you advice in non monogamous life style. That maybe something."

First let him tell you how he feels about you having feelings for him, then, tell him that your BF already know (because he may be upset about the ""cheating"" thing) and then told him that you want to go out with him and know him better., but I think the words ""join the relationship"" could be scary for him, especially because you're saying he isn't poly or even think about it"
