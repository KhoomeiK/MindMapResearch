BPD,f4k5njg,t3_dktvds,1571636410.0,"I went through this. I went through it for so long, so many times, and in so many relationships. 
Here is what I have learned: 

Some of your needs some of the time are irrational and overbearing. You are sometimes sensitive and bitchy about some things that don’t or shouldn’t matter. See the pattern? 

However, they are also sometimes toxic, heartless, abusive, manipulative, provocative and triggering. Sometimes they are fucking with your head. 

The truth is that no matter what skills you learn and what strategies you develop, it only takes a little bit of toxic, provocative, abusive, manipulative BS to trigger you. You can make a lot of progress but if triggered, you will backslide right into “pre-skills and tools you” when on the receiving end of said BS. 
The key to overcoming this is to only be with someone who does not do these things. Someone who listens and hears. Someone who is patient. Someone who values and respects you, themselves, and what you are trying to build together. 

This has been my experience and what I have learned in the last two years. This is what I now believe.  The patient, respectful person isn’t something to worry about now. Realizing that any bit of abuse or toxicity at all will compromise all the good work you do /is/ important right now.
 
I wish you the best.
