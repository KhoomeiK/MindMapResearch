AmItheAsshole,fnz3jbk,t3_g4k4zu,1587385048.0,"YTA. Why couldn't you just calmly ask her about the altar and everything on it? You could have used a conversation to get her to open up and happily share her new beliefs with you, she would probably even be happy that you asked. 

If you found it was something you were uncomfortable with you could have explained your view. Handling it the way you have, you've immediately turned it into a confrontation and made her feel ashamed and defensive."

And nothing specific with the light blue colour, not that I can think of anyway!"
DreamInterpretation,fm7ul83,t1_fm7tsbu,1585837085.0,"I can't remember them looking like any specific species, but they looked similar-ish to either a cardinal/tit/finch of some sort. Sorry it's so vague!

And they were both a light blue colour."
Dreams,fm7u15n,t1_fm7se9h,1585836748.0,"Thank you for the response! I'll try and add some more details now.

When I walk through the woods during the day they make me slightly anxious, but not overly so. In the dream I was walking to get home and it suddenly grew really dark, and I felt very scared, so I started to hurry. 

I knew the bird was injured because it was on it's back on the floor and it was trying to fly away, the other bird was hopping around it and flapping its wings. There were broken branches on the floor surrounding the bird.

I remember I suddenly stopped being scared of the dark and instead felt worried for the bird and went over - like I sort of ignored how dark it was at that point.

Birds are close to my heart in general, and tend to remind me of my home and family, because my mum has always taught me about birds and I've always watched them in the garden. 

They seemed nervous to begin with when I ran up, but then stopped and just stared at me. The second bird could have flown away, but didn't. I remember thinking the second bird (the one that wasn't injured) seemed to be happy to see me almost, like a warm feeling?

I also remember thinking that, even though the stick was in the birds chest, it didn't seem overly hurt or in pain. It just couldn't fly away and I was worried it would die."

AmItheAsshole,f3019qq,t3_devz7y,1570544046.0,"NTA. I'm vegetarian, and I jokingly said that if I got drunk enough I might end up eating meat by accident. My friends immediately said that they wouldn't let me do that and would stop me if I was too drunk to realise myself. These girls clearly aren't friends if they think tricking you into eating meat is funny.

And like other's have said, you shouldn't mess with people's food."

Psychosis,esh8ljs,t3_c7rvji,1561986104.0,"Hey there! I was introduced to the Early Intervention team when I was about 14 (now 21) and I was with them until I turned 18. 

From my experience, they came round to my house every other day, and the first thing they did was discuss my symptoms, my every day life, my past, and anything that could possibly link to my illness. I ended up seeing a psychiatrist, and then a psychologist through their referrals, which resulted in me having medication and several months of therapy from the psychologist. 

The EI team did a lot of cognitive behavioural therapy type stuff with me as well, which actually did help a lot. They also taught me coping mechanisms, took me on days out to get me out of the house and suggested groups that might help me. 

It is daunting when you're first referred to them, and it can be quite full on. But their main goal is to get you the help you need and ultimately stop you from getting worse. I was later diagnosed with depression and generalised anxiety disorder, but I had psychotic symptoms when I was at my worst. 

I hope this helps a little, and I'm here if you want to ask anymore questions. Good luck with it all!"
