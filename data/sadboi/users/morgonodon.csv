mentalhealth,fqx5z9d,t3_glg2xn,1589726561.0,"Here’s a couple of thoughts:

I can imagine someone said it was bad because you are disconnecting from the present, from what your actually doing and feeling in the moment. I would wonder the underlying reason as to why you are dissociating in the first place? Is it to disconnect from people or disconnect with the feelings associated with something/people? I guess I would be concerned dependent on why you are dissociating in the first place. I mean, dissociation has been determined by some to be an unhealthy coping skill, but to me, I have seen it to sometimes to be the only thing that works to make yourself safe. It is typically associated with trauma. 

If it works for you, I get it! It’s hard to say no to something that has worked and felt good. But when it gets to a point when it happens involuntarily or for reasons that are mere escaping, that would of concern I suppose."

addiction,fqclsz9,t3_gi04xt,1589261674.0,"I think all of the things said make for a good addictions counselor, but honestly, I’ve found that showing the willingness to sit with someone and provide empathy, care, genuineness, and unconditional positive regard for them as they are in that moment is just as, if not more, important than the amount of “stuff” you know. There are some people who have never had a supportive, loving relationship with another person and if you be with and see that person for who they are, then your on the way. It takes a lot to sit with someone who is struggling with substance use and will be challenging at times, but just “show up” and they will be more willing to show up too.

Also, not to be this person, but substance abuse is an outdated term and it’s more appropriate to use “substance use or dependence”.

Good luck with exploring this career option!"

I am grateful to have had my therapist in such a challenging time and I can only see it as a benefit to you.

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it forever. You are more than the hair on your head/body. WAY more. You are a beautiful human and your hair has nothing to do with it.

But to be honest, as much as it blows, it feels like it’s getting better. I don’t cry everyday about it which is a bonus.

I started taking finasteride and haven’t seen much effect, except in the last two days I have been peeing like a madman (so maybe it’s starting to show some of the signs of working?) I started using minoxidil and it had been 27 days. So here’s hoping.

I hope the things that you’re doing help and that you are taking care of yourself. Sounds cliche, but it’s the most important thing.

I wish you all the luck for your biopsy. My fingers will definitely be crossed for you. 

I have been scared to do the apple cider vinegar only because I don’t want to irritate my scalp more. I’ve noticed that when I don’t condition, I get really inflamed. So I assume the “dryness” is causing irritation, which could happen with the vinegar. I’ll have to try it once to see if it helps. I’m also trying to get out of the everyday scalp wash right now.
