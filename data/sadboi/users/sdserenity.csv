They never did understand how much fire, and magic the electric guitar brought me.  My father disapproved the overstimulating secular rock I would find on the web.  Radio.  The attempt at listening to such genre would always send me to my room for a timeout.  Like I sinned, and grieved his biblical ""God"".  I was behind on the new sound as the newly adopted tolken Jesus boy who would bring glory to their Bible God. I remember putting together a band at their Church.  Our first show my new father threatened to not let me play because my heart was not in the right place for Jesus.   As a  15 year old, it was a stab in my back.  I think he got off his Jesus power by flexing his control over my efforts.  -but not that day, because I probably would have sucked his dick to get what I wanted.  Eventually they deemed me unfit for their family, and sent me away after claiming that God picked me to be their new son from the heart of the USSR.  

Today I am homeless, and am fighting my addiction to drugs.  I am still workin on it.  I am still playing, and putting effort in bringing success to my life through the ridicule, judgment, and maybe even spite of others.  I've become better, and faster, and more entertaining with my guitar.  I am going for that big sound.  That billboard welcome to your beautiful city sound.  That true Rockstar experience that America urns for.  Something to inspire generations who come well after we have moved on.  May the Gods pave a way for the life I dream of.  May I serve by quenching their thirst of that feeling which can not be put into words, but could only be felt through music.  May the sound of freedom resound throughout all corners of our earth as we float through this galaxy.  No, I don't regret my chosen path, and I'll meet you on the stage.  Thanks for letting me share,

Everywhere that particular night some hired security guard would come out of no where and tell me I'm ""trespassing"".  It was torturous to the point of loosing my sanity.  Then I also remembering being hired by the local business association to be a beat security guard for them.  My job was to remove the homeless folks on the street who were bothering businesses.  I was very good at my job and had a lot of pride removing ""them"".  Now at 33 years old, and going on 8ish years of homelessness.  It is one of my biggest regrets to have been a security guard working for the rich.  It is one of unknowingly worst decisions I have ever made in my life.  To this day, when I see a rentacop, I want to mop the asphalt with his ignorant cranial bucket.   Now I know more about the world than 10 years ago.
