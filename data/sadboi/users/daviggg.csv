What you’re doing by discriminating against transgender people is just so ironic for someone who so avidly supports the Republican Party. How can you call yourself a conservative, or even an American while you speak out against the basic morals of both things? Being a trans person is obviously not against nature, it’s obviously part of the pursuit of happiness, and most importantly it’s none of your fucking business."

You and your backwards ideal on things that don’t affect you in the slightest are a disgrace to America. If someone wants to change their gender how in the fuck could that possibly harm you?
