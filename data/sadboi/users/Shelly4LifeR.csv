But after smelling dogs, hearing them bark all the time.  I decided it would increase all my problems.  Worse is someone keeps trying to get me to foster a puppy.  Puppies need lots of time and training.  I'm pretty sure that would increase my stress.  I hope your husband will understand and let you rehome the dog.  Good luck!"

So sad, should of thought of that before bed time.  (There wasn't always food in the house so it wasn't like I didn't think of it before bed time, there just wasn't anything to eat.)  

Have to use the bathroom?  Should have thought of that before drinking so much water before bed.  (As long as I walk very quietly and didn't flush the toliet I wouldn't get caught.  Luckily I had hand sanitizer in my room for washing my hands.)"
Dogfree,fki855f,t1_fkha2g8,1584213887.0,I hate that!  I don't have birds but I did before and I cared for them a lot.  Saying they're just chickens.  I don't get it.  Chickens have more value then dogs anyway.  I doubt they'd like it if it was reversed.  I hope they stop letting their dogs go over to your home.

Like you I have someone who fosters dogs and she wants me to foster them or puppies.  Like I want a puppy chewing everything up all the time.  As it is she has potty pads all over her house.  Some of them used.

Why would I want my house to stink of dog and piss?"

I also felt relief which made me feel guilty.  Relief of knowing she couldn't make fun of me anymore.  That I wouldn't have to take care of her anymore.  That I could walk through the house without fear of her saying something hurtful yet again.  And relief she was no longer in pain.  Even though she never cared about my pain I hated that she was in pain."

I think the dog belongs to my neighbors but they are dog nutters.  Their dogs do no wrong and can go wherever they want too.

raisedbynarcissists,fatr2y1,t3_eajjcz,1576340821.0,Instead of me she said she hoped I'd have children just like my brother so I know how hard it is to raise a child.  For one he wasn't that bad.  For two most of his faults were because of the way she treated us.  I was the one who took care of him most of the time.  I made sure he ate.  She homeschooled both of us.  I was in third grade when she decided that and he just finished kindergarden.  She got bored with it and I was the one trying to teach him everything.  Not to mention trying my best to learn since she thought homeschooling was getting us the books and that was that.  Thanks to that I feel stupid.  Have real trouble with social interactions.  And didn't even feel proud of myself when I got a diploma later on in life.
