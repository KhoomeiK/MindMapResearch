Also Giannis said he would go and talk to Masai during a game of golf, as a joke if the Raptors beat the Bucks last season, as well as him saying if the Bucks can’t win before his F/A he will have a hard time resigning and wants to go a team who has a winning culture.

Not that the Bucks are not a winning team."

torontoraptors,fp3zbo3,t1_fp3wujo,1588288647.0,"He’ll probably sign a 2 year for less than he’s worth. He said he’s willing to take a pay cut because of reduced cap. The only way I think he leaves is if someone offers something ridiculous, which would probably be the Knicks! 

There’s an article somewhere of him saying he’s not worried about a few million dollars, because he’s already so much more wealthy than he was as a kid.

Nick Nurse also said that he wants to increase the value in his players in the market place or else where.
I’m assuming this is why players like Pascal, Norm, Freddy, Serge have their own clothing lines or other products. I’m sure he’ll have some loyalty for all that, and if not we’ll find someone else. Nick Nurse has already improved two bench players into stars and is doing the same with Davis, and Norm as well as getting Lowry and Ibaka playing some of the best ball of their career in their 30s."
