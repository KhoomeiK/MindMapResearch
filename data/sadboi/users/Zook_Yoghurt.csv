> I like that you are real, honest and kind. Height isn’t a problem. And I do know how tall people are there. Trust me, there’s a girl sitting at home wishing someone would love her for just her. 

Wow...just...thank you. I'm so happy to hear you say that! Ooooh, if only I could find that special someone, and love her so much...man, I'd do anything for the girl I'd get in a relationship with - I'd give her the world if I had too. I'm a real sappy romantic I guess haha.

But thank you so much. I will try my very best. I makes me relieved in a way i guess to know I'm not the only one. You seem like a great mom - I'm sure your kids are glad to have you! I'm only 19 and still live with my mom so your comments hit extra close to home, in a good way. :)

And you're right, ideally one shouldn't look to become reliant on others for validation, but man is it hard. Especially because I've trained myself to be more acutely socially aware by listening to feedback from other people/mostly neurotypicals on how good my behavior was when it came to fitting in or acting normally. I'm also just a cuddlebug and lovebug by nature, so I guess I just really value people's opinion of me, for better and for worse hehe.

TrueOffMyChest,fpecerk,t1_fpe9z6t,1588544739.0,"Thank you. I am so glad to hear of a positive experience from a fellow aspie. Even if I never make to that point in life (for unfortunate or more morbid reasons), I just want to say congratulations for coming so far. It's so not easy to get together with someone when you have aspergers, man or woman, doesn't matter. I'm happy that you got married and got some beautiful kids, hell, the fact that you have had two relationships is admirable in and of itself.

Thank you for your kind words. I try and will try not to, but damn is it hard. I hope am I loveable, but sometimes it feels very hard for me to attain that - I probably shouldn't be posting this on this account but screw it; I was ranting on r/rant a few days ago, and in here comes this beautiful girl and writes to me in my DMs and cheers me up. We talk, and figure out that we have soooo many similar interests over the next few days. We quickly realize - I think it was me first, but I dunno which one of it was, tbh - that we've fallen for each other and we declared our love for one another. It was so pure and genuine, I had never felt anything like it in my life. This girl was everything I had ever wanted in a girl or more. I almost felt like I didn't deserve her, she was that good. I don't believe in God, but that ray of sunshine that girl brought into my life when I was down made it hard for me to think of her than anything other than an angel. Unfortunately, due to personal matters I won't get into, it just couldn't work out. We didn't get mad at each other at all, she let me down in the best fashion possible - a dream girl, man, she really was/is. It wasn't this relationship in particular not working out that made me fall over the edge - it was just realizing this was the first time a girl had made me feel this way, told me she loved me, I felt powerful, validated, cared for, maaan fuck it felt good. I would have given that girl the world if she asked me to. I guess I'm just a person who through nature and/or nurture is a lovebug and would love nothing more than to make people happy. Anyways, I just feel like that would never happen again. I'm short (5'8/5'9) for my country (6ft on average) and I have never been given any attention by a girl here at home in Denmark, at least nothing which amounted to anything close to romantic being merely just teasing. I have sacrificed so much of myself to be considered normal, that I don't even know who I am anymore (I think - I don't even KNOW if I don't even know who am anymore haha), and I am not that attractive and my voice is high-pitched. I guess a girl here at home will never truly want me, sexually. And it's the ONE thing, coupled with a fulfilling, wholesome relationship, where my partner and I love each others' personality and mannerims which I wanted since I was like, 12, or something. I'm afraid it will never happen to me due to these factors AND the fact that I'm a boy, so I'm expected to do the approaching.

I don't want to wait until I'm 28 or 30 to experience love for the first time and be someone's third, fourth or last pickings or choice to settle down with solely for economic reasons. I don't want to be an outsider all my life. I wanna have a normal friend group with neurotypical people, go to parties, meet new and interesting people, and have the social competence to get things going between me and a cute, nice girl. But I don't think that'll ever happen. My class is a special-ed class of sorts and half the girls there are lesbian or transgender, meaning they're off the table for anything non-platonic.

If I have to wait, or accept such pitiful terms, I'd rather just die. I don't wanna go to heaven, I don't deserve that. Children and people who die in warfare, starve to death, women and girls who get trafficked and men who work themsleves to death for their families deserve that. I don't know if I think I deserve hell, maybe I do. But if there is a god, and if it's possible he can hear my wishes, I only have one wish: once I die - no matter when or how that may happen - I hope for eternal rest, and eternal peace.

If you've read all of this, thank you. You have no idea how much that means to me.

If OP genuinely means that, for example, that victims of sexual assault should always be empathetic to sexual assailants, then I would agree; that’s fucked up. But frankly, I don’t think they do. The “always” part was probably somewhat hyperbolic. This isn’t overlooking some kind of obvious neo-Nazi dogwhistle (the 13/50 one, for example), it’s just not assuming the worst in people. 
I DO think it’s sad if you read this much negativity into what is essentially a post talking about giving the socially inept and disenfranchised the benefit of the doubt. You can, of course, say me interpretation is too lenient, and that’s fair. I guess I can understand that. But if that’s the case, there’s nothing to do but leave it at that.

Inceldom is something I want to solve, and to do that one needs to deal with or overcome their depression or feelings of ineptitude. I understand and agree with the idea that one's validation shouldn't come from external experiences - but we are social animals and we are affected by the world around us. No man (or woman) is an island, and in a world where sex is everywhere, these feelings are bound to boil over in the hearts of many - self-declared incels or not. Personally, I have no intention of letting civillity and the occasional moment of pity be the most I'll get out of being an incel - I want to change.

If we want to solve this problem (and by ""problem"" I mean depression, suicidality, ect.) brought about by feeling like an outsider or lacking validation as a sexual being we need to be willing to tackle the societal issues and tendencies which have gotten us to this point.

Therefore, I don't appreciate you using ""justify"" as in being sad about not being sexually validated is somehow wrong (sorry if I'm reading too much into it, but it comes across that way). Based upon how society and our biological make-up is, trying to not be a virgin is a valid thing. The same goes for, say, not being overweight or not having bad hygeine. These are things you can change, but it is difficult. Once you're overweight, for example, it can be hard to lose that weight due to bad habits and fear of going to the gym, failure, mockery ect. So I sympathize with those who find themselves stuck in a rut or without motivation - but since I'm probably more on top happiness-wise than the vast majority of incels, I can assure you, I'll try to do something. Small things like shining a spotlight on these issues is what I'll try to do.

Sorry man, I agree with almost everything you're saying, but I'm going to have to disagree on the fact that seeing virginity as a problem **is itself** a problem.

Be sure to hit me up if you feel like discussing this more. Cheers.

IdiotTears,fnsmhkl,t1_fnqxi6n,1587224631.0,Let’s unpack this sweaty
IdiotTears,fnqd67w,t1_fnq8ybb,1587162290.0,"Thank you for your comment, there is a lot here to take in and reflect on here. I think you’ve described how many incels spiral into helplessness aptly. I’m sorry if this isn’t your intent, but I have many “incel” friends in real life, and we often talk about our shared struggles. We aren’t mysognistic, we are left-leaning (social democrats) and since we all have Aspergers we know what’s it’s like not to be accepted by society for who you are. My friends have never shown ANY dislike for me pushing for more economic and social equality. There are many incels that simply aren’t active online or identify under the banner (for obvious reasons, coughincels.coelliotrodgerworshipcoigh) but are still virgins despite their efforts not to. I appreciate your reassurance that sex isn’t necessary for a healthy life, and, on paper, for some people, I agree. However, sex is something we have a biological urge to do. It is in our DNA. Sex is everywhere in the media, our movies, games, literature, music and art. Sex and marriage have and are still seen as qualifiers for adulthood or being respectable (India, China, parts of Africa, Central America and Eastern Europe for example). So while I think a good dose of incels would LIKE not to feel this need for sex and companionship, I would argue it is VERY natural. But where I agree with you is that, of course, wallowing in your misery won’t fix anything. So while I can’t speak for others, MY goal is to bring awareness to the loneliness and depression felt being young people and old people alike across social classes, countries and cultures and how an appearance-based culture which often denies its own prominence or even existence is what we need to tackle to get to the core of this issue. 
I want to reclaim the word “involuntarily celibate” from the clutches of racists and bigots. I may only be 19, but even with English as a second language I hope I can do my part to at least somewhat eloquently being forth issues very close to my heart (autism, inceldom, loneliness) and I have no intention of stopping that, online detractors from incels.co or IncelTear-esque spaces be damned. 
If you’ve read all this, thank you for your time. Hope your Friday’s going great. Expect to see more posts from me on this sub on how we can actively work on inceldom and fix the shattered minds of those who suffer from it while keeping bigotry and such at bay. 
Peace from Denmark"
IdiotTears,fnq0mrm,t1_fnppy6c,1587155439.0,">You are legitimately the first ever incel that has said that to me. The only one. In spite of the comments I’ve received from incels from my participation in inceltears and here, you are the actual first incel that has straight up cut the bullshit responses and plainly told me “I will report misogynist/racist content” without some kind of lane excuse.  
>  
>The most common excuses I’ve gotten is “I can’t stop people from saying what they want to say”, “reports don’t work”, or “I’m not a moderator”,

Bruh...that's legitimately sad. Incels - at least I would argue - are a marginalized community. We should at least stick with other marginalized groups like POC, women (especially in 2/3rd world countries) and the disabled. It's the least we can do (or at least what I would do). 

I tried to convert people away the Jewish Question and facist-esque thought on shortcels. I hope I can continue to do the same here and promote equality and positivity for all."

IdiotTears,fnpnh16,t1_fnmsssy,1587148598.0,"Doesn't mean we should entertain the idea of brigading a sub trying to promote (more) open dialogue, my dude. It's childish and uncalled for. If you want people to not treat incels like a joke, then don't give them a reason to. It's that simple."
IdiotTears,fnpn7ql,t1_fnoshe5,1587148466.0,"Sorry for not being on reddit enough to consistently catch a bannable post and report it. Inb4 ""incels have no lives"". I'd wager many of us are doing something else instead of browsing or posting on reddit or incel subs most of the day. 

Doesn't change the fact that I'll report mysogonistic/racist content when I see it, though."
IdiotTears,fnpmq1i,t1_fnor3pk,1587148218.0,"No need to use harsh language my dude. This platform isn't essential to our lives, it's just cool that it exists. Ban threats for not ""staying in good faith"" (whatever that means) is not really scary either. If anything, incels getting banned will prove IT-detractors' points that incel-critical subs operate out of kneejerk-reactions and generalizations. Easy there champ."
IdiotTears,fnoqtd0,t3_g31ywm,1587131734.0,"Very based. Good job mods, your decisions and moderation choices seriously gives fine hope for a brighter future for dialogue between incels and non-incels. I hope IdiotTears can become what IncelTears failed so hard at: a place of dialogue and understanding."
IdiotTears,fnoqkq8,t3_g2ytpw,1587131588.0,"Based. I stick around on IdiotTears because I feel like an attempt to reach across the aisle from both sides is consistently undertaken. The mods have been improving and self-reflecting more on this sub’s rules and behavior in the past few days than IncelTears did in its entire lifespan. 
I suspect r/IncelTear will not be much better than its decommissioned big brother, unfortunately."
IdiotTears,fnmg5hs,t3_g2moxi,1587070827.0,"Bruh I'm an incel but that last comment is just cringey. Why do people go on these overdramatic tirades? Women like tall guys (a lot) more than short men and often settle for shorter men out of economic necessity. That's it. No need to start a second Crusade Against Womankind or something lmao.
