I know gut feeling may be the wrong word, but rest assured I will not just claim intersex without proper diagnostic information. Its little things like the gender marker set to ""I"" and some other things which make me question that it may be a good idea to get testing done.

I'll see about getting full records as well, and yes totally, intersex is not a purely chromosomal thing but I figured it'd be the only viable testing I could do at this point.

Thank you so much for the advice, and know that I'll not just claim something until I know a bit more.

""I'm doing this because I love you.""  
""I had no choice.""  


Anyone who's gotten out of an abusive relationship will remember those words. Anyone who's been in one will remember how convinced they were that their partner loved them. Pearl was never given the chance to heal, her song about being fine with the other men is definitely showing she was never fine with them, I'd definitely say she was trying to convince herself.  


Pearl never had a chance to move on, she never had a chance with anyone by Rose, we never explored her healing with mystery girl. Pearl has been done such a massive disservice, and people who defend Rose are strangely doing what lots of people do whenever someone tries to stand up for another's abuse.  


Like I've said, I love the show, but I see this as Rebecca's biggest blunder. I'm still a huge fan of her art, I got to meet an artist who signed off her work and had an absolute fangirl moment as he called my work awesome. I've watched interviews, been so happy for the representation, some of the shows best messages about mindfulness, being queer and dealing with relationship difficulties and the pressure put on femme presenting people is all solid.  


But the Rose/ Pearl dynamic is a classic romanticization of a ""loyal"" partner no matter how badly they are treated. I'll repeat, the show has great messages, but the undertones of the Rose/ Pearl dynamic are very dark indeed. You don't have to love everything about a show, infact being critical about a show is part of caring about it. I want good representation of the rainbow alphabet, but as writers we have to be very careful of the narrative we perpetuate.  


I don't think this was intentional, infact, I theorized that Rose was Pink in S2 for some reason. But without seeing how awful it would be upon reflection.  


I hope none of you are ever treated the way Rose treated Pearl."

Both Blue and Yellow felt really deeply for Pink, I'd definitely agree that White was essentially Satan comparatively.

The rest of the Diamonds were far more heinous than Rose ever was for sure, but I never got the feeling her hands were as tied as she says. She still held much power and could have used her skills in subterfuge to change her colony's views rather than turning it in on itself. 

I think people misunderstood that my head cannon of Rose realizing she could never escape her upbringing so giving her power to her son would be a way to end the conflict, someone who could actually experience humanity. I'd think this would be her best act hands down."

Even if they didn't she still held power over her colony, the most she'd get was a reprimand. Her hands weren't tied. If they didn't care then they wouldn't have noticed her making a change. Rose was good at subterfuge for certain, she could have easily quietly pulled strings without causing a war.

>Pearl following Rose is always a choice, it was neither an order nor any programming. The crew confirmed this.

This'd definitely be a case of authorial intent vs interpretation of the content, ""death of the author"" is an ongoing debate. I will say that simply having the crew ""say"" something, doesn't suddenly make it cannon.

>Woah woah there. No idea where you got the notion that Rose was doing any of this on purpose?

I'm not sure ""I didn't abuse and use you on purpose"" is a solid defense.  


Edit: It just dawned on me, what exactly would Pearl have done if she left Rose? A Pearl abandoning her Diamond? There would literally be no place for her at all."
stevenuniverse,f0vbthh,t3_d6k9vo,1568975260.0,"Here's my take:  


I love this show, but the Rose Quartz plot twist really displayed a callous disregard for life and manipulation that changed her from this all loving figure into a horrifying being who only thinks of her own interests.  
After seeing the destruction gem colonization does creating a fake war damaged the planet and pitted gems against each other in a fake war.  
Acting as a diamond she'd have absolute authority over her colony, should the other diamonds have acted the same way while she was changing the gems on her colony's outlook on life, that wouldn't have been on her but her actions pretty much ensured the obliteration/ corruption of gems in her colony by creating a war and by faking her own death, she doomed Earth. She knew how much the diamonds loved her, her death was very much going to invoke a reaction from them, being the powerful beings they were it wouldn't have taken much guessing to assume what they would have done.  


Pearl's cautious advice was often overruled for whatever Rose wanted to do... and speaking of Pearl:  


It really bothers me that Pearl was subservient to Rose, there was a huge imbalance in the power dynamic between them. Pearl truly loved Rose but had no say in anything, she still is reserved in the series, as constant battle for her own sense of self and confidence, we can see this was even more present in the memories between Pearl and Rose/ Pink. Rose never treated Pearl with nearly the same amount of love, and the fact that Pearl obeyed Rose wasn't a sign of her breaking the mould of Pearls, she was just listening to her diamond, and never once is it presented as a choice. Rose knew Pearl would do anything for her and used it, but also constantly pushed her aside for her own ambitions/ love pursuits. With full knowledge it'd hurt Pearl, there was no negotiation of polyamoury so Rose basically tossed Pearl's feelings aside constantly until she needed her.  


Even worse, that Rose either intentionally or obliviously used Pearl's love and trust to get her to do whatever she wanted. Never mind how much Pink's death fucked up Jasper and many other loyal gems, this act was a catalyst for hate. I struggle to see anything Rose/ Pink did to Pearl and many other gems as anything but abuse and genocide.

If I was Sapphire I'd probably have left crying too and never come back, I'd totally see my love and everything about who I was as a lie. 

Then she leaves the world she destroyed up to Steven to fix somehow, not telling him who he really was. Leaving him to overcome challenges of an unheard of existence. Steven isn't ""like his mother"" in any way, he's far beyond anything she was, he's actually kind, he's actually empathetic, he attempts never to disregard anybody's love for him, he sees the good in everyone. All qualities Rose was supposed to have but didn't.  


The only saving grace here is that Rose/ Pink may have realized she couldn't have been better and that the only way to save the galaxy/ universe from the Kryptonian style authoritarian destruction gems brought to planets was to create Steven, a being who could actually have compassion and understand pain and humanity.  


TL;DR: The only thing Rose/ Pink Diamond ever did of value was stop existing."

I've worked with a lot of trimeresurus. They're incredibly docile unless food is present.Those heatpits are no joke though, get a finger in range and they may mistake it as ""something warm"" and bite, but usually pretty relaxed. They can strike about a full body length if they need to.

The babies are hectic though, always biting. And heaven help you if you have to tube feed them if they're not eating, being gentle but firm with a head of your index finger while necking is dangerous as heck and they will bite through their lower jaw to get you.

Venom isn't too bad, then again ""isn't too bad"" is you'll lose a finger. Bite on the neck will go to the brain quickly and potentially break the blood-brain barrier, which is pretty instant death though. Plenty of good anti-venom for them though.

My scaling of ""isn't too bad"" is warped having worked with animals that'll melt your leg to the bone in seconds or kill you in 15 minutes though. Kinda why I'm not working with them at the moment.

TombRaider,ewrcoyc,t1_eworouq,1565701992.0,"Artist here:

I think you have a good eye, but you're mistaking technical errors as an equivalent to bad. The thing is, getting a few things wrong doesn't make something bad. Its also a learning experience.  
If you'd like to give feedback on art I'd suggest this kind of format:

What I liked first:

This would make great box art for a game!

The flicks of embers in the background fading into a foggy mist, with painterly trees giving a sense of depth as they lose detail moving back. The ember light and colours gradually falling the background gives a strong sense of lighting. The light from these embers creating a rim light on Lara and mixing with her skin tone.

The attention to details in her clothes and on the animals is fantastic, the way clothing folds, wraps and distorts is fantastic, the bandages have a tensity to them, implying they're tightly wrapped. Even the small etchings of the bow being caught in the light is great. The translucent, and dried areas of blood don't overwhelm the already tensely detailed figure.

The way the straps and buckles sit on the figure has a sense of gravity to them.

There's a cool secondary light making Lara pop out of the scene.

Things that aren't quite working:

There's little sense of grounding, there aren't shadows reacting to her position or the wolves from where there's an established light source. The wolves would have more blown out yellow area on the rim of their fur, a few off colour white strands of fur would go a long way to making them pop without ruining the scene. There should be a slightly darker area on the fingers that are wrapped around the bow.

Your points on storytelling in an image are great! There's definitely a sense of inconsistency in the scene due to having Lara hold all of her signature items. This can come out great but the balancing is off and it makes it feel cluttered. The framing of the bow going off-screen means the composition isn't quite there and adds to it feeling ""cluttered"" while not having that much information.

There are some slightly off proportions in the face, the nose area doesn't feel quite right, her left arm is slightly bigger than her right. The hair is a little too solid for the style, it needs some added translucency where those areas are being hit directly by the embered light.  


Besides the shadow and composition work these are all nit picks, the thing that's really out of place is the pose and proportions. There's a stiffness in the pose, every part of Lara looks tensed up, and this isn't how people stand in real life. Even in a tense situations you'll have relaxed/ loose areas in your body to compensate for the tensity you're putting elsewhere, that's how muscles work, areas expand and contract to tense key areas. If you can get a sense of ""tight yet loose"" in your art you'll go a long way to having characters feel more grounded.  
I've mentioned some of the slight proportion issues, but while typing I realized my next point really depends what you're going for:  


Lara has zero body fat in this picture which is fine really, some people like to draw characters like that. But if we're going for likeness, she'd be better off having some body fat, especially around the thigh area. I'd speculate these issues would be caused by using a poseable figurine, especially the rigidness in the pose.  


Though this is a stellar drawing and kudos to the artist :)"

PTSD is a separate issue and definitely deserves to be written well when its present. 
I've presented reasoning as to why SA is different and you've disregarded it as emotional reasoning with no cause. 
Two things:

1. This idea that emotions are bad is a bizarre trend in our society. We have emotions and emotional thinking for a reason, trying to discredit that as lesser than rational thinking is wrong. Rational and emotional thinking are equal, nor does being rational make you more ""objective"".

2. I provided reasoning for why certain acts of violence can be justified from an ethical or character based reasoning standpoint; whereas abuse, SA and any ""intimate"" crime are not the same. Once again, context matters.

And no, I'm sorry PoV characters almost never talk about/ react to their assault, its mostly brushed off or the character unhealthily ignores it, perpetuating a bad idea for dealing with trauma in reality."

Edit: I don't think I've stated how inspired I am by Martin's writing, I'm busy with my own book and I can only dream of handling certain things the way he's done it. This does not mean I can't identify flaws in it to help me grow and mature as a writer. I'm not shitting on Martin specifically."
books,ev8ocsh,t1_ev8l9sd,1564285835.0,"No, context matters. Sexual assault is different from other forms of violence in that it can't be justified.

Your character can kill someone to defend themselves, or even have the character justify death to further their own goals. This applies to hurting someone too, say for an interrogation?
You'd usually have a motive behind why a character would behave in such a way. Sure, they can be reprehensible, but you can link it to a cause. Even if your bad guy gets a kick out of doing it there's still more to them than pure sadism. 

Most people who aren't sexual assault survivors don't grasp the gravitas of such an act. To have an evil character rape someone, is to make them beyond redeemable in every way. Yet it's always played up so casually as generic ""gritty"" setting, with no focus on the damage done to the victim.

You can write an irredeemable sadistic monster, but show me more than ""they raped someone"", show me the victim's damage, their flashbacks, waking up alone in the dark terrified, getting spooked by every little thing and so on. I want to feel as angry as the protagonist is at what has been done to the victim (or maybe the protagonist is the victim?) I want a tangible rage for this villain, so if justice is served its all the more sweet, and if they get away you'll feel that loss of hope that many victims feel.

Books are powerful in that they can offer a perspective we may never experience, or solace in knowing we're not alone.

So when I see sexual assault so casually thrown around I can't help but feel it's sloppy writing."

You can have women in lead roles doing fantastic feats, even great from a characterisation standpoint, and still write them in a mediocre fashion."
books,ev8ea6o,t1_ev8bgxj,1564277012.0,"It's not the fact it's written about.
It's overdone, poorly handled and used as a mechanic to show who the bad people are. Rather than to provide perspective.

There are many ways to implement a gritty setting without shoe horning in sexual assault.

You're limited if that's the only thing you can think of."
