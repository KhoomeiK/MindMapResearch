bipolar,ff8qtdk,t1_ff82fai,1579692284.0,Wow so glad that was a good experience! This has been the best thing I’ve ever done for myself
bipolar,ff7h6kf,t1_ff7h09q,1579649460.0,I was really amazed by my experience and how positive it was and the connections I made with people in such a short time. Everyone at this hospital tended to get out like in a week or two

bipolar,fealaee,t1_feaidw0,1578950029.0,"And let me be clear, this is my mental health. This is not something where an aid or whomever just comes to sit and make sure he isn’t physically harming me and then go “okay you got your shot we’re done here” 

I have to sit and detail things that I don’t think she needed to hear nor did I want her to. So I held back. 

I didn’t get the care I went in there for. I went in that day because he put me on yet another med that gave me suicidal ideation within a month. I was not stable and he knew that going into that appointment. 

And I did not say I wanted someone else in there, she mad me even MORE anxious. I wanted to discuss with him how we could make me more comfortable and bring me down from my panic attack. 

He didn’t do that. He didn’t even try. He just knows everything and so didn’t care about my opinion."
bipolar,fea9uvf,t1_fea7hku,1578946076.0,"If I have to sign HIPPA paperwork for my husband to sit in with me and also had to do one for my therapist. I’m sure they’ll have me do one for my girlfriend when I take her with me, so I should def need to give consent for what’s her name office manager"
bipolar,fe9r4lv,t1_fe9n3at,1578940764.0,"Well this was my third appointment and each time I end up sweating bullets, can’t sit still, full anxiety attack and I try to breath keep myself calm. But he sees my physical discomfort and goes “why are you angry?” He’s asked me this before and I say “I’m not angry I’m just frustrated and scared. I’ve been sick for a while” like my whole life. And his tone/body language is almost always combative as perceived by me because I’m conditioned to be afraid after literal years of abuse in my past relationships and with my dad. My husband did go with me once but he doesn’t understand either, he’s never been through anything like that.
So this time he said “why are you angry?!” And I said “I’m not angry, you trigger me and I’m scared” and I EXPECTED him to stop the conversation and take a breath with me and say “okay I’m sorry you feel that way, if I asked my female assistant to sit in, would that help?” OR stopping the appointment and collaborating with my counselor (who he is in contact with) to be like “okay how best do we approach this?” At MINIMUM he should have asked me if I wanted her in the room."
bipolar,fe9lwb9,t1_fe9kwvn,1578939289.0,Thank you 🙏🏻 it’s like I’m in yet another abusive relationship
bipolar,fe9e6jr,t1_fe9c8ax,1578936757.0,Thank you! Yeah at this point I’m starting to look for someone else. This felt gross and I already feel so vulnerable when I’m in there EVEN when my husband goes with me and not only that but I don’t believe he’s listening to me. My therapist just keeps telling me “he’s the best” but I don’t feel it

Fibromyalgia,f68dhro,t3_dqjd2v,1572727740.0,"I have a binder with sheet protectors that hold all my official medical records because my previous doctors NEVER send the damn paperwork. And I always take a list with me and literally cross items off as we go. Doctors are either impressed or turned off, so it’s easy for me to tell if I should continue the conversation or if I’m wasting my breath.

Edit: I recently started a new PCP as I moved and my binder was critical in her determining that I might not actually have Fibro but instead may be experiencing very serious side effects of medication mismanagement."
