PennStateUniversity,fqi2gzj,t3_githtv,1589388679.0,"I lived in North freshman year. I really liked the dorms and the area, but it was so hard to meet people. No one ever came out of their rooms, and interaction with others rarely occurred. That being said, if you want a lot of privacy and a quiet place North is the way to go"

PennStateUniversity,fqgiarf,t3_giaqqj,1589347004.0,"Lived in supplemental freshman year. Constantly felt super lonely and depressed and opened up to my roommate who I thought was my friend. Turns out she was manipulative and such a bad friend. Plus she was super messy and a slob and didn’t even care. She knew I had anxiety about cleaning and used it against me. One time she called me at 2am expected me to help her with her homework, but I was too tired and apparently “I was being a bad friend” I honestly don’t understand how some people are so arrogant and inconsiderate."

I’m sad to say that I have to retake physics and lab after getting a final grade of 69, when I need a C or higher :( this extremely sucks because now I’m contemplating changing my major:("
college,fpuk98f,t3_gfiocd,1588915119.0,"Same here. My mom constantly thinks that I have nothing better to do and make me do an endless list of chores and watch my little sister. I understand that she wants me to help out a little,  but it’s getting so ridiculous. Today I continuously played with and watch my little sister for 5 hours, and when I went to go up to study for my exams, she goes “Where are you going?” “Why don’t you help me more” This is all extremely frustrating, especially because I don’t even have a quiet place to study because everyone is yelling in my household. On top of that I don’t even have desk or a chair so I sit crouched on my bed and my neck and back hurt so much everyday."

I literally had to spend the entire day by myself and it was so depressing. I even got dressed up but then changed cause what was the point? I wasn’t going to celebrate with anyone and I don’t even like celebrating my birthday that much cause it’s just a reminder that it’s another year of my depressing life.
