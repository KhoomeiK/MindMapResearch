AskReddit,fqggfl3,t1_fqgerei,1589345620.0,"Here's my two cents, if you want it.

1. Don't assume you will fail the exam before you even see it. Three weeks of studying is better than no studying, so get on it.

2. It seems to me that she doesn't want to be with you. Sending an apology letter through a friend probably made things worse; it sucks but she doesn't want to talk to you. There will be others though, don't worry.

Everything you mentioned is a common problem for people at every stage of life. That doesn't mean your problems aren't valid, just that you're not alone with them. You're not the first person to mess up with a crush or feel nervous about an exam/performance review/etc. This also means that you will likely have similar problems again and again, but each time you will be stronger.

A piece of advice that I like is to think about how these problems will affect your life after 10 days, 10 months, and 10 years. Take getting a less than ideal score on your AP test for example: 

 * In 10 months, you would take or have already taken college credits that the test would have covered. Since you spent so much time studying for the AP test on the same subject, these credits will be easier for you and you will be able to develop an even stronger understanding of the materia (this was true for me in college physics after I failed both AP Physics exams).

 * In 10 years, you might still be paying down your student loans for the extra college credits you had to take because you failed the AP exams. But if you graduate from college in a good field, you'll probably have no trouble paying for this if you're even still paying your student loans by then.

Thinking about things from this perspective usually makes me feel better about the mistakes I've made and things I'm dealing with.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, don't beat yourself up over what you've done wrong in life. There will always be ups and downs and you will always be making mistakes that seem like major screwups (some of them probably will be). But maintaining a positive attitude will help you to get through the lows so you can enjoy the highs.

I wish you all the best, and good luck with your exams!"
