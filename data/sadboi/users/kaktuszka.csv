vaxxhappened,ethkwg0,t3_cbo1tq,1562818560.0,"I'm not an anti-vaxxer myself, I do think vaccines are essentials, but a lot of people forget what autism is. It's not that ""hey I'm autistic myself, but I literally have no problem than social interacting"". Like. No. Stop. Autism is a spectrum, and there are far less Asperger or mildy autistic people out there, than it appears. Autism CAN BE and MOSTLY IS a horrible syndrome that can be as though as a disability caused by antivaccination. 
I'm not saying, that vaccine is bad, what I say is that autism is not just a mild disability.

Source: I have a autist brother, who can't speak and needs 0-24 monitoring. Also I have seen other autist like him in a special school."

I have never eaten in restaurants of Budapest, because it's overpriced imo, but I was kinda shocked that there are some places where you need to tip them."

tumblr,er16ray,t1_er0h455,1560427667.0,Thank you! I don't get what's so funny about the situation. An adult asked a kid to hurt the other in exchange of showing private parts. Abuse doesn't have a gender.
