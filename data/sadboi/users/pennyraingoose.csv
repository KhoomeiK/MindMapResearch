Some of the commercial features in our environment weren't fully set up for use (like expense pools for pass through calculations), but I imagine they'd be useful if you put the time in on the front end. Yardi's stock reporting is pretty good.  

My favorite software has been the Sage suite of real estate products, but that was about 10 years ago and it was not cloud based at that time. The database structure provided for more flexibility in setting up multi-suite agreements than Yardi, and the security settings and raw data reporting let anyone with read-only access get to the information they needed without a lot of setup."

TrollXOver30,fhagi11,t1_fh9kar8,1581409425.0,"Oh honey, it's gonna be ok. A few things -

Where to begin? As others have said, cast your net far and wide for a job and see what sticks. Finding a job is a job in itself, so give yourself a (manageable) quota of X resumes sent or postings applies for per day. Last time I was looking for work I found a bit of inspiration in thinking on what companies I'd like to work for and checking the career pages on their websites. That bit of thinking outside of the LinkedIn/Career Builder/job website box helped get me excited about finding a job and slog through the other applications. Recruiters, temp-to-hire agencies, or your school's alumni office may be useful tools too.  

I wouldn't advise on completely settling for a position, but it's totally ok to find something that works RIGHT NOW even if it's not your dream job right out of the gate. If it pays the bills and furthers the skills needed for your overall goals, it's good.  

I'd wager we're all a bit 'bad at life' when you look at us from the outside. What's important is that you're working and living towards YOUR life. It's ok if your life ends up a bit different than others' or if your work trajectory takes a detour while you figure out what you want. Break up ""what makes me happy"" into bite sized chunks and chase those. Baby steps now can add up to big things later.  

For loans and retirement I have found comfort and help in having an independent advisor with a mutual organization. They do life insurance and retirement planning, with fees for their services built into their products. Be sure to ask about retirement when looking for work (even if it's a right now kind of job). There are employers that will match your contributions (free money as my dad would say!). A credit union in your area may also have some seminars on personal finance to help you plan for the future.  

Hoping for your best."
