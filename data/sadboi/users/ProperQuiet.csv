If the skulltula room then once you have the boomerang, blow out all the torches to make the stairs collapse and use the nearby bomblings to blow up the wall that was blocked by the stairs and a chest should be there. 


As for the Goron mines I believe I was able to get to every chest but I don’t even remember exactly what I did and again don’t know if things changed in the remake or maybe I’m just mistaken.

Also, Torrid has begun selling “functional” boots but idk about durability.

And Bearpaw does sell a vegan (faux fur) version of some of their boots. I have a wide foot and do prefer the wide boots but vegan boots don’t come in wide. I have a pair of their regular sized boots that fit just fine after going up a size though! Just remember that although that style boot is great for cold, they aren’t really meant to trudge through the snow

Edit: All the boots I previously mentioned don’t have a tall calf and I remembered your issue with lots of snow (I generally wear a long coat so not as big a deal) I thought I’d recommend Jileon rain boots. They’re tall and water proof and especially made for wide feet, calves, and ankles. The biggest calf goes up to 23 inches I believe! And I adore mine.

Your roommates are assholes because they continued to use your special stuff. You are an asshole because you didn’t just move your special stuff, you took everything knowing nobody else has these basic essentials (because you initially agreed to bring them for communal use; it’d be different if everyone agreed to bring their own set)

Here’s the thing, there are certain rules to sharing space with other people. One of those is don’t clog up communal areas with your special sentimental stuff. From all my time being with roommates in college these are usually the rules of the kitchen:

1)Keep your important stuff in your room

2) Get permission to use someone else’s major appliances (coffee maker, blender, etc)

3) Taking food is off limits unless otherwise stated

4) Just about anything else regularly stored in a communal area is fair game (dishes, utensils, pots/pans)

These are all rules that usually don’t even have to be spoken, it’s common courtesy. Notice dishes fall into ‘normal stuff regularly stored in a communal area’; If these dishes are only for you then keep them in your room instead of taking up communal space with them. 

There’s a bit of this story we aren’t getting. What were your roommates’ reactions to being told not to use it? Did they ask you to remove it from the kitchen or distinguish it in some way?

>if you meant, with a T-shirt on and no bra... I don’t see how it would be a problem 

Again, this makes it clear that you may not be understanding/considering  the difference in how men and women would view this situation. The ROOMMATE would be the one uncomfortable with some dude staring at her nipples, did you not consider that? Also if this girl with the bf became uncomfortable with her roommate being bra-less it’s more likely she’d ask the roommate to restrict their clothing choices vs telling her bf not to come over because she’s already made it clear she isn’t willing to compromise her bf’s visits.

I know the feeling because even though I know I’m not attractive, it feels awkward to walk around the house. I’m not allowed to be comfortable the same way I’d be if it were an all female house (which is what me and my other roommate were expecting when we requested a female only apartment). After a long day I want to take my bra off and put on some shorts/PJs yet it has made me extremely uncomfortable when I walk out in the middle of the night to get some water or something and this guy is in the kitchen doing whatever.

I know that based on my past I am extremely intimidated by men, especially those I do not know; sure it’s something I need to work through but in the mean time I should be able to be comfortable too. 

Idk. I’m viewing this from the roommate’s point of view because I currently am the roommate living with one person that won’t compromise. And just offering up how it might be affecting the roommate it ways you may not have considered.

Idk if that’s the case with culture playing a role in whether or not certain things are included in a funeral, but either way, it seems so weird and inappropriate to me. 

NTA op."
PlusSize,eyps74g,t3_cy3iwq,1567309497.0,"My solution is that I bought a matching set of pants and a blazer at Torrid so then I can wear almost any top underneath since it’s so difficult for me to find flattering professional blouses. I’m a Torrid 4x but sometimes go up to a 5 just to have room for my boobs lol. It’s a struggle but I’m sure you’ll find something girl. 

Maybe even try some of the Full Beauty brands like Roaman’s or Jessica London. Good luck out there!"
college,eymrvje,t3_cxk8o2,1567218039.0,"I eventually got rid of my unease on campus during my second semester there and by my second year it felt almost like home. Don’t get me wrong, there are tons of strangers but seeing others in school spirit gear and having learned my way around and the “rules” of the campus finally put my nerves at ease. 

I now knew where I was going, what I was doing, and if I need help people are generally friendly enough. It was a matter of me getting used to my surroundings. 

I still get nervous when I’m alone in the middle of the night but that’s just about anywhere. Sorry I don’t have much advice on the subject but I wish you luck."
AmItheAsshole,eymfp38,t3_cxl0j7,1567207778.0,"NTA: There’s a sign and you even mention it on the way out. I did the same thing when I had an early morning class where all the bathrooms would be full; one day I exited the building through the basement and discovered two separate unisex bathrooms. No lines, no stalls or other people present, I could poop in peace and it was so much nicer than the ones upstairs.

I’ve also done something similar in line at Walmart and there’s tons of people at self check out or express yet all the regular open lines are totally empty, signs lit up and everything, you can bet I checked out first then let others know. 

It’s first come, first served; that’s their fault they weren’t paying attention."
PCOS,eyja8t8,t1_eyj6cu5,1567115195.0,"Think of it this way: going in now will be a lot better than waiting another year and having to explain that. Don’t worry, they won’t, or a good doctor shouldn’t be upset with you. If they do ask that then it’s usually out of concern because missing for an entire year means something serious is going on that needs to be taken care of ASAP."
PCOS,eyj9olv,t3_cx6kn6,1567114835.0,"Knowing when your last period was is important because they need to know if you’re possibly pregnant (can affect medication prescribed or if they need to do blood work) or having any reproduction system issues. 

This question is no doubt easy for women with *regular* periods to remember. They can easily say something like: I’m usually due around the 20th every month and last for 5 days. Even a simple answer like: oh I don’t remember the date but it was 2 weeks ago or  like me, my last period was in April, is usually enough for them.

3 yrs is a significant time span and they don’t expect you to know that long ago but for women with a regular cycle it isn’t a big deal to remember, or easily calculate when their period was because by now they’ve likely settled into a predictable cycle."

1) they’re two dudes. most universities ik of don’t match males & females together in a single room

2) he saw OP change because they share a dorm together and likely share a communal bathroom too.

3) filing one complaint won’t ruin this guy’s life, it’s also not OPs responsibility to worry about this dude’s life; he has to worry about his safety as top priority. it’s not like they’ll kick him out of school if OP is like “Hey, I’m uncomfortable living with my current roommate. He follows me everywhere and constantly calls/texts me. Please let me switch rooms” at most the school might send them to counseling or mediation before just going for expulsion.

I understand being socially awkward or missing some cues but this roommate sounds like he has absolutely no boundaries and is bordering on being a stalker. Even if OP confronts him and lets him know the behavior is unacceptable; it’s still probably best for both of them if they move to different rooms/floors/halls"

From my experience with newborns, they tend to vomit and blow out their diapers a lot. I can’t tell you how many times my niece and nephew threw up, pooped, or peed on me. 

Everyone knows babies are messy; common sense would be to wear something you don’t mind getting dirty or ask for a towel or bib. Now I always ask when I hold a young baby “Hey, do you have a little towel, blanket, or bib I could cover myself with? I just don’t want to get throw up on my clothes” and it’s usually all good. Most people I know with a kid keep cheap towels/blankets around for this purpose so that’s what she should have done."

You should talk to your doctor about your options. Mine put me on spironolactone because I had male pattern hair growth but since being on it I haven’t had *one* pimple at all these past few months. If that doesn’t work you may have to see a good dermatologist.

Keep taking care of your skin, I like Aveeno clear complexion lotions and cleansers, and keep fighting, you can do this!"

Anyway, I worked as a kennel assistant one summer. One day we had a shiba-inu come in to stay the weekend. I heard these guys are escape artists but didn’t really take it seriously...
We had outdoor runs we’d take the dogs to go potty and stretch their legs while we clean cages. One day I take this little cutie out to do his business; I put him in one of the runs, latched it, and gave it a nice tug for good measure. I cleaned his cage and come back a few minutes later and he greets me at the damn door. Tail wagging, and huge grin. I go over to his cage and somehow the door is *still* latched shut. I was beyond confused.

When I told my co-workers they told me I probably just didn’t latch it and to make sure I give some of the older runs a good tug when I close it. And I’m like...but that’s what I did!!!?!?

This also happened with his inside cage and I could understand a dog breaking out of one of those but not the outdoor ones"
