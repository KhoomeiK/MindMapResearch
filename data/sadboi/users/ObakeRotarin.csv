As far as the friend thing goes though, I'm in the exact same boat but ive been aware for a few years that they werent really real but I'm finally about to be able to move and start the next part of my life and be able to make real friends, you know?

I just don't want to assume that she orgasmed when maybe it could've just been a moment that felt really good that she didnt finish on, you know? I also think that the stigma that I've Been exposed to my whole life where it's basically impossible for women to orgasm has played a huge part bc women always orgasm way more than youd expect them to so you question even the seemingly most obvious ones bc of how rare youve been lead to believe female orgasms are lol. But I do see how that could be pretty frustrating though, ive just never thought about it that way. I'll try to be a bit more conscious about it anyway, bc I assure you, I can absolutely tell lmfao, but I also know that I can be oblivious and don't really want to make an ass out of myself and also want to make sure she is having a good time haha."

But eventually i came to the realization that I'm not getting anywhere by doing that and that I'll be doomed to have that be my every day for the rest of my life unless i did something to make a change. I feel like for a lot of people if they have this realization they might strive to be like someone they've seen who they were jealous of but for me I realized that they were them and I was me and there was no chance of me actually becoming that person, and even if I could, why would i want to? It would be an even sadder existence to just be the second version of someone else regardless of how attractive, talented, funny, smart, popular, or successful they are. So I just started trying to come up with a customized version of myself in my head that would make the people I was jealous of become jealous of me and once I had that direction I took all of my energy away from putting myself down and redirected it to building myself up and ive still got a long way to go but its incredible how quickly you start to actually feel optimism about what your future will be like and I would just reccomend anyway feeling this way to give that a shot and work with what you have and be the best damn version of you you can be bc things have been so much better for me since starting towards this goal."

Advice,ff328az,t1_ff2s3g2,1579531761.0,"I know exactly how you feel I'm trying to do that exact same thing but if you want to move though and you dont already have any savings, unless youre in a position where you can save 100% of your check and currently have no living expenses and can also work at least 30 hours a week, 6 months at your first job probably wont give you as much money as you would need. I would consider either saving for longer or checking out some opportunities at a community college near you if you have one, bc for me I got my emt b certification and I only had to take one class to get it and we only met 2 mornings a week for about 2 hours a session and it was only 1 semester long and now ive got an emt job making $14 an hour. Just something to consider, but if that type of thing doesnt work for you, then I would definitely reccomend putting more time into saving. I know that it sucks, its been almost 3 years for me since i graduated high school and im finally about to move and I'm so fucking stoked lol its taken forever but I'm finally in 5he home stretch haha. Whatever you end up doing though I hope it works out for the best."
Advice,ff314g3,t3_erc563,1579530885.0,What the hell stores are you applying at that require prior experience lmfao thats ridiculous but honestly youre doing everything you can the only advice I can think of is apply at hotels as well bc that will add an entire new category of potential employers and if all else fails im pretty positive wendys does open interviews so you can just walk in and get one right away and I wouldnt imagine youd have any issue getting hired and as long as you can do that just try your best to make a good impression on the manager and you'll have an experience to put down for future jobs which should increase your odds tenfold. Other than that all I can think of is do as many in person applications as you can and try to show up around 8-11am bc they'll actually have a face to put to your name and you took the initiative to come in and at that time you have a good chance of encountering the HR Coordinator or manager or whoever handles hiring and you'll also appear responsible right off the bat if you show up early like that and it just puts you way above and beyond the people who apply online at most places in my experience anyway. Also bring a pen ive known people to be very judgemental about candidates not bringing their own pen to apply lol. Best of luck to you.

It can be irritating enough when your bf/gf isnt receptive to your feelings or needs or just lacks vulnerability and doesnt show enough care and attentiveness for you on a general basis, but actively avoiding you when it is made blatantly clear that you could seriously use support at that exact moment? Forget it, I dont know if theres any coming back from that, you know? That's just all the time and energy he's willing to put into you and this relationship as a whole on full display right there if you ask me.

Advice,fede05k,t1_fedd7ic,1579008881.0,I took it more as its just driving him crazy than actually causing him immense pain and depending on the actual dynamics of their friendship and the situations theyre both in I think it would definitely be reasonable for her to feel abandoned if she has to face certain adversities without a best friend to help her through them even though she does have a best friend who can do just that but hes just not talking to her you see what I'm saying. Like yeah he has a right to do what he needs to to be mentally healthy of course but its just its possible she might suffer from that too and I think thats important to consider.

Advice,feaunjj,t1_fe9t1a4,1578952324.0,"I literally feel the exact same way my mom would take literally any excuse to start screaming and tearing into me for hours and im an only child so i never had any siblings to get pissed at me but if it got really bad though my dad would get super pissed off at me for making my mom so upset just by existing and he would tackle and strangle me and they were both body builders so he was pretty damn good at it and my mom would say the same shit about feeding me but she hardly did that lol most of the time i made my own food from the age of 7 and thats good that you have a college you can stay at now as a safe haven but that sucks so much that she takes it out on you for taking refuge there and im so sorry that happens to you but i completely relate 100% ive been suicidal for most of my life but somehow ive convinced myself the whole time to keep pushing to the other side of this shit and im really happy that youve been able to make it this far too and im really proud of you for that. But yeah i havent really experienced any abuse in years so things are better in that respect but i just have a lot of emotional scarring and i have incredibly varying levels of depression and im pretty sure i have depersonalization disorder as well but if not at the very least im super cut off from my emotions and i feel numb much of the time so its still hard sometimes but i push through every day and i believe that one day ill be fully healed. Also i know this is probably very confusing considering what ive said but i still live with my dad and things are perfectly fine despite what has happened in the past bc deep down he's a good guy and i know he really does care its just he's a bit too hot headed for his own good sometimes and he wasnt really cut out to be a dad, at least not with my mom as his wife anyway bc she drove him insane and he took it out on me bc back then he viewed me as the cause but since then he has realized that it was her who was the issue and he deeply regrets many of the things he has done. Thank you for your concern btw it really means a lot to me seriously. As for you second question, im sure therapy would probably do me a lot of good, but i have not tried it yet because i just can not be happy living my life working in the regular workforce, and i want to go to college but im just not ready for it yet (there are a few reasons why im not ready but a big one is that everyone in college seems so happy and lively and i think id just feel out of place and isolated), so that leaves the military bc that way i wont have to worry about debt in college bc theyll pay for it for me, and ill have savings from serving as well, and ill actually be a part of a real family for the first time bc theres tons of camaraderie in the military, it will give me much more purpose and self worth, and ill be able to travel all over and make various friends and i think all of those things are crucial to improving my mental health and the military does not like accepting recruits who have been / are in therapy or have mental illnesses so it is exponentially harder to be accepted if you do any of those things so because of that ive held off on therapy but i might be open to it one day a few years from now if i still think id benefit from it. But yeah thats basically where im at right now sorry this response is so long i wasnt planning on writing so much but i just kinda kept going ig lol. What about you? How are you doing? And do you have any experience with therapy?"

If youre still going through this you have my deepest sympathies sincerely i know how much this hurts and if you havent yet you need to confront her about how she makes you feel bc for me i confronted her many many times and she would just try to throw the fault at me saying that i was a pussy for being so affected by certain things and that i made other things up and she tried to put ME in therapy because she thought that I was the one who was fucked up and honestly ive been at the point for a very long time to where if she died i think i actually might feel joy; but from the tone of your message it sounds like there still might be hope for you and your mom and i dont mean to downplay the severity of the adversities you face dont get me wrong but for some reason the way you describe it leads me to believe that you might still be able to salvage your relationship if thats something youd want but the only way to do that is to tell her exactly how you feel holding nothing back and make sure you do everything you can to make sure she knows you are being dead serious bc my mom never took me seriously and now the bitch is all the fuck alone lol but seriously though if thats something you want i believe in you with every fibre of my being to pull it off and i know you have the strength to bc fuck you have to be strong to make it this far in a life like that and i wish you the best of luck"

Vent,fde1nqe,t1_fdd2csu,1578329164.0,"Thank you for your concern i really appreciate it. But yeah im fine now more or less i guess my parents finally got divorced when i was about 14 or 15 (im 20 now) and when that happened i just lived with my dad and never saw my mom. Despite what this comment might make you think, he's actually a really good guy, he's just too hot headed for his own good sometimes and i dont really think he was particularly cut out to be a dad, at least not with my mom as his wife anyway. But yeah, pretty much from the day my mom left, him and i got along pretty perfectly, and honestly im not entirely sure i can blame him for acting the way he did after being trapped in that hell with my mom every day for so many years; also its different with my dad bc he might have done some fucked up shit sometimes but i always knew that deep down he cared, with my mom there was no such thing inside of her lol. But things are much better now, i just have a ton of emotional scarring, i have wildly varying levels of depression at all times, pretty possitive ive got depersonalization disorder as well but if not im at least just almost entirely cut off from my emotions leaving me feeling pretty numb most of the time, never had any siblings and spent most of my time in my house so i never really did all that much socializing growing up and im sure that it shows, dont really have any friends (probably because of that last one), and it feels incredibly embarrassing to say for some reason, but i find that in a lot of different settings, i just literally do not know how to have fun bc i never really concerned myself with having fun bc even hiding in my room couldnt keep me safe you know? The last thing i wanted to do was anything that would actively draw attention to myself, which i feel like most things people do for fun do, so it just leaves me awkwardly in a group of people sometimes all doing something and i feel super pressured to try to fit in with them and like i just dont know whats happening and its so stressful.

relationships,fd5mipq,t3_ek1j2u,1578179079.0,Lol thats so fucking petty of her to do that i think you dodged a bullet man who knows what other shit shes randomly offset by. I also cry during movies pretty frequently as a dude and honestly i have yet to meet a girl who didnt think that was an endearing quality in a man so i have no doubt youll be fine just not with her but that blows though that your date was a bust still you have my deepest condolences it happens to the best of us lmfao
AskRedditAfterDark,fd4xgw3,t1_fd4l6gl,1578172038.0,She just took the things op was saying as offensive to his wife and was standing up for her lmfao. Who is being shit on by that?
depression,fd47u0r,t3_ejsoej,1578165167.0,"Fr lol its all ""what the fuck is wrong with that kid he's weird as fuck"" and then ""damn how did none of us know"" its unreal how this actually happens"
AskRedditAfterDark,fd2ggvx,t1_fd2f6ue,1578146868.0,Yeah i mean thats incredible but the woman youve dubbed as a cunt clearly hasnt had the level of support your wife had from you and seems to still be having at least somewhat of a harder time with everything as a result and if theres no one in her regular life to support her in such a way then she at the very least deserves whatever support she can find on the internet instead of being massively shit on by everyone
AskRedditAfterDark,fd2cn0c,t1_fd2a6wy,1578145289.0,Lmfao im sorry is it a crime for /u/cheezyTHC to be sensitive and take offense to hearing someone describe a body similar to hers in great detail when she is clearly still very insecure about it and has only had experience of the people around her viewing it as a bad thing as well? Seems hard to justify her being the cunt in this scenario does it not lol
AskRedditAfterDark,fd0nduz,t1_fd0id0q,1578121212.0,"I have no idea why you got so many downvotes lol you clearly werent saying ew in reference to his wifes scars but apparently everyone thought you were. Also he never said anything possitive or negative about those details of her so i mean maybe he was ""dissecting"" her as you suggested but when i was reading it i was just imagining him lovingly recollecting all of the details of his wifes body and appreciating it for being hers. Whatever the case though sorry for the negative response you got from this but know that at least i understand your intent for whatever its worth lmao."
