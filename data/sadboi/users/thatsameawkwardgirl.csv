MetroPCS,fowsuxr,t3_g9trhh,1588126417.0,"Mine is terribly slow as well, despite not exceeding the 35gb unlimited data cap. Where do you live? I think the main issue is that their towers are extremely congested due to everything going on. Most people are trapped at home, and then I know many students have received iPads that use cellular data for homeschooling so that increases the tower congestion by thousands. So there's lots of traffic happening which is slowing everything down. And then there is the 5G towers that are being installed which interferes with the 4G tower connection. So those can be an issue if you haven't exceeded you cap (if you have the unlimited data package) To see if it's a congested tower issue, try staying up late one morning. Maybe 2am or 3am ish and see if your speeds change. I noticed for me the speeds increase drastically when most people are asleep and not using their mobile data."

Subliminal,fj3yh3m,t3_fbeq4x,1582996103.0,"You have to detach from that. And you have to most importantly trust that it's working otherwise it will not. If you're filling your subconscious with ""but what if it doesn't work"" ""is this working"" ""I don't think it's working"" ""ugh I'm not getting results"" all the time then it's going to not only be overwhelmed but question in doubt when you command it to do what you want.

Also, the time for the results may vary between person. So one committed and faithful person may see results in 4 months another may see one in 1 month and it just depends... One month may not be enough for you, and/or perhaps you don't believe the change is happening."

You have to learn to face this doubt and be more confident in the change and trust your intuition because the change is happening as long as you allow the belief in the process through.

So your lack of faith is causing you to look at everyone else with results which further diminishes your faith and it's a cycle you have to get out of."

My advice to you is to expect to get that BFF who's just like you. Just know that any day now that person is going to come into your life... But don't overwhelm yourself in the thought. Just believe and expect.

And perhaps this could be online or in real life. So look out both ways! And allow yourself to be seen. And also don't sleep on online relationships or limit yourself to one person in your town or even your country. I've seen plenty of people meet in real life. And honestly those are really powerful and interesting relationships. 

Good luck to you! ^^"
Subliminal,fj3lz9l,t1_fj2tf6y,1582987501.0,"Lol aww nah that's not weird. I actually told her that a few months ago and she said that she also manifested me, but she didn't think it was possible to manifest someone, let alone a mirror of herself. I felt the same way. And she said that she's very grateful to have me in her life and she brings up how crazy it is that we met and are like replicas of eachother and she expresses her gratitude all the time, and so do I. 

When she first told me she tried to manifest meI was so shocked and I was also like extremely happy and joyous. And I felt flattered to have someone searching for me... It also was odd. Like to have met her... But not anything bad. It was wonderful, but seriously we are too alike. It's so uncanny and still even though I am faithful to Law of Attraction I still believe she is a miracle. And ironically she told me I was before I had the chance to say it to her."

Subliminal,fj1q86d,t1_fj1i728,1582925389.0,"Well I'm spiritual so the whole idea of the belief is like revolved around energy, vibration and attraction. If you elevate your vibration with things and thoughts that make you feel good, the universe, God, source, or whatever word you identify with, recognizes it and helps you to manifest it. Sometimes it can take a while for things and sometimes it's quick. But if you've heard of the butterfly effect, you know that things will fall into place so that you meet that person.

Now with me and this other person, we actually met online and I don't have a problem with meeting people and conversing. The thing is, I live in a neighborhood that's very low vibe and negative and none of these people align with me if that makes sense. So I just look online. And I've had many online ""friends"" in my time, and in my opinion this person has been the only true friend and... More...

How it happened was I used to be apart of this subliminal community which is very toxic, so I left and I was going to delete the app, but I realized that place (despite its issues) made me feel at least a little less lonely but the negativity was too much. So I said hey why not use this app for something else instead of deleting the thing. And I went to a friend's community and like most of the people on there were teens younger than myself and like I wanted to conversaye with someone around my age. And once again I had the thought of deleting the app until I saw this one profile, and the person was a bit older than me. She was the only one in my age criteria and she also had so many similar hobbies and likes as me. So I said we'll that's odd how she's just like there with the spotlight on her. So then I messaged her. But it didn't end here. This is how I know we were meant to meet for sure and that it was some divine plan.

There used to be this dude I talked to... And we talked all night all the time and like when I first met the girl I didn't talk to her much at all because I wanted to talk to him and like I feel so bad looking back and that was a huge mistake. But anyway, the guy randomly like started ignoring me. Like out of the blue and I'm like... What the heck? Even I'd try to message him and he just wouldn't reply... So this prompted me to put more time into the other girl... And that's when we like hit it off and I learned so much more about her... She's practically me and I'm her. 

But yeah that's how it went. It's like a butterfly of events. I joined that community... All the negativity caused me to leave... Me leaving prompted me to look for a potential friend. She was the only one around my age and we were very similar based on the bio, the guy who I put all my time into randomly stopped talking and that's a good thing because she potentially could've got bored of me not talking much and just left...and I would've missed out on the most amazing thing.

Sorry for the book, you probably could publish this thing lol.

If there's anything else you wanna ask or if you need me to clarify... Just lemme know."
Subliminal,fj14clr,t3_fagwy3,1582912784.0,"Well, based on my oberservations, the more expressive part of the community is composed of teens and children. Not to say that all teens in children are responsible. It's just that typically online drama is the thing these days for them and that's all that fulfills them. They are attention seekers, many of them anyway. So the reason they're childish and contributing to these low-vibe activities is simply because they're child-ish. Lol"
Subliminal,fj13om7,t3_fawrt9,1582912449.0,"Yes I did! I used a manifest a best friend subliminal like in the beginning of october of 2019 and like I wanted a best friend who is exactly like me and 10 days after listening for probably an hour or less each day I met her. And we clicked instantly. It felt like I'd known her for years. And then oddly enough we had both believed we were twin flames... Which all the signs pointed to yes and they still do which is odd. But we're not on the best terms right now and haven't talked in a little while and I don't know what the heck is going on between us lol.

So there ya go. If you have any extra questions feel free to ask."

Another idea from another user was using your thumb and placing it near the soft palate, and using the back third of your tongue to try to match the position of your thumb to get a better idea of where it should be. That's if you struggle with placement."

I also agree with what you said about everyone attacking Yang just because he's Asian. I feel bad because he has the most potential and would likely go down as one of the best presidents in American history, but people fail to give him a chance. I feel like if he was white proposing these ideas some people would think it's crazy but most would be for it. Maybe even if he was black, there'd just be a little more aggression towards him.

And I don't even know if ""selfishness"" is the right word because UBI doesn't come from anyone's check. It will mainly come from the 10% VAT on businesses. These people, in my opinion, want there to be poverty and economical classes. They want to feel better about themselves. They was to taunt and boast about their wealth and not be seen alongside a former struggling individual. This is what I think. Believe it or not, many people would rather feel superior to others than to actually provide them help to get them to their ""status."""

Positivity,ezwiy2w,t3_d2hpwg,1568217748.0,"Holy shit I needed this.

I was once living with a mentally abusive relative who tried to destroy my life in anyway possible. My family and I decided to move into a shelter and after a whole day of mental and physical suffering trying to get placed, we got placed in a place infested with roaches, a place where they have access to your room at all times, a place where there are tons of strict rules and a curfew and a lack of resources. I was having some suicidal thoughts about everything and how nothing ever works out for me. I believed that my life is the epitome of the ""shit end of the stick""

I was about to close out the app (I don't use it much) and go on with my suffering when I saw this before I closed it out. Thank you for posting this because I can really relate and it feels like someome is on my side and that I can finally get to a good place, that one day I WILL be content and comfortable in my OWN living space. Right now that seems like some far-fetched ancient prophecy, but I do hope it can and most certainly will happen."

YangForPresidentHQ,ezrl4ky,t3_d1y5v0,1568075387.0,"This ridiculous and nerve-racking. I see what they're trying to do. They're trying ever little way they can to make people oblivious to his existence. 

They figure ""Hey, let's purposely screw up his name and call him John, then broadcast the video of him crowdsurfing... I know, I know... featuring him on our channel may be counterproductive but we're getting a lot of backlash and we don't want the eyes on us because we're not acknowledging him. Screw up the name, people search him up, nothing found, oh well and that's it. Perfect strategy amarite? """
YangForPresidentHQ,ezrk4gr,t3_d1vyt0,1568075023.0,Seriously? I don't think this was a mistake. Republicans often get a bad rep so maybe saying that he's a republican will automatically steer people away from him. Or maybe that's far-fetched.
