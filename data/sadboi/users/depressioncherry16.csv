Coronavirus,flmxnij,t1_flmx8k2,1585301016.0,i think they’re right. as long as there are no other people in the house you can come. you drive a car with them everyday anyway so I don’t see how coming to their house would be different. just avoid contact with other people and you’re gonna be fine
Coronavirus,flmxk3d,t3_fpbug6,1585300902.0,"question 
is high blood pressure dangerous only if you’re not taking medication to lower it? or is it dangerous nevertheless? my parents take the medication and im very scared for them (theyre doctors so its easier for them to contract it bc they go to work everyday)"
psychologystudents,fl0tee7,t1_fkz8s2s,1584715331.0,"first of all, thanks for your reply & helping me with this! 

I've thought about it and came to the conclusion that it's probably not a good idea to divide doctors by the type, I think I'll have a lot of them so it might be hard to do and on top of that I feel like they won't differ much. Maybe attitudes of psychiatrists vs other doctors would differ but I won't be able to reach that many psychiatrists in order to have even number of people in the groups. So I decided to make my IV a profession in general.

So I think that my IVs are gonna be a profession (doctor/nurse); work experience in years (0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39 - I think it would be important to keep the work experience as IV bc it might influence how they answered the questions); age & sex (F/M).  and then my DV is attitude and it has two levels - attitudes towards anorexia nervosa and other mental illnesses. Do you think it makes sense? 

So it leaves me with four factors that influence my dependent variable. Isn't it gonna be MANOVA instead of ANOVA then? (I'm just wondering tho, I'm probably wrong haha. or maybe you meant ANOVA like an umbrella term?)

thank you for suggesting that method, I think I might use it! My parents work in a hospital so I think I can ask them to give out a couple of the surveys to their colleagues to fill and pass to their friends working in this field. it sounds like a better idea considering all that is going on right now with Covid-19 etc. I had this idea back in September before there even was a Coronavirus pandemic... well it's not that bad in my country yet so I'll try to do it as quickly as possible before the medical staff is busy and overworked, which is probably gonna happen looking at how it's going in other countries..."
psychologystudents,fkynazx,t1_fkym1zr,1584652160.0,"I have thought about giving both questionnaires to each participant, but wouldn't it kind of suggest the answers? I mean, if you fill the first questionnaire you tend to give the same answers in the second one? I might add that both versions of questionnaires are almost identical, the only difference is that it has 'anorexia nervosa' instead of 'mental illness' in a question. So for example the first question is ""A mentally ill person is more likely to harm others than a normal person"" in the first version and in the second version it's ""A person with anorexia nervosa is more likely to harm others than a normal person"". I feel like the participants would maybe feel like they're doing the same thing twice. I don't know if it's a valid concern though, it's just something that I was worried about"
psychologystudents,fkyiu4e,t1_fkyihkj,1584649594.0,"Thanks again! I have one more question actually. Given that I have two groups (doctors and nurses) and my DV also has two levels, how do I distribute? The same number of doctors should get the anorexia version and the same number of doctors should get the mental illness version, and then the same number of nurses should get the anorexia version and the same number should get the mental illness version? I’m sorry if this is a stupid question, as I said I really suck at Stats haha. And I really want this to be correct methodologically. I hope it’s not confusing, English is not my first language and I’m just trying to make sure that other people understand what I mean, that’s why it may sound kind of weird for native speakers"
psychologystudents,fkyi43z,t1_fkyhpv9,1584649185.0,THANK YOU SO MUCH! this answer is actually very helpful! I was confused as how to do it but what you wrote actually cleared some things up in my head!
psychologystudents,fkxsobe,t1_fkxkw8w,1584634671.0,"shit I did not understand anything from what you wrote haha (it's my fault tho not yours, I think it has to do with language barrier - we don't use the terminology DV or IVS here and I don't know what it means, I learnt Stats in Polish as this is where I'm from and where I study). as I sad in the post, I'm terrible at things like Maths or Stats, but I just need to do this project in order to pass my 3rd year (btw in Poland Psychology degree takes 5 years, it's not divided into BS and MS, so if you apply to Uni to study Psych you need to study for 5 years otherwise you won't get the degree!). So I'm really struggling here as you may imagine!

What I gathered from your answer is: I need to figure out what the dependent variable & independent variables are in this. So I think that my IV is the type of doctor, their sex, age and work experience. And the DV is their attitude towards people with mental disorder? Where do I go from there?

I also thought about not dividing the doctors into groups by specialty, just keep two groups - doctors in general and nurses. I feel like it would be much easier to do, but also less interesting. I just don't think I can manage with so many variables etc not knowing shit about Stats haha

Would you mind telling me how you would do this? I mean like if you had to carry this study out yourself. What are the steps etc. I'm really lost with this. I'll try my best to understand and google the terminology. This is an interesting research indeed, I just wish I understood stats and how exactly to carry this study out etc...

Most importantly I need to know how to distribute the surveys, as I need to start the study very soon, I hope I can figure out how to analyze it in SPSS  later.

thanks for your reply! I really appreciate it"
psychologyresearch,fkx8ewz,t1_fkx6jlo,1584621945.0,"Thanks for your reply! yes I want to see if there is a difference in how each specialty perceives each group. And also how their sex, age and how much years of work experience they have influences how they perceive mentally ill people. Now that I think about it, it starts to make sense that I need equal amounts of people in each group. I think I'd have to do it the way I wrote in my post!

I have thought about giving both to each participants, but wouldn't it kind of suggest the answers? I mean, if you fill the first questionnaire you tend to give the same answers in the second one? I don't know if it's a valid concern though, it's just something that I was worried about"

But if they could actually ‚choose’ a child I’m more than convinced they’d go for someone way smarter than me, both academically and socially. They are always talking about their friends’ children and telling me that I should be more like them. I feel bad that I’m not that person, that I’m not one of those perfect, smart kids, that I have depression and barely leave my house. I feel so guilty for wasting their money on private lessons to help me do better when I was still in high school which did not bring the desired effect. They did their best to teach me everything from a very young age (like English - I started learning when I was a kid), but I know I can’t do better than my brain allows me to, if that makes sense. Life is not very fun when you have overly ambitious parents who put on you so much pressure but you also know you will probably never succeed in what they want you to do."

depression,fbare1d,t1_fbaqdcl,1576685094.0,"same. I feel like I have no right to feel this way because I’m so privilleged and it’s honestly soul crushing. and on top of all that I have unsupportive parents who don’t believe in depression (despite being doctors themselves). they say shit like „you have no reason to be depressed, you feel sad because you never leave your room”. yeah maybe I never leave my room except when I’m going to uni because I absolutely hate my life and have maybe 3 friends who are busy most of the time and have their own lives? I know I’m just complaining and it’s probably my fault I don’t have friends but I honestly can’t be bothered to try. I feel like I don’t connect to anyone. It’s always about the small talk, never the deeper stuff. When I’m at uni I talk to people about school and such but I genuinely don’t enjoy spending time with them and I’d rather be alone in my own world. I have no plan for the future and chose an useless major because I had no idea what I wanted to. I’m just wasting my time basically. My parents wanted me to carry the family tradition and become a doctor but I was just too stupid to get in, so I’m basically a disappointment to them and a financial burden. Thank god the University education is free in my country otherwise it would make me even more depressed to know they’re paying for my shitty major. I’m sorry for this rant lol just wanted to get it off my chest bc I’ve been feeling extra hopeless those past few months"
depression,fbamyhy,t3_ecb4lx,1576682226.0,"I’m with you on this one. I wish I could donate my time on earth to someone who would actually make good use out of it. It sucks that many people who contribute to this world get cancer and die while people like me live despite not wanting to. I’m tired of feeling like a piece of shit all the time. I wish I could either stop feeling this way or be brave enough to actually go through with it. Instead I’m totally useless and stuck here not enjoying life but also hanging in there only because I feel like I could never take my own life. On top of that I feel guilty because there’s nothing wrong with my life. My parents still pay for everything. I’m in university. I just feel like a failure and my major is shitty and it won’t get me anything in life because I’m too stupid to do what I dream about doing. and overall I’m a very anxious person who can’t deal with life situations. I worry about everything and can’t do anything by myself. I live in a shitty country with shitty government and people who hate everyone who isn’t a straight, white person. I’m just a piece of shit tbh, my parents deserve a better child. I would be happy to die by an accident so nobody could blame me and wonder what they could have done.  I understand other people have it worse but I’m just really having a very shitty time here on earth and the thought of being alive for let’s say the next 50 years absolutely terrifies me."

How do you like NMF? I’ve been thinking about picking it up, I’m thinking it could even be a good one to buffer with in case I need to do it a couple of times a week in the beginning if I can’t handle the initial irritation - it doesnt contain sillicones or other occlusives which would allow the tret to penetrate"

pat dry using a paper towel, spray with thermal water 

apply Hada Labo Hyaluronic Acid on wet skin 

apply Clinique Moisture Surge intense

apply LRP spf

My fave moisturizer that I’m using (clinique moisture surge intense) has sillicones in it, so it’s creating an occlusive layer that tret will not fully go through (or that’s what I think at least). I will maybe look for some other moisturizer to use before tret (if you have any recommendations, feel free to let me know xx), but the clinique one works so well that I thought maybe I could use it on top of tret to give it a chance to penetrate.

My skin tolerate tret well with the moisturizer on, so I thought I didn’t have to compromise the efficacy with buffering. Can’t find a way to work around the initial dry feeling tho.."

tretinoin,f7nbh57,t1_f7mocnn,1573893791.0,"yeah I agree, I’m just more drawn to tret because it has been studied so much more than adapalene and we have a strong proof that it works. perhaps sdapalene would have similiar results, but it might me a bit less effective, we just don’t know"
tretinoin,f7mcfc1,t1_f7gq1cf,1573859568.0,do you use the cicaplast everyday? and do you buffer your tret beforehand?
tretinoin,f7maut4,t3_dwoi70,1573858404.0,"I used adapalene before I started tret. speaking from the experience I think it’s gonna be a lot gentler on your skin- I have had literally zero irritation with adapalene, it was like using a plain moistruizer for me, whereas with tret my face is always red and peeling. I’d stick it out solely for the anti aging benefits tho. That’s what I decided to do for myself as well. Tret is the most powerful anti aging ingredient and I want all of the anti aging stuff I can get
if you’re in it for acne or other skin issues, don’t care about the anti aging and are done with the irritation, by all means try adapalene"
tretinoin,f7macr2,t3_dwwafq,1573858037.0,I was wondering about it as well. I know buffering and applying vaseline on top cuts down the irritation but I can’t help thinking that the effects are not gonna be as good as they could have been...
depression,f7l9yh7,t1_f7kxnwf,1573835933.0,"don’t get too caught up in thinking that college years are the best years of your life. for a lot of people it’s not the case at all. being a teenager/ young adult is so fucking hard. it’s actually much harder than being in your 40s or 50s. you don’t know what the fuck is going on, who you even are and what you are supposed to be doing. it gets easier with time. or at least this is what I choose to believe to keep myself somewhat sane."
depression,f7hivan,t1_f7hhub9,1573741543.0,thanks! means a lot. im trying hard to find the courage to go. hopefully it will happen soon. very happy you decided for yourself to go! i wish you all the best!
tretinoin,f7fiu5d,t1_f7f5ozr,1573680325.0,thanks! I’ll try that
tretinoin,f7e50dd,t1_f7cd2iz,1573646752.0,"do you just put aquaphor on top of tret? no, I have not tried that! I just do hyaluronic acid, moistruizer and tret. would you mind sharing your entire routine? x
im a little bit afraid it would clog my pores. aquaphor is so thick I only use it on my lips"
depression,f7e4vij,t1_f7d014h,1573646581.0,be careful about telling them if you don’t trust them. telling my parents about my depression ruined my life even more and made it impossible for me to seek professional help due to feeling guilty. now i have to deal with everything on my own
tretinoin,f7ayk7s,t1_f7axu7h,1573546052.0,"wow really? I have similiar issues and I’m scared to apply it every night.. like my face would fall off lol
I wash my face, apply hialuronic acid serum and moisturizer on wet skin, wait about an hour and apply the tret..."
tretinoin,f7ayb1m,t1_f7arbfe,1573545691.0,your mom is great! I wish I learned those things from my mom long ago

poland,f6pfn89,t3_dshkiv,1573055282.0,"I really think you should finish your degree first.  At the end of the day - this is why you came to our country in the first place, right? Look at the big picture. This is what is going to actually matter in a few years. You only have 2 years left. I know you’re heartbroken and this is the last thing you wanna hear right now, but...There’s plenty of girls in Poland. And guys. Meet some new people, make new friends. Once you get out of that state of sadness in a few weeks/months, life might turn out to be just fine. Feel all the emotions you feel. Deal with it however you want. Whatever can get you through those first (and hardest) weeks. You know, there is nothing holding you back from getting yourself out there more. I know you’re probably rolling your eyes right now thinking „how could I ever hang out with someone who isn’t her?”. It’s gonna pass, I promise. Try to make the most out of your time left in Warsaw, don’t leave just yet. Who knows what is going to happen? Life is unpredictable. If you’re studying at University of Warsaw (WISP), I know it can be quite easy to connect with others - we have a lot of club parties. There is even one happening tomorrow! it’s at ROOM 13 Club. :) if you ever need to talk, reach out! wishing you all the best xx"
findapath,f6ln0ic,t1_f6k89xo,1572953697.0,wow this is an actually good advice!
tretinoin,f6jjfhy,t1_f6jigav,1572895630.0,i think so too. i’ve been on tret for 1.5 months already and did not experience purging xx
SkincareAddiction,f5w9bac,t1_f5w4x7g,1572518003.0,"I wouldn’t rely on Korean/Japanese sunscreens, they don’t disclose the PPD rating (and PA++++ is roughly PPD16, whereas the Shaka Fluid is PPD46!)"
SkincareAddiction,f5s8dih,t1_f5rftvq,1572416329.0,"is Canadian version of LRP Light Fluid any different than European? if so, then I’m only interested in the European one (it’s PPD 42, Shaka is PPD 47, so the difference is not that dramatic)"
SkincareAddiction,f5pygz9,t1_f5pwmzz,1572369864.0,really?😅 do they still sell it in your country?! where are you based?
tretinoin,f5n9296,t3_dodulj,1572297865.0,if your skin can handle both actives at once then I don’t see why not

tretinoin,f5edudv,t1_f59svja,1572169028.0,how long does the retinization phase last?
SkincareAddiction,f5adwjh,t1_f5a68f7,1572105622.0,you need to disclose the sponsorship tho? if she hasnt’t said „this video is sponsored by Maybelline” then it’s probably not? I might be naive tho lol
