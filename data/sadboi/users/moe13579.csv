antiMLM,f6n9jm6,t3_dp6it0,1572987101.0,"My mom is involved in an MLM called Isagenix , I‚Äôm worried it classifies as a pyramid scheme.
My mother joined 2 years ago to loose weight and detoxify, then she got sucked into the community of distributors that got her invested in buying products and recruiting people. She claimed to have made some money, that barely covered her costs, so all that work on top of being a mother of five was for nothing. Although my mother was happy, she was also stressed and couldn‚Äôt balance her time as a mother and a distributor. I can‚Äôt blame her for joining regardless, before she had no social life and now she can feel like an Entrepreneur even if she is far from that. I like that she is happy, but is it worth it? Also if Isagenix is a pyramid scheme I doubt it‚Äôs as serious as Herbal Life. But I only know my mothers story so I would like some help finding out if there is anything shady going on."
