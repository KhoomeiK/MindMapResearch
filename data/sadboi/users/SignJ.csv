depression,epdorb6,t1_epdiswn,1559170623.0,"Thank you very much for the support jlion23 I will continue to do so. I'm taking it day by day. Although, my eating habbits are a bit off I've been through anorexia and I'm currently trying to maintain my weight now at 6'5"" and 203lbs. I shift weight a lot since I am a peculiar eater(try to lean on more healthy options and such but I may splurge on the wrong things, etc ) and I will try to correct my sleeping habbits,  depression and anxiety will sometimes keep me awake all night or I'll feel a severe lack of energy.

Otherwise, thank you for the furthering support! I take it you've felt your fair share and/or may still be dealing.
Thank you."

depression,epdi1wu,t1_epdgpx0,1559166644.0,"I have tried Duloxetine on different doses, from 20-100 and I dont take well to the drugs (did not like the side effects, and I'm very particular about drugs and how they effect me.)

I have a Local Therapist I'm going to see. This will be my first appointment, in August.

I speak with family occasionally, and I'm trying meditation techniques and such. I walk frequently as It is a source of relief though like many things Art, Reading and hobbies I loose interest more so  frequently."
