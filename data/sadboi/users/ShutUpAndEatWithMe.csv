science,fmzsqch,t1_fmz2kvg,1586528764.0,"Metals have a ""sea of electrons"" that makes them conductive, but this also allows metal ions to come off of the surface. Copper is a necessary trace element but toxic in high amounts. Bacteria are unicellular organisms with no organs, so they take things in from their environment with passive and active transport. In passive transport, they have limited control of what they can take in; in these cases, they can't stop taking in copper until they die. Some bacteria that evolved in high copper environments have developed active transport mechanisms to prevent toxicity. 

The texture of a surface may be an antimicrobial because it just doesn't allow the bacteria to stick. Biofilms are a huge problem in medicine because bacteria in this form are resistant to antimicrobials and other external stresses.There have been some studies that show that the surface topology not only influences the pattern they grow and adhere, but prevent them from sticking at all. In [2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-28454-2), they found that you can texture a surface so bacteria can roll off like water (hydrophobicity). In this paper, it looks like they added upon that with a porous texture that breaks open membranes.

They might not understand how dark the depths can be because they've never been there, but I don't understand how it feels to be part of a loving family. It doesn't stop me from being happy for them.

I didn't have interest in makeup and I was both too poor and insecure to dress differently than I already did. Still, it was comforting to know my friends still liked the same things I did, and sad when others correlated the change in outward appearances with the interests we once shared."

I don't know how different things can be in Argentina, but even in my shitty rural high school, the counselors kind of sucked and seemed out of touch (they told me to apply to only one college lol). And going to them for something like this would have made it dangerous for me to go back home."
powerwashingporn,fl0kyy5,t1_fl0i39o,1584709506.0,I like it too but I've read that it's good to clean them on occasion because it's not good for the structural integrity of the material. It doesn't look like this walkway has any of that nice green stuff anyways

LSD,fkxtc1g,t1_fkvy86v,1584635033.0,"The answers below are not wrong, but here is a more in-depth answer if you're interested, because PCR is such a huge part of my life:

PCR is short for **P**olymerase **C**hain **R**eaction. Polymerases are enzymes (protein machines) that replicate DNA. The chain reaction is exponential; if you had 1 copy of a gene, the polymerase makes 1, so you have 2. Then 4, 8, 16, etc.

DNA is made of chemicals we call A, T, C, and G, for short. Due to their chemical nature, As pair up with Ts, Cs bind with Gs. They form a chain (*e.g,* GCTA) and there will be a complementary chain (*e.g.,* CGAT, but biologists call a complementary strand a *reverse complement* and the proper way to say it is actually TAGC but this is can be confusing to beginners) to form a double strand of DNA. This double strand is the famous ""double helix."" DNA exists in this form because it's more safe and stable, but it can't replicate itself as a double helix which is needed every time a cell doubles. To make DNA copies, the double strand is opened and these polymerases fit in. For every A or C, they add a T or G, respectively, making a backwards complement of the original. 

One of the genius things is that you can add something called a ""primer,"" which are short single stranded sequences of DNA that guides the polymerase to the location you want it to go. A version of primers are used in CRISPR for the specific gene editing it's known for (*e.g.,* disease X has a unique sequence of AGCG; if you have a primer for it of CGCT, CRISPR will go to that gene). If you know a part of the COVID-19 sequence, you can design a primer that is complementary to the COVID-19 gene of interest for replication. You only need a small amount of starting DNA because of the exponential replication. If someone has COVID, the DNA will be amplified; if they do not, there is no sequence to be amplified. 

This is revolutionary technology so it doesn't stop in identifying a pathogen. It's also used for criminal forensics, identifying microbiomes, genetic engineering, etc. 

Please let me know if some parts don't make sense and/or you would like to know more."
