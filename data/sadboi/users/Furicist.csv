I used to check discrepancies between banks Forex deal confirmations and fix them before their due date to prevent either bank losing money.

We had a department of 8. 1 manager, 1 Sup, 6 clerks. I was a clerk and 19 years old. I got the job on interview when everyone else was a graduate.

They'd do one deal at a time, find a discrepancy, print it, walk to the printer, staple it, then find the problem and email it to the relevant department. Taking perhaps 30 minutes per discrepancy.

I used screenshots and cut and paste. Emails would be done in 30 seconds and I'd be on to the next one.

Tips for working in these environments.

Base layer and socks, wool is king. Stays warm when wet. Try to get merino wool if you can. Pricey but you'll be so happy you will not regret it.

Mid layer, hydrophobic down or synthetic down, but not regular goose down. Layer your core and it'll keep your hands warm as vasoconstriction won't kick in. Also, hydrophobic down and synthetic down don't lose all their loft if you sweat in to them, but goose down does.

Outer layer, water resistant and breathable, try to have big vents and a long fit jacket. Long fit so the wind doesn't chill your butt when you're bent over and vents for when you're working hot.

Try to have a second midlayer that's a bit thinner too so on warmer days you can swap it out...or even add it on if you're extra cold.

Gloves, I've always kept mittens inside my midlayers right next to my torso. They stay super warm there (warmer than in your pockets) so if your hands get cold, you pop these mittens in and they're like little heaters. Never out your gloves down on the grounds they'll freeze and you'll be miserable for hours.

Put a waxy layer on your face, like piz buin mountain, it stops the snow and ice sticking to your skin as much.

Balaclava and beanie hat if you can get one thin enough to go under your helmet.

Don't cover your mouth with a balaclava, it's the dumbest fashion ever, the fabric gets wet and makes your face colder.

Any more tips, add them on! Stay warm guys!"

mentalillness,f8qrtro,t3_e1m3i7,1574722696.0,"NOTE: Nothing I am about to say is intended to cause offence. Nothing I am about to say is intended to be sarcastic. It is going to be very clearly outlined on what I have experienced when chaperoning an autistic athlete that I work with.He is capable of having a job, driving a car and competing in sport at a high level, with support.

You arent a freak at all. But you are different. You know you are different and sometimes, people will notice. Sometimes they don't understand how to react because they can't guess you are autistic, so they guess how they should handle the situation.

Most people who react badly are usually reacting badly because they either don't know someone who is autistic, or they dont understand autism.

In a situation where someone is unaware you are on the spectrum and lack experience interacting with someone who is on the spectrum, you know more about what is happening than they do. You aren't inept, they are. You, in these situations are the one who can teach someone something. You can teach them what autism is, what you are good at and what you aren't so good at, for example, you mentioned sarcasm and social cues. So, someone who was previously unaware of how to handle a conversation or interaction with someone who has autism, could leave that conversation knowing something more, such as to avoid autism, speak clearly and show their social cues more clearly. I coach an autistic athlete in elite snowboarding and its fine. It isn't difficult whatsoever to interact with him. Sometimes, conversations with him can last longer than required, but I know that he doesnt know when a conversation should end, so I know it is up to me to be direct when I feel we have both benefited as much as we can from the conversation and I'll recap what we have covered and end the conversation. There, easy.

It isnt that easy with everyone that is autistic however as someone who is neurtypical. Everyone on the spectrum is unique, just the same as everyone who isnt on the spectrum. Some are more challenging to interact with and some are so easy, I would never even realise were autistic. So, sometimes, simpy the announcement that you are on the spectrum will not help much and someone who is neurotypical would benefit from just the shortest briefing possible, ""I just struggle with social cues and sarcasm, but other than that, I'm doing great in life!"" would be more than enough for someone to now have all the information they need to make your interactions successful, productive and most of all, relaxing. You wont be as confused, they will know what to do and they'll have learned a lot about how to have a positive interaction."

The only negative experiences I've had when sharing my emotions has been with women such as female friends or girlfriends. I have depression and I have had it for the best part of 11 years now.

When I can no longer cope and my mask slips, its always women telling me to man up, get over it, toughen up, crack on and suck it up. Even been called a princess before.

Other men and some women who arent judging me will be more supportive or offer to listen/help. Usually all I need is just a bit of social time, a distraction or someone to spend time with to help me break the rumination cycle. But having these dismissive, minimising comments are devestating. It's happened many times from many people and it's making it harder and harder for me to open up to people.

It's getting to the point that I've been suppressing my emotions so frequently that im struggling to feel positive emotions. Happiness, excitement, love, all hard to feel. But sadness, sorrow, despair, its like a black hole opens up and swallows me whole in seconds. I'm working on it (and im functional, I am at the top of my game with work and so on) but I really struggle to feel happy. I often fake laughing or smiling because I'm in so much pain that if I let someone see and they react badly, I'll crack.

Please, if you see a man who needs to share, dont tell him hes just got to get on with it. Just listen and try to help him break the rumination cycle, its much harder for a man to show his vulnerability in this society."

They are the highest paid trade in the UK have have been for a long time and have good career prospects if they're keen to progress. Every electrician I have spoken to have said it's a good career with the exception of one who was fired for being a dick (he was a real dickhead and has since been fired from his other jobs he's done).

Things electricians moan about:
Their knees
Their back


Using knee pads is something the older guys beg the younger guys to do. Looking after your back as well.

Many who have discussed it receive a couple of shocks in their career and gotten away with it, usually doing something that was overtly dangerous to try to save time as they'd become complacent. I guess that's an important lesson in itself, to be disciplined in doing it right.

The career is forecast to have an increase in demand. With the advent of electrical boilers, electrical cars, LED lighting and the general increase in the use of electrical devices around the home (and industry), electricians salaries have been increasing above inflation for quite a long time. This is specifically refering to the UK, however.

If you ever plan on moving around, most countries have electricians listed on their urgent skills list, leading to relaxed visa controls which allows you to more easily live in another country with your job being a supportive factor in your application.

I was recently offered a Â£40,000 job (as an inexperienced electrician, but I have a lot of work at height experience, hydraulic servicing, etc.) And an apology about it not being as high as they think I'm worth...with the primary job being an electrician servicing industrial products they've sold.

Couldn't believe it. Didn't think I'd ever be worth that much....let's see if it plays out.

electricians,f7aiqhe,t1_f77r2j3,1573530310.0,"Bear in mind voltage drop to your house means not everyone gets 230V. it always varies a bit. So if you are getting close to the 13A limit, just a variation because of how far from the substation you are would be enough to send it over the limit.

UK Supply tolerances are currently: 216.2 volts to 253.0 volts.

Each connection adds resistivity, which reduces the protective capacity of the CPC and the RCD (or RCBO, depending on what you have in your setup). Fuses are designed to prevent fires, not electrocutions. Residual current devices are there to protect you from electrocution and they are in the CCU. The more resistence in the circuit there is, the harder it is for the RCD to operate as intended.

Just don't tempt fate. We all know daisy chaining is dangerous and for good reason.

The ring final circuit that you have upstairs will be rated to 32A, but it could be a radial and only rated to 16A and even then it could be a spur which complicates things further. Each wall socket should hopefully be rated to 13A at the socket itself like the typical ones you find in any electrical wholesaler.

The ability of the wiring to cope with load degrades over time and pushing it close to its rated limit accelerates that process. How old the wiring is will have a big impact on the resistivity of that circuit supplying that socket and the higher the resistivity, the quicker it'll heat up, causing further breakdown.

Does the circuit have other rooms on it? Are they drawing from it also? If you go to your CCU, is the circuit labelled? If you flick it off and check which other sockets no longer have power, what is usually on those sockets? What does the MCB say is its rating in amps?

You may well have to consider what else is on that circuit if you are planning on powering everything off one circuit."

At the start, cut the pipe longer than it needs to be. The bend is never in the perfect point on the pipe so a bit extra on each end really helps as you can then just cut the ends to size once you're done. Then do the bend, then do the final measuring and cut it properly afterwards. If it is possible to offer it up and just mark off where to do the final cuts, that is always quickest.

At first, underbend. You can easily add extra to the bend, but you can't take any off. So bend it to 95%, check it, then add a bit in each time until you have it right.

If doing a 90 degree bend, quickest way to check accuracy is to offer it up to a door frame if there is one nearby.

If you are doing a set, less is more, delicate bending is better than being ham fisted and overcooking it.

Put it in place before doing the final cuts. Don't try to rely on measurements all the time from your tape.

Loads of sharpie. Also remember which side of the sharpie mark is your reference point, make sure you cut on the edge of that point, not in the middle of it, if that makes sense.

Hopefully that helps."

The standard is that the CPC should run to wherever the line runs. The manufacturers design will have guidance in the box that will point out that there is an earth terminal on each light fitting. They don't put them there to look pretty. If an incident occurred and you left it unbonded, they'll find that right away, compare it to the manufacturers guidance (which plays a part in deciding how things are responsibly set up) and have cause to question you.

What about if the light malfunctions, someone takes the cover off to inspect and breaks the bond, then is electrocuted by a now energized light fitting because you didnt bond it?

If the connection between the light fitting, cover, screw, pattress and then to the CPC is aged, the resistivity will increase meaning that the protection afforded by that bonding may not be as effective as when installed. You have to think 10 years from now, will I still trust this arrangement? I'd answer no and whack some bonding in there if I can fit it. When we bond back boxes on steel conduit, we dont just do the first one and assume itll be ok.

Imagine this. The light is struck and snaps off on its stalk, interrupting the CPC, the insulation on the line is damaged meaning that because no fly lead was installed, the light fitting is now energized. In one incident, both the bonding has been interrupted and the line has come in to contact with the casing.

Just bond it. Takes 10 mins."
