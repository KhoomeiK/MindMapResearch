depression,fiaqle6,t3_f791jw,1582306479.0,I suffer from depression and one of the ways I fight back against it is martial arts training.  It's interesting how the body and mind correlate thoughts and feelings.  I bruised a rib a few months back and didn't even realize it for weeks because it felt very similar to the chest pain I feel when I get depressed.  I thought I was getting depressed again and started training even harder to fight it.  I kept pushing through it until it got so bad I couldn't breathe or bend over and I realized it was a physical problem.  My depression feels like a rib injury I guess.

I don't date as often now and my relationships don't usually last but I had one recently that lasted almost 2 years.  It ended 6 months ago and I still feel like I'm lying cold and naked on the floor, unable to move.  I just don't know if it's worth it.

No one knows that the reason my defense is so bad is because I like getting beat up and I feel like I deserve it.  I don't really know how to live or do anything for myself.

Someone may look at you and smile simply because they are having a good day and they also may not find you attractive.  Someone else may avoid looking at you because they find you very attractive and are afraid of you because of that.  Either way, it doesn't have much to do with you, it's much more about their state of mind and the way they choose to act.  It's important not to assume why others say or do certain things and also to realize the things they do and say are not personal."

MuayThai,f5a5i1j,t3_dna9uv,1572100825.0,"Others have given good advice here regarding taking a step with your standing leg vs hopping into the kick.  I would add that you should step to the outside a bit more to open your hips. Think about taking a small step to a 45 degree angle to the outside of the bag, remaining on the ball of your foot and rotating your hips and shoulders together with your kick.  One thing that helped me improve my rotation is thinking about pulling my opposite shoulder back and keeping my hips and shoulders turning in sync with each other.    


Also, you are totally not fat and you're doing many things right by training, asking questions and showing genuine interest in improving your technique.  Stay as positive as you can and keep up the good work brother!"

MuayThai,f3n9y4r,t3_dhbpdv,1570996273.0,"My coaches are all really good, but really different in their own ways and although they each teach differently, they always say you need to figure out what works for you and your body.  Figure out what your natural advantages are and adopt the techniques that reinforce those.  I'm fairly tall and skinny, so I tend to be more of a long fighter.  For example, some of coaches teach the 'american' hook with your palm facing toward you.  This type of hook does not work well for me and my body, so I always throw 'european' hooks with my palm facing down.  It's a blessing to be shown multiple ways to throw the same punch so you can pick whichever style feels most effective for your body and style."

Personally, if I were you and I was backed into a corner and had no choice but to defend myself, I would focus on protecting my head and getting into elbow range.  Elbows are fast, powerful, they don't break like your hands and if he's trying to grab you, his face is probably wide open.

Also, any kind of training is going to be a huge advantage.  The average 'completely untrained' dude I see in day one of our kickboxing classes throws big looping haymakers you can see from a mile away and has little to no understanding of defense."

I saw below you mentioned you feel like you don't have a lot of focus or attention span.  I had this issue too and meditation really helped me.  All you have to do is get into a comfortable position and focus on your breath.  Start with just 5 minutes.  It will be hard at first, as you will probably get carried away by thoughts, but that's ok, just notice that your focus shifted from your breath and return your attention to your breath.  This will help you in many more ways that you might think.  It is directly training your focus and attention, just like strengthening a muscle, soon you will find it easier to engage in things and you will notice yourself feeling more present, more in the moment.  It also trains you to be gentle and compassionate with yourself.  When your thoughts wander, tell yourself it's ok and you are training yourself and getting better.  I know exactly what it's like to constantly be living in scenarios in your mind, I did it for over a decade and eventually I learned that I can't really live a full life like that.  I have to be present.  I know it's hard to see or feel anything when it's so dark, but just start doing small things for yourself like meditating for a few minutes each day.  If you are consistent with practice, I promise you will start seeing positive changes.  Hang in there, I believe you can have a happy and fulfilling life, you got this!"

It will feel like you've stepped in quicksand and you're going to slowly start suffocating again, but just like quicksand, you have to relax.  Relax and embrace the feeling.  It's ok to hurt and feel pain, but you don't have to suffer.  Suffering comes from fighting it, and often feeling like you are losing.  I am in a lot of pain much of the time and my brain is programmed to dig a trench and try to fight a long hard battle against it, but I'm learning that you don't have to fight in order to win.  It may sound counter intuitive, but if you can manage to relax and embrace your feelings, it will be a lot easier to maintain a perspective where you can do things you know are good for you.  Stay relaxed and try to lay into the quicksand.  It will be scary and painful, but that's ok.  You will get better and you will be stronger.  You don't even have to believe you'll ever get out, just relax and keep doing the things you know are good for you.  You won't sink if you stay calm, I promise.  Stay strong fellow human.

I've really struggled to find lasting success. A certain medication, behavior or change in mindfulness will help me for a while, but I slip back into depression each time. Training in Muay Thai has had a huge positive influence on me in so many ways and I believe it's a piece of the puzzle to heal my mind.

To answer your question, the last time I felt like I was losing the battle with myself to show up to class, I forced myself to open up to one of my coaches. I had a panic attack when I tried to talk to him, but he was patient with me until I could calm down enough to communicate. I told him I valued coming to class, but I was struggling with my mind and I needed help. He said he would do whatever he could to help. He started texting me to check in with how I was doing and hold me accountable for coming to class. Finding the courage to open up to someone gave me strength. I'm trying to open up to more people.
