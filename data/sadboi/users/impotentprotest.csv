ARFID,fosdhji,t3_g996cl,1588028574.0,"Sometimes when I think too hard about the fact that I'm chewing and swallowing and that stuff is touching my lips (I know it sounds strange), I get so put off and I lose my appetite and will feel sick. I try to distract myself by reading a book or scrolling on my phone as I eat, to help this feeling."
ARFID,flpuu10,t1_flotyx4,1585369465.0,It's hard  :/ I can relate to that a lot.  I find that trying to eat multiple times a day rather than trying to fit it all in one go helps.
ARFID,flbdyzd,t3_fnrypz,1585002673.0,"I understand how you feel. I dislike eating, it's such a chore but I do it because I don't want to lose weight and get to an extremely unhealthy state once again. It's really validating going on this subreddit and knowing that there are other people who have a similar struggle, when these past few years people have been telling me that I'm weird and crazy, and every ed program I've gone to seems to have invalidated my problems because I don't fit into the ""classic"" mold."
Anxiety,flajv2x,t3_fnkhwc,1584985316.0,"In some ways, I'm finding the alone time and lack of stress from school to be a nice break. However I still find the situation incredibly concerning and I worry about my family."
Anxiety,fl7dia7,t3_fmuheb,1584899505.0,"I experience this very often. It makes it hard to eat and function because I'm scared to get sick. I remember I used to coincidentally get the ""stomach flu"" right before presentations at school. Now I'm thinking that it was a result of being very stressed."
Anxiety,fl7d2bz,t3_fn1ual,1584899246.0,"Yes and it makes my anxiety worse. Sometimes it comes up when I'm feeling stressed, other times it seems to appear out of nowhere and it concerns me. I recently had some problems with tachycardia and had to go get a test done, and the person testing me was surprised to see someone young. The affect that anxiety seems to have on physical health frightens me."
Anxiety,fl7b5c5,t3_fmyb7k,1584898116.0,"Yep. Sometimes I'm up all night with thoughts despite feeling tired. This one time that it happened I went and had some sort of double espresso. It definitely did not help my anxiety, would not reccomend."
ARFID,fl7ad4h,t1_fl2qgzq,1584897654.0,"I feel as though it is a physical issue for me too. Eating disorder professionals tell me that the pain is in my head. GI professionals and medical doctors run tests on me and tell me that there are physical reasons for the pain. At this point I don't know who to believe, probably a mix of both.
Sorry about your therapist not being very understanding about your struggle."
Anxiety,fl2ntg3,t1_fl2mj2x,1584755466.0,"It really is hard but one of the best skills that I've learned. Thank you, you as well."
Anxiety,fl2luki,t3_eupik4,1584754113.0,"I'm very worried about the risk of some of my family members getting sick. It's also concerning to me that right now where I live, not many mental health resources are currently accessible. Everything seems surreal and I'm trying to practice radical acceptance to get through this difficult time."
ARFID,fl2kwxc,t3_flqknp,1584753475.0,"Hi. I really relate to what you wrote about eating feeling like a chore. I too struggle to finish meals as I don't like eating past fullness (physically uncomfortable/painful) and I have struggled for years with unintentional weight loss. Sorry I don't really have advice, but I hope that you find someone who can support you through your struggles."
Anxiety,fl2jvu1,t3_flvow6,1584752764.0,Yes and it's awful. I remember a stressful time in my life where I developed several stomach ulcers and it was so painful and terrible.
Anxiety,fl2jqnn,t1_fl0vf7g,1584752664.0,Same. The thought of food makes me feel sick during times of extreme stress.
ARFID,fl1jv92,t1_fl0lea4,1584730445.0," I'm sorry that you have to go through this, but it's interesting to know that someone relates. What your dietician is doing sounds like a helpful approach. All the programs that I've been forcefully sent to so far focused so much on body image, which sort of made me feel invalidated because I've spent a fair portion of my life wishing to gain weight. However, my current dietician has been sort of helpful trying to incorporate small but dense foods in my day to day life so that's good."
ARFID,fkzl91g,t1_fkzghbo,1584673673.0,"Yes I often have trouble swallowing, and I feel nauseous a lot while and after eating which stresses me out because I'm afraid of throwing up..."
EDAnonymous,fkyu0du,t3_fle86o,1584656129.0,"Sort of. I avoid foods that cause me stomach pains and sometimes I get put off by a certain texture/ taste. But it often varies. The main issue from me is early satiety, since I get full quite quickly and hence struggle to eat enough to properly sustain myself :/"
Anxiety,fkw3znp,t3_fl01tl,1584582945.0,That's an interesting way to look at it. Thank you for this.
ARFID,fjf8cf7,t3_fc6whm,1583286448.0,"Are you me... this is eerily similar to my own experience with an ed. I feel like I'm reading a story of how my life has been these past few years. From being hospitalized and misdiagnosed with AN, recieving horrible comments from my family and feeling frustrated from the lack of help I was recieving. I felt like I was constantly needing to make shit up in order to fit in at group therapy. I relapsed because I had given up on the program that I was seeing, and I wasn't being monitored physically which lead me to slowly lose weight unintentionally. At my worst point when I was terribly underweight I was actually eating fast food every day in an attempt to gain. I'm glad that I'm not alone in this, and I'm so sorry that you had to endure that. I am now in treatment again and the team is considering the diagnosis of ARFID since they agree that it suits me best. I'm hoping that this time around, things will go better. 
Stay strong :)"
