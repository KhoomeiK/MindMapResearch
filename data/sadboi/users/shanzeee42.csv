Random_Acts_Of_Pizza,fqzkivd,t3_glskq6,1589769330.0,"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer

I first read this book about 10 years ago when in high school and have yet to watch the movie simply because it could never capture my favorite part about book which is the writers extremely unique method of ending the book. One of the main characters loses their ability to speak word by word throughout the story and starts using a notepad to communicate.. eventually the character runs out of blank space in the note pad and the book ends with words jumbled up on each other until you can’t read them anymore. Doesn’t sound nearly as awesome as it is to experience first hand but a wonderful story regardless. Jonathan Foer only has two novels but both are exceedingly unique in their writing styles"

I also found what might have been an antique Japanese screen but it was hard to date. Sadly no one around here appreciated it so I sold it for $60 (still fucking killer for trash). This week I found a $1000 TV that only needs a $20 part that’s easy to replace

Neither had a signature which supposedly is a sign of age because back in the day artists were afraid to be seen as vain if their art was to make it to the Shogun/emperor"

At first I would put him in the bathroom when I left for work and they would both just cry the whole time from opposite sides of the door.. after a few days I couldn’t stand it anymore- I also knew how gentle Chief was with ‘babies’ (anything smaller than him “be easy Chief, it’s a baby”) anyways I came home to them cuddled up like this and it’s my only response to anyone that tells me how aggressive all pits are.
