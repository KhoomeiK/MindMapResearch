SASSWitches,fornc07,t3_g95e8v,1588015143.0,i really like the star spinner tarot! it's so inclusive and the artwork is just gorgeous. i also think animal-themed tarot decks might be a good idea too if you aren't attached to having humans in your deck! i also second crow tarot!

AnimalCrossing,fo2wgdt,t3_g52tua,1587475710.0,i love your app so much! does the ad revenue pay you or would you prefer us buying the paid version? i want to support you as much as i can!

TarotDecks,fmuqzfh,t1_fmpjlsq,1586396991.0,i'm a mix of ENTJ/INTJ! knight of pentacles/king of wands definitely fits!
TarotDecks,fljxp31,t1_flijd29,1585229344.0,"yes! i hope more decks start doing that!! it is such an amazing idea! i do agree, i do wish they had done a bit more with the hermit too, but i imagine it's probably hard to think up amazing ideas for each card! and there's the always the fear of losing the obvious traditional imagery! 

i hope you fall in love with it too! i've only used it a few times still so i'm not 100% familiar yet, but i am pretty choosey about my decks so i typically need to feel really connected to them before purchasing. i still felt a connection and appreciation right away! good luck with connecting to yours!"
TarotDecks,flh4we2,t3_foh4gs,1585156143.0,"i have only done a few readings with mine so far, but i feel my readings turned out well. i feel like the deck meshes with how i read! i feel like the swords/wands may be lacking in imagery a bit, but i actually think the coins and chalices seem to have a lot of effort put into them. i love the inclusivity behind the deck, so i'm personally okay with some of the simplicity!"
tarot,fl667v5,t3_fmjfb4,1584855799.0,i preordered this in november and they keep delaying the shipment date because i'm not prime! reordered it with a prime account and hoping it gets here soon! such a gorgeous deck!
TarotDecks,fkxzwbq,t3_fl8q2z,1584638670.0,i have the oracle deck that has these on one side and i love them! i'll admit i hate the updated version though. the original kickstarter and oracle decks had a way better card background that made it look super old timey!
BeautyGuruChatter,fkvd0yk,t1_fkvcooe,1584566741.0,"i'm on that same page! i don't want much beauty content anymore, but if she put out an equally gorgeous palette i'd be all over it!"
BeautyGuruChatter,fkvcitd,t1_fkvccdd,1584566448.0,i agree. don't put in half the effort (if it can even be called that) to rectify the issue and then expect your brand to recover. i really wanted the palette when it came out and i'm so glad i passed now that i know what an awful company they are!
BeautyGuruChatter,fkvc773,t1_fkvc546,1584566260.0,exactly! luckily it's so easy to screenshot it and never let it die these days
BeautyGuruChatter,fkvbu4q,t3_fkupf6,1584566054.0,"they turned off their comments on all their instagram posts, so you know they're trying to keep this on the down low. always a bad and shady move in my opinion."

TarotDecks,fklegkd,t3_fj7dqa,1584304566.0,"the only time i don't read reversals is if the deck isn't based on the RW system. i have the wildwood tarot and it is based on the greenwood tarot, which is very loosely based off of RW. i personally feel like a lot of the cards don't match up to RW, so i skip reversals in that instance and rely more heavily on the guidebook. 

it's really up to you! i personally feel i get more out of using all 156 meanings vs just 78. you can always use thetarotguide.com or other similar sites for reversal meanings!"

Tarotpractices,fhwai7c,t3_f52hyt,1581910558.0,"1. What I resist
5 of Pentacles: I am about to buy a house and, in the negotiation process, I have been struggling to find a balance between what the seller's want and what we can actually afford. I need to resist fearing this impending financial blow and instead trust in my financial-savvy self. I know that we will bounce back and I'm not alone in this situation.

2. What I support
The Star: Believing in my inner light. I have endured hardships recently, but that doesn't stop me from supporting myself and continuing to shine bright. 

3. What will flow
3 of Swords: Heartbreak may be in my future- whether it is something I had my heart set on or otherwise. If I wisely prepare myself for it, I will learn more about myself and be stronger in the end.

My buddy is u/atomicadie"

Tarotpractices,fhr3b3w,t3_f4j785,1581816247.0,"1. What am I not seeing right now?

The Hermit:  Practicing introspection has not helped clarify things in my life. I have closed myself off from my inner guidance during this stressful time. I need to rebalance and take some alone time to reprioritize.

2. What do my guides want me to know?

Five of Acorns (Wands) Reversed:  There will be disagreements while house hunting with my partner and that I must not avoid conflict. I need to embrace it as we are two different people with two different sets of wants and needs. While we can agree to disagree, disagreements are expected in this process and I should embrace it.

3. How can I reconnect with my inner passion for my life?

Eight of Shells (Cups): *Used the Spiritsong meaning for this one*
I need to go on a quest and renew myself. Lately I have been a stressed out wreck. I have been spending every waking moment being productive. But I am on the path to burn myself out and I need to find a way to relax before I actually do so. 

4. What do I need to let go to of to move forward
King of Acorns (Wands): I need to be the leader in my life and take charge of what I envision my future looking like. I can't be scared of the unknown any longer and I need to make my goals and plans reality. I need to be motivated to to reprioritize these goals, rejuvenate myself, and not be scared to fight for what I want and need.

This spread really told me I need to figure things out and work on myself for myself! House hunting/prepping to move has made my productivity skyrocket at (almost) the cost of my own well being. The process has also caused plenty of disagreements between me and my partner. It is good to disagree sometimes and we work well together. I need to take charge of my own mental health and well being while finding a way to feasibly reach our goals.

Tarotpractices,fgkrh0q,t1_fgkqk2b,1580871975.0,"This card honestly gave me a lot of trouble! I don't really connect with the suit of wands. I ended up using the guide book because i felt the imagery for this card wasn't speaking to me. I used a combination of one of the RW keywords, expansion, and the book. 

The book says: 
""Nourishment from a spiritual source gives inner security and joy. Goals and desires are reached, making life rich with emotional scrutiny and a sense of completion. ""

The reason I focused less on the spiritual source is because I personally practice secular tarot. I also felt this card connected to the previous card, the Eight of Stones. I am personally a very goal-oriented person and I really need to learn to trust my gut instinct/rationale a lot more than I do so I can actually achieve all that I want to."
Tarotpractices,fgkn81n,t3_ez1xo4,1580869390.0,"1. For body:
Ten of Stones (Pentacles): Home; Allow trusted friends and family to offer security and affection. I put on a hard exterior so I don't seem weak to anyone. Instead of hiding my pain or fears from my loved ones, I should allow them to support me and love me when I am feeling vulnerable.

2. For heart:
Eight of Stones (Pentacles): Skill; Concentration and dedication when developing skills can be used for successful labor and love. By developing my skills further. I will be able to love others more and feel more fulfillment from what I enjoy. I think dedicating more time to my hobbies and developing these skills will increase my happiness.

3. Of mind:
Three of Bows (Wands): Fulfillment;
I need to listen to my inner voice. Refining and focusing my energy will allow for meaningful achievements. Taking care of my mind and listening to my inner voice will allow me to trust in myself more.

I used the Wildwood Tarot. This is my hardest deck to read with, but I want to challenge myself. These cards don't always follow the traditional RW meanings, so I tried to use my intuition as much as possible. Any insights are welcome!

no problem, we all need to vent sometimes and your feelings are totally valid! my dm's are always open if you ever need someone to talk to!

1. Me as I am:
Judgement reversed: I am currently doubting myself and criticizing myself too much about the situation. I couldn't have feasibly foreseen this happening, so I need to be more understanding and just learn from this situation in the future! *I also drew this for my daily card, so it sounds like Judgement is calling me out! 

2. Am I on the correct path? 
Nine of Swords reversed: I am currently filled with inner turmoil as I am incredibly stressed and the situation seems too slow moving to be solved anytime soon. I need to release these worries so that I am not consumed by my own fears.

3. What is the main obstacle? 
I need to let go and surrender my anxieties. I need to have a new perspective on the situation and stop making up all the possible scenarios in my head.

4. What is helping me?
The Star: I am feeling very hopeful about the situation ending in my favor. I have faith that things will turn out okay no matter what happens. 

5. How can progress be made?
Ten of Pentacles: I need to focus on the long-term success of continuing to fight in the situation rather than trying to fix this immediately. I also see this as a sign that I will be moving towards being more financially secure after the situation is over, as it is a financial dispute. 

Overall I think the cards want me to relax and have some faith in what evidence I already have! Harder said than done, but the solution is clear to me.
