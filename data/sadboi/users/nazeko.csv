AskReddit,ez0x7zg,t1_eyztj5k,1567643175.0,Im bipolar and I can certainly vouch for this! It's quite bothersome for most of my friends but it's good to be reminded I'm in a manic speech mode cause no matter how hard I try I still can't hold myself back..

""Ahhhh damn look at me! I can draw again! I think I can totally make something really awesome!""  
and then stop drawing after a fuckin LINE!"

AmItheAsshole,ey1bdjv,t1_exyvhk5,1566695020.0,"It's been stressed into this discussion that it's unhealthy to do that, overspending and impulsive actions and plus OP is concerned about these habits.

 I think imo if we're gonna point out what she's being judged is OP is assuming that she isn't trying to look for her own hobbies THROUGH exploring it with someone. Maybe the friend almost exclusively wants to try out things  when someone well knowledgeable to them are into it. Though I might be giving too much credit, who knows.

YTA in the end for calling out because it's like she can't ever have the same hobby with the person she's with. The money concern, it was helpful but could've been said into a different point altogether (like mate, you're having fun, but you're spending so much shit.) And not assume they're gonna break up and never gonna go back to those hobbies ever again. Maybe for those attempts she hasn't kept anything but I think she'd eventually find that hobby if she enjoys it regardless if  she's in a relationship/through the relationship or not."

bipolar,exgtzwp,t1_exdywez,1566275132.0,"Ohhhh that's a good idea thanks, I'll meet her this september and I'll ask if I can finally remove one medicine.  
Usually changing medicine involves drinking both at the same time, i guess i just need to accept some adjustment period too.   
Have you ever tried laying off meds? Is that so unhealthy to think about?"
bipolar,exdx0c5,t1_exdvo4q,1566189478.0,"I tried a proxy before and he's way worse.. he gives me medicine to every episode I have and screws up my sleep even more. I'll try to keep that in mind and try again, of course. and I told her that it's not getting cheaper already but she just shrugs it off and I usually just suck it up.."
