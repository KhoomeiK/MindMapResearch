relationships,fng998p,t3_g1gj2a,1586925534.0,"This is all too much, I’m so sorry you are having to go through this 

first; I’d try to talk to a therapist cuz honestly, I know you need a place to vent out this is goes beyond reddit, there are life’s who will have an influence on this  ( not only your or your kids, Anne’s ) and there are professionals that could help you 

What I would do: id take the kids to somewhere you know you are safe and you can get SUPORT from there ( honestly if you think your mom won’t be judgmental and won’t give you a headache more than you probably already have; go!) You need a safe place ( specially if you are pregnant!) 

Be prepared. Talk to a lawyer. See what you can do to keep your children’s safe. If you want, try to record your husband saying of those awful stuff again ( for court measures in the future, let’s not hope it happens but if his family decides to just swept you and your kids under the carpet like they did with that girl, you need proof they don’t worth shit.) 

Tell your husband ( tell him in front of the whole fucking family cuz I can’t believe they hid that secret away from you!) to get in touch with the kid, otherwise you will. It isn’t your business, He owns  it to the kid, to his ( joe) and yours. what he said of being “trapped” and “having his life over” just shows he has never grown to be the man he needed to be. He needs to face the consequences of his actions"

mbti,f61utyj,t1_f60915f,1572647616.0,"Second this, although you really can’t expect things to go smoothly in any relationship (romantic or not ) if you don’t open up and share your personal boundaries and feelings. People can’t read minds and we all have different ways to view/act towards the world, if something bothers you and that person doesn’t know about, how do you want that person to change their actions towards you if you haven’t even mentioned that it hurts your feelings? 

Personal experience: I have a ENFJ sister, growing up we weren’t close at ALL. ( and we are twins, so pretty unusual ) I didn’t understand her and she didn’t understand me, we had good moments but those were rare, fought a lot bla bla bla anyways; when we decided to live together just the 2 of us to the same city bc we both endeuso getting into colleges that were in the same area, the first year was hell, I couldn’t open to her about my need to space and she needed constant support and attention to be happy. we fought a LOT because of it, but ended up understanding more of eachother personalities and boundaries, more than when we were at our parents house because in a tiny apt you can’t really space from each other. seriously if we had talked about it ( specially me opening it up cuz I bottled everything inside ) we wouldn’t have to suffer so much on that first year, she respects when I need time out and when she wants to talk or go out I compromise to go with her ( even if I don’t want to, there are days I can’t stand chatting but I know that if I don’t we will be sad, same thing with her knowing that if I don’t have time for myself *i* will be sad, so we respect your differences and things have been great, we truly became best friends to one another ) 
We balance things out and for 3 years we have been closer than ever. 

you don’t have to open up to EVERYONE. But as a introvert I can assure you that when you choose someone who respects you, that you trust, and that supports you no matter what; it’s the best feeling ever. We became so much closer and on the last few months she had to move out bc of a job offer, I loved being alone, I craved it, but I have grown being used to her around so much that I catch myself missing her and her endless chatting a lot. It sucks that I used to be independer and endeuso being a bit depended on her company to feel good,  but I wouldn’t change my relantionship with my sister for anything in the world 

Also idk if this is happening to you right now but I used not to have a great mother and daughter relationship as well, I thought my mom would never understand me or respect me so I never opened up to her. Ever. With this thing going on with my sister I decided to open up with my mom as well, and dude, even if you have a different way of living than your parents, different political views and shit, moms love their children like nothing else in the world, there is so many topics that I don’t agree with my mom and same thing with her towards me, but she cares, she listens to me, she wants to know if everything is ok and wants to help if I need to. moms just want happiness towards their children, it isn’t the worst thing to open up to them, you could tell her it’s hard, that maybe you won’t be as open as other people are, but that’s ok, tell her you will go to her if you need to and that she doesn’t need the constant worthiness towards you and your brother, I’m she just wants the best for you and she can’t know what’s the best for you if you don’t tell her."

dating_advice,f5xge1x,t1_f5x921x,1572540454.0,"You could always say a compliment towards her when you are like walking together something and try to hold her pinky with yours, to see if she reacts badly or not, if she holds it tighter than it’s a green light to hold her hand, when hanging around watching a movie or something, if you already have intimacy you can trace her hand with your finger tips, like do circular movements in her skin that it will built up anticipation, there are a goofy way to hold hands that I think it’s really cute; you ask then if the person can hold “this” for you, usually the person extend their hand and you just hold it, my friend used that one on me and I thought it was creative and adorable really. 


Also about doing the move about kissing, maybe when the mood is settled or you 2 are looking towards each other, you can do the “ tuck” ( the hell you say that in English ) her hair behind her ear, or caress her cheek, ( sometimes shy girls will look away, but is she’s smiling you should go for it) most of girls lean in and you can use the same hand to place behind neck, don’t pull her towards you, just like sort of follow her leaning in, if she stops and you go for it cuz some girls wants to see if you are real about them or not, so they wait for you to close the gap even if you are just extremely close"

You don’t have to tell at her infront of everyone, you could ask if you can talk just the two of you and apologize for hurting her feelings, that it wasn’t your intention but you are sorry eitherway it happen, that if she wants she can tell you when she gets upset because of your actions, instead of just being sad the whole day, ( if you are whiling to) you could ask what kind of stuff you do makes her sad, that you could work about changing bad habits about yourself because you care about her ( then you can drop the adorable “I care about you, more than a friend should” ) and see how she reacts.

I know you are trying to hold it all together but again, the least she could do is to talk to you, even if you don’t end up together anymore it shows you care about her as a person, like more than just a wife. Marriage is about companionships even in the hardest times, You know her past and and she knows yours. you know how death can shake things up, what you are going thought in your family is so hard, I’ve had 2 aunts with cancer in my family and I can’t even process how painful it must be to see your own son suffering with something like that.

I know life works mysterious ways and stuff but she’s really going for it while her son has cancer? She has the rights of wanting to explore her sexuality but you two should talk you know... like she’s being very selfish from what you are saying, and right now I’m sorry but with your son situation, right now is not the time to be selfish. Irl what happens between you two over the years, if you didn’t excel her expectations or otherwise, but you two got to be grown ups now and take care of your boy. Her leaving you or making you not sleep in the same bed will only cause stress to your kids, kids notice the “divorce tension” between their parents, and it sucks. I know it’s not right to shove problems aside but the LEAST she could do is to talk to you, you guys are still married after all, you both have responsibilities and it’s not right to just “welp this is hard!

There is a lot of interesting subs around here, but if that doesn’t happen; you would be surprised how relaxing it is. Also people don’t give a single damn if you are alone, after I started being vocal about it ( even like going to the cinemas alone ) I got a lot of “compliments” from it, a lot of my friends thought said they were “envious”, that it was brave to be on their own as well in those situations, that they don’t think they could handle it etc. being alone is not as bad as it sounds, like having company is nice but having time to focus on yourself is really nice as well :) 

Although I would recommend sitting without someone on your side at the cinemas, when I went to watch endgame ( it was full so I didn’t had much of a choice ) but where was a scene when I got scared and screamed “SON OF A BITCH” really loudly, jumped a bit so there was popcorn everywhere. both of the people next to me started laughing their ass off nsbfjgkfidkdd I lowkey wanted to die but it was indeed funny cuz I’m very jumpy/dorky and stuff, it was impossible not to laugh so I’m the end it was all good 😆"

I’m happy you are getting married and that you are a cancer survivor, I understand about being in the fattest situation in life, I’m there as well and sometimes it’s a hard kick in the butt. But I’m sure your husband loves you and you will look amazing for the wedding, you are so strong and you should believe in yourself! 
I’m sorry that you got fired and about your grandpa, but chin up! Try to Focus on the good things that are happening in your life ok? Don’t dwell on your problems in your wedding day, I know it’s hard but focus on your love for him and his love for you, and how everyone around you is also happy and there for you both 💞"

I know it sucks that woman in relationships are expected to be wife’s and moms for their husbands, it isn’t fair and I’m sure you must be tired.  I’m sorry :( 

You two could go to therapy, and have a serious conversation to him you are almost drawing a line between your relationship. That this is serious and he should start making a change for real. Also maybe give gun to him if he doesn’t want to brush his teeth all the time? I mean how does he have a white colar job if he smells? He could lose his job if the keeps dong that, 

Also tell him you are saying all of this because you love him, he will get defensive from hearing just critics, but in life you need to old habits to die and if this one is being a pain in the ass even for other people ( aka you, and probably your son who is bound pick it up those habits/ mirror his father actions ) then he needs to change

Also, I saw some comments of ppl just showering one every 2 days (3-5 a week ) and cleaning the stinky areas with a cloth, I personally find is disgusting ( but I’m from a tropical country so if you don’t shower /brush your teeth everyday you will smell... so it’s more of a cultural thing. I can’t even think how would someone would smell like from not taking a shower in 10 days... ) but maybe that could help your case? To wash maybe his neck, armpits, “southern areas” and feet ) maybe it will help,"
