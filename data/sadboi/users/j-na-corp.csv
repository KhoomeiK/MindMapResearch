BPDmemes,f9iv4kj,t3_e51sbs,1575346801.0, Without thinking or anything I had to delete them despite how badly I wanted to keep them. It‚Äôs too much and I know I‚Äôm gonna purposely trigger myself with them. This shit sucks

I‚Äôll find ways to make it into ‚Äú...they‚Äôre doing this because of x and x and they want x.‚Äù I feel you, op and it‚Äôs not fun. I wish I could just accept it as love and not their form of manipulation."

BPD,f6y7qsk,t3_dtm9ep,1573270266.0,I was feeling like shit and all round bad about being single because I never feel truly happy and motivated unless I‚Äôm with another woman but like this made me feel a lot better. I‚Äôm not worried she‚Äôs talking to other women or slowly drifting away I‚Äôm just chillin üòé
BPD,f6k9mva,t3_drl37n,1572908165.0,"Yes, I def. did in the past. For about a year straight I was high from the moment I got up to the moment I fell asleep. and if  I woke up in the middle of the night, I'd smoke and then go back to sleep. It did not do me very well and I've officially stopped. Weed is great but I strongly stand by the fact that only in moderation and when you're old enough. I started smoking at 14 and that really did take a toll on me negatively. I wish I could smoke again but I know myself and my personality, I'd go straight back to being high all day everyday. :/"
parrots,f63b3e5,t3_dqfa2d,1572674401.0,this photo + the caption is the best thing I‚Äôve ever seen on the internet. Thank you.
BPD,f63aqb5,t3_dqg1bt,1572674233.0,"I can so completely relate to this. Having a relationship for me is the most exhilarating experience, the highest of highs and then when it‚Äôs over it‚Äôs the lowest of lows. So I end up horrified of being in another relationship but at the same time craving that intense happiness. This disorder is a rollercoaster I tell ya!"

AskReddit,f62venl,t3_dq3uqh,1572667688.0,probably cry a bit. I had been very overweight all my childhood and told by my mom that that‚Äôs just how we are and we can‚Äôt change that. now that I‚Äôm older I‚Äôm at a healthier weight and that‚Äôs something I never saw for myself.
BPD,f5ot5ku,t1_f5osyem,1572330838.0,thank you so much!! :) I‚Äôve always been in the habit of posting my original songs on places and then immediately deleting them because I get self conscious so your comment really helped ease some of that. I‚Äôve never thought about posting music on soundcloud before but I definitely am now. Thank you again <3

I didn‚Äôt even think about that aspect but it‚Äôs true. always feeling like the little rug they get to walk on all the while preforming little tricks and jumping threw their hoops. I think it‚Äôs because we‚Äôve let them. They know what i‚Äôd allow them to do to me because I‚Äôm so starved for their love and acceptance meanwhile they‚Äôre not so they don‚Äôt care whether I‚Äôm gone or not."
