ROCD,failj4z,t3_e9eh7j,1576110768.0,"I was surprised to see this post as I’m going through the same issue right now. My bf is so kind to me and he says all this wonderful stuff to me- but so many times when I’m not talking to him though my mind starts to wander and think about his exes.  It keeps me up at night and I can’t get it out of my head no matter how hard I try.

Also, anytime he mentions them (like if they’re in a story) it makes me feel extremely threatened and I know it’s not healthy . He knows I have OCD but I’m too afraid to tell him about this because I’m worried he would feel insulted. To top it off, it’s also my first relationship (and we are long distance) so I’m always afraid I’m missing a sign or something. I look up advice on the Internet a ridiculous amount to try and help cope but everybody’s just says “get over it” and it does nothing for me.

Take this with a grain of salt, but the way I’ve been dealing with it is thinking about my own former crushes. I think to myself, “What if I had dated them and we had broken up? Wouldn’t I still love my bf now? Yes of course.” I can’t say for certain of course but putting myself in his position seems to help me a bit."

I just started college and I need to figure out what the fuck I’m supposed to be doing with my life but all I do is lay down scroll through social media. It’s fucking Hell. The worst part is recognizing it but not doing anything because I don’t have any motivation or drive anymore. Am I supposed to live the rest of my life like this?"

If I even SEE my trigger words somewhere (pretty sure ours are the same relating to health and stuff) I need to wash my hands immediately. I really wish I could get over it because it literally is getting worse and worse..."
