selfharm,fk10se2,t3_fftl3h,1583770175.0,"Hi I'm happy to help in anyway, mostly I feel miss understood with this sort of stuff.

1) I don't think it's okay but I normalised it so I thought it was okay for me to do and I didn't understand why people were so hurt by me doing it till I realised if it was someone else I'd be hurting too.

2) I realised how much it was hurting people. I didn't like cutting myself but I did it because it gave me relief and I felt like I deserved it. I also was given antidepressants which help level out how I felt so it was easier to give it up. I didn't want to have more scars. I want to go on holiday and not have to worry about people seeing my scars or fresh wounds

3) What I hated most about self harm was the stigma that people would judge me. I didn't want to be seen as weak, I wanted to be helped and people to understand. I didn't like people talking behind my back about it and having a pity party.

Hope this helps!"
