It’s one of those weird things where i’m an older kpop fan and I am a fan of bts but I really can’t be arsed with all the fan drama and this and that. I like music for the music and the production, and when I see an artist who can sing, produce, write i’m like damnnnnn...

However, i think when you said “At the end of the day, it’s just music”, this really misses the mark. I feel like that’s saying it’s not art its a scribble on the paper, it’s like assuming someone who traces a drawing and someone who creates and original masterpiece are of the same talent. 

I understand there are those idols who are not given creative freedom. But I feel like your overall view brings down and disregards those idols who do self-produce or create their own music. 

Like I said, self-producing shouldn’t be used as a belittling weapon. However, self-producing is still a great artistic achievement that we should all appreciate and advocate."

Its really unfair that other family members are using you ‘having a home’ as a way of silencing you, i’m sure if a screaming baby was to live with them the opinions would change.

Stay strong, focus on your studies, put your foot down. This is your parents child and not your responsibility.

From your perspective you took the safest option to get to the ER without incurring a huge cost. The Uber driver was clearly distressed that your accident could somehow be linked to him. 

What should have happened is that you should have alerted the driver as soon as he pulled up of the situation. Therefore, he could have then decided if it’s something he’s comfortable helping out with. However, he saw you were in a bad state, so there was no need to cuss you out and put you under more stress.

Experience - From the UK, I was having a bad allergic reaction to a medication and called 111, they told me they’d send an ambulance which I said would panic me. They suggested I called a taxi/Uber and explain my situation. I ended up getting an Uber and not having to pay the fee as the driver understood the situation and was happy to help."

It really sucks but these things happen, people stray and people lose interest. I understand how much this can hurt, I too have just come out of a 5 year relationship with what I can only describe as an emotionally abusive asshole. Know this, people are shit, people do shit things, and they won’t explain or realise what they’ve done because they want to believe they are right. Most relationships are unbalanced as there is always someone who loves the other more, and will fight more. Moving on can be hard but sometimes you just have to accept that what happened happened and you wont know why it happened to you because that’s life. I’m sorry that seems harsh, but it is and it sucks but all you can do is learn from it, learn what you need and want in a relationship and never settle for anything less.

linguistics,eyjmvmk,t3_cx8r77,1567122839.0,"I think in order to reach full “native speaker” fluency you definitely need near constant exposure of the language in order for your brain to properly adapt to the natural functions of “automatic” language processing and production. However, in terms of accent I personally think this aspect needs more conscious work in order to acquire “native speaker” fluency. If you’re just wanting to have the automatic brain processing, I honestly suggest multiple hours each day of exposure or ideally living in the languages native country if possible. There’s not really any telling on a time limit as each and every person has a different “capacity” for acquiring language. If I had to suggest a time frame and you have already suggested that you are very proficient in these languages, I would say a year or two may get you to “native speaker” fluency. 

This all depends of course, on motivation, exposure, and other effects such as your comprehension of the grammar and the overall intuitive understanding you have of each language as certain languages will be easier to acquire depending on how you learn and your own first language. Hope this was of some help!"

I’m so sorry that you ex-SO put you through this and that it’s had that much of a catastrophic effect on your health and life.. if you can take any happiness from it though, know that this has really opened my eyes as to what I shouldn’t allow myself to think.

Honestly hoping you’re moving towards being better and okay, thank you for sharing."

I think this comment really hit the nail on the head, I feel like what you’ve said is exactly what we both needed. We sat and had a long conversation and we both came to agreement that we both need to try more altogether, as I was used to him being quite absent in my life but I don’t think not seeing each other for 3 weeks (for no reason) really helps the relationship as well as me not putting effort into our online / texting communication - so we have both agreed to sort this out.

We also discussed how i’d suggest more if he’d be willing to say yes to more things, this will probably be harder for us both immediately as neither of us have jobs so money is a problem at the moment but we will work on this none the less.  

I think when we had our first big discussion about it all he was just throwing things around without thinking about it properly as in our recent conversation he’s said things much more clearly and gone into detail about all the things he said about me before rather than just saying statements about my whole person.

Thank you for taking your time to give me advice it was really appreciated and I even showed my bf this post so that we could both see outside perspectives and find a way to work it out as we both clearly want to be together."
relationship_advice,ew6iyn8,t1_evy0dcr,1565171833.0,"Thanks for taking the time to reply ~ sorry for the delayed response

We sat and spoke about it all and we’ve both agreed to try and sort the relationship out as ultimately that’s what we both want, he’s said that he may have been feeling this was as he is also unemployed at the moment (I should have probably mentioned that). This could also be a factor and we’ve agreed that we want it to work and that we do really like each other, so I guess from here out we both need to put the effort in as well as me trying to better myself for myself. Thanks for your response it helped clarify things and help me look at myself and the relationship logically."
