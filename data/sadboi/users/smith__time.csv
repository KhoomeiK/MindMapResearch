BipolarReddit,fr1ldyq,t3_glzmq0,1589821745.0,I felt similar. I was at 150mg and it seemed to be the most stable I‚Äôd been.  I started noticing I was sleeping less half the time and I was hypomanic on and off though. I talked to my prescriber and he upped my dose to 200mg. So far it has been even more stable. if it were me (and It was) I‚Äôd make an appointment because maybe the medication isn‚Äôt right or maybe the dose isn‚Äôt.

BipolarReddit,fmz1m4c,t3_fyajhh,1586502993.0,I‚Äôm wondering if your dose could be too high or maybe it‚Äôs just not the right medicine for you. I take it and it‚Äôs been amazing to support my stability. For a while I was still hypomanic so my prescriber increased my dose and now my brain is more happy but I still have a range of emotions. Some days I still feel really high or low. I told my therapist because I thought maybe I‚Äôd need another increase and she said ‚Äúwe still want you to feel‚Äù and an increase could mean numbness.

bipolar,fja41u5,t1_fj99dzg,1583165940.0,"Honestly, I understand that.  I felt like that most of my life.. I like to take a very holistic approach to things. I never saw myself as someone to take meds for a mental health issue if i ever had one. Then a LOT happened.. and I've learned it's safe to welcome the extra support. 

I've been more stable since this med combo than I have my whole teenage\\adult life so far. I've lived with un-diagnosed bipolar since I was a teen and  I was made aware of it not even a year ago. While they really help, meds are just a small piece of the puzzle. I have an amazing support group of family and friends, amazing therapist, and practicing lots of self care and healthy habits. 

Wishing you all the best in whatever treatment you chose that works best for you!!!"
