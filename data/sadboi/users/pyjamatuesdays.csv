If I was healthier I’d be able to own my choices more, but I can’t help but worry when I think of what my friends and family might think. I guess this is the time to work on bypassing those thoughts and focussing on action. The thing that’s been hardest for me!

findapath,fjf7nqi,t3_fctkv9,1583286035.0,"Holy goodness your skill set totally sets you up to be a killer content creator!!! Have you considered looking for social media management opportunities? So many organizations benefit from active posting that doesn’t require specific training, just online intuition and a willingness to set high standards for what you post on their behalf. Additionally, all kinds of organizations could use this - you could even volunteer for a non profit for a few months to get the hang out it and develop some experience!

Also, sites like skill share or hubspot are awesome for social media marketing know-how that could come in handy. 

And the best thing about creative work is your portfolio means as much as your education! So even if you don’t have time to invest in an unpaid gig, searching for entry level opportunities with your graphics and photography samples will go a long way. 

This is the field I work in but my work experience is limited, so I have a large section of my resume dedicated to listing my technical skills, listed in categories. It looks really nice even though my relevant work experience listings are limited.

Yeah you’re right on the depression front. It’s been this way for a while but your comment reminds me that when my meds changed so did my perspective so maybe I can also use my depression as a motivator to help myself. 
Like up to now I’ve been so hard on myself for just being lazy and slow but there’s a lot of grace that comes with accepting there’s something happening to you that you can’t control, but you can work with. 
Also the digging deeper thing is good advice, I was just thinking about the “go down the rabbit hole” idea because if I let myself get fascinated and excited then I can actually totally lose myself in the thing that’s interesting. 
Thanks for your validation and ideas, friend"

As a person who often feels like “too much” socially, the best gift I ever gave myself was building friendships super slowly. No need to get someone’s digits or promise a future hangout when you vibe with them at a mutual’s party, just enjoy the connection and remind yourself that the opportunity to include them in your life won’t truly present itself until you see them in a few more contexts anyways. There is no rush! I always have to remind myself this"

DAE,ffrdadz,t3_eumamp,1580155698.0,"I attribute this to my ADHD and anxiety, and the way I can best explain it, and kinda work with it, is to look at it this way: 

My brain is lost in space, it has no idea who I am or where I am or what’s up until I remind it (an over statement, sure, but it gives me permission to feel completely boggled by my perspective without shame). So when I’m “checking in” on the world around me and feel frightened, I remind myself that it’s my brain just trying to reorient itself. It wants to know we are safe and healthy and have dealt with all the things I need to deal with. 

Then I developed a bit of a checklist. My requirements for being human. Turns out they are pretty minimal: look after yourself well enough so you can be your best self out in the world. At the bare minimum, if you have a financial plan, a planned way to put food and water in your body, and no outstanding promises to fulfil, you are free. Everything else I want to be or do or prove is EXTRA. So I’m that moment where I feel lost and like I have missed something, I remind myself that it’s ok if I did because I’m human, and my only job is to develop systems for myself that allow me to be relaxed and feel in charge of my own time, so that I can honestly own up to is when something does slip through the cracks"
