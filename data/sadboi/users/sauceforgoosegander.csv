You've been ready ~~ for quite some time to step up & live your life ~~ your way. I believe you may be a sensitive soul. Always remember, no one can take advantage of you, unless you let them. Keep healthy boundaries. Stay true to yourself. Always be yourself. Make sure to take the time to heal from old wounds, to have fun with friends & family, and don't be afraid to do things on your own. I loved visiting the museums, libraries & the theaters for musicals & plays. I even loved taking in a movie on my own. You found your confidence & independence. Go be the best you can be. I wish you joy & happiness."

Initially, and for quite some time, I would feel worse after a handful of sessions with my therapist. At times, I still do. I found it difficult to talk about my trauma. I'm glad I found this sub Reddit, and others like it. It helped me realize I'm not alone."
