I AM BIPOLAR. Bipolar a quality, a condition, not separable from the rest of the person that contains it.

bipolar,fmh6z11,t3_fv7eyf,1586068812.0,"For reasons still unknown, the first psychiatrist I saw after diagnosis gave me abilify, which has got to be the most misnamed drug on the market.  The only ability I had was to drag myself to a shitty parttime job and to turn on the tv and lie on the couch.  I remember telling my friends that the cost of treating the bipolar was to delete my personality.  For over a year I didn't listen to a song or read a book or possibly even formulate an opinion.

Then I switched medications, to good ol' lithium, and that started to change.  So my point it: you could speak to your doctor and see if there are some other options for treating you.  There's a galaxy of antipsychotics out there and perhaps one would give you more manageable side effects. 

So maybe dont plan for this to be the status quo until retirement, and focus on as little of the future as possible.  If, in 6 months, you still cant play guitar or snowboard or whatever, then you could speak to your doctor about it.  Hope this helps, you're medicated and it sounds to me like you are doing really well so far."

I was heavily medicated and I dont remember much but I do remember an intense emotion when they explained to a (no longer manic) me that I had bipolar.  I don't name the emotion, because I'm not sure what to call it.  it was a combination of the feeling of relief when a wiggly baby tooth falls out and also the terror of probing the empty space after you have a tooth knocked out. either way, it explained soooo muuuuch about my (very unstable) life up to that point.

Its good to be diagnosed OP, and its better that you keep taking the lithium. This may become difficult as it's easy to convince yourself (especially after that initial diagnosis) that you're ""feeling fine"" and maybe youll even start to think that you dont have bipolar at all, that it was some kind of mixup at the hospital.
