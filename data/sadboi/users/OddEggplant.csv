She also told her mom (she wanted her to file a police report at the time), but the mom passed away. When they interviewed staff in the office they said they never heard of anything like that happening (but why would they know, it happened in private). So it does come down to ""he said, she said"" but we know she was working there at the time, two people confirmed she told them after it happened, she apparently filed a sexual harassment claim with the Senate HR, but Joe Biden's Senate papers were donated and are currently sealed at the University of Deleware. Here is my source. This is an interview with Rich Mchough who directly investigated Tara's claims and broke the story with Weinstein's accusers. 

Also, the statute of limitations has expired on the crime, so no charges can be brought against Biden in a court of law, which means no testimony under oath. A great example of how the justice system has failed survivors. So, unfortunately, this is going to be a ""public trial"".

After writing lots of angry stuff, I have finally sat down and focused on what needs to be done to hold Biden accountable. And I have two demands 

1. Have an interview with Joe Biden and Tara Reade addressing these allegations on national television.
2. Joe Biden unseals and gives the public access to the senate papers."

I‚Äôm writing letters to the DNC and major Democrat politicians. I wish I could contact AOC because I think she would be willing to stand with us on our demands. She even shared with CBS that she thinks we should take these allegations seriously. But I think a lot of Progressives are walking on egg shells around the DNC at the moment. It is emotionally exhausting being called a Russian asset and/or trump troll at least 10x a day.

1.unseal the senate papers
2. And a national television interview where Joe Biden and Tara Reade can share their side of the story. 

Also I want to stress these accusations are not coming from a political agenda. While I am a Bernie supporter, I am willing to vote for a moderate (so as long as they don‚Äôt have allegations like these).

I‚Äôm hoping that if this spreads enough that the DNC will realize that they are being forced by the public to do that interview, they know it will be political suicide, and will choose someone else who has less political liability issues.

I‚Äôll link his interview below. The people who ended up writing the articles in the Nation/NYT were misleading. For example, the document that Tara filled out a sexual harassment complaint with the senate against Biden in 1993, it‚Äôs not gone, it‚Äôs being sealed so no one can access it. The media is really trying to discredit this woman. And if you knew anything about rape survivors is that yeah maybe she came forward with sexual harassment allegations, but didn‚Äôt talk about being raped.
But that‚Äôs because saying something like that will tarnish your name forever and at the time she may have not been ready for that. I get that, I left horrific details out when I reported. I ask that you listen straight from the person who investigated it. He worked with the Weinstein survivors and has experience in how survivors may react in these stressful situations.

[NYT Joe Biden Allegations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html?fbclid=IwAR2JFMAqryYUp_JuzIDeSUrL4TYIe6Ea-srFKnNb57VheJE-UiQ_ZCbGb-o)
rapecounseling,fnhhk1n,t1_fnhcxlw,1586962530.0,"But here is the thing, RAPE ACCUSATIONS ARE NOT POLITICAL. And if we do want to to talk politics, the DNC does not have to run this candidate. In fact there are many people just as qualified, possibly even more qualified to be the nominee. He is a huge political liability. If any other candidate had these kind of skeletons in their closet they wouldn‚Äôt have a political career. But because he was VP and has name recognition and power in the party he‚Äôs the exception. And what you and the DNC must understand is that you are more likely to win if you choose a candidate that people are excited to go out and vote for, rather than shame and guilt people into voting for someone they don‚Äôt believe in. We saw it in 2016 and it didn‚Äôt work out so great. This will just be an even worse repeat of last time. Democrats need to stop with the campaign slogan ‚ÄúWell at least I‚Äôm better than that guy‚Äù ‚ÄúWell he has more sexual assault allegations than me‚Äù It seems absurd and I don‚Äôt understand why this is so ‚Äúradical‚Äù."
rapecounseling,fnhgmqx,t1_fnhctsq,1586962034.0,"I hear what you are saying. Because as we know many of these cases turn out to be ‚Äúhe said, she said‚Äù there is definitely not going to be a definitive answer. And the people who ‚Äúinvestigated‚Äù were from the NYT, which is a pretty bias sourced of news. I think what this petition is asking for is a real investigation by a third party, possibly a detective from the police. Also when they interviewed seven women in the office she was working in at the time, they also claimed he was inappropriate with them (not rape), and said they believed Tara. Even though Tara is the only one accusing him of rape, the fact that he has this long history of women saying that he touched them inappropriately and made them feel uncomfortable. Lucy Flores is an example. And like I said we don‚Äôt have evidence, but patterns speak loud. And there is definitely a pattern, and it makes me lean towards believing Tara. 

And while this may not work, I am taking this time in quarantine to write to major Democrat politicians and the DNC to voice my concerns and call for action. I think the petition is about raising awareness through social media."

ptsd,fnfdl08,t3_g1bnzc,1586906038.0,"You are definitely not alone. And you don‚Äôt need to feel shame. If you feel safe and your getting consent with your partners then you do you. I have experienced this on and off. After coming to terms with what happened, I was celibate for a year, and then after I was super hyper sexual. I was sleeping with men off tinder I wasn‚Äôt even attracted to and sometimes scared me. After going through therapy I have figured out that was how I coped with my PTSD because it made me feel so out of control (especially when I finally reported) and I wanted to show men and everyone I had control. And unfortunately recently that led to being assaulted again at an attempt to show this guy, who tried to inappropriately make a move on me, that I had control by making out with another guy in front of him. But then that guy wanted more and you probably know how that story goes. 

So here‚Äôs the thing hypersexuality isn‚Äôt always a bad thing. It can be a liberating experience for some that helps them heal. But for me it was a dangerous and unhealthy coping mechanism that made me feel used up by the end. So I think you might want to reflect on whether your hyper sexuality is bringing happiness and positivity to your life or if it‚Äôs just bringing more chaos."
rape,fn5snmv,t3_fzpgm3,1586674516.0,It is rape. Just because it was another child does not negate the fact that she penetrated her finger in you. Your feelings are valid.

rapecounseling,fmvbexq,t1_fmvatan,1586411405.0,Also writing letters to the DNC. Maybe even prominent Democratic politicians. Especially women. Also just making a scene on social media. YouTube videos.
rapecounseling,fmvb9y5,t1_fmvatan,1586411287.0,What we need to convey to the DNC is that if they run Biden people aren‚Äôt going to vote for him. So I‚Äôm almost thinking a petition. You can make one online. Get a petition of people who are saying I‚Äôm not voting for a rapist. Because if the DNC knows they are going to lose significant votes in the general they won‚Äôt run Biden because of liability issues. And they will likely choose another centrist candidate at the convention.
rapecounseling,fmv6tos,t1_fmv5unh,1586407625.0,"We get on social media and make a scene. Write letters to the DNC. Get loud!

rapecounseling,fmv5mtu,t1_fmv4elv,1586406718.0,"I think democrats need to demand that the DNC choose someone else at the Democratic Convention, because I do believe that Joe Biden won‚Äôt have all the delegates to win the nominee automatically.

I heard her describe her experience and you can just hear every little weird detail not related to the assault that many survivors will focus on to dissociate during the assault. And just hearing her speak about it, it just sounds sincere and realistic. Also, I know it sounds weird but I can look at a man and know if he is a predator.I have this instinct and I can just feel it in my gut that Biden is a disgusting predator."
rape,fmu3hxz,t1_fmu1z7q,1586383883.0,"But that‚Äôs the thing it‚Äôs not political. It‚Äôs a survivor coming forward. Just like we support on this thread. I‚Äôm a survivor and I‚Äôm expressing anger over this. How is that political? It sounds like an excuse.

Edit: Also I‚Äôve seen threads talking about Weinstein, Kobe Bryant, Kavanaugh accusations, why is this any different?"

traumatoolbox,flrkmwd,t3_fqgdkp,1585422154.0,"I can relate to this so much. I imagine a partner (a crush who I want to be my partner) holding me and I even voice the validating words they would say. When you go through trauma you literally reach for anything that is there and it‚Äôs better than many other coping skills like substance abuse or disordered eating. To make myself feel less ‚Äúout there‚Äù I remind myself I‚Äôm a little crazy and weird, because I went through a lot of fucked up stuff and it‚Äôs a totally normal reaction to an abnormal situation."

ptsd,fkujw9b,t3_fko9ky,1584550768.0,I've had the same problem. Personally I struggle with memory and concentration which kind of makes me look ditzy and stupid. But my therapist and psychiatrist have told me those are symptoms of PTSD. So just know it's not you and you are doing the best you can.
LesbianDating,fksf28g,t3_fk2hta,1584488624.0,"If there is anything I have learned over these past few years with dating women is if they are into you, you will know. They will be mutually asking you to go out, they will want to make a move (it‚Äôs not just your responsibility) and text you and check in with you especially during this very scary moment. I even texted a woman I just have a crush on to check in with her. But you are right, it could just be the pandemic. She could be scared and trying to find a way to cope with all this and maybe doesn‚Äôt want you to see her vulnerable side. But I think the best thing to do would be text her, be up-front, ask her how she‚Äôs doing first, and then ask if she still wants to date. Unfortunately dating during this time is going to be tricky with the whole ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù but there is always Skype."

PTSD will make you want to minimize the situation which unfortunately overlaps in how you see/express opinion of others stories.
