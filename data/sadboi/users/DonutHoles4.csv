Leo is hot and famous and a rich actor. 

Jay z is a famous musician and has money.  Also his street smarts and social skills are also probably pretty damn good, for example. He probably also has a lot of connections. 

Most likely anyways.

You’re only seeing it from the women’s side of things.

As a guy if you even want to be on a lot of women’s radar, you better have a lot going for you.

Or you need to be pretty good looking. 

If you’re good looking with nothing else going for you, a women may date you for a time but eventually she’ll lose respect and move on. 

Perhaps not, but it’s very likely."
BodyDysmorphia,fmw5qtg,t1_fmw4zcx,1586440131.0,"—-“ Being a girl is NOT enough for a guy to date her”

Of course.

But the sword swings both ways. 

Yes, as a girl, attractiveness plays a big role. If you’re hot, you’ll literally have tons of guys into you. 

At the same time tho, for most guys, you need to have a lot going for you. 

You don’t need to be famous, or rich, or be confident, or have high social status if you’re a girl. 

Those are all things that a lot of women look for in men. Hence, my comment about many women having high standards. 

Women are held to beauty standards. But they aren’t held to a lot of standards that men are. 

Example:  You don’t need to have high social status if you’re a girl, dating wise. But as a guy social status is a big factor in how women size you up when it comes to dating. 


——-“There was no need at any point to take a dismissive/condescending tone”

I was just stating my opinion. 

You are reading in too much. 

I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say that you are the one being dismissive.

You’re projecting. 

Your mindset and experience of what you look for in men is not necessarily how a lot of women act regarding these things. Many women have high standards and an overinflated sense of their market value because women get chased a lot more often then men do. 


——-“Who gives you the authority to make such a statement psychoanalyzing women’s behavior?”

There’s no such thing as authority in this case. I’m speaking from experience. 

Granted, my experiences can definitely be biased based on ones own individual experiences. 


——-“I’m  sorry that youve been hurt before. 

Somewhere among the lines some girl(s) have given you the attitude and cynicism you’re displaying now, and that saddens me. I know what it’s like to have faced rejection and felt insecure.”

Lol how do you even know that’s true? You don’t know me. 

You’re making a lot of assumptions here.

And again, you are projecting. 

—-anyways Sorry.  You’re right that this subreddit isn’t the place for this type of discussion."
BodyDysmorphia,fmw2jhf,t1_fmw1h4q,1586438027.0,"——-Same ballpark tho.

Also, different types of guys like different types of girls. 

As a guy, you still need to have a lot going for you. Like you need to have at least some confidence or most girls won’t respect you. 

That’s not something every guy can easily do. 

For many girls, just existing is enough for a guy to want to date you. You don’t have to be confident. In general it’s easier for girls to get dates and kisses and sex. 

That’s not true for all girls but it’s true for a lot. 

Women are super judgmental and judge guys for not being some perfect prince who’s totally flawless. 

Some of them, anyways. 

Feel free to disagree. 


-

——“  I’ve talked many times to other girls about how while a “hot” body is nice, it doesn’t really matter ”

Lol. You know actions speak louder than words right? 

Sometimes what women say they find attractive is just their default response they tell people. It’s not necessarily the truth. 

Guys do it too. 

Also, Many women don’t respect guys if they don’t even have a minimum amount of confidence. Even if the guy was hot and they dated the guy, at some point they would lose respect for him and dump him, in that case. 

Appearance matters a lot as a girl but honestly as an average guy you usually need to have a lot more going for you than just “I’m kind of handsome”.

Feel free to disagree."
