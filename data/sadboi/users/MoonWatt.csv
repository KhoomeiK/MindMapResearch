All these just says if you are in the job market not only is the pool getting wider, chances are no company will be operating at full capacity for a very long time.

I have been angry at the disease for years, but letting psychiatrist push meds that hurt me more that harm me made me feel powerless, hopeless and very angry.

Oh, I wish I could express how mush I get what you are saying. The shame, the uselessness that you feel. I was Close to day time drinking when I said to hell with it. I will make my treating physicians understand that their proposed treatments are making me worse. I go back on the 30th, because ADHD meds are highly regulated in my country, but I promised myself to advocate for my well being from now on. I will fight to stay on my current treatment until I feel it doesn‚Äôt work, then I will ask for something else. It‚Äôs been over 10 years of misery, I think I even started accElgin g feeling like crap all the time until I felt suicidal thoughts start to creep in.

Please, please sit down and try and remember the last time you felt happy or functional and then remind yourself that you deserve to be okay. We are not guinea pigs. Then  and question your treating physician if there is absolutely nothing they can do for you. In my worst moments I even suspected my psychiatrists of only caring about how often she can get me to come back only to tell me to be patient with meds that were making my problems worse.

You sound like a great mom but that doesn‚Äôt mean you get to have a say how others go about mothering unless they are abusing their children. I felt the need to say that because you have quite a bit to say about how she is mothering.

It sounds like you are not ready to go full No contact, have you tried grey rocking? It does sound like you maybe dealing with parasitic family members That you need to set proper boundaries for. And if she is really a a Narcissist, please don‚Äòt give in to the temptation to reach out."

When I first joined the industry there were still too many directors who were not necessarily qualified but believed in working to a point that they refused to acknowledge new easier methods. We‚Äôd be accused of being lazy, wanting to cut corners. Refusing to work 12 hour days for weeks on end was perceived as lacking work ethic but no matter how much you wanted to implement effecient ways so we could cut hours, they would accuse you of trying to make them redundant. They would come to work sick and make everyone sick.

We have seen it in laws (wars against drugs) that didn‚Äôt want to address human suffering but was quick to over punish. Medicine only recently acknowledging mental illnesses. Our parents generatio messed up and some Of us instead of questioning we add to the problem. I hear in China and Japan some people sleep at work and they won‚Äôt recognise mental illness yet their suicide rates are abnormal.

Anti anxiety meds on the other hand For me, work like magic. Although I don‚Äôt have general anxiety but if I don‚Äôt sleep for two days for instance an anti anxiety will calm me and I will sleep.   


My doctor and I are now exploring ADHD meds (she also wants to evaluate). She still prescribed Maridep (she asked me to give it a try because it has very few side effects). People say they (ADHD meds) make them high etc. For me they just remove brain fog and I don‚Äôt get overwhelmed so I get a lot done.   


I don't know if it‚Äôs finally standing up to my treating physicians and telling them antibiotics make me more sick and useless or it‚Äôs the ADHD meds but I haven‚Äôt felt this normal in over a decade.

Sleep during the day and don‚Äôt feel guilty letting her watch as much tv as will keep her busy while you rest.

This is the absolute worst time for any of us to want to be perfect moms/Employee. Awe are on survival mode. I have set an appt to sit and talk to my son each day, help him with homework. The rest of the time is sleep , tv and games for him and work for me. I will not feel guilty."

And Narcs are very good at making their victims sound, look and feel crazy so you may want to use the anonymity of the web where we all speak openly. Just be careful of potential Narcs posing as victims. They are notorious for posing in this online groups and for posing as victims just to lure more victims. LOL"
