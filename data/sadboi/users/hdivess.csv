AskWomen,fqpkjkj,t3_gk2rxw,1589548555.0,"Hahahahahaha!! Well!! Funny that you asked! I knew this guy is high school, mainly senior year. We flirted a bit but I had a boyfriend and he had a girlfriend. I got his number and we became friends since that’s all we could be. A month or so after we graduated my boyfriend at the time proposed and I had said yes because I was young and dumb but that didn’t last long. I ended things a few months later and then started talking to another guy but in the meantime the guy from high-school asked me out on a few dates. The dates were okay, we never kissed or anything. We just went to the movies and chick fil a because again we were young, dumb, and complete assholes. It would have never worked. 


So, the other guy I was talking to asked me out and we started dating. Dated for 4 years, got engaged, we were 2 weeks away from getting married when I realized that it wasn’t right. My gut was telling me that this wasn’t right and he wasn’t for me. I called off the wedding, we broke up and I started to learn how to be single. I have always been the type to be in a relationship. I jump from one to another and I always end up diving head first. So being single and alone was really hard for me. 


Luckily, this happened to be around summer so I was single for the summer and obviously able to drink. I lived life to the fullest and just went wild because I had never been allowed to! I had some flings (nothing sexual) just some casual dates and whatnot. I was obviously on tinder and just having fun. Then out of nowhere this guy from high school pops up.


I had made a new Instagram and was adding people back on this one. We had each other added for a while but I had noticed him starting to watch my stories more and more. I was doing that thing where people can ask you questions and he asked me “what is your guilty pleasure song”. So I answered him on Instagram, for those wondering it’s “What’s makes you beautiful” by One Direction! It’s a banger, okay?! Don’t judge! Once I answered him, I got a text from him! 


Fast forward to now we have been dating for 8 months and it’s been going pretty well. Almost 6 years without saying one word to each other and it’s like we picked up where we left off. Never thought I’d talk to him again and I definitely never thought I’d be dating him but a part of me always wondered where he was. So that’s how I re-met my boyfriend."
AskWomen,fqphl5s,t3_gjlqos,1589546590.0,"Worst experience was probably when I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I was in the 6th grade and I had suicidal thoughts almost every day. I didn’t know what it was, all I knew was that I did not want to be here anymore. I was bullied and barely had any friends. I didn’t have anyone to talk to. I didn’t want to tell my parents because they always said I was too sensitive. My mom was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago but back then we didn’t know. We just thought she was really mean. So anyway, I had made a plan to lull myself. Whether I was really going to do it, I’m not sure. I was in 6th grade. But I had told a “friend” about it and she told someone else. It ended up getting around the school and I was called out of class in front of everyone. The counselor took me out of class to talk to me while the principal called my mom. I had no clue what was going on. We went downstairs and talked while waiting for my mom. When my mom got there she took me to this therapists office where I was evaluated. There’s this school where I live that is for troubled youth and they were seeing if I would be better off there. I told the therapist that I didn’t actually want to kill myself, that I didn’t know why I said those things. They diagnosed me with anxiety and depression and I’ve lived with it since then. I have good days and bad days. Good years and horrible years. I feel like it’s getting worse as I’m getting older. I don’t have suicidal thoughts anymore. I do have periods of time where I feel so low and completely lazy and then I have other times when I am the most outgoing person ever. It’s the worst. I wish I could just be outgoing and motivated all the time."

We had went to the same school growing up but we didn’t interact until senior year. We became pretty good friends and then the feelings started to flow but we were in relationships. We still flirted a little but it never went anywhere until after we graduated high school. Fast forward to 7 months after graduation, we both had broken up with our SO’s and it was right before Valentine’s Day. We went on 3 dates but I was stupid and already hung up on some other guy. It was my fault really that we didn’t get together sooner but looking back we were both young, stupid, and complete assholes. Timing was all wrong. 


5 almost 6 years later, our lines crossed again. At this point in time I had been engaged twice and almost married while he had his fair share of relationships. He reached out to me this past September and we met up for drinks. 5 years of not talking or seeing each other whatsoever. Not even on social media because I had made a new account and didn’t follow him. Anyway, we met up for drinks and the spark was still there. We made a pact that if we are not married by 35 that we will go to Vegas and get married."

Contraception is both parties!

It is a conversation that must be had. It’s super awkward, or at least I can be but important nonetheless. 


If he decides he doesn’t want to wear a condom and you’re okay with going on BC, great! If you want him to wear a condom because you don’t want to go on BC and he’s okay with that, awesome! If neither of you can agree then sex shouldn’t be had."
