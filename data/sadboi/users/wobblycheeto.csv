AskReddit,fnj26p5,t3_g1u0ex,1586990571.0,"We had a lady who came in SCREAMING at our manager because she was shocked that we charged her $15 for a bucket of draft Amber Bock beer (which is a craft beer). She was even wanting to take away the server’s tip and was demanding a full refund on her $150 bar tab. 

She then demanded to see the bar menu which I kindly gave to her and she goes “See?! $9.50 for a BUCKET.” 

I then reply, “Ma’am, that is for a PINT glass.” 

She then claims it’s false advertising and then proceeded to call all of us dumb bitches and left with a “refund” of $9.

It’s safe to say that we don’t sell buckets of beer anymore."

insaneparents,fjhvjnl,t1_fjhv5qt,1583355844.0,The therapy revolves around her invalidating my mental health all throughout my life and not taking my mental health seriously. I’ve always kept my problems to myself because she never takes in consideration on how her comments effect me. This isn’t her being “money cautious” it’s her way of saying “what a waste of money”.
insaneparents,fjhtez6,t3_fcdpyz,1583354732.0,The same thing happened to me when I was younger! My dad ended up hacking my account on a chat platform and disabling it for 3000 days which is roughly 8 years. I’m 20 and live on my own and it’s still disabled. I feel your pain 100%
insaneparents,fjhrhl8,t1_fjhr6v4,1583353723.0,I even thought the same thing until I started going. It’s really life changing and I wish all generations could realize that it benefits everyone.

Anxiety,fb3llmt,t1_fb3ldvr,1576477551.0,"Yes I completely understand!! In my mind, it’s wild concept that someone actually want to hang out with me. I’m so glad we aren’t alone in this because sometimes it definitely feels that way. It’s so weird because I’m confident in myself I just can’t wrap my head around the fact my friends are genuine. I also don’t have advice BUT just know that your feelings are valid and I completely understand where you’re coming from."

athiesm,falfe40,t3_e9s8fh,1576183454.0,"I always thought “speaking in tongue” was some kind of satanic ritual thing, but after looking it up and skimming some bible verses (1 Corinthians 14:14) I’ve read that speaking in tongue is actually a form of prayer that is often mistaken for something satanic. I may be wrong so correct me if I am! That info is just what I got from reading a few articles.
