forhonor,fp8zgw8,t1_fp7rdn7,1588408532.0,"Remember that For Honor is in a low fantasy setting. This kind of thing is expected for that style of game, and with all the magic added later on, it's obvious the devs intended on representing a less than plausible world. Imo I prefer realistic swords and spears, but tbh Hitokiri has a cool design, and having her wield such a massive double-axe makes you wonder how human she even is. Is she a demon from hell, or some kind of wraith-like creature? Or has she performed some dark ritual in which she *does* actually claim the souls of those she slaughters, strengthening her at the cost of her own humanity? These are the kinds of questions you can pose in a low fantasy setting without breaking the suspension of disbelief, because some weapons are oversized for human use. If For Honor was intended to be realistic, or historical, then designing weapons too big for a human to wield would be sloppy, immersion breaking art direction. This is not the case, however, and the mythic size of these weapons really lends credence to that frission inducing line in the cinematic trailer: You play as one of the ""greatest warriors the world has *ever* known"". That line alone made me buy the game all those years ago, because I want to play games where I can feel fucking legendary."
forhonor,fp8yeze,t1_fp7ahzh,1588407423.0,">buff warden

Lol, please no. That being said, it would be really cool if every character had a sort of OS or Qi stance. Could help balance the game by increasing everyone's moveset. You could standardize kit while offering each character unique toolsets that, while powerful, are locked behind a hidden stance/full block stance/Qi/offense form type move. Basically, the longer two people remain in neutral trying to land a hit, the more complex and dynamic the fights become. Plus it would halfway solve the issue of characters like Nobushi being annihilated by Wardens, for example, because they simply don't have access to the tools a character like Warden, Lawbringer, or Hitokiri can have at their disposal rather quickly and safely."
