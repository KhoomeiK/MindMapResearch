I have to say I think the same. Never had the patience to dig to deep into what Nawaz has since said. 
Thank you for your thoughts"
AskReddit,fh3vpey,t3_f18upu,1581272748.0,"I can’t imagine what my parents would go through after all they’ve already done for me. Same with people I *think* will be devastated if I do. I just want to let them know that I am not worth it. I don’t know how, but killing certainly won’t help.
Also there’s this extremely irrational part of me that believes good things are around the corner, no matter what the overwhelming present evidence suggests. The good news is that is slowly thinning away as I get older. The more I look back, the life that I’ve missed. The opportunities not taken, only a few more to realize what a piece of shit I am.
Yea so that."

AskReddit,erkmo42,t1_erk5baj,1560966789.0,"This is an oversimplification. The unification force behind the freedom movement was Gandhi. Practically all freedom fighters revered him and if it weren’t for him, could have possibly not come together. 
Also the stuff about Gandhi being racist is one of the few nitpicks you hear about him from people that want to undermine his legacy (they have a twisted motivation to do so,  but now is not the time). He himself admits that he made mistakes, and has grown as an individual because of it. I myself have an ambivalent opinion on him, because of his spotted personal life. But his contribution to the freedom movement can not be undermined in any way."

depression,eq2v11h,t1_epyb8ro,1559744541.0,"Guilt tripping for what exactly? I don’t have any incentive to make a person feel worse than he already does, given I’ve gone through something similar myself. Even though I don’t know what he is going through, I know he isn’t special. And not in a bad kind of way. I believe other people are humans too, and when it comes to it are as good/bad as you. And when someone loves you, you best believe they love you inspite of your imperfections. The very same that make you hate yourself.
And this only when they have loved ones, not if they’ve been treated badly by their closest relatives. 
I don’t believe it reinforces their belief to do it even more. Because I feel there is goodness in people that let them believe that they might want to do the right thing ."
depression,epy3wjh,t1_epxh7so,1559618594.0,"Man I don’t want to me that guy. But I’ve been through this, literally dozens of times.
Sat on railings from sixth floor of a high rise building on a rainy night, when it’s just slippery enough. No matter what you say about yourself or how unhappy you are, you must realize that by killing your self you are being incredibly selfish. I got my own problems too man, but convincing myself that my loved ones just got to deal with my death is not right. They see so much more in you than you do. You must accept that fact. Depression and unhappiness is an abnormal state, just like when you’re sick. And no amount of reasoning can diminish another persons love for you. To say that you are dealing with your own unhappiness is somehow reason for them to be unhappy is selfish .
I get it, I’m depressed half of the time, but killing yourself  and convincing your loved ones should deal with it is not a sign of sadness. It is one of cruelty and selfishness"
