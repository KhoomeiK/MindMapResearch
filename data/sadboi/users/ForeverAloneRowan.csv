blackfishing,fr37z1y,t1_fr2vdng,1589851783.0,"I don‚Äôt think you understand how Reddit works...

r/blackfishing isn‚Äôt a witch hunt, which is what you appear to be doing, but rather for commentary and discussion around the topic itself. This subreddit isn‚Äôt for exposing the individuals who participate in blackfishing - it is here to expose blackfishing itself as a problem by providing examples/pictures.

SuicideWatch,fkr6sal,t1_fkr4g3o,1584462952.0,"If you did not have a self to care for, you would not feel despair upon feeling that you have lost that self. It is not over for you. You have the capacity to realize you have hurt others, and it is clearly frustrating or upsetting you. Even if you are perhaps a narcissist you are not too far gone. 

Do not latch onto this self fulfilling prophecy. You need to fight this idea that you are inherently worthless and bad, and that these downfalls are not changeable. You are incredibly self-aware and accepting that you may often be the one in the wrong. That is very uncommon for narcissists. Usually they are very much in denial that they could ever be wrong or bad. 

I think you are struggling with your position in life and the way in which you respond to and treat others, which I promise you, is normal. I thought I was a sociopath at one point in my life but I realized I was latching onto something that confirmed my pre-existing self-hatred and feelings of worthlessness and lack of value in this world.

The rental agreement does not include any clear description of allocation and the only thing it really has regarding water in the lease is ""The tenant is responsible for all utilities."" I also found ""Texas law does not allow property owners to profit from allocated billing by adding extra fees or hidden charges to water and wastewater bills."" When I spoke to her on the phone, I said that I believed they were overcharging for more than what the city charges for water/sewage, and she said ""We are..."" and proceeded to explain that they charge more than just the base water fee, though I didn't get a clear explanation as to how or why."

college,f7c1l77,t3_dva97m,1573582397.0,"So this may be more along the lines of study tips. Once weekly, usually on Sunday, I grab a coffee, go to YouTube and turn on my playlist of study with me pomodoros (25 minute study sessions with 5 minute breaks in between) with music. 

Then, I start writing down my notes from the week. For stuff that I really need to memorize, after I write it down I‚Äôll turn around and try to rewrite it as many times as it takes for me to memorize. 

Also it sounds crazy but after you write down your notes or read them, try explaining what you just read or wrote out loud. For some reason talking about these things really helps me out with long term memory consolidation. If you have someone that‚Äôs willing to listen try explaining it to them, and have them ask you questions about it. Thinking about your study material from different angles will help consolidate the details. 

Also, try to brain map! Drawing out your notes in a map form (central topic with offshoots that each have their own offshoots) requires you to mentally restructure the topics, and think about it more than just copying notes down, which in my opinion can help with memorizing it better. 

ALSO VISUALIZATION‚Äî after you write something down or draw it, carefully look at it for 20-30 seconds. Then close your eyes and try to imagine it. This is especially helpful for memorizing diagrams. Flash cards do not work for me unless it‚Äôs for memorizing definitions and stuff. Idk I can usually get a lot done with these methods because if I get tired of writing I can try visualizing stuff or try talking about it and that can help a lot."
