If you haven't already, please step away from the balcony. Killing yourself over your parents not working out and the suffering they've probably is not fair to you, but it is also not your responsibility. What do you like to do? Do you have any friends or family yiu can go to? If not, I can be your friend. I know it's easier said than done, but try not to be too hard on yourself. I'd be more than glad to talk if you feel like venting or talking through your situation. I know it's hard to remember this when you're surrounded by dysfunction and BS you never asked to be born into, but there are good people out there and in this subreddit that are there for you that can help."
