datingoverthirty,fphbme7,t1_fph82jj,1588618385.0,"Same! I felt like a stranger in my own home. It helped me to scrub the place squeaky clean and disinfect it from top to bottom. It was therapeutic to imagine I'm washing him away from MY home. 

I also bought a cool espresso machine - something I wanted for a long time. And decorated my balcony. So now I know I have corners in here that he didn't see or touch, so it's my home now."
datingoverthirty,fphal0b,t3_gdg8jc,1588617866.0,"I'm (31F) going through a breakup myself. After 2+ years of relationships and 8 months of living together he (36M) became violent out of the blue with no prior signs. We broke up the same night and he moved out the next day. This happened a month ago. It was a complete shock and now I feel completely alone being closed in an apartment. 

I totally understand what you're going through and I'll try to list what helped me during these times. Disclaimer: I'm not feeling great doing these things but they actually helped immensely not going crazy. 

1. Talk to friends, family or anyone who will listen. Even when it's hard to open up, I promise that it's far more difficult not doing it. 

2. Exercise. Even if for 15 minutes a day. YouTube is a great source of routines. 

3. Clean up the place. And I mean disinfect it. Scrub everything including windows. While cleaning imagine that you wash away all the negative energy that he left and all the failed dreams that you two had. Until I did this I couldn't feel like I live in my home. It felt like I'm in a stranger's place. 

4. Work. If you have the possibility to work from home, dedicate your focus on that. Don't overwork but when you do work, try to focus your mind on those tasks. 

5. Cook. Cook something you enjoy. Spoil yourself. It doesn't need to be super healthy or anything. Just something that will make you feel good. 

6. When you shower imagine how all the negative feelings and thoughts go out the drain. Wash them away like you would some mud on your skin. It helped me literally imagining how my negative thoughts are dirt and it's washing away of me. 

7. Masturbate. I know at first you don't feel like doing it. But it releases endorphins into your body so you will feel better afterwards.

8. I know it's hard to imagine yourself with someone else right now. But flirting helps. I started flirting with some guys online (nothing serious, just for fun) and it helped me imagine a better future. I hate new beginnings and I hate imagining that I'll be with someone else. But now instead of thinking like this it's easier to imagine what I will feel - the butterflies, the sex, the adoration you get from someone at the beginning of a relationship. 

9. Cry. Cry your eyes out. Bring everything you feel to the surface. And at some point you'll just stop crying... 

Be strong and be kind to yourself. You're doing the best you can. Good luck.

Edit: you don't need to do all of these now or at once.  For the first 2.5 weeks I could barely dial into my meetings (I'm working from home). Start with something you can do now. And each moment each day select something from this list that feels doable and realistic."

Reading your update helped me understand that I might be really putting myself in danger if I forgave him. Even if he is in therapy now and regretting his actions, there are no guarantees that he won't do it again.

My bf (35) was the same - needed plenty of time alone and never lived with anyone before. 
At some point we decided to move in together. We sat down and we've discussed what we'll do when we need time alone. We got to an agreement.

It hasn't been easy but we did get to the common ground. When I need time alone I use the spare room or go out for walks, gym, etc. If he needs time alone he just has to say it and we decide how to do best.
The problem is not about changing the person. It's about finding a common ground and openly discuss your needs. 

I think the biggest issue is not his need to be alone more than you do. I think it's the fact that he didn't think to look for a common ground for the sake of your relationship. It will definitely be an adjustment but as long as you want to be with that person and make her happy you'll find a way. If not, you'll find excuses.

I'm not sure I will be able to help because all moms are different. But I realized years later that my mom is not ill-intended and the only thing she wanted to hear and see was that I'm happy. 

She told me this in my face: that i dont look happy being single and earning a shitload of money that i dont spend on kids. I started reassuring her as often as I could that I'm happy and well. And said that if she respected me she would have to accept that I have different timelines and approach to life than her. But again ""I'm absolutely happy with my life"". 

I'm not a mother but I do believe it's incredibly hard to start seeing your child as a grown person who ""knows best"" after you wiped their asses (literally).

So she suggested to touch my own body in a loving and conscious manner in the shower, observe how nice my skin feels, and how strong my body is, and how nice my butt is etc (you get the point). 

Another one for me is that I feel loved if he does things for me that he knows I enjoy - like going to the theater or concerts or spa with me. So my therapist proposed  to do the exact same things myself without expecting this coming from someone else.

Discuss romantic time. Staying together becomes very convenient at some moment. In my experience I realized at some moment that we're not romantic anymore.

AskWomen,fh26c9u,t3_f0zz7p,1581237272.0,"I went out for a brunch with a friend. When I came back home, he (my bf) cleaned the entire house, washed the floors and did laundry. 
A week before that he brought me flowers and cooked for us. 
He's definitely a keeper.
Edit: clarification on who cleaned the house"

AskReddit,ffud6lw,t3_ev9x0d,1580239483.0,"I smoked for 15 years before quitting. I think one of the biggest factors was that I was sure I won't be smoking forever. And just one day I thought that this day is as good as any other day for quitting. 

Another big factor was my boyfriend who is a non-smoker. It was just so much easier to quit with him around. When I quit I realised also how much positive influence I could have on other smokers around me. Having a support system is crucial. Right now, only around 10% of my friends who were smokers back then are still smokers now."
AskReddit,ffucq9p,t3_ev9x2o,1580239215.0,"Not sure my answer addresses your question. But after I gave up smoking I realised that we can teach ourselves to do anything, even if it's disgusting and awful for us. AND we will like it in the process. 

I was sure that I enjoy smoking before I gave up. I was so wrong... It was just a learned response of my brain to make sense of why I keep doing this disgusting shit."

relationship_advice,fe4x110,t1_fe4u5im,1578863577.0,It might be a weird question but how long into your relationship have you felt this? If I'm not feeling this for my SO does this mean that I don't love him?
AskReddit,fds5cv0,t3_emy4tq,1578694716.0,"I think it's about the daily activities - making sure that what I do on a daily basis is something that sparks my energy, imagination and passion. It never was about ""suffering now for the long-term good"" for me. I think I just tried to have fun. For me ""fun"" included knowing what I do and being good at it. I love the superiority feeling so I chased it as much as possible. 
Obviously all jobs have bad days. But if most days are good, you are ok."

dating_advice,fd9d7zu,t3_ekcvm8,1578231757.0,"One of my closest friends started dating my ex after we've been together 3.5 years. I resented her for this and we stopped talking to each other. 

It's been 12 years since then and they are now married. But I still hate what she did without at least talking to me first. Also, I have some trust issues with my friends since then. 

So at least be considerate and talk to her first. Explain your feelings and ask her if she would be ok with you dating him. And then make a decision and own it."
AmItheAsshole,fd9b4n3,t3_ekcwi2,1578231011.0,"I have been in a similar situation that your gf is. There are 2 sides of this imo. 

1. You will need to sit down and negotiate your way out. Your ideal frequency is 3x/week. Hers - 3x/day. Try to find a middle ground. For example: 4x/week PLUS sexy text messages to each other in the days w/o sex (to build up the horniness, and show her you still desire her).
2. Her self-confidence needs to rely solely on her, not on someone else's actions. Also, she needs to find new coping mechanisms for stress (new hobby, sport, long walks, boxing, etc.) Therapy could explore and help with both self-confidence and coping mechanisms; maybe this is the answer."
relationship_advice,fconyid,t3_ei55b8,1577837000.0," Something similar happened to me with an ex. After we broke up he saw a girl in a porn video who apparently looked like me. He was delusional.
It wasn't of any help for me to try and defend myself. He was convinced of the shit he made up. 
We've met 6 months later and he admitted that he was just hurt and saw things that weren't there.
I think there is nothing that you can say to convince him. I think it must be him who decides to see the truth. 
Good luck."

unpopularopinion,fbxlnwi,t3_eeru6r,1577193031.0,"Could this also be because people still think you need to have a perfect relationship? All around me I see couples who don't open up about their issues. They seem perfect together and when I was younger this made me think that it's something wrong with me if I can't find a perfect man for me. 
Recently I started opening up myself about the issues I'm struggling with. And I realized everyone is dealing with shit in their relationships. Sometimes it's even the same shit with yours. 
So maybe if we talked more, we knew better. 
Dunno. Just a thought."
datingoverthirty,fbuhq40,t3_eekhjl,1577114601.0,"I have a very similar story so I know what you're going through. I'm sorry and be strong.

Sometimes we need to let people get their shit together by themselves. Focus on how you want to be treated and what kind of vibe you want in your life. The rest will follow. Sometimes it will be the same person coming back, begging for forgiveness and changing his ways. Sometimes it will be someone else making us happy. 

Just follow your path. 

Edit: if you can, don't be there when he picks up his stuff. Let him drop the key somewhere when he leaves."

Also maybe try to split the tasks and responsibilities? This way you know that you get the credit for your work and she does for hers. 

And if you still compare yourself to her then give yourself some points for managing two small children and an office in a HEALTHY way achieving proper work-life balance. Working through your weekends and holidays doesn't sound like offering your 13 year old a meaningful relationship and quality time."
