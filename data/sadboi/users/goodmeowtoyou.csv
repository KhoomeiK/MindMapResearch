AskReddit,fr5378m,t3_gmlkr7,1589901690.0,"When I heard my mom only had about 2 months left to live. For five years up until that point, I wished, hoped and prayed for a miracle. Seeing things get gradually worse as the time went by and still trying to be optimistic -- never treating her like she didn't have a future -- is the most difficult thing I've ever been through. 

One day we had a discussion on the way to a family event about her pain. It was causing so much anxiety, depression and exhaustion. Every day became an attempt to ease discomfort with pills, patches, heating pads, TENS units, topical analgesics, etc. She said if life was going to continue being that way, she was ready to go. And I agreed...despite every single bit of me being terrified to lose her.

Hearing the news of so little time left and not knowing how to tell her. Only knowing that all my attempts and optimism and positivity meant fuck all to a ravenous disease dissolving her spine, ribcage and skull. My faith in many things was destroyed -- God, medicine, self-help gurus touting cancer cures via juicing and *just believing.*

I am not bitter and I don't hate the world; I just miss her and I don't want to see others go through this."

No one has been an asshole when I've had to pull my mask down just to get some fucking air when the dinner rush gets extra intense and I'm struggling to cut, add crust flavorings, ice cinnamon sticks, sauce wings and juggle a sea of tickets and try to assemble orders flying out of the oven nonstop. But I am waiting for it because we are all so over this shit and are ready to snap.

We are hot and we can barely breathe and we can't hear each other through these breath-and-spit-drenched rags we have to wear so lazy people can have their junk food with the illusion of safety. We keep adjusting our masks because we have to communicate and talking makes them slip down. The ones my restaurant provided hurt my ears, also.

Also our hands are sweating buckets all night long and we have to remove gloves to wash our drenched and pruny hands just to put gloves back on. 

It feels so nasty to be wearing this crap, and I have to spend 48 hrs a week being this uncomfortable. I don't get paid any more during this time, so...

Go make your own food maybe.
