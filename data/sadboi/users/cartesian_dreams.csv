musicprogramming,fnhdkyl,t1_fnh8et6,1586960355.0,"Not as yet. My foray into musical programming has only just begun really. I come from general computing background, career wise. Then I have been noodling with live synths/drum machines my whole life. I always felt that there had to be better ways to perform complex live electronic music, and have contemplated it for 10+ years. Live bands lose the intricacy/depth possible with complex electronic music, but things like Ableton live aren't really live at all in my mind.
I guess what I want is ultimately a solo playable band/orchestra of synths and samplers, but truly composed live with full expressive capability.

I guess I'm trying to develop really complex, multi-track, generative arpeggiators; which can then be played by a normal keyboard & MIDI controller. Eventually VR kit I think would be an ideal controller for this stuff, I'm interested in virtual performance too. Imagine a whole immersive 3d world being part of a music visualisation/performance. Taking it to extremes you could generate it all from an instrument, like the holophonor in Futurama.

I started putting together a prototype in max, but reached the realisation that I'd basically have to go deeper to do things properly. I got bogged down in dragging out thousands of patch cords.

Been working on supercollider now and just getting to the point where I think I've learnt it well enough to actually begin implementing again. SCLang is a strange beast! I know enough programming to generally pick up new languages and run with them; but supercollider threw me for a loop (pun unintended!). I found it really difficult to get my head around the way it worked."

livepa,fnds31b,t1_fmy5t5v,1586876422.0,"Absolutely. I guess I've been playing with hardware for 10 years now, from e-mu px-7, to octatrack, tr-8, electribes. But previously I was more of a noodler/tech geek. I came to a point where I threw in the towel a few years back, giving up on my dreams of music as frankly everything I made ""sounded cool"" but was musically shit. I had always figured I just wasn't born with ""the gift"" like some of my friends. 


After a period of time away, the bug started to itch again. I need to make music, no matter how shit!!


However; this time I started learning the basics of music theory. Something I'd always avoided and been under the impression was a combination of snobby wank; and sheer memorisation and motor skill (scales/recitals/etc).

I think looking back,  I really got screwed early on by uninspired /bad music teachers at the child/high school level. My disdain for this side hamstrung me.


Finding some cool YouTube channels and focusing on just playing keys, suddenly it was like the secrets of the universe were laid out before me (or at least a path into that realm). It was all mathematical, relational.. A system based on physical science, something I could understand. (I'm a programmer/computer systems/science minded person).

It's been about 18mth since I started the theory reentry to music. I have a long way to go, but I'm able to see the basics of what works, why, and navigate my own creations without feeling lost or totally guessing.  I've owned a few pieces of gear in that time, but not a live rig. Mainly just my System 8. Various money issues/housing/ real life has held me back from building a live rig, until now when everything is sorted. Moved into a house I own, where I can setup a permanent base for music, toned back my career to make time. I have actual ideas i want to explore. I'm just waiting for a sum of money to be paid to me which will be any week now. 

For once, money is no issue either (I mean.. Within reason. A complete custom modular that achieves all requirements would be out of range). Previously in life, budget has been a constant constraint and more often than not hard road block to my desires in many ways. That said I'm trying to be very budget conscious still, as I'm a firm believer in minimalism and not throwing myself into noodler oblivion.


So I have a good idea of what ""areas"" of gear I need/What type of performance I want, but yes... The final key will be finding things I gel with and limiting myself to mastering them. I guess this is why I am being so obsessive about planning - it's a once in a lifetime opportunity.


Things I want:
1 thick bass/lead - analog mono would be nice with a wild filter and drive. Step sequenced in the style of classic modular/analog - e.g. a row of 16 knobs for pitch per step, rather than the 303 style ""stepthrough"". Poly maybe, but not necessary.

Chords/strings/arps/melodic content - system8 could work as a basis with its 2-part multitimbrality. It's bigger than I'd like though. Been thinking of swapping for a jupiter-xm, but i do like the full synth control surface of the system 8. Thinking of adding a volca FM for extra tone source, or something else along those lines. Play live keys and/or step sequence

Full mixer - multiple drum channels, flavour samples individual synth channels, at least 2 fx sendswith full return tracks for dub style feedback

FX - bitcrush/samplerate reduction/dubby delay/time mod fx/reverb - filters for fx chains. Desktop units or pedals.

x0x style sample drum machine. Integrated or separate live looping/resampling/slicing. (Ahem.. octatrack most likely. Maybe MC707 or Deluge?) I'd like an analog drum synth machine too, but thats more a studio kit i could sample for live

If live looping needs to be separately achieved (ie don't have octatrack or mc707) something with MIDI sync.


That's my superduper epic idea. There is part of me that also wants to build a battery powered porta-rig with battery powered PA for busking/camping/etc."
