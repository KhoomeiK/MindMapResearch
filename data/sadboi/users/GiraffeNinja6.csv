At this job, theres no forklifts where I am working.  Only when were walking out to break we walk through a department with one or two riding ones going at a time, but the ""Going To Break"" group is about 30 people long so the fork lifts stop and wait. Most people take their hearing protection off before walking through the building though seeing as the majority of the potentially damaging noise comes from our own machines and some construction noise because they're rebuilding in our department.

I paused writing this to eat dinner, during which the bird was biting my dad's butt and when I turned to look at him, he bit me. We moved his fort to the floor next to the TV but he didn't seem to like it and returned to the old location of his fort.

therapy,fhjyksr,t1_fhjrgyn,1581659722.0,"You seem to be giving a bunch of people advice and I admire that. 
Unfortunately, or fortunately I guess, my therapist told me the exact same thing today. That it doesn't matter what my diagnosis is, but to just work on the symptoms. And that diagnosis is mostly for billing purposes anyways. I cant help but feel very upset at myself though for being so diagnosis-driven and needing someone to tell me what I feel is real enough to have a name. 

You mentioned bpd having ties to infant trauma in another comment and that rings true to me greatly because I lost the support of my earliest most trusted primary caretaker and I feel like it deeply unsettled me, but in a way I can only describe using words other people have used and it makes me feel disingenuous. I was a daddy's girl from Day 1 and a week before my 3rd birthday, he was incarcerated. I was never formally told what happened to him until I was 13 and allowed to have chaperoned conversations with him. 

I think most of it is how I fear others will perceive me if they have it in their head that I am doing it for attention or lying so I can be lazy and not talk to people. One thing my therapist has said for sure is that I almost invariably have social anxiety, but all anyone ever tells me is to stop being shy. That is, until I told them I was going to therapy for it. Then magically it made sense to them.

I am almost considering changing therapists only because I think what I struggle with is not in his realm of expertise. He is more in the wheelhouse of addiction and motivational interviewing. He is struggling to let me be vulnerable without trying to come up with a solution right away.

BPD,fgpc299,t1_fgoufe6,1581001727.0,"Yea I imagine myself struggling to let myself need help and refusing stuff because i dont feel like i deserve it, but then Jenna breaks down my walls and allows me to accept help. Then Julien teaches me to Be without fear of judgement and plays catch with me for hours. 

Right now in real life, I asked my dad to play catch with me the other night since I'm trying to nurture my lifelong interest in baseball and I accidentally threw it too hard and it went over the fence into the neighbors yard. Julien totally wouldve offered to jump the fence with aries flair...but my dad said Oops well that's the end of the game.

Every time I come home from work now I look at my ball in the neighbors yard and cry a little. Maybe if I wasnt such a pussy I could ask them to get it for me, or if Ring wasnt so pervasive and teenage innocence doesnt protect me anymore, I cant go in their yard and get it myself."
BPD,fgofj7q,t3_ezi5uy,1580968218.0,"Mine is a bit more morbid. I imagine myself in a scenario where I am in a horrible accident that causes me to be in a hospital for an extended amount of time. The accident has to be something entirely the fault of another because my fantasy world doesnt need anymore guilt. Like being the unfortunate only injured victim of a crash between two other cars. Wrong place and time kind of stuff. 

Heres the kicker...I pretend I'm being cared for by my favourite internet celebrities because the ambulances arrive and they accompany me to the hospital and we become close friends. I prefer to imagine Jenna Marbles and Julien Solomita because they seem like such kind, caring, and empathetic ""woke"" people who would not only know how to care for me, sympathize with me (because they've been in a car accident too where they were injured for some time) and then afterwards we are really close friends who arent afraid to talk and be vulnerable with each other and I feel safe. 

Other times, itll be family that respond to me and apologize for everything that happened in my past and I finally get closure.

A lot of time I also go so far as to imagine being injured and in casts and I lay really still. It helps my imagination AND forces me to lay still while my brain unwinds. :)"

As of now, I played for about an hour and died already. I saw some iron exposed in one of those tiny tube tunnels that you think might lead somewhere but dont...there were two skeletons in it.

Also Jack from Fight Club because that was the name of my sister's cat growing up and they have the same colouring. Names are hard!

But I do understand what you mean. At my last job, I was pretty close with the supervisor. He texted me while I was at a day program for dbt for a week and a half. I thought I had a positive role model in my life for once....he ghosted me once i quit. 

I try not to reveal too much of my life to ""work friends"", I try to keep it professional or surface level personal like explaining why I am hoarding the cardboard cores from label rolls to give to my gerbils I plan to get soon.

Originally, the CEO of my company didnt want to hire me because he didnt want family working together. My current boss and my future boss (I'm being trained in one department to move to another) teamed up and vouched for me saying I was worth it. 
I still struggle to believe that this actually happened but I know the CEO doesnt like to hire family members and that discussion is the only logical way I even got hired. 

Oh but one I dont struggle to see is that I am kind to everyone until they're mean to me first. I've only been at this job for 3 weeks but I make it a habit to smile at everyone and make them laugh and always try to talk to them if I can (due to language barrier) but our cultural differences make it so some people in there naturally dislike my race. I'm kind to those people, but man when they're falling behind on work I take an extra minute to twiddle my thumbs manically before helping."

Alone, I worked faster at certain tasks than 3 people who didnt know what they were doing...so I got burnt out and quit xD Now a department manager heard I was looking for a new job and offered me this half-way position of assistant supervisor where I do the inventory and man-hour paperwork and also help with efficiency, help fix spots where work slows down and show them how it could be done better or faster. 

Also, I was told the quality control supervisor wants me too so I said when they have an opening, I want to go there instead and my manager friend said he would support it.
So there's a possibility I wouldnt even need to do this stuff for long."
