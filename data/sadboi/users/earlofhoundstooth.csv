Most scary to me though is the fact that the money collected for taxes has just been drastically reduced. The US has never faced unemployment on this scale with a social program like this in place, but the outflow will be staggering because not everyone unemployed has even been able to file yet. More will come as buisnesses go bankrupt, causing their suppliers to etc. The depression will be fierce. 

So, money going into the government piggy bank goes down, money coming out of the piggy bank goes up dramatically and we just borrowed $2 trillion, how long does the piggy bank have before it can't meet it's obligations? There is no realistic end in sight for this thing and even if we fix it tomorrow, the economic damage is inestimable. Don't count on those checks to roll out forever."
