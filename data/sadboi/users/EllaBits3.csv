TooAfraidToAsk,fovzli0,t3_g9uym2,1588110315.0,"As a fat person who used to be on the dating scene, I hated being called out for my weight. I tried to seem confident and like it didn't bother me, when 15-25% of me hated being fat. 
I hate how it made people assume things, instead of getting to know me first, which to be fair, in order to be fat, certain things need to be true about someone. They are addicted to food in some fashion, they are depressed, or on a downward spiral, or just don't care. All of those things are a big problem. So when you're on a site looking for love or sex, and someone says right off the bat, they reject you purely because of the choices you've made(being fat is a choice, prove me fucking wrong) that's hurts man. 

Now to address my fatness, i own it and acknowledge it 100%, and I am working hard at loosing weight, and getting healthier, truly. You don't realize how bad and uncomfortable being fat is until you lose those first 15lbs.

Now I'll say the divisive sentence again:

Being fat is a choice usually caused by some degree of mental illness, and being called out for your mental illness you have control over is too much for a sick person to handle sometimes."

My 3 favorite books which are greatly different from one another, but also have such rich stories, and one in particular had a bit of mystical lore in it that keeps it fresh in my opinion. 

Hearts In Atlantis (Low Men, grandfather type mentors a young boy in a small town)
Rose Madder (The one with the mysticism, a woman absconds from her abusive husband and tries to start over)
The Stand ( speaks for itself, as most people know of this book without having read it. It is LONG, but so involving, I love and have gotten wrapped up in this honker several times. Randall Flagg as a ""villian"" is chilling, a mysterious ""virus"" kills majority of people in the US, and the survivors try to band together)"
