SwordAndScale,fqzkv82,t1_fqx2yd0,1589769508.0,I read your explanation incorrectly sorry lol. A picture would still be considered libel as well if it was posted online or in a paper etc if it's with incorrect information or statement :)
SwordAndScale,fqwnnio,t1_fqw3gop,1589711183.0,Libel is the term used for written word that's defamatory. So if you write something that's untrue about someone in an attempt to make them look bad and ruin their reputation it's considered libel. (Or in pictures and signs) It's literally just the opposite medium to slander someone.
CrimeScenePhotos,fqwm3hi,t3_g2gsqn,1589709521.0,"I don't think you're right. Could have swore this is from Sue Whites attack...I'm 95% sure it is.... I can however understand why one would think it was from the benoits house though, they are very similar in colour scheme.  

""11/05/06- Cherokee County, GA. Sue White was doing dishes while her 7yr old daughter was on the computer. Her daughter asked her to come help her. As she left the kitchen, a man smashed through the window and attacked her with a gun. He tried to shoot her, but the gun jammed. He beat her with the butt of the gun and proceeded to rape her. He stabbed her at least 25 times, until she was unconscious.  
He turned his attention to the daughter believing White was dead. She was not. She grabbed the butcher knife used to stab her and attacked the man. They struggled for control of the weapon, and she mortally wounded her attacker- a man she had went to high school with. You can see the cast off blood spatter on the ceiling. One of the bloodiest crime scenes IÂ´ve ever scene. ""

The crime scene photos associated with this (including this one) Are all the more impressive once you see the gruesome damage that was done to her and yet she still lived and used the adrenalin to save her child AND mortally wound her attacker. She was virtually indescribable, I was genuinely surprised she survived

I would link but I wasn't sure if that is allowed."

SuicideWatch,fqdjpmx,t1_fqcov3y,1589291121.0,"> This forum is for hearing people out, but I don't hear a lot of solutions 

You just explained the reasoning within your own comment. You're right, there aren't a lot of solutions...because that's not the purpose. The purpose is to allow people to feel heard without judgement. Personal experience isn't the same thing as professional advice. Just because something works for one person, doesn't mean it works for all. It can be detrimental if that ""method"" you're giving doesn't work for them as you run the risk of making them feel like there is something wrong with them because it worked for someone else so it should have worked for them. And it's not your place to decide what is or isn't helpful based only on the fact that you ""are well after 8 years""

Sorry this is probably none of my business, and congratulations for getting to such a good place in your life, but it's slightly unsettling when you're saying things like ""Which is more than I can say for many here."" as if you're superior to those posting because of it. There's also no need to make passive aggressive ultimatums "" I can move onto other forums and my time there"" because a comment was removed."

SuicideWatch,fqckg3k,t1_fqby8qx,1589260584.0,"Does it suck that it's not necessarily an even playing field? yes, but TBH I think people are angry at the wrong group most times. The real people you should be challenging are the government. Even if these people did ""help out more"" because of the way everything is set up, it wouldn't help as much as one would assume. It would only be a short term fix that would land you in the same position again once your taxes spiked and you could have to pay a large portion of it back in the long run."
SuicideWatch,fqcjbzs,t3_ghjgnt,1589259714.0,"Reminds me of my dad. His motto for life was ""regardless of how you feel about someone or what they've done to you, if someone comes to you always make sure they leave you happier than when they first came."" He's seen the worst of you  and loved you through it up to this point, maybe the key is not to lie and say you're fine if you're not. Because you are so close I imagine he knows something isn't right but doesn't want to push you into talking about it until you're ready. It won't stop you feeling the wy you do, but that unconditional love and support may just make what you're going through feel a little more bearable knowing you don't have to face them alone <3"
SuicideWatch,fqch68f,t3_ghvbca,1589258108.0,"I don't normally comment on things, I'm usually a complete c\*#t to be honest, but for some reason when I read this something resonated with me to a point where I've come back to read it multiple times and almost feel like I have to say something.

I won't say I understand what you're going through because everyone experiences things differently. I also won't tell you that everything is going to be ok and that there's some magic answer that's going to make everything ok for you. What I will say is that regardless of what you've been through, your past does not define you, nor do the people you spent it with. Easier said than done but don't allow others to take up space in your head if they aren't paying rent. If they don't bring anything positive into your life they have no business having the opportunity to bring in the negative. Forgive me if I word this in the wrong way, I can't think of another way to say it and it's definitely not meant from any place but a good one. Stop thinking that your life has to revolve around other people, ie your parents. I assure you, just reading what you've written shows the exact opposite. It's theirs that revolve around you and it's them that will be at a loss not having you in their lives not the other other way around. It's hard as fuck to walk away from people you think you have to be tied to for the rest of your life even when they're toxic, but unfortunately sometimes it's needed for your own survival. You can't build a new life when people are constantly and selfishly taking from it without caring how it affects yours. You deserve better. Counselling worked once, maybe try that again? Or look into abuse support groups in your area. You don't have to share your story until you're ready nd cn listen to others to see that you aren't alone in this and there are ways to help if you're willing to try them. Plus you'll meet new people in your area that can sometimes open up more job prospects. Realize It's ok to not be ok. There is not a single person on this earth that doesn't to some extent feel the same wy about their own lives at some point. Lean into those that love you, know that more do than you think and just don't know how to show you. Let go of the things holding you down. (again easier said than done I know) Just breathe and remind yourself that nothing exists without its opposite and there's a difference between being a failure and being failed.

as for the rest, try calling 211, they will know all free programs in your area including financial help, mental health, places hiring etc and can help connect you to the places that will help you get to a place where you love your life again. Have you completed your taxes for 2018/2019? If not that could be causing issues with your unemployment. Call your student loans and explain the situation, there may be grants they're able to give to either cut down what you owe or erase it completely. You could also try volunteering somewhere for a bit. I know lots of places consider hiring their volunteers if they see they are a good fit and some will even pay for you to get the training needed if there are aspects required you aren't completely qualified for. You seem like a resilient person, that's not going to make it easier, but it is going to show you you're capable of defeating this.

Sorry for the rant. Fingers are crossed for you <3"

In a grocery store if someone was to do something as small as coughing, the store runs the risk of having to throw out thousands of dollars of produce etc and shut down their stores so it can be completely sanitized.
