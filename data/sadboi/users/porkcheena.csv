I’m so happy that you have a happy healthy toddler running around! 

I know our story’s are not the same, but you have really put me at ease regarding the whole process. 

Thank you so much for sharing your story! Much love and I am sure that others will feel so inspired and helped, beyond just me!"

Did you end up having a c section? Did you have a good birth experience?"
CsectionCentral,f9o8rn0,t3_e6631w,1575498899.0,"Wow you are amazing. I feel like, if it wouldn’t hurt your journey or cause further trauma, I would like to hear your story. Please share more if you can.  I think others would feel the same. 

I’m currently 11 weeks. Terrified of birth. My therapist thinks I had some sort of sexual trauma, but I’m not sure I have. I can’t process that thought a lot bc I’m currently processing my PTSD, depression and anxiety. I’m trying to find a new normal without meds (bc baby!). 

A C section seems much less traumatic to me. And I want a happy first interaction with my little one!"

OP you got this! That teacher genuinely wants you to succeed- remember that when times get rough. 

As a former teacher, I would lose sleep regularly worrying if my students were safe. Take a minute to update her on your life. It’ll mean the world to her. 

I would bet ten years from now she’s going to remember you and still be rooting for you."

LifeAfterNarcissism,esfz9vl,t3_c7l7xi,1561938854.0,"It really stinks to want to enjoy but feel negative emotions too, especially on a day everyone else seems to love so much. 

Not everyone loves celebrating bc of those conflicting emotions. That seems to go for most holidays, not just birthdays. You don’t feel alone in this! The emotional toll of abuse or trauma makes it tough to feel emotions- especially joy for some of us. 

My advice, and it’ll get better in time, do something for yourself. Buy a thing you’ve been wanting, get takeaway, go outside and enjoy. Make it something you will enjoy on your own without others. If you’ve got good people in your life include them in this celebration on your time. 

Hope you get to enjoy your birthday in a new way!"

depression_help,es77p7f,t3_c69keq,1561665431.0,"I think people say this to be self righteous. Everyone in life has something that they struggle with. And a mental illness just happens to be a very common thing many struggle with. 

I had a friend who said similar. It caused me to feel quite down. However, I realized it for what it was- judgement. I cut ties and am I much happier without the bullshit! 

Reach out to friends who will support. You are under zero obligation to be around someone who makes you feel bad with the deck you’ve been handed."
ptsd,es47qr1,t3_c5ss8g,1561578883.0,"Good for you getting therapy! 

The symptoms do get better- but can be up and down as you tackle them head on in therapy. Hang in there and be kind to yourself. I know easier said than done. 

You don’t have to tell anyone about ptsd. You talk when you want to. Some people who you may expect understanding from could be jerks. Some you might never guess will be the most understanding.  Honestly one supportive person can make your journey much easier. 

I’ve been diagnosed for two years, but have had it for much longer. My therapist thinks childhood (I’m 35). Initial diagnosis was angering but understanding ptsd makes me better able to handle.

I do best on my own with therapy. The key is in my alone time I try to do something productive. Yoga, gardening."
