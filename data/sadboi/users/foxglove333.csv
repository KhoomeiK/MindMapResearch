Like how immature are he and his friends to turn against you for being smart and saving both your lives. You should tell the mediating friend that you literally saved both of you from getting stabbed and that your sorry if it didn’t work out like a movie but real life can’t be risked to fight crime like Batman. Ask him if he’d rather have his friend and you dead or in the hospital with stab wounds? Obviously you did the right thing and it’s pretty lame that he’s blaming you for him failing to deal with the situation maturely. He sounds like my ex who punched a random cat caller for my “ honor” and ended up getting us both kicked out of a nice restaurant. Fake macho guys are often the most cowardly he sounds like a real mamas boy for ignoring you and setting his friends and mom against you for something that was totally out of your control.

Everyone knows you NEVER fight back or argue with an armed mugger it would take just one wrong word to get stabbed to death! All it would take is the mugger being on drugs or just pissed or scared of your bf fighting back and you’d both have been brutally stabbed to death. One stab wound could kill you lightning fast, in that situation adrenaline is high and your bf could’ve caused the mugger to panic and get violent. You NEVER fight back against an armed assailant his little hero fantasy is just that, a fantasy. Sorry but you did the right thing giving him your wallet and helping you both escape, if that emasculates him it’s kinda sad that he had his little fantasy shut down, men are funny about that kinda thing and he’s probably feeling like a loser.

I totally get your point I just think you’re wildly reaching and trying way too hard to read into characters like goblins.

I mean it’s sort of similar to saying that Anne Frank shouldn’t have her nook out there because it deals with sensitive issues, it’s not always gonna be perfectly perceived by everyone or even accurately understood. I still think it’s really good the way the books frame how flat out deadly it can be to value a certain group of people too highly over another. The order of the Phoenix literally hides and saves people who are being rounded up by the ministry, and it’s amazing how the books have this way of subtly showing how the media can slander someone’s name so easily and cause havoc. I think re reading with a little bit of thought for nazi Germany makes the series make a lot more sense."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fq4idec,t1_fq4gltl,1589078141.0,"I just don’t read the books with those vibes at all, so I guess it’s a matter of opinion. I personally don’t think Hermiones anti house elf slavery club spew was meant to be downplayed as funny at all. I think the other characters didn’t take it serious because they didn’t quite understand the problem, similar to how some people didn’t see the problem with Hitler during nazi Germany. The villains in the book seem to me to represent extremely classist and are obsessed with pure bloods, but it doesn’t make them better it actually makes them ignorant and wizards like Dumbledore are constantly having to try and pass laws to protect muggles. Did you ever even read the books more than in passing and see the horrible scenes where witches and wizards without pure blood are being rounded up and having their wands taken away by the Voldemort controlled Ministry of magic? And Harry literally has to rescue a whole group of muggle borns from being executed by the ministry? Never once in the books is is framed as a good thing that the evil death eaters are basically racists or otherwise discriminating against certain people. Lupin is an outcast and it’s considered very sad and unfair and Dumbledore gives him a job when no one else will. Honestly I don’t see any of the examples you gave as racism it’s just more a subtle pointing out of problems that exist in society."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fq4f5uk,t1_fq4dw4w,1589076983.0,"I respect and hear what your saying, but I have to say my literary analysis of the themes in Harry Potter is completely different. I definitely don’t see any racism there and if anything I always read the books as showing how awful the “pure blood mania death eaters” were terrible for valuing pure bloods over muggles and I saw a lot of similarities to Nazis with Voldemort and the death eaters, and Harry literally frees a house elf from slavery. Hermione has a club to try to liberate house elf’s and I feel like anyone who’s truly read the books can feel the vibe that JK Rowling is trying to say that it’s evil and wrong to view the werewolf’s or the elves as lesser beings and how people should stand up for their friends against prejudice. Harry’s mom is even called a mud blood and is  muggle born, and there’s a whole part of the book where Hermione is crying and hurt over Malfoy calling her the mud blood slur. I honestly have no idea how anyone could see anything less than a lovely book about magic, friendship and the power of love. Then again we all interpret literature based on our own views.

The CIA trained and armed those rebel extremist groups like ISIS they created terrorists as an excuse to take land and it’s sad to see soldiers think they’re fighting for freedom when they’re just killing for corruption.
relationship_advice,fplllop,t3_gdxjbn,1588714924.0,"Honestly it’s probably gonna blow over once they talk it out, I have a brother that I’m incredibly close with, best friends really. And hell do we fight like cats and dogs in our teen years especially on and off, and it gets vicious. We’ve been in full out screaming and hitting matches telling each other to kill themselves and that they’re a burden etc, we get so angry at each other for the stress of things that we can really blow up and say some awful hateful things in the heat of the moment. Afterwards I’ll always be so upset and think we’ll never be close again but after a few day’s to weeks of staying apart and cooling off and eventually apologizing to each other we’re right back to being best friends and hanging out together thick as thieves. Some siblings just go through rough patches I may have said I wanted him to die a few times in anger but of course neither of us ever really meant it no matter how much we said it. Anger and jealousy over friends has caused some of the worst fights but they do get better."
TrueOffMyChest,fpfm4ox,t1_fpflx6b,1588575565.0,"Yes yes exactly please share the video and I have other friends who are nurses telling me they are being pressured to put people on ventilators that they NEVER would normally. Normally you have a hard time breathing you put on an oxygen mask and it reallly helps good most of these patients could have been saved. The doctors and nurses are being told not to call codes and not to resuscitate people. Aka basically trying to make 40,000$ by pressuring elderly or scared sick people into using medical equipment that isn’t ethical. Please just see what this nurse has to say. https://youtu.be/3QtXHg-zAYU"
TrueOffMyChest,fpfltln,t1_fpfki6t,1588575278.0,"Here’s a nurse talking about what’s going on in New York hospitals. All is not as it seems, they are treating the patients wrong they are killing the elderly by putting them on a ventilator before it’s absolutely necessary. Doctors have come out saying that they are being encouraged to go for a ventilator on young patients too, instead of just an oxygen mask or CPAP. You don’t need a ventilator in most cases that’ll permanently damage your body and you might not come out of it. The ventilators are killing people for 40,000$ each https://youtu.be/3QtXHg-zAYU"
DemonolatryPractices,fpetic3,t1_fntwqlt,1588554599.0,"This is very interesting very similar to my own conclusions about heaven and hell and other afterlife’s being pocket dimensions created by these beings to herd souls and keep them separate from source energy. I consider all deities and gods and demons and angels to be expressions of the demiurge. Apparently our souls are recycled one way or another if we choose to go to the “light” with Jehovah or if we choose to go hell, the only way to escape is to exit the system entirely."
unpopularopinion,fpeouqn,t3_gcupr6,1588551792.0,"I completely agree it’s so sad to see innocent and kind young people being fooled into joining the military because they are bored or don’t have a direction in life yet. Then the government takes them and sells their souls to be murdered overseas in pointless oil wars killing people who have no idea why they’re even fighting each other. Pawns on the chessboard, it’s sad to see healthy young men maim and kill one another for the same government that doesn’t and never will support, help or care about their wellbeing. Don’t even get me started on how we toss veterans aside as trash and don’t help them at all, war just creates traumatized children reliant on big brother for the next kill job. It’s just as bad as child soldiers."
unpopularopinion,fpeohvp,t1_fpeo4ku,1588551572.0,"Those terrorist organizations never actually existed, it was all propaganda. Osama bin Laden was a CIA asset and if you dig deep into the militaries activities in the Middle East you’d see that most of the “terror groups” were trained by CIA to give an excuse to invade and take resources. It was basically a completely useless waste of life on both sides and the US had no justification to waste lives on their psychopath agenda."

In my friend group the skinniest girls, me and my other friend are considered the hottest by the guys and get compliments from guys and insults from girls. It’s an insecurity thing sadly a lot of people feel insecure about weight and body so they try to make it seem like their concerned or whatever.

""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."" Ben Franklin. You don’t think there’s never been a plague before? These things happen and calling a police state into being is never gonna end because once a virus is out it just keeps on mutating and there will never be a vaccine that can keep up with the already 30 mutations. Just like the common cold and flu this virus will have to run it’s course and people will have to make their own choices. I’m immunocompromised and I am not willing to stay home forever because of a super flu. If I die I die, oh well there’s 7 billion people."

I consider them to have actual souls and spirits residing in them, especially the more ancient and well established trees have so much love and wisdom to give. I’ve actually seen a glowing woman with a purplish glow and wings made of light at nighttime by a 150 yr old fig tree I love to meditate by. I love touching and hugging the trees and do meditations to share energy back and forth and communicate with them. Trees are incredibly beautiful and living beings with their own slower and less obvious minds. Keep learning the methods and you can connect with many different trees. Try putting your palms facing the tree and stand back 20 feet, slowly walk forward and you’ll feel the place where the trees aura extends to it’s almost like a slight thickness and density in the air the closer to the tree the hands are."

Never hear about that do ya?"
PublicFreakout,fol8w0s,t1_fol8ll9,1587857197.0,Yawn. By the time they fudge the numbers and claim every pneumonia and random heart attack death as “related to covid 19” the numbers will always seem off. Do your research the math just doesn’t add up doctors are being ordered to write covid on death certificates when cancer is the cause of death. Whole thing is corrupt along with the WHO and CDC.
