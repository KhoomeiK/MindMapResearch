Anxiety,fkapx49,t3_fhf7bs,1584016431.0,"I did a whole summer of, what I called, the ""no phone project"".... I was a live broadcaster, had followers and friends, all the social media sites, loved posting my daily life.... You know, I'm sure.... Then dropped it. I needed time away-I was consumed. Not gonna lie tho! That shit was hard! Real hard! Going out into public w/o the security of my phone! Nevermind being home w no phone! (not having many real life friends) Having to entertain myself. Not being able to connect w ppl like I was uses to... It was lonely... But things slowly started to change for me (not that I can say I don't miss it)  I noticed I got more confident while being in public, not being able to hide behind my screen, I was living in the moment to what was in front of me (that's huge) I enrolled in a painting class (I have social anxiety), loved it! I started getting out more-the library, bike riding! It truly has brought me good things and if you told me that at the beggining I wouldn't have believed you. So as I see you writing this, I have to say, keep at it! The true friends will come looking for you, you'll make new ones along the way, and although it may be scary right now, it will be worth it! I promise you."
