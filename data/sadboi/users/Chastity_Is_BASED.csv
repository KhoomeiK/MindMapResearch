it will have its own DNA and be its own unique person. If taking away a woman's ""right"" to kill this developing HUMAN BEING is going against autonomy, than so be it. i just proved its a human being growing in it's most innocent phase. it didnt ask to be conceived. 

and yes the women had sex, thats fine, but if you consent to sex, you consent to pregnancy if that happens, so know its not a punishment for forcing them to keep the baby, its the natural consequences of sex.
