imaginarycosmere,fga3ur5,t3_ex7nei,1580646409.0,"Very, very nice, I just wish it had more TASSELS. This mistcloak doesn't really ""cloak"" anything, even if it looks cool.

Edit: Damn, I hate to have to add some real criticism to such a nice piece, but I just realized those daggers don't really look like they could be anything other than metal. Mistborn, including Vin, use glass daggers so that enemy allomancers can't fuck with their weapons."
DepressionRecovery,ffl6wbo,t3_eu2xhp,1580035638.0,"Completely agree with FivesG, listen to them and ignore your clueless friends. 

That said, staying with a particular therapist or medication only makes sense if they're working out for you. Finding the right therapist for you is important, and everyone's response to various antidepressants is different. For some people one medication, once found, works long-term, for others like myself a lot of medication works in the beginning but 6 months later seems to lose its effectiveness (which is why my psychiatrist finds something else to try during our appointments). Don't forget that you can't really expect new medication to work until 4-6 weeks in though."
depression,fd40t1c,t1_fd3dtfi,1578163340.0,"I guess that's something to explain lack of contact, so that's helpful. But is there a better way than just saying ""I'd rather not go into detail, it's private""?"
depression,fd21msb,t3_cml6ni,1578140259.0,"I don't know what to do, one of my symptoms is regularly ghosting people because I lose all energy for social engagement and after a fellow student I got to know whose phone apparently broke around the same time texted me again recently I vaguely told them I was having trouble with my studies due to ""health problems"". Now I don't feel like I know them well enough to open up, don't want to just ghost them again, and have no idea what to write/say. This isn't the first time this has happened either :(."
rpghorrorstories,fbtrmvf,t3_eedktc,1577092144.0,"I don't really see how OP ""ruined the campaign""? They went all the way to the boss fight, and when that went down too quickly, within RAW, the DM had a ""backup"". And the Sorcerer had a way not to be completely useless to the end oh no, the temerity. Not to mention that the DM killed off two PCs right before the Boss fight with that ridiculous white dragon ambush.

Considering how he's apparently shown incapable of intelligently applying advice before I can only hope people the players eventually went on strike and the DM spent some time as a player, experiencing proper DMing and hopefully learning something through that."
rpghorrorstories,fbtrgah,t1_fbthhyc,1577091865.0,"It read to me like the DM suddenly announced that a missed Eldritch Blast hit the Adult Blue Dragon that was flying overhead, but I could be wrong."
depression,fbgi6or,t1_fbfaaww,1576850162.0,"That's the point. ""You're being such assholes it doesn't even feel like we're related anymore"". Clearly that's implied in telling them to suck their dick.

WormFanfic,fba88do,t1_fb9tatq,1576669439.0,"When playing Singed, the default play style is to have other people chase you. Considering how many random people you'll face while being a regular player, there'll be jews among them. So the comment obviously wasn't meant to compare jews to Singed, but to point out that aside from that IRL anecdote he's also chased by jews (and everyone else) online.

The reason it's in bad taste isn't because of Singed's looks but because he leaves a trail of poison gas and in the game lore is known for chemical warfare :/."
WormFanfic,fall21n,t1_faktwp8,1576186144.0,"Huh, that's some sad news and some good news. Thanks for the heads-up."
WormFanfic,fakb620,t1_faipepm,1576164116.0,"Can confirm on Taylor Varga and A Cloudy Path. Although I don't know if ""glacial"" is quite the right word. Is there something like a glacier, but two-dimensional and constantly cycling around its own axis?

Speaking of the latter, whatever happened to A Cloudy Path anyway? I don't think it's getting updates anymore unfortunately..."
liquor,f8cflk0,t1_f8bxc5t,1574459199.0,"Huh, that's surprising, Buffalo Trace can be had for less than 20 without shipping, yeah. J guess Bourbon in general is pretty reasonably priced here, it's the Rye Whiskey that's unreasonably expensive for the most part. Although there's definitely also a lot of supposedly very good bourbon that you just can't get your hands on over here. Old Grand Dad has been mentioned ITT."
liquor,f8azczl,t3_dzu1rj,1574420180.0,"If Sazerac Rye is like 30 dollars where you're at I'd consider that, it's nice and availability in Germany is pretty bad, until recently it was like 70â‚¬ online  and now it's still at least 45 I think."
ComedyCemetery,f4pp5ge,t3_dlcp9u,1571739665.0,"I mean, as long as nobody's trying to pass this off as a real exchange it's not even that bad a joke. The image is more efficient than full narration of ""she texted her boyfriend under the table...""."
insaneparents,f1gejx2,t1_f1feufg,1569465624.0,"Find a smell that agrees with your brother and you but that your parents abhor, then have it emanate from your room all day and night but hide the source when your parents are there. Hopefully that'll have them insist on a door in your room again :D."
