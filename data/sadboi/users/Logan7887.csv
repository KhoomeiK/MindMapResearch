JustinGuitar made a video in which he reviewed an acoustic for about 30¬£, and he said that it was a little difficult and certainly unpleasant for him to play it. Although electric guitars, even the cheapest ones, are perfect imo for a first guitar. Justin also made a similar video but reviewing an electric guitar for about 60¬£ if i remember correctly. Watch it and You‚Äôll know what i mean. Personally I‚Äôve been playing an acoustic for 8 months and I am planning on buying an electric in the future, probably some Squier or Jay Turser. Obviously, when You‚Äôve got a lot of money, it‚Äôs better to go for something better, but in any other case, don‚Äôt go on an unnecessary spending spree."

On the other hand, with electrics, especially when it comes to buying Your first guitar, almost any instrument will do. Look up some videos on YT reviewing the cheapest guitars on ebay/amazon etc. They are much cheaper than 200$, and still, they sound quite good.
