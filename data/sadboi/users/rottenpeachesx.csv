BPD,fpe5mtx,t1_fp9gupq,1588540829.0,"Thanks so much for sharing! I agree with your points about medicating before big pharma. I've only tried Celexa, an SSRI, but the side effects were enough for me to want to ditch meds that I was already skeptical about to begin with. 

As the user above suggested, there's this supplement called Joy Filled. I looked up the constituents and bought each herb separately so I could have more control over the dosage of individual ones. 

Right now I'm taking 5-HTP, St. John's Wort, Ashwaganda, Eleuthero, Rholiola, and Gotu Kola. I've been on them for less than a week so I can't comment on their effectiveness.

I've read that trypo helps activate 5-HTP, is that why you're taking that?"

I just fucked up most of my grades in uni so I just feel like anything important I have to do I'll mess up. Anyways, I called him and asked if he could just come by and cuddle me when I was sending emails and doing phone calls. He had plans to do a podcast with a friend. I was really crushed but tried to be understanding. DBT helps! If it had happened last month, I would have not been able to manage outwardly."

BPD,fom1n7l,t3_g841js,1587875870.0,"He sounds like he really loved you and was patient. You mentioned he's your friend. I'm assuming he's still in your life and doesn't want that part to change. 

If that's the case, this break could be the best thing to happen to your relationship. Take time to yourself, to get to a pretty positive place. Start distracting yourself with your favorite hobbies, make new friends or hang out with old ones. Workout, even if it's little and infrequent. I promise it'll feel good and boost your confidence. 

But also remember that the relationship may just stay friendly. Try not to have any expectations and be grateful that he's still in your life. 

I went through something similar recently. The best guy I've ever been with and I split a year and a half ago. We stayed friends and talked to each other, sort of, for almost a year. As time wore on, I was building up confidence and realizing I just wanted him to be happy more than I wanted him to be with me. I realized that I truly loved someone for the first time, instead of just loving them loving me. It was eye opening and I decided then that I was just really grateful he was still in my life. We got back together in December. Things do get better and if you work on yourself I think this can happen for you too! 

By the way, I by no means resolved all my BPD issues. They're still there affecting our relationship. But it's healthier. Don't ne hard on yourself and expect perfection before you reach back out to him either. Best of luck to you!"

BPD,fo1ylw3,t3_g58uha,1587444689.0,"I feel the same way once a week it seems now. It's getting more frequent. But, there are times, however foreign or distant they feel right now, that you're happy you're alive. You won't feel this intensity of complete shit forever. Probably not tomorrow even. You might still feel pretty terrible, but not like this.

I hope this was okay for me to say and not too much projection onto you. What I really mean is it will get better. Then it will get worse. Then better. It's exhausting AF but the reason I haven't killed myself is because I'm scared. And if I'm honest with myself it's because I'm scared of missing out on the tiny possibility that one day I'll fix myself. I hope you can hold onto that hope for yourself as well."

Sometimes I wonder if I'm just so obviously fucked up somehow that people just want to run away. What's further confusing is people seem to absolutely love me the first few times I'm around them. Then they will slowly and politely start pulling away or abrupting disappear. Either way, I never know what I did wrong to push them out. I wish more than anything I did, so I can change it and not be alone."

But I can tell you I like it a hell of a lot more than talk therapy.
