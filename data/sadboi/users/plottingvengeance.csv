But if they‚Äôre the type that would get offended, it‚Äôll only exasperate the problem for you.  It‚Äôs up to you to gauge.  I think community centers sometimes have low cost therapists, try to see if yours does. 

This isn‚Äôt a substitute for therapy, but there are some apps that are about mindfulness and mental health...  apps like Shine, Sanity & Self, or Betterhelp might help.  Some of them have free features, but the actual counselors and people you can talk to on there cost money.  The premium memberships are pricey, but if it‚Äôs out of your budget, take advantage of the free trial period even if it‚Äôs only for like a week.  Listen to some of the podcasts on there, they have all kinds of stuff for different issues you may be facing!  (As well as the actual people you can message about things).

It hurt, because I loved him, but it‚Äôs weird to think I might have just been under a spell.   Especially when I realized I hadn‚Äôt even been attracted to him at first, to the point where my first thought of him was ‚Äúew‚Äù but then shortly I was head over heels??  It fucked me up."
LetsNotMeet,euuyxmu,t1_euu1vha,1564052927.0,"Yeah, it‚Äôs definitely not light hearted stuff.  The relationship didn‚Äôt even last too long, but damn, it‚Äôs been years and reading things like what you wrote still sends me back.  I usually comfort myself by telling myself weirdos like that are far and few in between."
LetsNotMeet,eutv21s,t3_chdreq,1564032240.0,"Brian reminds me of my ex... like everything about the way you described him.  And that guy ended up being a total psychopath (literally).  Even though I never saw an altar, through dreams and stuff, it was slowly revealed to me that he was doing black magic on me.  I essentially ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù to the fact that that‚Äôs why I had become obsessed with him so much.  This stuff is real, but at least now you know OP.  *shudders*"

astrology,eucy1k9,t1_eucvf43,1563691572.0,"Thank you for your input!!  I appreciate your perspective/expertise with the Taurean people.  lol YES, you hit the nail on the head with them not expressing their feelings well.  As an Aries female, I basically threw myself at this person (meaning, I did a lot of the chasing and initiation on social media) and while they actually seemed sort of receptive... it was like they were still content with things staying the same.  It‚Äôs the most confusing thing ever.  His stability is what attracts me to him though..... But being bad/routine in bed would probably be a dealbreaker.  Hard to say though since I haven‚Äôt tried it yet.  :( Lmao"

RedditForGrownups,eu6vduh,t3_cf19i2,1563509984.0,"The world will always be shit.   Somewhere, somehow.  The wrong person at the wrong place at the wrong time.  Shit, I personally believe the whole Illuminati crap and that‚Äôs why nobody can break free from this place until we literally die. 

But you can learn to create your own personal happiness, safe and tucked away from the rest of the world.   For me‚Äî it‚Äôs been the small things, such as decorating my room the way I want it to.  I tell myself it isn‚Äôt selfish to be so ‚Äúmaterialistic‚Äù.  Plus, how many people can you help if you, yourself, aren‚Äôt taken care of?  Be nice to yourself and remember you are worthy.  Feel whatever needs to be felt... sometimes we truly *can‚Äôt* ignore those things, but remember that even in this cold, dark world you can still be a light to yourself and others.  In fact, the world needs you to right now the most."

But now it‚Äôs *all* about [the Instagram](https://nypost.com/2017/06/13/the-rise-of-the-instagram-face-and-how-its-destroying-us/) look.  I hate it too."

For me, I realized I liked my guy friend when I started learning more things about him.  He just seemed super interesting, and the more he talked, the more I asked questions to make sure he kept talking.  His voice is still so sexy to me.  I can‚Äôt explain why, I mean.... yes, he is physically attractive to me, but it was his wit and personality that drew me to him most.   You just want *more* time with them."
