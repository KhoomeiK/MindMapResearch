ferrets,f8jwny5,t3_e0t2nk,1574605024.0,"This is so cute! My first ferret, Molly, would climb to the top of the Christmas tree and then plinko all the way down it, trust falling on and around the ornaments like an exuberant slinky. And then she would repeat this action over and over. It soon became clear that the tree was like the best ride ever. :)"
AskReddit,f6ams0f,t3_dqq9oe,1572759199.0,"I had a six year old client hold up his pointer finger on one hand and his middle finger on the other, look quizzically at both of them. Then he held up his pointer finger and solemnly stated that this finger was ok. And then he held up his middle finger and said ""this is a bad one"". I honestly didn't know what to say to that. I mean he was totally right in the sense that pointing one if those fingers gets a huge reaction. It was one hell of a moment holding the space and realizing I had absolutely nothing to say to that."

ferrets,f5ddm3r,t3_dnfhlf,1572152173.0,"Random advice :) feel under your bathroom and kitchen cupboards. If they have open space make sure it's not into the structure of the apartment/house/etc  I've taped up lots of small open spaces to keep them from wandering. 

Puppy pee wee pads are great for potty corners 

They can open all cupboards floor level. 

Check under your bed for missing stuff. 

Ferrets are so wonderful. Once you have a ferret, they mark your heart for life. Congratulations on your new amazing fuzzy snuggle worm adventure."

BPD,evva765,t3_cl6jkw,1564827842.0,"Hello! You may want to look into art therapy. Creating artistic imagery with appropriate materials can help with processing aspects of trauma in ways that verbal therapy may not always be able to access. With a professionally trained art therapist you are potentially able to tap into subconscious and lost memories through art making, bringing them to the forefront. 

Art therapy is a growing field and neuroscience is only proving its value when used with a trained art therapist. There are plenty of peer reviewed research based articles easy to find on the internet about this.

I wish you well on your journey :)"
starbound,evlb4kb,t1_evkhdrc,1564592525.0,Well it's a bit janky but I got the breathing EP and went to a hard world and skipped the up top monsters and continued to mine down till I got a really great double handed gun and sword. I prefer the rifle and sword combo... I think I found one of those crazy blue elevators on a planet like that where the monsters could kill in one swoop and then chuckled happily over my new prize. So not really any good advice. I'm sorry!

cat,euqdylu,t3_ch186j,1563976468.0,My husband and I have had ferrets for the last 6 years plus but both had cats when we were kids. We had forgotten how weird cats can be. It's hilarious.
cat,euqdnnl,t1_eupk7m3,1563976280.0,Yes! We also got his sister too. They are estimated to be around 7 months by the humane society. They stayed in our closet forever and have now become relaxed enough to accept pets and climb on top of the couch! They don't know how he lost his eyeball but apparently when he came in it was hanging down. We call him Odin :).
TrueAskReddit,erd79j6,t3_c1f35h,1560733029.0,"What about all humans having an instinctive need to build shelter? I don't have any idea if that  actually holds merit but it seems like something interesting to chew on if you like pondering the possibility of evolutionary reflexes. 

I remember watching a documentary years ago about babies showing an instinctive fear response to spiders and another one about why we fear the dark. All survival based so why not a positive response to survival by innately enjoying creating shelter through play?

Edited: grammar"
