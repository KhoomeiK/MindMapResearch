They didn't give him the tools he needed in the off season like usual and they didn't replace our defense with quality players. This is such a dumb move and I can't wait for it to backfire. I wonder who will score less next game, us or the dolphins? Fuck Shumur, fuck Gettleman, and fuck the organization. I'm sorry they are doing you wrong Eli, you deserved so much more."
