Children do things like that because they don't understand, adults are supposed to know better.

Did you know the older ladies strolling by? If not, you have no way of knowing if they might all be women who *wanted* children but never managed to have any.

I do not have children, on top of that my older sister passed away very suddenly on Mother's Day (years ago)... do you think I would appreciate some random man I don't know shouting Happy Mother's Day at me?

AmItheAsshole,fqbkgy5,t1_fqbestk,1589238666.0,"Perhaps you should reread the OP and my post a bit more carefully? You seem to have misunderstood parts of both...

*Everyone* was joking about sex in general. OP's sister apparently had no issues with it (so much for your ""boundaries"" theory) until OP's boyfriend made a joke that ""implied anal sex"" (and yes, I know that OP did not say that the joke specifically implied something about their personal relationship), at which point: 

She scowled and said, ""You shouldn't talk about that, it's disgusting.""

Considering the overly conservative / pro-life / martyr behaviors she has also displayed per OP, it's highly unlikely that it was a judgment *just* about anal sex.

Is that an assumption on my part? More like an educated guess. But it stems from significant close observation of behavioral patterns of people in general, so I would be rather surprised if it turned out to be incorrect.

And to be fair, I didn't say ""this isn't the first time she says she disapproves of their sex life"" as you apparently read it. I said I bet it's not the first time she has intimated disapproval of their sex life. Which, for the comprehension lacking, means that I can easily imagine she has attempted to subtly (and probably not so subtly) do so on other occasions. A statement of opinion and likelihood, not a statement of fact as you indicated.

So yes, his sister is the asshole for being rude and judgmental, and I personally don't find OP's response to be rude (I read it as more tongue-in-cheek and a bit reactive), therefore he was NTA. His sister (whom he knows far better than you do) has made attention-seeking martyr comments for years, he simply used that to return fire. Was it mean-spirited? Well, she didn't like it so obviously she took it that way, and OP even acknowledges in retrospect that it was, but so what? When a person acts like an idiot they shouldn't be surprised if others make them the butt of a joke.

OP is NTA here, obviously the alcohol may have impacted everyones impulse control, but his sister opened herself up to judgment the second she was judgmental herself.

PCOS,fqb4ddg,t1_fqb1ppo,1589230371.0,"Thank you! :)  I'll admit, it wasn't easy getting here. It's certainly true that the majority of unkind comments in the past were while I was in middle and high school myself, but as an adult I've realized that although those were largely intended to be malicious, it's not worth holding against them. At that age, humans lack in impulse control and really do not fully grasp consequences. I've reconnected with a few former classmates and looking at their lives and who they are now, I think if I told them ""hey, way back when you said the following..."" they'd be beyond mortified.

Kids do a lot of bullying as part of pack/group behavior -- if a person seems ""other"" / doesn't conform somehow (be that physically or behaviorally), it's *important* to force them out and away from the pack/group resources. It helps reaffirm that they conform, meeting that need to be included, while giving them a sense of contributing to the health of the group. What's unfortunate is those behaviors stem from genetic impulses built into one of our strongest evolutionary drives: ensure the safety and survival of the species. We've reached a place where those drives no longer serve us properly, but it will still be a very long time before they filter out of the genome. As adults, we have a better chance of recognizing impulses that are no longer appropriate given how our societies function, but it's still difficult to completely ignore them (think of all the ""us vs. them"" mentality out there). I greatly look forward to the day when we emerge as non-corporeal entities, both because such drives will largely have vanished and because we won't need to pluck, shave, etc., any more. ;)"

PCOS,fqazyy2,t3_ghpn1f,1589228191.0,"For those who've had people ask about it:

Out of curiosity, is it mostly younger people? Like teens and kids I mean, or do you actually have young adults / adults asking?

With the younger kids that I've had ask, often making entire rooms go silent (and their parents internally die a very cringey death much to my amusement), it's usually been just a matter of they've noticed something that seems different so they ask (because they're still learning that it's not always polite to ask some questions). I just smile and explain that everyone has this stuff called ""hormones"" and mine just don't quite work right but that doctors don't really understand it very well, then usually make them laugh telling them that I shave it because if I didn't I'd be way more attractive than their dad is and that would hurt his feelings. (And then the room collectively begins breathing again.) Teens, on the other hand, have a tendency to ask when they have a friend they're concerned for or if they've noticed stuff about their own body that's starting to concern them. Honestly I actually feel very touched by the inquiry: they feel safe and comfortable enough to ask me what they know is a very personal question -- I can only assume it's because they've observed over time that I try to be as non-judgmental as I can, that I try to listen and give thoughtful answers to questions. It's kind of a real ""warm fuzzies"" moment, even if it's not necessarily an emotionally easy conversation to take part in.

One thing I've learned over the years is that most people that ask aren't trying to be malicious or make us feel bad, rather they're often asking because they either can't contain their curiosity any more (and that's really not a terrible thing in the grand scheme of it all) or because they're hoping to learn something that will help them interact with / help someone else. So it's often similar to the teens, they feel comfortable enough with us to ask what they know may be a very touchy kind of question. Plus, the reality is that most people really don't even notice it -- we think they're staring way more than they actually are -- and generally won't bring it up when they do. It's difficult to remember that sometimes, when we're feeling particularly vulnerable, different, even gross, but really everyone (us included) is usually so wrapped up in our own stuff internally we aren't *actually* staring at things around us even though it may look that way.

The rare handful of people trying to be jerks (interestingly: nearly always women) are usually easily recognizable as such and I personally delight in giving rather vicious responses. For example (and feel free to have a hearty chuckle from it if you so desire. to this day I still do): I recall a slightly younger than me coworker some years ago who, by dint of having a crush on the cute guy in the office and having no idea how to flirt without getting in trouble, started getting jealous of the easy relationship he and I had. We regularly had lunch together, chatted, etc., and I know it came across ultra flirty to her (because, to be fair, my personality is very flirty, so even if I'm not actively trying to flirt it can often seem that way). She decided to be what she thought was subtle and asked about having lunch with me (ostensibly to discuss some work stuff that I had ""such a good grasp on!""). I figured she was trying to figure out how to get closer to him and thought I might be able to help pave the way a bit (I wasn't interested in him beyond work friendship). If I'd realized ahead of time that she was going to try to make a few not-so-subtle catty remarks I would've told her to talk to her original trainer or direct supervisor. Instead, when she started dropping those little gems into the conversation I just smiled and tried to change the conversation, but after the third time ... well, I had given her chances to realize she was being a dumbass and she ignored them, it was her own fault I had to point out how the color she was wearing made her look sallow, that her hair looked so dried out it would make excellent kindling, and that her makeup looked like it was spackled on by a heavy-handed clown, but hey at least the cellulite baggies under her arms and around her thighs and rump would help her float come pool season... She left in a mortified huff.

And I know that ""mom voice"" and responding like my mother did before screaming/tantrums starts (or just as it starts) does actually work: my older sister lived with me for a few years when her youngest child was a toddler. *Every* time we went shopping, I pushed the cart (an OCD behavior) so he was directly in front of me the entire time, and while she would ignore him if he started acting up I would not. It was very interesting to me watching him look at me, then his mother, then me again whenever I used that tone and told him no, etc. Kids aren't nearly as dumb as the lazy parents think, they are intentionally pushing when they behave like that because they need to know where the boundaries are to feel secure and comfortable. The lazy parents have nutso kids because they never set or enforce boundaries. It was particularly interesting to me that at not quite 3 years old, it only took my nephew two times to learn that I would take away his treat if he blew up while we were checking out (my sister always grabbed one of those 99 cent matchbox cars to keep him quiet while in line). I didn't care if he behaved the entire time, if he threw a fit while we were checking out, I took it right out of his hand and told him ""no, you don't get it if you behave like this"". Twice.

OP is NTA, but the situation verges on ESH.

""Derek"" is a guest in the home, it's one thing to politely ask ""hey, could we all keep the chatter down please? I'm really enjoying this movie but it's hard to tune out the commentary and I keep missing things"", but it's entirely different to shush people over and over and then make it a sarcastic dramatic display of it when someone very reasonably asks to pause for a bathroom break. Yikes! And honestly, talk about unnecessary nonsense - if it can be paused, it can also be rewound, so there's no reason it couldn't have been backed up a lil once OP returned, meaning he wouldn't have missed anything at all.

The sister, wow, it does indeed sound like all sorts is going on there (having to pander to his bruised ego and control freak tendencies by demanding apologies ""or else we're leaving!"".... I can visualize the foot stomping from here), but emotional manipulation is completely uncalled for -- what is she: 12? (I will say, though, that a lot of women in relationships with the type of guy described have a tendency to double down when their family and friends disapprove and tell them ""he's a loser"" -- because they don't want to be wrong in their choice and listen to any sort of ""I told you so"" afterward, so be wary of repeating his negative attributes and unworthiness any further lest it make her that much more determined to make it work.)

And as mean as it is to say, the parents here are definitely assholes by being emotionally reactive rather than being honest, firm, mature adults. They're absolutely ""The Adults"" in this situation (I assume, they are the oldest people in the house right?), but their behavior is feeding into the toxicity rather than defusing, deescalating, and reminding everyone about the need for courtesy and civility during these extra stressful times.

In the end, if they remain, set and stick to those boundaries. He *can* be civil and courteous, or you have every right to treat him in kind and/or remove yourself from unpalatable situations. Just don't allow him to manipulate you into always walking away -- it's your home more than his, if you're watching something and they join afterward, continue to talk and laugh with your parents and if he tries to shush you point out that HE can go their room until it's done: you and your parents don't have to alter your typical behavior to suit him 100% of the time (and frankly shouldn't)."

Take the time to think about what you want to say to them, write it down in a note on your phone or laptop/PC -- get your major points in order and flesh them out a little. Revise a few times, so that you're making I statements about how you feel rather than angry aggressive accusations that will make them defensive and further closed-minded (even though you have every right to be angry and the accusations are true). When it's finally ready, print it out and leave it for them to find, don't text it -- that way they have to read it without you being physically or technologically directly in front of them. It may help them ""hear"" what you're saying better.

You definitely can do various DNA ancestry tests to reveal that the family already has some African ancestry (and who knows: you might find out that there's more than you expect!). And you definitely could use a genealogy site to actually pursue lost relatives and family history. While both are unlikely to change the mindset rampant in your family, it's possible that you may broaden a few minds a little bit -- particularly if you can approach it with an air of curiosity e.g. ""can you imagine what their lives must have been like, knowing how people treated them and looked down on them?""

There's this idea that gets into peoples minds that weddings have to be flawlessly perfect with no effort, and as I'm sure you're well aware that simply isn't true. Weddings are stressful -- they require careful planning of finances and time, awareness of family squabbles to prevent sitting Aunt Snide next to Cousin Jerk, awareness of Uncle Igor's severe kumquat allergy, etc., etc., etc. Trying to bring that all together and get to enjoy the fruits of it is a lot more difficult than many people realize ahead of time... and having that all upended by a global pandemic likely adds a level of crazy stress many of us couldn't imagine if we tried. You sound like an amazingly comfortable person, confident and secure in yourself and your relationship, is it possible that she feels extra pressure to avoid comparisons because she's less secure (maybe she's felt like you've out shined her on previous occasions?), or worse that impending new family members have made her feel like she's not measuring up to some invisible yardstick? Again, you're NTA but I'm wondering if there might be bigger underlying reasons why this is so important to her that she's willing to risk extra tension in her relationship with you (which I'm assuming is, typically, a good relationship). 

It's certainly not something that happens super frequently anymore, but is there any chance you might be able to combine your weddings? Speaking from a purely practical place it would eliminate comparisons nearly 100% and it would also reduce a bit of financial strain on both sides (as well as for out of town relatives and guests) - and there's no reason there can't be two lovely cakes (or hell, 4 big fun cakes -- let the grooms each have their own as well and quadruple the flavor varieties available). If neither of you had a super specific theme going on (Ren Faire, Piratical Zombies, Lego Robot Overlords, etc.), it might be a way to really come together for a lot more fun and a lot less stress overall.

Hopefully it will help him recognize that it's 100% a him issue and he has to evaluate if it's such an intense desire or need that he has to move on, or if it's just a passing desire.

You **can't** control how other people respond to you, how they view you, what they think of you, whether they judge you or ridicule you... trying to do so will only add to your exhaustion without accomplishing anything. So, although it won't be easy, try as hard as you can not to let those things become fixated in your mind: you know your truths, that's really all that matters.

You **can** only control how you react, though at your age that's still a bit difficult (physiologically speaking, no matter how mature you may feel, your frontal lobe isn't quite finished developing, so a lot of the emotional struggle is still a bit outside of your control -- but it will get better in a few more years). When you feel uncomfortable because of how others are treating you, you have every right to walk away - with or without explanation: you are only responsible for your own health and well-being.

You **can** choose to educate, when you feel strong and confident doing so, and you can do so with a smile and factual information. It may not change a single mind, or it might change many, but the important thing is you'll always know that you were proactive in trying to raise awareness rather than silently suffering. For example, when I returned to university to finish my degree as a non-traditional student (i.e. an older adult), during those first days of classes when instructors asked us to introduce ourselves with a few bits of information, I didn't share my favorite color or book or that I have a cat. Instead I explained that I have OCD (so I would always sit in the same spot), and that I have a memory impairment (so that people would know it wasn't intentional when I forgot their names), and that I have fibromyalgia (so that people wouldn't constantly ask if I was ""okay"" any time they caught me in those moments where I couldn't completely hide my pain). Yes, I had a few assholes who took that information and tried to be jerks, but I also found that most of my classmates were more considerate and thoughtful, and some eventually asked to have conversations outside classes so that they could better understand someone in their family or friend group.

Sometimes it's easy to brush off ignorant or cruel responses to our invisible illnesses, sometimes it's really not easy at all but it's the only option, but ultimately you may find that you feel more accepting of yourself and better able to handle the rough days if you don't hide or mask parts of yourself with the world around you. You may be surprised by how many people accept that it's just a part of you and try to be more mindful of how your responses may not reflect how you feel about them but rather how you *feel* at any given moment.

I am truly so very deeply sorry that *you did everything right* but reached a person who was so overwhelmed that she was unable to react appropriately. To be fair, though, there is a strong chance that she was only a volunteer and the basic training they receive really doesn't prepare them for how to cope either in this specific situation or when they're overwhelmed as many of them likely are right now.

Being frustrated, angry, hurt, losing trust, etc., are all ***appropriate*** emotional responses for you to have toward the situation.

It's entirely understandable, even *normal*, for your reaction to include becoming hesitant to interact with women if a similar situation occurs. But please know that not all women will react like this, even when overwhelmed, so if you do find yourself in this situation again when there are no men available: please don't expect it to end as poorly. It's unfortunate, but one thing you can do as a precaution to actively mitigate the chances of this happening again, is to explain that you have Tourette's which includes uncontrollable verbal tics which a woman may find offensive. If you give someone a chance to hear that, they can decide if they can handle trying to help you or if they should find someone else who's better able to do so, but either way it increases your chance of getting the help you need in a time of crisis.

I see that I confused you...

To clarify: I was not calling the portion of the menstrual cycle where there is ""no chance of pregnancy"" antediluvian, I was calling ***the method of birth control*** you're asking about antediluvian. Meaning that it is **so ridiculously inaccurate** as to be a prehistoric / medieval / severely out-of-date method. In other words, given the strides we've made in understanding how the human body actually works and the variety of much more effective birth control methods available... you should rely on modern methods (condoms with spermicide plus the pill) rather than risking pregnancy for a few moments of ""better"" (i.e. condom-free) sex.

To make it even easier, let's go back to your original three questions:

1) I heard there are 2 or 3 days in the month that a woman don't have eggs so she can have sex without condom. Is this true?

***For purposes of avoiding pregnancy***, just assume that this is **NOT** true and there are always eggs. *Always.*

2) Is it possible for a man to figure out when those 2 days in the month are?

Not without the assistance of modern science (and if you're going to use modern science to try to figure out what days a woman is ovulating in order to attempt to figure out what magical days could be condom-free, you might as well just give in and use modern birth control methods, which are **SUBSTANTIALLY** better at actually preventing pregnancy than the archaic ""counting"" method you're confused about).

3) Or is it only p ossible for a woman to figure this out? How?

   ...

   ...

   ...

Let's just say it's only possible for women and that we're not allowed to tell you unless you become a woman, all we can say is ""***just get over it and wear a condom!***"""
AskReddit,f4kcywf,t1_f2zi59k,1571646435.0,"The younger a woman is, the more it's an unconscious test of ""does he really like me?"" -- the assumption, of course, being that if you **really** like her, then you're attentive to the things she says, and you remember them, and so you should understand what she's getting at when she hints at something. Not the best communication about, true, but there you have it.

Note: Later in life, those are danger signs -- you've forgotten something supremely important \[anniversary, birthday, etc.\] and she's giving you a chance to realize it and, hopefully, do something wonderful to make up for needing a hint. Easiest way to prevent that: use your &\^%$ cell phone calendar to set up reminders for repeating annual events -- it's not difficult and you'll get a LOT of genuinely happy responses to always ""remembering"" those important dates."

It just does so many things to us in so many different ways that ""gross"" is a really excellent descriptor.

Fibromyalgia,f4ixww5,t3_dko9t1,1571610609.0,"I'm so sorry to hear there's so much extra stress in your life right now, that always makes it more difficult to cope with fibro pain and it's a vicious cycle.

From the sound of things, you and your grandmother **both** feel a bit like a burden, though really neither of you are -- it is simply part of life (I know that doesn't make the feeling go away, but it's important for you to remind yourself of that).

There are a number of things you can do to help ""unburden"" your mother. To begin with, talk to your insurance about medical transportation options. Even state health insurance will have some sort of set-up for that, and once you know how yours does it and do it once, it's super easy to do it again afterward as needed. For mine, if I have a very early AM appointment, we have to set up the ride the night before 7PM (I think, I try to avoid early AM appointments - I'm not a morning person LOL), otherwise it's done the day of the appointment. I let them know whether or not I'll need the return trip as well (even though that has to be called for after the appointment ends, I just feel it's considerate to kind of forewarn them if I do, or to assure them I have a ride home if I don't need it), and can even have the driver go past my pharmacy on the way home if needed, so long as I ask politely of course. It means a bit of extra wait time on both sides, but I don't mind that at all since it means not having to always have family take me (I too do not drive, many reasons).

You can also offer to help your mom with your grandmother by looking into what her insurance will cover for in-home nursing assistance. Even if it's only like 4 hours a day, that could be substantially helpful. I know it's not a pleasant idea to anyone, but if she's really not getting up much... it might be time to consider adult diapers as well. A bed pan may not be a good option, but if she's determined not to use diapers perhaps she would agree to letting your mom help her off the bed if you guys can get one of those elderly/handicap walkers that has the toilet seat and bucket (they're like $150ish on the amazon, but her insurance might actually provide one if asked). It could be a compromise that that helps everyone...

Lastly, in terms of trying to reduce your stress: do some deep breathing and meditation; go for a walk around the block, or at least go sit in the backyard and get a little sun and fresh air; use a rubber band on your wrist to 'flick' yourself if you notice that you're stuck thinking about all the stressful stuff (that barely noticeable little sting will help force your brain into the present moment, which is always beneficial); use every little trick out there to help reduce stress and anxiety to help manage your fibro as much as possible. And if eating is an issue at the moment, grab some snacks you can munch on without having to cook, sometimes we just need to get something in us and not necessarily worry about how healthy it may or may not be. Have no doubt: you'll get through this!"

childfree,f4iqmv3,t3_dkian2,1571608053.0,"I haven't had a chance to read through the comments, so this is probably at least somewhat repetitive (apologies!).

Is it possible that these friends aren't aware that you're CF by choice? It may be that they think you and your partner are unable to have children, so entrusting theirs to you in the event of their untimely death serves a dual purpose of trying to give you a gift they think you can't have (and, quite likely, they assume you happily say you're CF as a coping mechanism rather than as a real and active choice) and of placing the kids with people that they trust and think will be as doting/wonderful parents as they themselves are (after all, clearly you're secretly pining as any good person without kids must be). It's unlikely that leaving the house to you as well is meant to be an insult or commentary on your current living situation, but rather meant to indicate that you and SO ""wouldn't have to worry"" (about not having adequate space for children) as well as keeping them in the environment they're currently growing up in.

If these are friends who you and your partner are fairly close to, that you've known for a long time and value (despite the differences in your lifestyles) and would prefer not to lose if you can avoid it... your best bet might be to let Jon tell you about this idea they had, their reasoning, and afterward tell them with sincerity that you're truly touched by the amount of trust that they have in you guys, you recognize that it's a very big deal in a lot of ways, and even though it's unlikely that anything would ever happen to them (people need to hear that reassurance way more than you might believe) it's not something that you could agree to in good conscience. And then explain, not because you owe them the explanation but as a way to hopefully foster understanding and preserve the relationship (if, at that point, it's still possible to do so), that while being parents is obviously a decision that has worked well for them and for many others, it's not something you've ever wanted, that you're okay with occasionally helping to babysit in emergencies because that's what friends who care about one another do, but that you know you'd make a lousy surrogate parental figure because you just don't relate to kids well / etc. It's possible, of course, that they'll be more than a little disappointed to hear that sort of thing, Rachelle in particular might read heavily into it and go the angry ""oh so you don't like my kids?!"" route. If that happens, keep a cool head, call for the check immediately and give the ""this is obviously an emotional subject, we're not rejecting you as our friends or your children specifically - we don't want to be parents at all, so rather than any of us saying something we might regret, let's all just head home and talk in a few days okay?""

tl:dr - It may not be what it seems; go to dinner, hear them out, be tactful but firm, keep a cool head, but be ready that this might be the end of the friendship."

I also agree with the many who've voiced concerns about how the new incel might behave -- you can no longer accurately predict what he may do. It really would be in your best interest to have your apartment locks changed (heck they might even reduce or waive the fee if you explain you kicked out a suddenly abusive partner - even if they don't, it's too their benefit legally to do so), get a security camera, and maybe for a few weeks try to make sure you've got a friend or several with you when you're out and about. It might also be a good idea to enable your cell phones emergency message and GPS (better to have it on and not need it, than to need it and not have it on).

As for finding a new roommate, there are a lot of roommate finder websites, some only serve specific areas, but that might be your swiftest route unless you have a friend in need of space. Just be very up front about expectations (financial, food sharing, chore sharing, things not acceptable in the space \[smoking, etc.\]) and make sure they know what your ex looks like so that they don't get manipulated into letting him in. Volatile new incels are probably the thing I worry about most for all my female friends in densely populated areas. :(

One last suggestion: after you've had time to fully process all of this, go celebrate with your best friends (someplace you're unlikely to run into him). You've just opened up an amazing new chapter in your life, that's definitely something worth some pride, some moscato, and a whole lot of laughter. :)"

I'm going to voice a somewhat unpopular opinion to that. The long and the short of it: because it's something that only affects women **and** it's not immediately life-threatening.

I was diagnosed nearly 25 years ago, very little was known about it. (I just happened to have an OBGYN who'd read an article in a new issue of whatever research journal she was reading, and she felt like she was reading an article about me - she did one blood test to confirm the diagnosis, unintentionally traumatizing me, so it was years before I went to a doctor again to try to learn more and do anything about it.)

***Very little was known about it***, keep that firmly in mind, because at that point in time... the disease, disorder, genetic malfunction, endocrine f&$kup, voodoo curse, intense karma, whatever the heck each of us feels like designating it as, had been identified more than half a century prior. OVER FIFTY YEARS! And doctors knew basically jack-all about it.

In the past 25 years I've watched the symptom list go from tiny to huge and trimmed down again, over and over. I've seen symptoms briefly appear on it and be removed never to be returned. Sure, some of them probably should've been removed, some were probably indicative of other maladies rather than PCOS, but what galls me now, just as much as it has since the first time I saw that occur, is that every time the list changes assorted doctors indicate that it's because ""research is being done and we're learning more and more every day and soon we'll have better treatments, maybe even be able to cure it!"" ... and they do that for exactly one reason: to placate all of us.

Even if they've determined with absolute certainty why it occurs, who's most likely to experience it, and exactly how to treat it to mitigate nearly every symptom without causing new ones... they'll never admit it. It's more profitable to condescendingly pat our shoulders, there-there us, hand us scripts for six different things to cope with our worst symptoms (and several more to cope with the symptoms those medications cause), and to leave us uncomfortable, even miserable, because it doesn't immediately kill us... and *it doesn't directly affect penises.*
