My mom is an alcoholic, and when I was your age I swore I’d never drink because I didn’t want my loved ones to see me that way. 

I became a late bloomer as far as drinking goes - I didn’t drink at all in high school and then only a couple of times before my 21st birthday (I live in US so that’s the drinking age). Then last year my mental health got bad and my life was a mess...and I started drinking with friends. Let me tell you, it’s not good to drink while your mental health is bad. I should not have done that, but I didn’t care about myself at all. 

Not gonna lie, I have had some fun times drinking with friends. But more often than not, I regret it for one of a few reasons. First of all, it makes you feel like crap physically afterwords, and I was spending so much money! But worse than that was, even when my mental health got somewhat better, it always got bad again when I would drink a lot. Overall drinking is not all it’s hyped up to be in my opinion. 
 
The last time I drank I tried to hurt myself and my friends had to babysit me, so I decided after that incident that I needed to just stop. Today’s been exactly 3 months since I’ve drank and I don’t really miss it. You don’t need it in your life"

It was only the way they had him operate in relation with the John Legend character that I found sort of cringeworthy.  It is not that big of a deal and it doesn't have to do with you. 

Didn't know it was possible to twist ""I would have personally enjoyed it more if the leading man had been black"" into ""white people who like jazz don't exist"".

Absolutely not saying that white people can’t be excellent jazz musicians, and I know many helped pioneer the genre...but they didn’t originate it. 

If you’re gonna make a movie featuring a character who appreciates old school jazz, and gets upset when someone is “ruining jazz”, I just think it’s a mistake to not to have that particular character be black.  I would have personally enjoyed it more if the leading man had been black.

I think you're arguing with the wrong person here because ""always didn't like her"" couldn't be further from the truth for me.  I was rooting for her so hard!  I think she's had some good moments as an actress, but she can't quite get that consistency.  Which is why it's disappointing, because the potential was definitely there. For example in Sorcerer's Stone - she might have been a little over the top, but it's never bothered me because she WAS Hermione in that film. 

I know she's been open about the fact that she got tired and thought about quitting playing Hermione around the time they shot the 4th and 5th HP movies (because of the pressure and fame which is understandable). I just think it showed - those are the only 2 HP movies where her acting really bothers me.  That's why I said I get this vibe from her sometimes like she's burnt out or something.

This made me realize just how embarrasing I sound when I do that."

offmychest,fnghnjj,t1_fnfmoj1,1586932536.0,"Well said. Took the words right out of my mouth.

I truly recognize that I am privileged in this situation. I’m not complaining about the boredom, or the online classes (I’m a college student). I can deal with that. 

However my mental health has been total shit. I have anxiety and depression, and I’m quarantined at home with my parents who don’t believe those are real.  Usually anxiety is more severe for me, but lately I have just been so depressed. I know it’s a bad sign when I’m having trouble motivating myself to shower."
funny,fncpryf,t1_fnbu2bw,1586843318.0,"I love this story and I just wanna piggyback off it by saying this is not the only instance of her being amazing to a fan like this. 

just a couple days ago, I came across a video of her singing to a young fan with autism at a concert. His family allowed her to take him up on stage. She sat next to him on the bench and sang Million Reasons and kept making sure he was comfortable.

She gave him the hat she was wearing and then promised to bring him backstage after show and get him his own. I was tearing up by that point.

I used to be one of many people who thought her songs were catchy but her persona was kinda ridiculous. Now I’m proud to be a fan because she’s talented as hell, does a lot of charity work, and and is so kind to her fans."

I have both anxiety and depression. Usually my anxiety is more of a problem for me, but lately I haven't been anxious I've been really depressed.  

Thanks to those who have left helpful tips in this thread."

AskReddit,fn440vq,t1_fn32sfo,1586633611.0,"First of all I wish you the best and I’m sorry you’re stuck in this situation.

I don’t understand that either.  There are so many people out there who just cannot grasp the concept of accepting a “no”.

I had a good friend who I liked last year. I had really strong feelings for her and I spent a lot of time hoping she would too. When I told her, she did not feel the same way.  As soon as she told me no, I gave up on hoping. I never had the desire to try and change her mind.  

I’m not trying to say I’m a perfect person, but it’s not within me to keep pursuing someone who doesn’t want me. I’ve had people do that to me and it’s so awkward and sometimes downright uncomfortable. It can’t stand it.

I think the media definitely romanticizes pursuing the one you want to be with even if they’re not interested. Then when someone outright rejects someone, which everyone has the right to do, there’s always that horrible word “friendzone”.  That really bothers me because then people see it as normal not to respect others’ boundaries."

I liked both better than Bird Box, which they’ve been compared to because they all involve sensory deprivation in some capacity"
movies,fn3pves,t3_fz8who,1586625590.0,"You’ve probably already heard this, but I think a lot of people who like Hereditary also like Midsommar. It’s by the same director. I liked Hereditary a lot and I’ve been meaning to watch it soon. 

I don’t watch many horror movies, but I have seen the basic ones (Conjuring, Insidious, Annabelle etc.) I have yet to find one that’s made me freaked out in quite the same way that Hereditary has.  Something about it really got to me. Toni Collete was so frightening in that movie her facial expressions and screams just haunted me. Midsommar has Florence Pugh who although less experienced, is also a great actress"
movies,fn3oiq0,t1_fn3f4qn,1586624828.0,"I’m not the only one on reddit! I watched this with a couple friends and none of us liked it as much as we thought we would.  

Bale and Jackman were great but I agree about the too many plot twists. Overall one if the most disappointing movies I’ve seen just because I was expecting it to be fantastic."
AskReddit,fn394i9,t1_fn305hb,1586615770.0,"I agree, it’s really complicated. I think a lot of people with depression or mood disorders feel like they need to emphasize the “it’s a chemical imbalance” type of depression because there are so many people who still don’t believe depression is real because they can’t see it. So maybe people want to explain it in a scientifically proven way that’s harder to refute? 

Also, I’ve seen some people try to stress the chemical imbalance aspect of it because there are many people who have “happy” lives on the surface but they’re not immune to depression. The chemical imbalance explanation often applies to them and I think makes them feel valid because I’m sure they run into a lot of “what do you have to be sad about”

I could be wrong, just my two cents as someone who has depression and spends a lot of time talking to others who do too. I understand your frustration for sure. To act like it’s ONLY ever a chemical imbalance is not accurate either - trauma, grief, etc. play a huge part in many people’s battle with depression."
AskReddit,fn381bu,t1_fn34vdk,1586615071.0,"Totally agree. Even now that there are a lot more LGBTQ characters in film, they’re often really flamboyant or stereotypical. 

It wasn’t my favorite movie, but to mention one movie that got it right in my opinion - how *Booksmart* handled the Kaitlyn Dever character being gay. They had her crushing on a girl in the exact same way most movies would portray a teenage girl chasing a guy.  

It was not “here’s a young lesbian who’s troubled because she likes girls” it was “here’s a normal teenage girl being nervous about her crush” Her sexuality was a completely ordinary thing."

actuallesbians,fn0r0z9,t1_fmznlv9,1586547105.0,"Yeah that's what annoys me about people that complain about the increase in diversity in movies, shows, and games. 

My dad thinks the new star wars are bad but only because they ""got woke"". When I inquired about what that meant, he straight up said there were too many women.  I'm a woman so I just rolled my eyes as hard as possible.

Ok then watch one of the other billion movies with white male heroes.  Old star wars, Bond movies, Batman, indiana Jones, Captain america, Thor, Iron man, war movies, westerns, you have endless things to watch.  God forbid women get Captain Marvel. Or that someone other than white people get to be the lead once in a while, or that gay people are shown. 

I know not all guys do this. and I like those above listed movies as much as the next person! But it just irritates the hell out of me.  Women and minorities deserve a place in mainstream stories too."
