I had fallen asleep and was dreaming that my consciousness was being lifted out of my body, and while I didn't see anything else there, I had the strong impression that there was some omnipotent god or demon doing this, and that this was it's way of killing me. By pulling my soul out. I resolved that if I was going to die I'd do it with dignity, so I just waited there for the end, but by then I was back in my body. This is where the sleep paralysis episode began. I was laying so that I was looking at the street outside my bedroom window, and I saw a figure out in the street. It was a dark and flickering form about fifteen feet tall, with lanky limbs that gave it the appearance of a great shadowy stick figure, or a drawing of a person from a cave painting. It was dancing, erratically bending its limbs at impossible angles, back and forth, the dance was grotesque. I felt at the time that there was more significance to this character than its nightmarish appearance and dance, that to look at it was to look at the embodiment of some terrible realization that I was avoiding just at the edge of my understanding, and no longer being able to look away. 

And I woke after that.

Tl;dr. First it felt like god was pulling my soul out. Then I had sleep paralysis and saw a shadow figure dancing in the street."
