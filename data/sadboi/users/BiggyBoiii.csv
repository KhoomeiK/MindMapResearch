My ex (god I fucking hate it when I have to mention her as my EX) just recently had her mother pass away from a long battle with pneumonia in July; and she’s only 17. I’m 18 (M). We were together for six years, on and off, and I honestly felt like this most recent time we got back together was the best try yet. We finally got intimate for the first time on Valentine’s Day and I felt so happy. She made me feel amazing and she is a person that I find “indescribable, yet more than perfect.” Her flaws show me that she isn’t perfect, yet they make me love her more. I’m in love with her and I honestly want to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her. But, I’m starting to doubt what she feels for me. We got into a huge fight just a couple weeks ago after we kept going on an emotional roller coaster of staying and breaking up, vice versa. And after she told me she didn’t want to talk to me anymore, I just snapped. I mentally snapped and spewed forth such vile and malicious words towards her on Facebook and blocked her. I thought she hated me for good and I thought we were done for good. Then a sudden epiphany came to my mind; I all but forgot about Instagram. 
I checked a message she had sent to me, and she basically told me that I didn’t know how much she loved me and that I should just block her on there as well. I felt like the scum of the earth, all that weight just came crashing down onto my heart. I felt horrible for what I did (and I still do). I will never be able to forgive myself for that.
We reconnected after I apologized to her, which I was completely surprised to find that she still cared for me. But this is what she told me verbatim: “Right now I just want to be friends.”
My soul and heart hurts from just being friends with her. I want her back so bad. I know that I was the best and still am the best person she’s ever dated. I helped her so much and I just want to continue showing the unending unconditional love that I have for her. But I have this sinking feeling that I fucked everything up and that I won’t be able to get what I had back. I’ve been wanting to die because of that. I just feel like I’m existing, but not being ALIVE. Actually feeling ALIVE. I’ve felt this way for roughly two months. I just want it to end. I just want her back so bad. I love her like nobody else. There’s nobody else that I want to be with but her. She makes me feel ALIVE."

Still listen to this album in entirety to this day and it’s still a banger. Can’t wait for new material from these guys. New material from one of my favorite bands will get me hyped up any day of the week! 🤘🤘"

The person that I was in love with (and still am in love with) just confessed to me last week that she didn’t want me to see her because she felt that she had to put up her best personality in order to make me happy, but I honestly just loved hanging out with her, no matter the scenario. She’s been struggling with depression for the past couple years, but it’s really hit her since July (not going to explain her personal struggles since I feel this would be disrespectful to her) and she just hasn’t been herself. She also confessed to me that she wasn’t feeling the love from me and that she wanted break up for over 8 months, but couldn’t face her real feelings towards me (which I still think is total bs considering her grim situation atm since it’s only making her worse). I feel that I’m at the lowest I’ve ever been in my life right now because we’ve dated for six years on and off. This person makes me so happy, alive and determined to become the best person I can be. I truly believe she is the sole reason I’m still alive today because I love this person unconditionally and I’ve felt that the love between us was growing stronger by the day, especially over these past couple months where she has truly been at her lowest. Every moment that we’ve had together I’ve cherished because I genuinely enjoy spending time with her, just watching movies on Netflix and cuddling and playing games.  I can’t see a future with anybody else besides her and my high school friends have begged me to just burn off the bridges completely with her, but I ignored them and let my rose tinted glasses carry me into some of the best times I’ve had in my life so far. But as the saying goes, “What goes up must come down”: and I’m falling towards rock bottom, maybe oblivion. She says she isn’t in love with me, but I feel her depression is ruining everything around her. For the first time in six years, I truly don’t know if repeatedly going after her was worth the effort. I honestly just want to die because the pain I’m going through is so bad, knowing I’m not going to find anybody more beautiful than her, knowing I’m not going to find anybody as quirky as her, knowing I’m not going to find anybody as fun to be around as her, knowing she is the best of the best...and she says she doesn’t want me. The breakups from before weren’t good, but we managed to reconnect after each time. However, I really just want to fucking die from the pain that I’m feeling right now. I’m going back forth between thinking that I’ll be alright being lonely again to having feelings of hopelessness over what I wasn’t able to do for her. I just want her back so bad, she’s the best thing that I’ve ever had and probably ever will have in my life and the thought that I wasted all my time for a flat out damn lie would destroy me more than anything I could imagine. I’m already wanting to die at this point, but this might honestly push me over the edge. I can’t think of anything positive happening throughout the day other than I can stop faking my emotions when I’m alone. I’m usually an outgoing person, but my coworkers are starting to notice my mood is changing and I don’t want to suffer through this pain anymore."
