LegaladviceGerman,fj0gcjj,t3_famest,1582899304.0,"IANAL, but have had a few battles over utility bills (""Nebenkostenabrechnungen"") with different landlords over the years. Sorry for the lengthy post, but I hope it'll be helpful.

When you move into a flat in Germany, usually a protocol (Übergabeprotokoll) is made listing basically everything that is wrong with the flat and documenting its state. Part of that are meter readings of heating and water from the day of the protocol (They have to check the readings with you there so you can confirm they're correct). Did that happen?

To issue the bill for 2018, the landlord had 1 year time. That's fine, you've received it in September 2019. From the day you've received it, you in return have 1 year time to demand to gain access to the original bills and object to the utility bill (so until September 2020).

The security deposit must be paid back to you within 2 weeks after moving out including interest, UNLESS the landlord has a reasonable expectation of costs that will need to be covered (an outstanding utility bill or damages documented in the protocol made when moving out). In this case the landlord can withhold a PART of the deposit, which will cover those costs.
So, really the landlord can keep 800 EUR for now, but no more than that!

The utility bill you've been issued needs to have an old meter reading (start of billing cycle) and the new meter reading (end of billing cycle, i.e. end of 2018). The old meter reading must match the reading from the protocol made when  you moved in. Is this the case? If not, object to the utility bill on those grounds and demand a recalculation and also demand access to the original bill issued to the landlord by the water company.

If it does match and the amount of water used is merely insane, you should still demand to see the bills and file an objection. In this case you should talk to a lawyer specialised in German rental law as well.

If you would like any more specifics, I'd need to have a look at the bill itself, tbh. This sounds very fishy. Good luck, mate!"

The German law is very clear about when a claim expires. The usual limitation period is 3 years (§ 195 BGB). In certain cases outlined in § 197 BGB the limitation period is 30 years, however, none of these apply in your case.


Now, when someone has a claim and does not know the address of whoever owes him or her money, they can start a so-called ""Mahnverfahren"". This inhibits/freezes the limitation period - but only for a maximum of 10 years, after which the rest of the previously frozen limitation period proceeds.


In your case the claim is 15 years old. Provided that the claim has been rightful in the beginning, it has now expired.


I'd suggest the following:


* write them a letter (DO NOT call them, have everything in writing or nothing they say or promise you has any weight) in which you inform them that their claim has expired. Also let them know that you do not want to be contacted any further regarding this matter, or you will involve the authorities for harassment and fraud.


* please don't accept official letters that are not sent to your actual home address in the future. Just bring them to the post office and tell them that you refuse to accept them (Annahmeverweigerung).


How do I know these things? I've had my fair share dealing with Inkasso and expired claims for myself and friends.

Besides the fact that your former employer is an asshole, who should be publicly shamed, it is actually not that easy to fire someone without notice. Even if it is in the probation period. In this case they should have given you a PAID notice period (usually 2 weeks).


Also, despite the fact that you can fire employees during the probation period without providing a reason, I'm actually not sure if firing someone because of illness is legal.

I've got to be honest with you, BPD is a difficult and tricky disorder and if you think you cannot take care of your niece 100%, you should find a different solution. Keep in mind that a lot people with BPD fear abandonment above all so whatever you decide, be consistent, open and honest with it towards your niece.



Generally, there are a few things that can be done:



- DO NOT let her go back to her parents!!! Under no circumstances must this happen, your niece's parents most likely caused psychological trauma to your niece and going back to potential abusers might result in suicide.
- learn more about BPD
- talk to her and encourage her to do the same (honestly, the more aware she is of her own behaviour, the better!)
- Get her to a psychiatrist, she will need help! Most likely this will involve antipsychotics - Don't fool yourself, the first weeks on those drugs are HARD! Take good care of her and yourself then!
- Get her into DBT - it is a therapy specifically designed for treatment of BPD
- talk, talk and talk! Communication is the key!

So, if I understand correctly, you've made an online purchase from an EU-based company and you yourself are located in the EU as well?


If so, then I've got good news: according to EU regulations, you have the right to retreat from an online purchase contract within 2 weeks. You've got to inform the company in writing though. The reasoning is simple: in a shop, you can have a look at the item, feel the fabric and try it on before making the purchase. When ordering online you cannot do these things, but the law grants this chance to you in the EU. It does not matter what kind of product it is, as long as the original value of the product is not diminished (stains, broken, etc.).


I'd suggest to just inform them that you're using your right to retreat from your contract and wish a full refund, as this is your right. Then you send the item back to them and keep proof of postage.


If they still disagree, you initiate a chargeback, which will not be illegal at that point ;)
