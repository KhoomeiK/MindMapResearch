Instead, Anderson threw for 310 yards and we won 35-14, an absolute beatdown. I saw so many Giants fans being escorted out with blood on their jerseys followed by cheering Browns fans in handcuffs.

Christianity,fjktl06,t3_fduazj,1583433635.0,"You're not alone. My wife and I have gone through this twice, and I have presided at the funeral of stillborn children. Two things I have learned are: 1. Grief is normal and ok. I know that some people don't experience the same grief with miscarriages, but for others the moment you receive a positive pregnancy test (let alone start thinking of names, decorating the nursery), that is a very real child you begin to love. Losing them hurts, even when you've never seen their face. Never be ashamed of your grief. And 2. I believe that God does not cause this kind of pain. He didn't ""need another angel"" or anything like that. But God DOES redeem our pain. I cannot count how many mothers and families who have lost children in this way that I have had a chance to minister to. It almost felt like we were a magnet for them. In the midst of our own pain and grief, my wife and I have been able to empathize with them in a way we could not have before. I pray God redeems your situation as well, and it sounds like the healing is already beginning!"

Pedos and violent extremists are a small minority that make us all seem like monsters. So many have done so much good for others, and it gets lumped in with the lunatics. In just my church, we have built houses for the less fortunate, done a ton of counseling for those with mental illness, and found ways to give hope and belonging to the lonely and despairing.

AskReddit,fititjd,t3_f9kd1v,1582721376.0,"Grew up on a farm, one day at was helping load a steer into a trailer. After coming out of its pen, there is a long hallway only as wide as the steer so it can’t turn around, and an open trailer at the end. This particular steer was a pain and wouldn’t leave its pen. Finally it bolted and ran down the hallway into the trailer. I sprinted after it to shut the trailer door, but before I couldn’t get there it had turned around while inside the trailer and came sprinting back out. I was in the hallway with nowhere to go, so I just squeezed myself against the wall. The steer got to me and started to push past. As it pressed me against the wall I heard cracking and was sure my rib cage was being crushed. Instead, I broke through the plywood wall I was being pressed against. After I had collected myself, we eventually got the steer in the trailer. Those steaks were delicious."
