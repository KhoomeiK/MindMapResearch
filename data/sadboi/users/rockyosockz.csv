Make sure you bug them after your aid comes out, because half the time they don't really bother looking too closely at FAFSA even with a significant change in circumstances, and you need to actually petition them to reassess it. It isn't always automatic."
RPI,fod2tpw,t3_g6sz32,1587679141.0,"They've increased it from [$2250 per credit](http://finance.rpi.edu/update.do?artcenterkey=79) to ~~$2350 (iirc, I asked a dean this a few days ago)~~ $2320 per credit now. For aid, your aid decreases if you're part time. The lowest I've taken was 5 credits, which caused most of my financial aid to scale down significantly - but that was because of the way my finaid grants and scholarships were written. Some actually completely go away if you're part time. Some stay the same as a full time student. 

Word of warning just so you're aware, because no one told me this: under 6 credits, you're ineligible for most student / on campus jobs. 

Your best best is talking to Financial Aid directly (finaid@rpi.edu) and asking for a full statement if / when you register for this class. They'll take a while and recalculate it for you so you have the full number you're expected to pay for the class and graduation.

Edit: Apparently it's still [pending board approval but it's $2320 on the website under Fees and Refunds](https://info.rpi.edu/bursar/payment/#FeesandRefunds)."
RPI,fmjkkl9,t3_fvkipd,1586132184.0,"It's not too different than real life, except we have team meetings online instead of in person. Capstone is highly dependent on your groups project and your own dynamics within your group, but as one of those groups who were about to start prototyping, we've moved entirely onto simulations and CAD instead of what we were going to try and manufacture and test. It's a little easier honestly than having to coordinate buying a bunch of stuff and time to work in a shop to make things. But asking questions and seeking in person help for those simulations is nonexistent, so that's a big drawback. 

Still have weekly meetings, and sponsor meetings, those haven't changed. Assignments are done and submitted using what's called the Electronic Design Notebook (EDN) and a repository from the very beginning, which I personally don't like all that much, but it's good enough for what we need. We have not been able to use Google drive which is universally not allowed in RPI's Capstone (from what I can tell, correct me if other sections are allowed.) EDN is just like an old school forum setup, nothing flashy, with a Gantt chart built in and some other features. I mostly don't like the bugginess but it's livable and that's just a personal preference. 

It's not ideal, like most classes, but it's still doable for the time being. Long term it'd probably need to be restructured if it stayed online, but for now, it's not the worst class. I'm more upset about my labs getting cancelled for a different class since that was the bulk of the grade and now other things are weighted more."

RPI,fk2q3l4,t3_fg5w96,1583806562.0,"Hi! I hang out with the Rensselaer Bird Center and have two birds of my own.

 
I'd really caution you to give the birds to the center to re-home instead of a random person on Reddit so that this does not happen to them again. They can match the personalities better most likely with current owners. Rehoming is hard on all animals and unfortunately birds are very prone to it :( 

Teena and Lisa are wonderful to deal with, and I personally can vouch for how well taken care of they will be. One of my birds is a re-home through them. 

I'm there nearly every week if you need help transporting. Give them a call, their number is 5184329674."

I had a similar issue and was able to talk them into extending my medal, but the caveat was that I also had some very extenuating circumstances to back that up and for the school to be sympathetic towards."

What I can say is that working with ALAC / FYE / DOSO will only help your case. If you're showing you're trying, they're much more likely to be willing to help you stay another semester to try and get your stuff together and pass. But at this point, it's worth weighing whether or not you think that's possible overall. Talk to every professor. Go to office hours. Go to counseling. Get all the help you can. You can sometimes appeal for W's (late withdrawals) or I's (incompletes). W's if I recall correctly will be on your transcript but will not affect your GPA. I's count as F's BUT will be removed if you complete the coursework within a semester or year, depending what you, the Dean, and your professor work out.


Getting kicked out is not the end of the world. I know it feels like that, but it's not. Your parents will still love you. Your friends will still be here. The school might not be the right fit and that's okay. 


If you are let go for a semester, do everything you can to address what the issues you found were. Take classes. Get help where you think you need it. Try to figure out what happened. 


Either way, good luck. There are definitely people who have stayed with a horrendously bad semester. Some have not. But continuing to work hard and seek help will only help you in the long run. You will get through it."
