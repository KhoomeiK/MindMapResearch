stepparents,fqvxaon,t3_gl2gwb,1589687310.0,"YES YES YES YES YES, a million times yes! My SO had a friendly relationship with his BM, and she would randomly text him asking things that were none of her business and he would give her info like it was nothing, because he was used to it considering they were married for so long. I had a lot of jealousy in our relationship for a very very long time, but this wasn’t even jealousy, this just felt plain weird to me. Why does she need to know if you’re at a specific restaurant because she drove by and thought she saw your vehicle? Why does she need to know how your visit with your long-lost dad went? She doesn’t need to. It was a constant issue that he saw as jealousy but it was not jealousy, it was just so strange and just not normal to me, and his response was always “I don’t feel that I’m normal” or “why is not normal not good?” “Why do we have to be normal?” 

Made no sense then and still makes no sense to me now even though he’s finally ended all of that because, after a YEAR of me being uncomfortable, he finally thought of it from my point of view. 

I can’t explain it. Never had the words for it until you posted this and I thank you for it."

They never worked on their marriage. Everything was about me and my stepsister and half sister. When my step sister and I both moved out, my mom was a wreck and she and my stepdad fought constantly, because they don’t know how to be around each other. They don’t know what a marriage looks like because they’ve never tried to focus on one. They only focused on us. Fast forward to my half sister getting older and now she and my mom are best friends. If my sister ever did leave, I’d pretty much guarantee that my parents would end up divorcing."

Anxiety,flzcli5,t3_frslfn,1585620522.0,"I have been this way for as long as I can remember. I constantly think my friends and my spouse are angry at me, even though they absolutely aren’t. It’s been a really troubling issue that I possess. It was a giant factor in the ending of my engagement. He told me if I ever need reassurance, just ask and he will give it to me. I asked too much. He eventually couldn’t take it. 
I always am paranoid and worried that people are angry with me and question it and question it until it gets so annoying that they don’t want to be around me. 

I wish I knew how to fix this. Luckily I started therapy last week for the first time since I was a child, and I’m hoping I can work through this. I get where you’re coming from, and with help, hopefully it will get better."

stepparents,flpxr1x,t3_fq5qsf,1585371971.0,"I’m so glad it is working out for you! I was in the same spot. We had quite a few other problems, but one of my main issues was that SO didn’t parent his kids. They’d leave food out for days, dishes piled high, spilled drinks all over the floor, food crushed into the couch, etc. I tried to talk to him about it multiple times, and he’d always say he would be on it from then on. But never was. So I had my last straw and stopped cleaning up their shit. Now, I have my own daughter, and she is 6. His kids are 10 and 11. My daughter ALWAYS cleans up after herself because she was raised that way. She does not leave a mess anywhere she goes. But SO’s kids, I’d give them a parade if I watched them even take their plate to the sink after dinner. 

Didn’t work out well for me. I was viewed to him as judging his parenting (which I was) and disrespecting how he raises them. It led to him ultimately not respecting me and basically not wanting to be around me at all to the point where I left about a week ago.

Now, my new house is sparkling clean. It looks great, it smells great, my daughter and I are going to be happy after this small adjustment period. But I know I don’t have to put up with anyone’s messes anymore and looked at like friggin Hitler just by asking them to clean up their mess."

stepparents,fisurv1,t3_f9lqzu,1582693967.0,"I would like to reiterate that I do not believe he is going to cheat on me. Do I worry about it? Yes, extremely often. My anxiety has gotten the best of me. But in my heart I don’t entirely believe he would cheat on me with her as he has made it very clear that he has no feelings for her whatsoever and simply just wants to coparent, even though I don’t understand his methods. But that’s not my true worry. My true worry is that him spending time with her alone will have her start to manipulate him into including more time with them co-parenting their kids and pushing me out of the co-parenting picture, as she doesn’t seem to like me being around and has made it very clear several times. She wants them to parent their kids and doesn’t want me to even slightly be a parent to them, so she wants to do things alone with him and their kids. I know in my heart that he doesn’t have romantic or sexual feelings towards his ex wife, but there’s still a connection there unfortunately, and I don’t know how to deal with it."
stepparents,fishdmx,t1_fisf9t8,1582684859.0,"I do truly believe he is over her, but my concern is that she is extremely manipulative and being married to her for 12 years, she knows how to get in his head. I don’t believe she is over him, no matter how often she flaunts her new BF on social media and talks about how much she loves him. I’m worried if they’re alone together, she will slowly manipulate him into doing something stupid. And by stupid, I don’t mean cheat on me, but just find another way to keep me farther away so they can co-parent without me, as she really is not okay with me being around, even though we are civil and she has her own BF. She talks bad about me constantly to their kids, and one of them is a teenager who absolutely loves me and has a horrible relationship with her mom, and she always tells me everything her mom says about me, which I have asked her to stop plenty of times because I don’t want to hear it. 

He is so blind when it comes to his ex wife’s actions and always believes she’s being honest and sincere, when in reality, she always seems to have another agenda."

He literally could not fathom what I was talking about. She is an extremely narcissistic person, and she emotionally abused and manipulated him for 12 years, and he still doesn’t seem to understand how a healthy relationship works. I try to keep that in mind and explain it to him, but he just literally doesn’t seem to be able to fathom it."
