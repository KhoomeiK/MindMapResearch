SaltLakeCity,fn2hm1f,t1_fn2f0pm,1586589312.0,"I have not heard anyone getting pulled over who are entering the SLC area, just heading north. My coworkers had to show proof they were essential employees."
SaltLakeCity,fn2euuj,t3_fyxwqi,1586586562.0,I’ve had 2 coworkers tell me they have been pulled over this past week. All heading north to Ogden at around 12am.
SaltLakeCity,fktzssr,t1_fktys80,1584538992.0,"Cry. Lol, but in all seriousness, if any of this has taught me anything it’s that I’m not prepared for any kind of emergency. Not enough food or supplies. Kinda scary."
SaltLakeCity,fktyiis,t3_fkpd33,1584538079.0,Sugar House here. I thought I was hallucinating. Really freaky. I’m from California and I’ve never felt one that big before
SaltLakeCity,fktyd96,t3_fkpd37,1584537975.0,Yeppers. 5.7 magnitude
SaltLakeCity,fkty053,t1_fktxyiw,1584537713.0,Berkley says 5.7 magnitude
SaltLakeCity,fktxyvu,t3_fkpe7q,1584537686.0,So freaking scary. Bigger than ones I’ve felt in California
Instagramreality,fj320cb,t1_fj2y1nx,1582963335.0,I’m right there with you. My foot and wait are the same length. I agree the foot-to-waist measurement probably isn’t the most reliable
mentalhealthmemes,fi9dk8f,t3_f738i9,1582262347.0,"Lol omg, had this conversation with my psychiatrist so many time. This is hilarious to me"
nextfuckinglevel,fhofp5g,t1_fhody5u,1581754326.0,Goddamn you
blunderyears,fhk3pdg,t1_fhj0t6m,1581665444.0,There is still time! Go be a model. Glad to know I wasn’t the only one. We need to hit ALL the phases in order to fully level up
blunderyears,fhk3mv7,t1_fhj0j1r,1581665356.0,"Samsies. I honestly miss MySpace so much lol. It was (for some reason) the best way to express myself. And no, unfortunately I do not dance much in real life on account of sucking at it."
blunderyears,fhgrj5s,t1_fhaar2q,1581576248.0,"Just did a bunch of dance moves to the rest of the song playing in my head. 

My fave was always posting Chiodos lyrics on my Facebook page (cause those were the only posts that got anyone’s attention lol)."

blunderyears,ff112g6,t1_feyzqfp,1579474191.0,"Lol, adulthood is a crazy thing"
Instagramreality,fecks15,t1_fec7ktt,1578976335.0,I didn’t even notice the difference in color! I was too distracted by everything else lol
Instagramreality,febrzvz,t1_febk0ge,1578961999.0,I agree 100%. Seeing her in the video motivates me more to get into shape than seeing such an unrealistic version of a person like her on the right. It’s like my mind knows it’s unobtainable so I don’t even want to try.
Instagramreality,febe8pv,t1_febdbdn,1578957943.0,"I know :( makes me so sad. She’s so gorgeous, there is no need for photoshop."
Instagramreality,feaxw6q,t1_feawlx8,1578953349.0,"That’s alright, you gotta zoom in really close. It’s really subtle, it’s a good photoshop job. I would have never noticed it if I didn’t spend so much time on this sub learning where to look"
Instagramreality,feav9o4,t1_feauzex,1578952513.0,"I have SO many examples from this chick’s page. I just don’t want to spam this subreddit with her photos. She has hundreds of thousands of followers, blue check mark and everything. She’s also nearly 40 with two kids."
Instagramreality,feaur7e,t1_feaumb9,1578952356.0,"Warped around her butt, mostly obvious on the top of the butt. Robe is bending weird"

Instagramreality,featvcp,t1_fearnze,1578952169.0,"Every single photo it’s super obvious that she photoshops her waist to oblivion. That was the only video on her whole page, I’m assuming because it would make is really obvious that she’s editing her photos."
schizophrenia,fe66mb4,t1_fe666mq,1578882958.0,"Also, when you learn about my illness/diagnosis, please don’t just stare at me and look me up and down and say something along the lines of “but you don’t look crazy?” Or “but you’re too normal looking to be schizophrenic.” That shit stings the soul."
schizophrenia,fe666mq,t3_ennhtt,1578882679.0,"I’m not stuck-up. Most people find me intimidating because I talk so monotone and never smile or laugh. It’s not intentional. The thing is, I’m convinced everyone already hates me so when you invite me to hang out, I stay home instead. The aching I feel for human connection is unbearable at times, but I don’t know how to maintain friendships or relationships anymore. It would just feel forced and fake. The isolation and loneliness I feel as a result of this illness is just as debilitating as the other symptoms I have. 

Please keep inviting me to hang out, even though I always say no or bail. It helps me feel more human and cared for than you realize."
blunderyears,fe0gehl,t1_fe0bm6p,1578813015.0,"I agree completely. I think it was a sad attempt of trying to get my parents’ attention as I was pretty troubled at the time. Needless to say, it didn’t work."
blunderyears,fdg5i0y,t1_fdg15nu,1578380824.0,"Oh same here, I still wear men’s Vans hightop skate shoes every day and play video games. Tomboys are awesome! Don’t ever change, be you"
Instagramreality,fd4lbbx,t1_fd4j6kq,1578168580.0,"Damn. That was actually really deep. I’m gonna have to really sit and think about this for a while now, how sad."
blunderyears,fczc98p,t1_fcxq3cx,1578098018.0,Wow thank you for the compliment! So nice of you

blunderyears,fbe1uvi,t1_fbdhcey,1576776343.0,Definitely not Hailey. But it is a pretty name.
blunderyears,fbbep4y,t1_fbafytb,1576698887.0,At least you can look at the bright side lol
blunderyears,fba2skh,t1_fb9uz3m,1576661503.0,"Sacramento is the worst, in my opinion. You from Cali?"
blunderyears,fb8whce,t1_fb8t81n,1576623485.0,I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated.
blunderyears,fb85ikw,t1_fb7xdz6,1576606604.0,"I agree. The joys of always looking pissed off. The worst part is, I actively try to smile more, and I feel like it just looks weird because it isn’t genuine. I hate that."
blunderyears,fb85cb4,t1_fb7yc0p,1576606495.0,"Hey, thanks!"
blunderyears,fb7wr3q,t1_fb7ffoa,1576601111.0,Happens ALL the time. What I usually get is “I used to be so intimidated by you and I thought you were a bitch. You’re actually really fun and goofy.” I never know how to take that.
blunderyears,fb6wow4,t1_fb6vw18,1576563217.0,"Honestly, I don’t even know. I didn’t know then, and I don’t know now."
blunderyears,fb6lea9,t1_fb6l487,1576553167.0,Good point! I feel. That makes sense
blunderyears,fb6lbx9,t1_fb6kqtd,1576553122.0,Thanks!
blunderyears,fb6kf5l,t1_fb6k94m,1576552474.0,"We would call people a poser unless they could at least Ollie. But we weren’t jerks about it. We would teach them how and then they wouldn’t be a poser anymore. No one knows immediately how to Ollie, so yeah, we were all posers at some point lol"
blunderyears,fb6kaex,t1_fb6ju10,1576552382.0,Haha thanks! I’m sure we would have
blunderyears,fb6jnt3,t1_fb6jgoe,1576551940.0,"It was in California, yes. Not SoCal, though"

blunderyears,fb6irut,t1_fb6in05,1576551315.0,"That’s fair. I suppose by “poser”, I meant that no one is immediately a pro at anything. Everyone sucks to some extent until they get good"
blunderyears,fb6hrdc,t1_fb4k9c3,1576550584.0,Good explanation!
blunderyears,fb6hneb,t1_fb3sb2x,1576550506.0,I concur
blunderyears,fb6h8qb,t1_fb6gla2,1576550228.0,I agree 100% with the jack of all trades idea. I think it means you’re well-rounded
blunderyears,fb6fj13,t1_fb6ev6p,1576549014.0,I too have the glorious RBF. I feel like we have similar personalities
blunderyears,fb6egpu,t1_fb6dasi,1576548267.0,"That’s such a good idea to just buy the whole outfit off a mannequin. My problem is, my frame is difficult to dress. Long legs, torso, and arms. I feel like the stuff I look up online doesn’t look good on me. Guess I’ll have to keep practicing. Fashion is more difficult than it looks"
blunderyears,fb6eb1s,t1_fb6b2fe,1576548156.0,Everyone is a poser at some point
blunderyears,fb6awss,t1_fb43uw6,1576545777.0,I wish I thought so. Thank you
blunderyears,fb6avih,t1_fb6atvt,1576545751.0,We must be soul friends then. Hi friend
blunderyears,fb6astd,t1_fb6agq3,1576545698.0,"Yep, not sure what possessed me to tie a shoelace around my head, but here we are."
blunderyears,fb6aqqs,t1_fb6a0o9,1576545657.0,"Oh lord, hopefully I’m never in THAT phase. Na, I’m a poor full time student and I work full time. So I wear whatever is cheap and fits me."

blunderyears,fb6anrg,t1_fb4o4je,1576545597.0,A few people have asked. I’m debating
blunderyears,fb6amfy,t1_fb4jkn9,1576545569.0,"Yeah, I was getting upset at how much I was getting cat-called while skating around town so I tried to look as boyish as possible. Then that look spilled over into my day-to-day life."
blunderyears,fb6ajol,t1_fb4h0i6,1576545512.0,I sure hope not
blunderyears,fb6ai3r,t1_fb4gvpi,1576545480.0,"Hopefully they will be able to learn from my mistakes

Edit: words are difficult"
blunderyears,fb6ah1j,t1_fb4gni2,1576545459.0,I am yet to discover fashion. Pls halp
blunderyears,fb6afjy,t1_fb4gbef,1576545430.0,You’re not wrong. Even to this day people get confused about whether I’m early 20’s or early 30’s.
blunderyears,fb6adgb,t1_fb4fcjw,1576545387.0,"Well then, double thank you"
blunderyears,fb6acp3,t1_fb4ddg7,1576545373.0,That’s what I hear.
blunderyears,fb6abyy,t1_fb4cw3o,1576545357.0,"Definitely still got some skater and scene vibes I like to think. I spent most of my life as one of those two. I don’t think anyone who met me as an adult would catch on, except that you can still see the holes of my snakebite piercings and I wear high top vans every day."
blunderyears,fb6a7fj,t1_fb4bln9,1576545266.0,"Thankfully, no. I should have had a red neck phase, luckily I skipped that one"

blunderyears,fb6a3qr,t1_fb47w0r,1576545194.0,Love this. Stealing this to tell my posterity.
blunderyears,fb6a2vl,t1_fb475ik,1576545176.0,"I’d like to think so. But I think the reality is no matter what I did, no one cared enough to ask if I was okay - which I wasn’t"
blunderyears,fb6a0jw,t1_fb46tqq,1576545131.0,"For a short time in LA, yes. It was a great experience"
blunderyears,fb69zov,t1_fb469pq,1576545114.0,I think we are all equally as confused and impressed at this point. I don’t even know anymore
blunderyears,fb69y43,t1_fb4hjjn,1576545084.0,True.
blunderyears,fb69xq1,t1_fb44s6w,1576545076.0,I’ll be proud then
blunderyears,fb69wau,t1_fb69hfu,1576545047.0,I had to hide that tape. My parents thought it was devil music haha. If only they knew the stuff listened to in high school. It’s the shoe lace on my head that gets me
blunderyears,fb69t0v,t1_fb68ru5,1576544979.0,"It’s been a while since I’ve seen the show, I’m more of an Office person. But yeah, perhaps her character is secretly based off me"

blunderyears,fb69mwq,t1_fb56fvx,1576544855.0,Oh jeez. If only I had access to my Myspace profile and friend list with all the old photos I do would be tempted to show you guys. I was literally mirroring them.
blunderyears,fb69kuf,t1_fb56at5,1576544813.0,"Of all of my phases, that one is by far the one I cringe at the most"
blunderyears,fb69j8t,t1_fb55zvg,1576544781.0,"No, friend. I rode regular with my foot at an angle for optimal Ollie opportunities. I can’t skate vert to save my life, but street tricks are what I like to do"
blunderyears,fb69fbr,t1_fb555hn,1576544703.0,Um..... yes. The cringe is real
blunderyears,fb69dth,t1_fb54en7,1576544673.0,"Probably one of the best compliments I’ve ever gotten, to be honest"
blunderyears,fb69cbf,t1_fb5458y,1576544643.0,"Na, there are people I know who never went through phases. These were the popular kids - cheerleaders and jocks. Even to this day they seem the same"
blunderyears,fb69a28,t1_fb53dnt,1576544597.0,I was quirky from what I’ve been told. But people were also afraid of me for some reason
blunderyears,fb698l4,t1_fb51bg2,1576544567.0,Yeahhhh. It was a favorite accessory. It was a mix tape I made when I was 8. Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys. Waiting to time hitting record when the songs would play on the radio was such a struggle.
blunderyears,fb69494,t1_fb515hq,1576544478.0,"At the time I liked to think I made up my own fads, but that’s clearly not the case. I’m in the adulting fad now"
blunderyears,fb692cq,t1_fb508yu,1576544440.0,Not at all. It always smelled like fresh cut grass and guys with dad bods BBQing
blunderyears,fb68zud,t1_fb4ya15,1576544390.0,‘Tis the truth
blunderyears,fb68yhm,t1_fb53ej7,1576544362.0,"They thing about trauma in my experience, is that not everyone is willing to open up and talk about it. Especially they people from the generation before me. I didn’t start talking about my trauma at all until about three years ago. If I could have carried on with my life without it disrupting things, I probably would have never brought it up. And even then, only one or two people in my life know about my trauma. Just because you know your friends well, it might not mean they have told you about some deep dark stuff they have been through. Or maybe they have already worked through it. Trauma is a tricky thing."
blunderyears,fb68rdv,t1_fb5108r,1576544218.0,"This is so true. Everyone thought my family was perfect. I was outwardly screaming for help without even realizing it, and yet no one saw or cared to jump in and help. It’s really scary how much parents can screw up their kids. I think if I had an adult to talk to things would have been different."
