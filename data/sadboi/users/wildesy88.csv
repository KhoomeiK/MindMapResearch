AskWomen,fqs3v55,t3_gkgvlg,1589597920.0,"I’m 32 this year. People mistake me for anywhere between 21-27.

I’m flattered. I’m not very attractive. 

I sometimes wonder it’s because I don’t have children. Not having kids drain the life out of me must have kept me looking okay all these years. 

I work with people younger than me that have kids and some days they come in and they look horrible. They look much older than what they really are."

If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. 

I had to read that one a few times before I got it.

My Aunty told me as a teen. The world does not stop turning just because you have a broken heart from a death in the family. 

That one sticks out to me because my mum doesn’t know how to deal with grief and I didn’t know how to deal with this for a long time."

ChoosingBeggars,fpfwrb7,t3_gcwyzl,1588586434.0,"I was having lunch one day before work. I sat next to a guy who looked as though he was struggling a bit. I offered to buy him lunch. I decided I was going to splurge on his meal had he taken me up on my offer. He then replies to me no, but I will have some alcohol because I don’t have an ID to buy any. The actual nerve of some people."

Psychosis,fpfnmkx,t3_gd5ekm,1588576989.0,All of my episodes started from meth use. I thought I could use weed because in my mind weed ‘wasn’t as strong as meth’ I was so wrong. I then only tried drinking alcohol but would still have psychotic episodes. I’ve had to give up drugs and alcohol for my mental wellbeing. Best decision I’ve made on my path to a healthier life.
Psychosis,fp1ilss,t3_gaipng,1588236775.0,"I was diagnosed as drug induced psychosis. 

As the years went on, drug use ended but the episodes did not.

I got frustrated with the doctors and asked what it is I have if drug use is no longer happening.

My diagnosis changed to schizophrenia instead."

Obviously it’s not going to end well. When it all comes crashing down she will need all the support she can get."
AskWomen,fmvyx72,t3_fxcvcf,1586435363.0,I used to earn over 100k/yr. I was young and naive. I thought he really loved me. The more I look back on it over the years I really think he only ever wanted to be with me because of the money. Over the course of our relationship I probably spent maybe 50k on him.
