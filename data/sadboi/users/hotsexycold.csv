Blogging,folsv06,t3_g86ma2,1587869676.0,"I don‚Äôt have any experience on this topic but I feel like a humor blog would be refreshing to scroll through during this crazy stressful time we‚Äôre all going through. Maybe you could write humorous articles about current events, things related to the pandemic, being quarantined, politics, the fight for toilet paper at the grocery store, etc. Kind of like how SNL writes skits that correlate with current events. 

And then also sell the art prints on the website."
BPD,fn69j6r,t1_fn5s88d,1586692582.0,"Yep that sounds impulsive to me! Remember everyone is different and experiences this symptom in different ways and to different degrees. For me, the level of impulsivity fluctuates depending on how well I‚Äôm coping at that time."
BPD,fjzafg8,t3_ffkvij,1583715108.0,Who is the intended recipient of this message?
BPD,fjyzd0a,t3_ffh74t,1583707859.0,"Call someone and talk about it. Watch a funny movie. Exercise. Start writing a list of goals and steps to achieve them. Volunteer. 

Or just ride the wave and know that this too shall pass. These feelings are temporary. Imagine the sadness making you stronger and believe that tomorrow will be better."
limerence,fjxwmpt,t1_fjni99u,1583685041.0,You are spot on. I wonder what personality types are prone to limerence. Like what is it about me that makes me susceptible to this type of obsession?
limerence,fjxwcwy,t1_fjmy2dw,1583684870.0,"I‚Äôve known him for a few years, limerent for about a year. I‚Äôm trying the whole NC thing. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs going to work. I still think about him constantly and I get bummed out as the days pass and he doesn‚Äôt contact me. You‚Äôd think this would be enough of a sign to allow me to move on...but nope."
limerence,fjxw007,t1_fjn7y9q,1583684638.0,This definitely speaks to me. Thank you. üôèüèª
mentalillness,fjlytv4,t3_fdy4hy,1583457651.0,"Life is not bullshit. You are an incredible person with limitless potential. The problem is your mind is sick. Your mind has distorted your perception of yourself and the world around you. Imagine if a blind person denied colors existed simply because they couldn‚Äôt see them. 

Your mind (yes, yours) is capable of experiencing unimaginable joy, gratitude, hope, love. The journey to unlocking its potential sometimes includes years of therapy and/or medication. It is worth it. You are worth it.

Seek volunteer opportunities in your community, join a church (if that‚Äôs your thing). Get social and give back. Human connection is the purpose of life. Someone out there needs your help."
BPD,fh0vjur,t3_f100id,1581207979.0,I‚Äôve been searching for ‚Äúhome‚Äù my whole life. üòû
BPD,fgq1c7u,t3_eztrff,1581016001.0,"Everyone is loveable. Whether you allow yourself to receive love from others is a different story. Your low self-esteem will prevent you from allowing yourself to be loved. 

Work on bettering yourself physically and emotionally so that when someone does fall in love with you, you can properly handle those feelings. 

Everyone is loveable."
BPD,fgp3s7e,t3_ezpckm,1580996073.0,"BPD does not mean you are unlovable. In my experience, everyone has their own flavor of crazy. 

At least you‚Äôve identified yours and can work towards bettering yourself. 

The feeling of worthlessness is a symptom.  Do not believe it. Seek therapy and work on your self-esteem."
BPD,fgp3hie,t3_ezpf7g,1580995843.0,DM me if you wanna chat.
BPD,fgolxvz,t1_fgnb6tj,1580975256.0,I also did not know there was a name for it. Even some songs have a very quick pattern that drives me insane.
BPD,fgollvd,t3_ezmsql,1580974836.0,"Sometimes it helps to walk away and not react right away. Spend a day quietly reflecting.  Sleep on it. Go for a long walk. Listen to relaxing music. Meditate. Take a bubble bath and watch a good movie, whatever will relax you and take your mind off it for a bit. 

Chances are when you revisit the problem, your emotions towards it will have lessened, thus allowing you to make more clear decisions."
BPD,fgokbyq,t1_fgntcur,1580973272.0,"I think the problem is that we care too much what other people think. Reaching out to connect with others has become more about seeking validation than making friends. 

We have an over-preoccupation with imagining what people are thinking about us and trying to control their perceptions. The truth is, most people don‚Äôt think of us as ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù and their response to us likely has more to do with them than it does us. 

We need to stop seeking approval from others and work on building our self-esteem. I know it‚Äôs easier said than done, but worth a shot to get started. I‚Äôm over letting other people send my mood into a downward spiral. This is no way to live. 

Good luck to you."
BPD,fgnr7zy,t3_ezf64q,1580951111.0,"I‚Äôm so bad about this that I‚Äôve recently started isolating myself. I‚Äôd rather suffer alone than to send a text and get left on read. I can‚Äôt handle that rejection (even as insignificant as I know it is). 

Every now and then when I‚Äôve been drinking, I‚Äôll send random people texts and then I wake up the next morning and immediately delete everything. Even if they responded, I feel so embarrassed no matter what I may have texted. 

How do we fix this?"
limerence,ffj802x,t3_etux9p,1579992663.0,"I have struggled my whole life with BPD and limerence. 

Idealization, unstable sense of self, fear of abandonment, intense emotions that change quickly over seemingly normal events... all traits I show towards LO. 

BPD affects my whole life, but the person I‚Äôm idealizing (LO) usually seems to take the brunt of the mood storms. 

I think borderlines are more susceptible to limerence, but limerence alone isn‚Äôt a BPD diagnosis."
limerence,fai3rjz,t3_e9ctne,1576099235.0,I‚Äôm gonna save this! Thank you üôèüèª
limerence,fadht9d,t1_fadcrcg,1575972312.0,This makes a lot of sense and is generally how I live my life. Problem is when you have the potential to hurt loved ones and/or make yourself look like a complete psychopath all for the sake of chasing a high.
limerence,fadhrao,t1_faddrg9,1575972229.0,I don‚Äôt think I could resist. I wish this would happen because then I would probably get over him. Chase won. Hopefully I‚Äôd get a few months of freedom before the next comes along.
limerence,f3fxqug,t3_dgyh2c,1570904412.0,Therapy can help tremendously. I highly recommend it.
adultery,f09j5rc,t1_f08nq25,1568502386.0,"Yeah, I am jealous. She has what I want and I‚Äôm pissed. I‚Äôm not normally the jealous type. I definitely need to work on myself and forget about this guy."
adultery,f09injx,t1_f09ibzz,1568502066.0,I agree. Easier said than done but I will work on it.
adultery,ezukv0f,t3_d2evnu,1568154612.0,"Intermittent reinforcement. Best trick in the book. DO NOT CONTACT HIM. Either he will start wondering and worrying why he isn‚Äôt hearing from you (and in the process realize his feelings towards you) or he won‚Äôt and you‚Äôll know he isn‚Äôt into you and you can ditch him. 

Nothing good will come from you contacting him first. Wait wait wait. You will be so glad you did."

adultery,ezrojqo,t3_d1zdb3,1568076673.0,Don‚Äôt do it! Forget him. Move on. Get him out of your head.
adultery,eyqc1eu,t1_eyplbwa,1567336670.0,"It does sound like limerence. No contact is not possible as long as we work together. I can go a few days with minimal contact but inevitably we will be required to work together on a project again. Some days I only see him in passing, others it‚Äôs more often than that. We keep things very platonic, never talking about anything inappropriate, making sure we are never alone in a room. If we are speaking privately in a hallway, we make the conversation short as the chemistry is so intense that I can‚Äôt even face it. 

I just want the feelings to go away. But it‚Äôs been 2 years and they‚Äôre only getting stronger."
