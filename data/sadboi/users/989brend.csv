relationships,ezehvmk,t1_ezefd36,1567864133.0,"By the way.. the fact that you have posted on here looking for help tells me a couple things, You are highly intelligent for a 15 year old and you are obviously extremely mature.  Don't let this get you down! You are doing the right thing and your dad is so lucky to have you. Don't apologize for this being a ""darker"" subject.  You dont need to apologize for anything since you're 15 years old and never asked to be dealing with this issue. If ever need anything dont hesitate to message me. I have lived through all of this and would be happy to offer some advice. Keep your chin up buddy you guys will all be okay."
relationships,ezeh7s1,t1_ezds9st,1567863891.0,This is so correct!
relationships,ezegkta,t1_ezdsjei,1567863613.0,"This is so correct.  I can tell we have both lived through it. You are doing the right thing! You are still a CHILD and should not have to deal with this kind of responsibility but life is not easy and it certainly is not fair. You need to make the best of this situation and seek the proper help. The sooner you do the better. I felt like I had betrayed my father but I assure you you need to get help and stick with it. Al anon, and any help you can get."
relationships,ezefd36,t3_d0s7sm,1567863174.0,"My dad was an alcoholic growing up too and I feel like It definitely destroyed my family.  I'm not sure what kind of relationship you have with your father but if you guys are close you really need to tell him how you feel and beg him to put you before the alcohol because i will guarantee it will completely destroy your lives. I am not coming down on your dad because most people with such problems have a high amount of trauma in their lives (early years,PTSD etc...) so I think its important to greet him with compassion at first. Although sometimes the nice way doesn't work at all... a 6 pack a day isnt worth ruining your life over and I'm really sorry your going through this. Tell your dad the truth. The earlier he knows the reality the better at this point. He is probably a really good guy going through his own inner demons. It doesn't take long to throw your entire life away."
ptsd,eyptwnp,t3_cn1cr1,1567311164.0,I'm so used to living in misery that when I find myself laughing I actually feel guilty.  Its really weird but it happens all the time.
canadaguns,ewc75v2,t3_cnej2j,1565279437.0,"Great choice! Thats a perfect first gun. You should check out the girsan mc28 sa. They are on sale for $279.00 at tenda Canada.  It's an unbelievable bargain.  The only reason they are that inexpensive is because the turkish currency lost so much value. It does not shoot like like a ""cheap"" gun. I dont work for them haha just fell in love with mine."
canadaguns,ewc53pw,t1_ew9tvjo,1565278242.0,Good for you! Today is a great day then! I wish you all the best and hope you enjoy that AR as much as the delicious pizza you ordered lol.
Business_Ideas,es28ik6,t1_es26u2v,1561516771.0,That's the million dollar question lol. If you can think of something that would sell and is cheap to make you have a great business potential. Start with something you use in every day life or some kind of current trend. Look up the most popular products on Amazon and see if you could replicate something with your 3d printer Etc...think outside of the box. It's not supposed to be easy or everyone would do it. Keep track of you expenses from the start.
Business_Ideas,es21czn,t3_c2g0ar,1561511302.0,Find something to manufacture. Do small projects on the side. You could start an odd jobs company. That way you control the hours and you can pick and choose the times you accept your contracts. People are 100% okay with grounds Maintenance and odd jobs being completed on the weekends since they are home to watch over the project.  Read books on basic Maintenance to gain knowledge.  It is a really easy business to schedule around your full time job and better yet you can hire people to run it for you while you work full time. Find a student and watch over their first couple jobs and let them go out on their own after that. The work is easy enough that training is straightforward but the financial rewards can be significant.  Especially while working full time.
relationships,epznp8f,t3_bwn6fe,1559669193.0,"If you were afraid to tell him or feel like it was a waste of time the relationship is likely a waste of time. Your partner should be the first person you call. He should be someone that literally picks you up when you fall down. What if you were actually injured during the accident? Would you want him by your side? Would that comfort you? The answer to that question should tell you everything you need to know. If you do want him in your life maybe you should fix the communication issue before it turns into a large problem. Often men don't even know there's an issue (or pretend not to know) until it is brought up. Men are selfish creatures lol. If you have given him freedom and complacency maybe he DOES care about you but is taking advantage of the long leash of freedom you have allowed him. If he is not willing to meet you half way (compromise) with making a stronger effort to communicate than that answers your question again! 

Just my 2 cents..."
