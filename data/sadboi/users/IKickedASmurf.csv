NRelationships,fpvhsyt,t1_fpvgjeu,1588945066.0,"I completely understand this train of thought, the majority of us here do. I can promise you that if you get out it gets easier to live with and then one day you sit there and think to yourself ""wow, I can't believe I ever even felt that way in the first place.""

If you aren't at a point yet where you can leave, I understand that too. We all have a breaking point, if you haven't reached yours, you will. Just make sure you are taking care of yourself. Set some boundaries. Take care of your mental health. Don't always put him first. Do not ever risk your well being for the sake of someone who is tearing you down okay?

You can take baby steps in this! Realizing you these things in the first place is a great step! Now just try and keep going!"
NRelationships,fptfok9,t3_gfd973,1588890398.0,"When I was with my narc I lied to him about a lot of things. Things that I would never lie to other people about because there is no need to actually lie about them. But I was so terrified of him that I felt I HAD to lie to avoid his anger. And these were over stupid, small things. Like what friend did I talk to that day? What grocery store did I go to? Did someone talk to me about him?

The thing is, we shouldn't have to lie to anyone. You are in survival mode right now. It's causing you to panic. This is not healthy for you, your emotions, your mind, your body, it's not a sustainable way to live.

You are NOT a bad person for lying if you are afraid of his reaction. He is in the wrong for putting you in a position to be that scared. You need to really think about this long term, how long can you live this way? How long can you carry around this undeserved guilt?

You say that he has lied to you. Why are you holding yourself to a higher standard? Why do you owe him more of yourself than he owes you? What makes you feel you deserve this kind of treatment?

These are hard questions but they are ones you need to ask yourself, because at the end of all of this, which is really worse: him finding out you lied (because you are afraid) and leaving you, or continuing to live this way?

To me, I think it's scarier to keep living in constant distress and panic. It sounds like you deserve a much better life, much more support, and much more genuine love than what you are getting."
migraine,fpkzxms,t3_ge0buc,1588703941.0,I feel this hard. My insurance said I had to try seven different medications they approved before I could try the one my neurologist wanted me on.

But I was required to try them before I could get what my doctor actually recommended.

NarcissisticAbuse,fp2pd6o,t3_gawbin,1588265651.0,"First you need to heal. Wait long enough to date until you are 100% okay on your own, and know that you can handle the ups and downs of a stable and HEALTHY relationship, because even GOOD relationships have bad moments.

When you do find yourself dating and meeting someone, the first thing to do is set boundaries. Boundaries that you are confident and comfortable with. If that person does not respect your boundaries, they are not the person for you and you will know that you need to immediately end the relationship.

If the person respects your boundaries, has open and comfortable communication, and shares your values, then you will know when you are ready to tell them about your past abuse. Trust me when I say that the right person will understand. They will be kind and gentle, they will listen, they will work WITH you.

The biggest thing is to remember to end any and all toxic relationships as soon as they present themselves. Do not question yourself on this. If your boundaries are not respected then you are not respected.

There are good, amazing, kind people out there."

migraine,fot4mef,t1_fot1sdc,1588044537.0,"I think a lot of it is the lighting, I have always worked in offices with flourescent lights aside from a law office (in which my migraines were much lower). I wear sunglasses at work a lot which helps a little bit. I also work with A LOT of people so there is always background noise, I have a 40 minute commute both ways as well. And to be honest I don't like my office, it's very stressful and my migraines are brought on by a lot of stress and anxiety. So I think it's a big mixture of a lot of small things.

I just never realized that work affected my migraines so drastically before because I have never been out of the office for an extended period of time."

In my monthly meeting for April my manager saw that my productivity has gone up and my numbers have increased. He knows about my migraines and is really understanding, but because it's a fairly large company it would be difficult for them to make an exception for me to work at home.

I think my next step is to talk to my neurologist once things open back up and let them know about the improvement. I'm hoping with their support maybe the company will at least let me split some time between home and the office!"

I don't want Quarantine to keep going, I don't want people to keep getting sick, but I do wish that I could keep working from home and stay in my little bubble.

After the breakup I really felt like, good lord how can anyone EVER live up to or surpass that? But after a lot of time and a lot of healing I have realized that man is just ugly on the inside. He is dark and cruel, and it's made his outsides ugly too. It didn't come all at once but in small pieces.

Something really helpful for me was to remember all the bad things, the awful things, the unattractive things. Slowly I saw a snake when I thought of him, instead of a beautiful man.

It's hard but sometimes we have to train ourselves to see the ugly parts they hide."

I just kept reminding myself that it wasn't real. It wasn't the real him, the relationship wasn't real, it was never going to be what I wanted it to be, I wasn't even the real me anymore. Any time I felt like I missed him I made a list in my head of all the awful things he did to me and said to myself ""this is not normal"".

They train us to feel guilty but the truth is we have nothing to feel guilty about. We do not owe them or ANYONE ourselves or our heart. I would not expect someone to stay with me if they were unhappy, would you?

Once you are you for a bit you see with clear eyes, but you have to be out long enough. I do suggest blocking and ignoring all attempts at contact to make it happen.

There's nothing wrong with being afraid of being alone, but be honest with yourself, is being emotionally and mentally abused better than being by yourself for now? At least you would treat yourself well. At least you would love yourself and allow yourself to be YOU.
Let go of that fear, it sounds like it's truly the only thing holding you back. You deserve so so much better. There are so many people who could love you if you left this man and healed and put yourself in a place for a healthy happy relationship.
Narcs want us to believe no one will ever love us but the truth is that they just need to put us down so we don't go find better.
You can do this. Just make sure you take care of YOU."

NRelationships,f9f5s0r,t1_f9f4ey6,1575260311.0,"As someone who has been there and spent years with that same dilemma. The best things I can say to you are the same hard things a friend said to me.

First, what makes you think you deserve to be treated this way? What makes you think you need to give someone so many chances to treat you in ways that hurt you? Would you allow anyone else in your life to treat you the way this guy has repeatedly treated you? 

And second... He has shown he won't change. So you are left with this choice. Either you can accept that he is who he is and you can change yourself constantly to accommodate his unpredictable and abusive and hurtful ways and slowly lose yourself in the process...or, you can leave and be 100% your true self again.

Relationships with a narc are never easy to leave because they tend to prey on people who are kind and empathetic and who have HOPE. But in this case your hope that he can change, despite his repeated showing that not only does he not want to but that he won't, is harming you. He can't change because narcs can't realize there is anything wrong with their actions or behavior. 

Do this for yourself. You don't owe him any more of yourself. But you do owe it to yourself to take care of yourself.

Don't spend years of your life allowing this guy to tear you down and destroy you. You deserve a happiness that he can not give you.

Take the hope you are putting into him and put it into yourself. Put it into everything you want to be, everything you want to achieve, trust me there are so many beautiful things waiting for you that this guy can't give you, you just have to allow yourself to leave.

When I was with my narc, I felt deep down in my soul that something wasn't right. That there was no way it could last this way, that I couldn't spend my life with those ups and downs. Most people in narc relationships do feel that way. If you feel that, deep deep down, then maybe ask yourself if you are prolonging the inevitable by repeating this cycle? Ask yourself what is so terrifying about letting this person go? Ask yourself if the good times outweigh the bad, if the constant state of stress and unknown and feeling of not being good enough is really a way to live? If it's not, then remember that life doesn't have to be that way, you can leave and move past him and heal.

Sorry for the incredibly long reply, this internet stranger just wants to see you happy and thriving."

Block him on everything so you don't see what he's doing. Leave him behind for good. It hurts and it's hard to get over and at some points it feels impossible but you will come out the other side SO much happier. 

This cycle of toxicity and emotional abuse isn't good for you and it isn't sustainable. Don't let yourself keep becoming less of who you are for this guy!

Advice,f3ts7h1,t3_di6393,1571144744.0,"Experiences change us. You may not be the person you were before and that is okay. But you should accept that you aren't that person and that it's time to rebuild yourself as the new you! There is nothing wrong with who you are now!

Dating tends to suck no matter who you are. I know it sucked after my child's father and I split. It was one series of just ""eh"" situations after another, ghostings etc etc, until I really looked at myself and what I wanted, who I wanted to be, what I was ready for.

There's no time limit on when you should be ready, there's no definitive guidebook on how you should do this, there's just you and your own feelings. Get back to yourself and who you are now. My parents always told me ""be the person you want to be with"". I thought it was stupid for a long time but it's so true. Be happy with yourself! And THEN you will attract then kind of people you will be happy with as well. You are not destined to be alone. You have just changed, time for you to rebuild yourself man! It's gonna be awesome :)"
