AmItheAsshole,fd5n1cs,t3_ejmd22,1578179246.0,"UPDATE:  
I saw my sister today, and we talked about it. She doesn't want me to see her art, and I will thus respect her wishes.

She says she doesn't like the fact that people she knows IRL looks at her blog, so I asked why. Turns out that when she was studying at the comic school, one of her classmates made fun of her for making fanart of the same thing over and over again, as well as shared her Tumblr with a lot of people without my sister's permission. Yikes. What a crappy friend.  
Sis says she gets anxiety over this from time to time, this also explains why she absolutely HATES it when someone looks over her shoulder as she works.

Thank you, everyone, for your comments. <3"

AmItheAsshole,fcyx27h,t1_fcywhnh,1578088968.0,"None of the sort!

The most she does is some cute fluff, but it's nothing like that at all. Thinking about it, she has said that she feels insecure about it a lot. I am going to talk to her about it, but not pry. She's amazing and shouldn't be ashamed."
AmItheAsshole,fcywtey,t1_fcyw2uf,1578088811.0,"Oh, I should have elaborated, my bad - she's on a professional level, gets a lot of commissions and appears in a lot of fanzines and other prints with her works. Her art is her hobby, not her profession, but she's studied at a comic school and her major, like mine, was art.

&#x200B;

I will try and talk a little to her about it, not in a prying way, just as a curious and supportive sister. :) Thanks!"
