bipolar,fqzn1ux,t3_glsvvo,1589770832.0,"If there was one symptom that has had the most negative effect on my life, it is easily irritability. For me, the irritability is there regardless of my environmental circumstances, I'll just attach to something to blame, and obsess over it. The right meds should help. When I'm irritable I try my hardest to control my comfort by using noise cancelling headphones, wearing comfortable clothing and taking care of myself as best I can. I've recently started meditation and I think that's made the biggest impact on my irritability (if you would like some guidance getting started feel free to DM me). I also just started taking CBD oil (under guidance of my psychiatrist) for the last week which so far seems to be a great help!"

Someone shared this on this sub a few weeks ago, it's about as relatable as it gets to me and my disorder.
As far as I'm concerned, any substance abuse is a symptom of a higher disorder of some kind, don't be too hard on yourself for self medication with cannabis. You might find yourself not needing it if you manage to get hold of what's getting to you.
If you'd like to chat further, to try and gain some insight to your symptoms, feel free to hit me up privately. Sometimes it can help to use someone anonymously as an interactive journal!

Meditation,fp1d53z,t1_fp1adqz,1588231570.0,"I've received an overwhelming amount of fantastic responses from both the meditation sub and the bipolar sub. After reading some information that people have shared it seems that most negative consequences appear at the extreme side of practicing and my level (around 20 minutes, 3 times a day, a mix of unguided and guided) should be absolutely safe and provide great benefits. I've been going for about three weeks straight, and quite structured for the last 10 days and aside from being a little too far on the manic side for a few days, I feel amazing, better than ever. I also suffer from anxiety, and mild OCD however have had a huge subsidence of my symptoms, there is a few reasons for this. I do credit this video https://youtu.be/ukTaodQfYRQ which was shared to this sub by somebody a few months ago. It changed my thoughts on what meditation actually is as and I credit it for helping me manage my anxiety, OCD and irritability which ruled my life for a couple of decades.

At the end of the day, it seems I've just been feeling really good, and to be honest, it's been a while. It was a little confronting. But I'll take it! I'm going to keep going with my practice and ensure that I use moderation as I have a tendency to get very obsessed with whatever has my focus at the time.
