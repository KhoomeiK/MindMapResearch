stepparents,fqq9mmo,t1_fqowwbe,1589561746.0,Yes I actually mentioned to him last night about it. He says nothing and says he tries to do what’s “right” and if they want to suddenly sleep at their moms they should.
stepparents,fqq9ith,t1_fqosfti,1589561697.0,"Yes I understand all of that a thousand percent. But my schedule reference was more geared towards the whose house they are going to stay at every week. It’s all over the place. It’s way too much. I get they are more likely attached to their mom. But there just needs to be a schedule like the nights mom is working the next day you stay at daddy’s. Every other weekend you have the kids etc. And also, I’m out of a job right now... and she recommended I sign up for home services and help take care of her mother. I would get 1000 dollars and she gets 500 and I split the other half with her mother. I would make more on unemployment so I’m going to do that is that not normal these days to want to make more regardless if it’s unemployment or not?"

But I guess I want to know if maybe I need to just grow up. Maybe I need to get mature about things. Also. My dad slept on my floor in my Los Angeles apartment when he first left my mom (he told me he was here on vacation) but ended up leaving my mom. That was his plan. I walked in during my lunch breaks him having sex on my couch with a different woman a few times. I was so messed up from it although I was 27 at the time. Also, every time I try to see him nowadays he invites his girlfriend over and it bothers me I told him I want it to be him and I.. he doesn’t seem to respond to that. His brother committed suicide when he was 12 and he saw his brothers death. Sadly the aftermath. His life was never the same since. But still I try to see him in the light and with deep compassion but it’s costing me my own mental stability. I recently left that apartment to move in with a boyfriend. He was sleeping in my kitchen on a bed... he fell into a bunch of money from his  business and recently fixed up the entire apartment.. but claims his “gf “ helped him do that. I never had the money to fix up my own place.  Anyway, life is shitty sometimes."
