My questions are: 
 1.  was it hard or uncomfortable getting used to doing meet and greets at first? I remember I used to love meeting the princesses when I was little (still do) but I was always so shy that they had to do most of the talking, and I can imagine that‚Äôs a challenge to get used to doing at first. 
2. Do you often get teens/ adults come to see the princess that are genuinely playing along with the magic, or is it mostly little kids?

However, gun drills/lockdowns are fucking terrifying nowadays because we‚Äôve gotten bomb and gun threats to our schools before, and with all the shootings that happen in America, you worry that you‚Äôll actually have to use the things they teach you in those drills.

I had a best friend from 3rd grade up until sophomore year of high school, but she was also friends with my boyfriend at the time. When we broke up, it was really hard for me because it was seemingly out of nowhere and I really loved him, we were together for a year and a half. However, this girl turned on me and said a lot of horrible things to me and even encouraged me to self harm ‚Äúsince I was so depressed anyway‚Äù. She had always had problems filtering herself and saying things she shouldn‚Äôt, which for the record I talked to her about a million times because she‚Äôd often hurt my feelings and I got sick of it, but this just crossed the line. After that, I dropped her and a lot of my friends who behaved similarly due to the break up (which for the record, was not because anyone did anything and wasn‚Äôt even really a sides situation). I sat alone at lunch for months everyday and spent most of my time crying and doing things to distract myself from reality because the truth of losing everyone important to me was just too hard to handle. It took a little while, but by the end of that school year I did make some new and better friends and got a fresh start. However, they all had their best friend already when I got close with them. I do everything I can to be there for them when they need it, to make them smile and listen to them when they need someone to listen, and just go out of my way to be a good friend because that‚Äôs what I wish someone did for me when I was hurting so much. I feel like I definitely deserve to be at least one person‚Äôs best friend, but in my heart I just know that I‚Äôm not and it sounds silly but it really sucks to think about. Just writing this almost brings tears to my eyes. Especially because ever since my break up I‚Äôve had this worry that I‚Äôm never good enough for the people I love and that all my friends are gonna leave me one day and I‚Äôll be back where I started and it doesn‚Äôt help to know I‚Äôm not anyone‚Äôs first pick of a friend for anything."
