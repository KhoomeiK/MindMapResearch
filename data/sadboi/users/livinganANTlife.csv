povertyfinance,fjh38s3,t1_fjgpwf6,1583340378.0,"I really appreciate your well thought out reply. $50k a year is before taxes, so collectively around $45.5k after. 

I do think we are committed to making financial decisions together. We have lived together for almost two years now, however, he is very inexperienced when it comes to his finances. He has never taken out a loan or had a credit card. His credit score was bad when we first met, but we opened up a joint account with CareCredit so he could get some dental work done, and we have been making regular payments on that, which has helped his credit score quite a bit.

He also has dental insurance and is contributing to a 401k through his employer per my advice. 

He can be a little irresponsible about money sometimes, but there hasn't been a time where he wasn't able to pay his portion of the bills.

I bank through PNC, and they have their ""Virtual Wallet"" program which allows you to categorize spending, so that is usually what I do, but I do not have an itemized budget perse. I am not really sure how to create one, especially when I have expenses that vary from month to month.

I do keep track of the interested rates and things like that. Several cards have promo APR's for some of the balance either, 0% or a percentage that is lower than their standard APR.

I do know that I am going to have to work at least part time while I go to school. I already work in a pediatrics office for a large healthcare system, and I don't think it would be beneficial to leave when I am already in a position that is so hard to come by. It is pretty hard to get into peds. I also don't think I could be making more anywhere else. It may be an option to go part time, but I will not know until then. If I can't go part time in my particular office, I have the opportunity to transfer within the company I work for. They also provide $3000 a year for education expenses, which will also help.

I know that we sometimes spend on things we shouldn't. We throw away money buying lotto scratch off tickets and playing slot machines occasionally for entertainment. We don't eat out a whole lot, but have probably gone out several times in the past month for different occasions. I recently spent money on a going away gift for a very special doctor that works in my practice. My boyfriend does smoke weed (legal where we live), so that is a habit that he has to keep up with. So there are definitely areas where we can do better, and I realize that.

It is overwhelming to extent, but I feel like it is a necessary type of overwhelming, if I am ever going to get to a place in life where I feel financially secure."
povertyfinance,fjgvbfa,t1_fjgrut2,1583336228.0,"probably not, i have a hard enough time as it is managing my time. i have however lost a lot of weight recently, and i am trying to sell my clothes to make some extra money, so that helps, it's just not consistent."
povertyfinance,fjgv6x4,t1_fjgtn39,1583336154.0,"yes, rent and utilities are split equally. He also gives me gas money and money for groceries.

Other expenses include a monthly car payment (325.11), auto insurance (107), cell phone (94). Paying the minimum monthly payments on my credit cards mostly eats up the rest.

I did just pay off a loan that I took out to buy a new mattress that was 12 mos. 0% APR, so that frees up about 130 a month, and there are several cards I am near paying off (balanced around 100-200)"

here's my routine if you are interested!

AM: 

\- cleanse with warm water/wash cloth to exfoliate

\- while skin is still damp, hada labo premium lotion

\- benton snail bee high content essence mixed with 10 drops of Melano CC Vitamin C Serum

\- cerave eye repair cream, usually layer lancome visionnaire yeux advanced multi-correcting eye balm on top, because i have it and want to use it up

\- Tatcha The Water Cream

\- Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50+PA++++

PM:

\- remove makeup with clinique take the day off balm or garnier micellar water, depending on how lazy i am feeling or how much  makeup i have on

\- cleanse with la roche posay toleriane hydrating gently cleanser

\- apply hada labo premium lotion while skin is still damp

\- cosrx advanced snail 96 mucin power essence

\- clinique all about eyes eye cream

\- tatcha the dewy skin cream

i then go about my evening and about a half hour before bed i apply a pea sized amount of tret .025%

\- right before bed i apply cerave moisturizing lotion (in the tub)

\- apply LRP Cicaplast Baume B5 or Dr. Jart + Cicapair Tiger Grass Cream on the areas of my face that i know are especially flaky (around my nose, between my eyebrows, and near my eyes). 

&#x200B;

I just got the Cicapair cream from Marshalls over the weekend, so not sure if i love it yet or not, but i was almost out of my cicaplast baume. i have heard dr. jart changed the formula and everyone hates it, so i'm glad i got one at marshalls that is the old formula (metal tube) instead of the new formula."

I was fired and they told me that the reason was because I didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúthe wow factor‚Äù....whatever that means. My 15 year old‚Äôs self esteem took a serious hit after that.
HaircareScience,ff93rnp,t3_es7cvo,1579704134.0,I use the Kerastase purifying one to clarify about once a month and I love it. Smells amazing and gets my hair squeaky clean. My hair has so much volume after I use it. I usually follow with the Masque Hydra Apaisant Hair Mask. The two together work so well.

I recently subscribed to Scentbird with the hope of finding my signature scent....it used to be Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue but I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs a fit for me anymore. My first one from Scentbird is supposed to be You by Glossier and I‚Äôm super excited to try it out."

He said it tastes like crunchy oatmeal. Like unsweetened. Lol. I used to get a lot more from BzzAgent, but I think they are in the middle of merging with another company, so the website isn‚Äôt the same as it used to be when I logged in."

Makeup,fdhlsit,t3_elcoj8,1578425360.0,Does anyone have any recommendations on a good razor for dermaplaning? I got these Finishing Touch ones from Walmart and they suck!
Makeup101,fdgzs52,t1_fdf4e0a,1578412245.0,"I would recommend the E.L.F. Matte Putty Primer, which you could also just apply on your oily bits and use something else everywhere else."
Makeup101,fdepgr7,t1_fdep869,1578343886.0,Getting the minis is nice too because you can actually use it all before it dries up. I used to spend money on the full size and it would dry out before I could finish it!
Makeup101,fdeo20x,t1_fdej1nh,1578343067.0,"Okay, I have similar skin! So...you'll want to find a good primer first and foremost. The type of primer you pick really depends on what you want to accomplish. A good, affordable one is Nyx Angel Veil primer. 

When you pick a foundation, go with one based on where you will be wearing it, and what kind of coverage you like. I prefer something with a sheer to medium, natural finish for everyday. My favorite affordable choices are Wet 'n Wild PhotoFocus Liquid Foundation, L'oreal Infalliable Freshwear 24 hour Foundation, and Maybelline FitMe Matte and Poreless. You will want to purchase a sponge as well...RealTechniques makes a good one (the orange one). Finding your shade is going to be a little more difficult, because you usually can't try out drugstore products in store, so you want to go prepared. Find out which undertone you are and start from there. Look online to see what shades are available for your desired foundations.

You want your concealer to be about a shade lighter than your actual skin tone. Some good ones are Maybelline FitMe and the Colourpop concealer. 

Next find a good setting powder. Again, the Maybelline Fit Me Loose Finishing Powder works well. 

Next you'll want a blush so you don't look to ""flat"" or washed out. The color you get is going to entirely depend on your skin tone and what compliments it best. I have heard amazing things about the ELF Primer-Infused Blush and I personally have had a good experience with the Milani Baked Blushes.

Find a good eyebrow product, I personally use Anastasia but this is more expensive. I've heard good things about the Colourpop and Nyx Precision Brow Pencil. Set this with a clear eyebrow gel. You'll want to use light strokes for your brows. I recommend watching some tutorials on youtube.

There are several good options for an affordable mascara....Maybelline Lash Sensational, L'oreal Voluminois Carbon Black, and Essence Lash Princess Sculpted Volume. Pick one that meets your lash needs.

If you want to try a bronzer, I highly recommend the Physician's Formula Butter Bronzer. For a highlighter, the Essence Pure Nude Highlighter. 

You'll also probably want to get a basic brush set...Morphe or Real Techniques, and research what each brush is used for.

A good setting spray to make everything last...I'm not really sure a good affordable brand, Urban Decay All-Nighter is my holy grail.

If you want to get into eye shadow, I recommend getting a small palette with a mix of matte neutrals and shimmers to create a natural look. I'd check out the Ulta website and see what you like. I always try to read the reviews, because eye shadow palettes can be really hit or miss. Applying eyeshadow will take some time to get down. The main thing to know is that you want a matte brown/taupe in your crease and you want to blend, blend, blend, so there are no harsh lines. You can do matte or shimmer on your lids, depending on the look you want to go for.
