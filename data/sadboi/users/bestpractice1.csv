For this country to move forward progressively on a safe and secure footing rental laws need a comprehensive overhaul in light of modern conditions of life.  

And not just rental laws but City, regional and town planning including the rolling back of regulation to 1980s levels, you know like the traffic was there for a while.. 

I'd make cows protected, they contribute hard work and milk and over twenty years lifespan can help remediate all sorts of land to high levels of agricultural health. This proposal isn't so far out, many people protect the lifespans of cats and dogs who help so much in coping with life. Protecting happy cows is more country-based.
