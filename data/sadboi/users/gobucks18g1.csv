I know its hard as shit to think about right now, but trust your body and let it happen. Let your breathing go. It will work on its own I promise.

Since you have already been so helpful, I thought I would lay out for you bases I have already covered and to see your thoughts if I am missing something. I have already checked:
-CBC w/diff several times    
-CMP several times    
-Testosterone (which was low-ish and am being treated for. Could be a factor but I have no idea how. I am fairly well versed in it and it is well managed)    
-T3, t4, TSH    
-Iron and related tests    
-Ferritin (which was low but doctors wont listen, saying that you cant be anemic just by having low ferritin, which seems to be incorrect. It is basically my other strong lead along with UARS. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5986027/)    
-VItamin D    
 -Epstein Barr (only high IGG which seems to indicate only a past infection)    
-ANA    
-Sed rate    
-Lyme disease (tested 3 times)    
-Rheumatoid factor    
-CRP    
-CCP    
-Lipids    
-Cortisol    
-B12    
-Lead    
-Sleep apnea (home test)    
-Just had allergy testing that showed I am fairly allergic to a few things, a few types of trees and grass    

Current symptoms:
-Excessive daytime sleepiness
-inability to focus
-general weakness
-nostrils feel swollen
-sinus pain, pain behind eyes
-headaches

I will say too that I am currently seeing an ENT and have a sinus CT wednesday. He has me scheduled with a pulmonologist, Dr. David A. Kristo in August. But thats quite some time do feel awful during the day. He seems to have done research on Silent Upper Airways Resistance Syndrome (SUARS) which seems the same as UARS?

The ENT says my nasal passageways are tiny and turbinates are swollen. He made no comment about my jaw or teeth. I know for a fact that I do have an overbite and a recessed lower jaw. My teeth are also somewhat narrowing because I admittedly did not keep up with my retainer after braces. 

I found a Resmed Aircurve 10 VAuto on craigslist a ways away but it seems fairly cheap. I might PM it to you to make sure it is the correct one. 

What are your thoughts on getting this machine before getting a sleep test considering all my eliminated theories? I honestly dont have a problem spending $500 for even temporary relief. It is starting to get that bad and impacting my life. 

I would love help finding a dentist in the area who is familiar with this stuff. At minimum I will go just to see what they think. I live in the Pittsburgh Area.

Thank you so much again for all this help. It means the world to me that you took the time to outline all of this for me."
