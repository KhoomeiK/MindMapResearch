I offered to get my niece a tablet when she was 2 or 3 and her parents said no. I never understood it because she watched TV all the time. In a way I think it can help limit screen time because you can physically take it away, set parental controls, and control the content on it. It also helps teach responsibility to treat things with respect and you have to learn to charge it and take care of it.

Even if you use it once a week for 15 minutes as a reward for good behavior, your daughter would turn out fine. It might be nice to have for a road trip or unexpected doctor visit with a long wait."

A lot of times they get a surplus of inventory and you can find deals. For example, I bought a big pack of Kleenex brand pocket tissue. They've had Snyder's brand pretzels in the large bags. Sometimes they have Betty crocker or cake boss brand kitchen items. Some of the toys are pretty good, like they have the kids at work stacking blocks or outdoor balls/bubbles.

It seems the process was pretty through in applying, requesting personal information and submitting a picture of your family holding your username and such.

I saw another request to ban people next year who break rules. Although I'm hoping to not have to return as a requester next year, I'll be the first to admit I broke a rule accidentally that I didn't know was not allowed of deleting my request post. I screenshot the comments so I could make sure to come back and thank my Santa's but I didn't want someone to purchase any more for my family since the kids had received a few gifts each and someone was good enough to purchase items for me and my boyfriend as well (he's my baby daddy x2, weddings are just expensive 😂). Shortly after I got a message from a mod asking why I did and I apologized and explained why I did and still feel badly about it.

I've also been really bad at thanking my Santa's. I did once the gifts arrived and posted one picture but both of my kids have been sick, the baby more severe, so I've been slacking on my growing to-do list. I also am not sure how to upload pictures or use imgur.

My son has a speech delay and if my mom hadn't said anything to me, I wouldn't have known anything was ""wrong"". We had him evaluated just before he turned 3 through the local school district and he's received speech therapy ever since (he's five now).

You don't notice things as much within your own kids, especially when you don't have as much experience to compare them to other children. They may be blowing it off as in all kids are different or have their own strengths or weaknesses, not necessarily as this is something he could receive services to help him be successful.

I think early intervention is key. It helped us a lot and I'm thankful my mom pushed me to have him evaluated. It was hard and I was in denial that anything was ""wrong"" with my kid, but it has helped him."
