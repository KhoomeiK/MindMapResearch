relationship_advice,ex62h3t,t3_crg5dy,1566037568.0, Yeah all he wants is some sex few times of doing that he’ll get bored then move on to the next woman you don’t want that you actually have respect for yourself and want something that isn’t just gonna last a couple of weeks I suggest you just say that to him and see his reaction if it was me personally tho I wouldn’t trust him but that don’t mean you can stop being friends you just need to tell him you’re looking for something more something that is going I last but you don’t see that happening with him so the only thing. You can be is friends if he keeps asking for booty pics and being weird like that tho I’d just block completely hope this helped :)
relationship_advice,ew7umwq,t3_cmwm2o,1565197506.0,"Thanks for all the comments but I was just being an idiot really I know me and my girlfriend have something special and it’s hard to find these days she’s my first ever girlfriend I was a virgin till I met her and in a bad place before we met too I was fat as hell weighing 20 stone then lost 6 stone down to 14 stone now I probably met her at about 15 stone but she’s really helped me through a lot my social anxiety, depression, my brother got stabbed a couple years ago he didn’t die messed up our whole family a bit tho then his ex girlfriend accused him of rape and put us in more shit but she’s just been there with me through all of it and I get a lot of thoughts on my head probably because of anxiety and I smoke weed but sometimes I think stupidly but yeah sorry for the massive life story maybe you wanna hear it maybe you don’t oh well feels good putting it out there I’m not bored of her I was just tired and I smoked weed that day so I was on a bit of a comedown as well I realise I really need to stop weed tho it’s hard but yeah I recently started a new job as well and things are just looking up for me lol this isn’t even about relationships now is it oh well fuck it but yeah I think my girlfriend will be in my life till the day I die we’ve helped each other in a lot of ways and I couldn’t be happier if you did read this then thank you for taking an interest I wish you the best and if you’re in a mess feel free to drop me a text I can be good at talking to people relieve your stress I hope the person beside you will leave you with no regrets :)"

relationships,evr037i,t1_evqxufz,1564699742.0,Yeah she probably is the one on the side but it’s hard to hear I don’t think there’s a way through it 🤷‍♂️ There’s liking attention but it sounds like he’s gone a bit too far with the attention I guess there’s a possibility he hasn’t cheated but I think it might just be a matter of time because if he’s really about you then he will only want your attention no one else’s I been with my girl about 6 months now and I would never ever do anything like this to her especially because her ex did the same sort of thing to her as what you’re going through. He was gas lighting her manipulating her and talking to girls behind her back and cheating on her but yeah anyway the signs of your relationship do not look good do you see yourself with this person in say 10 years time?  Could you put up with him meeting all these new girls from Instagram every so often? What do you think you should do?
relationships,evqw8no,t3_ckrpsl,1564698232.0,"It’s probably no what you want to hear but leave that fucker right now. 😂 sexual comments on his insta and they know eachother in real life and text constantly I think you’re just his thing on the side don’t give in to his manipulation he’s cheating on you I think you already know that. If someone is in love with you they don’t have time for anyone else they’re all about you, think would you do this to him? No because you love him do you really think the feeling is mutual? good luck."
RoastMe,evqtonf,t3_cklutl,1564697224.0,Your hair screams out emo and your moustache looks like you cut off your dads pubes and stuck them on your face and look at your fingers they look as floppy as your dick. 😂🥶
mentalhealth,etlyg1w,t3_cc5hp6,1562948105.0,Yeah that’s weird maybe she got some problems going on in her own life or something you done or said triggered her still no excuse for telling a patient to go through with killing them self 😂 I would definitely report that. If you were being serious about killing yourself tho please don’t that’s weak removing the problem by removing yourself we are strong if we continue with our life to try and solve the problem. Problems never last forever.
mentalhealth,etlj0y8,t3_cc5hp6,1562937778.0,What did you do for her to say this?
mentalhealth,et7voaj,t3_caclje,1562539397.0,Sounds like you don’t like the choices you make maybe you should consider eating healthier and doing exercise and having a set time you wake up to I think you know what you need to do but you’ll only stay the same if you don’t just go ahead and do it. Hope this helped
socialanxiety,esoguw3,t1_esjrerv,1562167308.0,I don’t think so
socialanxiety,esitmil,t3_c7uyh6,1562019982.0,What are you experiencing? Awkward social interactions?
problems,es9wwg8,t3_c3qlpp,1561746369.0, No problem tbh I think you just have some asshole neighbour that’s just being nasty for the sake of it if the council aren’t doing anything about it then just call the police that’s your only last option I think
relationships,es37opc,t3_c5nsol,1561555840.0,That’s the thing with a block you will never really know 🤷‍♂️ I think these other Redditors are right though it sounds like he did still have feelings for you and I think he has for a long time but now you shut him out he’s realised there is no chance so thought he would just cut you off completely and focus on his actual wife and kids
relationships,es36syw,t3_c5k2t1,1561555152.0,Reaching out to an old friend that’s famous is a complete Nono lol if you haven’t spoke to this person in a long time then if you reach out to them all they’re going to think is you just want their fame and money to benefit yourself even if that’s not your intentions for some reason your boyfriend doesn’t realise that and you’ve got to make him realise somehow. This isn’t something that should end a relationship but it does sound like you have different minds I think you realise and understand things better than he does and I think you understand what you need to do no one can really tell you what to do they can only help you but you do need to make him start realising other people’s feelings. What do you think of him when he’s not trying to get you to reach out to this famous person? Is he nice? Does he treat you right? Are you both in love?
problems,es1tbyz,t3_c3qlpp,1561505235.0,"Well you’re hitting his fence lol that can be annoying to people as that sound can be loud it’s probably especially annoying if he is old as well although that doesn’t give him the right to be swearing and shouting abuse at you especially in front of a 5 year old. 

I suggest maybe getting a softer or lighter ball to play with so when it does hit the fence it doesn’t make a huge bang if that doesn’t work tho and it’s still noisy then you’ll probably have to put the goal the other side of your garden away from the fence if that makes it worse to play tho then your only option is to just go out to the park and play. 

I guess you could try going to the council again tho maybe you didn’t give them enough detail tell them that he shouts abuse at you and that you have a a brother that is 5 years old that he shouts and swears in front of yeah it’s annoying that you’re probably bashing his fence with the ball but he could discuss it with you calmer rather than shouting. Hope this helped :)"

amiugly,eqvx3kq,t3_bysjre,1560350685.0,Lol appearance does matter really that’s the harsh truth but just coz you’re ugly you shouldn’t avoid people you just need to tell your brain to not care what others think and if you’re wanting a girlfriend you need to find someone that’s going to appreciate you for who you are and the only way you’ll find that is by socialising I used to be so fat I weighed 20 stone it made me like you wanting to avoid all social interactions just because I thought people would make fun of me until I just started not giving a fuck and decided I wanted change now I weigh 14 stone got a sharp jawline and just look back on myself thinking why was I like that mentally I mean because we get no where if we think everyone is judging us because rally they’re probably not and if they are then fuck them lol just be yourself hope this helped
GiftedConversation,eqnndwt,t3_bkxkui,1560177959.0,"We make our own world everything living on earth is just another living thing with its own world inside of our own worlds helping to make our worlds better and I’m sure beyond earth there are other living things with different worlds if that makes sense basically what I’m saying is we just gotta do what we need to do to survive there’s no point thinking it’s just emptiness because it’s not lol there is stuff everywhere people everywhere, animals, bugs all living and all doing what they can to survive in our world to me it’s all about survival to experience better things in your world but if you think like that then your world will get destroyed."
MYLIFE,eqnegb2,t3_befgqs,1560175039.0,That does sound like a crazy journey it’s just stupid though how you can let yourself become like that over a girl I understand you loved her and the pain you were feeling but if someone leaves you for failing then that isn’t love in the first place someone who loves you will watch you fall and do what they can to get you back up you should have just said fuck you I don’t care what you think then you don’t like me if you can’t stand me failing. We all make bad decisions in life but we never make them bad decisions constantly there will always be that one good decision that leads us to a better life and it looks like you’re starting to make them good decisions more often you just have to keep trying. Some people don’t have families that can look out for them but it looks like you have a family that loves you and family will always be there for you just stick by them. Good luck.
