customhearthstone,fpqzj2m,t3_geu8sk,1588837159.0,"The perma attack seems too over powered, it’s basically giving you a free demon hunter hero power each turn. You also can’t have attack on your opponents turn so I’d change the wording. The outcast effect seems strange since you won’t have much attack even if you play this on turn 10 I wouldn’t say that effect is that powerful or necessary. As for the hero power it seems out of place. Demon hunter has quick tempo plays that don’t exactly fit what this hero power offers. Yes you could sometimes rarely get a good combo but when you look at what’s the best play in a turn the hero power doesn’t offer too much value and it seems out of place. The design could use some work and seems sloppy. It doesn’t tie in with WoW lore and I don’t think blizzard would print something like this. You could argue mecha jaraxxus isn’t in WoW but he is an actual limited time playable hero. It went along with the boomsday theme etc. I also don’t think a hero card is good for demon hunter. I think what blizzard was going for with demon hunter didn’t need a hero card. They might add one later, but the future is to tell. Another thing, demon hunter has taken over the meta since the new expansion and has ruled an insane amount of play. Blizzard is focused on balancing demon hunter so if you did get this card to work, demon hunter would not need a boost. Its a cool concept but I still think it needs some working on. Just my feedback hope it helped. Have a good one."

I put the RGB fans on the radiator along with the front metal panel but after trying several times I couldn’t get the thumb screws to line up vertically, the screws were higher than the holes. It was less than an inch probably a bit more than a centimeter away. I tried laying the case down, managing cables that could get in the way, and I even tried applying pressure. It does take a bit of force to push the fans in but I’m pretty sure once the screws line up it’ll be easier to get into place. Just wondering how you did it and if I’m doing anything wrong.

Just start with the small things, exercise daily and eat healthy. Mental health just like physical health is effected by your dieting and how active you are and tbh it makes most people feel better in general, I would set routines and try to push yourself day by day. Continue to be social, if you need help talk to people. Talking to people in general is good for you, loneliness has some of the greatest side effects. If you need mental help talk to a therapist and I recommend meditating. It’s not chanting in a dark room for 3 hours, just calm yourself and take deep breathes when your feeling overwhelmed. Nothing help me out of that dark place until I treated it like one of my any other health problems. I know it sounds cliche but keep a journal, if you want to record how your day went then go for it, but I used mine to keep a routine and make sure I did all the things I needed to do and not just lay in bed all day. Those are just some of the basic things that helped me, I hope I can help you too. If you do seriously need mental support talk to someone who is trained to properly help you. Take it slow and make sure your taking care of yourself before you stress about other things, if your in a tough spot in life your not going to function well in general. I don’t know a lot of specifics so I’m scratching the surface of a very complicated topic. I hope one day you can say that you feel better."

mentalillness,fo906q1,t3_g611yy,1587607594.0,"That's more sociopathic behavior (manipulating etc.), but a lot of teenagers (usually from ages 12-15) go through that phase if it is more serious for you, ask for help. It's most likely normal and if you don't grow out of it you should consult a therapist. If your intelligence is correct it could have effects on your behavior since you are more ""self-aware"". Make sure you have had an official IQ test before saying numbers that represent how smart you THINK you are. Intelligence may change with age and it is extremely unlikely you have an IQ above 145 (about 1% of the overall population). It is not that I don't believe you it's just it's a very unlikely chance and I don't want you to live a lie. If you are diagnosed with psychopathy or sociopathy know that people who have those diagnoses end up successful and I had a few friends with it. It mostly just means you don't feel empathy. I had a phase pretty exact to what you were describing, a lot of people called me sociopathic and I believed it for a long time, I soon realized most people go through it and it's a common thing. Killing bugs is normal, a lot of people do it to express anger. I had a friend in middle-highschool who would torture them. He's fine now and shows nearly no signs.

She couldn’t care less, she was a nobody before Carson, he helped in every way. He streamed with her nearly every day giving her hundreds of thousands of subscribers on twitch and YouTube. She literally used him, you can’t blame Carson he was going through a rough time when he first met her and her doing this bullshit made it worse. Not a lot of people heard but she signed a deal with tempo storm, which I wasn’t surprised by, she abused the fame Carson gave her and now is trying to “move on to someone bigger” (that being fitz) to probably drain everything from him as well. Of course she got caught so she’s fucked for now, probably ruined her whole career. To bad people actually trusted her, especially Carson. This was his first relationship and he was already batting depression. Bitch didn’t even help him, she just slept with one of his best friends FULLY KNOWING he was in a rough spot. Instead of helping him like a good friend or lover she ruined his relationship with her and fitz. Fitz had the balls to sleep with her thinking they wouldn’t get caught so figured he was already a horrible person. After that she makes a bullshit response and you know how that goes. She says she was going through a hard time (which is of course bullshit) and instead of working through it with Carson she turns to fitz (like every loyal person I’m a relationship. Look to the other man in your life and end up fucking him). She says she never “confirmed she was in a relationship” with Carson and even said she had a b o y f r i e n d before and Carson didn’t know about it, as I was saying before the cycle of cheating continues, she went on a dating show while she had a boyfriend. I’m pretty sure everyone knew they were in a relationship and she’s just making excuses.
