I get so worn down with my adrenaline spikes, racing heart, shaking, crying, nausea/overactive intestines, etc. Going through one of those periods now, and I feel like I've run a marathon each day."
Anxiety,fcrwvxo,t1_fcrvlcr,1577907731.0,"Hell yeah it is! Definitely sucks, but most things that are worth it are scary xD"
Anxiety,fcrv7u6,t3_eihiwy,1577907065.0,"That is awesome!!!! Congrats. I know how scary it can be to do things/think about things/confront things that can trigger you. Wonderfully inspiring to hear about successes, especially when there are so many of us (myself included) going through rough patches."
PanicAttack,fcrutty,t3_eihvdr,1577906910.0,"I get very similar symptoms when my panic/anxiety is bad. I have a racing heart, feel buzzy in my own body, find it hard to eat, and feel like everything runs through my body too fast. That paired with the lack of wanting to eat can make me lose weight that I can't really afford to lose. I get the shakes too, but I've been able to calm those down after some practice over the years. They still come if my panic is really bad though.

The worst part for me is how I can go from not having panic attacks or symptoms for up to over a year and then as soon as I have one I have a period where I feel like every little thing can set me off. That increased sensitivity takes me time to get over, which frustrates me. 

I also find distractions for my mind are good, just like u/GreetingsMyBeings mentioned. I will leave the TV on, browse the internet (often at the same time), etc. Honestly after I had my first panic attack I was able to quiet my mind using that approach most often. Have TV on in the background and also focus on something with my computer to ""fully occupy"" my brain. Then I would lots of times sleep with the TV on, so I had something for my mind to focus on if I snapped awake randomly in the middle of the night. It kept my mind from racing immediately upon waking. I also used some Xanax during that time and a few times thereafter. I am going through a bad period right now (due to my own stupidity), and I've taken Xanax twice. I like to avoid getting dependent on that though. CBD oil has been a wonderful supplement for me in the last year without the side effects of the anti-anxiolytic prescription drugs. Although those are a godsend sometimes and nothing to be ashamed about.

Can't say my answers are the best, but it's what helps me!! I will say those coping mechanisms above are paired with therapy and daily anti-depressants. Those are my go-to panic things though. I deal with depression and milder anxiety all the time, which is what the other meds are for. 

Just know you are not alone! We can all get through this. Hope you are doing better today."
