Of course, back then you also had to buy a ticket rather than, you know, simply exist.  And if you went a bit *further* back, you *didn't* want to win the lottery, especially if you were a man aged eighteen to twenty-five, because your prize was an all-expenses-paid trip to scenic Vietnam.

As far as I know, there's no war in Vietnam anymore, and even if there was they wouldn't be sending babies and the elderly there - but I still suspect this lottery is more like the latter than the former.

My parents thought they were safe.  Like many couples, they'd hitched because of their matching birthdays - if they had to Go, they'd Go together - and theirs happened to be February 29.  The luckiest birthday of all, because it only could be picked in leap years.  But it *was* picked.  It was picked the year I turned fifteen, and because that was now legally the age of adulthood, I had nowhere to turn.  No foster care.  Just a crappy barista job and a smelly, scratchy cot in a cramped flophouse that runs me just over a hundred grand a week.

They always host the lottery on Halloween.  I don't know why.  Probably to increase the scare factor, which is kind of ironic since people's tolerance for risk-taking has actually *increased* since they implemented it - if there's an unmitigable 1-in-365 chance you're going to die (or whatever) each year no matter what your age, what's the big deal, right?  But they host it on Halloween, and they always do it promptly at nine o'clock, so although my shift technically ended at eight, I've stayed to watch.

""That's you, buddy,"" my co-worker Josh says, giving me a playful punch in the shoulder.  ""Be sad to see you Go.""

Caretakers ensure that the young, the infirm, or those otherwise unable to Go on their own do Go, and ""caretakers"" of another type - emotionless military drones, either of the human or robotic variety - ensure that those of age who are *unwilling* to Go are made to anyway, and while wearing a shaven head and a stupid pink jumpsuit to boot.  I'm pretty sure those Go somewhere different and probably in a far more painful manner.

Am I surprised to find out it's a football stadium?  Not really.  There are a lot of us.  We're given tickets after all.  Mine has me in section 6, row 4, seat 10 - an aisle seat, I notice with some amusement.  In case I have to go to the bathroom.

The guards don't say anything, don't explain anything, don't do anything except usher everyone to their seats, by force if necessary.  Once we're all seated, a marching band comes out onto the field and plays the national anthem - as though a football game is *actually* about to start.  I can't help but laugh at the incongruity.

Anxiety,fpy88lp,t1_fpy5ew5,1588998195.0,"The United States has 5-1/2 times as many people as Italy and 7 times as many people as Spain.  

Which means that right now we have the equivalent of 240k Italy-cases (a bit more than Italy's actual), and about 14k Italy-deaths (less than half Italy's actual).  Or, alternatively, we have the equivalent of 188k Spain-cases (about 2/3 of Spain's actual) and only about 3,700 Spain-deaths (one-seventh Spain's actual).

While it does seem like cases aren't dropping, we've massively increased testing in recent weeks and even still cases are flattening out.  The 7-day moving average of new cases/day peaked on April 9.  The 7-day moving average of deaths peaked on April 20.  We just had the fewest number of Friday deaths since April 3.

We're more spread out, with a big population, so the country isn't just one big outbreak zone.  It's several smaller outbreaks, each of which follows their own peak-curve."

I had my first in-person meal at a restaurant last night and the experience was... surprisingly normal.  Granted, I **normally** go to restaurants at off-peak hours, especially when dining alone, but yeah.

The major difference was that the waitress who served me (it was self-seating) asked how many there would ultimately be in my party, to which I simply responded ""just me.""  But to be fair, that question is ALREADY common in restaurants."
Anxiety,fpvvm0r,t1_fpvunuj,1588952635.0,"Exactly.

Anxiety,fpsvjui,t1_fpskwb7,1588880342.0,"For what it's worth, I have been upvoting theae when I see them.  Not because I necessarily agree with them, but because they are still legitimate concerns.  Some areas really *might* be opening too soon, and especially if you're high-risk, your ""too soon"" is going to be later than a low-risk individual's. Whereas if your livelihood depends on tourism/travel/venues/something else ""non-essential,"" there never was a ""too soon""; for you it's always been ""not soon enough.""

The problem, as usual, is that the Internet in general and Reddit in specific produce echo chambers and polarized viewpoints by their very nature.  The only way to really avoid this would be to remove karma, remove blacklisting/blocking of users, and possibly even restrict reporting of posts for moderation.  Force, in other words, even the most reprehensible posts to remain.

Once that happens, even tentatively expressed moderate views like ""We can't stay locked down forever"" and ""We might be opening up too soon"" become equated with the extreme versions ""Reopen everything right now!"" and ""Wuhan-style lockdown until vaccine!""

This pandemic is a no-win scenario, something we as a society hate dealing with.  Option A: Do nothing, keep everything open, and many die and others probably stay-at-home anyway even if not compelled, and everyone is scared and demanding action.  Option B: Shut everything down, and you cripple industries, demonize normal human activity, and you *still* have plenty of people dying, but now everyone else is scared and miserable.  And that's it.  Partial shutdowns and phased reopenings are simply combinations of A here, B there.  There is no Option C that lets everybody win.

And I haven't even *started* talking about a polemical partisan media that either doesn't understand statistics or is deliberately misusing it for clicks and views...
