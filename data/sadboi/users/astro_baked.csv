AskReddit,f32n8et,t3_dff81o,1570618915.0,"One time at a Plant/Garden center. There was a girl who wore big baggy cordaroys, had shaggy hair. She came in almost every day of the week. As she walked through our annuals and perennials, she'd clip off pieces to propagate plants of her own. [She's going to grow them herself without paying the $12.99 or etc] Smart girl I'd say. So after about 2-3 months of this - I thought to myself, that is quite enough. An entire house full of growing plants? A yard full? When does it stop? One day I had to bring an end to it. I walked right up as quickly as I could, pointed my finger at her and said 'HEY! YOU HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH FREE PLANTS, YOU JUST STARTED WORKING HERE"". The face looking back at me is mine, in the mirror, laughing maniacally knowing damn well I'm going to continue until I have an endless sea of Pothos and Succulents. 

I tried.

depression,evh68qj,t3_cjy2xu,1564521452.0,"SSRI's might not metabolize correctly for you. Ask your doctor/psych to take the GenoMind genetics test. It tells you all about your genes and what medicines will and will not work for you. It's a great tool to get right down to the issues. To try and correct them from a biological perspective. Not just relaying of feelings. 

But to answer your question, Seroquel has helped me tremendously. Only issue I have is that I don't have an opportune time to take it, as it makes me very tired very quickly. It's a light mood stabilizer used to target symptoms of bipolar, depression and schizophrenia. I'm in the midst of being diagnosed with bipolar. We're still working out the kinks which has me at a bit of a low right now. 

Anywho, ask your Doctor about the GenoMind Genetics Testing. See if your insurance covers it. I can't tell you how much this tool has helped my care-team. 

It's SO important to understand your personal pharmacokinetics. to be able to get down right to the source and start figuring out what's going on in your brain and how your doctor's can fix it. I can't tell you how much it put things into perspective. I give many thanks to the people over at GenoMind.

I cannot tell you how AWFUL this looked. Instantly I had tears running down my face. I really had thought that I had become desensitized to what I could have possibly seen all my years in a nursing home. Boy was I wrong. 
This woman's entire backside/lower back/thighs looked entirely like raw hamburger meat. Thick buldg-y, raw, infected and weeping. 
I did everything I could to make sure she was comfortable.

One day she for some reason left, what was basically a whole cigarette, in the ashtray, burning. She was in the shower when I stumbled upon it. So...you guess it. I gave it a big whopping go.
I could remember the fire of a thousand burning suns erupting in my esophagus. Choking on this smoke, I panicked and thought to myself, I'm going to die. (Mind you I'm roughly 7/8 yrs old) I contemplated knocking on the bathroom door and asking for help but, knew if the smoke didn't kill me, she sure would. 
Long story short I ended up making my way upstairs, to die in peace. 
I lived to tell the tale. I now smoke Newports and have been since I was 14. To this day you cant get me to take a drag of a regular cigarette, I would probably go into some sort of 'nam flashback. And to answer your question, I don't really go without them. If I do, I'm fucking irritated and that's for sure. It's the only thing I can think about if I don't have any, like a lizard brain. But, I unfortunately LOVE cigarettes and that's just me.

Until yesterday and today I was irritated, forgetting things, getting irritated more because I was forgetting things. And then I completely lost myself to the point where I almost walked out of my job because I couldn't get myself out of the headspace. Doctor said to me that there's a point in the ups where things get scrambled at the peak, mania makes it quicker for you to get irritated, lose track of time, blank out, and just purely mess up whatever you were doing. Seemingly out of nowhere. Then after it happens you feel like garbage, because your brain was already in the mix of the scramble to ""get down from the peak"". Then it just transfers into your down.

You bring your own clothes food, etc and clean up after yourself. The people who work there will all have been in some sort of crisis/trauma situation themselves and they're just there hanging out if you need to talk. There's also other people there just doing the same as you, trying to escape from the stressors without being hospitalized. You don't even have to talk to anyone if you don't want to. It's just a house, with places to read and sit, a backyard to lay in etc. There's one called The Rose House in upstate New York.
