If you are going to use an artwork as your own + especially make profit off of it you need to find out where the source is before you do anything! That's just stealing. Not every image online is up for grabs. And it's not just about giving credit. Not giving credit is one thing but you need the creator's permission to use it FIRST, then you give credits. If they say no fuck off you can't use it even if you credit them a million times."

What can go wrong when I feel SO GOOD and I can basically do anything? This time it‚Äôs different, this time it‚Äôs real.

AskReddit,eyn2be9,t3_cv7ina,1567228440.0,"I‚Äôm 21. Just moved to a new city this Feburary, first time in 10 years. I‚Äôm a first year in uni, studying music composition but it‚Äôs not going well. 

I have bipolar disorder, I‚Äôm trying to get ahold of it for most of the time, but I can‚Äôt all the time. It gets tiring after a while, especially because it can‚Äôt be completely cured. Also have anxiety, panic attacks... all that jazz.

I‚Äôm in the second semester of the year; did pretty okay in the first half of the first semester but depression hit, couldn‚Äôt get out of bed or eat or shower or show up to class, so I ended up getting all F. I got another chance because my doctor wrote me a note, but I gotta get really good-ish grades this semester in order for me to not get kicked out.

I used to work at McDonald‚Äôs for a while, but quit, because of... you know. Not being able to get out of bed.

Before this and after high school I was in a cycle of getting a couple job, then depression or mania would hit after a while, destroy my life and get fired/have to quit, then I‚Äôll go back on disability benefits until I can function enough to get a job. I‚Äôm trying to get stable but sometimes psychosis pops up and it‚Äôs always terrifying every time. I‚Äôll never get used to that.

In terms of relationships, my mum died when I was in high school, I don‚Äôt talk to my dad, no siblings, no girlfriend but not looking to date. I don‚Äôt want to be a burden.

I have 3 close friends, two living overseas. But we (at least I think) are very close, and I‚Äôm lucky to have friends like them.

I think I might be developing a benzo addiction. Blacked out three times this week, and was unconscious once.

I don‚Äôt really feel much. I don‚Äôt know how I think of my life. Sure, it can get better. And of course I‚Äôm not happy. I guess I would like it if I were happy. But I think I‚Äôll settle for taking naps and getting high.

I‚Äôm pretty sure no one would‚Äôve taken the time to read this long as comment, but if you did, thanks."

If you get 5 hours everyday for a couple weeks you might be manic but there should be other obvious signs than just sleep... but when I‚Äôm hypo/manic I either don‚Äôt sleep at all or sleep for 3 hours tops. I think depression makes people sleep more (at least for me) though you can get insomnia so if you have to be up at a certain time and you can‚Äôt fall asleep for hours you might only get 5 hours.

It felt like someone knocked me down in my head but in a good way. Unless its xr that small dose normally wears off in a couple hours. I never felt any rebound anxiety after benzos unless you‚Äôre talking about withdrawals which was a living nightmare. But one pill once? You‚Äôll be fine. Have a safe flight.
bipolar,eo9acjk,t1_eo8ez73,1558386370.0,"Oh yeah, I was never on ambien (my country doesn‚Äôt have that as far as I know) but the zopiclone withdrawal was a nightmare too, except I didn‚Äôt have a job or in school so I could just lie down all day and do nothing.

I was on it for about a year and I gained 12 kilos in the first 3 months. I gained a bit more over the past year (I‚Äôm scared to look at the scale so I don‚Äôt know the exact number) but I go to the gym everyday (when I‚Äôm not depressed) and walk a lot. But still couldn‚Äôt lose a single kilo. I used to be underweight for most of my life and now I‚Äôm overweight. (not entirely because or zyprexa, but also bc of depakote, etc but zyprexa was the worst) I got crazy appetite on it, when I started eating I could not stop until I throw up and would not be able to fall asleep because I‚Äôd be thinking of food and had to go make myself a midnight snack. I ate compulsively even when I was feeling nauseous or took meds that make food taste bad. That‚Äôs why I got off of it.

Also the general oversleeping and brain fog was terrible as well. The brain fog slightly lifted after a while but it was still there, and I was having trouble waking up after 10-12 hours of sleep so I had to go to bed right after I had dinner (which probably wasn‚Äôt good for my weight either). A couple days after getting off of it, I woke up without an alarm after 7 hours.

I was put on it after a manic episode, first it was good, killed the mania right away, but I personally found it kind of hard to function on zyprexa for long term."
