Cave full of goblins. The bad kind. Quest, find missing Town's people. Group rolls in and steam rolls a bugbear relaxing in a hot spring. Murders three goblins with no sweat broken. Slime gets the drop on us and destroyed. All the goblin fights are cake. 

Final room. Spider webs? We are totally expecting spiders. Nope. A giant Lurker. Barbarian Spartan kicks it down a hole.

Foolishly I tell the GM, that was boring. We want a challenge. So GM delivers. Two Lurkers right after the fight. 

Druid pet, slain. Champion shield destroyed. Out of healing spells. Battle rages. Barbarian does all the damage and Champion soaks it up like a good tank. Barbarian spends hero points for rerolls. Amazing hits. Send the Lurkers back down the pit from whence they came. One hell of a battle.

The day the leader (I was Co-leader) deleted the sixth person for being a month AFK... I had four gifts to give now. Not five. I quit and searched for a new guild. My theory was so clear to me as soon as I looked for a guild. I wanted a guild that had plenty of people in it. So naturally I found the highest level guild that would take me with the least vacancies. 

Hindsight... Stop booting inactive people. Make sure you only ever have one vacancy and when it's full boot the laziest. Never have two openings. Less likely to get some one.
