SkincareAddiction,fk6mmpq,t3_fgmzmg,1583907189.0,"This is a great start! It is going to come and go in terms of you feeling able to take better care of yourself (I also have clinical depression), but having a nice routine with good products Is great self care. I also recommend keeping some quality wipes (I like the burts bees ones!) by your bed for those days where you just can‚Äôt but still want a clean face in a flash. Hope you feel better!"

I know 100% I made the right decision to allow myself to grow and deal with my own issues, but it‚Äôs so tempting to reach out because it feels wrong even though I know it‚Äôs right. I want to get out there with other people, but I can‚Äôt let him go."
BreakUps,ffsld6l,t3_eutjg0,1580184585.0,I feel this so much. I think it was the opposite situation for me where I was the one who was treated badly. Hopefully she feels just as sad as you do (I know I do) and is willing to forgive. I believe strongly that we must forgive and forget. Life is too short otherwise. Best of luck
depression_help,ffecd8r,t3_esogi3,1579842955.0,"Hi there. I struggle with the exact same thing. It‚Äôs so frustrating because I feel so good sometimes, but I know I‚Äôm just going to fall right back into that dark space. I try to handle one day at a time. Thinking too much about how I will feel tomorrow or next week only makes it worse. You can also try journaling how you feel, see if there‚Äôs any triggers, and test what helps in those moments. I always reach out to a friend or family member or I meditate, things like that. Hope this helps!"
depression_help,ffec4zt,t3_esk0py,1579842744.0,"Hi friend- as a girl who ended it with her depressed boyfriend, I felt a lot of guilt. I have my own mental health issues and him pushing me away more and more was too much to handle. I knew I needed the space to deal with my own state and let him sort himself out too. It‚Äôs been 2 months, and still a solid amount of the time I want to die or fall asleep and never wake up, but it gets better. I always think of the phrase ‚Äúthis too shall pass.‚Äù It feels horrendous, but it‚Äôs just a whole bunch of neurons firing off in your brain trying to protect itself. Let her have space and give a lot to yourself. You don‚Äôt need someone else to get through this dark time, you just have to be your own best friend. Good luck and if you need anything I‚Äôm here."

depression,fd6lwvd,t1_fd4v5k5,1578192907.0,"Coming from the other perspective, as in I was the one who broke up with my boyfriend over this same issue, believe me it hurt just as much. I‚Äôm an absolute wreck over it- I tried so hard to help but I think I made it worse by trying to inadvertently ‚Äúfix‚Äù him. He won‚Äôt talk to me now and I feel so guilty, but I also know I have my own problems and I couldn‚Äôt handle his and my own. I hope you find happiness and if you want someone to talk with, I‚Äôd be happy to. Best wishes"
depression,fd6jk0r,t3_ek3uky,1578192014.0,"Hi there- I‚Äôm going through a similar breakup, but there was no cheating. It‚Äôs made me feel deeply depressed and given me constant anxiety and panic attacks so I hear you. The only thing I can say is it‚Äôs been more than a month for me now and you just have to take it day by day. It‚Äôs similar to grief where it‚Äôs a process that comes and goes in its difficulty. It also might feel better to be mad at her, but in my opinion, I feel better keeping positive thoughts rather than adding anger to my sadness. Hope you are ok tonight my friend :)"
depression,fd6iwx6,t1_fd5wdyr,1578191733.0,"Hi friend- sounds similar to how I feel. But finding a good psychiatrist/therapist is so crucial. You should look into other people near you since it sounds like they‚Äôre more detrimental than helpful. If you can get that sorted, I promise that will make a difference. Good luck!"

relationship_advice,fbzomre,t3_ef9m1k,1577254161.0,"This is super similar to what I‚Äôm going through, but I‚Äôm in the no contact/healing phase. I broke up with him due to his personal issues/mental health struggles to take the pressure off. I‚Äôm hoping he reaches out when he is ready. Obviously you are ready now, and should absolutely reach out. If he says no, then you know it‚Äôs not meant to be for now and maybe try being single for a while to make sure you know who you are. If he says yes, then great! Either way, you get something good out of it. Good luck!"
