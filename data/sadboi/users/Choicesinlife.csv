As morbid as it sounds, if my current relationship ends, ending my life sounds pretty appealing. I have no motivation or drive to do things, my creativity is gone, I'm tired all the time, I'm fat and too lazy and dumb to lose weight. Tired of the upkeep, tired of trying and trying. I've had my tries at life and I think I'm just done. People act like I have other choices but I don't, I feel so helpless and powerless."

It sucks cause I was getting closer and closer to my 200 lbs goal, I was down to 225 and I just let myself go. Stopped going to the gym, stopped running and swimming, stopped counting my calories... I became so unhealthy, my excuses were that school and lack of a job were stressing me out, but I'm killing myself slowly with this shit.

I just can't stop eating though, my appetite is near unending. I don't understand why I can eat so much, I never feel satisfied and when I'm in a bad mood it's even worse."

It makes me feel guilty cause I know I'm just trying to control her, I have my reasons for my insecurities but it's not entirely fair towards her when I hound her over certain things. I don't know, I end up gaslighting myself and telling myself I'm being unreasonable to try and calm myself down. It's a mess."

Not in a literal vision sense, but in a mental sense on how I'm perceiving things. If I start panicking really bad, I'll even close my eyes and my whole existence starts to float/wander, like I'm not real.

Typing this up makes it sound kind of cool, but it's really not. It's an awful empty feeling where my brain would rather me not exist than be where
 I  was."

Mine split up when I was 5 and I honestly cannot remember probably 90% of my childhood, which I'm going to guess it's because of that. Not only did they split up, my mom moved across the country and separated from me for over 6 months... My parents/grandparents thought it would be a great idea to film my mom leaving, that memory doesn't exist in my brain but watching myself scream and cry as she drove away makes me grit my teeth and tear up just typing/thinking about it.

Like I get it, everyone is trying their best. Most people who are parents aren't going to be the best parents. Mine do try, but they, especially my mother, fumbled so damn hard when I was too young. They tell me I was a happy sociable and extremely confident kid when I was younger. But when my mom moved away and I started school, I was just so angry all the damn time. That anger turned into reclusive behavior when I hit puberty and now I'm just a depressed loser."
BPD,fomq6ej,t1_fompo1i,1587899831.0,"The therapist/councilor/whatever my school had was absolutely useless.

Like I'm a confused young adult who wants to kill himself because he feels like he has no other options, please stop trying to pry answers out of me. I tried to be as honest as possible but he kept hitting me with so many ""why's"". Like I was gonna just sit up and go ""Aha!"" and solve my own problems.

But then again, I've had little to no luck with therapists. I think it has to do with my issues with authority in general. I had one when I was a teenager that I did work well with and poured my soul out to, but she snapped me out of it when she couldn't take my insurance anymore and cut contact. Made me feel like the whole thing was just fake, therapists only care about you for the hour you're paying them then you're done. Just made me long for someone to genuinely care about me even more, I guess.

I miss all of my friends who have either moved away or are too busy. I miss socializing, making new friends.

Maybe it's the depression, but man do I lack any desire or drive outside of being happy or even just content. I don't care about a fancy career or a fancy anything. Of course I'd like nice things, but I think most of all I just want to love and be loved, as cheesy as that sounds.

I was constantly suicidal during university and that useless degree I worked for has so far given me nothing in return. I also haven't gotten hired since I took a break from working to focus on my last semester. I was starting to get so damn stressed and constantly going to bed wishing I was dead because I wasn't getting hired. 

Ever since this quarantine has started, all of that stress has been momentarily lifted, like a fog has disappeared. It feels so good to not have to worry about that stuff for the time being, I just get to help out around the house and do my own thing. And I'm feeling rather good just doing that."

I think I do bring out the best in people around me, if they really do try and talk to me on a ""real"" level. Maybe that's narcissistic of me to say, but from my experience it's true. I'm still on good terms with most of my exes, maybe I'm just a loser with a heart of gold. I can't really ever know, since I'm always in the inside looking out.

It's maddening and absolutely destroying  not only my self esteem but any semblance of motivation I have left. Last Thur I had an interview I thought I absolutely rocked and it was a part time position at a place near me that I would love to work for. They told me they'd get back to me by Monday with a response, guess they can't even be bothered to reject me with an actual message. I'm not even applying to fancy positions anymore, I'm so desperate I'm applying to fast food restaurants. 

I've even interviewed for unpaid internships in my field that I have a degree in and I've been ghosted by them too. I have zero drive in me left and all I do is dissapoint the people around me. I honestly believe I deserve better than this, because I am actually trying, but the world makes me feel like there's something wrong with me."
China_Flu,fjzk3zh,t1_fjzibgy,1583721609.0,"Look up @phdparody on Twitter, no clue the validity of the claims or whatever but that user has a bunch of videos claiming to be covering stuff going on in China and Iran."
China_Flu,fjysc0x,t1_fjyrsne,1583703539.0,There's been a handful of them from Iran too.
China_Flu,fjx7qla,t1_fjv4b2e,1583660770.0,"Yup everyone I've talked to about this stuff and they just dismiss it because we ""don't know the full context"" or how old the video is, or where it's from. I think people are dismissive because they're scared or don't want to think about it. I'm terrified, my GF lives just outside of Toronto and this shit is keeping me up. I'm trying my best not to panic though, but it's frustrating that people around me are covering their eyes and ears over this."
China_Flu,fjwv8x8,t1_fjwux8e,1583646748.0,"I haven't gone since so I'm not sure if they've restocked, they probably have, just last Sat they were out of those things when I went. It's not my membership so I can't get in without my family."
China_Flu,fjl8bpm,t3_fdvc37,1583441867.0,"My dad had to travel across the US because of a family emergency, I'm praying nothing happens to him. Such unfortunate timing."
antiwork,fjjq4k2,t1_fjjizub,1583408250.0,Yeah couldn't think of the word but it was one of the elective courses.
antiwork,fjji8fm,t1_fjjhu3m,1583397281.0,"No clue what her major was, but this was a Latin American history class."
antiwork,fjfgxe0,t1_fjffcsj,1583291574.0,"I have nothing to really gain over making this up, people weren't whooping and hollering over what the girl said but we were having a discussion about illegal immigration and people who agreed with her clapped and nodded after she said that, as they did with most people who went back and forth with this.

 I just thought the cognitive dissonance was astounding, that people thought bringing up their own families experience exploiting people would be a good argument for letting illegal immigrants stay. This was in SoCal by the way, in a Latin American history class, the teacher herself was a self proclaimed ex-illegal."
antiwork,fjeogx8,t1_fjen62s,1583275551.0,"What's insane is that it was a Latin American history class, with actual immigrants in it."
conspiracy,fjehgrd,t1_fjd5ujq,1583271735.0,"Not to mention getting the flu and/or pneumonia sucks even if it's not deadly to you. This dismissive hand waving crap is frustrating. Just because you believe it won't happen to you doesn't mean it can't. There's no reason to panic either, but to be so dismissive is just ignorant."
antiwork,fje5j8t,t1_fjdkgay,1583265641.0,"It's the boomer way, truly. I remember in one of my university classes the topic of illegal immigration was brought up. Some ditzy chick actually said ""My dad wouldn't have his business if it weren't for illegal immigrants."" as if it were something to be proud of. People clapped and agreed with her, it's insane that we allow others to exploit people in need like this and even crazier that people think it's brave/something to cheer over. Because you know that her father isn't paying them a livable wage, just like Andrew here.

This behavior also ruins American lives too because that's one less local job. Outsourcing is a greedy cancer."
antiwork,fjcmwoh,t3_fcm0ah,1583227235.0,"I've come to terms that I'm pretty lazy and uncreative, I enjoy just doing my own thing, working out, chilling with friends in real life or online.

It sucks I don't have more potential, but it is what it is. Just sucks I'm seen as a waste of life unless I'm killing myself at some near useless job."
antiwork,fjcmoap,t1_fj9iqr9,1583226900.0,"Boomers and Gen X simply don't get it, they lived in a time where you could literally walk to a company, shake someone's hand and be set for life. It's crazy hearing some of their stories on how underqualified they were doing certain jobs, my friends grandfather literally walked into NASA one day and became a rocket mechanic despite no schooling."
antiwork,fjcm2kd,t1_fja33py,1583226059.0,"I've seen a few of these too, it's insane."
China_Flu,fjbzuao,t1_fjb6z37,1583205125.0,"Here in SoCal the nearest Costco we go to is out of anything useful, went with my family and didn't really come back with much. Been trying to convince them to go earlier but it seems like it's too late now, I think we're good on food for a few weeks but not having rice sucks."
antiwork,fj8xi6w,t1_fj8ce3y,1583125019.0,And if you answer one of their questions wrong it spits you out already. And you're one of 200+ applicants. Also they won't bother getting back to you if they're not interested.
antiwork,fj8xaj5,t1_fj8u2kc,1583124840.0,After being basically forced to waste years of my life and go into thousands of dollars in debt I've gone nowhere. Even with my degree I seem to be unhirable and now my parents are realizing that my degree is basically useless. Now I'm useless.
SuicideWatch,fj8x3yh,t1_fi5qpno,1583124686.0,"I have a few people near that care, but if I get sent away to other family I'll have no friends and almost zero support. Applied to around 100 jobs this month and haven't gotten anything, the fire under my ass burns hotter and hotter. My parents want the best for me but it just comes off like I'm a failure."
BPD,fhk0cd6,t3_f100id,1581661555.0,"Yes, but when I'm with my FP I feel at home. It's so intoxicating and unhealthy but it's really the only thing stopping me from offing myself at this point.

I don't know why but your title reminds me of this memory. There was this one girl I was FWBs with and we both were ""catching feelings"" and decided that it shouldn't go on anymore. We were chilling in my car as we were talking and I just broke down, my brain haywired and I kept repeating ""I don't want to go home"". Pretty sure I freaked her out pretty bad with that, but I was just petrified of going home. 

But it wasn't and isn't because my home is awful, it's because I feel like I have no home. I have no place where I fit in. I was starting to get attached to this person and my brain melted away at the thought of removing that safety net. It's probably why I let myself go through so much abuse, I cling on to my partners with all of my life, almost literally.

I honestly hate it because then I gaslight myself into letting people who shouldn't stay in my life stay. Because I don't belong anywhere, I don't deserve anything better.

Think it's routed in childhood trauma, my parents splitting up fucked me up. I've been told I used to scream that I wanted to see the other parent and not be at the current ones house. The constant moving and losing friends didn't help either. Now I'm a social outcast loser."
BPD,fhiy7vk,t3_f32ey9,1581634237.0,"Yup, when I start disassociating I tend to close my eyes and just imagine nothing. Just serene peace, me being gone will temporarily hurt some people but I'm convinced it'd make everyones lives easier in the end. I'm a loser who isn't going anywhere in life, I've tried my best but my best isn't anywhere near acceptable. Just waiting for my GF to eventually break up with me so I can end it all. I'm just so tired and desperately want peace, my brain is a constant battlefield yet I have no good reason to even be this down. I'm broken and spoiled, worthless.

Just want to sleep all the time, such a nice state of mind. No worries, nothing I'm forced to deal with, nothing at all. Just seems perfect."
BPD,fhixe4e,t1_fhiwyuc,1581633752.0,"People always say to reach out, but those are just words. I reach out all the damn time, almost blindly. I'm constantly asking for help and people just walk on by, shrugging at best."
BPD,fhiuifn,t3_f38zld,1581632097.0,I use this account to vent and try to reach out. I have many posts I've deleted because nobody cares. It's nice to vent but it hurts when nobody says anything.
antiwork,fh2c23r,t1_fgr2fhr,1581245491.0,"I had an interview that went sour because I accidentally slipped out that I had student loans. They asked what my current short term goals are and I said something along the lines of ""Getting hired, making more connections, improving my skills with customer interactions, I also recently graduated from university so starting on loan payments would be nice.""

The interviewers demeanor changed immediately, saying that they ""Don't appreciate individuals that only apply for the money""... Like dude, this is a job at FedEx where I pick up boxes and organize paper. That was one of my first interviews ever and I quickly learned to just bullshit everything because honesty is not a virtue to these soulless people."
