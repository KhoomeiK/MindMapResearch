AskPhysics,fqvslal,t3_gl236t,1589684238.0,"I've felt I've developed maturity in physics, just to have that feeling swept away at some moment so many times that I have lost count. I am nearing the end of my PhD and have been in a physics program for the last ten years give or take. The thing with physics is that it is so broad that there is always something new to learn. The most impressed I have ever been was hearing a 70 year old Harvard professor talk about a variety of topics with great depth. Even then I'm sure he would feel he is lacking in certain areas, but I say this not to discourage you, but to hopefully make you realize that you can always learn more. And that's probably how your physics career will go if you choose to stay with it."

I think continuing on your degree would be the best path since you're already in your third year and if you feel that physics isn't really for you you might be able to apply to some other technical field for a master's degree and hopefully find something you like. There are also a lot of non tech jobs that hire people with physics degree because of all the problem you learn to do. But you should do what you feel is best for you in the end.
