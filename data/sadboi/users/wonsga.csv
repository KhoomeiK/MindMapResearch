depression,fkvw2ey,t3_fkzsim,1584577942.0,"I think it all depends on your biology. People react differently to different things, so nothing is really ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. 

For example, a lot of people use Benadryl to help them sleep. But for me, it has the opposite affect. I get super energized, like I just injected caffeine or something. This is my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but not other people‚Äôs.

I would say keep going with Wellbutrin unless the side affects are interfering with your day too much. Or if it makes you feel worse (obviously).



(Side story ‚Äî not really a reply to what you asked, but I just feel like telling my experience) 

Wellbutrin is the only medication I‚Äôve taken. They put me on a 150mg dose, same as you. For the first couple days I didn‚Äôt feel any different. Then as I kept taking more doses I started feeling even less motivated, which is crazy because my motivation was basically at zero. I started staying in bed all, only getting out to go to the bathroom. I stopped eating, and started scaring myself with my thoughts. Once I realized it was probably the medication I stopped taking it. After a couple days I was back to how I felt before taking it, which wasn‚Äôt great but it was still better than when I was on it. At this point I‚Äôm scared to try any other medications. I want to see a psychiatrist but still waiting to get an appointment."
depression,fku9tdn,t3_fkqz87,1584545257.0,"People who do not have depression, will never understand people who do. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve learned very quickly. It‚Äôs a tough pill to swallow, knowing that not very many people will understand what you‚Äôre going through. I struggled for while when I realized this. Then I realized that there is a whole group of people who have gone through, or are going through the same thing as me. 

It might be hard to see now, but there are people who truly understand what you‚Äôre going through. My advice to you is to keep trying with your loved ones. It may hurt to see the ways they react, but after months and months of trying to get through my own family I think I‚Äôm finally getting through to them that it‚Äôs not something I control. If it was, it wouldn‚Äôt exist.

Find help, wherever it may come from :)"
depression,fktmdjb,t3_fkn1y8,1584526418.0,"If it‚Äôs your family doctor (just regular MD or PA) then after you tell them what you think is going on then they‚Äôll probably do a quick survey thing. It‚Äôs not very detailed, and not very helpful (in my opinion.) They will probably prescribe medication,  ask you to see a psychiatrist, or both. 

In my case they did both, but the medication they gave me made it worse and I still haven‚Äôt even gotten an appointment to see a psychiatrist. I‚Äôve been trying to get one since early December.

So to sum up my point, this is a good first step. But ultimately it‚Äôs not the best thing you can do. If they give you medication, try it. If you feel worse stop taking it. If they want you to go see a psychiatrist, don‚Äôt have a laissez-faire attitude about it. Push as hard as you can to get into one, because if you don‚Äôt you might end up in the same boat as me."

Now it‚Äôs been over 3 months and I still haven‚Äôt even set up and appointment to see a psychiatrist. And once I get an appointment it may still take up to 2 months until I can actually get one. So long story short I went to my doctor to talk about it and I may end up waiting 6 months to actually see someone about it.

But I can try and answer your second question. 

When I was younger my gf was going through depression. I know it was very hard on her. I said a lot of things that I thought would make it better or forget about. Now that I‚Äôm going through depression myself, I realize how awful what I was saying was. (I apologized to her a couple months ago, luckily she appreciated it. She even said that she was just glad I tried).

Anyways, what I‚Äôm trying to say if you AREN‚ÄôT going through depression, don‚Äôt try and understand it. It‚Äôs extremely difficult, maybe even impossible, to understand what it actually is like. Just be there for him/her. Tell them that you don‚Äôt understand what they‚Äôre going through, but you‚Äôre there to support them however they need."
