Coronavirus,fpr1st0,t3_gekees,1588839368.0,"Does anybody have any information regarding suicide rates over the last two months of lockdown?

Having looked at historical suicide rates, it seems that almost a fifth of COVID-related deaths could come from suicides. I'll explain my (probably poor) logic:

In the last serious economic downturn (the Great Depression) suicide rates in the US increased from 13.4 people per 100,000 in 1917 to 21.9/100,000 in 1932 - an increase of 63%. In 2017, the suicide rate was 14/100,000, taking us to an *estimate* of 22ish/100,000 suicides if the same rates apply to this economic downturn (I would actually argue that it could be significantly worse this time with the added effects of quarantine, there are already numerous anecdotal cases of committing suicide just because of mental health related issues stemming from quarantine). 

In the US, that would therefore represent an *increase* of around 23,000 suicides in 2020. If Trump's estimates of 100,000 COVID deaths is correct (which is up for debate), then suicides would represent an extra 23%(ish) deaths related to COVID.

This was just a little thought I had and wanted to do the maths and I was pretty surprised - if anyone has any comments, I'd be happy to hear them."

It never was. At least Flamengo seem to have someone in charge who cares about football and winning competitions. So many Brazilian clubs seem to be farming footballers for Europe.

In Talles Magno (see https://youtu.be/DpwdxgS90Xs for just how cheeky this kid is) and to a slightly lesser extent Marrony, Vasco have two more potential sources of big income in the next year or two.

It will be safe enough but you're barely in Paris (literally about 50m from the border and already on the wrong side of the peripherique). But you're close enough to the Line 12 - I'm at the other end of the Line 12 and I've never had a problem with it, I consider it one of the more reliable metro lines. Just depends if there is a strike - then the 12 (along with 80% of the lines) will be completely closed and tis the season to be striking in Paris right now.

You're very close to Aquaboulevard which would be nice during the summer but is a bit redundant at this time of the year.

I used to live in Malakoff, not too far from that area and what I would say is it's very quiet, which for me was nice during the week but became a little frustrating at the weekend. Coming back from inside the city means leaving Paris at 12/1am to get the last metro back or paying for a taxi or Uber (I'd say around €30, likely more depending where you are - I was once quoted over €40 to go back from Montmartre, fortunately I had friends to stay with)."
