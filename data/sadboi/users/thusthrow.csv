EatingDisorders,foepcbd,t3_g2z40o,1587710300.0,"My boyfriend is somewhat like this too, he does like to actually eat breakfast but can go hours before he does. I don't feel like my body even starts until I at least have a piece of toast with some coffee. 

Maybe, while you're preparing breakfast for yourself you can offer him something small? Or ask him if you can make his coffee? And you can bring him his coffee with a little piece of fruit , and you eat your normal breakfast. If that's the way you guys do breakfast, that is absolutely fine. I'm assuming he wants you to be comfortable anyways, and if eating will make you more comfortable and energetic he would want you to do that.  You needing a decent meal to start your day is just as acceptable and normal as having only a cup of coffee.

Like, are you a morning showering person or a nighttime ? Why should you be embarrassed about either of those options? You got to get clean, and look good, and have fun doing it! Do what works best for you and makes you comfortable."

Complaining about her endometriosis, and how she forgets to eat when she's at home, and she should totally be skinny by now, but her body is just in Starvation mode all the time because she keeps forgetting to eat! And now that we're all in remote work, she's forgetting ALL the time. 

She also goes out of her way to make me feel/sound dumb, it's annoying. Likes to correct me on all things food and nutrition, makes fun of the things I eat, and the things haven't eaten. 

Told her I like iceberg lettuce. "" Oh gosh that's disgusting, it's literally just fiber and water oh, don't you know what tastes good?"" 

Told me she actually hates the taste of cream cheese, but is obsessed with the texture oh, so therapeutically she'll just eat corn chips and cream cheese. Like the whole tub. - but she emphasized, "" it's not about the flavor, I actually don't like the flavor, the creaminess oh, that's whatever, it's ALL about the texture.""

And that's her snack guys. 

I'm also trying to lose 10 lbs, mentioned it to a couple other coworkers who are also trying to lose weight. It's like she short circuits if that's brought up. Which it rarely is. 

On top of all that, she smells bad, a lot of the time."
dating_advice,fl4c69n,t1_fl3y5cd,1584810437.0,"The fact that you are concerned about being boring to your girlfriend is amazing. Like, you sound very caring and that is somewhat rare. 

Honestly, just talk about what you like, whatever makes you passionate, whatever you're interested in, talk about it with her. Even if that's not necessarily her cup of tea, that shows confidence, and everyone's attracted to that.

And I'm a big believer in saving moments like that for when you're in person. Otherwise, you're going to be sharing moments like this via text, and that does not build attraction and connection, like it would if you were in person. But there's no solid rules right now. 

If you feel it's worth it to keep dating, you could give it a shot, but don't get your hopes up for now, we're all in a weird situation."
dating_advice,fl4auqu,t3_fmff17,1584809650.0,"If you can't see each other, you can talk on the phone, and video chat.

This would be a great time to get to know each other on a more deeper level, and it's a freaking pandemic, so it shows you how the other person is going react under situations of stress, and what resources you both have in your Arsenal to support each other and yourselves.

Honestly, right now is a really hard time to date, and everyone's safety and well-being should be top priority. If you both see it worth it to stick it out, you'll find a way to do it, you can be creative with it too. 

I think if you can't see each other, then now would be a good time to maybe meet people online, get to know them, and plan to meet up when all of this blows over. It might be a big waste of time, due to the frequency of people becoming texting buddies and nothing more. But nobody knows what's going to happen day by day, so there's no solid rules here. 

The suspense of finally meeting up in person could be nice too."

This confirms that the person isn't creepy, or has incredibly ill intentions, also confirms that they're not coming off as desperate. That's a good start if anything."
