Slaves could free themselves from ownership, but the repercussions of failing were very bad, similar to suicide if it fails. There have been a lot of people who've escaped slavery (you can search this up and read about them yourself), denying that is ignorance. 

> You are not owned by anyone else. 

The government.

> You are not property in the eyes of the law

Then why can the government hold me against my will in a psychiatric ward for 72 hours or in suicide watch as long as they want? And why can they draft me as a soldier against my will and tax me against my will?"
