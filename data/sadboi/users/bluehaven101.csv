Here's a bit of a rant.

I was reading today that Madagascar are shipping boxes of, I think it's a drink, called Covid Organics - which is made from the artemisia plant, to other African countries. Artemisia, from reading a BBC article is what some antimalarial drugs are made out of apparently. 

Now the ""WHO"" have come out previously and said that people shouldn't take herbal medicine. The same WHO who has political ties to China and denied Covid-19 transmits from person to person. They say that this drink has no evidence of working.

My question is, why haven't there been proper scientific, peer reviewed studies on herbal medicine...like ever? Or at least it's never publicised.

A lot of herbal medicine work... Honey & lemon works for cold, ginger / garlic work for something. Tumeric and CBD or Hemp oil works for dealing with inflammation. So could this Covid Organics drink , it could work.

I just think why is stuff like this being poo pooed by Western medical boards? At least try do studies on why some of these treatments work, honey & lemon clearly works but why? ""It's a mystery"". How can there be evidence if no one's looking some? 

I get the stance of telling the public not to take anything to treat Covid-19 for health & safety reasons. But shouldn't that just apply for disinfectants & bleach or other drugs with side effects? Not stuff that has helped a community for 1000s of years (I mean in general).

I'm probs missing something obvious and someone's gonna say something to make me feel stupid. I get it, but just had to say this."

MMA,fmugkep,t3_fwzfgk,1586390987.0,"Hey, I've got this idea on judging , let me know what you think...

You got 5 judges, each specialises in either striking, wrestling, BJJ, grappling and kick boxing. Each judge focuses on + makes notes on what the fighters are doing when they are doing their chosen speciality. As well as judging in general if the fighters aren't fighting in the judges speciality.

After the fight, they go to the back, sit down in a room. Discuss openly in front of the camera about the fight, share notes, share insights. Ask questions about the other's speciality. Then they vote anonymously, separate rooms, via electronic device and decide who won the fight having considered everything.

Bruce buffer gets alerts on his phone, notifying what judge gave a point to what fighter. When all 5 judges have submitted their vote, Bruce buffer announces the winner. 

Scoring would look like, 2-3, 3-2, 4-1... regardless if it's a 3 round fight or 5, points depended on no. of judges and not rounds."

How will he do? It's a 50/50 but AJ will have no fear. Fury said that AJ beat the shit out of him in sparring. 
It's interesting, Fury has more height and reach.

I feel AJ performs best when he's the underdog. He's been the underdog (in my eyes, not betting odds) in 3 fights. Against Charles Martin, Klitschko and Ruiz II. At each fight, he had evolved his game.

In the future, do you think other countries like Germany or France will leave the EU and we create another union, then more countries will leave the EU to join this new union, alongside countries that aren't in Europe?

In this scenario, I could see a war in Europe if / when the power shifts over to this new union, or will a war be unlikely and the EU fades into history?

Based on this scenario, it changes the meaning of being a remainer or leaver. If the EU goes downhill from here, why would you want to remain on a sinking ship?

As a remainer, I'd feel more comfortable voting leave if it meant other countries left at the same time and created a new union.

AskReddit,fdl1k7b,t1_fdky5rb,1578515445.0,"I like what Disney+ did with the mandalorian, released an ep every week. If they didn't *spoiler* wouldn't have been such a huge thing since the thing was revealed at the end of the first ep and it  lingered for a week. I feel Netflix could benefit a lot from considering a weekly episode or 2 eps per week model for some shows - shows that are pretty consistent every episode in terms of quality.

But I felt the Witcher had to be dropped in one go  because the episodes were structured a bit weirdly, but made sense at the end.

What's really annoying are 24 ep shows like the flash... Wish they were shorter or dropped a block of eps in one go."
