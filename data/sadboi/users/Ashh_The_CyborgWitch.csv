socialism,fr1pseq,t1_fr19819,1589823880.0,"it is absolutely your choice to go hardcore anti-establishment and live in the forest in a cabin you built out of ethically sourced wood or band together with a few other socialists/anarchists and build a commune on some acquired piece of land.

all i'm saying is that it's not your fault for being a part of a system spanning hundreds of years in the making where each individual has almost zero responsibility for perpetuating said system. 

i'm sure you struggle enough with thinking about your housing, livelihood, love life, friendships, family life, medical issues, finances, recycling etc... it's not your fault for being a human.

but if you want to eschew the system and be one of the people who are conscientious objectors in praxis, that's good on you. but i think the real path to revolution here isn't actually revolution as such , but a gradual change from capitalism. it's how we arrived at capitalism. we came here thru feudalism and imperalism, and it wasn't overnight.

i don't think we will see the end of capitalism in our lifetime. maybe in 50 years? maybe in 200 years. we've had capitalism for 300-400 years, so.... this will take *time* to undo. we've been fighting against capitalism for like 150 years."

the only way to survive this meaningless existence is to construct a narrative that makes you want to see the dawn of the next day.

life doesn't have an ""end goal"", but it's funny how we're basically socialized into believing that.

Calvinists believe that God predestined some people to be saved and others were predestined to eternal damnation. This choice by God to save some is held to be unconditional and not based on any characteristic or action on the part of the person chosen.

so in the eyes of Calvinists, life is basically meaningless too since whatever they do with their life, they'll either be saved or damned, and no one knows who will be saved except God. so it doesn't matter if they're good people or bad people. which kind of nullifies the existence of God if you ask me.... it's an interesting juxtaposition to other kinds of Christianity, as well as to atheism.

&#x200B;

in my opinion, existence is just a self-organizing ""thing"" and we don't have any free will to change it, it just feels like we possess some kind of volition with which we can affect reality and our own destiny but that's just for show and the only thing we can really do is observe what unfolds in front of our eyes and use the power of our imagination to construct narratives that make us less.... insane.

i actually saw a video on youtube the other day that tied into ""life purpose"" in an interesting way:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5bEQC6TTeM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5bEQC6TTeM)
