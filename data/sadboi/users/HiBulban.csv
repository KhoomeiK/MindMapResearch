My advise is to speak to your bf and tell him firmly that he needs to start standing up to his mother and protect you. It might mean big sacrifices depending on how stubborn his mother is, sometimes he will have to reduce communication or cancel entire trip if his mother is not cooperating. 

Plz trust me on this, I know this all too well from personal experience if your bf doesn’t stick up for you around his mother, his family will never respect you they will mistreat you and walk all over you, and it is also proof that his own mother is priority over you. His habit will also change after marriage and he will take on similar behaviour from his mother and channel it onto you  

You are who you are, it’s their problem not your problem if others can’t accept your condition. I also advise that you don’t go on this trip

If you're mobile enough (you can walk etc with no issues) You'll be ok, try to delay the relocation as much as you can maybe get in touch with your new employer and then just do the following to reduce clotting risks:

1. Get compression socks and wear them before you get on the plane
2. Fly biz class if you can for better space and movement of your legs, plus you don't have to be sitting all the time, take the connecting flight so you can move around the airport.
3. walk around
4. take your Xarelto
5. take info for hospital and medical arrangements in netheralands in advance so you are prepared for follow ups
6. be careful not to fall or injure yourself as not to bleed out (Xarelto is not reversible)

Also hydrate yourself a lot
