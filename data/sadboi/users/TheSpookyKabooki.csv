Our store's co-manager used to come in with a giant bag of Krystal's, head straight back to the management office and spend the next several hours of her shift horking them down. Another manager spent all his time sneaking out the back door in the stockroom so he could hang out and chain smoke. A third spent all her time gossiping with some of the grocery stockers. 

And if they didn't like you for whatever reason, they would actually screw up the workflow for the store by moving you to a department you didn't know. One of the managers decided she didn't like me, so she dragged me out of the stockroom that I knew backwards and forwards, and put me out on the sales floor. She made me switch with a softlines/clothing stocker who knew absolutely nothing about the stockroom.

I'm sure you can imagine how much work these fish out of water accomplished that shift."

They wouldn't let us in until we agreed to surrender our IDs at the desk; we could stop and pick them up on our way back out. It was frustrating and the fact that they put workers on to tail us combined with the numerous screaming snot goblins running around just ruined any fun I might have had.

This stuff didn't work for me at all and, in fact, only gave me side effects. I started the drug weighing 120lbs and ended the drug weighing 190+... and I gained that weight fast. Every monthly psych visit felt like I'd gained 10lbs. It's recommended that you take Latuda at night before you go to bed so it can help you sleep, but you're also supposed to take it with 350+ calories. Not a good combination for maintaining a healthy weight.

Beyond that, it gave me restless legs, made me antsy when I needed to be sleeping, upped the speed on my thoughts, stiffened my jaw, and gave me muscle tremors. It did nothing for my brain fog or my depression, and when I tried to tell my doctor that it was only making things worse, he just changed my dosage around. Still didn't help.

And I was thinking these sorts of thoughts as young as 8. 

I was also convinced that I had a demon attached to me and that was why I was so awful and everyone knew it and didn't like me. I believed I must have been an alien, that I came from a completely different planet. Sometimes I would talk and talk, and I'd speak so fast people couldn't understand me because all my words were running together, and I'd tell wild stories and I wouldn't sleep.

Paranormal,fd6a2a5,t3_ejx5rt,1578187820.0,"I've experienced something similar and I still do not have an explanation for it.

About ten years ago, when I was in my mid-20's and still lived in Atlanta, a few of my friends and I liked to go to this one park in the middle of the night during the summer. We'd go and hang out, and have a great time on the playground. The park was fairly large and close to the main road that ran through that neighbourhood; you could see the road from the playground. To get into the park from the parking lot, you had to walk across a wooden bridge and the park area itself was on a sort of island surrounded by a wide creek.

One night, it was only three of us: J, R, and myself. We spent about three hours playing on the equipment before we decided to head back to the apartment we all shared. The whole evening, we'd heard the standard summer night noises: dogs barking in the distance, cicadas, bullfrogs in the creek, the hum of car engines from the main road. It felt like a regular night, at least until we got back on the bridge.

As soon as the three of us set our feet on the bridge, it was like all the sound in the world vanished. No more bullfrogs, no dogs barking, no cicadas. We could still see cars passing on the main road, could see their headlights--but we didn't hear a sound, not even our own breathing. As one, we all froze and looked at each other, and we just stood perfectly still for about ten seconds.

And then we all bolted. We raced across the bridge, hopped in the car as fast as we could, and tore out of the parking lot. The weird thing was, as soon as our feet touched the ground on the other side of the bridge, all the sound rushed back into the world. Suddenly, we could hear all the regular summer night noises. 

The whole way home, we were all silent and it wasn't until we were back in our living room that we started talking again. None of us had any idea what might have caused that, but we all experienced it at the same time. And we still don't have any clue."

creepyPMs,faorib5,t3_ea4qst,1576270924.0,"When I was 18 and had my first job in a tiny grocery store, this older man (40-50) came in every morning, 8A on the dot. And every morning, he bought the exact same thing: a can of hominy and two bananas. He came through my line a few times and I thought nothing of it... until he took to choosing my line every time. If I already had customers, he'd still stand in my lane, even when other cashier's offered to check him out. He never said much of anything to me beyond the usual mumbled, ""G'morning."" 

But apparently, this guy was known for developing crushes on the young girls who worked in the store and the opening stages of his infatuation began with always choosing their checkout lanes. Another female co-worker told me about her experience with the guy; she said he had taken to following her around the store after the manager moved her from cashier to stocker.

I didn't pay much attention to it because I took a new job at a big box retailer down the street. I started there as a cashier and wouldn't you know it... this guy suddenly starts shopping there a few weeks after I started. I didn't notice him at first, at least until one evening when I ran one of the express lanes. 

A friend of mine was running the lane beside mine and it was a slow night, so we talked while we straightened the impulse merchandise. Somehow, we got on the topic of dating. This guy came to my lane and I started checking him out. While I was scanning, he looked me up and down, leered at me, and said, ""If I were about 20 years younger, I'd ask you out on a date. Heh heh.""

I was 18. Never had a boyfriend, never had a date. Shy, anxious, nervous around people. I don't remember what I responded with; all I can remember is static in my head while I scrambled for something polite to say that would shut that shit down without getting me fired.

For a couple of weeks after that, I had to cover morning shifts for another girl who had taken leave, so I didn't see the guy during that time because he only came in during the evening, somewhere between 6-8P. But when I returned to evening shifts, sure enough, there he was.

I worked the express lane again and here he came, like clockwork. While I scanned his stuff, he leaned in, smiled, and said, ""Hey there, China Doll. Missed you around here lately. Where you been?""

I said I had worked the morning shifts and he responded with something to the effect of buying an alarm clock so he could get up earlier. He left and I thought that was the end of that. But he broke his routine that night, and breaking from his usual route would become his new normal. He came back in about ten minutes later, walked up to my counter and asked me where he might find some Fix-a-Flat in the store. I'm not good with unexpected conversation and when I'm nervous, I tend to blurt the first thing that comes to mind.

So I said, ""If it has anything to do with a car, my first guess would be automotives."" He asked me where the automotive department was and I, unable to leave my register, pointed to the other side of this huge store. 

He followed the directions of my finger, whistled, shook his head, and said, ""Damn, all the way back there, huh. You think it's raining back there?""

Again, I was nervous and confused, so I blurted, ""Given there's a roof over the building, probably not."" 

He just laughed and sauntered off. A few minutes later, he comes back to my lane to check out instead of paying for his stuff at the automotive register. And even though I had a line of people, he refused to go to other, open registers.

After that, I was often moved around the store to fill in any spots where they needed someone. Stocking, other registers, furniture carries; you name it, I did it. Whenever that guy came in, he started wandering around the store, looking for me--when originally, he came in, bought a frozen pizza and some junk from the deli, and checked out without going to any of the other aisles. If he couldn't find me in the store, he'd sit on one of the benches near the entry/exit and just watch. And if I happened to get moved to a register after he had already checked out, he'd sit on the bench closest to my lane and stare at me for a few minutes.

Eventually, my manager heard about this and she asked me to point him out to her the next time he came in. Told me to page her to wherever I was as soon as I saw him. When I did and she finally got a look at the guy, she seemed horrified. I asked her why and she told me she went to high school with this dude. And even in high school, she said he was creepy and made girls uncomfortable with his staring and his weird comments. I don't know what she said to him when she marched right up to him, but I never saw the guy again."

writers,f1fpyo9,t1_f1fmpcj,1569450158.0,"The poem opens on a strong line: ""Bury me in your heartstrings / as there is no other place I'd like to sleep,"" but it doesn't continue with that image--it stops abruptly in order to force a rhyme. Given that the poem smacks heavily of a possible suicide note, that burial/sleep image could be carried even further by the addition of some image of drifting off to a lullaby. Applying that idea would draw both parts of those opening likes into the rest of the stanza because it married the themes of strings and sleeping, and also introduces the concept of separation the poem seems to be going for. Maybe talk about falling asleep beside that person and their breath, their heartbeat, their quiet, sleepy mumbles are all music that helped the speaker drift away.

A lot of the poem lacks those images and follow-throughs for the images that are introduced because it's too worried about forcing rhymes even as it often ignores the first stanza's established meter.

""When I'm gone, will you remember me? / Like I used to wait impatiently?"" The first line here is a great setup, but the second line falls flat. What was the speaker waiting impatiently for? How does waiting impatiently look on them? Do they bite their nails, tap their foot, drum their fingers on something, fidget with the hems of their clothing, twirl their hair around a finger? We don't know because there is no solid image to show us and connect us to the speaker. Why is the speaker waiting so impatiently? This feels like it needs a picture painted to ground readers in the moment and really make them feel what the speaker feels.

What memories of the addressee does the speaker have? We don't know; we're only told that memories exist. It's hard for the reader to relate because they're given no real examples of time spent with this person the speaker seems to mourn. What mistakes did the speaker make that they fear for their children? What did the speaker not learn then that they think they've learned now, and how did they learn it? What gate could they have stopped at and why? Why did they not stop at it?

While I appreciate the emotions and intrusive thoughts the poem tries to convey, the work fails to establish a connection. It fails to out me in the speaker's shoes because I have nothing solid here--only nebulous references that never go anywhere. There is an obvious longing and sadness here, but very little that really takes those emotions and forces me to feel them, too."

Imagine it as... the Snickers commercials that feature celebrities acting like complete assholes. Like the Betty White football ad. Her teammates pull her aside after she rails at some players and they're like, ""You're not acting right, man. Here, have this Snickers."" And Betty eats the candy bar, and suddenly, she's no longer raging Betty White. She's a chill guy who seems relieved as he thanks his friends for helping pull him out of that.

Then the voiceover plays and says, ""You're not you when you're hungry.""

It's a similar idea when you experience the drastic shifts in mood, behaviour, and thought processes that are bipolar. You are still you, but there are voices in your head that are not yours and they tell you, convince you of things that you would neither say nor believe when you aren't in the grip of an episode. It's not that you aren't you, but more that parts of you that you have the capacity to be and usually aren't--those bits are magnified.

And honestly, sometimes it feels like you're not even sitting in your own driver's seat anymore. Sometimes it feels like you really aren't you; you're strapped into the backseat while someone else mans the wheel and you don't have the ability to stop them until they've crashed the car and the impact has torn you from your restraints.

Imagine you are ordinarily a fairly quiet, private person. You like your own company and enjoy your solitude. You don't hate social interaction, but you don't normally go out of your way to seek it out. Then mania hits you and suddenly, you need to be the center of everyone's world. You have all these amazing ideas that could revolutionize everything you touch if people would only open their ears and eyes and give you the time of day. Instead of going home after work to enjoy your peace and quiet, you are inviting everyone out to drinks. You are prime entertainment and everyone is amazed by how outgoing you really are, when they thought you were a homebody.

And then, one day, all that energy and desire to be center stage vanishes. Now you don't want anything to do with anyone--even yourself. All you can hear when people talk to you is the recrimination for all the things you said when you were manic. All the stupid things you did, all the oversharing, everything catches up with you and you hate yourself. You've made a mess of everything. All your friends wonder what's wrong with you. You aren't the life of the party anymore. In a similar way as mania, it feels like you aren't quite in control of yourself. All these terrible thoughts pop into your head and you have no idea where they're coming from, but they're telling you the cold, hard truth.

And then comes the depersonalization, where nothing feels real, including you. Sometimes, it feels like you've forgotten who you were before the disease came. That now you're nothing more than an endless string of episodes, some more severe than others. It feels like you're on a seesaw and you're either the heavy kid or the scarecrow, and no one your size ever comes to sit on the other end and ride the seesaw with you.

And when you make those friends, you still have the presence of mind to tell them you have bipolar and you are about to hit your manic stride; you tell them so they'll know that the you they're about to meet isn't exactly -you-.

And then they still act surprised and upset when the mania passes and you either sink into depression or you just even out into the happy medium you. 

It's like, ""I told you this would happen. I gave you clear explanations about this behaviour and how markedly different it is from my usual self.""

And then I'm told, ""You just aren't acting like you.""

YES, I AM.

I hate this. :("

Then u get all sorts of nasty accusations about how I'm a bad friend and I don't talk to them enough.

And I'm thinking, ""But I was quiet because I didn't want to burden you with my issues."" Especially when I've tried to talk to them about my depression and paranoia, and they only become angry at me for feeling the way I feel.

I can definitely dig it."

BipolarReddit,etw5gnl,t3_cdpg7u,1563254679.0,"For me, mania is like... being the best thing that ever happened to this planet. I have all the ideas, all the energy I could ever need to accomplish my ideas. If I can imagine it, I can make it, do it, experience it, etc. And because I'm convinced I am the most amazing creature ever, I start thinking everyone else needs to sit up and pay attention to me. That if they'd only listen to what I have to say--which is mostly incoherent rambling about all the things going on in my head with no real segue between ideas/points--the world would be a better place. 

When I don't get the attention and admiration I'm so convinced I deserve, I get irritable and believe I am that misunderstood genius hermit hiding out in my cave and inventing all sorts of useful things and making art and music and writing that will revolutionize the world once it's found in the future by archaeologists. I would say they'd find it after I was dead, but by that point, I'm convinced I will never die because I am something beyond human. I'll just move on and leave all my great works behind for people to marvel over later, while I watch from somewhere else.

It starts out great. I get a great many neat things done and have plans for so many more. But eventually, the auditory and visual hallucinations start setting in and the lack of sleep only amplifies them. I see people who aren't there, I hear voices that make me extremely paranoid, and I become convinced that demons are following me; that they are just waiting for me to slip up even a little bit so they can hijack my body.

Once the paranoid delusions start rolling, mania isn't so fun anymore. And when it's over, I crash. The higher I fly, the farther I fall when the sun melts the wax in my wings. Mania seems wonderful when it starts, but you pay for it when it passes. Mania is like winning the jackpot in the lottery and depression is the tax collector."

bipolar,etrp72l,t1_etrey5l,1563126095.0,"I met a guy I intended to be friends with when I was ramping up into a full-blown mania and I could see the mania coming. The delusions hadn't hit yet, the psychosis hadn't crept up on me, but I noticed I was sleeping less and less yet still had plenty of energy and tons of ideas. So while I still had the self-awareness, I told my new friend of about a month, ""Hey, I have bipolar disorder type I."" He already knew I was studying to become a psychologist and dumped his claims of depression on me, so I thought it would be fine to explain my own illness and warn him that I was heading into a manic episode. I explained what that was like, how I get hyperfocused on things, irritable, energetic, don't sleep, I hallucinate, have delusions (especially of grandeur), extreme paranoia, etc.

His response involved romanticizing the illness and something about how he ""appreciated"" my darkness. I was too hyperfocused on my projects at the moment to give that a lot of thought. Full mania hit, he thought I was amazing, brilliant, and loved spending so much time with me. But when the mania passed and I was back to my quiet, I-barely-contact-anyone self--and later, crashing into a deep, suicidal depression--he was angry at me. Wondered where the ""real"" me went and when I tried to explain bipolar disorder to him, he became angry and said he understood it fine. He told me I was just being ""protective"" of my illness whenever I corrected his misconceptions--as if he thought I fancied myself some ""special snowflake"" because I had this disorder. I'm fairly sure his romanticizing the illness had a lot to do with that mindset.

He also told me that I could talk to him about anything. So I made the mistake of telling the truth about the nasty thoughts in my head during my depressive episode and I spoke honestly about the intrusive, suicidal thoughts. That made him angry and he proceeded to tell me how I shouldn't say things like that and how I was romanticizing suicide, and how he'd mentioned suicide once to a female friend some years ago and she became furious with him and cut off the friendship. He said that was a wake-up call for him and he stopped being suicidal because he lost a friendship over it. At some point down the line, he then proceeded to tell me he was sure he was becoming manic at work and he described his ""mania,"" which had none of the hallmarks of a manic episode.

It was more or less just him upset that I wasn't giving him attention while he was stuck at work and so, he played the anxiety card. 

Our friendship didn't last long. And for this reason, I hesitate to tell people about my disorder. I didn't start out the gate with it, but I want to be honest with potential friends, especially since I usually meet them when I'm manic or headed into a manic episode. I want to let them know that the person they've met is not necessarily the ""real"" person underneath the disease so they aren't blindsided when I am suddenly quiet, shy, and no longer the life of the party or always down for conversation about anything.

All this to say I understand the struggles. It's not easy to talk about with people because you never know what sort of reception you'll get. But I think it's an important conversation to have."

With Latuda, I experienced restless leg syndrome, massive weight gain, severe (and near constant) nausea (especially toward the end), a stiff jaw, and violent tremors that thankfully didn't wind up becoming permanent. It removed none of the brain fog or the crushing sadness and emptiness, and, in fact, just made my brain more active so it could continue churning out invasive thoughts. Latuda left me the depression and stole the mania.

Lithium thinned my hair out and turned me into a zombie. And being a zombie with a hyperactive brain full of terrible, invasive thoughts is about as disorienting as getting off a speeding merry-go-round blindfolded."
