Cringetopia,fqkz6ax,t3_gj93cr,1589440786.0,This is seconded only to the restaurant owner who did Cher covers.
relationship_advice,fqky9fk,t1_fqkxx3a,1589439933.0,"True. I’m not sure how to hide it. I doubt my roommate would notice, but I think my boyfriend would. To be facing the bedside table, the camera would have to be on my dresser, which only houses a small TV. Maybe I could put a tiny camera in the small space between the bottom of the TV and the top of the dresser?"
relationship_advice,fqkxtjj,t1_fqkxhzd,1589439535.0,I will however be watching the cats after this is all said and done.
relationship_advice,fqkxm06,t1_fqkx7y3,1589439349.0,"I hope it doesn’t come to that, but unfortunately you’re probably right. I’d certainly be less angry if someone was honest with me, but I might have to catch them in the act. Extremely uncomfortable for both parties involved."
relationship_advice,fqkxgcm,t1_fqkx3jk,1589439210.0,"This could work. I have talked about wanting to set up a camera to see what my cats do while I’m gone, haha."
relationship_advice,fqkx1h3,t1_fqkwlah,1589438846.0,"Oh, I definitely agree. I’m not doing anything until I can make an informed decision. I’m just anticipating no one owning up to it and forever questioning both of them. I guess I didn’t phrase that very well in my post, haha. As for my boyfriend, we’re kind of in the middle of repairing trust between the both of us. I don’t want that to create a bias though."
awfuleyebrows,fqkt3lt,t1_fqknl8b,1589435515.0,What about this picture makes this woman seem bitter or divorced? She clearly isn’t middle aged?

Drugs,fkwo3jj,t3_fk6ekg,1584598912.0,"I’m prescribed Gabapentin for anxiety, 800 mg x3 a day. I’ll definitely notice a missed dose. I’ll start to feel increasing nervous, but nothing that would lead up to a panic attack. I don’t really experience any physical withdrawal symptoms. Doesn’t cause me a lot of discomfort."
awfuleyebrows,fjpnflr,t1_fjmuzym,1583555607.0,What would she gain from lying about a pony tail
awfuleyebrows,fjmq60g,t1_fjmnoft,1583479140.0,I believe she explained in a couple interviews that it was so damaged from keeping it red for Victorious/Sam & Cat that she wears it in the same hairstyle with extensions so she can conceal the breakage + let it grow out.
Cringetopia,fiuiw73,t3_f9rkki,1582742252.0,"Goodnight, sweet prince..."
Drugs,f9fct1l,t1_f9fck77,1575266691.0,"I should’ve mentioned it in my original post, but I was going to ween down. It’s more so for anxiety than depression but I take Gabapentin as well and that does most of the leg work. I’ve definitely missed a few doses unintentionally and didn’t enjoy myself. Probably not worth it overall if it’s going to take a month or longer though."

AmItheAsshole,f9amk72,t3_e478bc,1575204239.0,NTA. Your well being is more important than your boyfriend’s gaming session and petty beef with this very kind fellow. Very childish behavior.

Waiters,f48t0hl,t3_djrfoy,1571448060.0,"I’ve seen a few food runners get promoted to wait staff at my restaurant. My advice includes some common sense stuff- make it known you’re interested in serving, work hard, have a good attitude, learn the menu, ask questions. You build a really good foundation as a server by running food. Carrying trays and knowing the menu are the two things I struggled with the most. If you get that down, the rest is cake imo. Do your best and people will notice! Good luck!"

AskReddit,eycjut4,t1_eyc1tjr,1567003003.0,Their reasoning for the first composite sketch being so wildly different from the still taken from one of the girls’s smart phones was that the first sketch was of someone of “secondary interest”.
Instagramreality,eycg706,t1_eycf9qn,1567001445.0,The Getty Images one is the one she had posted on her Instagram. I guess there was nothing to edit around the watermark lmao.
AskReddit,exgw9hq,t3_cse8ud,1566278169.0,Voodoo Vince. My childhood was shaped around this game. My dad and I recently reconnected and he gave me a copy of the game along with an original Xbox to play it on. Cried my eyes out. Would recommend.

bipolar,ewgcd8b,t3_co31tn,1565378707.0,This comic occasionally reappears on my social media from time to time and I’m still absolutely gutted every time I see it. A very accurate visual of what it’s like living with mental illness.
