Haven't played it yet actually, still waiting for a good sale. A lot of people got spoiled on TLOU 2, that will probably affect naughty dog's sales deeply since TLOU is a story focused game. 


I already told you to not give up on reading the books, but I can tell you about my experience with spoilers. In a certain anime, there's a whole arc about saving a guy and I got spoiled that the guy dies at the end. It still was awesome watching it, you can't know every detail, every dialog with just a spoiler. 


In 99% of movies the main character doesn't die, even knowing that we still watch the movies, because they are really entertaining.
