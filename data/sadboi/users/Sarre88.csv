Thank you for opening my eyes to the progress I had no idea I had 😂 I’ve been running a lot so think it’s from my leg muscles getting toned that has helped the cellulite. But definitely nothing I’ve ever really payed attention to. 

Here is a copy paste from the previous comment: I “did it” mainly by IF and OMAD combined with standing at my desk at the office, going for 15 min walks on my breaks and 2-3 times a week running on the treadmill. 
These days I either go for a run outside or do home work outs (not as frequently as I wish I did). And IF...always IF. It’s easier to control my intake on days I don’t feel like working out.  
Side note: I’m a pescatarian and don’t really drink alcohol or carbonated drinks(only on occasions). 
Thanks again for your comment! Really need those today 😁"

Yes my abs peak through in the right angle and lighting 😂 hoping they will shine through at some point 🤞🏽 great job on your weight loss girl! What are the results you are hoping for? I always find it hard to tell what I actually look like when I look in the mirror due to some form of dysmorphia, that’s why I use how clothes fit differently as measurement instead. And all the kind people on Reddit 😄 

I was 120 at my lowest when I was 19, but the number on the scale doesn’t necessarily represent how you look. You also need to take account of your muscles and such. 

My routine was IF/OMAD and running 2-3 times a week on the treadmill. Also I’m a pescatarian.  These days the gym is closed so I run outside. I need it for my sanity during these quarantine times 😂"

It’s easy for me to just not eat, once I do start eating I can’t stop until I feel that overly full feeling.  And since your stomach shrinks with Omad, I get that feeling after just eating a normal portion.  So yes it’s helped me loose a lot of weight! 

But with that said, it has not helped me actually face my issue, I still have days when I binge (but not so frequent) and I guess I just allow myself to binge on that day and try and be kind to myself and say it’s okey. Since on the other days im doing really good and sticking to OMAD. That occasional binge day doesn’t effect me that much."
