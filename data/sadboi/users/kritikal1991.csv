If London goes first then the rest will follow within a few days after. The army will be called upon to patrol the shops and streets to make sure people are not buying more than the stated amount of products or looting.

AskReddit,fkn343t,t1_fkn2psv,1584351260.0,Absolutely that's a great idea. A lot of people are isolated as it is so I can only see this making it a lot worse for mental wellbeing
AskReddit,fkn32m2,t1_fkn2qdk,1584351205.0,I think its the media causing all this panic. I went to buy toilet roll the other day and got stared at with an unaproving look because I have a big family so we buy the big pack. It's out if control. I hope you and yours are well and safe during this time

AskReddit,fkllnku,t1_fkll3ml,1584309293.0,I‚Äôve heard other people say the same thing with citalopram. Like a fog comes over the person. Emotions are a natural thing so to take them away is dangerous in my opinion. I‚Äôm glad you managed to get off them and hope you‚Äôre doing better now

makinghiphop,fkll7hn,t1_fkl9jhr,1584308958.0,Honestly mate you will never look back. You have full control down to the smallest detail over every single frequency within the audio. Plus a DAW like Cubase can actually be linked to FL studio so they can me used at the same time. It‚Äôs incredible what we have at our disposable to produce music right now. Good luck with it brother and if you need any help just holla
AskReddit,fkll041,t1_fklknce,1584308808.0,There‚Äôs definitely something about music that connects with us. I sometimes find though that if I listen to sad music it can make me worse. I guess there is a time and a place for all music üòä

makinghiphop,fkkr830,t3_fittpv,1584290246.0,"I know its absolutely wild that rappers use the actual song to perform ""live"" to. I always use the instrumental version when I perform. My thought is that if people wanted to hear the actual song, they should have stayed at home and streamed it. Live shows should be an experience for sure"
makinghiphop,fkkr1ld,t3_fj1mxs,1584290136.0,"Ahh I remember audacity very well, first program I used too back in 2006. Best thing yo do is move to either FL or another DAW such as Cubase. I'm a bit old school in the fact that I still use Cubase 5! But it never failed me so i never moved from it. Audacity is very limiting and doesn't give you anywhere near as many options when it comes to vocal arrangements and editing. The investment is worth its weight in gold man"
makinghiphop,fkkqsqc,t3_fj37g1,1584289987.0,I've used them a few times and purchased leases. As long as a written contract is in place then I think it's a good thing. Most producers are just trying to earn a living from what they do and as an artist I fully support that üòä
makinghiphop,fkkqlmb,t3_fj2014,1584289868.0,I started rapping in 2006 following the death of my father. I found it was the only way I could Express myself as a young person. Making this music really has saved my life by giving me a platform to share my story through creativity. I always write lyrics based on my own experiences of life. I find it helps to write down as many words as possible that rhyme with each other. This gives me the words to use whenever I want to sit down and write. I'd be more than happy to help anyone out if you have any questions.
