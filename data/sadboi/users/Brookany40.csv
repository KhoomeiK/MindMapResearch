First, I make sure that he doesn't go out too soon before the final time. For us, he goes out around 5pm, and then not again until bedtime, around 10 or 11. My dog is really lazy, and can hold his pee for a loooong time. Obviously, if he indicated that he needed to go out earlier, I would let him, but that hardly ever happens.

Second, if he happens to get up off the couch for any other reason within an hour or so of bedtime, I just let him out then. I take full advantage of that opportunity! 

Third, he gets a bedtime cookie. We have specific treats that he loves, and only gets at bedtime. 

The routine goes as follows: I open the back door and say ""C'mon Ray, time to go peepee!"". He still pauses on the back steps, and turns to look at me, before he commits to it, lol. When he comes back in, he gets the cookie.

This goes smoothly 95% of the time. The only exceptions are if he's not feeling well, or had an unusually active day."

AskReddit,fp5x63s,t1_fp548j5,1588341813.0,"I have multiple pairs of ""house shoes""! Mainly because my feet are always cold, and my dog is a sloppy drinker and I never know when there will be a surprise puddle of water on the floor. Not to mention, I have a cat, and they love to leave disgusting ""land mines"" I'd rather not step in with bare/sock feet."
AskVet,fp51obl,t1_fp498wt,1588313483.0,"Also, the intensity of kitten aggression is NOT an indication of how they will behave as adults. They're going to practice their hunting skills on anything that moves, including you. It can be discouraging (and painful!), but there's no reason to believe she'll be anything like that in a few months. Talk to your vet about spaying her too. That tends to mellow them out a bit."
AskVet,fp40aig,t3_gb3rfs,1588289175.0,"I'm not a vet, but I've had many kittens. This is typical kitten behavior. Don't encourage it. She'll grow out of it eventually. Provide lots of toys to keep her occupied, so she'll bite and scratch you less."
