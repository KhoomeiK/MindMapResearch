non-dump him advice, about the too gentle/too mean communication issues, if he's avoidant, he might be pretending not to understand you when you're gentler, or it might be an inability to pick up on indirect messages with the ASD. either way, clear, direct conversations about the important issues would help you know your message at least got across. i'm not super familiar w specific dbt skills but i feel like some of those are geared to help you express your boundaries and needs well, right? maybe you can use some of those?

it makes sense for you to need more time with that, as well as a lot of practice, and living separately probably helps you with that more than being on top of each other and being triggered by her reaction and probably set back in your progress any time you make a mistake. your mom might be so entrenched in this pattern that she won't change unless the situation changes for her.

just a thought, tho i may be off base - so do most of these just have a basis of the guy thinking ur pretty, and u say yes just bc he asked? there may just not be any personal connection for you to work with. like, neither of u would know anything about each other to realize u wouldn't get along before u commit to it and then get rejected, which sucks and hurts. it may just be a bad population to sample from, so to speak; just personally, guys who ask me out based on looks tend to be .. not for me.

practice is important, like even if you found ur person/ur people u'd still be awkward at first while u got used to them, but trying to overcome ur bullying background and the avpd with these guys might be too hard n discouraging

acknowledge it neutrally and let it pass without judgement. maybe find something to comment to yourself about her that isn't about her body and make that a new habit.

be nice and generous to yourself about it as you work on this, which will also be a part of changing your self-esteem!  the same way that taking a second to acknowledge that the woman in front of you (even on a screen) has something to her other than her ""league"" will make it easier to internalize that about yourself and vice versa."
asktransmen,fcvmmvg,t3_ej3z6n,1578005367.0,"2. she's joking, but consider [indya moore](https://twitter.com/IndyaMoore/status/1097279158659571712)'s tweets from last year and the difficulty in trying to narrow down what exactly you refer to when you say ""biological \[gender\]"". might as well say it applies to your actual gender and not your assigned one!

these do seem elementary, you could probably find a lot of existing information and discussion by basic googling."
AvPD,fcugbgs,t3_eis2yd,1577980277.0,"mediocre company would be one thing but this sounds like harmful company which isnt good for you, obviously. but if it's going to end the friendship anyways, would you be willing to try to talk about how her behavior makes you feel with her once? could be good practice for you"
AvPD,fcufp7z,t3_eiuwyx,1577979849.0,"yeah, most of the time. used to have a whole closet of aspirational clothes i never left the house in. even as i get into men's clothes i found out i'm afraid to wear anything that's not oversized because i don't have to confidence to ... look good in public?? lol"

AvPD,fcrm782,t3_eic2e2,1577903636.0,happy new year to you! i hope this year brings you at least a little improvement! i'll be working towards the same

AvPD,fclal7n,t3_ehsc4s,1577743413.0,"great job!! and it sounds super doable, nice for you :D"
AvPD,fckteil,t3_eha8l1,1577732788.0,oh god the same thing happened to me and i'm only just starting to come back out of it after a few years. there's an agoraphobia sub and an associated discord server that helped me figure out some things to do. they're very nice.
AvPD,fckm0ji,t3_ehmxxx,1577728245.0,"this isn't related to your post but you sound like a really fun person!

did you get the diagnosis from your therapist and/or are they aware of it? that'd be a good place to go talk about why they think it's a good fit for you or not. but it sounds like the positive changes are recent and significant, and maybe the diagnosis would have made more sense to you at the beginning of your life, before you starting making improvements. i don't think that means you can't get any benefit out of it now, if only to help you make sense of why you were like that if you need to process that.

and as you can tell there's a fair bit of overlap between PDs! so i'm not really sure that getting an exact diagnosis is as important as figuring out the ballpark of where you're at and what will help you"
DowntonAbbey,fckkh1l,t3_ehnmxw,1577727293.0,"matthew was the major draw for me and the last three seasons were an absolute drag to get through even though i still liked the other characters, so i'd say no."
AvPD,fckk9o4,t3_ehnplq,1577727166.0,"yeah!! it used to be so bad and eventually i fucking hated being asked to repeat myself so many times. i just could not go any louder than i already was. working in a kitchen for a bit forced me to learn how to shout and trying to do my own ftm voice training is helping me access my chest voice but i still have problems. especially if i'm in public around strangers i feel like i'm disturbing them so i automatically go quiet and it's physically hard to get past that.

the irony is i also have trouble processing what people are saying so i irritate them right back, and the combo doesn't really make me want to strike up conversations with people lol."
AvPD,fcghod7,t3_eh599f,1577640157.0,"yes, you're so extremely young, there is so much possibility and capability ahead of you, and a relationship/a girl isn't the secret key everyone else has that'll complete your life."
bigender,fcggpes,t3_eh74cu,1577639759.0,"oh no! ): at a guess i would think there might be some kind of internalized transphobia that the girl side feels like an outlet for. i do notice that when i'm feeling more my assigned gender and less dysphoria it's easy to slip into thinking things like 'why can't people with heavy dysphoria just put up with it?' because i forget what it feels like. it feels like i have goldfish memory in a goofy but also jerky way.

but i like what you talk about in your first paragraph of trying on both realities and seeing that they're not in conflict - maybe this is just part of that, like with more practice you'll see in the same way that your current identity doesn't have to be in conflict with someone else's, they're just different and both real.

also maybe simplistic, but i'd honestly follow the same advice cis people get when they first have to change how they think of someone and are making mistakes - don't get hung up on it when it happens, because it just happens sometimes, and assigning too much intention or meaning to it just accidentally reinforces it in your mind; just let it pass and gently correct yourself and move on and hopefully it'll start coming up less. sorry it's happening, tho ):"
