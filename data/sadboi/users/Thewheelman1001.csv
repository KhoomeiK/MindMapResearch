SquaredCircle,fr0wxbs,t3_glyfxe,1589808638.0,The Undisputed Era are so damn good. They are the perfect mix of amazing wrestling and good wrestling comedy. Perfect for Vince to completely ruin by moving them to Raw or Smackdown.
animaltalking,fr0ujic,t3_glrujk,1589807075.0,It's such a good composition...

SquaredCircle,fp3km6c,t1_fp3iu52,1588280958.0,"It's possible she does go back, but my guess is she goes to AEW. She's already talked about it, and Britt Baker is her best friend."
SquaredCircle,fp3g80g,t3_gaykbq,1588278758.0,"She's definitely a byproduct of WWE just bloating their roster because they can afford to keep talent away from AEW. She's talented, good in the ring, and clearly has ideas for her future. WWE will always have stupid decision making in who they choose to push, and there's only so many spots for that....especially in the NXT women's division. If nobody in the Performance Center believed in her for some reason or another, she just won't get a spot. I think she's probably a lock for AEW, and I hope she kills it!"
Browns,foy826t,t3_g9ta1g,1588167405.0,This is so awesome! I might have to get a Higgins jersey! It's just absolutely maddening how Freddie didn't use him last year when he was available.

Trivium,foqf018,t1_fopzj67,1587991980.0,"I honestly think Alex is sticking around. Everything I've heard from Matt, and how happy he seems with how these last two records turned out...and him and Alex are both streamers and seem like they're pretty good friends. Apparently their manager was the one who recommended him to Matt. It just seems like these last two records are how they want to sound going forward, and everything seems to point towards keeping Alex Bent. Not to mention the outcry the fans would have if they let him go after these last two albums hahaha"

Cuz he's an octopus....

I'll see myself out Haha"

magicTCG,fo6jg12,t3_g604eq,1587560324.0,"This is what I've been wondering for awhile. What's this incredibly advanced game like for a brand new person. Literally everything has a complex ability and interacts with each other. I'm not new by any stretch, and I know what everything does and how to play, but I'm not great by any stretch of the word. I can't imagine how tough it must be for a new person!"
Trivium,fnoskwg,t3_g2eo6k,1587132770.0,Something that I just realized this morning listing to them. Heafy is only 34 YEARS OLD. It's quite possible he's just entered his vocal prime.

I could barely get through the first round of the free workout...and I had to really adjust the pullups because of my lack of pullup bar. Pretty sure my goal for the first few weeks of this is to actually get through the second round hahaha"
