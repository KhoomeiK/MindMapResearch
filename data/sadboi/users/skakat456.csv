progressive_islam,foivz64,t3_g73svx,1587798864.0,"I definitely think it can be traced to those two factors. As far as economic situations are concerned, you will find that the freedom women enjoy in society is significantly related to the financial condition of the society. At the current time, the countries that are richer give more rights and privileges to woman than countries that are not and over the course of history as a country becomes more richer it provides more rights to its women.

As far as, Islam being a young religion is concerned. Although it is true that islam is young it is still fairly old. It is almost a millennium and a half old. One thing I notice is as a religion becomes older diverse interpretions become more established in it."

Trying to be an orthodox muslim as a gay person is like being a fish out of water or like a bird having wings but choosing to walk on land.

If you do however choose to be single all your life, you could look to James Randi as an example. He was this person in the 70s and 80s I think who used to go around debunking miracles. He had a very successful career and remained single. Later on it turns out he was also homosexual."

progressive_islam,fmfl8u9,t3_fu7bxn,1586029596.0,"I don't really get this culture of following a ""sheikh"". It would be better in my opinion if you didn't follow any one ""sheikh"" like a father and instead acquired your teachings from multiple sources.

I do not really find either NAK or OS interesting enough. They are basically the same as the orthodox types. They are just softer and kinder.

I did take an interest in NAK a while back because he was being hailed for being able to explain the miraculousness of the quran. And honestly I found some of the stuff interesting but I was not convinced of his assertions of the miraculousness. Infact, sometimes I found it very ridiculous. There's a video on yt where he talks about a verse in the quran that says ""And declare the greatness only of your lord"" which is a palindrome in arabic. Then he challanges people to say ""declare the greatness only of your lord"" in any other language such that it is a palindrome. That is akin to me asking NAK if he can say ""racecar"" in arabic such that it is a palindrome and then claiming that to be some sort of miraculous achievement."

In todays world do people living in istanbul really need to see someone's hand chopped off in the square? Do people in dubai really need to see someone get stoned in a public area?

I would say no. Let the punishment be carried out in a jail or prison people do not need to see it, and let the punishment fit the crime. I do not want someone's hand to be cut off for petty theft. Or see someone get stoned for having sex in privacy even if it was outside of marriage."
progressive_islam,fmczsk2,t3_fu81y9,1585956214.0,"I guess I am in the same boat. I grew up in a traditional indian muslim household. Growing up I actually became very religious at one point and then that religiosity slowly decreased as I started to object to more and more things in islam.

I went through an intense period too of questioning my identity and what religion meant to me. I still haven't solved my identity issue but I am doing much better today.

Honestly, I believe that I am just being myself. And myself is not a bad person. I don't want to harm anyone I don't want to pull muslims out of the mosque or make them less religious I just want to be me. I do not have much to do with the mosque community since I do not go there a lot. I do not enjoy being there the environment is stifling- filled with orthodox elders who will say the same stuff I have objections too. I just honestly take from religion what is beneficial. Like fasting and giving in charity and good teachings."

exmuslim,ff5dok8,t1_ff5d4mn,1579588537.0,"As far as the history of hijab goes. I think islam did have the good interest for women at its heart but in its own time. In our times these traditions seem as if they are holding women back.

In traditional society pretty much every where. Women did not have a great role in society and there's many reasons for that. Making the patriarchy the sole reason for this is not a good enough explanation. In much of history there was no form of birth control this put women in a very vulnerable situation by itself. The traditional woman could not live a very sexually luxurious life because of fear of pregnancy. Also life was in general much harder then. We forget how much technology and medicine has changed our lives. Life expectancy was so low that getting married early was reasonable.

So keeping these things in mind I don't think islam was inherently oppressive to women. I think it just tried to do the best it could with what was available. I think the problem is stubborn, arrogant, orthodox people in our times, who do not understand that times have changed and many things that were sensible to do then hold no sense in being done today."
exmuslim,ff5d4mn,t3_e57fgu,1579587931.0,"Without going into the topic of internal misogyny, because that would be a huge discussion in its own right, the only practical way to approach this issue is to let women freely choose what they want. If a woman wants to wear it let her wear it and if a woman does not want to wear it then she should not be forced into wearing it. If a woman who wants to wear it is forcefully stopped from wearing it then that is oppression and if a woman does not want to wear but is forced to wear it then that is oppression. I don't know if there are many countries that have criminalized hijab and there are a few countries that have mandated it. I believe this should change and is sad."

I encourage you to not feel low or less about yourself. I myself suffer with social anxiety disorder. And little by little I have made some progress. Mastering social skills is not an easy thing to do, let alone connecting with people on a deep level. But it's all doable. A lot of people in the world do it. Your ancestors were able to do it too. I encourage you to search for resources on how to become more sociable. Books, videos, therapy, counseling, people etc.

I at the moment take ssri, meet a counselor weekly and read this book called ""Overcoming Social Anxiety: A step by step guide"" to try and solve my problem. Along with that I try to socialize as much as I can. I always try to be a part of groups no matter how hard, nerve-wrecking or awkward it is."
