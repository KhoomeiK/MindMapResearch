GenderCritical,fqptrex,t3_gjtvtv,1589553823.0,"> And I think some of this mindset is also poisoning our arguments regarding TIMs because it's common for a woman to say that a man can't be a woman because he hasn't suffered like we have, and to me that's one of our weaker arguments.

>To be born female today entails suffering and sacrifice, no doubt, but when we equate being female with suffering, aren't we actually upholding the idea that it's normal and natural for women and girls to suffer and deny themselves pleasure?

I loved everything you wrote except for this last sentiment. I think it is one of our strongest arguments.

Here's why: 
It's not that he hasn't suffered or denied himself pleasure. It is that he hasn't grown up with this suffering engrained into him, and he had never thought of eschewing pleasure as normal. That is an experience that he can never understand or relate to.I don't equate being female to suffering, but that is the reality that we are born into. It is strange to me that they think dressing up makes them a woman. It's a mask of womanhood."

>I think the idea that transmen don't pass must be because the ones who do pass, pass so well that they don't need to be out as trans. They just go about living their lives.

There is a word for that in their terminology. I can't remember the word rn, buts it's something like silently passing.. Anyway, I watched a shitshow go down in their subs about a year ago where TIM's and TIFs (but mostly TIM's) proved themselves to be disgustingly entitled and jealous assholes by demanding that the people who pass without ever being questioned/naturally had the feminine or masculine features that they aspire to, to come out and reveal themselves as trans. They list various bullshit reasons on why these people should have to ""come out"" like trans visibility or how they aren't representing an accurate or legitimate trans experience. It was mind boggling. I think it all may have started with an AITA post about a TIM outing another TIM to people who were unaware and thought she was a natural born female. Funnily enough (since this was being discussed above) they were both TIM lesbians who were dating each other. One was 2 years further that the other on hormone therapy and make up skills, and the other was incredibly jealous and bitter.

The word they use to describe perfectly passing / silently passing escapes me now. I'll post it when I remember it."

I see that you have taken some pictures here. Your pictures remind me of what I refer to as my trips to Church. I love the forests. I think the PNW is the most beautiful place in the world. I'm a transplant from Florida and when I first moved, I was pulling over to take pics of Mount Rainier from all over and I couldn't get over the the fact that I will get to see this everyday. I still think people born here are unappreciative of the scenary here, but I suppose I am numb to sandy tropical beaches. Spring is so beautiful here. My favorite time of year. The cherry blossoms are blooming, it's the perfect temperature, and sunny. Although, I do love the rain and the gloomy days too. I think I was traumatized by the blinding sun and searing wet heat that is South Florida. I appreciate the clouds. There is only one thing I miss about Florida and it's the thunderstorms. 

Okay, I'll stop gushing about the PNW and get on to your username. In Maleficent (the first one), Maleficent is a child and she meets a boy who is future King Stephan- (Aurora aka sleeping beauty's dad.)- because one of the other fairies tell her that ""a boy is stealing gems from the fairy lake."" I am 99% sure that's the exact quote. My daughter found this movie late, but she is obsessed with it and we watch it at least once a day right now. Qurantine times. Lol.
