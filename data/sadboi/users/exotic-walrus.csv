first of all I'd like to say that I'm one of the people who doesn't really want to get better, I don't have any idea who I would be if I didn't have these mental health issues
I would recommend talking to a professional about this, I'm going to meet with my counselor soon and that's one of the things I want to talk about
so if you have someone's to talk to (e.g. a therapist) I think that's what you should do"
