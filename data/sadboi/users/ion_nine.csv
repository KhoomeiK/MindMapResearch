You are right. He will never totally understand. I think the best approach to this is understanding the misconceptions and how and why they’re misconceptions.

People believe bipolar phases are ‘a little more extreme’ than normal emotions, though I, along with many with bipolar (at least after a bit of time getting to know the disorder) will tell you that hypo/mania is a distinct emotional and cognitive state than being happy or excited, and depression is a unique state from sadness.

I can tell pretty easily when I’m cycling. There’s really no question in my head if I’m merely having a good day, or if I’m hypomanic.

I think that’s the biggest misconception that people have-that it’s an extension to what they can appreciate and understand.

[eta: the following is intended as conjecture and based on my own personal observations and may be controversial]

Also, normies are an odd lot. They desperately want to stand out and be unique, but they fear - above almost everything else - being seen as deviant.

For people with a serious MI the ongoing sense that we don’t necessarily experience the world the same way breaks down this construct, and over time it becomes evident that we cannot trust that our perceptions will necessarily align with a norm.

We generally learn to accept our neurodiversity and depart from this pre-occupation, though this takes years of radical acceptance. So being told ‘oh, we’re all a little bit bipolar’ can be a real slap in the face.

But With this in mind comments like these make total sense. He was trying to tell you ‘you’re different, but not deviant’. It’s a normie complement, in a weird way, trying to help you feel ‘normie’ because not being normie to him is a pretty scary thought (think of the kind of terminology AA uses). For you you coming to terms with your diverse neurology , it’s probably it may have come across as marginalizing and hurtful.

But that’s really not what he intended."

All it would take is one false in  any number of things that we think we know for the rest to become false.”

This is eerily similar to arguments that I make literally all the time - in fact your wording here is oddly ‘glitch in the matrix’ even!

However, in general I use this line of thought to argue the notion we rely on faith and probability in what we know is true is truth. Indeed, we do have good evidence that modulating certain neurotransmitters using drugs does affect what we call ‘psychosis’.

So I think that the probability of this observation as actual is likely. Ofcourse there is some degree of faith I’m placing on the observation being accurate - but I put that kind of faith on literally all my observations no matter how mundane. So that’s kind of beside the point.

Even so, the statement that schizophrenia is a result of diversity of neurochemical balance (neurodiversity) says nothing about what psychosis fundamentally is, nor from where what we call ‘hallucination’, ‘delusions’ or ‘distortions’ actually come from.

If we are willing to accept all perception is a neurochemical process, then there is no reason to assume that psychosis is likewise a form of perception.

In some ways ‘chemical imbalance’ could be seen as a myth in as far that ‘imbalance’ places a value judgement on neurodiversity. However, it’s absolutely evident that neurodiversity and neurochemistry is a thing."

We also know that people with mental health issues are more likely to use drugs, including cannabis, which is readily available and socially accepted in many parts of the world - specifically so in Europe where this study took place.

This becomes a sort of occram’s razor: is it more likely that cannabis inexplicably causes mental illness, or is it more likely that people with mental illness use cannabis at a younger age? Is it more likely that more potent cannabis causes psychosis, or is it more likely that people with mental illnesses seek out more potent marijuana? 

Is it more likely that, through some unknown mechanism, for some unknown reason, some very small population of, but not all - or even most, marijuana users will eventually go on to develop psychosis, or that a small portion of marijuana users already have a mental illness?

Psychosis isn’t like how you see in the movies. It’s not like you’d be going along just fine and then one day you snap. In the case of schizophrenia layers of more subtle negative symptoms pre-exist, usually undiagnosed. Bipolar patients usually go years without being diagnosed before it progresses into a first psychotic manic episode. This misconception gives way to the plausibility that otherwise healthy cannabis users would go on to develop psychosis out of the blue. In reality, psychosis doesn’t just emerge from nothing.

Unless there is clear epidemiological or physiological evidence concluding that cannabis causes psychosis the conclusion that this correlative prediction is causal just does not follow.

This is yet another correlative study. Simply because the researchers chose to conclude a causal interpretation does not indicate that fact.

ETA- and if you want to take a trip down the physiological rabbit hole, I’d implore you to research cannabis’ influence on dopaminergics. It’s a profoundly complex  and fascinating topic that is often contradictory and paradoxical.

There is nothing about psychosis that would dumb-down reasoning. All that psychosis does is alter your perception of the world.

For me, psychosis is about ‘knowledge’ and anxiety is about ‘fear’. I’m anxious about loosing my job, and I know the whispering I hear from the other room is my boss and lead talking about my performance. But this doesn’t mean that I can’t rationalize that there’s no way I could hear low whispers from another office, and theirfor the voices I’m hearing must be psychosis.

Severe psychosis is indistinct from every day life and therefor lack any rational cues that they aren’t real. So imagine if your knowing that evil spirits are haunting you is as plain and ordinarly visceral as anything else you understand as fact, you can appreciate how some people with severe psychosis and delusions would come to accept these delusions as truth.

But no, ‘believing’ your delusions does not make them not delusional. However, sensing a presence also does not make you psychotic. Only a doctor can diagnose a psychotic disorder, though in my experience the difference is  in whether you ‘know’ something versus vaguely sense or fear it.

Also in my experience these events occur in a weird dream-like state. It’s hard to explain, but I sort of drift off of reality. Sometimes it’s kind of momentary, but in severe psychosis it’ll last days or weeks with my memory and time perception being grossly impacted. This may not be what others experience.

The problem with your assertion is that of ‘suffering’ and ‘feeling pain’. If we look at mammalian brains then, sure, the correlation can be established and it’s safe to assume that these organisms feel pain in a way that is, at least neurologically similar, to our own.

But can we say the same about mollusks? Maybe. What about jellyfish and coral? These organisms are about as neurologically diverse from our own as it could possibly get while still being animals.

Again, the problem here are words like ‘pain’ and ‘suffering’ ... these are not scientifically measurable. What is measurable is neurological response and behavior. But that’s it. We can assume with a high degree of confidence that all humans experience pain similarly - but that is an assumption. When we get into other life forms, that confidence diminishes rapidly as we depart from similar neurology.

And what exactly does a clams neurological pain response look like exactly, and how do you correlate that neurology to suffering? Ask it to rate the pain on a scale from ‘happy’ to ‘captain’s special’?

If an organism avoids a stimulus, it clear that the organism ‘suffers’ in the most basic sense.

We are only barely starting to understanding complex fungal life, and if you actually look into the subject it’s not nearly clear-cut as you might think.

As I’ve said, some fungi are capable of learning about a negative stimulus, avoid the stimulus in the future and pass on this information not only to its present colony, but to other colonies as well.

It seems odd to me you’d conclude that this is any different than animal life avoiding danger, such as human predation. The sensation we associate with ‘suffering’ is the motivational feedback to avoid danger in our environment. 

But whether or not an animal feels ‘suffering’ similar to how we do is arbitrary, dubious and ultimately unscientific. It’s also wholly unnecessary in making a moral judgement.

If you cannot file, you should contest your ability to file as an individual with the irs."

If you get your medicine in a stereotypical amber or greenish pharmacy bottle, and not in a bottle that usually bears the drug’s logo, manufacturer with (usually) the inserts attached, typically in an opaque white plastic, sometimes squarish container there is no way of knowing which lot number unless it’s somewhere on the bottle the pharmacy provided."
afinil,fe518rv,t1_fe3nn0r,1578864718.0,"Racetams (which noopept isn’t, by the way) have a lengthy history as adjuncts in the recreational psychedelic and stimulant use. It is plausible that these reports are placebo, but given that many experienced users report such a significant effect it seems unlikely. 

In fact this is how I was first exposed to racetams long ago, and I do believe noopept does synergize with caffeine. So I think there are immediate effects, and simply because there is lacking research does not mean that the effect doesn’t exist or that we can discredit the experiences of others as placebo, only that there’s no reason to expect that effect in others.

Whether any of this translates to better test scores, I don’t really know. 

Part of me kind of wonders if nootropics elicit the sensation of ‘intellectual confidence’ without actually affecting the ability to recall, store and integrate information, perhaps similar to how cannabis and classical psychedelics elicit the sensation of enlightenment without actually making any tangible conclusions - that sensation of understanding the universe but only to ‘forget’ the moment the user attempts to explain it. 

This might actually be why racetams are common adjuncts in the first place.

The feeling of understanding is very rewarding and specific, and the sensation I’d argue might even be interoceptive. Certainly there must be some neurological pathway for this universally acknowledged experience."

However I replaced it with caffeine since adrafinal caused a ‘spun’ or ‘strung out’ kind of mental fatigue feeling after several days. 

My stack includes a number of stimulant racetams as we as noopept, however, and in my case the synergy with caffeine is pronounced, and feels like a low to medium dose of amphetamine."

Sure there’s room for improvement in VA Benefits, but come on.

Expecting freebies is the definition of entitlement. I think it’s great people offer active duty discounts and benefits, but if you expect them then yes, it’s entitlement."

But I don’t think people with kids think like that, and more just see family expenses as a whole.

The thing about insurance also is that you have to be making a fair amount before you’re disqualified completely from assistance of any kind. Not a lot, mind you, but for the typical single-income household chances are there will be either Medicaid, chip or advanced premium credits.

Granted, someone is still paying, but when we’re talking about out of pocket expenses a lot of lower and middle income households have their children’s insurance covered to some degree."

When you see a dirty homeless person, it’s not because they don’t have access - frequently they do - it’s because they’re often so mentally ill or addicted they’ve lost the ability to care for themselves.

Getting a gym membership isn’t terrible advise, and very well could be your best option. but hygiene services are also often available at no charge, especially if you’re already in an employment or drug rehab program. Access to showers and laundry is seldom the issue."

Please. Get some common sense and perspective over what a typical working and middle class household looks like before spouting off this nonsense. 

It’s either that or you have a very long loan on a 2004 Toyota and live in a very inexpensive location."

In other words, the police shouldn’t have the right to prosecute a clergy for accessory after the fact - we all can agree on that - but we’re the civil rights of the partitioner violated when the clergy reports a crime if they choose to do so.
