toastme,fnhxqie,t3_g1sw4a,1586970606.0,"I understand how you feel with procrastination and being in a toxic friendship. I was in one for about 4 or 5 years and just now have I started to move away from the toxicity. Just remember that you need to put your health first since that is all you can control. As for the procrastination and not feeling like you have a purpose, I believe that you will have some sort of future, and this schoolwork you see before you is only temporary. I know it sucks, and I know it is easy to listen to music or watch YouTube all day, but you will feel much better once you start to get the schoolwork done. And if you really can't find any motivation, let someone know. You aren't hurting anyone when you tell them how you feel. If you don't feel comfortable telling family, maybe email a teacher. Just remember that there are people out there that feel the same as you, so you don't have to fight this alone. Take it from someone who has been and is still sort of in a similar situation as you are. Good luck with what you do, and keep on pushing through all of this. It is a tough time for us all, so I wish you the best of luck (:

Sincerely,

u/aviationwar"
