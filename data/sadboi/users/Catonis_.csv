Grimdawn,fo40z88,t1_fo40awy,1587496330.0,"So armor is important, but resitances are more so. I don't know your level of understanding of game mechanics but basically every time you take damage the game rolls and decides which part is hit, then you have a base % for armor absorption that you can also modify. So if I have to order your defensive priorities I would say resistances, then raise your armor absorption and armor concurrently if possible. Keep in mind as well that due to the way the math is done for damage resitances have a greater effect on the final value as resistance % is subtracted before absorption and armor rating are calculated"
Grimdawn,fo3zfly,t1_fo3yrow,1587495570.0,"Respeccing might help a bit, but what would probably help more would just be better armor, you're over 50 so you should start seeing legendary drops soon if you havent already. Once you start changing out those Magic/rare items for legendaries I'm sure you'll see a significant stat change"
Grimdawn,fo3wzl7,t3_g5kni4,1587494366.0,"From what I've experienced glass cannon builds really arent viable in NG+/higher difficulty Grim Dawn. As you can see in your first picture you have a few resistances that are in the negative and in Grim Dawn resistances are everything. Just make sure to get your resitances in the positive at least and you'll be much better off for it, prioritize defense over offense, then when you're able to takes hits and survive focus on your damage"

Without feeling like you're being overbearing, it's important to be patient and let him come to you when he's ready, but it's just as important you clearly express to him that the door is open."
relationship_advice,fn02ipd,t3_fyi2rb,1586534261.0,"I think perhaps you were beating around the bush a little too much from how you said you approached the topic.
