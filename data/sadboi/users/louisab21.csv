I created different contexts Home, Work, Priorities and In-Process.  

I load up the home and work contexts with whatever tasks pop up that I need or want to do.  

Once a week I move the most important items in Work and Home to Priorities.  (You can drag and drop them)  And I add new tasks to Priorities everyday as they come up.  

Then every evening I move the tasks that I have to do and commit to do the next day from Priorities to In-process.  I keep my In-Process task list to between 8-10 items a mix of quick tasks (like walking the dog)  and longer tasks (like creating a work presentation, or attending a work meeting).  I’ll even put washing my hair on there.  

The next morning that in-process list is my compass . When I’m twirling aimlessly around the house I challenge myself to look at the list and do what I’m supposed to do.  Very rarely do I finish all ten items, but seeing the check marks makes me feel good that I did more than I otherwise would have.

My suggestion is to reassure her as much as possible that you love her.  

Educate yourself and read as much as possible about anxiety and depression. 

Model the right behavior by making  an appointment with a therapist for yourself for counseling on how to be a good partner to her.  Ask her to go too so you can work on your relationship together but if she doesn’t go then go alone.
