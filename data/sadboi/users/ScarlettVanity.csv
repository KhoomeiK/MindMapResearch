AskDocs,fqz6fpj,t3_glm5on,1589760857.0,"Hi friend! I’m not a doctor but I have diagnosed celiac disease. Your symptoms sound really similar to what mine were when I was undiagnosed. As others are saying definitely go back to your GP and get a blood test, maybe ask to see a different doctor? Also when I cut gluten out of my diet it took me a few months for symptoms to fully go away to bear that in mind also. Good luck with everything!! I know it sucks but hang in there!"

TwoXSex,foswkdz,t3_g91h0s,1588039543.0,"I would honestly just tell him exactly what you have written (If you haven’t already)
I would ask him as well why he wanted to see you touch yourself, as you said it’s probably just because he thinks it’d be hot but in my experience most of the time with dudes they just want you to enjoy yourself and have a good time whatever that means for you. So if that’s using toys or whatever helps you to get off I’m sure he’d enjoy it. 

I also think it’s common like as women to feel self conscious about how we look during orgasm or during sex in general I also hyper analyse everything about myself and I’m sure other people do too. 

Just wanted you to know you’re definitely not alone! 💓"

SkincareAddiction,fmxirgb,t3_fxzydt,1586465759.0,"Product details: 

Skin type: combination 
Skin goals: to be glowy, to reduce breakouts. 

Glossier milky jelly cleanser: I just got this and the other glossier products in the post today so don’t have much to say! It’s very gentle and has a super faint rose smell. 

Glossier solution: again not too much to say I was previously using the pixi glow tonic but decided to switch it up. 

The ordinary salicylic acid solution: use this under my toner to help minimise breakouts. 

Glossier priming moisturiser: has made my skin feel really soft, kind of has a faint sunscreen smell to me. 

Elf cosmetics illuminating eye cream: this is my second post of this! I really enjoy this eye cream it’s super fast absorbing and a really nice base for makeup. 

Lush full of grace serum bar: I use this underneath face masks but you could use it as a moisturiser if you wanted extra hydration! 

Lush ultrabland cleanser: I use this to take off my makeup and I’m absolutely obsessed with it, it takes EVERYTHING off."

PanPorn,fliintm,t1_flhniyy,1585183348.0,"Hi friend! Even though this has already been answered by someone else I honestly didn’t notice too much difference. I really like using an eye cream as part of my routine even if it does nothing much 😅 you could probably get the same effect from a regular moisturiser but as far as this one goes I find it to be really soothing, lightweight and it absorbs in very quickly :) I’ve already repurchased my second tub. But as with everything it’s entirely personal preference."

We’ve decided that we’re going to have our own little Christmas celebration together just us, he says he’s going to cook so I’m really looking forward to that 🥰

ProjectPan,fbetysq,t3_ed0cj7,1576793880.0,"Product list: 

-Jaclyn hill eyeshadow palette: I love this palette would love to hit pan in some shades. 

-elf poreless putty primer: this primer is okay but I have super oily skin and this doesn’t work amazingly for me. 

-elf plumping gloss in the shade champagne glam: I love this gloss! It’s a super pretty shimmery champagne colour! It’s already about half used.

-colourpop no filter concealer shade fair 02: this concealer is on its last legs so I’d love to get it all used up! 

-milk flex concealer in porcelain: this concealer is really nice, super high coverage yet lightweight, really great at highlighting too, but it’s expensive and I find you don’t actually get that much product. 

-colourpop eyeshadow in glass bull: I love unique eyeshadows and this is one of my favourites! 

-nabla water dream: this is a new shadow to my collection but it’s so beautiful. 

-sugarpill trinket: again a super beautiful glittery liquid lipstick, this doesn’t get as much love as it deserves. 

-stila liquid shadow in kitten karma: ABSOLUTELY STUNNING shadow. It makes for such a quick glam look. 

-ABH modern renaissance: I know this is a cult favourite but I honestly am not a huge fan of these shades, I don’t reach for it too often but I’m hoping to get some love out of the reddish shades. 

-elf blush in twinkle pink: super pretty blush one of my favourites, super buildable! 

-elf matte for matte in summer breeze: this palette is lovely, great quality for the price, I use the dark brown shade for my brows everyday so I’m hoping to hit pan. 

-benefit porefesional primer: only a smidge left in here so hoping to use it up! 

-colourpop no filter foundation stick: this foundation is okay, hoping to rotate it. 


Colourpop super shock shadows in shades from L-R: 
-ice dream

-weenie

I’ve worked for lush for about a year now and honestly product knowledge didn’t factor in for me at all in terms of getting hired, nor has it for any of our new starters. You learn everything you need as you work. I’m not sure what will go into the interview but it’ll most likely be games, maybe making bath bombs stuff like that. Overall if you’re the right fit they’ll see that straight away. My passion for the company and the products was one of the main things that got me hired and if you’re on this sub I’d say that’s a pretty good indication of passion! Good Luck!
