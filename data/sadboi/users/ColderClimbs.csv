PinkpillFeminism,fpsfoxr,t3_gexbjf,1588872689.0,"What brought me to feminism was learning that most of my religions scriptures have been misinterpreted over the years. Taken out of content, twisted and/or mistranslated. 

I believe personally that men are held to a high standard in my religion (at least According to scripture) as well as the women. But as times gone on more men don’t take pride in doing what’s right in the church they teach their boys not to care, (I can’t speak for the distant past but that’s what I’ve seen in my life time). 

I don’t judge but at the same time I feel it’s right to speak the injustice women have endured. The Bible even has scripture where they say to not associate and be wary of people who has caused you harm in the past. I also believe my God has no gender, is repulsed by the injustice we have to endure. The scriptures say singleness is a gift. I believe Gods given many of us the opportunity to have that gift. 

I’ve run into a lot of unmarried women and girls in my church and others religions who believe the same. Even if we don’t agree on everything, we can find common ground. Which has been very comforting.

That’s my story with religion and I really appreciate reading all your perspectives as well."
