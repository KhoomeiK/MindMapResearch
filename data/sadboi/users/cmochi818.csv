I‚Äôve been feeling the hyperthyroid symptoms for a few years but around 6 months ago things started getting a lot worse (losing 20 pounds rapidly, a very noticeable tremor, waking up sweating) but I chalked it up to my antidepressants. I had an appt with my MD two weeks weeks ago and she told me it did not sound like my antidepressants were causing these symptoms at all but I was displaying classic signs of hyperthyroidism. She sent me to the labs for blood work and my readings came back abnormal (high t4, but normal TSH??) and she could not figure out why. She put me on on a beta blocker for now (propranolol) to control my heart rate. She knows my family history of autoimmune disorders and asked me to see my dads endocrinologist, as he might have better knowledge on how to treat me since he has been treating my dad. I saw the endo on Tuesday and he too could not explain the abnormal readings, but based on symptoms and family history deduced it is hyperthyroidism but he doesn‚Äôt know why. He sent me to the lab for more thyroid function tests (free T4, TSH ultra sensitive, TSI, and t3) and I am waiting to hear on them. He says he will most likely start me on Tapezole, but that it might not work long term and I may have to do the radioactive iodine treatment. For now we‚Äôre just waiting on the lab results. It‚Äôs been a wild two weeks.

I miss going to school and actually seeing my classmates and professors. I miss just calling my friends and cousins and asking if they wanted to run errands together. Impromptu visits from family. Seeing my boyfriend‚Äôs family. I miss my extended family so much. This is the longest time we have gone without all seeing each other. We have a large family group chat and FaceTime, but it just isn‚Äôt the same. 

Most of all, I miss my preschool babies. I work in childcare/preschool and had the realization that I would never see a lot of my kids again, because they will be heading off to kindergarten by the time we might be coming back to work. I truly love my job and it brought so much joy to my life to be around these tiny people and teaching them how to navigate the world. The fact that I never really got to say goodbye to the older ones going to grade school breaks my heart. I hope they remember me."
