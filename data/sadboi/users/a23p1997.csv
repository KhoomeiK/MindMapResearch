You guys should be motherfucking embarrassed. Idk what the fuck it is. This team basically changed top to bottom from 10 years ago, yet the mentality is the same. At least I get to watch the Raptors tonight. What a blessing.  I don't give a fuck if they lose. I know they'll give it their all even if they're shooting 2/69 from three."
