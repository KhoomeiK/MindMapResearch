O.....ok? I wanted to keep going but it was my partners work acquaintance‚Äôs house so I didn‚Äôt want to make a scene. Then later in the night she was admonishing one of their much wealthier neighbors simply for being wealthy. WHICH ONE IS IT, KAREN? The insecurity and ignorance was palpable."

me_irl,focvv2g,t1_foc1w0r,1587676566.0,"I broke down the difference between anxiety and panic attacks, and a description of each in a comment previously, so I‚Äôm going to repost it here for anyone who is curious. 


I‚Äôm late but posting this because many people think panic attacks and anxiety attacks and nervousness are all interchangeable terms, and don‚Äôt know the difference. Thus, they don‚Äôt know how to best treat themselves. I‚Äôve read a few comments that lead me to believe people might be confused as to what to label what they are feeling, and don‚Äôt understand why the suggestions of others don‚Äôt work for them. I‚Äôm going to skip nervousness because I think everyone knows what that feels like. 

In my own words, anxiety attacks are like a hurricane. You can see them coming. They can be mild or severe, and they can last for a little bit or a long time. Panic attacks are like a tornado. Often they come out of the sky right on top of you with very little warning. They can be really damaging but often don‚Äôt last long. When they do though, it‚Äôs usually really severe. In medical terms:

**Anxiety** attacks usually build up slowly and are highly correlated with excessive worry over a danger, whether it is real or imagined. You can almost always pinpoint the Danger. The symptoms are: 

‚Ä¢Difficulty concentrating, irritability, and restlessness. 

Physically you may feel: 

‚Ä¢Dizziness, disturbed sleep, fatigue, increased heart rate, muscle tension, and be startled easily. 

Unlike a panic attack, which *does* share some of these symptoms, the symptoms of anxiety may last for days, weeks, or even months. 

Therapy, medications, and self-help techniques are the recommended treatments. An emphasis on therapy and self-help is often sufficient, although some may definitely need medication. 


**Panic** attacks come on very suddenly and involves very intense feelings of fear, terror, apprehension, and/or nervousness. The symptoms are very severe and will disrupt your day. They usually come out of the blue, with no warning or no trigger, unless they are caused by a known trigger like a phobia. They often peak in 10 minutes then begin to subside, but they definitely can last hours. In my own experience, the ones that last hours require an ER visit. It‚Äôs an absolute must. The symptoms are: 

‚Ä¢Feelings of derealization and depersonalization, fear of losing control, and a fear of dying. 

Physically you may feel: 

‚Ä¢Pounding heart, excessive sweating, shaking, difficulty breathing, chest pain, abdominal distress, nausea, dizziness, numbness or tingling, chills, and hot flashes. 

Treatment for panic disorders are the same as anxiety disorders, although in very severe attacks, medication and or hospitalization are completely necessary."

AskMen,fobbsqg,t1_fo7adc7,1587658214.0,"If it did the change is minuscule. However during cycles it would definitely get bigger and more sensitive. To the point where walking was uncomfortable bc I was so sensitive. The only permanent changes for me were facial hair (just more peach fuzz, no dark hairs), I now get a couple random dark hairs on my nipples, my hair is a bit thinner but that could very well not be the cause. I think that‚Äôs it. Furthermore, if I workout occasionally, I‚Äôve been able to keep a lot of my mass. Nowhere near how much I had when I was on, and caring about diet, and working out consistently, so for whatever it‚Äôs worth."

That‚Äôs a lot. I was pretty big and strong. 

When people would say things insinuating I could beat a guy up I always disagreed. Even a man with a small build could have *easily* overtaken me I think. Y‚Äôall are just stronger for the most part"

Wellthatsucks,fo33k9m,t1_fo1x55s,1587479881.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry you lost your baby. I lost my Rottweiler to bone cancer a year ago and it was a slow and painful thing. He was only expected to live for two weeks but he lived for two months. He never showed he was in pain, and seemed perfectly happy, so I didn‚Äôt feel right putting him down. Despite his shoulder being shattered and him needing help with everything, he was a happy boy. He got SO many steaks. 

OP if you see this, if your vet tries to give you any drugs that have a side effect of urinating more frequently, and your beautiful girl is in pain when she moves, don‚Äôt give it to her. They tried to give my guy a drug to slow the cancer but it made him have to take trips outside constantly, which caused a lot of pain for no reason. He was going to die very soon anyway, there was no point in making him even more of a slave to his own body. Just my .02. 

Your dog is beautiful."

Somehow, I honestly don‚Äôt get how, when I was fumbling with the phone without actually looking at it, I called 911. All the sudden I heard a voice and being a half asleep moron, I hung up. They called right back and I explained it was an accident and I was SO sorry and they said ok and hung up. 

So I layed there for the next hour just waiting for the cops to show up to my house lol. And for my boyfriend to think I was looking through his phone, or get a bill for the incident. I had to explain it to him the next morning and he was just kinda puzzled lol. No cops or bill ever came though!"

optimisemylife,fnnz8ad,t1_fnnfeff,1587106453.0,"I‚Äôm just a gal offering unsolicited advice on your bunghole. Sorry in advance. 

As far as the hemorrhoid goes, that is almost always due to diet. If not, they usually go away. For example: pregnant women. Lots of pregnant women get them just due to the pressure, but once the baby is born and the body heals, the hemorrhoids go away. 

As far as the itchiness goes, I would assume it has to do with the wetness of the wipes and the chemicals in the wipes. This is where the bidet comes in. The bidet can clean you up completely, with just water, then all you need to do is blot dry with a very small amount of tp. It doesn‚Äôt hurt your b-hole or your pipes. I‚Äôm not a bidet shill, I don‚Äôt own any stocks, but...shit maybe I should!"
