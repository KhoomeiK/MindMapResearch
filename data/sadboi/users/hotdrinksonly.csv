depression,ez6nxqs,t3_d01jay,1567713871.0,"Shutting people down has become automatic for me now. Its not even a conscious decision.
I’ve perfected everything. The smile, the eyes, the sing-song voice when I say ‘fine!’ After they’ve asked me how I am.

Doesn’t make things any better. Just makes me want to end it"
