And usually that reputation can affect the parents. 

Like if you end up in jail.
You not only lose face , you also lose face for your parents, relatives because people will gossip and talk shit about your parents. 

Or if you chuck your parents to a rest home. You got religions which enhances the importance of taking care of your parents as they get old. You also got 三字經 and 弟子規 etc. It's can be shameful because from the parents point of view. They feed you, take care of you etc. To the person you are today. And all they want(not all) is to be able to get to see their son/daughter (would be nice if you can take care of them) and to socialize. They can get quite lonely if they feel isolated in the house or in rest homes. And also to bid them a farewell when the time comes. 


And if your rich, 
People would probably start complimenting your parents. 

Now, I believe they would do face-shaming moves themselves when: 

1. They no longer care. Eg. Wealth.
2. Didn't learn/have the chance to learn basic manners, respect etc. I've heard that most parts of China has lost their culture and traditions because of Mao (I don't know, something like that) 
3. Just plain rude.
