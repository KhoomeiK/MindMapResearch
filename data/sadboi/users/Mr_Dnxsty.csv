I'm not quite sure what qualifies as *majority of stocks* or *good companies* to you, nonetheless, you have no way of actually knowing that buying now will make you profit in the future. I'll agree that short term option players are the big losers and winners though.

This is all true, though assets due depreciate over time, good example being the food industry, they will have to throw out their supply due to lack of purchases and it going bad.

These companies aren't making money if there aren't any workers, some are even losing it. So no, workers will not just be brought back on, obviously unemployment won't stay at 30% (it's projected outcome by the end of the pandemic), but it will still be fairly high.
