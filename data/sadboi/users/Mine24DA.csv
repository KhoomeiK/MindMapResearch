A heart beat is not living, look at people on respirators, they are not living. Still birth children did not have experiences and meaningful connections with people that can be missed. What is missed is the potential of these things. But potential impossible things are always less important than reality. And I'm really sorry to say this, but giving birth does not make you a mother.

I am pro assisted suicide in terminal illnesses. Because these people are of sound mind. It is a logical decision. But for depression the wish to die is part of the illness. Therefore it would go against the medical profession to assist with the suicide instead of treating the illness. It would be against a medical standard. A terminal ill patient will die regardless, but a suicide will lessen their suffering. A depressed person doesn't have to die. Killing him cannot be a treatment, as it doesn't help him.

Great Britain has to deal with it colonial times. Germany accepts the holocaust, and teaches it etc. Just because other countries are bad doesn't mean turkey doesn't have to accept their history as well. Turkey also gets a lot of criticism  because they developed backwards in the last couple of years, and all the university students I talked to agreed on that one.

First of all, having children with him would be selfish and irresponsible without IVF, and it doesn't sound like you can afford that. Just because he has a mild case doesn't mean, that your children would have a mild case. And planning a child with a 50 percent chance of being disabled, where you don't know how severe it would be is just selfish in my opinion. 

Second point you have low self esteem, it sounds like you don't think you deserve love, and love your boyfriend because he is good to you and loves you despite all this. This is not a good base for a relationship. You should be happy and healthy on your own without relying for that on someone else. If you are not happy with your appearance change it. If you are overweight lose weight , it would be healthier any way. Your relationship started at an age where you were quite vulnerable, and it sounds like you use him like an emotional crutch, which is also unfair to him. 

Your boyfriend might be wonderful, I don't know. But you should be realistic. Your mum has a point saying to not have children. If you talk to a doctor about family planning they will say something similar. It is not fair to the unborn child to risk a disability, simply because you want children together. And you have to grow as a person first, before you can truly say that you love him for being him and not for how he makes you feel."
