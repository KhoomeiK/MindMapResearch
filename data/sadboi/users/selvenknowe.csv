In another essay, Renaissance scholar Mary Shay-Millea presents her case for it being Maddalena Strozzi due to a convincing resemblance in a contemporary portrait. In both cases, it’s likely the painting was commissioned on the occasion of a marriage, and the unicorn a symbol of the bride’s chastity.

2. The bible is a book, written by a bunch of dudes who call it the word of god to protect their own authority. As far as I know, there might not even *be* a god, so obviously I don't believe in divine inspiration. Inspiration for creative writing? Sure. But it ain't a deity.
3. I don't follow religious teachings in the same way a religious person does. If something sounds wise to me, then I will incorporate it into my personal philosophy. That's it.
4. Sexual orientation is not a ""lifestyle."" That's how religious people wiggle through acknowledging the wholeness of a person. It's as much a part of them as any other part of their biology. 
5. Paul was a sexist asshole. I don't care what he has to say about pretty much anything."
