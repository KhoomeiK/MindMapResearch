1) it was such a good chance to have a female doctor and not have it be about oooh look a female can do it tooo! 

2)we get it. Acceptance. EVERY freakin episode is about acceptance. Just give me Aliens and adventures with no real deeper meaning behind it. 

3) the now black doctor who is now a doctor before the hartell (1st doctor)! Cmon! I know In other episodes the timeline was messed with (like Clara going into the middle of the tardis) but MAKE. IT. WORK. you know? Blend it in. Don’t just mess with the time line.

I will buy the big block of soap on one purchase and then the other small stuff on another purchase and use the same coupon again. Once you have the molds and scents and dyes you’ll just have to buy soap. But that will be a bit of a lost at first. Up to now the people at Michaels haven’t told me there’s a limit to coupon use.

AskReddit,fj2t5dn,t3_faz5fq,1582953114.0,I was a housekeeper for a celebrity. They weren’t the problem. It was the very British and racist personal assistant you’d think she owned the place. But she lived in a dumpy little apartment in Hollywood. One time she needed to do some laundry and had to use their machines. No problem. Except that when I had to wash the homeowners clothes I had to take her clothes out.  So being the nice person I am I folded her clothes and put them on the side. When she came to pick them up I was ironing the owners clothes right next to the washer and dryer and she said “oh you folded them. I kinda didn’t really want you to touch them.” Wtf!!! I shoulda bleached them. Anyway I don’t clean houses anymore and work a regular desk job. And she had to move back to her country because her visa expired. Hah!
