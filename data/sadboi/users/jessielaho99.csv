Aquariums,ergx77v,t1_ergx21j,1560860978.0,"Aw okay, thanks! My partner was worried that they were ammonia burns or something."
Aquariums,eq2l2ve,t1_eq2k4h3,1559739330.0,"True! Maybe because we bought them in different times. We introduced our second blue gourami alone and our first bullied him, my partner had to put a jar in the corner of our tank incase he was ever mean, so he's not aggressive anymore. 

The two honeys we got came together so there werent any issues and neither for our sunset (who seemed really active, we she would be the bully lol) 

But no I dont think its during the feeding. I noticed the nipping, and just as I fed them, they've all came out and were eating peacefully.

We only just got the two flame gouramis so I guess I probably have to keep an eye out to see when exactly it happens"

Aquariums,epytvm4,t1_epyrxvi,1559650800.0,"At the moment we have two male dwarf gouramis, 2 honey gouramis, 5 tetras - we had 6 but one went missing randomly, have no idea where it went. And a sunset gourami.

I really want a gourami tank, but my partner said I can't get another one. I'm not sure what he has in mind."
relationship_advice,epysznw,t3_bwg1n4,1559650092.0,"Reading these posts are so annoying on a 1,000+ understanding level.

I don't know if its either to do with the generation OR the idea of their child being away from home making them feel insecure. I feel like a lot of mothers these days feel like we are obligated to bend over backwards because they've done so much, especially if it is impractical. 

My mum kicked me out a day after my birthday (after ignoring me for most of my birthday) and now that me and my partner are both working (and I'm studying as well) she will txt asking if i want to go a birthday to show face since she doesn't want to go, or asking if I want to go to a party or events that cause me spending money for us (things I dont even want to go to in general and she should know that, and not only that, letting me know only an hour or day before). And at the end of the day, she has 5 other kids at home, some of which are perfectly able to handle such things. But I don't know, maybe because of the generation these guys say they can't do it, or have no common sense, have been babied too much maybe? Or maybe its the fact that I'm not home anymore?

Sorry this turned into a rant.

Your mum should come around with some extreme talking from your day and time, its a shame your brother is babied so much that he probably wouldn't try to understand or intervene as a brother, knowing the situation you're in."

depression,epoytvn,t3_bv7l32,1559357932.0,"I understand this in many ways. It sucks! whenever I was sick, and I told her I couldn't do something cos I was unwell, she would say ""then go die,"" and i thought it was just me, but one day I heard her say it to my brother in a joking way, and it pissed me off in a whole new level. 

Mothers really feel like they can say anything to get their way, and no offense your not wrong in feeling mad, and I personally wouldnt kill myself over this and I know you wouldnt.

I can only say hang in there, things will get better. It just sucks to feel like we have to wait or cry or feel like we want to die, all to get some support from parents or anyone."
