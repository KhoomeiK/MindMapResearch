goth,fmcc3n1,t3_fue13m,1585942831.0,"I discovered the music when Kazaa came out when I was 8. Came across Rammstein and that just lead me down a wonderful rabbit hole. My parents split up and my dad took my shopping at hot topic to get back at my mom (I didn’t know that at the time but looking back I can see it) and since then I’ve always been like this. I’m turning 30 in a few weeks and I’ll always be like this. I got bullied a lot by the two other goth girls in the school. I wasn’t popular. I didn’t have a lot of friends and continued to sit with what I had for friends, the band geeks, at lunch. My mom has always told me I look like a clown even up until two years ago....I shut her out of my life then and forever for many circumstances. When I was 18 I finally had the chance to hit up the goth club Necto in Ann Arbor. It was a place where I finally fit in and made some good friends."

mentalhealth,fkxwqek,t3_flc7th,1584636902.0,"My anger issues ended up with a night in jail and 6 months probation and $1500 in fines. It takes something huge like that for you to realize what you are doing. The good thing is that you can see this happening. When all of this was happening to me, I started to seek help and treatment. Turned out that I have 6 mental illnesses and the medication that I'm taking for them has really helped. When I was on probation I was forced to take anger management classes and to my surprise, they worked. Therapy might help you too. It feels good to talk to someone you don't really know and just unleash your thoughts."
goth,fkxji6q,t3_fl1q05,1584629469.0,"My normie boyfriends were great at first but then the first one told me that he wishes his girlfriend wore normal clothes. And the second one turned out to be abusive but was obsessed with me for years before we dated and treated me like a queen for a short time.

I'm finally engaged to the love of my life. Hes a metal head. Get yourself a metal head."
insaneparents,fkub7ex,t3_fkh20v,1584546067.0,"My mom did this TWICE to me. All while I was staying at her house after a big break up and transitioning into my new apartment. I told her to not take my dog out WITHOUT the leash. Well, she did because she was too lazy to do it and because her dog doesn't need one. Then they kicked me out over it because I apparently didn't love my dog because I don't spend tons of money on him and I work a full time job. They told me to quit my job over being a single dog parent. I went to live in my car for about a month with my precious dog. It wasn't that bad."
goth,fku9z65,t3_fkp7du,1584545351.0,"I've been dressing like this since I was about 13. Mom said it was just a phase but here I am at my dream job.

I work for the number one dentistry school in the states. I do desktop support for the school. I was hired dressed like I am now. I don't dress up for interviews. If someone can't take me like this, then they don't deserve my hard work. My previous job was also a dream job for me (until I realized how terrible it was after 5 years).

I wear my typical leggings with platform boots and fun tshirts and hoodies to work. I'm just required to wear a lanyard with my school ID.

I work hard. I care for people. I get called a ""ray of sunshine"" a little too much."
mentalhealth,fku6qhy,t3_fkp8wx,1584543432.0,Just be there to support her. I'm sure she will tell you when she is ready. Mental illness is a hard thing to talk about for a lot of people. I will always be dependent on multiple medications until I die for my multiple mental problems. Don't see her as less of a person. Her brain just isn't giving her the correct chemicals and she needs those pills to simulate those chemicals.

mentalhealth,fkeh3y8,t3_fhmdsj,1584113061.0,I'm terrified. My anxiety is now 10x worse. Taking the day hour by hour is hard. I also like knowing answers and there are so many unknowns right now. This has decreased my work performance because I cannot concentrate. I also ran out of a medication that I need and now with my new insurance I cannot afford it. So I just have these looping thoughts that won't get out of my head and I'm panicking.
retail,fkc85xd,t3_fhbhvf,1584047694.0,"I used to work retail for over ten years. The stores I have worked at never had a birthday discount or item. But I would still get excited with the customer about their special day, well, because it is special. My birthday is also my special day. I don't have many events in my life and to me, that one should be a fun day. I don't go into a store announcing it's my birthday but I will still get excited with a customer or stranger about their special day."
