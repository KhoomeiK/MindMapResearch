Since he took my virginity i thought maybe i should just stick with him and see if he would want to be in a relationship. Little did i know the relationship i was to him was when he was rejected by other girls and then make me feel like he wanted to be in a ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationship with me. He did this on and off for three years and i let him. I‚Äôm just as much to blame by letting him come and go. Even when my grandma died and i was devastated, he pretended he wanted to comfort me but just came over, fucked me, and left more broken every time. Pot eventually helped me make changes. I finally blocked him and told him to never text me or contact me again. I changed career paths and am on track to becoming a nurse. While I‚Äôve been able to move on and be completely functional part of me feels empty and dead. I numb myself and find it hard to love myself. Most days i wish i wasn‚Äôt alive (not suicidal).

So now since i have a harder time falling asleep as early and have been more productive at night i just shift my day. I sleep at least 7-8 hours. When i wake up workout right away. Achieving the small goal of working out and getting ready puts me in the flow of productivity so i can start my studies. I take breaks and reward myself. I stopped video games while i was in school because i didn‚Äôt want to be distracted. Because of current quarantine circumstance i allow myself to play as a reward and it helps me get in social time with friends that i play with online. I kinda just set what i need to get done and as long as i get it done i don‚Äôt care about the order but i still try to control what I can but don‚Äôt hate myself if i don‚Äôt and just try to be better the next day or change something.

A change happened in my life and i just got out of my routine and haven‚Äôt been able to sleep much since. I get anxiety when it comes to thinking of sleep and having to do it. Now with school being moved to online and being quarantined I‚Äôm just not use to the normal ways of dealing with things. Sadly leaving to work at my hospital is the only i look forward too but also cause me stress because i hate to potentially infect family when i come home (haven‚Äôt had to deal with any covid patients yet). Even pot stopped helping my fall asleep but it does calm me and keep me moving forward. I downloaded headspace and listen to their sleep cast. So far I‚Äôll put one on and sit on my bed with no phone or laptop or distraction and just listen to it. I swear it puts me to sleep within 15 min

FemaleDatingStrategy,fjcrwb3,t3_f6w46w,1583234160.0,"While i agree with you, i think and even more powerful message to take from your experience is to really learn to value yourself. To learn who you are and find a way to love yourself. This may come off as a generalization and i don‚Äôt hope to do that, but based on many different men i have been with I want to share that any man can be a predator. 

I think girls have this need to feel validated by someone. As a 22 year old i forgot who i was. Instead of working on myself i thought a guy and a relationship would help. Sadly someone who i thought cared about me disregarded my desires to not have sex. One night he finally forced me and got his way with me leaving me even more confused and broken. 3 years of allowing him to continue to use me for sex. I think to process the situation and not feel like he took away something i wanted to share with someone i loved, i really hoped he would maybe one day love me. Eventually things ended for good and sadly I tried to be strong and be the one to end it but he won again. 

This led me to not have a healthy relationship with men. I would develop feelings for guys i knew only wanted me for sex. I was so willing to listen to all their lies and overlook red flags all because i desperately looked for validation. I stopped opening up and never told anyone about my situation. I learned to suffer in silence. Some days i was numb. I really lost sight in who i was. 
and not burden others. I felt like i was responsible for things turning out how they did. I know i didn‚Äôt ask for someone to rape me, but i take some responsibility for not being more forceful with saying no. I said no for so long that eventually i stopped. 

Through so many bad experiences and even good I have finally come to the conclusion that the best defense against predators is self love.
Women know your value and your worth. A guy can‚Äôt make you happy. Money can‚Äôt make you happy. Discovering yourself and finding happiness despite the crap in life is what gives you strength. Being a kind and loving person. Achieving goals you care about. Some men are predators and the best protection is self improvement and empowering yourself. Never stop trying or improving."

Even just taking a walk to think and get out of the house. Try to disassociate circumstances to happiness. Happiness is an effort. It‚Äôs a choice. Choose to focus on the good when there is bad. Allow yourself to feel the sad or anger or bad but don‚Äôt dwell on it. Refocus on goals and the things that make you happy. Focus on helping others and being a good person to people around you. We all have to go through life and it‚Äôs a hard experience. Just knowing that we try to lift and support helps.

I just started nursing school and it is incredibly busy and I keep telling myself that is my focus. I can‚Äôt let anything else get in the way. I focus on how i treat others and what I can do to be there for someone. It has helped me a lot to focus less on me and what i don‚Äôt have. Try to focus on the small positive things. Be active.
