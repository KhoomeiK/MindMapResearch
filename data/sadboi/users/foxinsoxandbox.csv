But at least I can give them the info and help I needed as a kid.) The book opened my eyes to the possibility of bipolar and I got myself to a p-doc as soon as I could.

When I screw up (hello, rage), I make sure to apologize to them and give an explanation, along with (for the older ones) make sure I explain steps I’m taking to recognize the problem and prevent as many future outbursts. We are a neurodiverse household, so I’m doing my best to make sure that mental health is something that is openly discussed at home and not stigmatized, and that we are a med-friendly household where it’s not considered any different than wearing glasses to correct vision.
