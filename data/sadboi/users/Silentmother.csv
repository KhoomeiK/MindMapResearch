depression,fdgjy72,t3_ejsoej,1578399793.0,"It feels like you’d do anything To just stop breathing and crying while everyone pretends you don’t exist 

I’m a single mother of three living with my mother and siblings their older 
I used to cry infront of them until they started making fun of me 
Saying I’m crying out of manipulation 
I’m crying cuz I’m stupid or loser 
They would say go back to your ex husband better let him help you with you life...
My ex husband mentally abused me for 3 years and cheated more than once.
Now I found this who helps me but my family hate him cuz he’s poor In their eyes and helps with my kids when I’m down or pressured but they don’t want him to help or visit for long or even sleep next to me it’s not allowed my other siblings it’s fine but not me cuz he’s broke in their eyes he work doesn’t earn much but he tries 
I don’t care he is but he’s so nice I haven’t had nice in a while....I’m to broke myself to move out and I can’t get a job my kids are to young and I get a nanny cuz no one wants to help me 

I hate saying all this but who els do I explain this without looking stupid.  

I just want to stop feeling or breathing I wish I didn’t feel this way I have kids but it’s all I could think of..."
