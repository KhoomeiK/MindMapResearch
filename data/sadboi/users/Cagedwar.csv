It’s a real issue. I agree. It’s almost as if I am one of the only kids that took it all seriously. Everyone else seems to do whatever the fuck they want but I feel like I have this pit inside of me due to religion.

I was blissfully ignorant as a kid and after abuse in my family and a church turning their back I decided to start thinking. It’s not logical. Seriously read the Bible and just think “is this logical?” The answer is no.

Then I thought, even if it’s true. Why would I support this God? He’s all powerful and everywhere but he doesn’t stop rape? So he literally watches children get raped and abused and he doesn’t do anything to help? That is literally evil. Not to mention if people don’t believe in him (which he didn’t make easy) they are tortured forever? LIKE FOREVER??? How the fuck can I say he’s a good guy???
