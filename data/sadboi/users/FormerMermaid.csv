Weightlosstechniques,fiqlra1,t3_f973m3,1582647018.0,"I have struggled with an extra 15-25 pounds all my life.  This year starting on January 1st I gave up all foods with added sugar. Not sure how I did it as I love food and especially sweets, but something about it being the beginning of the decade made me want to start fresh.  I have a 3-pronged approach: no added sugar,  40-50 minutes on the treadmill every single day, and intermittent fasting (no food between 7pm and 11am, most days).  This is working for me and I have gone from 158 to 148 since January 1st, without counting calories.  I get a little thrill out of telling people that I haven't eaten anything with added sugar in this decade :) 
Good luck, I hope you are successful with whatever approach you take."

However, that side effect passed and the weight eventually came back.  I suffer from restless legs syndrome which the fluoxetine exacerbated a lot.  I have tried multiple times to wait it out, hoping that side effect would pass but it never did.  Finally, fluoxetine gives me anorgasmia, even at a low dose.  That too did not pass with time, so I eventually gave up on this medication completely and won't try it again at any dose."

Also, if you can afford it and find the time, I would recommend having a regular massage for the physical tension.  I've suffered from that my whole life and massage helps me.  Regarding exercise, it really does make a difference in mood -- instead of the treadmill could you start by putting on some happy music and doing some vigorous dancing with your kids?  I'm a big proponent of the mood-lifting power of music and movement.  I have no comments on the medication because in 30 years of trying many meds and combos (including all the ones you're currently taking) I have never found the right one(s).
