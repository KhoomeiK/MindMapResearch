Advice,fiouoqc,t3_f8ynvq,1582591407.0,"I have three cats and while I love them dearly, they can be filthy little creatures. Having nine of them can't be sanitary for you guys or the cats. Definitely start by checking to see if they're microchipped. Ultimately, you will have to make it very clear to her that this is not acceptable for you. You aren't being unreasonable by wanting to set limits. Finding homes for them is a temporary fix, as she will most likely adopt more of them."
puppy101,fin4lun,t1_fin4547,1582555644.0,"My youngest definitely has a personal space problem with animals. Something we have to remind her of constantly. A few of the incidences have been caused by this. Other times, there's no discernible reason why she growls and nips. My husband and I are extremely worried she's going to really hurt one of the kids."
puppy101,fin47ej,t1_fin3du8,1582555366.0,"She definitely doesn't seem to like being hugged or pinned in any way and that is something we try not to do. The most recent incident, yesterday, she was licking my daughter's arms, tail wagging, butt wiggling. Then with no warning whatsoever she did a small growl and bit at her face. My daughter's face was a good foot and a half away from her so she wasn't invading her personal space."
