Advice,fafg4vw,t3_e8qjej,1576021908.0,"i would say to tell your parents you will still be in the medical field first of all. the number of psychologists in the world is extremely low, along with growing growing recognition of mental health issues which will only heighten demand. this makes job availability pretty high. im not sure which strand of phychology you want to go into but i looked it up and the average psychiatrist salary in the US is $216,090 annually, reaching an average of $260,000 in california. comparing this to the average $294,000 salary of a doctor in the US, theyre very close. (im focusing on psychiatrists because thats the easiest to find) psychiatrists in the US also recieve full benefits such as general health care, dentistry, and vision. they could argue that you get from being a doctor will save you money, but as i said psychiatrists get the same ones. also, being a psychiatrist/psychologist will allow to have much more flexible hours compared to that of say a surgeon as not as many psychiatric cases are emergent or require immediate care. this can let your parents be able to spend more time with you.

imo it would be best to go with a fact based argument if they only want you to be able to support yourself. a few google searches can give you some statistics which might help you and salary and schooling is super simple to find. good luck convincing them!

edit: i just saw youre from southeast asia so bear with me while i get new statistics

here is the link that i looked at:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1489866/

it seems as though pursuing psychiatry or psychology in asia is more predominantly difficult that in north american countries. i couldnt find much information regarding salary or education in asia, let alone southeast asia. however, from what i gathered from that article i listed, it seems that there is still a lot of stigma around mental health in the continent which i assume would make the field harder to get into. the possibility of successfully pursuing the career would depend on whether or not youre willing to emigrate first of all. i saw in another comment that you have a fear of school shootings in the US. i live in canada so i dont blame you for that as we hear about them all the time. i will also add that because of demand for medical/law degrees in particular, university costs are staggeringly high. (i saw this in someone elses comment, they had links with the information there). some universities start their tution at almost $50,000 a year. additional it would depend on whether or not you would stay in that country after you got your degree. 

i know most about canada as i live here so i can say that to become a psychologist it is a minimum of 6 years of schooling (4 years for a bachelor in psychology and 2 years for a masters). tuition is around $14,000-$18,000 for international students, so significantly cheaper than american schools. the average salary for a psychologist in canada was $77,000 anually, but that was in 2014 and has most definitely gotten higher since then. psychogists in a private practice make $100,000-$200,000 anually, which is close to the salary of a doctor.
