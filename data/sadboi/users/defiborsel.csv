I don't exactly have the capacity to help people much, I've tried but it always ends up backfiring and I don't want to visit those kind of subs because it takes a matter of seconds to be triggered or consumed with frustration or bitterness when I do. I wish you'd stop giving advice but if you are going to do so, that is actually decent.

&#x200B;

I get that you somewhat know what I feel when listening to those songs but I think you're smart enough to be aware that the reactions you and me have to them are not the same at all; at least don't stem from the same place. Remember, I've been alive just a little over as long as you were married.

&#x200B;

I understand the utility in changing a mindset but, again, I think/have enough faith in your intellect to believe that you know that's glossing over many nuances, hurdles and complications.

&#x200B;

Hospitalisation or any kind of outpatient treatment is not at all an option, fiscally, logistically and given the current pandemic. Not to mention my distaste for the system. I tried to contact therapists recently but they've left me on read for a while and I honestly don't see much of a point anymore if it didn't work for years.

&#x200B;

Thank you for caring a little more than most, however I believe that's not what I or most mean when we say one can't/doesn't care about us on the internet. Your posts themselves are clear enough indication that you believe in a certain baseline of worth in people which makes them deserving of living, and while I'm not here to argue with you about the implications of that, know that caring for everyone doesn't mean caring about everyone.  


Thank you for taking the time to write a response to my post (again), though!"

Hey man, if it helps at all, I'm 19M too, same situation as yours. I've had hookers and, you're right, it's not the same.

I don't have advice because I don't really intend on making it past 20 either but... maybe you could talk to me? If you'd like, you can go through my profile, see how similar or not our stories are? I feel the same anger at the world that you do bro, they don't fucking get it, they'll just tell us its not a big deal, its not worth killing ourselves over, that you just gotta ""love yourself"" and all that fuckshit. I'm here to tell you that, if you ever need someone who won't tell you that, I'm here, okay?  


Also, its worth mentioning, platonic relationships with women and hobbies both help. Not in the way most people think, they won't necessarily lead you to a girl somehow... they might or they might not. But they do help. I am glad for all the women I got to befriend and form real emotional bonds with, even if they were mostly online, even if I know there'd never be anything romantic. Knowing the kind of shit so many of the loveliest women have to go through on a daily basis, you get to learn that they're not that different from you and I. Even the prettiest ones don't always find someone who'll love them for them, y'know? A woman once told me, ""wanting someone to love you for what you look and act like and wanting someone to love you for something other than what you look and act like are 2 sides of the same issue.""  


We're all being pigeonholed into ideas based on our looks. We all just want to be loved for who we are man. And while I'll root for you every day that that does happen for you, well, I'm here regardless, tovarisch, so you don't have to feel completely alone on this proverbial boat in the middle of nowhere.

CPTSD,fphsgqo,t3_gdisfx,1588626978.0,"Hello!

&#x200B;

I'm not usually the one on this side of support, so there is going to be an unfortunate amount of explanation of my situation, but I feel like I had to respond to this. Just a little bit of context, please bear with me; I am an Indian male, living in India (idk if you are an NRI or not but I felt like it is worth mentioning so you'd know my perspective in this).

&#x200B;

I do understand how absolutely difficult it can be for you birthgivers to not accept this.

&#x200B;

Actually... I don't.

&#x200B;

But here's what I do know; my mother has always impressed upon me that she will never consider any bride I may bring home worthy of her acceptance unless she's ""non-Indian"" (sometimes outright saying ""white"" sometimes not). Almost diametrically opposite problem, huh? She's exclusively dated white men after leaving my dad and then leaving me. And, unlike most Indian families, she has made it clear to me that arranged marriage is not something she'll consider for me, since my father was physically, sexually and emotionally abusive to her, and that's the environment I had to grow up in. I'm not going to get into my story but... just know that I know how much it fucking sucks to have to rely on people who won't accept who you really love, or even the very situation of your sexuality/relationship ""status"" (if you could allow me to be personal just *one more time*, she is never ready to talk to me about how lonely I feel romantically, convinced I'll never have a romantic relationship, but she also does agree with me for the most part on that).

&#x200B;

I'm really, really sorry if reading that wasn't what you wanted to hear, but all of that bears mentioning so that you know that I'm saying this from the deepest part of my heart, the same heart that knows how much birthgivers and their expectations and their lack of support can truly fucking suck, when I say this;

&#x200B;

**I am so, so happy you found someone who makes you happy. It fills my heart with joy to know that a soul as lovely as yours found another one to truly share life with.**

&#x200B;

There will be ups, there will downs. Between him and you. Between you and anyone who may be against this blessed union. I just want you to know that, in the end, it will only be your love, your bond with him that truly matters.

&#x200B;

You and him must, and I mean **must** constantly work on bettering yourselves. Bringing out the absolute best in each other, and caring for each other at your absolute worst. To find someone who you can even call the love of your life, its truly a rare and special gift, but the gift itself is but one of many that can come out of this.

&#x200B;

No one can question this union but the one's involved. Only you and him know how true your love is, how deep it runs within you both. It is 100% okay for you to want the support you fear you'll never get; its natural for you to want that validation. And you deserve that.

&#x200B;

Because what would love be without celebration? Among the both of you and among the world that can cherish it.

&#x200B;

You need to cherish it. I hope you do. Because you deserve to. Because this is the part of your life where you're accepted for who you are, not abused for who someone else wants you to be.

&#x200B;

I am so proud of you and so happy for you to have found and truly clung onto such a special bond. I am so proud of you for giving love your all despite every card that has ever been dealt against you. Against your bond.

&#x200B;

I wish you both nothing but the best. Always. <3

SuicideWatch,fozeqpx,t1_foze0lx,1588189427.0,"I attempted 7 years ago, 5 years ago, 3 years ago (technically twice) and this year. I 100% agree that it's sometimes telling the world that you're not okay, but then who the fuck listens? It's not like the movies where you'll have friends with tears in their eyes come running to see if you're okay now is it.

Fuck therapists. That's the real mistake I made over the last 5 years; wasting those years on therapists and medication and working out and dieting. All just shit that made me feel worse.

I haven't been a different person since being that suicidal 13 year old. No amount of therapy or moving away and living alone could change that."
SuicideWatch,foyoe7s,t1_foyo8x6,1588176179.0,"What... Why are you doing this to me why are you making me feel crazy for something I didn't even bring up, you did. I never brought up having a child why"
SuicideWatch,foyo66m,t1_foynwe2,1588176063.0,Not really. I never said I did either.
SuicideWatch,foyo2te,t1_foynkgi,1588176013.0,"I was more aiming for the kind of people who agrees with that video of the guy who jumped off the golden gate bridge and survived (and many other examples like that), but what you're saying is probably a large portion of it too."
SuicideWatch,foynt0c,t1_foynk0f,1588175868.0,Why the fuck would I want to do that to a child???
SuicideWatch,foymfj5,t1_foykebh,1588175147.0,"Not the one who commented that and I agree with you that it's just generally shitty advice but I'm saying that as someone who has tried it. I was able to use money I had saved up through odd jobs and mostly loaning from my grandpa, I don't regret moving away but it didnt make anything easier (most things just got harder and worse)"
SuicideWatch,foyixmr,t1_foyif9a,1588173359.0,"I'm glad you find shit easier to deal with but you can't just go around saying it like its a universal truth. I've had therapy and medication for years, professional and alternate, I've worked out and worked with a dietician too; literally all of that only made it worse. You can share what helped you but you can't just ask me to ""trust"" you that it gets magically easier to deal with."
SuicideWatch,foyhurj,t1_foyghmd,1588172799.0,I wish I knew what that felt like... Really sorry to hear about the diabetes though. It's been in my family for generations and will probably end up affecting me soon if I don't die soon enough.
SuicideWatch,foygmf3,t1_foyfxc4,1588172165.0,"Oh yeah I moved across my country too, went to a new college even though I wasn't technically over with the one I was in before, got an apartment, even dropped 250mics twice; felt nothing but a slight headache. Idk how trips work. Either way, that was all last year and it's not made anything better but eh"
SuicideWatch,foyfl7x,t1_foyf71z,1588171631.0,Makes sense. I just wish people who attempted and are thankful they didn't succeed didn't use it against people who want to die (remember that video of the guy who jumped off the golden gate bridge?)
SuicideWatch,foyevxw,t1_foyeqnr,1588171265.0,What
SuicideWatch,foyet0n,t1_foye4yl,1588171222.0,Yeah. It's all on my profile...
SuicideWatch,foye4ax,t1_foydvim,1588170859.0,I'd love a gun maybe I'd stop failing so many times since I'm just too fucking fat to hang myself
SuicideWatch,foybs0y,t1_foybpgc,1588169590.0,"Not really, considering I don't see that ever easing the suffering if it does happen."
SuicideWatch,foybh6g,t1_foybc9t,1588169420.0,"I've failed multiple attempts since I was 13, I still regret not just fucking dying then. It only gets worse"
SuicideWatch,foyb52e,t1_foyabti,1588169232.0,Why?
SuicideWatch,foy9j9t,t1_foy8rh3,1588168304.0,"I regret making this post if all it lead to was that fake-feel-good empty platitude based on a metaphor so baseless and stretched so thin I can practically use it as a veil. What's next, ""it gets better?"""
SuicideWatch,foy8afp,t1_foy75ed,1588167545.0,...what does that have to do with anything?
SuicideWatch,foy6ckb,t1_foy5c5t,1588166326.0,"I want her to hear it, sure, but if she doesn't even fucking exist then there's not really any point. Besides, you and me both know music isn't some great therapeutic outlet of pain that we rely on; ""Good musicians make good music despite mental illnesses, not because of them."""
