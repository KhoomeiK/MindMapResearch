BPDrecovery,fkmposl,t3_fje6vf,1584335656.0,"I can relate all too well, and it’s something I have started to figure out but it’s a battle for sure.

I try to do something simple, but still “productive” if that makes sense. Baths are a safe place for me, so if I’m able to enjoy nice smelling bubbles, or a bath bomb (there are lots of affordable options out there, but Lush has my heart haha). Lavender Epsom salts are just lovely and so very calming. I’ll do a face mask and a conditioning treatment for my hair (I bleached off half my bangs a month or so ago so...that’s pretty necessary LOL). I’ll throw on a podcast or a YouTube video I’ve been meaning to watch, or some music that I enjoy. Hayley Williams released some solo stuff recently and has an album out in May, so that’s been very comforting for me. Everyone has their own tastes though!

With that, I can file it under self care, so it’s still considered productive. I have a better sleep when I’m relaxed, if I have a better sleep I have a better appetite the next day, which in turn helps my brain function and cope better. If I take care of my skin, I don’t have to feel as self conscious about the way I look. If I smell nice after a bath, I can be a little more confident. Having a reason behind the nice thing helps my brain to accept the nice thing.

It also helps me to schedule “me time”. A specific block of time where I give myself permission to treat myself with some extra kindness. All habits take time to settle in, so be patient with yourself. (Easier said than done with BPD though, I know that feeling.)

When I can trick my brain into believing that the nice thing is still productive, it helps make the guilty feeling fuck off for a while or at least be a tad less powerful. Some days are better than others but it takes practice. You are not alone in those feelings at all, and you have every right to do nice things for yourself regardless of what this illness tries to convince you of. You are worthy of being kind to yourself. Best of luck <3"

Pretty sure I’ve used nearly every shade of Manic Panic at this point, which is amusing to me because the brand name describes how I feel when “I NEED TO CHANGE MY HAIR COLOUR RIGHT NOW”. Moved onto Special Effects until I couldn’t find it anymore in my corner of Canada, Punky Color, Arctic Fox, had to try Good Dye Young due to my 13 year long Paramore obsession too hahaha.

I’ve also had sooo many different styles and cuts. Had a mohawk for a while. Shaved my head after a bleach mishap (40VOL on already damaged hair. Never. Again.) and the guy I was dating went off about how I’d “be prettier if I grew out the mohawk and got rid of the piercings” so...yeah, shaved head. I rocked it though and it was FUN. Then I had a wig phase.

I starting doing synthetic dreadlock extensions a few years back and I’ve had lots of fun with it. It’s been the most consistent style I’ve had in a very long time and I LOVE THEM. Sometimes I’ll shave the sides, sometimes I’ll grow them out and have a full dreadhead. It’s amusing to look back at all my dread sets and see a myriad of colours. Right now I have split black & silver bangs, shaved sides, and my dreads go from black to a silver ombré. I’m growing my sides back out though and I’m planning on doing the black & silver split over my entire head.

I’ve never had much control over other aspects of my life, but I find comfort in my hair and the fact that I do it because I want to. It’s for me, and only me.

That ended up being a long winded thing LOL. But I do that, I’m a rambler."

BPD,f50msx0,t1_f50i1r6,1571929784.0,"My parents and I adventured from Alberta to Vancouver to see The Who. They’re my Dad’s all time favourite band, so we wanted to see them while we still can. Pete and Roger are in their 70’s so who knows. There’s gonna be a new Who album out on Dec 6th, so I’m glad I have a new album to be excited for. They had a full orchestra for parts of the show and it was just...wow. Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam even randomly showed up to perform a song with them. I’m still mentally processing that concert, it was just surreal. My dream art school is in Vancouver too, so it was cool to finally get to visit the city.

I am so excited for when you’re able to get that lovely mermaid colour back!! It is SO fun. I recently had green hair with wool dread extensions for quite a while, but now I have a silver fringe with kanekalon extensions that go from black to a silver ombré. I’ll always go back to green every so often because it’s my fav colour, but I’m loving how my hair is at the minute. Good Dye Young has this turquoise that is just LOVELY and it’s been on my “want to try list” for a while. It’s not the cheapest, but a tiny bit of dye really goes a long way with that brand. I’m a huge Paramore fan so I’m a little biased, but it’s a great brand of dye if you can get your hands on it.

I feel ya with the guitar backaches. I usually have to sit to play due to (mild thank goodness) scoliosis, but having a 3/4 sized acoustic helps a bit. The first instrument I really learned was ukulele, and it was nice and light. My back liked that quite a bit haha. Picking up uke made guitar a lot less intimidating too, and it’s just so cheery. I’d recommend uke for just about anyone.

One of my favourite bands has a vocalist with synesthesia actually! I’d bet it would be fun to just get a bunch of paints, put on some favourite music, and just go. I bet that would be really interesting. The thing I love about more abstract artwork is that there aren’t really any “rules”. Just do what ya want. It’s great!"
BPD,f4z48ph,t3_dm6y8r,1571894212.0,"Love this idea!

One thing I really like about myself is my creativity. I am VERY much an artist type, and even though I’ve doubted where my skills are at with each creative endeavour at one point or another, I’m proud of my ability to bounce from one creative outlet to the next and continue challenging myself in different ways. Whether it’s drawing, music, or messing around with hair dye and ending up with something fun. Haven’t had “normal” hair in years.

I love visual art and I would love to be a tattoo artist someday after honing my skill set more (I’d like to be someone that specializes in scar cover-ups because...well, I’ve been there). I’m still kind of a newbie with my guitar, but I’ve fallen in love with it and it’s become such a healthy outlet for me. Been playing it for almost four years and I’m proud of my progress. No lessons due to a lack of funds for it, but I’m proud of how far I’ve come just being self-taught and using that creativity within myself to learn new things.

I have something called Trichotillomania, where I tend to pull my hair whenever dealing with stress, bored, or just from the compulsion. I still pull my lashes and it’s a hard thing to kick, but wearing dreadlock extensions has stopped the pulling from my head and I ended up pulling my brows so bad a few years back that I just went “ah screw it” and shaved them off. I was really, really insecure about how I’d never be able to make my brows look quite “real” enough and having that uncanny valley effect drawing them on, so I went with the other option and started playing with more “artsy” looks and just having fun with it rather than stressing and causing more eyelash pulling in turn. It’s not a widely known thing, but it’s actually more common than people may think. To each their own for sure, but I figure makeup can always wash off and I can just simply try again c:

I’ve heard that about Pravana! Lovely shades, but the bleeding can be a nuisance. I used their red and a blue for a friend’s hair and it ended up EVERYWHERE. His hair looked fantastic, but oh god the bleeding.

Manic Panic has stained for me as well, and I’m just a constantly shifting rainbow...so that can be a little tricky at times for sure. Purples and warmer shades tend to stain more in my experience too. Not sure if that’s just me though.

I haven’t tried to change my colour since I first tried Arctic Fox, but I’ve heard from a lot of people that it doesn’t stain nearly as bad as some others. I’ve also only dealt with bleeding maybe right after I dye and washing my hair in cold water makes a HUGE difference too. Only tried the green and yellow mix so far, so I’m not sure about deeper, warmer shades. (Yet haha. Wine red, purple mix is next on my list)

That is exactly why I stay faaar away from Splat. It’s ruined many a towel and pillowcase, and as a dumb teen who didn’t have the knowledge yet...I overused their bleach. I rocked the buzz cut but that taught me quite the lesson that I will never ever forget 😂"
HairDye,erovba4,t3_c35l3d,1561089770.0,"I used to be a regular Manic Panic user back when I first started out, and I did notice that it faded faster than other dyes I’ve tried over the years. The initial colour payoff was fantastic though!

Arctic Fox is lovely! There are lots of colour options, it smells wonderful, and my hair always feels conditioned and healthy after a touch up. I have green hair (Iris Green mixed with Neon Moon 💚) and a HUGE pro about Arctic Fox dye is how easy it is to mix shades so you can find just the right combo for what you like. I have noticed a bit of fading, but not as much as I had with Manic Panic. I would choose Arctic Fox over Manic Panic personally.

I just started using Good Dye Young because I’m a MASSIVE Paramore fan and got excited about it finally being available in Canada, and that’s another dye I would absolutely recommend. Only tried their green shade so far, but I grabbed a purple for when I have my next set of wool dreads all made up and I’m finally sick of the green. They don’t have as many shade options available as they are relatively new, but the quality is great.
