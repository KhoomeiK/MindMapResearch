I know my thing with even numbers started in elementary school when the teacher was explaining what even and odd numbers were and she said something like, if you have 7 people and put them in pairs there will always 1 person alone.

Pets,fj2ecx5,t3_fazjzz,1582941513.0,"Before they meet you can play with you cat so much that they are really really tired so they won’t have much energy, might not stop them but it could help so they don’t since they will be tired. 

Also whenever they do meet watch them very closely, cats usually give signs before attacking so if the cat shows a sign like if they hiss or go to swat the dog or anything separate them. 
Also I say keep the dog on a leash the whole time. One person holds the dogs leash and one person stays near the cat just in case they try anything. 
You really don’t want them to fight at all. 

Maybe wear an oven mitt so just in case they do actually start to fight you can just put your hand in there and basically push the cat off and whoever is holding the dogs leash will pull them back away from the cat. Loud noises could also stop them from fighting but it doesn’t always. 

Maybe put the cat also on a leash 🤷‍♀️ but not all cats are okay with that so you would have to test how your cat reacts to the leash first and go from that, one of my cats is perfectly fine and feels safe with a leash and my other two cats just feel frightened.

Maybe if you can play with them in the same space. Somebody plays with the cat and somebody plays with the dog so they aren’t focusing on each other. 
Could work if the cat has a certain toy or something that really keeps their attention."

Pets,fiv2aq4,t1_fiv0wqj,1582752532.0,"Honestly than it seems you may have to try reintroducing them. I’m assuming they are about the same age from what you have said so it can’t be an issue of one of them is just old 🤷‍♀️

Maybe try playing with the one who wants to just play around and try tiring them out so they won’t feel much of a need to play with the other cat and instead maybe will just lay down with them which hopefully will work. 

I’ve had kind of the same issue before where one of my cats wanted to play and the other one didn’t except I ended up getting a dog as a present so my cat who wanted to play ended up playing with the dog who was a puppy and stopped trying to play with the cat who didn’t want to so than they just ended up sleeping together like normal which was lucky for me and great. This is why I’m thinking maybe tiring the playful cat out might help their relationship if it’s really an issue of the cat being playful and the other cat not being playful."

I have to force myself to not get more pets cause I’m legit running out of space lol and my life is basically consumed with taking care of them and playing with the pets I can actually play with. 
I wouldn’t change it but it is a lot sometimes but my pets also give me a reason to get out of bed everyday even if it’s just to feed them or something."
Pets,fiv0nip,t3_f9urcm,1582751673.0,"So like was it only the cats who hated it when they met or did the dog also hate it? If the dog didn’t hate them than it’s mostly about getting the cats used to this big giant lol. Cats can be more standoffish whenever it comes to meeting others who are bigger than them but it doesn’t mean they will never get along. Leave things with the cats scent with the dog and give the cats something with the dogs scent so they already know the scent. 

Try having them meet as much as you can and just make sure when you do that you have a handle on all of the animals. Do not let them fight at all. If they start fighting they will associate whoever they fought with that negativity and that’s harder to come back from and it’ll also cause them to fight more and more. 
Most people don’t have their cats leash trained but I would keep the dog on a leash and if the cats wants to look like they are preparing to attack the dog try making a loud noise because it’s usually better to do that and make the cat run away than to let them fight. You can also try having the dog on a lead or even in a cage and the cats in a cage and put them next to each other just so they can see and smell each other but can’t actually fight. People usually do this with dogs but it could work with cats and dogs honestly. 


In your new place pick a wall for just the cats and build shelves up the wall that can easily hold the cats so if they need to they can get up high away from the dog, this is just good all around even if they don’t actually have to get away from the dog it gives them an option to if they simply just don’t want to be bothered by the dog. 
I would say a tall cat tower but I know my dog could knock a cat tower down easily even if he isn’t trying to. 


Everything you have to do is really just making them associate the other one with good and positivity instead of bad and negative. 

Maybe if you can find a place that neither the cats or dog have claimed as their territory so they can meet ? It’s better to not have anything that’s already claimed to fight over which the new place would be new territory but it would be great if you can have them meet in a neutral territory before that but not everybody can 🤷‍♀️"
Pets,fiuyjz2,t3_f9x1ie,1582750581.0,Oh also if one of them isn’t fixed than that could be an issue and I know sometimes when cats are bored they can lash out🤷‍♀️ the cat could just have too much energy built up.
Pets,fiuydxh,t3_f9x1ie,1582750495.0,"Maybe try reintroducing them to each other? 
Basically what you do is one of them gets put into a room and the other one doesn’t. 
Whenever you feed them everyday you start inching up their food bowls closer and closer to the door so eventually they are eating next to each other and can smell each other but the door is blocking them from seeing the other one and they can’t fight. 
While this is going on you can also try switching them around like cat A is in the room and cat B isn’t in the room and than you switch them so now cat B is now in the room and cat A is not and do that a few times during this process if possible. It basically makes them associate the other cats scent with something good like food. 

Now this part not everybody has but once you do that you are supposed to put them in a more neutral territory but not everybody has that. Maybe your kitchen or something could be if none of the cats claimed it as theirs and you can also wipe the kitchen down and stuff so there isn’t really any cat scent in the kitchen. 

The thing with cats is you shouldn’t let them fight cause once they start fighting they will start associating the cat that they fought with bad negative memories which leads to more fighting. 


So basically for now on regardless if you try reintroducing them or not whenever you leave the home or are sleeping or whatever you are doing where you can’t watch them separate them so they can’t get to each other. Whenever you are near them and they look like they are going to fight stop it, cats don’t always just attack right away they may have a conversation even if it’s just with body language. If you are scared to put your hands near them when they are about to fight or are fighting try making a very loud noise. Maybe get a kitchen pot and a stick and bang it which can stop them cause it startles them and makes them run away. 


I know there is somebody on YouTube who made a video about introducing cats but I forgot his name. 
If you look up on YouTube how to introduce cats you’ll probably find the person I’m talking about since he is pretty well known for cat training and stuff. 

Hope you and your cats work this out!"
Pets,fiuwlye,t3_f9un6t,1582749598.0,"Just keep being nice to the dog honestly. I read your other comments and if the dog does have history of abuse maybe they just don’t trust people that easily especially when their trusted owner that protects them isn’t there. Just keep showing them that you won’t hurt them. Also since the dog decided to hide in the closet it’s best to not go up to the closet cause the dog may feel cornered if you do, if you want to go up and try to give him a treat make sure there is definitely enough space in his opinion to run away if he feels the need to. Idk what kind of closet it is though so you might not be able to. Maybe just sit down somewhere all calm and don’t bother them that much besides leaving treats wherever for him to get. Every hour or so try again asking him if he wants to go for a walk. Sucks that he won’t let you walk him 🤷‍♀️ he will probably end up going on the floor tbh"

Also for driving on ice and snow we don’t learn that obviously but it rains very much in Florida where I live and we have to know how to drive on that and it’s fairly similar.
changemyview,fhuvhg0,t3_f4v673,1581890574.0,"I know a lot of people have already commented on this but I just want to put my perspective in. 
Okay so I live in Florida currently, there is no parallel parking in our driving test, the reason really being is that we like never use it. The specific area that I live in parallel parking isn’t a thing unless you go to the beach and even than it’s only like 10 percent of the parking spots honestly so unless you work on the beach you are probably never going to use it. So I think it’s correct that we don’t have to get tested on it since we don’t use it at all. It would be pointless. 


Now where I’m from New York is a different story. It’s way more common in New York to have parallel parking. 
Obviously there are some areas that don’t really have it but it’s pretty common and even if you don’t live where there is you are more than likely going to always go somewhere where there is if you go to maybe the store or you know anywhere. So in New York they should have it on the test. 



My point is that it should definitely be on the test if it’s common in the area but if it’s not common than there isn’t a need for it. 
I do think that the reasoning to get rid of it because cars basically do it for you is stupid. The newest model of car my family owns is a 2010 out of 4 cars. The second newest is legit a 2001. Im 18 and most of my friends who are the same age as me don’t have new cars that can do that, we all have older model cars so unless you got money to buy a new model car that’s not gonna be good. 

Also I don’t exactly think driving tests should be harder because I know a lot of people who already struggle to pass their driving test. I do think though that once you are maybe 65 or something that you should have to retake it though. So many accidents are caused by older people for multiple reasons."

Aquariums,fg5wkn2,t1_fg5w4zo,1580541925.0,Right now I just run the container of water to my bathtub. I’m assuming it would be in my best interest to get a large bucket and than throw the nastiness outside lol which I can do
Aquariums,fg5vzz1,t1_fg5vqlj,1580541203.0,"When I need to do water changes I honestly get any container in my house that is clean and take the water out with it. If I need to clean any gravel I clean the gravel with my hands (I’m getting a gravel vacuum soon though.) My turtle tank has sand so that just stays in there till I have to replace. 
I’m ashamed by this lol sorry."

RATS,fdltdgg,t3_em21pk,1578532035.0,"You could try to rat proof the room you play with them in? Basically cover up any areas they can get “lost” in so they can’t go in there. 
I have two boys and one of them likes cuddling and stuff but my other one is the opposite and likes to dart away and run around and get into trouble lol"

PetMice,fcoe9cz,t1_fcodbvd,1577830118.0,Happy new year to you also
PetMice,fcod7e7,t1_fcod6f8,1577829368.0,Okay thank you
PetMice,fcod15a,t1_fcocydh,1577829248.0,Do you think it will be fine for now till I can get new bedding
PetMice,fcm9iwj,t1_fcm8ecw,1577767897.0,"Honestly I can’t tell you how much, it’s different everywhere and with every vet, the best thing I can tell you is to call a few vets that take in mice and see what they say🤷‍♀️ I’ve seen people say 20, I had to pay 47 for a normal checkup, and I’ve seen people say more like it really Varys. 

And about that cage.
The cage doesn’t have enough floor space, male mice need about a minimum of 360 square inches of unbroken floor space. Which would be a 20 gallon tank I’m pretty sure. Those cages are too small and they don’t like it at all. Also with those cages there is like no room to give them everything to make them happy like a suitable size wheel, hides, toys, and anything else they want. I have a 30 gallon tank for my male and I still want more room to put more things in there for him. 

Those cages also don’t allow you too put enough bedding in there. Mice are burrowers and need atleast 2 inches of bedding to burrow and make suitable tunnels, and 2 inches of bedding is minimum and in my opinion you should have more than 2 inches. 

Also if you have the extensions those cages sell like the tubes and stuff they can get stuck in them and suffocate, they just aren’t safe honestly. 

Also if you are using the wheel that they sell with that cage is not big enough, it makes their backs bend which hurts their spine, I have a ten inch wheel for my male mouse and for my female mice I have large saucer wheels. 

There could be more that I can’t think of right now but yah..

And no problem, I like helping people out if I can"
PetMice,fcm82ij,t3_ehxoiu,1577766713.0,"Take him to the vet, since you don’t know what happened. It looks like he hurt himself somehow? Maybe he fell or got stuck somewhere🤷‍♀️ not really sure but it looks like something a vet should see honestly. Until you can take him to the vet and stuff basically make it very easy to get to his food, water, and whatever else like that that he needs. If you have the extensions /tubes for that cage I advise take them off probably so he can’t go get stuck in them or something cause that happens. 
Also that cage is not suitable. You can make a bin cage for pretty cheap you just have to basically diy a little, there are multiple YouTube videos on it, or just buy a tank(I use tanks for my mice) I usually find tanks off of Facebook market place or like Craigslist for pretty cheap. I have my male in a 30 gallon tank but I think you can have them in smaller. 
Those cages are just not suitable for multiple reasons. 
If you want more tips to his care or have any questions you can message me and I’ll be happy to answer anything that I can or you can check out Emiology on YouTube, she has a lot of good videos about mice care and stuff."
PetMice,fckmdtg,t1_fckm095,1577728472.0,"Okay, Thank you for the help!"
PetMice,fckjkg7,t1_fckjf0z,1577726733.0,Okay thank you I’ll try those 🙌 I was thinking of buying some fleece stuff for their tank anyways
PetMice,fckhu53,t1_fckdysd,1577725658.0,"I could try a heat mat/ electric blanket. They are in a tank(I only use tanks) 

I’ll check the window they are near and stuff, if I just have to caulk the window I can(my dad is the maintenance manager at the apartment complex I live in so I can get any tools and supplies to fix anything) 


Also I could potentially move the tank but I would like to try not to do that."

RATS,fcaowhd,t3_egwkz3,1577573627.0,People have put their scent on paper towels and put the paper towels in the cage 🤷‍♀️ I’m not sure why that one is biting you but maybe they just need more time to get used to you🤷‍♀️ they could also be food happy basically and think your finger is food for a second. One of my rats sometimes mistakes my acrylic nails as food🤣I don’t remember how to stop them from biting your finger though if they think it’s food.
RATS,fcaobth,t1_fcagawg,1577573269.0,You could make another post on reddit of the photo and just comment the link of that post here 🤷‍♀️ I usually see people do it that way.
