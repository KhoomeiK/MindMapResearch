I was just involved in a discord clan split because all of the people in charge were males 30+ and we found out had been “flirty” with a few of the women who were absolutely not comfortable with it and made it known they weren’t comfortable. Sadly this only came out due to the realization the women had no real say or lower there. 

In the end, it came down to almost the entire server joining us in a new gang, with sexual harassment being included in the things that will not be tolerated in the new rules. All of the women from the old gang joined. If you join a clan or gang or discord and see no evidence of women holding any position of power or respect, run as fast as you can."

I live in Denmark (a country of roughly 5.5 million) and we have so far had a total of 553 deaths. The high point here was about April 1st and has steadily gone down since then. We are around 200 patients in the hospital right now for it and most will recover. 

Again, we have 5.5 million people. I am so sorry to see the death toll is so high in America (I am an expat). I can’t even blame most Americans for freaking out and needing to go back to work, as the lack of support system means work or lose their homes, cars or even not be able to afford groceries. 

The one thing I don’t get though, is how quick everyone is to open up again. I do hope that 10,000 families that lose someone they love, includes what will happen in hastily open the county, the state and America as a whole back up."

That wish of just being dead because it seems easier and there is no hope for a better future. It sucks that’s how you’re feeling and it’s so hard to go through. But you’re doing it. You can do it because I bet you’ve been through this many times before.

I was literally just talking with my husband this morning while we walked the dog about how weird it is to be stable. Like to be neutral and how unnatural it can feel. I am rapid cycling bipolar 2 and don’t particularly consider myself very high functioning. At least not compared to how I want to be. Life is so much less... vivid when I am well medicated and taking care of myself. It can even seem down right boring at times. 

But apparently that’s what it’s like for most people. You will have to make the decision for yourself what you are and aren’t willing to live with. I am not particularly heavily medicated but what I am on (550mg lamotrigine plus 3-6mg melatonin but just for a couple of months until I can establish a better sleep routine/habit). It works well for me. Quiets my brain. Makes the bad not so bad and the hypomania less likely to get out of control. 

The meds in no way make me feel cured or even high functioning really but they make the difference of me wanting to go have sex with a stranger and *actually* doing it. The difference between wanting to die to *actively* trying to kill myself. 

I am sending you all the best wishes. All the extra strength I have to give and all my confidence in your ability to come out the other side of this stronger and with more hope than when you walked into it."

He is also there to help me figure out if my meds are helping and if not help me as much as he can or give me as much support as I need to go to my doctor. My doctors are highly encouraging to bring him along when needed so they can hear an outside opinion. 

It’s really important though that if you know you have anger issues OP or become really unreasonable at time, that you work in those things. I can also be really mean when hypomanic. Like evil.
