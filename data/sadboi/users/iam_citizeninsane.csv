thesopranos,fojwha0,t1_fojv0p3,1587830806.0,"Okay. All I’m saying is that when young people learn new philosophies that may seem disturbing to their traditional parents, that is *not* indicative of being troubled. It also shows more of the parents’ ignorance to automatically take offense to that statement while knowing nothing about it. 

I’m not saying he wasn’t troubled. I just don’t think him being interested in new ideas like that was like, a sign of how messed up he was. For me, AJ’s problems showed up the most in scenes like him cheating in school because he never developed any work ethic. He became totally disillusioned with the world in the end because he never learned how to actually participate in it. He felt the world had nothing to offer him so what’s the point? But a huge part of that is not ever really being taught how to make something of himself. His parents didn’t set the best example. Unless a kid is naturally strong willed like Meadow, they need to be led in the right direction and given a roadmap to help them grow. I feel like he didn’t really have that and he needed it the most."
thesopranos,fojuplv,t1_fojjm6l,1587829778.0,"I mean... him reading 19th century philosophers in school and then parroting the ideas wasn’t a sign he needed help. I’m sorry but if you honestly think saying “God is dead” is that big of a deal then you’re missing the point. It wasn’t a sign he was a troubled kid. He was learning new ideas and trying to understand them. 

He did have issues to be sure. I just don’t think that particular scene was meant to show how “troubled” he was. It was more funny than anything else honestly. Also it showed the hypocrisy of Tony and Carmela urging AJ to be a “good catholic” when it’s obvious they don’t abide by the same rules nor do they really even understand the importance of religion.
