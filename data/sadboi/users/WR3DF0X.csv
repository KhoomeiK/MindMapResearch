You attract how you feel towards others and you must figure out why you are this way. You have to accept the way people behave is mostly because of their own doing and in accepting this you can start to walk the path of Buddha.

Why have we been given life? Is to leave a mark not to be enjoyable? Is overcoming limitations not to be enjoyable? You speak with such pain as if you are trapped but you are free to choose what happens from your actions. 

Drop the guard and use experience to guide you to better results. You must grow to appreciate all levels of being. Suffering and struggles are just lower levels of consciousness. I know you are hurting and do not wish to live your entire life as you perceive it to be but to overcome this hurt will be like feeling things you did not know were possible. You are currently too hard on yourself and others and you must find it within you to forgive and accept the way things can be sometimes. Life has many peaks too if you go searching for them.

You have a long way to go before you can see the way Buddha sees.

Love thy self and learn to Love all that is. Take your own words - ""Life is about overcoming your limitations..""   
and let down your guard my friend and continue to grow.

Failing all this re-watch the Star Wars franchise!"
