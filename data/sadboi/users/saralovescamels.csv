rpghorrorstories,fcupdbf,t1_fctc1ns,1577985826.0,"Right! I played a game once with some family members and their friends and the DM wrote a whole sex dungeon into the game and put characters through various sexual torture acts in detail etc.. All kinds of awkward and weird especially when it's your family members sitting there with you. The DM was way too into it and ruined the game for all of us, we met once more after that but it was too weird and never finished his campaign."

My manager came to the funeral and reminded me that I would need to call in for those days and that I was still on the schedule. At my store there has been some people since then that get 5 bereavement days without using pto, I guess it depends on how much management likes you as well."

ptsd,f1kywzk,t3_d9ial5,1569542982.0,"I missed a lot in high school. Sometimes it was bad enough that I got a legit medical leave for a few weeks. Mine is c-ptsd so I have more recent things like the death of my Mom that I struggle with at work now. I have called in a few times because I can't stand being around the majority of people when I'm having flashbacks of her in the process of passing away and seeing her after her death. Holiday stuff and Mother's Day things still bother me a lot, I usually call in the most during those times."

ptsd,f0pqloq,t1_f0o423p,1568843357.0,"Yes, and not just with partners but with friends, family, etc.. People will try to walk all over your boundaries but try your best to maintain them so you can have at least a little bit of inner peace. If someone cant accept your boundaries that you are using to keep yourself safe and heal then they will never respect you as a person in any other way."
ptsd,f0pqi38,t3_d5t7g1,1568843188.0,It is very difficult and scary. Just finding someone you like is hard enough because little things about so many people can remind you of your abusers. I was single for many years before I found someone I was comfortable with but I was never able to tell them all the things I had been through out of fear they would leave. Feeling safe with a person and feeling vulnerable at the same time feels like a war inside you at times.
ptsd,f0pqc6x,t3_d60zug,1568842912.0,"Yes, I've been told by many people that I'm weak or pathetic on my days that I struggle. I keep everything bottled up inside and some days something will trigger a memory at work and I will break down and cry while I'm working. I never stop working, I still get my job done the right way and on time even if I have tears pouring down my face. I'm not a loud or aggressive person so I often get told I need to just act stronger, get a tougher skin, or stop being so weak. It really takes the cake when someone says something innapropriate and causes me to have flashbacks then I get called the weak one so they don't have to accept the fact they are a shitty person."
ptsd,f0pq0dr,t3_d5katw,1568842362.0,I do this too if I see anyone who resembles any of the people who harmed me in any way.
ptsd,ezpudfr,t3_d1sam3,1568048756.0,I have had these issues since childhood as well. It wasn't until I was older that I also found out anxiety and ptsd were probably why I felt so bad while I was growing up. I wish adults had taken those things seriously back then instead of telling us we were faking it when we knew we felt awful.

I don't like being along my fence when my neighbors are outside but I plan on planting some bushes to block myself from having to see them when I'm outside. I do avoid people that I know will be triggers for me as well."

walmart,ey27t8h,t1_ey1lxig,1566729146.0,We had to switch back to the normal bags Friday for a few hours to finish out picking. We don't have full staff and we still had over 800 picks at 2 o clock. They obviously did not think of the pickers and how much opening and dealing with those bags slows us down. We have been getting surveys from customers that love the bags though and that scares me.
walmart,extjcmp,t1_ext65pd,1566569825.0,They are stronger than the normal bags but hanging them is where we have a problem. We put a bunch of bags in one bag and hang it on the hook where we hang the normal bags. But since you have to stop and open each bag one at a time instead of having one hanging ready like the old bags it's slowing us down so much.
walmart,exswdr9,t3_cucav8,1566558278.0,"My store is one of three in our state that was chosen to test these bags out. Anyone else have to deal with these yet? They've been a pain for us so far. I'm curious how other stores have felt about them, any tips for setting them up on the carts, etc.?"

ASM told me I would have to leave the dept unless my availability was completely open 24/7. One of my friends that is full time but had 2 days a week blocked off was moved from OGP to cap 1. I'm hoping our schedules won't get worse than they already are but I feel it will. We start home delivery this month so we need to be keeping people that are already trained to pick not putting them in other areas of the store and bringing in replacements.

ptsd,evhmfua,t3_cjw26c,1564528706.0,Yelling affects me too. At work today there was a fight in the store with 2 men yelling and cussing each other and one of them punched a woman. The yelling and fighting made me instantly panic even though I was far enough away that they couldnt touch me. My chest still hurts even though I've been home a couple hours. I usually use melatonin and cbd so I can try to relax and sleep after being triggered by yelling or aggressive people.

ptsd,esf4jae,t3_c7fqs8,1561916920.0,Very true. I work in retail and one of the hardest things for me since watching my Mom slowly pass away due to illness is hearing little kids yell the word 'mommy' or 'mom' in the store. My eyes literally well up with tears.
selfcare,esf2wy1,t3_c3kpiv,1561915812.0,"I like keeping small squishies around, when my anxiety acts up they help me calm down sometimes. I keep one by my bed and one in a zippered pouch I carry in my purse as an anxiety/stress kit.

Sometimes I add small trinkets into the kit like small Disney figures or some cool dice to look at to take my mind off things.

I have 2 aromatherapy inhalers, cbd oil, and a vape mod that I use the cbd in that I also keep in the pouch.

A small bottle of good lotion, especially if it contains lavender or vitamins for our skin is good to carry around.  

Don't be afraid to keep anything close to you that gives you comfort. I literally held onto a stuffed animal ewok like a baby the day I took my exit exam from college and snuck in a pencil pouch that had Disney tsum tsums in it while I took my exam. I managed to get the 2nd highest score in my class despite how scared I was."
