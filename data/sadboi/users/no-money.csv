AskReddit,foo3p7w,t1_fonr987,1587931888.0,"Im only in my early 20s but I think intelligence is kind of inherent in people my age. I’ve had a lot of messed up life experiences and read about anything that catches my interests. It makes things difficult when women I meet are uncultured, or rather still immature in the sense they don’t know about the realities of life and what’s going on besides social media. I’m failing school but that doesn’t mean i’m not intelligent. As you age i believe attractiveness is a good quality but not a defining factor, but i find the most intelligent people around your age are the ones who keep an open mind and can relate to people’s experiences. Often times this directly correlates with a sense of humor as you can usually differentiate between a witty remark or dad joke vs a sarcastic remark based off of the topic, persons tone and expressions. I’ve been with my fair share of people attractive and not, id marry the girl who is understanding, caring, and knowledgeable over a pretty face, attractiveness fades but personalities often don’t. I hope this helped clear things up a little and hope you find somebody! I’m always open for conversation I can talk about anything for the most part <3

for example, if you were to reply, “holy fuck marry me”, rather than “thank you for clarifying” that shows a sense of humor which most guys will low-key pick up on right off the bat! This is a hard topic though and people will react differently but for the most part we don’t like when we make a joke and your partner just gets angry or just sits there with the “wtf” face. Lastly, I don’t mean a backhanded joke or insult just a remark about something we were watching or experience! Sense of humor varies but it is easy tell tell if someone is serious all the time and doesn’t joke around like that."
