Having a dissociative disorder like this takes time to figure out.

Don‚Äôt be too nervous. What comforted me most (I‚Äôm not a host but I had to find out the hard way I‚Äôm an alter) is knowing that there was no Before. If you are in a dissociated system of alters, there was never a time when you weren‚Äôt dissociated.
