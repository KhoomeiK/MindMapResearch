No considerable change in my life or myself, feel much the same as I did just after I stopped smoking. I also have some underlying issues though which come into play with the whole giving up weed so I need to work on other areas of my life but giving up was defo massive achievement! 

Congrats man keep it up"

The financial side of it was terrible, I felt guilty getting money out the bank to then go pick up. Deep down I wasn’t actually enjoying it, it was an addiction and a habit something that my body craved so I would fulfil that craving by continuing the shitty viscous  circle my life was. I was selfish and put weed the no.1 thing in my life not my family, relationships or work. It made me very angry and irritable if I didn’t have it etc. There are many reasons."
leaves,f0by92j,t1_f0b2w6f,1568533350.0,Yeah I appreciate what your saying man. But I do excercuse I cycle an average of 40 miles a week and have a physical job 35 hours a week. I also surf. It really isn’t the exercise. Believe me I’ve really tried with the positive changes and positive attitude and I’ve put in a lot of work. I’ve not just quit and expected a huge change because I already know quitting is one thing and getting your life back is another.

leaves,es0r6ol,t3_c51yid,1561481426.0,I finally had enough of consciously knowing for about a year that I was addicted and that my body screamed at me for it and my life was just a cycle of work... get home... go to my guy to pick up... come home and smoke. Everyday until I was sick of it. My whole life evolved around it.

AskReddit,eqon10i,t3_bz14en,1560190416.0,"Last night my cat brought in a rabbit that he paralysed. I could only think the best thing for him was to end the suffering and put it out of its misery. I have never had to put an animal out of its misery before so was quite anxious and didn’t know how to go about it. Anyway there is a sign post up my lane ( we live in a rural village, not a town. Nobody around) and I decided to swing and smash its head into the pole, the first time I chickened out and missed at the last moment and he came out my hands and I had basically threw him. I felt terrible. The second time It made contact and blood was coming out of its nose. But he was still alive. the 3rd hit caused it to break its back and start fitting profusely and I was standing there completely in shock as to what I was doing, I felt so devastated and cruel. I was standing there traumatised with this quivering animal in my hand not knowing what an earth I was doing. I decided just to give it one final hit and swung it into the bar and then it completely started fitting violently so I put it in the hedge and walked off thinking that it would die of shock. I felt absolutely shocked and helpless and that I had just done something totally messed up. I was on the verge of crying. Later on that night I went back and fortunately it was dead so made me feel a tiny bit better but nonetheless I still feel totally sickened and guilty that I’ve done this and wish it could of gone much more smoothly. Has anyone got any advice or have ever done something that’s made them feel ashamed and sick to the bone afterwards."
