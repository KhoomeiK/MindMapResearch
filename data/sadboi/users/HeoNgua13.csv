I appeared to be happy and active person. I'm funny and always positive. But when i'm in privated zone, i remember everything people said, even their compliment or a little advice is hurting me. I drink everyday and lie to my bestie that i already quit. Every morning wake up with a wish that i could be ""body physically"" sick so i could stop thinking for a while. I want my brain to rest. My brain now is actually killing me. sometimes i wish i should not be borned. Wake up every day, look in the mirror and keep saying that ""you have everything, don't think too much, don't upset yourself and be happy"""
