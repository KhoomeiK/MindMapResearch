interestingasfuck,fr4ha28,t1_fr2y09i,1589888167.0,"This John Oliver came into existance trough an unforuntate mishap with a time machine. 

Middle aged John Oliver travelled back in time and prevented his younger self from ever getting bangs, to spare him the public humiliation and jokes. However, as time unfolded he realized why every young timetraveller is taught not to interact with past versions of themselves: young John Oliver, being convinced that his future self must be right (he was, after all, from the future) decided to go to a good hairdresser and found his style much earlier than the future version of him had. He never learned to be make self-deprecating jokes, and thus failed in his efforts of becoming a late night show host. This set him on a different path, that would lead to him never being able to afford travelling back in time. This would however cause him to get a horrible haircut in the past, which in turn would make him rich enough to get a timemachine. This paradox caused a split in time, and henceforth two John Olivers existed: The one with the bad haircut in his youth, who lived a happy and prosperous life as a host of a popular late night show, and the one we see here, who was told by a future version of himself to never get bangs. He lived a mediocre life, always reminded of his own shortcomings by the knowledge of another, more successful version of himself, but with high self esteem and pride based on his attractive haircut. The stress of this constant conflict caused him to suffer a severe burnout and midlife crisis, which turned his hair grey. In his despair, John Oliver decided to rebel against the one commandment he had followed all his life, and cut himself bangs. This caused him to find peace, and he lives on happily as a creator of sandsculptures, wearing his ridiculous haircut with pride.

knitting,fqntgrp,t1_fqldxb8,1589501079.0,"Ok so,it is not THAT different in my opinion,Wearing something that shows some cleavage or posting a picture of that same thing literally shows off the exact same amount of cleavage and skin. However I do agree that the first one is percieved differently, and as I said I am aware that my cleavage in pictures can seem different. 

But then I have to dissagree: We are not talking about semi-naked bodies here. We are talking about some cleavage and maybe depending on the picture a little midriff. And that is it. The photos are NOT made for the reason of showing off boobs, but for the reason of showing off knitting, and I honestly don‘t believe that anyone would seriously confuse the two. I personally would not mind being caught with pictures of knit bralettes in public because again, not semi naked, and also very very easy to explain, it is literally the knitting subreddit. Like I said, I personally have no problem with tagging pictures that include my cleavage nsfw, but I strongly disagree with the „there should be less boobs“ notion. I will also not let anyone put an „inappropirate“ tag on my body. I think a good rule of thumb would also be: if you are in a place where you can not explain tha this is a harmless knitting subreddit which happened to have a picture of a woman in a bralette on it, it is probably not a place where it is appropriate to use reddit anyways? 

I do not get what you are trying to say with your last paragraph: you do not want your imaginary younger brother to have too many pictures of naked women? Um, ok. So are you trying to say „there should not be naked women on reddit, so he can‘t build his feed this way?“ because honestly, that is on him then. Do not apologize a guy/boys creepy behaviour with the availability of naked women. It is literally the internet, actual naked people and porn is available on any corner. If he is not old/mature enough to healthily deal with that, he should not bw allowed on reddit. This also has zero relevance to this discussion because, again, we are not talking about women who are half naked, let alone in lingerie or naked. Your imaginary younger brother going to look at the knitting subreddit for the boobs is... not very likely. Many things are oversexualized, just look at adverts. But the knittinv subreddit really is not one of those places."

If she really is doing meth she should not be allowed to even keep her kids. But I don‘t know if she is, and neither does the average commenter here (do you actually know her? Where are those meth facts coming from?). But she is being called trashy just for having her kids see her on a pole, which I strongly disagreee with. So I am defending the part which I see.

trashy,fql4rv5,t1_fqeuc4p,1589446222.0,"In my opinion (I have not seen the video though) this woman is not recording herself for facebook our of „ulterior motives“. She is wearing a normal pole outfit, and is recording her routine/tricks/whatever it is, to show off her skills or get feedback in a poledancing facebook group, or just showing her friends what she can do. I don‘t think this is trashy or innapropriate. Most people seem to have this kind of idea that „gymnastics are ok but you can‘t flaunt yourself“ which makes no sense. You have to wear a bikini top or bootyshorts and a sportsbra or somethink like it because otherwise you can‘t hold yourself up. People who have never done this have no idea how incredibly hard this sport is, and it‘s very easy to say „oh she‘s stripping“ when in fact she is actually doing a crazy intense workout."
trashy,fql4fyz,t1_fqgm1ud,1589445891.0,"Ok so. I have an at home pole, aand I also go to a polestudio to work out. 

I honestly don‘t really know what you mean when you say „she isn‘t doing it for gymnastics“. I am biased of course (as are you, just differently), but I don‘t really get what you are talking about there. Do you think she is somehow abusing her kid by letting it watch her work out? 



Because there are a few things I do know, that are maybe not easy to understand if you have never beeninterested in poleing. First of all, her outfit: as you said, it does look like it is some sort of lingerie/bikini type bottom. And that actually really is what we wear. You suggested bootyshorts, and in this particular position, any bootyshorts that would not be somewhat restrictive would probably also cover a similar portion of her butt. Poledancing completely relies on being able to hold yourself up, and that only works if you have your skin directly on the pole. We‘re not all wearing bikini bottoms and sportsbras because we‘re just all exhibitionists or because of the „sexual nature“ of poledancing, it‘s literally necessary to not slip down. Is wearing a lacey poleoutfit in front of your kids inappropriate? It depends. In my personal opinion it‘s really hard to make those kind of blanket statements. Some families have a more open and relaxed attitude towards this kind of thing, which I personally prefer, in my opinion it‘s much harder to grow up in a place where there is a lot of stigma around. 



The second thing is that we are not just claiming that this is a sport. That’s not an argument, it’s just the plain truth. Have youever tried holding yourself off the ground only by whatever parts of you are touching a metal pole? It‘s the most intense workout I have ever done in my entire life, and I used to do HIIT (high intensity interval training) which is no cakewalk either. It takes an insane amount of muscle and flexibility and a really high pain tolerance to be able to do this. This is a workout, period. It can obviously be done in a sexual nature, but first and foremost it is a sport, just like any type of dance is (and almost any kind of dance can be sexualized too). 
I dont think a woman would usually do a sexualized pole routine while her kid is around, and from seeing just these pictures the only thing we can tell is that she is working out. 


You are arguing based on the ver problematic stereotype that all poledancers are strippers, and that poledancing women should either only do this for the pleasure of their man or are just straight up whores. I hope I do not need to tell you that that is complete bullsh*t."

I dissagree, in the sense that all the pictures I see are people either showing their awesome work, or being happy about how something fits them (which can also be a big deal. The ripple bralette I made for myself took four tries to get it to fit me, and it is the first bralette I have ever been able to wear aince I was a teen). So I guess I just have a very different way of looking at it, I dont see someone showing off their boobs, or catering to the „male gaze“, I see a woman proud of her accomplishments. And I love seeing that, in all it‘s forms. When I wear sth lowcut, I dont do it for people to look at me. I do it bc I enjoy myself. And the same goes for pictures here, I show off the thing I made, that fit‘s like a glove, and I am happy about that."
knitting,fqhl42i,t1_fqhi7bj,1589379174.0,"I have to say I agree with both sides here. It makes perfect sense to me that some people might not like to be caught with a picture of a woman in a bralette on their... let’s say library computerscreen, but at the same time I could literally wear that very same bralette to an actual library and nobody would bat an eye. It is not intended to be bodyshaming, or about a specific person, but it does have that kind of effect. I have biiig boobs, so pictures that in some way include my cleavage always have that kind of nsfw touch, no matter what I do. Someone with a different body might not have that „problem“, so the use of the nsfw-tag for specific types of cleavage is always kinda difficult. I also think that it is really really hard to draw a line. Where does it start being „too much“? What is still appropriate to be posted in a sfw sub? If I knit a bikini top, can I post it? It‘s difficult. And I think that is why we have the nsfw tag, and to me that is no problem, I have no issue tagging myself nsfw, bc I am aware that pictures of my body might leave an unwanted kind of impression. 

However I don‘t like the general idea of „there are too many boobs“, especially because like 90 percent of boobs we see int this sub are quite fully covered up with sweaters and tops, so it makes me wonder... It reminds me of how in school we were not allowed to wear stuff that was too tight over our boobs, which to me is massively problematic because it makes it seem like there is something wrong with having boobs.

I totally respect that this is your opinion, but from my point of view this sub has very few boobs. 
I posted a ripple bralette a few weeks back, and I actually marked my post nswf because it did show cleavage, and the rules tell us to be „conservative“ with marking nsfw. But in my opinion this is not „showing off boobs“. This is just how my body is, and what it looks like when I wear certain clothes. I marked it nsfw to be safe, but I wear it outdoors, and it’s just plain normal to me. I have not seen a single post on this sub that I would say is inappropriately showing off boobs.

I do not care if I see the same thing over and over (btw, it‘s not just the ripple bralette. It‘s also „look I knit my first thing!“. It‘s certain sweater patterns. The list goes on). I love seeing beautiful work, and being inspired by people. I see ripple bralettes in tons of different colorways, and I honestly like it:) I get excited over sth pretty and knit, no matter how often I have seen it before, because every single one of them is unique.

Their cause is amazing, apart from taking care of mustangs and trying to keep them together with their original family bands, they are trying to protect the rest of the actually wild mustangs from being rounded up and sent to slaughter (yea, that really happens.

And then I ask him to speed up while keeping that tension. Some horses have more of a predisposition towards tolt, so they might actually offer to tölt and find more difficult to trot with a decent rhythm. They usually need a lot less collecting, but are hard to work in trot because they fall into tölt quite easily. Others have more of a „trot-disposition“.

People love it, they think it‘s so sweet I knit them something. Little do they know it‘s not just about giving them something but actually just about wanting to knit shawls and stuff."

knitting,fq0c2by,t3_gg9ima,1589029874.0,"I leaned the basics in school, but reading patterns I learned (and still learn) with the help of youtube. If it says sth like „CO5“ and I dont know/forgot what that means, I just go check in the „abbreviations“ part of the pattern. There it says „CO=cast on“ and then I google it, with some specifices (for example „casting on underarm stitches sweater“) and then I always find a tutorial to help me:)"

knitting,fq09r8e,t3_ggeno4,1589029185.0,"Hi:) yes, you „purl backwards“. So: slip, turn, ans then purl 4, so purl the one you just slipped (and yes, pretty backwards just like you said. After that your yarn is where it should be , and you can puls three additional stitches:) so in your picture, get slip that first stitch back onto your left needle, and then p4 (uncluding the weird backwards kind of first purl stitch). The weird purl stitch is a bit awkward at first but after a while it gets really easy:)
Hope that helps:)"
