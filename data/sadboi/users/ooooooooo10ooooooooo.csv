It sounds to me like you are the only one cleaning up after all the cats, if so that isn't fair to you and doesn't sound like your boyfriend is willing to compromise.  If you can, I'd move out stay GF/BF but set boundaries that if there was ever a chance of you two living together he'd have to demonstrate he could care for himself and the cats by cleaning up after them.
