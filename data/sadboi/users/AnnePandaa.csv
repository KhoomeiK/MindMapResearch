Unless I have this obsession with someone I somehow choose to make an impossible illusion about. And the people I ""choose"" to do this with, are never people I can actually have.

Every mental diagnosis is a social construct, just look at how we add more and more to the list. They weren't ""a thing"" before someone chose to make them a thing. In parts of the world, depression is not a thing either. 

Especially with depression though, my opinion is, that unless it's severe or close to being severe, we should stop seeing this as a mental disorder but instead as part of life. But oh well, overall I'm not a fan of the diagnostic systems. ICD and DSM doesn't even agree on plenty of the disorders, this being one reason why to me every disorder is a social construct, that isn't even universal, and also one reason, why I'm not positive about diagnoses themselves"

Neuropsychology,eq9ox9k,t1_eq9lh5v,1559914016.0," I disagree due to plenty article I have read. The simple fact that trust often have an effect on how well a therapy works to me indicate that ""willpower"" can change way more than we think. The fact that placebo is s thing is the same. And actually a lot of studies shows that wanting to change is indeed a huge factor in the change your are able to do. 

Sure there's a difference between change in a not damaged brain and change in a damaged brain. Just like we can't cure cancer with willpower we cannot gain our sight back if our visual cortex is fucked. But I do believe that rehabilitation after brain damage works better if you have willpower for it. Meditation also have the opportunity to change your brain and e.g. reduce stress. From my view out minds hold way more power than we want to aknowledge.

But I guess it's down to how we define willpower."
