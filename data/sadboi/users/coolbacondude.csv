The world comprises of multiple cities and countries. If you're going to base it on only America, of course you won't find much fucking results and if you look at the statistics now, you will find that the number of cases are increasing day by day. Through prediction which you can't do, it can cause a shit ton of deaths. A virus that can kill and is highly infectious will no doubt make peoplr worry and since there's no cure or vaccine as of now, we can only rely on the immune system which old, young and people that has problems with their immune system can't as it's weaker. Have you even seen Italy? The number of cases shot up overnight ffs."

singapore,f5wlryd,t3_dpihqn,1572526440.0,"Teacher told the class that his ex student brought a knife intending to kill people bullying him then take his own life. Someone tipped a teacher and he was stopped before he could do anything.

Someone took a shit in the 2nd floor cubicle and I think didn't have enough toilet paper so (toilet paper is provided outside the toilet so if not enough you need a savior or you die) the next thought was to paint the toilet stall. Toilet was closed until school reopened.

Last year, a classmate took out a lighter and a deodorant can and made a makeshift flamethrower at the back of the class. I saw the whole thing. Teacher noticed and he was sent to our year head I think. He's still in school but may retain this year. (If he does, it's his second year)

This happened this year. Student was hit by a motorcycle after grabbing a lunch. Some of you may know this and no, he wasn't jaywalking. There was a path for him to cross and a sign states ""Pedestrians crossing"" even hought there's a traffic light a minute walk away. He's fine now.

This isn't fucked up but it's super funny. A friend of mine threw an eraser at the teacher from the back. He didn't intend to hit the teacher but he hit her and the DM came in, threw the eraser at him a couple of times and some disciplinary actions were done after school. It wasn't harsh, an apology letter and some detention I think."
