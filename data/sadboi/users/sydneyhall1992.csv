That thought use to make me so happy because I believed one day I wake up and be like everyone else. It was around 5th grade I started to realize that was never going to happen. Took me until adulthood to understand that people should have told me you find ways to cope with it and it will eventually get easier ...

I know its not really advice but maybe save the kid a little heartache"

Spell check sucks, I'll spell check then I have to plug the word into google to look up the definition just make sure its the right word. Make spell check recognize how word sound instead of how many similar letters there are with a completely different word ..idk

or maybe the drop down menu for spellcheck can have brief definition behind the words."

BPDlovedones,ew1o9zg,t3_cm8odf,1565027756.0,"ok I'm going respectfully disagree with the tone of this video mostly because he speaks in absolutes.

I'm someone who was raised by a BP, has a younger brother who BP and is currently living with a roommate who is BP (its been real fun guys.....)

and id say the 2 out of 3, in my personal experience, what he is saying is spot on. They are grown-ass-man-children with zero control over their emotions and it always 100% anybody's fault but their own.

Its incredibly frustrating 

however what I think we should all recognized BP is not a set-in-stone personality type and just like anxiety or depression is can be managed.

it really depends on the individual, how high functioning they are, how much they REALLY want to change.  

maybe the basic nature of BP just inherently makes raising above it that much more difficult vs other mental issues, but call me hopeful, I think it is possible or at least possible for some."

I need to be prepared that he might want a romantic relationship with someone else. 
Which he has done in the past.
I know I'll survive.

its a """"fun"""" duality to juggle; fairly positive he value the friendship on some level but I have to keep in mind the very real possibility I'm being used."

no passed attempt that i'm aware of  but he says stuff like;

""I'm to scare to attempt suicide because if I do and mess up then everyone will know and be up all in business, plus I might be permanently disfigured, id' have to be sure to aim that bullet right in the center of my brain and get it right the first time""

if I push on the issue, he just says he joking and tells me not to worried he'd never actually do it, he wouldn't do that to me.

but he's BP so like what if he's having a moment and this moment he for whatever reason thinks I don't care or that anyone cares

I know he has a gun, idk if he has bullets though, maybe I should do something about that? I just don't know how to bring it up cus fucking A those BP mood swing suck and he can turn abusive real quick.

\*side note\* he is in therapy, and has officially been diagnosed. He just got off of two week mandatory ""sick"" leave because his therapist deemed him high risk and had him going to extra therapy"
