ptsd,fquesyn,t1_fquapzg,1589657625.0,"Thanks for the advice. And my logical mind totally agree with you but still most of the time I feel that how can a person be so cruel and selfish. And how can they get away with this kind of behavior. Why don't they feel remorse for their behavior. This narc I'm talking has been fired from at least three jobs as he gets confrontational with people for trivial things and starts to abuse them. Inspite of the all this, this guy fails to recognize that he is doing something wrong. He just plays a victim. It's hard to forget these kind of people once you encounter them. How did you recover from your Narcisstic experience ? I would love to move on but I got a mild ptsd due to his abuse."
ptsd,fqkyjor,t3_gjcxz0,1589440195.0,Did you mean EMDR ? Would love to know your experience. Keep us posted here
LifeAfterNarcissism,fqciz0r,t1_fqceinl,1589259442.0,Not exactly. But you have to do it consistently to feel the improvement.
LifeAfterNarcissism,fqb0qkq,t3_ghisy5,1589228562.0,"Maybe you have to live with these memories forever. It's just you need to control your emotional reactions towards these memories. Once you stop reacting or feeling sad, these bad memories will loose their power over you. Have you tried meditation ? I can say from personal experience that I helps."
ptsd,fq49cs5,t3_ggs5g7,1589074976.0,Comes and goes. All i can say is it has become manageable over these years.
ptsd,fpul9ti,t3_gfjctm,1588915928.0,Yes verbal bullying and abuse can cause PTSD
ptsd,fpul062,t3_gfmscf,1588915712.0,Thanks OP. It's so ironic that random strangers on Internet can be so understanding but people who we call friends can be so cruel sometimes. Happy to be a part of this community r/ptsd
ptsd,fpmoen7,t3_gebcwj,1588737632.0,"It takes sometime for PTSD to develop. In my case i was absolutely normal for about 6 months after trauma. I was even friends with the person who verbally abused me. And now I'm completely changed. I judge people, avoid friends who are rash. And definitely not a nice person and won't ever be."

Startup_Ideas,fpl8myo,t1_fpl8dbs,1588708305.0,"Personally I'm also thinking about something similar but no concrete idea yet. The issue is that you cannot just connect a mental health patient to a random stranger for counseling. Coz if the person on the other side isn't trained, then he will do more harm than good."
Startup_Ideas,fpl8dbs,t1_fpl775t,1588708171.0,"In my opinion, not everyone wants to open up about their mental health issues. So if there is a platform where people can anonymously connect to a therapist and get diagnosis and support, it will be great."

LifeAfterNarcissism,fphl0xg,t3_gdg2fb,1588623141.0,"Maybe he/she lacks awareness about Narcissist abuse and PTSD. It's not her fault. I had no knowledge of Narcisstic personality disorder before I had an encounter with a Narcisstic roommate. So my suggestion for you is that instead of depending on friends for healing, find a good therapist. Make sure your therapist is aware of Cluster B personality disorder abuse. Strictly stick to various online forums and groups that are dedicated to helping with Narcisstic abuse (psychopathfree.com). In my case reading audiobooks on topics of Narcissistic/Psychopathic abuse has helped me a lot to gain perspective. Also do regular meditations. Hope this helps."
startups,fpfgnc0,t3_gd5k62,1588570675.0,"Fellow Indian here, from reading your post it feels like you already have some knowledge of English. Its just you need some help with Grammar and Vocab. First of all don't get frustrated, it is just another language and you can learn it by putting some efforts. Have you tried using some free apps like Duolingo, Babble and Rosetta ? Also start watching Hollywood movies with english subtitles to improve your listening skills. For speaking practice, I would suggest talking to a friend or a toastmasters group."

They will always complain/rant about their boss, colleagues. All of their Ex are crazy, not just one. They won't have a stable friend circle that lasts more than a year. 

Ask questions about work-life, social circle, ex girlfriends. If all you hear is criticism, negativity and rants, just run !!!"
