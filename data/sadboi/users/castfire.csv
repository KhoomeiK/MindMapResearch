Anxiety,flcdv9a,t3_fnuqzd,1585027352.0,"I will admit that it’s odd if you don’t actually feel much stress anxiety or fear, and/or if you’ve never experienced anxiety interfering with your life or functioning. I don’t mean that in the sense of “you have to qualify with XYZ to have anxiety” — but rather in the sense that anxiety and other mental illnesses typically DO affect you and your life in a noticeable way, or at least in a way that you can notice “something’s different” or “something’s not right”. 

But the thing is, chronic anxiety, anxiety as a disorder, and anxiety as a mental illness overall IS different than what you imagine for the trait of anxiety. Chronic anxiety/etc can manifest in physical and physiological ways, and I’m sure that’s why people are pointing you in that direction. But even if you don’t experience excess of worry, guilt, fear, etc in your day to day life, it could still be possible to experience it chronically, in a way that’s subconscious (lack of a better word) and essentially manifests much more physiologically and maybe you don’t even register it consciously. 

It’s hard to say. Because on the one hand, if you literally think it’s not right, you don’t experience that, and you just KNOW it not to be true, then that’s one thing. But at the same time if everyone keeps saying the same thing to you, I wonder if you’re too close to the issue to have an accurate perspective on it. Maybe you’re so used to certain things that they never occurred to you as abnormal or a possible sign of anxiety. 

My take is, I’m not going to assume you have capital A anxiety if you really don’t think it rings true, but at the same time I don’t know if you’re saying it from misconceptions or pre-conceived notions of anxiety. It can definitely manifest in ways you don’t expect, so depending on your scenario, it COULD be totally true. I think you should go to a therapist or counselor — not saying you need to start therapy full time if that’s not your thing, BUT that’s the person to go to for an unbiased and educated perspective. That’s the person who could tell you more definitively if Anxiety describes you. They would have the background knowledge to be able to read your situation and learn more about your thought process etc, and be able to look at it and say “Yeah... seems like you’ve been living with anxiety this whole time” or not. 

Hope this helps. I deal with generalized anxiety disorder and other stuff too, and sometimes I almost forget about the anxiety because of how it just weaves into the fabric of my life. (that sounds depressing, don’t mean it that way lol)"

AmItheAsshole,fa8q3j1,t1_fa8ojcc,1575852020.0,"again, it's totally valid and there isn't one easy answer... I feel for you. but try to notice your trains of thought, and possibly redirect them when you are frustrated -- don't verbalize how much you hate *him*, how awful *he* is, how *he* is a burden ruining your lives. Because even if you never say those words out loud it will poison you, it will poison your relationship, how you treat him, and it will fuck him up for the rest of his life. I know that you know that being called these things are probably the worst things a child could ever hear. (Which is why I am sure you've never actually said them aloud - I would hope not.) 

Try to differentiate in your head between him as the person - who to be honest you probably haven't even met yet, as A. he hasn't developed into his own person yet, but mostly B., he has not had the tools or capacity to actually express himself yet -- and his awful behavior. I only reiterate this point so much because if you are not careful and you don't differentiate these things in your head, these behaviors will just turn into his personality. He will feel hated, he will know he's hated, he will know that you don't or can't see him as anything beyond his diagnoses, and that's how he is going to learn to see himself. He won't have the space to develop his own personality, hobbies, etc, outside of the diagnoses. Please don't forget the kid trapped inside that's dying to be heard - he might be unable to communicate it at this point, but he's there."
AmItheAsshole,fa8ozx6,t1_fa8o0bl,1575851294.0,"bro, i replied to another one of your comments in a similar fashion but you seriously need to be careful with this train of thought. it sounds like you are already starting to dehumanize him in your head. i'm not sure if you only feel this way in certain moments, and you're simply just venting no-holds-barred right now, or if you are actually letting yourself start to think this way on the regular. It's extremely damaging to both you and him if it's the latter -- stewing, holding grudges and building hate and resentment is the opposite direction you want to go in with a problem child. in fact, i mean, it's bad enough to stew and hold grudges on folks in life in general -- with a child, it's not even a discussion. It's just not a healthy train of thought, man. I know your situation isn't easy and I'm hoping the best for you and your family, but I hope that you get what I am saying."
AmItheAsshole,fa8of0d,t1_fa8ndxh,1575850899.0,"Hey man, I get you 100% but you don't need to call him a shithead. You have valid frustrations but getting in the habit of insulting your children in your head is a slippery slope, it will just build up your resentment and make you hate him. Please don't validate those thoughts and let them affect the way you treat him.

It's hard, because it's a valid feeling to have and there's also like, hardly any place where you can truly vent it or feel that way without guilt. But try to keep your head clear, and don't damage or hate the kid. I'm sure you hate his actions, how he behaves and how he chooses to communicate, but those will always grow and change etc -- but he should NEVER feel like you hate *him*, the kid.

It can be hard to find a balance between letting yourself feel your feelings and feeling valid in them, and beginning to let your feelings take precedence and start to become indignant or self-righteous."
AmItheAsshole,fa8m1nd,t3_e7t57k,1575849357.0,"NTA. When I first read the title my thought was ""YTA"", not due to the sentiment, but rather I was expecting you to have said it inappropriately (i.e., in front of the kids). But you didn't do that. You said it in the exact space and context that's correct for something like this.  
While it sucks, you're not an asshole for feeling this way, it is just how you feel, no ""buts"" about it. It isn't a bad thing, you sound like a great father, but it's completely reasonable to say that you would do it differently if you could do it again. I think the key is that you are not letting your personal feelings take importance over the actual wellbeing of your children. It sounds like you did it all right -- no one can say you're the asshole just for the way you feel, it would only be if you subjected your children to this, but you haven't.   
It ASTOUNDS me that your wife felt it appropriate to bring what you discussed in marriage counseling to your children. It is unbelievable that she told your child you wished he was never born??? You did everything you could do vent that feeling in a space and in a way where it would not have to affect your children, but your wife MADE it affect your children.

Of course the kids could pay their way if they had some notice or the plan changed. but you can't blame her for not currently being in a position to pay her own way when her mom has *told* her, ""don't worry about getting a job, please just focus on your studies, i will handle the school expenses."""

AmItheAsshole,f76axjh,t3_du534s,1573425892.0,NTA. You specifically told her how you didn't want this to happen. She made the thing happen that you  said would make you anxious & upset - of course you feel disappointed and weirdly violated

I know you said you don't have many friends at this point, but do you still go to therapy? That's probably your best bet at the moment to really vent this stuff to a neutral sounding board. Your therapist, if you've been seeing them for a while, knows the backstory too. They'll help you see what's real a bit more clearly so you don't have to worry about doubting your own brain"
