I know plenty of religious people who suffer or have suffered greatly with mental health problems. Doesn't seem to me that religious people have it better than atheists in regards to that.

My mother committed suicide this summer, after a lifelong struggle with bipolar disorder. She had a deep religious belief, but in spite of all her prayers, she never got better, and she grew more and more pessimistic with time. In the end, she took her own life because she wanted to be with god. She was convinced she was leaving this life for something better, so in a way, her belief pushed her towards suicide. 

Anyway, that is just one story of how religious believes can actually affect a person. I'm sure there are lots of research data on the matter, and now I'm curious to look them up. However, in my experience, life is not any easier for those with religious beliefs."
