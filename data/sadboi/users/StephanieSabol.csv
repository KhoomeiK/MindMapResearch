BipolarSOs,fov9q46,t3_g88b7x,1588097708.0,"I just didn‚Äôt want you to think what he saying about not really loving you to have any validly. I can imagine hearing that and it would just be devastating even if the person saying it is sick. I remember a loved one saying to me ‚ÄúI always thought if you said that it must be true in some way,‚Äù but it‚Äôs not, the things we say when we are in an episode come from a place that does not exist. It‚Äôs a delusion, just a symptom but If you are done with the relationship you have every right to be it‚Äôs so hard especially when someone is too scared to accept their illness and take medication. If you do stay in the relationship it will work best if you keep your finances separate and definitely fight his illness as a team but before that can happen he has to get help. Some of us have to lose everything before we will accept that our brain is broken which is one of the most difficult aspects of being bipolar. I wish you love and healing during this time I know it‚Äôs devastating, while it‚Äôs important not to give up on him in the middle of his episode once he is out of it you have to worry about not giving up on you whatever that means to you."
BipolarSOs,fonevvg,t3_g88b7x,1587918161.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry you are going through this. I have BP1 with psychotic features mixed episodes. I was untreated until a few years ago because I didn‚Äôt have support to help me get on medication and accept my illness. I also didn‚Äôt know or understand why I lost my mind, friends, everything I own. Of course I hurt all my loved ones, it was not my intention, my mind was confused so I said and did things I otherwise would not. Like black out while walking through a parking garage just in time to get run over by a car. I had no intention of believing my husband was having an affair it was a delusion and my response to that delusion was to freak out, I had no intention of believing my husband was trying to kill me. Bipolar disorder is incredibly hard to live with for the person affected and loved ones unfortunately are also affected. You have every right to want to leave, it‚Äôs a hard thing and it would be easier to be with someone healthy. I will tell you your partner is just confused, he would not spend three years with you and marry you if he loved his ex. If he‚Äôs in an episode he needs to go to his psychiatrist and get his medication adjusted or changed. If he‚Äôs currently in an episode the hospital is probably necessary right away. Bipolar disorder can be controlled with medication but it‚Äôs really a process to find a medication that works without too many horrible side effects. If he‚Äôs not on medication he needs to be because that is his only shot at a normal life. I‚Äôm so sorry you are going through this. I‚Äôve found for me the best thing my and my husband can do is get as much information about my disease as possible. It sounds like you really love your partner and you‚Äôve been through a lot. If you need a little help understanding I found a YouTube channel that really helped me it‚Äôs called Polar Warriors. The guy that doesn‚Äôt it really explains well the things we face with bipolar and how to deal. I also have a channel where I talk about what I‚Äôve been through with my disease and how it‚Äôs affected my family and friends if you think hearing someone else‚Äôs story might help. Sending you love, you sound like an amazing person."
BipolarSOs,foncudm,t1_fom71ua,1587917021.0,"Bipolar disorder is brain disorder that causes you to do things that you have no control over, just like someone with the flu throws up bipolar people do not Fuck with you for the joy of fucking with you. It‚Äôs a chemical imbalance a medical issue and needs to be treated as such. If you know someone with bipolar please do some research you could not be more wrong about your reaction."
bipolar,fonbrc4,t3_g8ermp,1587916412.0,You are really talented.
mentalhealth,fohgvu5,t3_g7dfru,1587765791.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry you are going through this. For me personally I have ptsd from all the psychotic episodes I‚Äôve had. What helps me is knowing none of it was my fault. I think if you talk to someone you can process what‚Äôs causing that, the shame and embarrassment which you don‚Äôt need to feel at all because none of it is your fault. I think unless you are someone who has been through it it‚Äôs tough to understand how damaging memories can be from seeing yourself in an uncontrollable state. Please consider seeing a talk therapist and a psychiatrist it‚Äôs really hard to get a good one of either but if you keep trying you‚Äôll find someone to help. Best of luck."
bipolar,fo05tpa,t3_g4g2jb,1587406598.0,That is awesome! It‚Äôs so hard to do anything when you are depressed!
mentalhealth,fnxz4di,t3_g4f4sj,1587349551.0,What you wrote is beautiful. I understand how you feel. I have a mental illness it‚Äôs debilitating and will kill me without medication and even with medication I struggle daily with the set of circumstances I‚Äôm given. I didn‚Äôt choose to be sick and I don‚Äôt make the choice to feel like I can‚Äôt get out of bed when I am sick. Your feelings are more than feelings they are real obstacles which most people don‚Äôt have to climb. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I started a daily YouTube vlog where I talk about my experience with mental illness/BP1 everyday. If you think that might help her not feel so alone please let her know it‚Äôs just Steph Sabol on YouTube. I‚Äôll definitely check out the Instagram account."
bipolar_irl,fmesjmt,t3_fqve2p,1586012542.0,"Yeah my doctor upped both my meds by a significant amount. It‚Äôs hard, I try to cope by finding funny stuff on YouTube or tiktok. I look at at cute furry animal videos. I hope you feel better. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
bipolar_irl,fmes7v1,t3_fl2zbe,1586012335.0,I spent so much of my life Unmedicated I had to tell my psychiatrist I don‚Äôt know what happy feels like. Is it mania or happiness?
bipolar_irl,fmes3gb,t3_fm0gqe,1586012257.0,I know this sounds lame but my mind starts and won‚Äôt get off a subject it can keep me up all night through yoga I found chanting. I know it sounds crazy but it really helps.
