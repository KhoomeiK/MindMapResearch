I try not to come off as awkward or anything but sometimes I end up doing the wrong thing which is why I just rather have as little friends as possible, that way Im not dealing with too many personas that would think Im a weirdo for every little subtle detail like being quiet or not being talkative enough, or saying things that come off as unusuall to the other person. I usually am dismissed as shy but this angers me and is not true. I only speak out of necessity, I cant just blurt out random words just to get someone to pay attention to me.

I can hardly stand people who try to play the innocent morally reichous victim, but I know people only act that way because they are guilty themselves. Humans are narcissistic and psycotic in nature, and people only come down on the ones who are more sadistic than they are. (Honestly I hope this covid 19 wipes out a chunk of the population, I started getting mad writing this because I just detests human beings) I feel physically exhausted all the time yet I am still expected to preform and succeed by my peers. We live in a nightmare and I trully despise happy people who pretend its all hunky dory because they have a surplux of things making them happy, but when you take all that away they would be just as miserable as I am.

I resent my parents for giving birth to him.

I have had one friend who was on the spectrum but he was very unlikable. My friend group no longer speaks of him. 

I dont have a problem with autisim. Its just certain people who have autisim are very hard to deal with and can cause alot of stress for their loved ones and I have little patience for it.
