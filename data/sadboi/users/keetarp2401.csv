teenagers,f320tvz,t3_df5p27,1570590045.0,"I know when your self esteem is shaken. Its like a cup shattered into many pieces; very hard to put it back together. I blame societies bad attitude towards her but its not that she herself is not responsible for this. Ask her to fight, make her question why she is being let down by society. I don't think a million people telling her that she's pretty is any way going to build her esteem unless she believes that she is. All it takes is one right person and a right time of telling her that she is what she wants, that is going to help her. I know this because i don't have this, that's why i know this will work."
