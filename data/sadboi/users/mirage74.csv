AskReddit,fo9zm7s,t3_g69kfu,1587635812.0,My friend in my 6th grade homeroom puked on the floor one day. That’s how we found out she was pregnant....we were 11. Every seen a pregnant kid? It’s not right....
NoStupidQuestions,fne5p44,t3_g0wa02,1586883511.0,"You have to plan for it. Read all the blogs about big families. Start thinking about logistics - is someone going to be stay at home parent? Which parent? What is your income situation going to look like and is there anything you can do now to supplement it (i.e saving more, investing in real estate etc)

The more thinking and planning you do, the easier it will be to manage once it happens!"

Assistance,flcsibz,t3_fng3cb,1585044644.0,There is no ‘normal’ path for grief - you can google the seven steps of grief and that may help but this isn’t something that is a straight forward path. It’s going to hurt a lot and some days the worst part is that you can manage it and you can move forward. Your dad wouldn’t have wanted this to be the end of you so don’t let it.

OutOfTheLoop,fcvsgoj,t3_ej57ls,1578009083.0,"I live in Maine and it’s best if you don’t use the big sites. Find a lake or area you want and then find the local realty place that does rentals. A lot of towns are starting to have strict air bnb rules so places are dropping from there.

antidiet,fcjxx5i,t1_fcj72g8,1577709866.0,"Because a lot of us have had severe eating disorders and don’t know how to eat for what our body needs.
Because diet culture is a constant lecture to women about how they are falling short.
Because being skinny isn’t the best shape for all bodies.
And shame on you for assuming that the people in this group aren’t healthy."
TrueOffMyChest,fc45fol,t3_eg02o3,1577407111.0,Haha...talk to us when you’ve had some kids and are married. Then you’ll see that most men do 50% before the kids come - kids through off the entire balance of the relationship. And Christmas? It definitely comes under the ‘kids’ part of your life once it happens.

ptsd,f37rlbt,t3_dfxido,1570729430.0,"Thank you!! I’ve actually always felt like I didn’t ‘deserve’ PTSD because I wasn’t in combat. Almost as if I didn’t have the right to claim that much suffering because of what happened to me.
Validating to hear a vet say you don’t feel that way."
ptsd,f2zpslx,t1_f2zmley,1570534314.0,Sounds like you have a good handle on things overall which is awesome! I do hate the periods when the PTSD seems to become more pronounced....haven’t we battled enough?
