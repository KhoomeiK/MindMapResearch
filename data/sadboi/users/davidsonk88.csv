birthcontrol,fj2d5so,t3_faxo74,1582940628.0,"I had the same fears! I was told not to have sex or use tampons for 48 hrs, but nothing about a bath. 

I had a bath and I’m still alive! 

My Kyleena was inserted 2 weeks ago and all seems to be good! 

Google can be your worst enemy sometimes. Try to relax and don’t be alarmed if you have cramping and bleeding - all par for the course during the first week.

birthcontrol,fi8w1rk,t3_f70ji8,1582249667.0,"I had a kyleena inserted about 10 days ago. I took 2 Advil 30 minutes prior. I won’t lie, my insertion was painful-but the pain was short lived. I went to work after and was able to complete the work day. 

Since then, I have experienced some mild cramping and some minor bleeding, all of which are normal. 

Like you, I only heard horror stories about IUDs and I was extremely terrified (to the point I almost backed out). I’m still getting used to knowing it’s inside of me.. for some reason I feel like it’s a tampon that I need to remove after 6-8 hours lol but I’m sure I’ll get used to that. 

Don’t let the horror stories freak you out. As with most medicines and procedures, nothing is truly risk free but the risks here a quite low. 

A doctor would not put something inside of you that is not safe-don’t forget that!!!"

truechildfree,fhpz4bf,t1_fhpsgo3,1581797122.0,"I’m aware there’s no guarantee. I work at a nursing home and see it first hand all the time. There’s also no guarantee my husband would help me because who knows we could be divorced? (I mean I hope not lol but nothing is for sure!)

Just a comforting thought that people will help you as you age, that’s all I’m saying. I know it’s not always realistic."
truechildfree,fhnsire,t3_f41h0c,1581731999.0,"I’m also completely on the fence, and it’s why I’ve joined this sub Reddit. 

I am leaning towards NO children.. but I cannot get rid of the “what if wake up when I’m 47 with no kids and regret it?” thoughts. 

I also have concerns about who may look after me in older age should I get ill and my husband is gone. (By the way, he’s also on the fence so we are on the same wave length). 

It’s so unsettling. I honestly feel like I don’t need children to have my life fulfilled, but I cannot get over these “what if” thoughts. 

I’m a 32 yr old female.. and while that’s still young, I do know I’ll need to decide in a few years should I choose to go the biological route. Financially, I’m not sure if adoption is an option. 

Being on the fence is tough. I wish I knew one way or the other. I hope this sub reddit helps shed some light on how other people de use."

I needed to read this. 
I got an IUD inserted 2 days ago and my anxiety has been working overtime. It’s like I’m waiting for something to go wrong.. 

The insertion was painful for me, but short lived. I have been experiencing cramping on and off, as well as minor bleeding on and off, and I’m trying really hard to tell myself it’s normal and it won’t last forever."
birthcontrol,fhg7vl7,t3_f31orz,1581560603.0,"In regards to the pain, it’s different for everyone. 
I had an IUD inserted today actually, and it was painful. I won’t lie. However, the pain was short lived. The intense pain lasted approx 3-5 minutes, and then I felt some cramping for the rest of the day. I took 2 Advil before and really focused on deep breathing. 
Some doctors will offer a freezing agent to the area-so if you’re really concerned, you could inquire about that :)"

Thank you!!"

I live in Canada, and I’m not sure where you live - but there are programs in place here for people who cannot work due to disability. Again, I’m not sure where you live but it might be worth looking into if there are any financial assistance programs to help you (if you haven’t looked into it already). I wish I had an answer for your pain - everyone has different anecdotal stories about what helps with pain - CBD, yoga, pain meds, etc - so I don’t know if you have anything that currently helps to relieve any of your pain - but I certainly don’t want you to give up on life. You have so many things to live for and I really hope you can recognize that!!"

HealthAnxiety,fd5yu6j,t3_ek3w8x,1578183225.0,"I am sorry you feel this way. I hope you can find some comfort in this online community. I’ve struggled for quite some time with health anxiety, thinking everything and anything will kill me. I agree with another comment on this post about distraction - it’s hugely beneficial. 
I also recommend not resorting to google. Googling your symptoms will only lead you down a path that will make your anxiety worse 

When I’m having awful moments like this, I try to tell myself “this is your anxiety talking”. I also find taking 5-10 long deep breaths can be amazing. I know a lot of people might think deep breathing doesn’t work; but it’s worth a shot. 

Your friends and family will love you through this. People who truly care about you will not walk away. I am sorry that you feel alone. I wish you strength to get through this tough time."

I do believe that working in a field where I see death so frequently has contributed to my health anxiety. I don’t recall it ever being this bad before I started my career.. before I started to see people die on a regular basis, and see people suffer from strokes/hip fractures/etc and not being able to make things completely better for them. 
I’ve actually been to therapy for this specific issue - trying to separate what I see at work from my personal life. It’s a tough battle for me, and I know I take my work home. 
I really wish I could go back to the days where I didn’t think about death 24/7. It’s emotionally draining."
