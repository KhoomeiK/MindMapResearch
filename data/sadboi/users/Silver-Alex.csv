DID,fqgngmg,t3_giri0i,1589351173.0,"In ""Boogiepop and Others"" (the 2019 version is the one I saw) the protagonist is very obviously DID, but its taken on the supernatural side of things. I was good watch tho.

""Birdy the mighty"" also has a DID-Esque protagonist. The protagonist duo are a ""generic high-school-protagonist guy"" and a female badass space cop that end up sharing a body because of reasons. A decent part of the anime is dedicated to the balancing of the dual life they have.

""Kuuchuu Buranko"" apparently focuses on a psychiatrist with DID as the protagonist, but I haven't watched that one yet, so it might be a hit or miss.

And regarding trauma, or just psychological anime there is quite a few.

""Psycho-pass"" is an excellent noir sci-fi detective drama that deals a lot with psychology, but it has very heavy content, so trigger warning. The first season is considered a cult classic, made by the same author as madoka, with the newer seasons (made by a different director and writer), pale in comparison.

""Fate/Zero"" Is also DEEPLY psychological, and VERY mature and different from the rest of the Fate/ franchise. And that's because it was written by the same author as Madoka, so that pretty much tells you anything you should need to know. Watch this. Everything this man writes is a psychological masterpiece.

""Monster"" is a cult classic too. ""Evangelion"" is always the go-to psychological anime. You also have ""Death Parde"".

""Steins:Gate"" delves deep into the psychology side of things, despite being a sci-fi. There is a real focus in the protagonist's craziness without it eating the whole story.

""Higurashi"" is well... Edgy as fuck, and can get extremely violent and sometimes gorey, and I dont really recommend it as it was something I LOVED during my ""edgy teen"" phase, but haven't watched it as an adult. Not a watch for everyone. But danm, isn't it a fun psychological thriller.  This is also a cult classic.

And lastly ""Bakemonogatari"". I love and hate this series. Sporting excellent writing, excellent animation, a very diverse cast of broken and flawed people, mixing psychology and the supernatural to create a deep and profound anime.... Filled with an UNREASONABLE amount of fanservice, especially regarding the younger characters... So. This without the creepy pedo vibes would be literally my favorite anime ever. It has everything to be a masterpiece, but if you're uncomfortable with *literal molestation of minors as comedy,* it can be hard to watch. Watch at your own risk. As an anime fan you probably have encountered this fanservice problem elsewhere, so if you can get over it, this is a really good series.

edit: ""mekaku city actors"" is decent. Wont call it a masterpiece, or anything like that, but it was a fun, surreal watch.

Hope this helps! If you tell more about the kind of animes you like, I can recommend some more."

From the trusty ISSTD treatment guidelines. Ie the international scientific group that has been studying DID for decades and has tons of empirical evidence to back up:  


""Although the DID patient has the subjective experience of having separate identities, it is important for clinicians to keep in mind that the patient is not a collection of separate people sharing the same body. The DID patient should be seen as a whole adult person, with the identities sharing responsibility for daily life. Clinicians working with DID patients generally must hold the whole person (i.e., system of alternate identities) responsible for the behavior of any or all of the constituent identities, even in the presence of amnesia or the sense of lack of control or agency over behavior (see Radden, 1996). Treatment should move the patient toward better integrated functioning whenever possible.""  


This sub stands by this. And you can find the guidelines along many other resources in our wiki and FAQ.

DID,fpsoa71,t1_fprtq7q,1588876832.0,"Hey. To be honest that's hard to tell. I like to assume that the majority of users posting for support regarding their DID were diagnosed at some point, as self diagnosing is something we stand against in this sub, but honestly its not easy to tell. 

What would be your follow up question?"
DID,fpqwvn5,t3_gf0ssk,1588834690.0,"You should probably talk with your therapist about this. If you aren't diagnosed and are assuming DID, then your HAVE to talk with your therapist, as the symptoms you describe could probably be better explained by a combination of other factors (like for example, BPD shows a lot if not all those symptoms without the alters of DID). DID comes along with a lot of baggage besides the alters, with Dissociation being the primary one. 

If you are diagnosed DID, you're *probably* more integrated than the majority of the users here. This is why you see yourself as different personality states of the same person (take this with a grain of salt, it's just a conjecture based on the little information a text post can provide).

One important thing to remember is the trusty Treatment Guidelines by the ISSTD:

""Although the DID patient has the subjective experience of having separate identities, it is important for clinicians to keep in mind that the patient is not a collection of separate people sharing the same body. The DID patient should be seen as a whole adult person, with the identities sharing responsibility for daily life ... Treatment should move the patient toward better-integrated functioning whenever possible.""

So assuming DID, or OSDD, you're good, and going along exactly what's recommended by the treatment guidelines. When you see other users talking about alters as ""whole different persons"" it just means that the dissociative barriers between them are very strong. Each system is free to see themselves as they can, but empirical evidence proves than a higher quality of life and functioning is directly correlated to how integrated the alters are in a system. And this is exactly what treatment aims to achieve."

High thc weed kinda fucks us up (in a fun way), but CBD and the like are actually pretty relaxing and helps us cope. Still, the issue with weed (and any drug, really) is that it helps you to forget your issues, not to deal with them"
DID,fpppb2s,t3_getqx3,1588806543.0,"Well, first of, let me start by telling you we also have a ""demon"" alter. A gal with ripped and tattered wings, small horns, and a tail. For a while, the system had issues her, not due to her non-humanity (we reeeeeeally don't care about that, half of our alter have some form of non-human feature), but because she was acting like one of our abusers. This lead to a period where she and the other host hated each other and there was a lot of abuse going inside the headspace. Ultimately it was no healthy for anyone involved.

So, regarding appearance. This is purely anecdotal, but most of the system I talked about this are similar in this regard, with the appearance of an alter being related to their well being. In particular, the more hurt our ""demon"" alter appears in the headspace, the more unstable she's when fronting and more prone to self-harm. While on the other hand the times she looked healthy (not having any cuts in her body, her wings in good shape, and so) she was actually a pretty darn good host. 

Now on your case, I don't think the host dislikes her just because she looks like a demon. I honestly think that the source of dislike is because it reminds (s)he of your csa trauma. And honestly, that's normal. Our current host hated another alter because she brought to light csa memories and that kinda fucked us all, and its slowly learning to tolerate her. In your case, you need more compassion and communication. This demon alters is very probably suffering, and having your host keep her way from the system isn't helping. Your host on the other side needs professional help, you all need it, tbh it really helps. And you need more support. Both the host and the demon alter are parts of the system, and they MUST learn to cooperate and support each other. Wish you the best on all this! You were brave to share all this."

""Although the DID patient has the subjective experience of having separate identities, it is important for clinicians to keep in mind that the patient is not a collection of separate people sharing the same body.

Personally, each time I tried having an open relationship, or just a particular alter dating someone while the others didn't it was a mess. You cant control switches, alters getting jealous of each other, the partner being all confused. No thanks, from that point onwards we only date as a system, and if someone wants to get in a serious relationship with us, they have to know and accept all of us.

All this is quoted from the treatment guidelines, by the ISSTD, the ""International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation"". A non profit international scientific organization that have been studying trauma and DID for decades, and not only are super respected but also actually helped a lot of DID people heal from their trauma and improve their life.

On treatment, and parts vs persons:

"" Although the DID patient has the subjective experience of having separate identities, it is important for clinicians to keep in mind that the patient is not a collection of separate people sharing the same body. The DID patient should be seen as a whole adult person, with the identities sharing responsibility for daily life. Clinicians working with DID patients generally must hold the whole person (i.e., system of alternate identities) responsible for the behavior of any or all of the constituent identities, even in the presence of amnesia or the sense of lack of control or agency over behavior (see Radden, 1996).

Treatment should move the patient toward better integrated functioning whenever possible. In the service of gradual integration, the therapist may, at times, acknowledge that the patient experiences the alternate identities as if they were separate. Nevertheless, a fundamental tenet of the psychotherapy of patients with DID is to bring about an increased degree of communication and coordination among the identities.

In most DID patients, each identity seems to have its “own” first-person perspective and sense of its “own” self, as well as a perspective of other parts as being “not self.” The identity that is in control usually speaks in the first person and may disown other parts or be completely unaware of them. Switches among identities occur in response to changes in emotional state or to environmental demands, resulting in another identity emerging to assume control. Because different identities have different roles, experiences, emotions, memories, and beliefs, the therapist is constantly contending with their competing points of view.

Helping the identities to be aware of one another as legitimate parts of the self and to negotiate and resolve their conflicts is at the very core of the therapeutic process. It is countertherapeutic for the therapist to treat any alternate identity as if it were more “real” or more important than any other...

...A desirable treatment outcome is a workable form of integration or harmony among alternate identities. Terms such as integration and fusion are sometimes used in a confusing way. Integration is a broad, longitudinal process referring to all work on dissociated mental processes throughout treatment ""

&#x200B;

I know its a hard read to digest, but there is actual science and empiric evidence backing it up, plus decades of research behind this. The goal is not to invalidate you in any way, but you increase your inner system communication thus making life easier to handle. If you don't like the word ""part"" just don't use, use alter instead for example. But it's important  understand that you all together are a whole. You're not broken nor you are less real than anyone else. Hope this helps to clarify things a little.

Also, it's the more universally understood word, so that's really our only reason for liking it. I really don't care about the terms, as long as they're easy to understand. Same with ""alters"", we don't like it or dislike it, it's just the more universally understood.   


I do dislike ""multiple"", because other communities use it to describe non-trauma/dissociation multiplicity, so ""system"" feels something that belongs more to DID"
DID,fpewgk2,t3_gd1fpk,1588556436.0,"Having alters go dormant is something that happens to most of us. I know it's hard at first, but it's just something that happens. When your first host went dormant I felt like I lost one of my closest friends. But then he came back some months after. And well, now, by this point we're on our third and fourth hosts e.e So don't worry, let her be, she probably *needs* this time to be by herself. Its not a goodbye, but a see you later."
DID,fpehr1a,t3_gcwxr8,1588547792.0,"So, first of all, a split is something that's usually very rare, its more likely that a dormant alter came to the front. As far as I know (lacking sources on this, tho) most of the splits happen in childhood, during the traumatic events that caused DID/OSDD by stoping the natural integration of the parts. 

That being said. I had some experience with this whole ""new alters"" thing. 

Last year, our system was composed of three fronting alters, a little, and a fictive protector we didn't really know about at the time. But then the little and the host were involved in a very traumatic event  TW: >!Sexual abuse!< So to answer your questions

1)The new alter started as a fragment that showed up a week or so after the event. Further traumatic events some months after >!(a rough breakup with a long time partner, loosing the first nice job we had in years, then the host falling into a suicidal depression)!< caused her to fully develop as an alter and start hosting, to get our life back in tracks

2) not that I can remember. 

3)Again, nope. I'm co-conscious with her, and I remember how she was utterly confused about who she was and her role in the system the first time she fronted. It took her a couple of days to adapt and figure who she was, and coming up with a name.

However, one thing worth pointing out is that we have proof of her being here with us some years ago, before the dx. We're not sure if she was just a fragment at the time, acting through us via influences, or if she was a full alter, as our memories before the diagnosis are very foggy, the host at the time is AWOL, and since we didn't know about DID, everything is very confusing. The fact that she, in some was there, remains tho. 

Regarding our other ""new"" alters, well, the stay at home orders, the fear of a global pandemic, plus the fact that we're on unpaid leave while this passes caused a big shift in the system. An old persecutor and an old host came from dormancy, but they're most definitely not a split. We have proof of them existing before, it's just that our memory is shitte."

DID,fp3tybq,t3_gb5ntm,1588285753.0,"> ... I guess if he can’t accept it then our relationship is not meant to be ...

This here is, sadly, the reality. You should disclose it sooner than later. Especially if he has already meet other alters. I'm not sure how's the best way to tell it, but I would start explaining trauma and referring to alters as parts, at least at first. I'm firmly on the boat of ""dating as a system"", so I asked my last partner to see all of us as parts, not as separate persons, and that actually helped to ease things. Same with my friends, it was easier to explain to them things like ""part of me wants to do x, but another wants y""."
DID,fp3s5b6,t3_gawio8,1588284813.0,"Thanks you so much for this post! the thing with child parts was spot on. And I want to share two anecdotes regarding that.

First, of. One of the (many) fucked up things about my childhood, was my mom constantly telling me that since I was the ""man of the house"", I had to take care of her. This was later confirmed by my therapist to be extremely harmful, as inverting the parent/children role hampers a normal development and is considered a form of abuse. So, to ask your kids to take care of your children's part IS messed up.

Secondly. One of our young parts is Silvy. She used to be a little, but thanks to nearly two years of weekly therapy she's now more of a teen(?). Our psychiatrist was very versed in DID, and her primary focus of therapy was maturing her to a point where she could be semi-functional, and not just a little kid. Last year, after we moved out to a new country, we had to look for a job in, well, basically anything. The first job we got was as caretakers of an old guy that was on wheelchairs. Silvy, despite being a young part, was able to do the job without many issues. Her switches were still a bit obvious (the old guy's wife one day told us jokingly that sometimes I was a kid, and sometimes a proper adult). But despite Silvy's infantile attitude, she was still able to do all that was required of the job. This included taking care of hygiene, cooking, controlling which meds the patient took, keeping him safe, and calling a doctor if he was having an issue. This is, of course, are thanks to all the therapy.

So I honestly think that if you're a system, and you're planning to have kids, the very first thing you have to do is going to a specialist, and prepare/mature your younger parts to be able to handle the responsibility of kids.  Same with any fictivies, or animal parts. They need to be grounded up, preferably with the help of a specialist."

DID,fotf156,t3_g9cxsj,1588052038.0,"My advice would be the same to fictives. Slowly ground them up and helping them understand that they're not literally an animal / a character from a fictional media, but an alter that takes characteristics from those. And help them understand what's the actual reality they live in, such as the body they have, where they live, friends, and relationships.

We have two fictives that are grounded up and pretty functional. One is a girl with dog/wolf features who saw herself as a space marine kind of thing, and thanks to a lot of therapy she now sees herself as a girl with an interest in military stuff, space, and adventures. She has developed those interests, doing things as going to shooting ranges, or playing paintball, and studying a lot of astrophysics as a hobby. She still does stuff like growl at people or things, or sniff her food before eating, but understands common sense and how to ""act properly"" when the situation calls for it, like in front of our boss at work."

After all, how can you notice that you forgot something? We were on denial of our amnesia until we were faced with innegable evidence, like actually forgetting important stuff, or people telling us repeated times about things that we forgot.

All I've told them, and only after issues were apparent, as that I have PTSD along with mood swings due to repeated traumas in life, and they were understanding of that and of my triggers.

They're a fully developed individual, and integration doesn't refer to just fusion. Integration refers to when the whole system processes a bit of information (usually that being repressed traumatic memories, and thus allowing to heal). Treating each alters as a separate person (not as a separate ""individual"" that are parts of a whole) can cause issues. Think of stuff like ""no I didn't cheat on you it was another person"" or just simply each alters doing what they want without regard for the system. Additionally, that goes against the basis of treatment, which is to promote cooperation and teamwork, separating alters from each other might end up strengthening the dissociative barriers between them then and thus making the whole disorder harder to handle on a day to day basis. Weaker dissociative barriers means less amnesia, less dissociation, and more functionality."

Before entering a relationship seriously we need that the person knows about us, is willing to date all the mature parts and cares about the young ones. But then again, that's us and that's based on our previous, failed, relationships. 

You're not a terrible person for being uncomfortable with a nonmonogamous relationship, however, you can't force them to be in one either if they don't want. Ultimately you need to talk this with them as a system, and one of you needs to make a concession. Either you accept an open relationship, they accept a monogamous one, or the relationship ends. This is not just a DID issue per se, this is more about different views on relationships, and you would be facing the same problem if you were dating a singlet that's only into poly relationships."
DID,fmvm7nv,t3_fxial8,1586422125.0,"I'm so sorry that you're having to go through this, and honestly, it is unfair for you. I know that each system is different, but due to how badly our last relationship ended, we decided to date only as a system and being frontal about it as soon as possible. Previously we date seriously a gal for nearly four years, but neither of us was aware of my DID when the relationship started. An alter almost cheated on her, many promises were broken or forgotten, we were way too inconsistent, and ultimately she just fell in love with the idea of a man that never existed, a fusion of some of our alters that didn't include everyone, nor was possible to maintain.   


So regarding your situation, communication is the key. Tell them that it has been months since you acted as a proper couple and that you suspect or know that something is up with them. Don't tell them that a family member told you, but if the conversation leads well, tell them that he told you long ago about DID. Wish you the best of luck on this!"

The site is a bit outdated, and some of the stuff it says its no longer valid, but it can be used as a good resource to understand the disroder.  In particular this is worth pointing out to your fiance:  


> Unfortunately, even some individuals who might otherwise want to integrate can find it impossible to integrate all of their parts or to maintain one integrated personality over time or when faced with stress. This can occur when an individual is in a highly stressful or unsafe environment, can't bring themself to fully accept their trauma history, can't access treatment from professionals who are knowledgeable about DID,  or can't afford to continue treatment or when symptoms from comorbid personality or other disorders interfere. Some question if integration is even permanently possible, and many therapists are less insistent on full integration as the only possible treatment for DID than they were in the past. Even if a therapist tries to push their client to integrate, permanent integration cannot be forced, and an integration that occurs before the system was ready for it is very likely to fall apart. 

A full fusion/Integration can take years of therapy and healing, can't be forced and might no be possible at all. He HAS to accept you as a system if he wants to have a healthy relationship."
