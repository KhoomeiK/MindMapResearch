Resume,fghiaoq,t3_eyhlbk,1580785446.0,"I only took a quick glance but often people make their resumes look more like a timeline. Job titles, organization, dates and list some responsibilities under each. More clear headings like that would help.

Edit: sorry, now I see that you likely redacted that info which makes sense. It was such a neat line I thought it was a design aspect."

She ended up getting scammed by a fake cat breeder for $600 who didn’t give her whatever pure breed she thought she was getting. I don’t feel bad for her at all. She deserves it. If you’re allergic find a different pet or stock up on allergy meds. I’m allergic but I deal with it. I understand some allergies are much worst but find a different solution.
nonprofit,fdpgqkp,t1_fdopopm,1578628188.0,"I do understand that, but I’m sure there’s a decent middle ground in another type of job or industry. Any non-profit experience I’ve had is essentially that I’m doing the job of 2 or 3 employees. There’s never downtime."

The workload is insane, they won’t hire anyone else to help, and when I express my need for support I’m not only gaslighted but given MORE tasks. Obviously not every charity is this way but they’re underpaid and awful. My only thing right now is I’m trying to push back and won’t work extra. Unless they want to pay me overtime (they won’t).

The moral of the story is volunteer in your spare time or fundraiser for a cause you care about, but don’t work for non-profits."

For myself I debated only adding in the health benefits I didn’t get covered because otherwise I’m usually paid back within a week or two. So I don’t count that as an expense per se except what didn’t get covered. Not exactly the same situation but seemed kinda similar.

We usually give the pill to him 2 hours before doing the fluids or before vet visits. We don't do it for every vet visit, only if they need to shave him or do his nails or a blood test. If he's prodded at he gets pretty upset so we use it for that. I think vets use it fairly commonly but not a vet myself.
