AMA,fcyufdx,t1_fcysadq,1578087311.0,"In short, my family and doctors decided that treating my symptoms as I go about life would be better than treating the tumor itself, so to speak. I was on medication that prevented me from finishing my puberty until I was old enough, which worked out well. My parents caught on the issue soon enough that I could get the medication and have a somewhat normal life. I started my period at 12, as opposed to being a small child and not being able to understand what was going on. I’ve also struggled with chemical imbalances and anxiety as a result of the tumor, and I’ve treated that with therapy and daily medication.

It was 13/14ish years ago now that they found the tumor and doctors described it as inoperable. Now, there is technology to operate, but it wouldn’t be a good option for me. There’s a chance I could go blind if I had the surgery, and my current issues are easier to deal with than being blind.
