However, we can test this much more easily by simply seeing what happens if we create a file with an ID like `404` in the level editor and try `MAKE`ing a file that has the same ID. Since there's no ""left over"" state after the counter has overflowed back to 400, there's no reason why overflowing past 400 and back should behave any different."

Codependency,fhzasa0,t1_fhyuino,1581994824.0,"Yup.

I think it's disturbingly common that the ""codependent"" in a relationship is often the one with the bigger ego - they pour so much energy and love into somebody they think needs ""saving"" because they *expect* them to give them love in return. It's a way of manipulating others, while simultaneously convincing yourself that you're doing it for them. I suspect a lot of codependents may have ambivalent attachment styles, characterized by pouring excessive amounts of love and attention into the people we want to love us back; only to feel agitation or outright annoyance if they don't ""reward"" us for our efforts in the way we were hoping. Some people end up splitting on or lashing out at the person they're supposed to be loving, others end up just devaluing, disregarding and discarding them, but the ""dependent trap"" is to self-gaslight for getting annoyed at the person you're supposed to be loving, and lovebomb them even harder to try and make up for our own feelings of guilt. It's a vicious cycle because it sets you up for abuse by preventing you from self-sabotaging the relationship.

Healing from codependence isn't just becoming aware of the cycle, and not continuing to fall into the trap of falling in love with people who need to be ""saved""; it's also a very big part of self-reflection and realizing that we are being unfairly manipulative on the people whose affection we try ""engineering"" with our codependent behavior."
Codependency,fhz9mwp,t3_f5bwbt,1581994052.0,"The literature often says that somebody with attachment issues becoming attached to somebody with secure attachment is one of the ways to heal those attachment issues. You sort of ""normalize"" your sense of attachment by being able to lean on the source of stability and sanity and eventually absorb it by osmosis, rather than falling into the usual anti-pattern of seeking out other people with attachment issues for either explosively clingy or ""escape-chase"" style relationships, which just reinforces the issue.

That being said I can't really counsel your recent relationship as I am not even remotely qualified to do so. But I did want to comment on your suspicion that he may have not been able to fall in love with you because ""you don't need saving"", and I definitely think that's relevant here. As somebody with severe attachment issues himself, one of the most important components of codependency/insecure attachment is a very strong feeling of worthlessness, of not being able to provide anything for my partners. I latch onto partners that I think I can ""save"" because this is the only way I know how to feel needed/loved. Somebody who clearly doesn't depend on me telling me they like me / love me makes me feel guilty, conflicted and even outright confused - I don't experience any of the signs of them ""depending on me"" so how can they say they love me? Because ""being viscerally depended on"" is the only expression of love you know, anything else is just alienating."

CPTSD,fhwfknq,t1_fhvzxh1,1581914388.0,"> So if you want my judgement, it is this: you're being honest, possibly more honest than most.

This is so true it hurts. Really when it comes down to it, a lot of social media (reddit included) is posturing and virtue signalling. Because all of us, but especially those of us who've been neglected, are desperate for the approval of others. We self-censor incessantly. We don't show our true faces, the ones beneath the masks. Being so dishonest on places such as /r/CPTSD which spread an atmosphere of ""positive encouragement"" may not even be helping us, except by providing us with a fuel of social acceptance that we can rely on to self-excuse our own learned *bad* survival instincts rather than confronting them.

""It's okay, I don't need to change, because I posted the best sides of myself on an online forum and they accepted me for being who I am, therefore I can *continue living with a system of extremely destructive interpersonal survival instincts*"". Or maybe that's just the trap I tend to fall into.

This is why I'm glad /r/CPTSDFightMode exists, note, because it's a place deliberately created to avoid having to show your best sides. Because when it comes down to it, everybody who's learned to survive has on some level learned to manipulate, to distrust, and to serve their own needs over the needs of others, even if for some of us that means making sure other people are happy.

And when I stop self-pitying and self-praising and really boil things down, I hate the person I am *far more* than I could possibly hate anybody else. I want to overcome my past, not wallow in its aftershocks. This requires focusing on the real problems and finding real solutions for them."

Amen to that. Amen so hard. Growing up isolated and alone makes you think of nobody but yourself. Growing up with an emotional deficit makes you desperate to fulfill those deficits. Growing up learning to rely on your intuition rather than logic and reason makes it difficult for you to accept changes to your worldview. Growing up being bullied by everybody you know makes you learn to hate other people and carry a pill of resentment for the rest of your life. Growing up amidst unstable social surroundings makes you used to withdrawing from people and ""finding new friends"" at the first sign of conflict.

It show cases the difference between fawn and fight more responses pretty clearly, in my opinion. I'm freeze+fight and I hate it. I hate every aspect about myself and I wish I could hate myself into being a better person, but it doesn't work that way."

Codependency,fhtssnm,t1_fhtncxg,1581877784.0,"The anxious/ambivalent attachment style combined with the hole in your chest causes you to incessantly manipulate people to fill that emotional void; but then blowing up at the slightest bit of conflict or criticism and going into full nuclear meltdown mode either a la ""fine I don't need you anymore, you suck anyways, I was better off alone anyways""-style devaluation as a preferred conflict avoidance strategy, often cycling between the two.

In the extreme case, they will both end up pathological liars and selfish manipulators who bounce from relationship to relationship as soon as it shows signs of not being the source of unconditional love they're secretly looking for. The NPD will just assume they're just being the way they are and continue trying to abuse other people to solve their own baggage rather than actually confronting it; while the BPD will realize they're the source of the issue, want to kill themselves because of it, and assume they deserve to lie down in the dirt and eat worms because nobody will ever love them and their baggage.

That's my personal perspective on it anyway. These disorders manifest themselves in different ways in everybody. I have personally been diagnosed with BPD but I still suspect I'm probably just a narcissist so hard in denial about his own narcissism that I've convinced myself to pretend to feel bad about any of what I do and started believing my own manipulative lies.

(Oh, I also believe that ""codependent"" and ""narcissist"" are disturbingly close together. I'm pretty sure I exhibit characteristics of both. I mentally cringe every time I hear people on social media blaming their ""toxic ex"" on being the source of their misery, because the usual relationship dynamic in the real world is that both parties are being horrible on each other while each being in denial about their own behavior.

It's like, being mentally ill is considered socially acceptable if you have a sob story to back it up with. But if your ""trauma story"" amounts to little more then ""I never had friends and my parents disagreed with my lifestyle choices and tried changing me"", you end up being ridiculed and feeling invalidated as fuck for turning out such a failure of a human being even though ""oThERs hAd iT Way wORsE"".

I relate to this hard as fuck. My own past was mostly defined by early childhood separation trauma, frequent moves (no peer stability or friends), a pattern of punishment by authority figures, school/sibling bullying and parents that constantly tried ""fixing"" me by applying pressure rather than attempting to understand. You know, the usual stuff kids go through. Nothing that's a sob story, even though remembering it still makes me personally break out in tears for some reason. Other people would probably find it ridiculous, which is a big part of the reason I struggle honestly talking about it. I don't feel valid enough to even post on /r/CPTSD. I comment sometimes but I'm pretty sure I don't belong here, and I feel guilty for pretending I do.

I'm sorry you're struggling with similar feelings, OP. But at the end of the day, it's as they say: don't compare trauma stories. You'll only end up self-invalidating.

Not sure I understand what you're asking. I meant in the sense of, like, I imagine individual *moments*, like snapshots into my fantasy life. I don't ""paint in my mind"", as in, I don't deliberately ""build up"" the scenes - I vividly imagine them wholepiece. But I struggle letting them ""play out"" - I get distracted by other thoughts and often move onto some other scene. The scenes have little correlation between each other - they're just individual ""moments I would like to experience"", not necessarily with the same people. I care about their emotional content more than their ""information content""; once I'm done feeling the emotion I no longer care to think about what would happen next in this scene.

I do also hold conversations in my head but they're detached from any physical reality - I'll only imagine the conversation itself happening, independent of any imagery or scenery.

> Also, if I may too ask, how quickly do the images pass? Can't you just write the idea down and come back to it later, or is it truly just gone, or..?

The images don't pass, just my interest in them? I could hold on to them longer if I wanted to, I feel like I just don't have the patience or motivation for it. Even when I start trying to draw them, I'd rather put down the pencil and doodle something random while continuing to fantasize. It requires *work* to prevent myself from drifting off, and I don't find drawing to be rewarding enough to justify putting in that work.

I don't personally do this; I can't keep a consistent narrative.

The fictitious people from my daydreams aren't ""consistent characters"", they're amalgamations.

Or being in a social situation but realizing I haven't actually been paying attention to what's being said because I'm lost in my own thoughts and daydreams. Being spoken at and needing a few seconds to realize somebody's trying to get my attention, because I had to interrupt my train of thoughts first and needed a bit to readjust to reality and turn the ""social auto-pilot"" back on.

Or watching the world ""shrink away"" and wondering if I'm dreaming or if this is really happening - sometimes to the point where things literally seem farther away than they are, or like these are just scenes on a movie theater screen rather than things I'm viewing with my own eyes. Listening to myself speak rather than consciously speaking, only to stop speaking mid-sentence because I forgot to continue speaking since I was so busy being distracted by how weird it felt listening to myself speak.

Online, there's an implicit assumption that everybody here has put in more than the bare minimum amount of research, so we take their claims with a bit of implicit faith. (This goes for all mental health related subreddits, e.g. in your OCD example) But for CPTSD specifically, because it's such an extremely emotionally charged diagnosis, most likely you're actually being thrown off by them simply making light of the matter by nonchalantly dismissing something as ""oh I have this"" without an actual *emotional reaction* to it.

The story you'll usually find here is that people will gush about how they finally understood what's wrong with them. My first reaction to actually reading up on CPTSD (and breaking my own misconceptions in the process) was to begin crying longer and harder than I've ever cried in the past decade.

Something I'm wondering: Since you described him as your ""favorite person"", has he expressed any romantic interest for you before this attempt? Or would you describe your interest in him as one-sided? Have you ever gotten a straight answer from him about his feelings for you, and what exactly did he actually express when he rejected your advance?

Just because he isn't willing to reciprocate sexual advances doesn't necessarily mean you are ugly or broken. There are a lot of other reasons he could have had; for example something I noticed is that I get strong feelings of guilt about somebody ""approaching"" me like that, *especially* if I wasn't sure if I was romantically interested in them. I'd feel like I was abusing them, even if it's something they offered to me. This is independent of how attractive they are.

I realize that at the end of the day, he still rejected you, and that's something you're going to have to deal with, as hard as it is. I'm not sure I can offer any words that will take that feeling away - the only thing I *can* provide is a potential perspective for why that need not mean you're somehow ugly or ""sexually undesirable"".

(Small side note: Ironically, remarks such as ""even though he's male and single"", as though that fact somehow makes him sexually desperate enough to leap at any opportunity being offered to him, only serve to reinforce a negative stigma of men as being driven purely by sex, and the resulting generational self esteem collapse from being demonized in this way is a big part of what *leads* to feelings of guilt causing men to reject sexual advances.

CPTSD,fhjubn4,t3_f3jzpq,1581655828.0,"Freezing up like that is my natural reaction to anything unexpected happening, not just loud noises. The other day I was attempting to ""dock"" a chair onto a table (the way you probably did back in school), and when I let it go it did a ""clank"" as gravity made it settle slightly into place. My first reaction was to somehow assume it was about to fall down and had a ""full body cringe"" like that since I was preparing myself for danger. But the thing is that I was already mentally fearing it falling down and trying to place it as carefully as I could, so because I was already internally anticipating that bad thing happening, the slightest noise freaked me out a ton because I assumed it must be a sign of that. This is pretty much exactly how hypervigilance works: you're constantly anticipating something bad happening so even the slightest unexpected sensation makes you jump as your brain assumes it's proof of that bad scenario actually happening.

But yeah, I know what you mean - a lot of people scream in response to loud noises (e.g. my mother does this), but I go into ""protection mode"" (cringing and covering my face). I think part of it might be simply because I generally avoid trying to make any noise if at all possible, and usually have the issue of speaking too softly / not being able to *raise* my voice. I am also freeze-dominant though and have PTSD connected to loud noises, so that reaction just makes sense."

CPTSD,fhjebbq,t3_f3iq3a,1581644072.0,"Yep, same boat. Always felt like I was hypersensitive to almost all senses, not just noise. In general, anything above a certain threshold drives me mad, but noise in particular is the worst - especially footsteps (i.e. people walking around). Even though I've suspected it about myself, autism has also been ruled out several times including during childhood testing. (And all of my peers vehemently claim I'm not autistic, every single time I bring up the topic - including the people with asperger's that I've dated)

I think the noise issue in particular might be somewhat ""inherited"" from my father. He has CPTSD and noise-related hypervigilance, and my mother is an extremely hyperactive/noisy person which stresses out the both of us. He constantly attacks/ridicules her for it. I just withdraw or try and ignore it. There's also a bit of a hypervigilance component in myself because I noticed that it gets worse if I don't feel ""safe"", i.e. if I fear somebody coming into my room, I'll be unable to stop paying attention to the background noises.

But apart from that, I've also always been hypersensitive to taste/smell (and have had a very restrictive diet / food anxiety for the majority of my life), touch (clothing tags etc. drive me mad, I also get constantly bothered by my own hairs and e.g. can't wear headphones because of it) and vision (spent most of my youth in a pitch black room; being outside physically hurts me due to how bright it is and I usually have to squint. My friends used to poke fun at it). I remember being bullied for it as a kid, e.g. by my parents and siblings making fun of me for having to leave the room whenever there was a particularly strong scent present; which I think help contributed to my food anxiety. I didn't want to try anything new, as a *resistance* against them making fun of me for having such a restrictive diet.

I learned about something called [HSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_processing_sensitivity), which increases both emotional reactivity and sensory processing sensitivity, without being linked to autism. My mother says I matched the description of HSP to a t, even when I was a child; and in fact she's the one who claimed I had it, even before I consciously started paying attention to it. HSP is said to be an overactivity of the amygdala, i.e. a failure of the brain to properly manage emotional stress/fear - which in the case of senses, means we have trouble processing the stress of sensory stimulation. My gut instinct tells me that HSP and CPTSD might be connected somehow, though I'm not sure in which way."
