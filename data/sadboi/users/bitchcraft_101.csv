Expelling physical energy is really important for me when it comes to avoiding damaging behaviors. I got into the unfortunate habit of throwing and breaking things, which feels good in the moment but I regret it pretty soon after, given that one of my own posessions is now broken (especially since I rarely have the money to replace damaged things). 

I hope you're managing okay with everything that's going on in the world at the moment :) stay safe!"

BPD,flo4cx0,t3_fq0m7t,1585331382.0,"Personally, when I can put a name to something, it makes the whole thing seem a lot smaller and more manageable. It's like being afraid of the dark. When you can't see, the hulking black mass in the corner of the room is pretty damn scary. But when you turn on the light, you can see it's just a pile of laundry, and you can come up with a solution to take care of it and make the dark a little less scary. 

A proper diagnosis can also shed some light on what you can do to manage symptoms. Like HopeOfLight said, the internet can be really helpful in discovering healthy coping mechanisms, if you look in the right places. Just take everything with a grain of salt and know that although there are commonalities, not all coping mechanisms work the same way for everyone.

Good luck and be safe!"

I was just kind of milling around aimlessly when this girl comes over to me, calls me by the wrong name and asks if I want to play a game of pong with her and her friends. I was about to tell her that she mistook me for someone else when she leaned in and told me that there was a guy following me that kept eyeing my drink and trying to get closer to me. I put my drink down and linked arms with her and went and played pong with her and her friends until one of the people I came with finally found me. We swapped numbers at the end of the night, and that's how I met my best friend."

AskReddit,fh7hzfs,t3_f1irzw,1581332806.0,"I most certainly am not one of these people, but I do have a tip. I like to count my breaths (inhale is 1, exhale 2, etc until I get to ten and then start over) and visualize drawing the numbers in the sand on a beach. If my mind wanders, I label whatever I'm thinking of as either a thought, feeling or memory and then return my focus to my breathing. 

I learned it from Headspace, which I also highly recommend. It has these things called sleepcasts that will walk you through a relaxation exercise and then narrate a ""scene"" that you can listen to and use as an anchoring point. My personal favorite is Rainday Antiques. If you want an annual membership for significantly less money, just Google ""Headspace student membership"" and you can sign up for only $10 a year as opposed to $70. Sleep well amigos"

So I do my best to just apologize and try to explain why it's me and not anything he's doing, but his own anxiety and self confidence issues won't let him accept that it's not his fault. Which then makes me feel even more guilty and get more emotional, which results in him blaming himself more, and it's this big awful cycle of guilt and self deprecation. It sucks and I'm tired of being dehydrated from crying so much."

I know you're not trying to be manipulative and I'm sure they do too, but sometimes the things we say and do can end up being manipulative and at the very least unhealthy for the people around us. 

I struggle a lot with this as well. I have very bad timing when it comes to talking about my emotions and I'm never trying to hurt the people I'm talking to, but sometimes it just...happens. Currently I'm trying to train myself into toning it down to saying something along the lines of ""hey, I just wanted to let you know that I'm really not in a good frame of mind right now, but I'm doing my best to manage it and if it gets too much I will reach out to people who can get me help"" (i.e. a crisis line, going to the emergency room, etc). I've found that this is a better way to keep people ""in the loop"" and keep myself from stuffing things down, but not overwhelming the person I'm talking to.
