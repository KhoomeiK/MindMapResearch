TheLastAirbender,fr4bjlu,t3_gmb2vv,1589882750.0,"Avatar has taught me a few things and this post is a wonderful view of that. I see the chat has exploded with opinions and that's pretty cool. I think the important thing for people to remember is everyone is different. And if you don't agree that doesn't mean it's not someone else's 'Truth'. I used to have the hipster mentality mentioned too, but it's quelled with time and focusing on the positives of sharing and connection. I think it comes from feeling deeply attached to a show because if lots of people knew about it, it would change it. Truth is, that show is always changing as you change. What it means to you will be different everytime you go back to it. That's why I LOVE revisiting old art I used to enjoy."

And it just makes this twisted fake selfish deal. I think what you are describing is a particular instance where things went well for you. The beauty is in the spontaneity and you and your partner syncing up and making you feel wonderful because of who you were and who they were and it should be cherished. But it's also over and that's part of its beauty. The next thing should be handled as a unique thing that could or could not be just as or more beautiful."

Honestly, he seems like a vile man, and I'm sorry you had to deal with these things. But please don't blame yourself. If he loved you and wanted to be the best partner and dad he could, he wouldn't  have said any of these things and taken responsibility.

You said it's not, but posting about it means it's on your mind. I don't think fantasizing about someone else while having sex with your partner is right though. 2 things you can try. 1: be honest with your boyfriend and yourself about this. As how important desire is to your relationships. If you can't see it long term, then it may be time to call it quits. It's not fair on your partner if you know it won't last. 2: try to be mindful when having sex with your partner. Really focus on the here and now while having sex and if it's still not doing it, then it's an issue. 

I know this is a heavy, but you gotta think about the long term with relationships. Hope this helps in anyway. I wish you the best!"

I never thought I was into gossip, but when I really thought about it, I did it more than I liked in subconscious ways. I've tired to cut it out and if I have an issue, to address with the person mentioned. For example, if someone says ""oh, man. 'X' can be so high strung.""

She had strong points and shared some real interesting things with me too. Just care about who you are talking with, and I think it will fall into place.
