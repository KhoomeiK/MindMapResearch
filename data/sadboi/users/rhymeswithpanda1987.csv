Severely depressed, and battling a lifelong food addiction/eating disorder. I never know if I'm going to binge, so I exercise 3-4 hours a day. My life is my desk job and moving the rest of the time, at the gym doing HIIT or long walks. 

 I know I've had a week that looked like this recently: Sunday, binged, probably 5-7,000 calories. Monday, snacked too much because of sugar addiction from the binge. Probably 2500-3000. The rest of the week, closer to 1300 calories, every morsel tracked--including sugar free gum, cilantro etc.  TDEE according to my fitbit ranges from 3,000-3,700 calories because I exercise EVERY DAY no matter what. 

I'd like to lose 30 more pounds, but until I fix this eating disorder, the above is how maintenance looks for me. If I stop tracking for more than 2 days a week, even though most of my meals are lean protein and green veggies, I gain.  Even with all the exercise. 

It's really just science. 

Currently I'm just trying to track what I eat without restricting, but staying away from all non-fresh fruit sugar. That's what keeps me from bingeing. 6 days binge free.

First of all, congrats! My sober birthday is March 13th, 2017, so I'll have 3 years soon. My daily cocktail looked like yours, minus the heroin. (So grateful I never tried the stuff.) 

I have a question for you! I'm struggling with depression/finding joy in life. When I got sober, my food addiction took over. I gained a ton of weight, but have now lost over 100, but struggling with food addiction and exercise addiction, and I feel like it's taken over my life. (I feel that way because it has.)

I often wonder if this is any better, and sometimes I think about going back to uppers (doctor prescribed) because the food stuff is just so hard.

I, too, struggle with constant hunger.

Things that have helped me:

Drinking a ton of water.

Eating VERY slowly. Like, almost making it a competition with myself to see how long I can make my meal last. Savoring each bite. (I struggle with not being able to tell the difference between physical and psychological hunger after a literal lifetime of dieting.)

AVOID SUGAR/FAKE SUGAR and simple carbs. They spike your blood sugar and it leads to cravings. EDIT: Artificial sweeteners/sugar alcohols won't necessarily spike your blood sugar, but they make your brain think you've gotten sugar, and when your body doesn't get it, it tells you to go find it.

It's easier said than done, I'm NOT ready to stop with artificial sweeteners, but I know that's what it's going to take eventually to stop the insanity, because when I avoid them, it's like...boom. Constant hunger GONE.

I live every day counting every calorie and exercising every single free second that I'm not at my desk at work because this cycle has me not trusting myself. If my boyfriend brings home foods that are not on my ""safe"" list, I never know if I will be able to control myself. It's terrifying. It's taken over my life."
