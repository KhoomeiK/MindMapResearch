Another thing that helped was that during the transition, I told myself that if I had those alternatives but I was still craving the actual non vegan foods, I would have it. So far, all my cravings were curbed with the alternatives. 
I think it's because after a while and when you educate yourself, you start to see non vegan food as ""not food"". Meat (as in, a steak or a chicken leg) is definitely disgusting to me now and I don't want to eat it! And almost everything can be replicated with spices and seasonings!"
