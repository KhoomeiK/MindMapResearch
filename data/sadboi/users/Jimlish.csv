Even with the stuff I just mentioned, toxic department culture can really make things rough. 

Make sure you know folks who are in your current (grad program of any sort) situation, not just new professors or other friends so you can get venting/solidarity/specific emotional support. Get a hobby (honestly, supporting the college sports teams is oddly helpful if there are no pro teams because it is entertaining and part of a totally unconnected to your studies culture that is affordable) board games, running, whatever works for you. Having a pet is also very good (probably a cat because taking care of a dog is a shitload of work)."

That short time away did nothing to lessen the love and respect for the Captain when he came back and then retired. 

It also reminds me more recently and appropriately of Dwyane Wade (who Miami Dade county ceremonially renames itself Miami Wade County for once a year) who was in a similar situation with the Heat a few years ago. The team chose not to resign him for the amount he was worth on the open market, so he left for a couple of years before returning for one final season for a proper good bye. It was weird to see him in a bulls uniform, but ultimately it was a smart move and it did not cause our appreciation of him, nor his appreciation for the city, to lessen. 

If Hank were to waive his no-move clause and then sign a ceremonial contract to retire a Ranger, it wouldn’t be the strangest thing. For what it’s worth, I’d rather that not happen so I can maybe see him play as a Ranger one more time."
