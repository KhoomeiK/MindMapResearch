I’d start applying for jobs and try to change your mindset. I think people tend to self fulfill there prophecies so the “he’s going to leave me” mindset can’t lead anywhere good.

relationship_advice,fg2lbt7,t3_ewj5i9,1580447312.0,Sounds like he has an anxious attachment style. I’d try letting him know you care about him and everything is fine but you need alone time to recharge. Maybe see if there is any specific reassurance he needs before you get your alone time
relationship_advice,fg2kwlx,t3_ewj61b,1580447047.0,"I don’t think there’s any harm in putting what you want out there. If you don’t try, you’ll never know. Worst case you end up splitting which it sounds like is already the case"
relationships,fawae1a,t3_eapxj6,1576368163.0,"As far as attachment styles go people usually fall into three categories (brief summary a lot more to it) 
Secure style basically accepts intimacy and gives intimacy 
Anxious attachment basically needs a lot of reassurance and craves a lot of intimacy in a relationship but is always wondering if there partner really cares/ they feel like they care more 
Avoidant: has trouble accepting intimacy, tends to see people who need more reassurance as “needy” and tends to withdraw 

Obviously I don’t know either of you well enough but to me the whole “using heart emojis is cheesy” as well as other stuff made her seem avoidant to me. Also, the fact that when you brought these issues up to her she ended the relationship instead of working on it.

By intimacy issues I mean you guys seem to expect different levels of intimacy in a relationship, it seems like you crave more affection and closeness than her but again, this is just based off the post. When someone wants a lot of intimacy and emotional closeness with their partner and the partner doesn’t it’s kind of a hard issue to resolve.

As far as no contact that is a hard one as it’s kinda person to person basis and what you feel comfortable with. I’d tell her up front that this has been hard for you and it’s been a month so you need to move on and can’t speak but that maybe the door is still open for a relationship if she moves where you are at some point but until then both of y’all do your own things.

Also a good piece of advice I’ve gotten is “if it’s not a fuck yes then it is a no”."
relationships,faw4u2w,t3_eapxj6,1576365963.0,"Honestly the no contact rule might help. By still talking to her you’re giving her access to you so she probably feels like she can have you whenever she wants. She hasn’t truly had a chance to miss you yet. 

And I know exactly how you feel on the not getting to experience things together yet. When you first start dating someone you tend to idealize them, so when things that are just beginning ends it almost hurts more cause the relationship didn’t have time to play out/ you aren’t aware of all their flaws. It sounds like you guys were having intimacy issues which can be a pretty hard thing to fix in a relationship. I recommend looking Into attachment styles, it has helped me to be more aware of what I need in a relationship. 

Try and go out with friends, do things that you love, and get back into school. I know it’s so hard but doing these things will eventually feel better where as if you isolate and get behind all of it will catch up to you - either way the bad break up feelings are there it’s just whether you’re going to have more problems. Look into getting a therapist! It definitely helps to get an outside perspective. Also, what I do when I’m trying to stop thinking about someone is picture a big red stop sign every time my mind wanders to them, and if I know I’m going to have a big chunk of time I’ll try to do something active or with friends.

I hope this helps and remember you deserve someone who’s gonna think the sun shines out of your ass and is gonna do whatever they can just to see you smile."

SuicideWatch,famz7ml,t3_e8gjky,1576217530.0,"I can’t imagine what you’re going through. I’m so sorry this happened. I wish there was something I could do to help, or to take your hurt away, but all I can say is to look into getting a therapist and maybe a victims advocate. There might be ways to get out of your lease or get victims compensation. Please remember you’re not alone. You’re not any less of a person or man for what happened. I’m not going to lie to you, it is a long road to recovery after trauma like this... but speaking from personal experience it does get better, even if it doesn’t feel like that right now. After my past trauma it was really hard for me to see the world or other people as good,(I just felt like shit) but I promise there is still good out there. I care. I know I don’t know you, but I care. Please seek help. I know it is so hard but sharing this on here - or at all is such a big step. I hope your family or friends that you trust can be a support system for you right now. 

As far as what your girlfriend said, it was insensitive and I don’t want to justify it but she’s probably traumatized, confused, and doesn’t know how to handle the situation. She might be weird about physical contact because some people don’t like to be touched and she might not know how to comfort you in a way that makes you feel safe and supported. 

I really wish I could make things better for you, please know I’ll be sending love your way."

Don’t be afraid of sounding too needy, the worst case scenario is she doesn’t want what you want so you can move on but at least then you’ll have an answer. Plus if you want more/ aren’t getting your needs met why are you letting her set the tone of your relationship? Just food for thought as your needs are just as important as whoever your with!"
relationship_advice,f58tork,t3_dmwfy4,1572063809.0,I was 6 when my Dad moved to a different state and I had his number memorized and would call him on the home phone. I was begging to live with him by age 7. It might be a manipulation tactic by your ex but I believe the little girl really loves you and it would probably mean the world to her if you tried to see her or something along those lines.
