DodgeDakota,fqzptbv,t3_glrrg4,1589772624.0,I'm running 285/75/16 and I only just barely rub on frame and full lock when the wheel is under pressure like a curb or something I have a 3 inch body lift but am convinced without it I would not rub on body.
DodgeDakota,fqz2r8z,t1_fq31vwt,1589758869.0,What suspension lift did you put

HuntShowdown,fqncmm6,t3_gjf36w,1589492485.0,I agree thought I was being dumb but I've been making shots that would have killed before but are not now and like they should have reasonably made the kill I just built a new PC so I thought for some reason that it was me.

climbharder,fka5lzg,t3_fh4t6c,1583993378.0,I'd say less hang board more climbing you don't really need hang board till you have really progressed I climb v9/10 area on a good day and have not used a campus board yet not as much strength is needed as technique skip the board day and just climb more boulders of every style try climbing them multiple ways you need to learn how your body reacts to certain movements. Then again I don't really know much about coaching so

klr650,ewva4yh,t3_cq6b4i,1565801966.0,"This is the add description 

Overall in good shape with a few accessories installed and spare parts included. Comes with the clymer service manual. And a copy of proficient motorcycling if you want it. I'm including the furry rug seat cover as the original KLR seat is notoriously uncomfortable, the seat underneath is in pristine condition. I have maintenance records going back to 2005 from the previous owner and myself included. Various dings and scratches accumulated over the years in the bush, mostly from the previous owner. Nothing that affects use. This bike has been incredibly reliable for me. I am selling the bike as I no longer ride it. I'm focusing on building a family and adventure riding is no longer in the picture for now. I know if I let it sit it will deteriorate, so I'm ready to pass it on for someone else to enjoy. I mostly did long distance road trips with some forest service road adventures in between. 

I purchased this in Nelson BC in 2014 to get started in adventure riding. It was my first vehicle ever and first time riding a motorcycle too. At 5'11 I had zero issues with height, weight or power. I wanted something reliable, that could eat up highway miles and dirt roads alike. It's easy to self service, parts are ubiquitous around the world. It is now sitting at 70,542 KM after my last road trip from Vernon to Valemount (roughly 870 km round trip). I parked it after this in August of 2018. After a full battery charge it started up no problem 4/14/2019 (comes with a battery tender included). Stored with a full tank of gas to prevent rust, but it is getting old. I just changed the oil in preparation to sell (with new filter). I did not clean the air filter as it looked decent. It uses a K&N air filter that can be removed and cleaned. Tires pumped to pressure 22PSI front and rear. The heidenau k60 scouts installed are quite worn and would likely need replacement if you plan to do serious offroading. Fine for highway and dirt roads however.

The doohickey was done by the previous owner. And I upgraded the shift lever to a slightly longer one to better accommodate motocross boots, it's sturdier as well. The dash hi-beam indicator bulb is burnt out, but the neutral indicator and signal indicator light up.

I have been on several long distance road trips (eg. to Vancouver, Salt Spring Island, Tofino, Alberta etc. and back to the Kootenays) and have never noticed excess oil use. I'm sure it burns oil as most KLRs do but I've never seen it low when I changed it. I've done oil changes roughly every 5000 KM and every spring regardless of KMs. I always used full synthetic oil as well.

Most recent service I performed was taking the carburetor apart for a cleaning back in 2017. It was in great shape but I cleaned it out anyway as I had gone through the effort of taking it apart. The brake fluid was also replaced at this time.

I also have a video of it starting up the first time since I parked it, and a video of it starting up shortly after that while ""warm."" There is also a 360 walk-around. This is on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RssI27Ufpi4
