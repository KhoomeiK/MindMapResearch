mentalhealth,fr3lq95,t1_fr3l5ul,1589860196.0,"Oh, either way, don’t worry about that, love! Like I said, everything in high school is magnified in your mind. In the grand scheme of things, this won’t matter. I hope that doesn’t sound like I’m diminishing your emotions, but really, especially at that age, people don’t know how to express themselves. She was looking for an out (which hurts enough in itself) and she chose the shitty, immature route of slandering you instead of being straight up with you. I promise it will be okay. You’re a good kid. Keep your head up."
Depop,fr3jaly,t3_gmg0hd,1589858627.0,"I wish they’d just pick cool things that are unique. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been featured before a few times cause my item was within their “theme” which is cool, but as a buyer as well, I’d like a little more effort and variety put into what gets featured. There’s so many cool items for sale that no one sees because they’re too busy picking items that fit in with said themes."

Either way, life goes on and people forget about things like these. There’s way worse men out there who do much worse things than request nudes. You’re in high school, and things seem much more magnified because you’re stuck surrounded by the same people day in and out. It’s okay to be upset or embarrassed, but in the long run, you will probably laugh about this in the future, hun. I was traumatized in high school but it made me stronger and all the trauma made me forget most of it anyways lol"

I put the item in the washer, came out fine, put it in the dryer, comes out with these dark splatter marks all over it I was like WTF 😭😭 I think the motor on my dryer spit oil out or something, honestly have no idea cause it hasn’t damaged anything since. anyways, spent all day trying to clean it and they were corduroy so i got them cleaned up sort of but sorta messed up the fabric with my scrubbing, felt horrible, messaged the buyer asking if they’d like a refund or like to see pictures of them now for a partial refund or whatever they wanted and they were SOOOO nice about it and said they didn’t want any refund or pictures and they’d still accept them. I sent them 2 free tank tops, candy, makeup and nail polish with their item because they made my day with their kindness and ended my stressing out. Just be honest with your buyer, send them pictures if they request them and they’ll appreciate your communication and honesty, and if they don’t want them, take the L and learn your lesson to always wash stuff before listing because that’s what I had to learn 😫"

I had a gold label bodysuit that I had listed for 30, someone ended up paying $45 for it because they asked me to hold it for 2 weeks.

So give it some time and they should eventually scan. This is why I wait in line no matter what now. It guarantees me that scan within 24 hours so I can have peace of mind."

Depop,fqks7zh,t3_gjftgq,1589434819.0,I’ve seen this same exact message posted to this subreddit before not even that long ago. Wonder if they just send the same message over and over to multiple ppl trying to grab blazers for $5 a piece 😂
Mercari,fqjgowq,t1_fqjfqe2,1589409690.0,"Yes, it’s really unfair sometimes. They should have a way to dispute since their only explanation is that the “good reviews will outweigh the bad”.

Depop,fqjg0mn,t3_giwzui,1589409420.0,"I think most of us are having the exact same issues :( I’m glad I did a good heap of sourcing before covid but it’s been quite a while now and finding new inventory is really hard. I did find a few really great deals on shoe lots on eBay but I’ve now been waiting over 2 weeks for them to get to me and my shop is currently dry af besides one bulk buy from a vintage wholesale company that was okay. I bought it by weight so had no idea what I was getting, but it was cheap (about 3.50 per item). There was a few things that have sold and some that have interest but the other stuff is just alright 🤷🏻‍♀️ not to mention that I pride my shop on being handpicked and wholesale is not handpicked but I have no choice rn 😭"
Mercari,fqjei2w,t1_fqjda0c,1589408810.0,"Yeah, I’m hoping she will care enough to actually reach out and get it changed. It’s not really having one 3 star rating that bugs me, it’s the principle. If I had done something wrong I would understand and take the review. Even then, I feel like a message explaining their concerns before rating poorly would be more appropriate. Some people are just inconsiderate, which I realize as well 😒 as a seller, the power isn’t in your hands. This is why I prefer depop as a seller, you can see their rating before you rate them back. Though, retaliation reviews really aren’t helpful either. But it does help me feel more protected and that people will review more fairly knowing you can rate them back the same."
Mercari,fqjd5x7,t1_fqjcvft,1589408274.0,Exactly. I’m frustrated because she even admitted to me in messages AFTER the fact that nothing was my fault. And I’m also curious how “crushed” it is for being a soft coin purse that was packaged well.

Depop,fqfnai3,t1_fqezdra,1589327997.0,Thank you! I actually just used it for the first time the other day because I gave free shipping for a bundle and depop stupidly doesn’t combine your shipping on bundles but just makes you pay for both shipping labels. I really like it so far!

Depop,fqa7f5r,t3_ghpv8k,1589214146.0,I’ve gotten a few messages like this now and I was confused at first too lol the first one I responded “I can ship out for you tomorrow if you choose to buy!”.... no response. The second one I said “if you’re interested I can give you a discount” and that led to a sale lol and the convo ended with her telling me it was her first purchase on depop so I think it might be people who aren’t that familiar with depop.

Depop,fq1d0sc,t1_fq1cf72,1589044529.0,"Okay, yeah I do have a scale so I usually weigh my stuff when I’m listing so I know what to use to ship with depop, but the address thing had me confused cause I was wondering how I could know what to put for the shipping cost if I didn’t know where I’d be shipping to beforehand/if that made a difference in what the cost would be.

Depop,fpsq83s,t1_fpspoak,1588877759.0,"Yeah I don’t do free shipping on depop for a couple reasons. One - I feel like it attracts low ballers. It’s almost like they think wow, what a good deal, I bet I can get them to go EVEN lower. Two - I don’t feel like it deters people from buying. My Pm and mercari accounts are my old clothes I don’t want anymore so I do free ship on mercari to get people to take the stuff off my hands a little easier, but my depop is curated vintage that I hand pick and spend A LOT of time styling and getting nice modeled pictures so I honestly overprice to allow a little wiggle room but I’m certainly not giving it away. People really do be crazy and I think overpricing a little keeps the low ballers far far away, and meanwhile, some people will just come thru and buy without saying a word or even asking for a discount. They’re my favorite kind of buyers!"
Depop,fpsp5vv,t3_gfavrz,1588877248.0,"This shit makes me want to scream. I had a lady the other day on mercari haggle with me over literally a dollar when I had told her the lowest I was willing to go till I stopped answering her. She then proceeded to send me an official offer thru the app for the DOLLAR LESS than my lowest that I said I wouldn’t take then kept messaging me asking if I was gonna accept her offer. I said no, I told you my lowest. So she finally goes “ok I’ll do it, and I need it by Saturday for Mother’s Day”.... well honey if you hadn’t haggled for 2 days that might have been able to happen for you! It seems petty but as a seller you have to stand your ground or people will literally just get whatever they can out of you as if the time u put into listings and the fees and free fucking shipping you’re covering don’t exist."

Beauty is subjective, and I can’t see you but I know you’re not ugly. You have a whole heart and soul. You know you’re not ugly, so eff him for saying that. If he’s constantly saying that he is a good dad, it’s probably him projecting, trying to convince you because he knows how you feel about him. I hope your situation gets better. I’m sure he loves you, some parents are just so ignorant to their kids feelings and it can be very detrimental to their mental health. I’ve been through similar. When you’re older, everything will come full circle and you’ll be more at peace with your relationship with him. I know that probably doesn’t help you right now, but hang in there."

Depop,fo8k563,t3_g66jxr,1587598129.0,These are super fuckin dope but I wouldn’t spend 800 on literally anything... except rent 😪
Depop,fo5qwji,t3_g5ui30,1587532934.0,This is what brandy melville wants you to think about yourself :( this girl is probably very young and comparing herself to all her friends who wear these clothes. I feel so bad for her.
Depop,fny8hz0,t3_g4fbjz,1587356047.0,Congrats! ❤️
Depop,fnwzuim,t3_g4cwwb,1587328714.0,I don’t think this persons actually a drop shipper. They model all their clothes themselves and their descriptions could be old and just keep refreshing them. 🤷🏻‍♀️ but idk lol
