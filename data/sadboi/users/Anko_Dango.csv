London has Fallen. My lord, an even more convoluted, unrealistic plot. Still had cool action.

Angel has fallen? What the heck? Even shittier plot. Why in the world would anyone believe the man who saved the president TWICE would be out to assassinate him? Action still cool.

Can't wait for ""Liberty Has Fallen"" for when the entire U.S is invaded by Russia, and the President is blamed for being a part of it, so Mike has to protect him from not only Russian forces, but US intelligence too.  Or some shit like that."
