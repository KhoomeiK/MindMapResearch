depression,f4tlhtv,t3_dlfw2v,1571790216.0,"Same here OP. I am 23, jobless and dropped out of school. I'm alive just because people would suffer from my death but if left alone I'd kill myself for sure.
I wasted my whole life so far and I have no possibility of a decent future, but what bothers me is that I still belive in my old dream and I still hope to give a meaning to my life.
Right now I'm trying to destroy both of them so I can give up and live trying to look normal to not disappoint my family.
I know I lost the point of this post along the way and it's niw a useless mess, but I kinda wanted to open myself even if I ended up looking and feeling like an idiot."
