Is that likely what is going on here? Maybe in previous years (when I lived in a more expensive area) the mortgage interest was more than the standard deduction?"

It still has _some_ caffeine, but less than regular coffee."

Psychonaut,ez8f2o4,t3_d00pz4,1567741553.0,"I’m a software developer as well. Well, mainly a teacher and less of a developer these days, but still similar work. The best approach is different for each person. Personally, I really enjoy the creativity involved in programming and solving different types of problems. If you enjoy the field but not your current job, then I would recommend looking for something within the programming field that can quench any newfound creativity and guide your skills in the direction of your passions in life. I currently work remotely and got a place out in the woods and am loving it. Yes, there are days where I spend more time on the computer than I’d like, but I also have plenty of time for camping, fishing, hiking, and those types of things. I believe I’ve found a perfect balance that works for me where I love my work and I also love my free time. Again, this will be different for each person. If you don’t believe you’ll enjoy programming and have passions elsewhere then by all means you should pursue your desires in life. Life is too short not to. But this is a balance that has worked very well for me. Best of luck with whatever you decide. Best wishes!"
