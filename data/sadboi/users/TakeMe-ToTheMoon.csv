I get it too, but I wasn't and still am not a huge dick about it when my brother wanted to live on my island despite my love for AC."
AmItheAsshole,fk81kx3,t1_fk80q5o,1583947634.0,That's just about the island per switch. It literally says your island can have 8 residents on a shared island if they have nintendo accounts.
audible,fdcl2ph,t3_ekjwag,1578277570.0,Red Rising trilogy is what I'm currently listening to. There's the first trilogy and then there's two books out in the second trilogy. I'm about to finish book two and it's really good! The narrator is awesome. Its a sci-fi/dystopian series! I highly recommend it!

And if so, is he available right now? Or only during the Gala (if he's even available then)?

My might is over 19k but not quite 20k :(
Which is why I really feel this should be able to be beaten."

DragaliaLost,fbdx10d,t3_ectnnk,1576773239.0,"I posted a couple days ago about beating nightmare and with a few people's suggestions (H!Lowen or N!Aeleen, S!Julietta and Elly over Lily) I've gotten closer to beating it. Yesterday I got the boss down to around 10% but ran out of time. 

Today I'm finding I can only get him to between 30-50% before time runs out. I have Xander with the force strike print and my yule tree is at level 33. I always get to the boss with about 2 minutes left but don't break for like a minute. I feel like I should be able to beat this but I just can't seem to. I'm getting really frustrated and don't know what else I can do, if anything.

Edit: I finally beat it guys!!! Thank you everyone for your suggestions! :')"

DragaliaLost,fb7wyta,t3_ebw864,1576601245.0,"I'm getting so frustrated trying to beat Nightmare. Im not sure where I'm going wrong, my AI keeps just dying in like 2 or 3 hits, or doesn't dodge at all. It seems like Thaniel barely heals?

I have Lily, Xander, Thaniel and I've used Elly/Orsem/S!Julietta in the last spot, but nothing has worked. I've only made it to about 80% of the bosses health before everyone dies (if they even live that far). 

I have that striker print on Xander and force strike through the first 3 waves, but then wave 4 comes and my AI usually starts dropping or I'll get hit while trying to dodge and it's half my health. I try to keep them out of the middle too but it feels hopeless.

Any advice?"
