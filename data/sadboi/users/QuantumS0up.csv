dankruto,fpofsii,t1_fpnqp3d,1588783763.0,"Honestly I like Sasuke because he's kind of relatable for me. Which sounds far fetched, but hear me out lol. For like my entire childhood until my 20s pretty much I was mentally ill and pushed everyone I cared about away, I was self destructive, nihilist, traumatized, etc. And I'd given up on myself just like Sasuke had towards the end of the war. It was only thanks to my loved one's persistence that I came around. So like, yeah Sasuke is not a typical character to come to mind in terms of ""wow so relatable"" but at a base level and without all the theatrics and ninja shit I think there are some themes that could resonate with a lot of people. 

Trauma changes you and makes you say and do things that are irrational and out of character. Not an excuse for tryna kill your friends, but yeah. Sasuke wasn't evil, he was just lost and traumatized."

That said, therapy is extremely important. I understand that trauma therapy is hard, but confronting those memories is the only way to move forwards with them. Judging by the post and some of your comment replies, I have to agree that it sounds like she doesn't want to get better. I think it would be very valuable - if possible - to try and get her to either explain, or at least contemplate on her own WHY that is.

There are very few reasons not to get better, and the reasons that do exist are almost always some manifestation of low self-worth. E.g., I don't deserve to get better, I don't deserve to live or be happy, I'm too broken to be fixed. And occasionally, depending on how long a person has been living in this volatile state, fear of successfully managing. It might sound ridiculous, but stability can be an unknown and something very hard to imagine. 

Our mental illness is only one part of us, but unfortunately in some cases it consumes our identity. Not in an outwardly expressed way - I'm not talking about like, tattooing 'psycho' on your forehead or posting dramatic things on facebook - I mean to say that it completely controls our responses to and personal philosophy regarding life in general. 

An example from my own life would be how in high school when I had anorexia, I refused to recover because as a former fat kid I was now a 'glow up' and 'skinny'. I became the embodiment of a sad girl trope, going so far as intentionally blocking out optimism and actively trying to forget about happy memories, and became a very negative person; completely the opposite of my nature, because after being depressed for almost 8 years I had genuinely forgotten how to act otherwise. What would I do with my time if I wasn't constantly engaging in some form of escapism?

Anyways, all of this to say that there IS hope when proper action is taken. I wish the best for your wife and for yourself; you both deserve better. She shouldn't have to live like that, and neither should you or your child. You can't recover for her, so stay strong, lean on your support network, and do your best - even if that means letting go at some point.

Edit: I also meant to add - having self medicated with alcohol myself, it it absolutely a no-go. Sobriety or bust. Additionally, if she were taking her medications, alcohol consumption pretty much renders them useless. I learned this the hard way and am still learning(I only turned 21 ten days ago). If nothing else, get rid of your alcohol. Prevent her from drinking as much as you can."

The story is my imagination, my fantasy, I'm writing it because its something I personally want to see happen - so, the lack of views don't bother me. They make sense too, considering the length. 

I'm at nearly 100k words 15 chapters in, and am only 1/3rd the way through the first major arc(chapters before were necessary set up and world/relationship building for the OC). My plot outline covers three time periods spanning almost 20 years, with four major arcs and complex subplots. Its a full-on novel lol. I don't doubt that it will end up being more than 500k - in fact, thats the minimum length I expect the full story to be. I'm a details person, and the plotline centers around a massive initial change/influence that alters 90% of the events of the rest of the series, and my story will cover all of the important changes.

NarutoFanfiction,fmjefeo,t3_fvja7i,1586128660.0,"This might be a stretch, but you could probably find a way to make this work using the Flying Thunder God: Guiding Thunder technique. 

""This barrier technique incorporates the use of theÂ Flying Thunder GodÂ formula to erect a barrier space capable of warping away anything that comes into contact with it. The subject of the technique is then directed to another location marked by the userâ€™s formula. The barrier has proven to be powerful enough to warp away techniques as destructive as aÂ Tailed Beast Ball.""

Edit to add: after reading more on it, I think I've found a solution. Since it is possible in the Naruto universe to alter and adapt jutsu, you theoretically could have a character reformulate the technique. You mentioned using a tag that you can place on an enemy's body; you're in luck, because barriers can be condensed into tags. So I guess, you could: mark enemy with hiraishin formula>  place sneaky space-time barrier tag(essentially sticking a portal to their ass)> activate the barrier and teleport them to any other location in which you have placed a hiraishin formula- including yourself. The only limitation you would run into would be the character's chakra, because the chakra requirement increases in proportion with two factors- the size of the target and the distance between the target, the user, and the end-point

Edit 2: sorry I keep adding stuff bc Im interested in this concept haha. I am pointing out the following to help with realism/situations involving very skilled and powerful enemies. 

One important thing to note about space-time barriers is that they can circumvent pretty much every other type of barrier...and also themselves. This would be an advantage to you in most scenarios against the majority of opponents. Unless, however, the victim you are teleporting also possess space-time ninjutsu abilities. Space-time barriers only create confines within the dimension they reside in, so space-time ninjutsu can bypass them by going into another dimension. 

For example, Kamui- lets say you placed your barrier tag on Obito Uchiha, intending to deposit him in a pit of lava. Well, if he were fast enough(a very real possiblity/he definitely is) he could bypass your barrier by warping into his own dimension during the very short time it would take for your jutsu to teleport him to the lava pit."

I picked Kamui intending to elaborate on that but forgot to. My bad for theory crafting right after waking. Thanks for pointing it out, otherwise people might've been mislead.

If you use the human body as an analogy, a kekkei genkai is like someone being a naturally gifted athlete. They have the genes and the potential, but still have to work and learn how to use their talents properly. Lebron James didn't come out of the womb knowing how to play basketball. On the contrary, a dojutsu is like- to use the most literal example, haha- your ability to see. If you have working eyeballs, you can see. You don't have to learn how to use your eyes. As soon as you are born with eyeballs you just know how to use them. The implicit understanding of 'how to see' will enable you to learn how to use what you are seeing to gather information and whatnot, but the act of seeing itself does not have to be learned."
NarutoFanfiction,fmbbkbn,t1_fmayb9y,1585922976.0,"This is the answer. Wielding chakra doesn't actually technically require using hand signs. However, having the level of mastery required to do so without the signs is something very few characters have attained. The same logic applies here with the seal placement/activation.

On the hand signs note, for an example of not needing them ever see Hagoromo, Hamura, Kaguya, or pretty much any other Otsutsuki. Indra Otsutsuki created hand signs because he was unable to freely mold his chakra like his father was, he lacked the skill & control required. So on one hand, it seems like this is an ability that someone can be born with, to varying degrees. On the other, it is up to individual skill. This is why we have some people who can perform a technique with 5 hand signs, and others who need 20 in order to use the same exact technique.

Other factors are whether or not a specific jutsu was created by the person using it, and the user's mastery level.  Ex: Naruto requires hand signs to use Six Paths abilities because they are Hagoromo's, not his, and he hasn't mastered them to the same degree. Another would be Hiraishin, the Flying Thunder God technique developed by Tobirama Senju. It does not require hand signs to place the formulas or to be activated. There literally are no hand signs to use, even if you wanted to. This is why using the jutsu requires an extremely high skill level and mastery of it. Something that seems to be pretty typical of all space-time ninjutsu. Another example of this is Kamui. Or, again, the Otsutsuki- whose species has chatacteristic/inherent space-time capabilities- not using or having ever developed the use of hand signs to do their wacko shit."

Summary: What would happen if an Otsutsuki clan defector came to Earth right after Pain's assault, swore to protect everyone to spite her insane family of evil assholes, and caused the neglected female characters to have meaningful character development? How will things change once humanity learns who their real enemy is and actually takes it seriously instead of dragging their feet while Sasuke molests ancient burial sites and ignores his family? Read this to find out. Ft. angst, love triangles, and bad humor. And angst. This is the kind of fix-it where the characters learn to fix things themselves. As in, they do what they should have fucking done in the first place, lol."

FanFiction,flq939e,t3_fq7tzn,1585384362.0,"I suppose its about time I embarass myself again. 

In 8th grade I wrote a fanfic that was a One Direction/Naruto/Twilight crossover, if you can even call it that. 

It starts with an OC female running into Niall in a starbucks. Like literally running into him. Hot coffee(carmel macchiato) spills on them both and they try to clean it up at the same time. They touch hands and she is transported to the Naruto Universe. What is OC's name? Why of course, she is named Renesmee, and is Renesmee Cullen who I was obsessed with after recently reading Breaking Dawn. Keep the Jacob & Renesmee ship in mind, it'll be important later.

Renesmee wakes up at Ichiraku and meets Naruto, and realizes that he is actually Niall Horan, he just doesn't know about his musical talent or that he is Niall Horan. So, she convinces him to start a band. Sasuke sings, Neji is on the keyboard, Rock Lee is an insert for Louis(bc at the time I thought they were both ugly and annoying lol) and is the bassist, and Naruto plays the drums. They call themselves....North. because when Renesme suggested the name ""one direction"" they thought she meant to pick a cardinal direction and make that the name. Then there is a love triangle between Renesme, Naruniall, and Sasuke that is introduced by one page of dialogue of them both saying versions of ""I love you, you're so cute, marry me"" trying to out-do the other. 

Renesmee chooses Naruto even though she and Sasuke had already kissed, so Sasuke leaves the band and signs a record deal with Orochimaru instead. Shikamaru replaces Sasuke(???). Orochimaru, CEO of Hidden Sound Records, makes Sasuke the lead of a band called Cursed. Sasuke hates the members and the music and misses North but he is Sasuke so won't go back. Renesmee sneaks out to a Cursed concert in the village(criminals are allowed back if its for a show) to see Sasuke because she's a thirsty ass hoe. Itachi's band, Akatsuki, is playing a set before Cursed. 

Akatsuki is made up of Itachi, Kisame, Hidan, and Pain, and they are an emo rock band. At the club(?) Hidan starts flirting with Renesmee, trying to get her to drink and then lures her to the bathroom intending to sacrifice her to Jashin. Itachi saves her and tells Hidan he is 'getting too into the music', whatever that means. Sasuke hears about everything and is furious. Before raging, he stops to kiss Renesmee and tell her he loves her. Then, because it is Sasuke, he kills Itachi. Not Hidan, the attempted murderer, but Itachi, since Itachi did kill their entire family. He tells himself that Hidan was just under a genjutsu and Itachi was the mastermind. After that Sasuke leaves Cursed and steals Itachi's band, basically.

I should mention that during all of this, Renesmee and Sakura are fighting over Sasuke, and Renesmee and Hinata over Naruto. They never use jutsu to fight, they just glare at eachother in public. I only gave Renesmee one jutsu at first: Ketsu no Jutsu. Think blood bending and then don't think of anything else because I just stole it from ATLA. 

Meanwhile, North and Akatsuki have a band battle, and Kisame uses his guitar Samehada to steal not just chakra, but musical talent. Kind of like the basketball in Space Jam. This is when we learn a major plot twist. Naruto is the Niall Horan jinchuriki. Yep. Sasuke isn't a music jinchuriki though, he is just naturally gifted. When they find out about Naruniall, Akatsuki unseals Niall and steals the Niall chakra, causing Naruto to look and act like canon Naruto. This means that Renesmee's british boyfriend is gone, basically dead. It is very traumatic, so Renesmee awakens her Mangekyou Sharingan. Like she just skips all the steps and goes straight to Mangekyou even though she never had normal sharingan. This is all possible thanks to the fact that her mom, Bella Swan, was Madara Uchiha's duaghter. How? Why? I don't know, because I never explained. So anyways, now Renesmee lost both of her boyfriends since she is related to Sasuke and they can't kiss anymore. They want to, but it is forbidden love.

The final scene is Renesmee running into a dog in the forest. Akamaru is the dog. Kiba, who she has somehow never met during all of this, comes running over to get Akamaru. They look at eachother and instantly know they are soulmates because Kiba is Jacob riencarnated. It ends with them staring into eachother's eyes. 


I turned this in for a creative writing project. It still keeps me up at night."

FanFiction,fledlsp,t3_fo4du6,1585082348.0,"Some of the best fics Ive read had less than 30 kudos and almost zero comments, and stats are never a factor in my decision to read or not. If the summary is interesting, the tags are exciting, and the first chapter leaves me wanting to know the rest of the story then thats all that matters. 

As for my own stories, I write for myself. Kudos and follows and what not are great but I don't expect them, and the only reason I publish at all is so that if someone does happen to like my writing they are able to enjoy it along with me."

AskReddit,flcmth2,t1_flc0uxd,1585037343.0,"My dad still isn't taking it seriously. 

I recently moved in with him and my step family, they constantly eat out(I dont, but only buy groceries for myself because of this so its not like I had been stocking extra), our pantry is full of spices. I bought a bunch of ramen and they have been using it to garnish brussels sprouts and salads. No non perishables, no rice, one half empty bag of flour. You get the picture. If there is a food shortage we are fucked. Since I take adderrall Ive gotten used to a measly diet and having one meal or less in a day. None of us are overweight and everyone is fit and active but they definitely are used to eating 3 meals and always having snacks available due to their activity levels(two teenage girls, step mom is a PE teacher/gym bunny). 

Anyways, I'm by no means in panic mode, but I'm taking this seriously and am reasonably worried. Similar to you, I tend to be scientifically inclined and analytical about things. I see the economy, I see the unemployment rate, I see the emptying store shelves, I understand basic human psychology and how quickly panic can turn normal sane people into unrecognizable versions of themselves, and thus I am aware of all the very different but very possible scenarios this could devolve into. But I can't even speak my mind because they will just ridicule me and say that everyone else is just crazy. Im 21 years old but I feel like the only realistic adult in this house right now. Thankfully if it actually gets bad I can move back with my logical mother and brothers to ride this out. 

Ironically, on a manic whim this past summer I ordered some of the army survival guides and taught myself how to find edible plants & potable water, basic medicine, first aid/cpr, all that good stuff. It came out of nowhere and I just had this intense feeling of 'I need to do this' that I couldn't shake until I scratched the itch. Bought a knife, compass, hammock. Reaaaallyy helpful stuff I know, but at least its something. Worst, like literally the worst-case scenario is that Im able to find us some good tree bark to add to our grass salads and grass tea, lol"

Fandom- Naruto, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations

Rating- Explicit

Title- Exegesis

Genre- Humor, Romance, Action

[AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/23175613/chapters/55472506) | [FFN](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13527164/1/Exegesis)

Summary: This is basically post-Pain's Assault Shippuden/Boruto, except if it were called ""Girl Power! Also, Otsutsukis are snake bitches."" instead. Neji lives, and it's all thanks to Aratashiki Otsutsuki- AKA Aratani Hoseki- and the concept of female empowerment that she introduces to the shinobi world. All shall fall before the P.O.P. Except for Sasuke, because in this story his closet has a glass door.

Fun facts: vanilla Neji is the worst HC, like ever.  My smut attempts to correct this gross miscalculation. Oh, and its Neji/OC female. Also, Daddy issues."

BipolarReddit,fktzw1r,t3_fkjk0t,1584539051.0,"That actually makes a lot of sense. I started experiencing typical depression/anxiety in like 5th grade, and then in 8th grade I experienced a minor trauma(death of a classmate, first time I had ever had family/friend die. Died nearly the exact way way Kobe did- engine fire in bonanza plane- I was a mess over Kobe for weeks). Then my freshmen year I had another minor truama(didnt realize it at the time) when I came out to my parents and they decided that the cure was to violate all of my privacy and monitor my social life and my personality, basically, by going through all of my messages every night and hounding me about them, long story short. That was beginning of 9th grade, and a few months later I had my first manic episode, but it only lasted a month and was not severe enough to cause concern. And then my friend committed suicide at the end of my 10th year, and after that all hell broke loose. So uh...yeah, I'd say trauma is definitely a trigger."

DecidingToBeBetter,fjh4lrt,t3_fda1a6,1583341131.0,"Wow. I was almost exactly like you in high school. I'm turning 21 in a month and just now started learning how to drive, due to the same crippling anxiety. I struggled with mental health from 11 as well, so around the same age, and felt exactly how you are feeling right now when I was 18. I also really struggled to talk about my issues with my family, and I completely understand what you mean when you say that you literally can't/its impossible even though you want to. 

Despite that, my biggest piece of advice right now would be to find a way to tell them, or anyone. Seriously do whatever it takes. The way I initially opened up about it was by just saying something along the lines of ""hey mom, I'm not feeling well"" and then taking the time for the conversation to naturally progress until she asked what was REALLY going on and I felt comfortable admitting that I was depressed. Unfortunately in my case, I did not accept help or put effort into recovery even though I had that conversation around 14. I never truly opened up until I wound up in a mental hospital after trying to commit suicide when I was 19 and I am only just recently beginning to get my life back on track. After getting treatment and medication things are SO much better. Like seriously, night and day. I never thought that living could feel like this. Never thought that I could actually have energy or a desire to experience life, period.

So don't make the same mistake I did. Reach out in ANY way you can. Please. Again, I completely understand how difficult it is and how impossible it feels. But I believe in you. You can do it. And I can guarantee you will regret it if you don't, and the pain and consequences from not doing so will far outweigh the few minutes of suffocating discomfort it takes to start that conversation. Even if, like I was, you are shaking and sweating and feeling like your heart is going to explode, just vomit the words out. Purge them. 

You can do this. Please don't let something that is 100% treatable derail your dream like I did. You deserve way better than that. There IS hope, and there IS a way out. Its hard work but completely doable. You're gonna go far, kid. :)"
