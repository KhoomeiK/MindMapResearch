So I set myself up kinda like I was meditating and visualized something similar to an interrogation room where I was the interrogator and B (still Her at this point) was being interrogated, and I visualized rules, like Her may only speak if what she has to say is helpful to the conversation etc and I started asking her very blunt questions, as the conversation went on the scene started to change to be more accommodating to Her so she was less like a prisoner and more like someone being interviewed  then so it was more like to acquainted people talking and so on. It took lliteral HOURS to get there and I cried like crazy at the end

I have always found when the voices are fucking around if I set my thoughts in like a military strength bluntness I can converse with them, even for a little bit."

I am so lucky to have amazing partners who treat any of my concerns as real untill we can prove otherwise, several times what I'm hearing/seeing/smelling is actually something that has needed to be addressed asap 

(minor example, I could smell what I thought was rotting meat for weeks, no one else seemed to notice so I tried to ignore it, got so overwhelmed I had to tell my partners, after a bit of looking around we discovered our septic system had malfunctioned and I was actually smelling what would have turned into a very expensive problem if it wasn't caught)

The thing that works for me is saying to my family something along the lines of ""I understand that this may be caused by psychosis, but I think it'd be really helpful to settle my mind if we could just check X"" it helped build a trust system so that I am more comfortable when they say its nothing.

schizophrenia,fgschoy,t3_f02cya,1581080380.0,"It can take weeks or even months to adjust to new medications, when I started my antipsychotics I had no thoughts, I felt like my  brain had just switched off entirely, it started leveling out after about 2 weeks for me. 

Nearly  2 years later and I'm on a much higher dose of the same antipsy's and have full autonomy and functionality of my life. 

I think its really important to talk to a professional  in the adjustment stage to get a gauge of whats expected and whats way out of left field. You absolutely can have negative side effects by stopping a med at any stage, but if you're 100% certain these arent for you then consult your Dr and discuss the process of stopping, at such an early stage I imagine it should be a fairly straightforward procedure.

schizophrenia,fgrg0kg,t1_fgpnoeo,1581045900.0,"Oh can I answer from my pov?

I have distinct 1st person voices that have become their own entire personalities, that can ""take over"" me. I DO NOT have split personality disorder, my specialist describe it as ""split personas"" however they can also talk to me as a third person voice, and talk to eachother.

I am not comfortable ""outing"" their names but I am happy to give an initial and a basic overview

* B, (formally known as Her) is the protector of my entire being, at one point Her was the driving force to my suicide attempts untill I sat and had an in depth conversation with her, during this conversation I laid out ground rules, and allowed her to 'teach me' my she was there. This is also when she named herself. B will smack a bitch if I'm in physical danger but can also tear shreds off a persons ego and self confidence. She loves hanging out with our drag queen friends because she can be playfully snarky with them without actually hurting anyone. B once hated H and wanted her gone, but has since taught me that this was from fear of H being hurt or taken advantage of by external forces, causing all of ""Us"" to be in danger. B is very protective of H but in a ""older sibling who hates you but would kill someone for looking at you"" type way. 

* H is my innocence, H doesn't swear and doesn't like violence at all. It is a hard limit. H is very child like and would be considered an ""age regression"" persona. H is also female. H is often ""in charge"" when I am manic but can also take control when I am in a deep depressive state to guide my mind into a more neutral state.

* Gremlin (I'm able to name gremlin because He never has any social media presence) is as his name suggests, a Gremlin. He comes out when I become over-manic and my brain is struggling to process which can lead to a drop. Gremlin is a base instict type situation, if I'm playing around while I'm manic Gremlin may take over and become a snarly little growl creature for a while untill I start processing better and can calm myself down with minimal dropping. G is my only distinctive Male persona and gets along with both B and H quite well"

Little bit of back story- my father hated me pretty much my whole life. No-one really knows why. He likes my 3 siblings well enough.

Because of this I didn't see any of the million red flags in my first 2 serious relationships. BF1 raped me about 3 months into the relationship then abused me physically and emotionally for 15 months until he got bored and dumped me. This sets the stage for BF2 who I'll call Mark.

I met Mark online a while before I turned 19. Mark is 9years older than me and charming as FUCK. 6ft10 very fit, and a complete narcissist. I was an open book to him and he was Gaslighting me from the get go. Overtime removed me from all friends and family.

When we eventually started a relationship Mark was so anti-drug he once got offended by me making a pot dealer joke and threatened to make me walk home. Mark didn't work but always had cash. 

Flash forward a few months and I find out Mark is infact a drug dealer- but its okay cause its just pot, and he used to be big time into Ice but was 'clean' now. Sounds good to me, I stupidly move in with him (Gaslighting is fucking horrible fyi) but tell him if he ever touches Ice again I'd be done. 

Skip forward to the end of the relationship. I had been unhappy for a while. We always fought and I was finally ready to admit he had been beating me etc.
I reached out to my sister for the first time in nearly a year. I give her the basic run down of what was happening (minus the physical violence because I'm an idiot) and tell her I'm ending it, she tells me she's known for a long time and is 100% here to support me.

I go home and tell Mark its over, he takes it surprisingly well, we talk over finances etc and realise it makes sense to live out the month or so left on our lease together but in separate rooms. I move into the spare room with my t.v. and Xbox. All is good. I'm slowly packing ready to leave, Mark is the perfect gentleman. Occasionally he'll watch some t.v. or play xbox in my room but is very respectful of my boundaries.

Mark goes out one morning and doesn't come home until 11pm, wakes me up and asks if he can watch a movie on the tv in my room. I tell him okay but he needs to sit on the lounge cause I'm sleeping. Morning comes and all seems fine.

I'm going out to grab some lunch and Mark asks to tag along, seems harmless. We grab some burgers and head to a park. During lunch I broached the topic of legally separating our finances. Mark doesn't like this. He gets angry. Then he gets quiet.
We get home and ge tells me how he spent the whole night watching me sleep, how peaceful it was. How he thought we were getting back together. I tell him I'm sorry he thought that but nothing has changed. And that's how the fight started. 

Hes lashing out verbally. Slinging abuse at me then lapsing into silence for hours at a time before starting up all over again.
At some point he just snapped. Comes barging into my room, picks up my packed boxes and hurling them at me while I cower in the corner screaming for someone to call the cops, someone to help me. Its 2am, the neighbours ignored this for hours.
Eventually he runs out of boxes to throw and walks out to the lounge room to grab a chair, I jump up and go to close the door, he realizes and comes sprinting back, gets his forearm thru the door as I slam it shut. Cue him going on about me breaking his arm etc. He seems to have calmed down tho, says ""just open the door enough for me to pull my arm out, I need to go to hospital"" I complie, he slams the door open, drags me out, throws me into the kitchen and starts laughing like a fucking maniac about how I've ""done it now"".

I grab a big ass chefs knife, put it on my wrist and tell him I'd cut myself, call the ambulance and get myself locked in a psych ward if it meant I'd be safe from him. I don't even know how he got the knife from me, but next thing its at my throat and he's yelling-

""You want to fucking kill yourself, I'll fucking kill you, I'll show you how its really done""

-Im bleeding where the knife is stabbing me and I was done, I've got the cops on the phone. I'm screaming my address down the phone, telling them he has a knife.

That must have done it. Suddenly the psychopath turns the knife on himself and hacks his fuckin arms to shreds. He collapses on the floor, bleeding out, rocking back and forth yelling ""you've done it now, look what you've done, you've killed me""

I said fuck it and locked myself in the bathroom till the cops and ambos rock up. He gets raced down to the ambo all while telling the cops I did this to him. The cops come up and question me, tell me I'm probably going to be arrested because  it's his word against mine.

The only thing that saved me from being arrested is that the paramedic knew me. He convinced the cops to look closer at the wounds because they looked self inflicted, this is when Mark finally tells them he did it and gets carted off to hospital. 

The cops kinda shrug and leave me to clean up the blood, suggesting I call a friend and move out in the morning. I clean up, lock myself in, text my sister and wait for 6am when I knew she'd wake up and call me. I moved out that day.

Find out a week later he was on Ice the night he ""watched me sleep"" and the ensuing violence was him 'coming down'. The best bit? Mark was the one who told me, thinking that I'd take him back because ""its not my fault, it was the drugs"" 

For the first time in a long time I actually laughed, told him to fuck himself and hung up. Turns out I really did have a solid hard limit, too bad I didn't have more back then.

I tried to follow up and have him charged but the cops ""couldn't find anything"" on the incident when I went into the station the next day. I was young and dumb and didn't pursue the issue.
