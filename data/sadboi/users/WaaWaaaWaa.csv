unpopularopinion,fox9xxg,t3_ga249i,1588137850.0,"I agree about the lying. Well. Half agree. But even if you cut for attention, big or small, you need help. Idc if you *barely* bleed or something, you should still get help. When I started to self harm, I did very superficial cuts, and I hated myself for it. Later, I got to fat. As you can see, telling someone this can be harmful. Even if it is for attention, it means you are hurting. And you have no other way to reach out, or you think you dont. Same thing with lying. I see what you mean tho, lying about it is wrong, but if it is an actual cry for help, then you should take it seriously. On the other hand, romanticizing it and saying I cut, is wrong however. Being like haha I cut myself is making fun of a serious mental health problem, and that person should be taught about why there wrong. Ok that's all"
