It's almost been a year. I was pretty much experiencing the worst psychotic episode (hallucinations, delusions) I had ever faced in my life thus far, which came with me screwing things up a lot and losing some people from my life. That broke me one night, which led me to sneak out of our house while it started raining. It's all a blur but I do remember lying down on the middle of the rain-drenched road, waiting (getting run over was something I never seriously considered before then, as I didn't want a driver to have to face a lawsuit courtesy of my family. My head was on overdrive that night lol). It was dark and the vehicles were driving fast, but by some miracle a guy riding a motorcycle stopped to bring my sobbing self to the gasoline station which was literally a few meters away. By this time a small crowd was gathered around us, and I was begging the guy to *please let me go.* He restrained me from breaking free with some sort of bear hug until I eventually calmed down and the authorities arrived to bring me to the municipal hall. The guy followed suit and brought along his wife, both of whom took the time to talk to me and comfort me until my parents arrived.

So much more happened after those few hours but I'll always be thankful for the kindness and concern the two of them had shown me. It was around midnight and I didn't understand--and I still don't--why two people traveling home from work would make the effort to look after a drenched, crying teenage girl (whom they found lying on the road!) without anything in return. My parents were offering them wads of cash as a thank you but they refused to accept it. I hope I see them around again bc I don't think I was able to really express my gratitude that night. I hope they're doing well."
TheMotte,foy7dxs,t3_ga66w8,1588166976.0,"Started out my time in university as a major in Political Science, as is quite common for undergraduates in my country planning to take up law afterwards. Parents raised me with the standards and disciplinary approach stereotypical of Asian tiger parenting, fully expecting me to eventually take over their law firm. While I've long adapted this into my mental model of my plans, I've recently caught myself more drawn towards a possible future in academia, public policy, international relations, economics, or anything in between. Been vaguely interested as well in data, productivity, and metacognition, but I've only come so far as to lurk silently and save links to content that might be of interest in the future. 

Would love some insight on these disciplines as fields of study and possible career paths, as well as some advice re: navigating through uncertainty in this situation. (Also pondering on migrating elsewhere years from now--for those staying in cities particularly known for an industry or field, I'd love to hear your thoughts about its likely future and how expats usually fare)"

If you do want to learn how to write the characters, make sure to follow the prescribed stroke order! There are a lot of free writing exercises you can download and print out for practicing your writing.

I recommend you to adopt Anki flashcards or any other spaced repetition system for learning your vocab. It's also important that you get the basics down on how the words are pronounced.

\- Tieba (贴吧­), which is pretty much a Chinese Reddit (it’s interest based as well and has a ton of subcommunities). It’s owned by Baidu which allows it to rank well in search results and rake up web traffic. In my opinion it's similar to Reddit as well in terms of the community (a lot of teenagers – young adults, some trolls, high quality niche communities)

\- Douban (豆瓣)--it's clustered around forums and their interests as well, but it’s more focused about media (reviewing and recommending books, music, films, etc) and lifestyle categories such as tech, events, etc. Really interesting discussions scattered across the platform.

\- Tianya (天涯): has a lot of topics as well, has separate categories for discussions about politics, international relations, law, etc. Demographic seems to be more mature with university and workplace-centric threads. I've noticed that its users can be really patriotic at times.

Going through the top posts and comments in Weibo hot/trending topics can give quick insight on the general, sentiments and first impression of users on the news, though of course it’s usually not as nuanced as in forums.

In terms of the NYT/WSJ Chinese equivalent, I'd recommend independent media companies like Caijing (财经), Caixin (财新传媒) ((their core staff are mostly former employees of Caijing)), Sanlian Life Week (三联生活周刊), and China Newsweek. They publish a lot of analysis and in-depth content about politics, finance, public affairs, business, etc, and have all reported about the situation in Wuhan (here’s Caijing’s [exposé](https://xw.qq.com/cmsid/20200225A09LQ100?clicktime=1582726736&enterid=1582726736&from=timeline&isappinstalled=0) on local officials in Wuhan, and there have also been [claims](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/07/20/the-forbidden-zone) that its readership includes influential officials in academia, finance, and the government)

Hope all this helps! Lol apologies for another wall of text, it's just exciting for me to encounter discussions such as this around here"

TheMotte,fmkjc43,t3_fvpnk6,1586156923.0,"Based on my observations as an intermittent lurker on Zhihu, it does seem to me that the users of the site generally hold similar sentiments to the writers of the posts you've translated.

One of the most upvoted responses to the top [question](https://www.zhihu.com/question/382792598) (""*How do you view the recent suspension of entry for foreigners \[holding Chinese visas and residence permits\]? What impact will this policy have?*"") from last week was by a Chinese doctor who [wrote](https://www.zhihu.com/question/382792598/answer/1107306290) (almost 17k upvotes) that he won't need to continue wearing protective gear anymore. He said that even if the frontline medical personnel in Wuhan are now recuperating, many other healthcare workers are still fighting the virus. With the outbreak of the virus abroad, more people entering China could bring more infections. Another [post](https://www.zhihu.com/question/382792598/answer/1107302494) (5k upvotes) stated that with no new cases being reported recently, it can be said that China is possibly one of the safest countries to be in at the moment. Foreigners who may be infected being allowed entry at this point will mean that all the sacrifices and efforts made to achieve this peace will be in vain. A comment under a [top response](https://www.zhihu.com/question/384520686/answer/1124474957) about Americans' disbelief of Chinese-reported COVID-19 numbers for another recent top [question](https://www.zhihu.com/question/384520686) (""*What do you think about the worldwide number of coronavirus cases exceeding 1 million on April 3? How long will it take to control the pandemic?*"") did an impersonation of the American mindset in response to the virus, ""*You can't do better than me because I'm the best in the world. If you're doing better than me, it's only because you're cheating. If there's a pandemic, you're withholding information. If it's about sports, you're doping/using performance-enhancement drugs. If it's about technology, you're plagiarizing us.*"" (7k upvotes)

**One thing which sets Zhihu apart from other sites** is its ""salt value"" point system, with which users can build their influence and prove their credibility by being rated under different categories through applying algorithms to user data. These include the ""basic credit"" (基础信用), referring to their profile which includes qualifications such as educational and work background, along with certification; this functions to establish credibility to a user by indicating the areas they may be highly knowledgeable of. There are also the content creation  (内容创作) and community-building (社区建设) dimensions which evaluate the quality of a user's content and how often they post, and their participation in the community by actively providing feedback, editing posts, upvoting and downvoting, etc. Lastly are the friendliness (友善互动)  and community behavior (遵守公约) categories, which are respectively rated based on whether a user engages respectfully in discourse and their adherence to the site's terms of service. It seems to be a part of the ""credit craze"" in China among tech companies with the institutionalization of a nationwide social credit system. There are users who find this to be a welcome feature which upholds the quality of the discussions on the site by disallowing abusive behavior and limiting the proliferation of disinformation, while there is another opinion that this policy allows for more censorship. 2 years ago, the Beijing Cyberspace Administration [ordered](https://www.sohu.com/a/224728829_100106801) that all app stores take down the Zhihu application for a week due to ""poor supervision and the spread of illegal information,"" following the [proposal](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1090562.shtml) of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee to scrap the two-term limit for the president which resulted in intense censorship across different social networking sites. Terms such as ""Winnie the Pooh"" (a character commonly used to mock Xi Jinping), ""Animal Farm,"" and ""personality cult"" were blocked from being posted on social networking site Weibo along with many [others](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/02/sensitive-words-emperor-xi-jinping-ascend-throne/). Zhihu [stated](https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/2018/03/%E7%9F%A5%E4%B9%8E%EF%BC%9A%E5%A6%82%E6%9E%9C%E5%8F%B8%E6%9C%BA%E7%96%B2%E5%8A%B3%E9%A9%BE%E9%A9%B6%E4%B8%8D%E6%8D%A2%E7%8F%AD%EF%BC%8C%E4%B9%98%E5%AE%A2%E6%80%8E%E4%B9%88%E5%81%9A%EF%BC%9F/) that it would adjust accordingly in light of their failure to moderate the existence of such “unlawful information” on their platform. 

Personally, Zhihu has been really useful to me for learning about the different lives, trends, and the culture in PRC. I've read about top posts with thousands of upvotes being “made-up stories” posted by “fake” accounts for the purpose of propaganda, though I can’t really verify this claim. A few weeks ago, I read about a hateful anti-American post receiving tons of upvotes and agreement but I can’t seem to find it in the alleged OP’s [account](https://www.zhihu.com/people/tk-wild/answers). Please take these with a grain of salt.

Thanks for reading my thoughtdump, and please do inform me for corrections and if I missed anything. I hope this was able to provide some insight and context on how the site works.

To OP, thank you for taking the time and effort to create this thread!"

AskWomen,f11kud1,t3_c7w822,1569126953.0,"Was the least attractive in my friend group. Big F. My friends would always receive gifts and surprises from random admirers and I never did, not even once lol! I would be lying if I said I didn't really mind. Life was really shitty back then I would've appreciated some gifts and validation here and there but oh well.

First year of college and I look the same. It's depressing. Been getting compliments but I'm pretty sure these people just want something from me lmfao!! Am determined to lose as much weight as possible before this semester ends. Wish me luck."
