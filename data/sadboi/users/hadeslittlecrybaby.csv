BPD,faa994f,t3_e8b1xj,1575905374.0,yesss i am a woc with bpd
BPD,f7ovt46,t3_dx91nl,1573935583.0,"i failed college as well. same position and my toxic ex FP abandoned me so i thought it was the end. anyways i was able to take a year off. having a support system to be able to tell this to would be great. 

i know you may not be in a place to take a break from school but if you are i really recommended it."
BPD,f7ova04,t3_dxbjus,1573935193.0,im sorry he called you f*cked up and just kinda left it at that. when he’s ready you should definitely try and talk to him about that :(
BPD,ewjer5l,t3_cokxa8,1565465551.0,i swear i needed to see this
BPD,ew4c1z4,t3_cms89n,1565107417.0,"definitely picking up a new hobby. making sure your inner circle of friends/family/support system know not to bring them up (out of sight out of mind) type thing. staying off social media for a while helps or limiting it. 

writing personally helps me. every time i thought about them or wanting to contact them i would write to or about them but never gave it to them. 

i now no longer think about this person and we practically lived together. i had to see them at work for about four months after i told them i wanted nothing to do with them. they had bpd as well so it was definitely hard for both of us. 

i’m here if you ever want to vent or share stories! i know you can do it, persistence is key and telling yourself to keep them blocked is what its going to take :)"
