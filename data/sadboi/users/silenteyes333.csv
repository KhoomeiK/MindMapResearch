EmotionalAbuseSupport,eud85by,t3_cfw415,1563706749.0,"I'm sorry to hear how this turned out. I went through something similar with my mom. I kept a diary with a key. She found both one day. I looked for it after i came home from school and it was gone. I asked her where it was and she told me i shouldn't have been writing things like that. I would vent a lot and also used curse words because i had so much anger by the age of 10 already.

 She never once apologized or asked why i was angry. I wrote about my depression and missing my dad. Nothing from her. It totally changed our relationship. Even now I keep our conversations short and to the surface because i dont tust her....or anyone else for that matter.

My way of trying to deal with it now is to feel out a person before revealing information. With my mother I tell her what she needs to know and that's it. I have mourned the relationship i wish we had. We are civil and that's better than fighting. With other people I let them talk more than me so i can kinda figure them out first. 

Sometimes mistakes are made and the wrong person knows. That is something that will need to be accepted. You can only control your reactions of course. I would say the best advice is to get to know the person and be patient with yourself. If the other person is not patient with you, is tude, etc... then you have your answer. Just take your time... it's not easy trying to heal from the past."

Hello there, I've been away from reddit a bit but just received this message in reference to pen pals. Thank you for replying. Those topics you mentioned are also interesting to me. What type of spiritual stuff do you mean exactly though. Just wondering if it's to a certain aspect or just everything basically. Reason being, I am agnostic but spiritual.
