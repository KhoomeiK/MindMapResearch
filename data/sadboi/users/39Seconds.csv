the idea of the grey birds sinking their “claws” into my power lines. A metaphor for my willpower. And strength being torn from me 
and i remember a strange vision i had of an old lady who felt unworldly, speaking to me almost sympathetic like i was a 5 year old messing up, saying “Oh young achiever life has no prize” like my chase for all this possession and love constructed by others, who have no clue what life is really about either, like i was following my peer thinking it was my teacher. 

I don’t know why i responded with this but typing it out makes me feel like i understand myself better ahhaa well at least my thought process."

Back when my mom was around, don’t kid you wrong my mom was a very normal person, she had heaps of friends and a good job and loved art, but every so often she would tell me , basically rephrased for me as a child that she was going to die soon. “if mommy goes will you take care of your little brother” etc, and I only realised it when i grew up, a few years after she passed, and it was very weird as she was a healthy person, early 40’s at the time, and no medical conditions of any sort. and from my memory my dad had no idea that my mom was dying because he was looking at houses for us at the time, and never gave off a vibe, that he and my mom were hiding anything from me and my siblings, 

but the day my mom died,  It was the middle of the day and i was on the trampoline with my younger brother in the backyard (note this backyard was relatively big and had a large slope with flat section  at the bottom where the trampoline was), i was bouncing and all of the sudden the trampoline stopped being elastic and stopped bouncing for me, pretty much concrete, but not for my brother, it wasn’t like a bad double bounce or anything along those terms, i landed,  slamming and then falling on my back, All i could describe was a feeling as if you get up to quickly and you feel extremely lightheaded and tingly, except it was all over my body, i lay there for a few seconds while my brother keeps bouncing pretty much unaware that i was lying down, I lift my head up slightly and my eyes catch something, through the netting of the trampoline.  On top of the slope was this Woman dressed in a badge whitish outfit, staring down at me, at first i thought it was one of my moms friends and i was going to say hi, but I didn’t . She had black hair and she looked really tall, but I couldn’t assume cause it was a deceptive angle i was looking from, i didn’t know what i was doing we made eye contact for a few seconds and then my brother, says these words i’ll remember for the rest of my life, while still bouncing slightly, “Your pig mother is over” my brother was 6, the woman stepped back from the top of the slope, My mom died in bed that day, I’m now 17 and i still go to Counselling twice a week.

Edit : My brother has no recollection of saying that btw"
