I have a lot of mental issues as well, including some that you describe. It takes a special personality to mesh with mine, which is why it took so long for me to find my perfect match.

The first thing is she has to be willing to improve herself because it is not fair to you if she makes no effort and just expects you to accept it.

I understand there are some things about her that cannot be cured or helped, but some probably could be.

I don't really have any advice because I don't know how I would handle that. But I know one thing, you're not responsible for her. But also if this is your first relationship you don't have to keep yourself tied down to a person you can't see a future with.

Good luck"
