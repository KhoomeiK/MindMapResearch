There was an activity we did where we just sat together quietly in a room and wrote whatever we wanted on paper. I guess it was supposed to be cathartic or something. Anyway, I wrote about being gay and none of my friends knowing and thinking they wouldn’t like it cause religion, yknow. I went home a week later and took that paper with me. I’m a pretty disorganized person and when I’m at home I don’t have like a chair or desk or anything if I’m sitting down I’m always on my bed. So even now I still like keep items on my bed like my controller, glasses, headphones, etc. and back then I just put the paper on my bed. It fell off between the head and the wall. My dad eventually picked it up and opened it and read it. We were in the car I don’t remember where we were going but I remember the freeway and exactly where on that freeway he brought it up and told me he loved me and fully accepted me as I am. Great response I guess. But as someone with an anxiety disorder, a bad relationship with him my whole life, and the fact that he invaded my privacy I fucking HATED it. And to this day I feel horrible that he ever read that. He’s not someone I’m close with and not someone I would ever choose to share my sexuality with. And as for my all the friends I’ve had over the years, I’ve never really had to come out I’ve just made comments like “oh he’s cute” or said I agreed when a girl said a guy was attractive or something like that. The only people I can think of who don’t know would be my current coworkers. I’ve always had a hard time being platonically close with guys and opening up to them so I figure if they find out that’s fine but I don’t really need to tell them."

If I didn’t have a significant other to worry about when my dad gave me the option of this specific treatment or leaving the house I honestly would’ve just left and kept drinking and using. I understand addiction is hard to watch but I’ve never been belligerent, violent, or stolen from my family or anything like that. It feels bad that he was willing to risk that outcome. It feels like it was more about “This is my house and we don’t want drugs in this house.” Then again I don’t pay rent so who am I to say anything about anything.

Also just being in a 12-step based IOP right now I’ve been vaguely aware of alternatives to AA but I haven’t done my own research and everyone in AA acts like it’s the only solution. Thank you for giving me a place to start. I don’t want to feel powerless my whole life and rely on calling other guys every day to keep me from relapsing or to quell my suicidal urges. When my anxiety gets the best of me I’m just alone and can’t call anyone because I’m too anxious. I want my own power and tools to recover. I hadn’t even really given much thought to alternatives because people keep telling me a spiritual solution is the only way. The only part about it I enjoy is meditation but I can’t force other beliefs on myself. Fuck, thank you. Side note that last one about controlling drinking is just funny to me cause I know some people can get to that point but personally I just don’t believe I can I just need to abstain lol"
atheism,fqdtvdi,t1_fqdtij1,1589296507.0,No no you’re all good. This conversation wouldn’t just ignite feelings I haven’t already been having. I’ve never really liked AA as much as everyone in AA seems to like it and I’m still trying to figure out if that’s my brain trying to get me to do something that will lead to a relapse or if it’s just social anxiety or if I actually don’t like it. But I can say for sure I don’t like or fully understand the subscription to a higher power. The person I originally replied to provided some links with information on alternatives too which is nice.
atheism,fqdrlk8,t1_fqdqq2l,1589295369.0,"Like I said it could be like a door knob. It’s just something that gives the alcoholic/addict something outside of themselves to ask for strength to recover and whatnot. The idea is that when an alcoholic/addict follows their own will they usually end up drinking/using. You make a really good point though I imagine they would think it’s weird if I said Allah or Krishna or whatever else. But if I personally chose to use Allah as my higher power no one would care. I don’t like writing about this anymore the more I think about it the more I don’t want to do AA lol. I guess my point is no one has forced anything on me, religious things or otherwise"
atheism,fqdpvk9,t1_fqdp4sl,1589294493.0,"Not everyone calls it God. I guess I shouldn’t say *strictly* non-religious because as I said there’s people who are religious. I meant that any religious aspect an individual in the program subscribed to is never forced upon anyone else in my experience. But I know lots of people in AA who are actually anti-religion. Like they fucking hate it. I should have said the book uses the word God. And the group as a whole uses the word God because that’s what the book says and part of each meeting is reading directly from the book. But what the book says is “God, *as we understand Him*” with a huge emphasis on the second part. Someone’s higher power could literally be a doorknob if they choose that. When I thought I would try it out I just chose the universe as my higher power but still had a hard time with it. I felt silly trying to pray to the stars, or anything for that matter."

atheism,fqdl8u6,t1_fqdhjjj,1589291996.0,"Hi I’m in a 12-step recovery program right now. Now, I’m definitely NOT religious but I’m young and living with my parents and it was this or getting kicked out. I imagine AA is as you describe in some more religious areas of the US, but where I’m from it’s not very religious at all. The book was written in the 1930s so you can imagine why the cofounder used the word God. But all the experience I have with AA has been strictly non-religious. We use the word God as a simple and familiar way to describe a higher power. And that higher power is merely a spiritual thing. It could literally be your dog, nature, the universe, or actually God if you’re into that. I guess it’s kind of like a made up “god” not for worshipping but to give people something to to hand their lives over to so they can recover. For me personally I gave my entire life over to drugs and alcohol and worshipped the shit out of them. I really have no power or control over them. So maybe I need to give my life over to a higher power. That’s the idea behind allowing a higher power to have power over you, because personally I allowed drugs and alcohol to have complete power over me for a long while. There’s definitely religious people in AA who use the Christian God as their higher power. I respect that but for myself I say fuck that. There’s also plenty of people who are atheists, agnostics, and just vehemently anti-religion. And honestly those who do identify as Christian or Catholic or whatever other similar sect are the most in line with those ideologies I’ve ever seen in my life. So much more so than all those holier than thou motherfuckers. In my experience these are actual respectable and compassionate people.

All of that being said, I still don’t like it. I have a lot of respect for the program and I’ve seen people who have completely turned their lives around who I’m not sure could do it any other way. The only people I’ve seen relapse are the ones who haven’t followed the program to a T. And I’m one of them, but I just don’t think it’s for me and honestly don’t want much else to do with it when I’m done with this outpatient program and whatever amount of AA meetings the court sentences me to. So please don’t think I’m some AA spokesperson or anything. I’m not trying to talk it up, just sharing my experience with it.

Edit: I just wanna add one of the problems I have with it is I have a really hard time truly believing in some sort of higher power. My parents were never religious nuts but I was forced to go to church at times as a kid and that really turned me off completely to the idea of ANY sort of weird power over me or outside of myself. I did a total flip and became an atheist and huge lover of science and I can’t seem to shake the fact that I think some unknown and inexplicable power or being is out there somewhere is silly as fuck."

This helped me establish a much more frequent routine in attending them. Basically everything being virtual now has helped too. I was able to see a psychiatrist and get on proper meds for my anxiety. The only negative impact is the isolation, but the positive stuff seems to outweigh that.
