raisedbynarcissists,fgud97m,t3_f0c2m6,1581117991.0,"Yep, my mom says that if I move out she won’t know what to do with herself or my siblings. I’m 21f, pretty much being a parent since I was 8. My siblings are 20f and 18m, yet they are children and aren’t capable of working yet. We are super poor yet my mom acts and spends like we’re middle class, hence my money goes down the drain when she’s constantly short after I pay rent, yet its always my fault that I don’t have money even though all I do is work and never spend anything,(trying to save up but not working bc all they do is steal my money then get pissed and gaslight me when I try to hide my stuff and then make me feel insane) it’s a fun time."

I just need to let my mind go blank to calm me down. Like what you said about breathing, that reeeeaaallly helped me. I just sat on the floor and was rubbing my carpet to feel the scratchiness and like, idk it helped me feel stable. Honestly going to just screenshot this for next time I get like this. I forget how much doing simple things like that reaaaallly help. Sucks when your in that state of mind bc you forget how little things can make a huuuuge difference. I went from almost full blown feeling like I’m going to explode to kind of shakiness so I’ll take it, thank you so much again"

I’m on the lowest dose and I’ve been too scared to get on a higher one, even though I probably should, and I’m also a super creative artistic person. I love putting my emotions in my art and I’m also scared that I’ll go numb. Just wanted to let you know your not alone or the only one. Wish I could help"
insaneparents,f8zrlgy,t1_f8zr3nb,1574964099.0,"It doesn’t matter, if she wants to pick up her life she can do it by putting her pride down and actually working jobs she “doesn’t feel like working bc she wants her weekends” or “but if my old high school friends see I’ll feel like a loser” like she needs to put down that shit and get to work if she wants to put food down on the table and buy a house instead of renting."

I’ve been helping them for years, they are all grown ass adults, if my siblings need help I will help them, but I’m done helping my mom, she makes the same mistakes constantly, she’s a huge narcissist, it’s not my responsibility to help out the family. I just realized that not too long ago. I need to start my life and pursue the things I need to do, not be the parent and spouse to my mother and my two siblings."
insaneparents,f8zpucl,t1_f8zpcg6,1574963563.0,Oh no my mom is extremely abusive emotionally and mentally so I want to leave ASAP bc I’m tired of being drained by her unresponsible bullshit and blaming me for all of her problems

I’m glad I have younger siblings bc I feel like that helped her accept it more but yeah, all of those were the best.  I feel like the shows raised me more than my mom ever did lmao"
Anxiety,f8exj3k,t3_e0fhsz,1574535238.0,"Congrats on making the post!! I use to be in the same boat you were in. I think it really helps when you join a community and have small discussions. But pat yourself on the back for doing this! If you get extremely anxious about making another one, try the comments out first and just put little things here and there, it will really help and make a difference, even if it’s a small “that’s cool” or whatever you were reading. That’s what reeeaally helped me get out of my comfort zone and be able to join in discussions and create my own posts on here or any other social media"
raisedbynarcissists,f8esvhg,t3_e0ii6y,1574533186.0,"I totally feel the same with this. I’m 21F and I got Disney+ too. I literally did the same thing when I was little, when my mom would scream and like break me apart or if she was nonexistent I’d always watch Disney or nick or Cartoon Network to escape. Those shows and movies were my go-to and I still like to watch them bc it just makes me feel safe and that I can have a normal life and everything’s going to be ok, as childish as that sounds lol it helped then and it still helps now"
BorderlinePDisorder,f7g73jc,t3_dw2a1f,1573696244.0,And like after all this shit is done I’ll be like wtf why would I ever think those things everything Is totally fine and then I’ll forget this panic or whatever the hell it is ever happened and the process repeats over and over and over again except it’s been getting worse over the years and more intense or at least I think but I can’t remember BC I dissociate and forget everything and think life is so dandy butterflies until I feel like I’m going to die again liek wtffffff
BorderlinePDisorder,f7akjhp,t3_dv4hna,1573531651.0,"I honestly feel. I ruin new relationships all the time. I usually stay away from guys or eventually make them hate me so I can push them away and say “see, they eventually would hate me and they hate me for this reason because of this” or wait for them to fuck up and be like “see this guy is a terrible person I have to get away” instead of taking a risk and seeing where things go. It really fricken sucks and it really really sucks when you fall for someone and then they just don’t like you back. Honestly my worst fear is what just happened to you, someone saying they love you and then go “oh wait I guess I don’t” like I don’t want to just fall for someone who is going to take it back. It’s terrifying and I’m really sorry you have to go through this, hoping for the best outcome for you, try not to think too deep about this and get sucked in the dark. You deserve someone who will understand what your going through fully, and is patient and actually truly loves you and means it"
