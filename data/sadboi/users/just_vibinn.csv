And even now, it's still hard to think of my parents as abuser and not people who express love in different way (this is not love). It's gonna be a long process to rethink this, but I will be doing PHP soon so hopefully that will help."
emotionalabuse,fadflo8,t3_e7okxn,1575968908.0,"Absolutely. Even though I recognized that my parents will never love me the way I want them to, the sting is still there. All I ever wanted was them to affirm me. Tried to be the best and perfect in everything so they wouldn’t be able to shit on me, and finally give me some praise. Even though I know that this toxic perfectionism is hurting me and making things worse, I still want to keeping doing it so they would love me. But I’ve achieved so much at this point in my life, if they won’t love me now they never will."

My dad threw away my 8th grade history notebook (which had notes and was graded) and then blamed me for leaving it on the kitchen table. He’s also thrown away my birth certificate, so I that says a lot about how he feels."

EatingDisorders,faapr32,t3_e89y2v,1575911947.0,"Yes, I really needed to hear this. I've struggled a lot with accepting my ED. Since I felt like I wasn't extremely thin or purging everyday, it felt like I was okay. And eventually I saw results so I've been persuaded to keep this mentality to ""look even better."" Didn't also help that I was fat shamed from my parents from a very young age (and I was not even overweight). To this day, I still feel my parents would only love me if I was severely underweight. But I am seeking real help for it now, so hopefully my relationship with food and my body will improve drastically!"

Also think the surf photo is fucking hilarious, so it should second or third. I think replace the group photo with the one with parents. I also think 5/6 is enough. Sorry if this is more advice than you asked for, but I feel the pictures should be: 

1. Cat
2. Dumbells
3. Surfing
4. Parents
5. Military or baseball 
6. group wedding

Good luck! Maybe I'll see you on there since I'm in the area hahah"
sex,f9qtpt1,t3_e6ie7b,1575566786.0,"I had some questions about this myself recently. This is the kind of sex I like to have, but a part of me now thinks it’s byproduct of how I was raised (conservative Christian, only sex-ed was porn). When I first starting having sex, I based everything I did off porn even though I knew that it wasn’t indicative of what “regular sex” was like. But of course I didn’t know what that regular sex even entailed so I stuck with the aggressive porn.

Another layer is that it makes me look hot to my partners. Obviously I don’t want to be seen solely as a sexual object or treated with disrespect, but it is nice when partners tell me I’m hot because I like it rough. Serves as an ego boost for me too (while I do have self-esteem issues, I do recognize this is the hottest and most attractive that I’ve even been). 

One more layer is that I’m very extroverted with a loud, fun personality and am confident/aggressive (in a good way).  This has made me come off as “bigger” to most (i.e. people are shocked well I tell them I’m 5’4 even after knowing them for a while since they thought I was somehow much taller; after they usually say “I didn’t realize how small you are until know”). That and the a fact that I’m athletic, can lift very heavy, and generally do not act feminine aside from the way I dress makes me feel “masculine.” So there’s an aspect of rough sex that makes me feel small and “feminine” by virtue of being dominated by a (typically much larger) male partner. Didn’t realize until after typing this last path that it reflects some problematic gender roles though lol"

depression_help,f7n28ak,t3_dwjxhm,1573881481.0,"How long have you been on the mirtazapine? I've been on it before and sometimes that's just what happens when your body is adjusting. Usually that adjustment period if longer than a week, and can extend into 8 weeks. Another factor is the dosing. I noticed for the sertraline your doctor gave you a very high dose for an initial treatment. When I started sertraline, I took 12.5mg for a week, then increased slowly from there for a couple of weeks before I hit 50mg. And while I had symptoms, it was not nearly as bad as what your were describing. Of course, everyone is different and I'm not a medical professional, but talk to your doctor about adjusting the dose. Maybe you need to start small with the mertazapine and then work your way up to the full dose. Hope this helps."
depression_help,f7n1rge,t3_dwsr4i,1573880974.0,"I think just being there for her is enough. Reaching out and showing that you care does wonders for a person. I'm not sure she's looking for a someone to relate to her or 'fix' her, but rather someone to listen and to actively supporting (which I think you're doing a great job at). I'm going through the a similar thing with my friends, except with them they kind of just ignore my mental health struggles because they don't know how to talk about it. But in reality I don't want them to unpack every trauma or come up with solutions; I have a therapist and a psychiatrist for that. I just want them to listen and be there for me, and to recognize that my struggles are valid instead of pretending they don't exist since they don't understand it. If anything, maybe suggest she see if her insurance will cover a trip to a mental health specialist. Talking to a professional is super helpful. Keep supporting her like you are."
