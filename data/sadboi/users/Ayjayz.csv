Path of Exile became popular precisely because it *didn't* go the mainstream route of dumbing everything down, and it turns out there's a sizeable niche of people who like a deep and complex game.

>  I shouldn't have to consult an online guide 

You don't have to do anything in PoE. There are no goals besides what you set yourself. If you're going for a challenging goal then of course reading a guide will help. Reading a guide will help you become better at *any* game, not just PoE.

If you're saying you should be able to see all the content in Path of Exile without getting good, well, you just fundamentally don't understand what Path of Exile is all about.

I don't think the game is perfect. Performance is an obvious issue. I don't love how support skills have all become a ~30% more damage multiplier- I would like all supports to become utility only, with only very situational damage benefits. I don't like the new endgame system half as much as the old one. I think melee and summoning both need a rethinking from the ground up. I would like if skills interacted with each other more - a few generator + spender combinations like they have in D3 would be a great addition. I don't love unique items in general and sometimes wonder if they're truly necessary. Maybe they're in a fine spot, but I certainly wouldn't be opposed to trialling removing them entirely and adding their effects to rare items in some other fashion.

Plus other things. I don't think the game is perfect. I think the UI and trading systems are in a pretty fantastic spot, though, and strike a great balance between ease of use and also rewarding mastery of many diverse systems.

> you're the crowd that will keep this game from ever having any actual mainstream popularity

Good. I hope it never does. The mainstream only likes dumb games and there are precious few games left that reward careful thought and deep understanding and mastery. The mainstream has almost every other game they can play, I hope PoE is left for people like me."

It's not a shit answer. It's literally demonstrating that there are ways to solve the problem. If you haven't found a way, it's not because no way exists - it's because you haven't found it yet.

> also, you’re missing the point. if only there was a system developed where items listed are actually sold instantly once you decide to buy it without having the player needing to respond and trade manually in person. you know, a system where you can actually sell stuff while offline or busy in game, and don’t actually have to deal with price fixers.

If that system existed then there would be zero point to playing the game and everything would lose all meaning. You wouldn't even look at anything you picked up, it would all be ctrl-clicked straight into a stash tab from which you would receive regular doses of currency. The illusion around the Skinner box would be shattered and you would stop playing since your brain would trivially see through to the reality that you're just clicking a button for hours on end.

In short, it would destroy Path of Exile if that system was implemented. If you can't see that then thank god you're not in charge of making decisions."

Games,fql63zm,t1_fqkyqvr,1589447567.0,"When you look at the overall cost to produce a game, I don't think 30% of that cost is needed to simply host the game and accept credit card payments.

Steam would probably make a profit on a 2% charge, or just a flat amount per unit sold. 30% is absurd. They diverted nearly a *third* of all revenue generated by the PC gaming platform to themselves. That's insane. That's *so much*. 30% taken by the market and 70% is left for literally everything else that goes into producing the game itself."

""Your father was murdered by Vader"" ""... ohhh wait I meant *metaphorically* murdered, yea totally not trying to retcon anything"". Not to mention Luke kissing Leia only for them to turn out to be siblings.

The difference is that stuff doesn't really matter because the movies themselves were good. You don't need planning if you just make good movies."

None of them have pixel art, and really the only popular recent 2d sidescrollers were Hollow Knight and Celeste. I guess there was like Shovel Knight from 2014? Are people still playing that?

Meanwhile, you want to list all the popular 3rd person action/adventure games from AAA studios? You already listed a couple. Really, anything except Doom Eternal in the last few years. Maybe some Nintendo stuff as well."
