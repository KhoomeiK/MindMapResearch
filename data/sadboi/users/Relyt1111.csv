My daughter had met with friends at the waterfront nearby last sat/sun night and i asked her if she saw it as she would have had an awesome view of it over the ocean. She said they looked but couldn't see it.

I checked for myself in the cloudless sky littered with stars but it did not appear. I must have looked for it at least 5 times at 1 hour intervals.

This puzzled me immensely.

I finally located the moon in the daytime sky, still over 90% full as i was leaving for work 2 days later and it was slightly more in the northern sky.

This bothered me as it was not a logical change.

Fast forward another 2 days and the moon is back in the original eastern night sky position where it should have been."
