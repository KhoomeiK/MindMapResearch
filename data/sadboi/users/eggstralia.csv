Sounds almost cruel though, when thrown at someone struggling/given up on trying to make meaningful social/romantic relationships. 

""Oh for most your life you've felt socially alienated, unwelcomed and devalued? duuude easy fix, just don't be those things. People love it when your not those things, trust me.""

Now I don't really know your life but I know mine¬† I lost my parents in my early twenties, both to cancer, I saw my mother cry a lot near the end, I was happy in a way, when she cried it meant that I had stopped crying around her so she could stop feeling obligated to maintain her composure, I saw her fragility, her fear, her regret. But I knew she was strong, she raised two boys alone, no family, no husband.

But I never appreciated just how strong she was until now, after seeing how you've reacted, how self-centred, childish, careless and vindictive your response to death has been, you've given me a deeper respect for people who have suffered whilst still giving love, what quite dignity, what bold selflessness.

(It does come across that you only care about those kids as immediate gratification tools for your ego and not as people. Maybe mull over why you appear that way to a stranger, if a stranger gets that feeling, are your kids capable of feeling like that?)

Live In a way so your children can succeed if they honor your memory.

It's really in the eye of the beholder, your eye seems disenchanted. 
Can you not find beaty in your immediate world, is your mortality truely so ugly, do you find nothing but pointless suffering when you examine a flower, so fleeting, so temporary, so forget-me-not. 

Now I know it's harsh and I know it's hard.
