SuicideWatch,fofati0,t1_foerhus,1587731428.0,"Ok, so it‚Äôs clear from your story that you are afraid of being a child molester. Other than the constant images of CP, and the persistent distress you‚Äôre experiencing as a result, you previously never thought about children in that way and you don‚Äôt have any natural desire to sexually attack these children. You have anxiety. That‚Äôs what is fueling these images. Child molesters are attracted to children; you are afraid of being attracted to children, but you‚Äôve never had any desire to molest them. That‚Äôs when you know you‚Äôre just OCD, not a child molester.

Try this: think of molesting children. Let those horrible images fill your brain. They will taunt you, just let them sit in your brain and don‚Äôt freak out. Then, just let the thought try everything it can to unsettle you. Do not react to the thought - just examine. The thoughts will go away if you are strong enough not to react. You have to realize that it‚Äôs just your brain taking your greatest fear and projecting it into your conscious until you go crazy basically.

For instance, there are people who are afraid of being murderers. There‚Äôs this one therapist who will meet with these clients and ask them to put a knife to his neck and gives them permission to kill him‚Äî the client can‚Äôt even lift the knife and starts bawling. It‚Äôs become clear then that it‚Äôs just a fear. There‚Äôs a podcast called Invisibilia which has an episode that delves into this example on a deeper level than I am, providing much more information about those who suffer from intrusive thoughts.

Also, pedophiles are human and probably watch the same TV shows as the rest of us. That doesn‚Äôt make us all pedophiles. However, I would not try to analyze whether you are pedophilic or not based on these logical responses I‚Äôm proposing to your situation because then you‚Äôll just come up when new arguments that try to convince you that you are a pedophile. Just let the thought show itself to you. Think ‚ÄúI am like my friend who was caught with CP.‚Äù And then don‚Äôt react. Don‚Äôt try to avoid the thought or argue with it. Do not argue with it whatsoever cause, again, there will always be a ‚Äúbut what if...‚Äù and you‚Äôll be at the drawing board again, trying to avoid the idea of being a predator. Your thoughts will fade when you do this one day. To quote Dumbledore from Harry Potter ‚ÄúFear of a name itself only increases fear.‚Äù Your avoidance of these thoughts is the problem ‚Äî they‚Äôre taunting you. Don‚Äôt let them get to you.

Also, there are a lot of conditions to obtaining consistent funding. Oh, and it can cost millions to provide lifelong care to a disabled child.

I also suffer from ‚Äúreal event"" OCD where I obsess about past social situations over and over again, playing them in my head while I imagine what people were thinking.

Those are intrusive thoughts, which is a form of OCD I used to suffer from before I figured out coping mechanisms, and you might be traumatized after seeing such horrific shit. I suggest going to a therapist. 

Although I‚Äôve never encountered what you have, just seeing news stories about people who committed gross crimes really freaked me out and invited a panic in me; questions arose like, ‚ÄúWhat if I might be like them?‚Äù These questions lasted for years, and I seriously wanted to kill myself and avoid anyone I loved because I hated myself so much. Eventually, I found help and and I learned how to fight back (without fighting back actually, which you‚Äôll see below).

Because of your repulsion, which is obviously justified, OCD latches on to your fears and it tortures you into insanity until you can‚Äôt even tell who you are anymore. If you have no desire to watch CP, you are not a pedophile. That‚Äôs the difference ‚Äî your disgust towards these mental images actually only strengthens them even more. If you don‚Äôt react, and you just let the thought stare back at you, they will fade. Your worries about being a bad person won‚Äôt go away, they may crop up in other ways, but these coping skills will help you to defeat them one by one and build your self-confidence.

As for the larger web of my intrusive thoughts, I constantly fear that I‚Äôm a bad person. Even listening to true crime podcasts plants these seeds of doubt, and I know I‚Äôm just sensitive, but I get so scared I just want to kill myself and not even consider the possibility.

I‚Äôm sorry for the long-winded response; I fear myself, especially when I‚Äôm being reckless, and what people are thinking.

Every name, and every child, has bullying potential. In this case, I think you‚Äôve done everything you can to avoid a name that‚Äôs worthy of bullying, so don‚Äôt stress. Although your sister is probably trying to help, I can see why it plants seeds of doubt in you regardless. I‚Äôm sorry your favorite name was tainted with that imagery."

Boys - Jasper, Rowan, Fletcher (Fletch first short), and an honor name that I also adore is Blake.

I also quite like the name Wren for a girl, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be using it :) annnnd I have enjoyed the name Kellan for a boy before, but it doesn‚Äôt make my top list."

SuicideWatch,fng2t3f,t3_g1afy7,1586920989.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry for the extraordinary pain you endured OP. Your family was wrong to abuse you, to hurt you like they did. The same goes for your SA perpetrator. This person did the unconscionable to you and you deserve better.

There‚Äôs no guarantees right now, but if venturing off to Korea and just letting life figure itself out isn‚Äôt a tempting option, then just see what each day has to bring and how you can incorporate your dreams into your everyday life. I feel like you can make music and record on YouTube if you just go for it and free yourself of the doubts your trauma has created inside of you.

I hope this helps. From one internet stranger to another, please know that I care about you. And please don‚Äôt kill yourself."

How about Maverick as a middle name? Or Ransom? The second is an oooold Southern name I wouldn‚Äôt give as a first name, but def a middle... there‚Äôs also Alexander as a middle name if you want that forceful sound without the wicked connotations.

A Biblical middle name could be Malachi?"
