CPTSD,f5zjbm3,t3_dpgfel,1572578323.0,"Wow, this group has been so helpful to me.

I have a very emotive face. Itâ€™s happened to me so many times that I will be dissociating and sad and depressed and people, who usually see me at my brightest, will come up to me and the instant they see my face (even though inside I feel like Iâ€™m pulling off the best performance of happiness), theyâ€™ll mirror it. I noticed that. Like...my housemate friends siblings coworkers, they just notice the changes in my mood when im out if it.


Whenever I am in a state of distress, sadness, pain, or dissociating, I almost literally turn *grey*. 

Like, my face gets ashen. And I get very gloomy that I donâ€™t even notice it.

And when people try to call me out of it, Iâ€™ll be blankly staring at them for a second and frowning at them. But itâ€™s not at them, itâ€™s at the memory I am having."

CPTSD,f5scg11,t3_dp1bmy,1572422576.0,"THIS IS ME. 

I thought it was only me. I get really really anxious the day before a really big event and I absolutely canâ€™t sleep. I end up self-sabotaging, and honestly I think itâ€™s because Iâ€™m so scared about the next thing. 

And what sucks that those days, really emotionally intense moments throw me off for days of weeks."
