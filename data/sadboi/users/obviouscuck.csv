OnMyBlock,fkb0eyj,t1_fka7i8q,1584023529.0,exactly. i feel like in retrospect it was a safer ending but i was so mad when i saw that because i had so many questions. hopefully in april they‚Äôll announce a season 4 because i know it has to be at least a possibility bc diego posted on his snapchat to stream the show in order to get a season 4
OnMyBlock,fk6ypmf,t1_fk6yh4l,1583921845.0,exactly! there is no way they would bring up that stuff about monse‚Äôs dad without that being the plot of season 4. especially when they kept talking about the prophets. i refuse to believe that the s3 ending is the series ending. i would get maybe them doing that in case they don‚Äôt get picked up again? but after everyone watched the last episode everyone is gonna know why they‚Äôre all separated so i don‚Äôt even know
OnMyBlock,fk6vt5m,t3_fgpa91,1583918409.0,i really cannot believe they ended the season that way. there has to be another season because there were so many questions and honestly i feel like this was way more of a cliffhanger than last season. it just did not feel final.

Well when his sister, Skye, turned into a teen, kaiden invited her over to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù at his house. Well things got frisky and now they‚Äôre dating, and Kaiden and Alex are in the middle of a HUGE feud. One of the girl children, wynonna, walked in on her dad cheating on her mom with her aunt, and now she refuses to talk to her dad.

bipolar,er4i953,t3_c0g6bl,1560492987.0,"I‚Äôm diagnosed but I have a question for people who have been on medications that worked- I‚Äôve tried a lot of medications (depakote, Abilify, and seroquel) and I didn‚Äôt feel any change but only felt the side effects. How do you know that the medications are actually working, because I just feel even worse when I‚Äôve taken my meds in the past. 

Also another question- I‚Äôve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about 8 months now, and I always feel so bad since I‚Äôm usually with him and he ends up getting the bad end of how I feel. I try writing my feelings down so I don‚Äôt end up lashing out at him but sometimes I just end up being a pretty horrible person. Is there anything else that I can personally do, aside from medication, that could maybe work on so that he doesn‚Äôt get the end of that?
he really is really patient and kind when I do go through my moods, he‚Äôs even bought a book of how to cope with being in a relationship with someone who‚Äôs bipolar. He‚Äôs putting in a lot of effort, and I just want to do the same."
