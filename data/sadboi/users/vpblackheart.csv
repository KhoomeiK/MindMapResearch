Fast forward... my new guy has some REAL self esteem issues about his cock size. During camsex early in our relationship he wanted to see me using my vibrator.

The new man in my life has had a wild and crazy sex life. He is considerably younger than I am but he has had a wide variety of experiences. I haven't asked, but he is very forthcoming in his previous escapades. He enjoys hearing about other people's sexual interests and sharing his own. I am not jealous or upset as we seem to check almost all of each other's boxes.

I think at this point you have to decide if you can overcome your hurt feelings. Do you have the confidence in yourself to ask him what he wants/needs going forward?

He had dated a young woman that was ""saving herself for marriage"" and would only do anal so she could remain a virgin. (right?!)

I don't like it, not interested in ""learning"" to like it. I do like some anal games but no to PIA.

I don't think you should feel bad for not wanting it. Some of us have hard limits to what we will do. My current guy and I have multiple kinks we enjoy and some fetishes as well. It's ok to feel the way you do. Plus, if you are ok with him touching your butt I don't see that as an issue unless he does."

Look for someone that can enjoy me and our time together doing the things that turn each other on? YES"
sex,fqn304m,t3_gjnm40,1589487806.0,"I think your concerns are understandable. But in reality, those women are in his past and they're in his past for a reason.

At my age, it's difficult to find a partner that hasn't had many, many partners. I recently became acquainted with a man in his 40's that has had nearly 300 partners. I'm not saying that's a lot or judging but please consider this as you look into the reasons why you are feeling so insecure about your current partner's past."
sex,fqn26xn,t3_gjpmrp,1589487423.0,"I'm guessing you do NOT taste bad. I've never in my life heard a guy complain or say that. 

If you're healthy and wash properly I'm sure you smell good. Don't let him make you doubt yourself or your body."
sex,fqn1oen,t3_gjo8je,1589487173.0,"I recently began a relationship with a guy with a foot fetish. He loves when I do my nails and send him progress shots.

Like other posters, get a good pedicure. Keep your feet nice by applying lotion every evening before bed. If he really is into feet he'll probably be happy to do it for you! I've also found using about 1/4 of a bath bomb in a pan of warm water really works to soften and invigorate tired feet."
sex,fqmyd4w,t3_gjqh59,1589485588.0,"Since some other folks have hijacked your thread I wanted to actually talk about your concerns.

I too have self-harm scars. With a more recent partner they really bothered him so I kept my top on. It sounds like your boyfriend is wonderfully understanding. Mine aren't quite as extensive as yours, but I don't worry one bit about them. They are part of what makes me me.

Learning to love our bodies can be really tough. Perhaps a low light from a lamp would help you be more comfortable? Or even a tiny little negligee would help? I'm rooting for you!!"
sex,fqmxiwa,t1_fqmjckh,1589485186.0,I'm honestly trying to understand your question. How could you NOT look sexy?
sex,fqmubsh,t3_gjrlq3,1589483659.0,"I'm gonna put this out there. 

New guy and I have done quite a bit of sexting due to the current situation. He isn't too comfortable with the story telling side of things so sometimes I ask about his fantasies and other times I tell about mine in the f\*\*\*\*\* up stories I text to him.

In our case we're fortunate that we have experience to guide us. He has 2 HARD NO limits, so none of my stories would ever include those elements. Luckily, I have the same two. I also have another HARD NO and a soft no.

I did have a sexting only relationship years ago and I let him tell me whatever he wanted because I knew we would never have physical sex.

I can see where it would be difficult to do so without a lot of actual experience. Good luck!"
sex,fqmskmc,t3_gjs3px,1589482822.0,So sweet. Amazing how those little things really add up!
