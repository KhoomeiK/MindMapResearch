BeautyGuruChatter,fhimg3a,t3_f3fmpw,1581627604.0,"Primink begins with stating that LJ is an 18 year old girl from NY, who is an “influencer” that started their page in 2016. 

Her make up skills appear to be basic according to Primink (omg the eyeliner shots), mentions that you’d expect superior make up skills from a guru, but her skills seem to be subpar compared to make up artists with less following. Although on LJ’s websites she was described as a special child, with amazing talents.

He got Disney channel vibes.

Mentions tons of brands were working with her, sponsorships, and that LJ had a billboard with Cover Girl in Times Square, and that she got invited to very exclusive events.

The problem with LJ raises when people begin to wonder who she is. 

Compares LJ’s insta following to that of Laura Lee who has almost 2 million. So, if Laura Lee has 2 mil, why don’t we know about LJ who has almost 1 mil on insta.

Primink mentions the first Reddit post LJ (shout out to the OP), which started it all and found that her followers were bought.

Basically does not doubt that her channel consists of fake followers. 

The infamous photoshopped picture of LJ on Katey Perry’s body at the Met Gala is mentioned. Another photoshopped was one of LJ on a Teen Vogue cover.

The pretend collab with Bite Beauty is brought up, and that the brand asked LJ to stop calling it that. 

Primink makes a joke about Jaclyn Hill’s hairy lipstick lol.

States that LJ’s mom would continue to feed the lies by posting photos and videos. Finds that essentially her mom is creating lies to continue to mislead people.

Goes into the strange fan accounts. These fan accounts area also filled with fake followers according to Primink, and appear to be created by LJ to comment on her real account.

These fan accounts were using photos from Google but claim it was them. 

Finds that not only are these fake friend accounts, but the odd backstory behind each account is alarmingly stereotypical of the type of people they portray . One account is of a muslim girl who struggles to conform to her religion. The second is an unapologetic trans male, who comments “Yassss” a lot. The third is LJ’s best friend who is gay and a designer. Most of these accounts have gone private.

The worst account he found was that of Shaniqua, who was the most racist stereotype of an African American girl you could think of. 

Primink finds out that LJ was homeschooled and the only one who appears to be in her life is her mom.

He has a gun feeling that LJ’s mom is the one playing a huge role in this i.e. pushing for this.

LJ has now lost 200 000 followers on insta, and brands are dropping her. 

LJ’s subpar work has been taking away opportunities from talented make up artists with less of a following. 

LJ’s attitude is what sticks out the most to Primink, The vibe he gets from her is fake and forced - empty character.

LJ and her mom go on a massive tyrade against the haters.

Mentions Lauren Elyse, who’s twitter was suspended. 

Currently, LJ and her mom are purporting that all the rumours are false. 

A streamer channel known as Dangerzone has been defending LJ, in doing so he tried to dox CreepShow Art, who spoke up about LJ. LJ and her mom were cheering this man on (wtf).
