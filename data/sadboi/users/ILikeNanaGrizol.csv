You'll need:  
Tomato  
Feta cheese (in sun dried tomato oil, that's what I used)  
Pesto  
Baby leaves  
Cucumber (If you want them in)  


First, cut your veggies into bite-sized pieces and put them in a bowl (The tomato is the star of the show). Then add some feta (should be approx 1 part feta and 2 parts veggies) over the veggies and put in a spoonful of pesto, or less, pesto is very strong in flavour so up to you how much you want. Lastly you just have to mix it around to coat the veggies in the oil and pesto and voila! Tasty food.  
Can assemble the in the dishware you're gonna eat out of.

You also have my favourite bread dish: Pesto on toast with tomato and salt & pepper.  
Toast bread, put some pesto on as a spread, cut some tomato slices and put them on the toast. Sprinkle with a bit of salt and pepper and you're done.  


These dishes ain't fancy but they are good, and easy."

I don't think the majority of lunar items need reworks, except for effigy (rework it) and beads (make it stack). I would like to see more new and fun lunar items, and a higher spawn rate of cleansing pools (I've lost more lunar coins trying to unlock irradiant pearl than I can count).  


I feel the system is good as is, except for: make lunar coin spawn lower but a constant, obliterate gives you more coins, dreaming costing 1 less coin or something and more than four lunar options in the shop.  


Lunar items are often a lot of fun I usually always pick them up, especially the passives, so new wacky ones would be great."
