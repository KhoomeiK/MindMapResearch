Draco is born into a bloodline that's bad, he belongs to a house that's bad. But he isn't just bad and he proved that when he didn't kill Dumbledore, when he didn't snitch out Harry. And as Sirius said it ""We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.""  
Both Snape and Draco made bad decisions and they did bad things to others, but they weren't all bad and evil. I hate when people go after people that forgave Snape and in the end saw him as a good man. It doesn't mean people ignores the bad and pretends it didn't happen, it's just that they also see the light in him too.   
Umbridge, that woman is pure evil and has nothing good in her. Never once in the books or the movies did she show us something positive. But both Draco and Snape did."

If you put the whole set together in a shelf, it will be striped as the scarfs. So it makes sense that they have black and full colour books. It's like saying the spine of the [2013 Kazu edition books](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZxhrJxaEL.jpg) looks dumb when it's just a random line of a meaningless drawing. But if you put each book together, it forms a photo of hogwarts. It's the same with these books, together they are striped as the scarfs.   
I also love that they aren't doing the same order with both paperback and hardcover, because that way you can get your favorite book in both full colour and black colour. My favorite is Half-blood prince. In hardcover it will be full colour and the paperback will be black colour. I love it, because that means I get both version if I buy them in both.

But the stupid face Voldemort makes in this scene, I hate it so much. I either skip it or close my eyes, because it actually pisses me off way more than it should. There's not much about HP that I truly hate, like gut wrenching hate, but this short scene is that one for me. When I was this movie at the midnight premiere at the movie theater, I said ""What the fuck"" out loud by accident. I've hated it from the first second I saw it. It makes my blood boil.   
[https://youtu.be/rBRfVbP1cyo?t=144](https://youtu.be/rBRfVbP1cyo?t=144)  
The video starts at the part I truly hate. It ruins the whole fight to me. A funny Voldy is not funny! Voldemort is evil, disgusting and horrible, not funny! I HATE IT SO MUCH!   
A black smoke flying around would have been way better. The gripping each others face and yelling and looking stupid ruins it. Especially that part with Voldemort. I wish they released a version where they fixed this and removed those stupid seconds.   
But other than that, I don't mind how it went. They kept the ""Not my daughter, you bitch"" and that's all that matters when it comes to the fight scene for me.

I did like the Nagini twist tho, that one excited me and I hope we learn more about that. The second movie isn't my favorite, but I don't hate it like how I feel anyways, that others do.

Like the marauders, Tom Riddle's beginning and first war, you have the original order of the phoneix and you even have the deathly hallows and Grindewald and Dumbledore. I know FB might touch into Dumbledore vs Grindewald's love story but we don't know where it begins and ends yet.  
It does seem like an odd angle to go through Newt Scamander tho. Especially when we never heard about Newt in the Grindewald and Dumbledore story from the start.

 It's apparently J.K's own idea about the placement in the movies. glad it wasn't in the middle, it looks so dumb. And your version is too bold and wouldn't look great.

To me, it's all about the characters. I can't accept an older Harry, Ron or Hermione with new actors and actress. Never in a billion years if I would accept that. Younger versions, yes. If they keep it true to the original, like their hair color, eye color, ethnicity and their general appearance etc. No Chinese Ron is accepted in my world.

For me, there's one Harry, one Ron, one Hermione etc. You can't mess with the original characters. Add new characters, yes, mess with the old with new actors, no. Yes, I'm weird.
I'm all for more HP as in other characters in a different timeline.I would love movies with a story line about and of the marauders or Tom Riddle, Dumbledore's childhood, a story around the The First Wizarding War etc. I can accept younger version of those characters, if they make it believable.

harrypotter,ffceh01,t1_ffc9cvj,1579797713.0,"How do you survive? I have 4 full sets of the books.
1st is a box set of the first children versions, my first ever copies. Read once, only for display now. 
2nd is a  box set for display because they are too beautiful. Will never read
3rd is, or eventually will be the full set with the illustrated editions.
4th is the full set in pocket that's my reading set, I only use these, and they are going into retirement now, so I need my 5th set. 
And this is me limiting myself. I would love more sets and versions, but I can't. I would rather grow my collection by buying other HP related books, things and collectibles."

There's just too many to chose from. But I'm leaning towards the house editions. Too bad they aren't all out yet tho. Since I can't read them until I have the full set.   
And I love the hardbacks, but also the pocket, so I don't know which one I'm gonna go for yet. Decisions, decisions, so many decisions to make.  ​😂"
Anxiety,ffc7kwp,t1_ffc3mpr,1579793371.0,"I guess the only thing is mediation or distraction, try to calm down your body and muscles. Since the tightening of the muscles makes it way worse, at least in my case. The more I focus on it, the worse it gets. I try to drink a lot when my throat acts up. Since if I can pass water, I can breathe. That's my logic of it and it helps to calm it down a bit. So the only true cure, is to fix what's causing the anxiety, the underlying issue. Which isn't a quick fix, not for me anyway."
harrypotter,ffc3gps,t3_esmu4y,1579790602.0,"My reading set looks the same. I'm planing on retiring it, since my half-blood book has two loose pages in it that's about to fall out. I'm considering getting the house editions in mixed houses as my next reading set. But I'm not sure yet. I might do a box set, but I'm not sure which one, that I'm a bit picky on the art work and I already have one that's too beautiful to ruin/use."
Anxiety,ffc1t8y,t1_ffbzvzk,1579789391.0,"Haven't found a cure. The only thing that works for me is valium or xanax and medication to get rid of any inflammations in my body caused by stress and anxiety.   
This globus-issue is often a mental issue as well. Knowing you wont choke for real, can help you calm down. It depends on how afraid you are of it. I'm terrified, since choking or not being able to breathe is one of my worst fears ever. Seeing someone choke on something, makes me panic for real, it's like a phobia. So these issues triggers my fear and anxiety, which makes it worse. While for you, knowing ""it's just in your head"", you will clam down. So my tip is, if that's the case, that knowing the facts around it will calm you down and the symptoms will go away on its own, then you have your solution. Then you just need to distract yourself, meditate-related exercises and just calm down physically and mentally. If that doesn't work, then meds is the way to go. For me, meds is my only option but I can't take it every time it happens or everyday, due to risk of addiction."

AdultSelfHarm,ff3wmnj,t3_erhrgn,1579550453.0,"Half the time I don't know. The other half I don't really understand to be honest. Since nothing makes sense.   
It's a comfort. It's a punishment. It's a part of who I am and how I function as a human.   
It's a way to make things right again when things are going OK, because I don't deserve OK. It's a way of calming myself when I'm panicking or in emotional pain, like a grounding technique. If I don't feel anything, it makes me feel again. When I feel too much, it makes it run over so I don't feel anything anymore.   
I do it whenever I'm in pain, because I can't handle the pain or myself. I can't deal with it in a normal way, I can't calm down in a normal way. I do it in pain, anger, sadness and frustration. Because I can't handle those emotions on their own, I don't know how or what to do with them, all I know is how to bleed them out and push away the feeling.    
Sometime it's like an idea or an urge that pops into my head, ""I have to cut"", and it wont go away until I do. It's like an itch that can only be removed in one way. Sometimes I do it because I haven't done it in a while and i have to do it. Because I just do, it's a part of my body and it's just a given that I, I cut.   
When the wounds fades into scars, and the pink scars turns white, it's like I'm missing something on my body. This one reminder that I just need, a reminder that I've done good, I've punished myself, I've ruined myself. So when the scars goes away, I have to make a new wound to stay sane.   
It's also like my sick little collection. I need to fill in a spot, or widen a scar, just make it a tiny bit deeper. I don't know why, that's maybe the addiction part?  
Sometimes I cut to make it hurt, but it never hurts anymore. I'm numb to the pain, so I don't get why I cut anymore. It stopped hurting years ago. Cutting for almost 30 years causes that I guess. Sometimes I do it on autopilot, as if it's a given that I cut when I'm in pain... even when it doesn't hurt anymore.   
When I'm in rare, deep, pain and angry, I turn to bruising, because that shit hurts, for days.   
I guess that's my reasons, sort of, I don't know. I might just be completely crazy and cut because I'm 89% psycho or something, I don't understand it half the time. I just cut, bleed and let go of the problem. Rinse and repeat."
harrypotter,ff1ob01,t3_er03td,1579482545.0,"I don't consider it a part of the HP universe. That Harry didn't feel like the real Harry to me. Non of the originals did. It's not the true sequel we deserve, this one has nothing to do with HP.   
But as a stand alone story, it's OK.   
The plot was OK but as the same time sucky. I did love the funny stuff with the main characters. They had their charm and some funny moments. And that's what makes it barely OK to me. But overall it's not a HP story, the original characters are fake and has nothing to do with the real characters and the script sucks.   
I'll never ever be OK with Voldemort and Bellatrix having sex, never ever is that possible! That was the dumbest thing ever, it pisses me off. Because it's like they are making a fool out of the characters. I imagine two 12 year girls writing a fanfiction for their first tumblr page. And one day they are sitting in the back of the classroom at school brainstorming for the fanfic, and giggling over a stupid idea about Voldemort and Bellatrix having sex. It's that dumb. 

Haven't seen the stage show and I don't want to. Not even if I got the ticket for free. I'm not gonna ruing HP for myself in that way.   


I think this whole Cursed Child is embarrassing for JK. She never should have approved it and let Jack Thorne create this and publish it. Since JK didn't write it, he did. But it's her reputation that gets ruined, and that sucks big time. I hate this play/script/book, they shouldn't have messed with HP in this way."

harrypotter,fet43cb,t3_eq5ctk,1579371644.0,"I think she's so bland and invisible in the movies. You hardly notice her. She has a few scenes, but they are just bland and not worth remembering much. Looking back you see a few looks she gives Harry in a couple of the movies, but Harry's interest is just tiny and just a blip in the story line of the movie. Like you don't really get to see the feelings he has for her and the sweet  innocent crush she had on him since before she went to Hogwarts. That part kinda gets lost in the movies you only notice if, if you read the books.   
I just feel like they made Ginny so bland and unnoticeable in the movies. While in the books she has more character, even tho she still lacks a bit in there too. I like book-Ginny way, way more than the movie-Ginny."

Man, saying that out loud makes me sick to my stomach. 20 freaking years, that's a long time. It just sucks that all my friends managed to move on with their life, SH-free... but I'm still stuck in this toxic behavior. It's just so difficult to stop too! Since it's become a part of who I am and how I function as a person. 
But now all of the sudden, it feels so wrong. And I never really thought about it as wrong, it was just how it was and I had accepted it. So strange how I can look in the mirror everyday and see nothing wrong.. and suddenly my eyes opens and I can suddenly see how sick and crazy I look. Like... it's disgusting!"

I had vertigo a few years ago, and it was bad, like worst dizziness I've ever felt in my life. I can't describe it, it's not even ""being on a boat"" or ""laying flat down on your bed heavily drunk-dizzy"" it was... way, way, way worse. Like panicky bad.

These two things, the swallow problem and breathing problem, is for me the worst part of anxiety. I can handle all the symptoms, even the dizziness and muscle pains. But not being able to breathe or swallow, it's terrifying. I've had it so bad my lips has turned blue. The fear I'm feeling when that happens can't be explained in words. This whole heart racing and ""I'm gonna die"" feeling is nothing compared to seeing yourself turn white and your lips goes blue while you can't breathe in or out, it's horrible."

It's mot often the feeling of taking a breath in that's the problem. But sometimes it's the breathing out that's the problem. It's like I'm drowning in old breath, I can't empty my lungs to get new air in and it feels like I'm choking. And then I panic and I can't breathe in or out, it's horrible. It's not like it's hyperventilating that causes this problem, this problem causes hyperventilating. Because it makes me panic. My experience is that people thinks backwards and keep blaming hyperventilating for being the problem, when it's not. This problem is the cause of the panic and hyperventilating. 

It's something I've been struggling with for years, it's the worst part of having anxiety. It gets very claustrophobic and I can't calm down. I then start to get this odd problem of not being able to swallow. So it feels like I'm out of air and drowning in my own spit. Very scary."
