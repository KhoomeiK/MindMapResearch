Just keep going, life is always in motion. Nothing is permanent and realize it’s your mind that is doing this to you. Let your thoughts flow, but remain distant. Do not judge and keep track of the time until it passes. At first it will suck and may not make any sense, and maybe feels like nothings happening. But over time, you’ll start to create it into a habit and your mind will eventually be able to recognize and allow it to become a habit. That’s my best advice. Make it into a habit, a ritual, to let your mind race while you sit back. Reminding yourself of what you are grateful for helps, even if it’s small. Use life to your advantage-don’t feel bad for the way you think. If you think you have it better than someone who has no arms or legs and you feel superior-that’s fine. Realize it’s ok to be selfish for self care (as long as it doesn’t manifest into physical harm to others) and breathe. Count to 5, breathing in, hold it for 6 seconds, then release. Repeat."

depression,fp2j8im,t3_gaxf33,1588262695.0,"No. Statistically speaking there will forever be the normals and then people like me. I die so others may live type of policy. Life is a bell curve and I’m not normal. There’s no hope no actual help and too many goddamn suicide hotline posts. There’s no magical saying or cure. It’s like trying to explain the color red to a person who was born blind. I’m immature, I’m childish, I’m selfish, I’m toxic, ignorant, everything negative. I have to be finished so life can continue. I’m doing the world a favor by getting rid of an annoyance. But I’m not suicidal-that will just land me in the looney bin, further increasing my insanity and depression. Welcome to hell."
depression,fp2iwj3,t3_exo6f1,1588262531.0,"IM SO FUCKING ANGRY, HATEFUL, UPSET, JEALOUS AND EVERYTHING NEGATIVE. IM A DISSAPOINTMENT AND THERES NO CURE. I WILL FOREVER BE THIS LOSER. I HOPE EVERYONE CAN FEEL WHAT I FEEL"
depression,fp2eq5d,t3_gav8bz,1588260478.0,"The only thing is that I use pettiness-if I don’t then I’m a loser like all the losers I know. Or if I don’t get up, then all hope of ever having that AHA moment is lost. I can’t die because then they win. Fuck it."
depression,foyd5bn,t1_foyd0p9,1588170335.0,Lmao they’re all bad. I’ll take my freedom and some dumb homework assignment over not having any freedom and being locked in with a bunch of psychos and not being taken seriously.
