In rec if you’re a solo player you really need to set up a few guys really quickly so that they see you’re not trying to score, because you will not score unless 100% open with all role player badges. If you go with some of the playmaking offensive badges you have a better chance of getting open.

ptsd,eylfas3,t3_cxc8b2,1567183158.0,"Hiya,  CPTSD and just coming out of a three-year-long period of agoraphobia. I totally totally TOTALLY get what you're talking about and how remote work seems like the dream. It was for me... but with grocery delivery, food delivery apps, amazon being available AND remote work, you will slide into that safety and comfort and it will be very difficult to come out of.   


I ended up gaining about 60 pounds, self-isolated until I had no friends, I have no family. When I was finally ready to try and break away from my agoraphobia I got into therapy, had TWO panic attacks on the way and had a very convincing argument given to me that social exposure is really the only way to get over the isolation. So I did it. I started remote working from co-working spaces, cafes, wherever public for a few hours at a time until I felt safer going out and now I'm back in an office 50% of the time.   


I'm still not 100% there, but not working remotely was the first step on the path to getting better. So while I can confidently say I totally understand the appeal of giving into the agoraphobia, I hope you don't. I hope you're able to head this off now while it's easier. (It's not going to be easy, I know. But it'll be more easy than trying to stop in a few years)  


If you need any advice, feel free to PM. You've got this. You're already a survivor, you're already good enough and strong enough just by the simple fact that you're here. Something I'm really focusing on is not worrying about not being afraid, but being afraid and doing the thing anyway. Do it anyway. Go out there and be you. You've got this."

pagan,ews2rqn,t3_cpuoxz,1565719008.0,"This is absolutely where I currently fall. I've been finding real healing power, for lack of a better word... magical healing power, in ritual. But even though I've seen more ""evidence"" in my personal experiences for the powers of magic, I still have that nagging faith issue that drove me out of theism in the first place. 

I think for me it's been less about trying to please a specific diety or follow a specific tradition, and more about finding what feels \*right\* to me. When I perform ritual I feel a connection that I don't feel otherwise, I have a literal feeling of electricity in my veins that I never had with theistic prayer.   


I also tend to look at personifications of deities as parable anyway, so that if I'm seeing tokens or feelings of (just total example) Odin in a curious crow that came to visit, instead of thinking about Odin as a corporal being, I think about the things that traditionally would be handled by Odin. So... if Odin is the All-Father, the God of Wisdom, magic, divination... what does that message mean to me? What does it mean that it's a Norse interpretation of those qualities and not Zeus, or Jupiter? What lessons can I derive from fable and legend specific to their interpretation of those themes?  


But the thing that's really been attracting me to magical practice and ritual is that it's really all about you. There's no eternal reward or punishment, there's just you and the universe working shit out together. But that's just me... maybe not right for everyone else."
oakland,ewp02ya,t1_ewoxebe,1565630513.0,">Not surprisingly, the shiny new bells-and-whistles-loaded complexes popping up are more expensive than older Oakland buildings. The average rent for units of all sizes completed from 2016 to 2019 is $3,915, about 20% higher than units in buildings completed before 2016.  
>  
>Joshua Simon, executive director of the nonprofit East Bay Asian Local Development Corp., said “the current construction boom in Oakland is mostly limited to high-income housing.”  
>  
>“The market demand for people with incomes over $200,000 will be met just fine,” he said. “For people who are doing day care or teaching kids in our schools or working at a nonprofit or cooking in the kitchens of the restaurants that Oakland is justifiably famous for, it’s not providing anything substantial.”

And how does creating more housing for the wealthy help Oakland... at all?   


I'm going to guess there are about 500 units of housing popping up within a few blocks of my house in about six different new construction complexes. No one who lives anywhere NEAR my house will be able to afford a 3k one bedroom. It's not ""hard to know what the breaking point is"" the breaking point is here... this is it. If building housing in a community isn't to assist the community, it's just for profit at the cost of community.   


It's unsustainable and it's driving out anyone who made Oakland something to love. I've spent the last 15 year here, it's more of a home than I've ever had and now I'll have to leave. I'm not alone..."

It's interesting you say that, that's always been my experience too with Ravens and Crows. This weird very spiritual connection with corvids. They seem to always bring me some sort of message, most often just ""it's ok. Everything is ok"" but sometimes it does absolutely correspond to something so directly I'd call it omen. I suffer from pretty bad anxiety and am always calmed by the crows ever since I was a child."
ptsd,ew5d40w,t3_cmpcif,1565133365.0,"I suppose I could offer some thoughts from the other side. I have abandonment PTSD from childhood and it absolutely affects my relationships still.   


One thing, remember that she's not doing this to hurt you. There's an idea of affection permanence in folks with abandonment issues in which once the object of affection is separated from you, you kind of forget that for 99% of the circumstances being gone doesn't mean they stopped loving you, or caring for you. These intrusive thoughts are obsessive, always worst-case scenario, and they never stop.   


It's extremely hard and makes you feel insane. You think irrational things, you say irrational things, you feel irrational things. Something I would suggest is that even if she's absolutely wrong about what she's feeling, to her it is UNQUESTIONABLY real and it isn't fair to you at all, and she knows it, so don't make her feel guilty about it as well if at all possible..   


Just show her as much as you can that you're in this with her. Don't just tell her, show her every chance you get. If you're comfortable with doing so, check with her about how often you can reassure her and send little sweet texts and messages when you think about her. It'll go a long way. I promise.   


Hope that helps you understand what she may be going through."
