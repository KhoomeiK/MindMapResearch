houseplants,fqz25mh,t3_glju6w,1589758567.0,Congrats on sobriety! Your plants look so happy to have you as their dad. Also extra points for the ducks. 😂
MakeupAddiction,fqo03ud,t1_fqnupsc,1589504839.0,"Aww thanks for the sweet comments. When you use your concealer, if used without foundation, is it obvious that there’s makeup just on parts of your face or does it blend well together? I’ll give that a try! It sounds like less work, same results. My kind of tea. ;-) thank you!"
MakeupAddiction,fqntqhl,t1_fqnlsba,1589501226.0,"Thank you! I’ll look into your suggestions, really appreciate it."

vandwellers,fne882s,t3_g0x4b9,1586884779.0,What paint did you use? I’m about to paint the doors on my Ford Econoline and was debating oil or acrylic.
introvert,fnaei9h,t1_fn9gsdw,1586796096.0,I’ve been listening to “Do Nothing” by Celeste Headlee and I highly recommend it.
VanLife,fm96x0m,t3_ftic97,1585862866.0,"Yup! My boyfriend. It’ll take him possibly a month more too to finish our Econoline. But damn, does it look good and every detail has a purpose. Love it. Good work on your van!"
vandwellers,flt7mfu,t3_fqqkij,1585461921.0,Yup! Was also planned to head out April 1st. Staying put and adding more to our van since we have extra time!
mentalhealth,flpo16b,t3_fq47nx,1585364198.0,"Same boat! If anyone has snapchat or wants to dm let me know. We can get through this together. ☺️ 

I actually quit my job before the news came out to go on a road trip across the states. Ironic, right? Since now we are all quarantined in our homes. I have to leave my apt on Sunday to live with my boyfriends sister and her husband until we know what we are going to do. For now, we plan on staying put until this virus goes away. It’s a tough time for everyone in different ways. Change, lack of control, isolation, lack of physical and spacial connection, and, Ykno, constant concern. But I’m here for all y’all too. Feel free to reach out."
vandwellers,flpnh6m,t1_flot0um,1585363796.0,Yep literally said I’m saying home just wanted to hear others perspectives and what they are doing if on the road!

vandwellers,fil7gus,t1_fil6jah,1582495310.0,Splitting the costs with my partner make it possible...and y’know. The no debt thing helps. But yeah. It ain’t cheap. Both of us are thrifty so we are hoping to figure out how to cut costs. I’m a graphic designer so I could potentially get a job remote if I need to. We both have enough saved to at least see where the trip takes us the first few months! Not letting it stop us from trying!
activism,fgu7wzj,t1_fgu1wug,1581114654.0,Thank you! I’ll be hitting the road soon and educating myself with books and conversations along the way. I’ll put this on the list.

vandwellers,ffz1e4j,t1_ffykmaw,1580360841.0,Grew up in Portland as well. Make a few trips to Sauvie Island each year. Must be lovely living there.

vandwellers,ffx871e,t1_ffx4wgo,1580319776.0,We have solar panels on the roof. But that’s a good point. Our plan is to *attempt* to face the van the right direction when we can to not cast as much shadow. I think we will be fine considering the amount we plan to be moving around but thanks for the consideration!
vandwellers,ffwyl50,t1_ffvyww2,1580313920.0,"One of the main reasons we got this specific Econoline was because of the roof rack! It came
with it."

vandwellers,ffwwg83,t1_ffwj5dc,1580312573.0,Yeah we live in Oregon actually. We head out April 1st which means dealing with the gloomy rainy wall of grey for 2 more months 😭😂
vandwellers,ffww8xr,t1_ffwlh81,1580312443.0,Link to what? Very cool! Van buds! 👋
vandwellers,ffww5ol,t1_ffwm2zd,1580312385.0,Roof extended would be ideal. We are heading out full-time in the van starting April first. I’ll fill you in if you’re still on this reddit page on how it feels the first month. We plan on being out more often than in the van for this year and mixing National Parks and city living across the states. It’s definitely not ideal but it’s our first van and we are building it out ourselves and didn’t really mind trying this for starters. It’s also more cost effective and looks less obvious that people may be sleeping in it. If we want to stay in it longer than a year we will probably upgrade. But who knows. Maybe we won’t mind it at all!
vandwellers,ffwvjsv,t1_ffwnzrp,1580311993.0,Yeah I used the wrong word for sure. Whoops. Going to be detecting the best spots to sleep though knowhatimsayin 🕵️‍♀️
vandwellers,ffqo4f1,t1_ffpqxxy,1580139669.0,Very cool. We have the electrical wiring and paneling done if you have any questions we may be able to help out. 👋
vandwellers,ffpptlc,t3_euespd,1580101540.0,My boyfriend and I are building out the same van! When do you plan to have it done by?
mentalhealth,f96tyz0,t3_e3zuep,1575151994.0,"It sounds like you aren’t going to the right people to talk to about this. These people are unable to be there for you emotionally, empathetically, and supportively. I highly recommend going to a therapist. They are able to give real, helpful, and constructive advice that will enable and empower you to work toward the life you deserve. Going to people who are narcissistic, deflect because they don’t know how to be there for you, or abuse their power based on your vulnerable state, are not going to help you in any way (as you are finding out). You are expecting flawed people to be play the role of a healthy therapist and it will lead to disappointment.

Just know you are valid for feeling the way you do and that you can get through this with the right support. I would think on who is healthy and who you trust can support you during this time of transition and reflection. This can be an incredible turning point in self love and worthiness if you reach out to the right people. You deserve the help you are looking for. It’s out there, and the best option is therapy. 

Alongside therapy, getting out and walking, jogging, or anything you enjoy to get your blood pumping really helps with anxiety and depression . I’ve noticed in myself a night and day difference in my overall mood and self worth when I exercise regularly. Don’t go to lose weight, go to help bring sweet sweet serotonin to your brain and to create healthy routines. If you’re into art add that into your life. If you enjoy writing, try writing down how you feel before you go to bed each night. Look at what you’re eating during this time. Make sure you are supporting and taking care of your body not for image but for health. It all plays a role in mental health. You’re in a moment of tons of change and need to create healthy boundaries and support yourself. It can be hard, but it’s very crucial right now in your life to be there for yourself in this way. It also helps to give yourself healthy ways of feeling in control of your life and controlling what you eat (veggies, fruits, nuts, grains, etc), creating routines in self expression and exercise, and other positive habits will empower you.

I can’t sweat it enough how important it is to not go to toxic people in your life for advice and help. It will only make things worse. Know a job is not worth suffering, and that you can carve out the life you desire with the right support. Also this is a very heavy thing for you and may be difficult for your partner to understand. I would recommend going to a therapist for you first, but to also discuss healthy ways of communicating your needs to your partner and exercises you can do together to help get your needs met. But first focus on you. I believe in you."
mentalhealth,f96q64c,t3_e43ge9,1575149779.0,"You’re being way too hard on yourself. You care, and you genuinely want to be there for her. That’s enough. Please take care of yourself, too. It’s hard to be there for someone else if you are not sleeping and if you are too anxious. If you have sleep paralysis often, it’s healthy and great to set a boundary for her to when you can actually reach her. What she’s going through may be very tough for her, and if you want to be there for her, be realistic and honest with yourself when you can be. This approach is healthy and sets both of you up for healing and support. 

Again, you missing her call is okay. It doesn’t mean you don’t care and it doesn’t mean you are a failure. It’s human. Just set a more honest boundary of when is the best time for a phone conversation if you feel the need to give a time slot. Setting honest boundaries can be hard, but it’s fulfilling and sets both people up for being respected and being able to follow through. 

Take care of yourself my friend!"
mentalhealth,f96oy6c,t3_e405go,1575149150.0,"You’re 23. I’m also 23. The knowledge I have found is that these years are a rollercoaster of trials and tribulations. Things that have helped me are learning what my values are, creating healthy boundaries and staying accountable to them for my own health and health of relationships, and most importantly being loving and forgiving myself for being super hard on myself. We aren’t supposed to have everything figured out right now. The world seems so big and choices seem so important so just know you are not alone in these worries. It all feels very heavy and we must spend this time in our life honoring the worth of ourselves, pouring ourselves a hot cup of tea, and giving our mind a bit of rest from the anxieties and fears that keep us in a loop of feeling confused and unworthy.

If you feel you need someone to talk to or have in your life I definitely recommend therapy. It’s been insanely helpful for me. If you can’t afford it, volunteering has benefited me too. There are also many groups on Meetup that are free and bring people together with similar hobbies which I’ve done a few times.

I believe in you! You aren’t alone in this. It’s a tough world out there but you’re more capable than you think. Much love to you."
