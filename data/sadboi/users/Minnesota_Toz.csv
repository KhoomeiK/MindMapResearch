minnesotaunited,fddxwds,t3_eku0hz,1578326644.0,"Hey everyone, I have had an idea for the future of soccer in america and I've been waiting for a free talk monday to talk about it.  


Here me out because I think it's a good idea but I also know it would never work.  


Scrap the MLS and combine all soccer leagues on a state by state basis.  Each state has a divisional structure with promotion and relegation with league size dependent on state size/team participation.  Leagues follow the same dates as the MLS through spring, summer, fall with state champions crowned AND NO PLAYOFFS.  The smallest US state is the size of Belgium so I think state leagues would easily get enough teams, i am aware that north dakota may not have the same quality of league as california.  


My idea for a ""US cup"" is the leagues would be broken into 4 conferences based on geography with a full FA Cup sized knockout competition played annually in each conference with a regional champion crowned.  The 4 winners of this cup proceed to a semi final and then a final to crown the US champion, semi finals played home and away with final held in a neutral venue equidistant from both final teams home cities.  I think having state soccer leagues and then a seperate cup to crown an overall champion of america would work well, the two finalists then qualifying for the NA champions league."

**Quick adjustments in OBS**

* Typically stick to Veryfast encoding when using x.264
* Enable Dynamic Bitrate (this worked amazingly for me and I highly recommend enabling this)
   * Setting -> Advanced -> Network -> Enable dynamically change bitrate
* Enable “new network code”
* Minimize animated/browser sources
* Make sure webcams are formatted to 720p

**Disabling windows game bar and game mode (I haven't done this, source of this info in link below)**[https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/wiki/How-to-disable-Windows-10-Gaming-Features](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/wiki/How-to-disable-Windows-10-Gaming-Features)

* Disable windows game bar (DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE NVENC ENCODING, see below)
   * Settings App -> Gaming -> Game bar -> set record game clips, screenshots and broadcasting game bar -> OFF
   * Settings App -> Gaming -> Game bar -> Game DVR/Captures -> OFF
* Globally disable windows game mode (DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE NVENC ENCODING, see below)
   * Windows key + R
   * Type RegEdit and hit enter
   * Navigate to HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\software\\microsoft\\gamebar
   * Look for AllowAutoGameMode
   * Set the value to 0 (Zero)
   * If AllowAutoGameMode doesn’t exist right click inside the panel select new DWORD (32 bit) value and rename the new key to AllowAutoGameMode

**USING NVIDIA ENCODING INSTEAD OF CPU x264**

We used this for my wife's stream only, I still use CPU encoding as I am a food streamer and don't run games while I stream.

[https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/broadcasting-guide](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/broadcasting-guide)

**Pros:**

* Unbelievable high end performance at 6k bitrate
* Reduction in CPU use
* GPU encoding is optimised in RTX graphics cards

**Cons:**

* At lower bitrates there can be image quality loss compared to CPU x264 encoding

**Things to note:**

* OBS Studio is more optimised for NVENC encoding than streamlabs
* Set stream to 60 fps and a higher bitrate than 1500 to begin with
* Nvidia says to keep windows game mode active instead of turning it off when using GPU encoding

**Using Nvidia encoding simple settings**

* Base canvas and scaled canvas -> set to 720p
* Downscale filter -> Lanczos
* Bitrate -> variable based on your internet speed, I stream at 4k
* Encoder preset -> max quality

**Using Nvidia encoding advanced settings**

* NVENC H.264 (new)
* Enforce streaming service encoder -> check
* Base canvas and scaled canvas -> set to 720p
* Downscale filter -> Lanczos
* Bitrate -> 6k (if you have low upload speeds use around 3k)
* Keyframe interval -> 2
* Encoder preset -> max quality
* Profile -> High
* Look-ahead -> do not check
* Psycho visual tuning - check
* GPU -> 0
* Max B-frame -> 2"
