Sometimes I'll do some stuff with higher intensity but not as often. If i feel like i wanna push harder one day i will but if I don't, I don't. It stops me burning out.

Some of it is getting used to it too though i think, especially when you start to feel gains. Like when you can feel your form getting stronger on a pushup or plank. Or the other day i was on my bike and was wondering if i was even getting a workout because I'd just pumped my tires and it was so easy, usually im drenched in sweat from being on flat tires lol, but my heart rate was definitely still up, it just felt easy and good.

I don't run because of joint pain but i can cycle for some time. I also love working on my flexibility, I'd love to be good enough for contortion some day."

EDAnonymous,fqu782i,t3_gkz2sb,1589653368.0,"I was 14 and my family moved to india from england. It was supposed to be for 6 months but my dad lost his job and had to find a new one that would be willing to pay to relocate us all back. All of a sudden we were stuck there. I really struggled at school because of the higher grade thresholds as well as them being ahead of me in terms of curriculum. I wasnt close with my fam at the time and they were having their own issues at the time. I was desperate to go back to my friends and bf in england.

I tried to find a way to make money so I could pay for a plane ticket to visit home. I knew a girl at school who knew a bunch of college guys (in their 20s). They said they could get me work promoting club events, and they always paid for my entry everywhere and bought me drinks and got me drunk. They'd take advantage of me sexually but i thought it was worth it if i could visit home. Anyway i never got paid and eventually i realised i was just being played. I got harassed in public by men often too.

All in all i was so miserable and really not ok in any sense, it was darkest time of my life and i didnt know how to get help or where to turn and felt very alone, i did sh at first until my mum found out and cried her eyes out so i decided to stop that but put everything into starving myself instead because I couldn't express how i felt but i thought i could at least show how i was feeling on the inside on the outside. And my parents didnt really question it.

 I felt really big and ugly next to all the  smaller and slimmer indian girls as well. At the time i was on tumblr and my friend was posting about her ed and a lot of thinspo and stuff. That's how i got into it, because if i was obsessing about that, I wasn't thinking of anything else, so it was my coping mechanism.

I did eventually get back to England after a year. My friends fed me up over the period of about a year (they got very protective over me, they were pretty dysfunctional in their own ways but often tried to shield me from it) and since most of the sources of my misery were gone i was pretty much recovered after about 3 years mentally.

Haven't had any major relapses since in terms of physical weight, just the mental stuff and disordered eating (restricting), usually when im stressed. I'm 24."

You 100% still belong here, and you still would even if you hadnt started restricting prior to the sexual trauma.
