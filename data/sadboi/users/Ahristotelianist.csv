Ori deals less in a single rotation but all her abilities are AoE and her Q is on an extremely low CD.

My best advice is just take a break from Leona (or League in general) and lay your mind off of her for a while. Come back a week or two later with a refreshed mind and you might feel better. This is what I did whenever I felt like my performance on a champion was deteriorating.
