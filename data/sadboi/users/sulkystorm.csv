 I've read an interesting article some time ago that explained why people with these disorders attract each other and choose each other as partners. Although this article is talking about borderlines and narcissists, it still answers why we fall for those who are fucked up in the reverse way than we are.

To generalize and shorten it; borderlines, narcissists and most people with personality disorders all lack intimacy skill because of their inability to see things as both bad and good at the same time.

If it's possible, I'd suggest you trying to spend more time with the crush to see their flaws. Just observing, and constructing a real human image of them, they are not god, either a demon. 

First infatuation is normal for people, it's problematic if it persists tho. Try to ask yourself what's missing from your life, what are you trying to compensate with this intense fantasies. This is your kind of drug, and abuse of drugs always stems from being unsatisfied, disconnected from something. 

Good luck and may you enter new decade with fresh boundaries and goals to rebuild your behaviour that does no longer serve you."

I do know it happened, but not sure when exactly. So for example, when I'm asked when I started studying at that school, I'm like ""uhhh, about 4, 5 or 6 years ago?"" I'm guessing. It is kinda frustrating, because I'd like to know.

But can conclude 2010s were revolutionary for me. I went through hella toxic stage. Weed addiction, relationship based on codependency, social anxiety rising to the point where I wasn't able to do groceries alone. Isolation was so bad for me I lost contact with almost all my friends, but since 2017 things are starting to improve. I started getting better at confronting issues, no longer am addicted to weed or tobacco. I dumped the dysfunctional relationship, and am now more careful about who I let enter into my life. Social anxiety transformed from unbridled, life swallowing monster that was forming my prison to a tiny annoying devil on my shoulder, still sometimes whispering me how I can't do stuff.

I often forget through what hell I went to be able to be this version of self. Although with now broken heart, I can say I'm looking forward to the new era, to continue letting go of what doesn't serve me well, to learn listening to my inner voice which always told me how to do things right, but I stubbornly haven't listened. Just to try and be better, be empathic towards myself and others more, judge less, be present more, and also accept the possibility of failing."
