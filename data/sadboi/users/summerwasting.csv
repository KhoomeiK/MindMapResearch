I have to say, reading through these comments... it‚Äôs surreal. I sometimes can‚Äôt believe this is my life and this is what I‚Äôm like. I hate it. I hate that i have this disorder. I hate that I‚Äôm mentally ill. I don‚Äôt like the stigma, the pain that my feelings cause me, and I‚Äôm so scared of being alone forever. This disorder is so, so isolating and painful. To see the way people in this thread talk about sufferers is traumatizing in and of itself. However, i totally get it and i don‚Äôt blame them.
