Look at the graph yourself. There is literally no other country that looks like that. They reported an exponential rise in cases up until around Feb 12th, then the curve literally flattens. I have a background in epidemiology and infectious diseases, and this is not how any infectious disease curve looks like.

I am not saying they are straight up hiding the numbers for political gain. Tbh, it could be a lot of reasons for this, including a sudden severe drop in testing. But these numbers literally make no sense, and I'm tired of hearing on here over and over again that anyone who thinks China is fallible is a capitalist shill.

politics,fmzsmsk,t1_fmzh2gw,1586528704.0,"""America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, 'It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.

Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.""

TrueAskReddit,fmz45pa,t3_fxworf,1586505694.0,"Personally, I would choose to focus on the word ""expect"" here. Expect from who? The masses? Why would they harbor such expectations to begin with?

The problem is not with expectations, it's with enforceability. As long as you have an ambiguous expectation that can't be enforced, then it really doesn't matter whether they're donating to charity or not, from a material perspective.

The whole concept of charity hinges on the idea that there always, under all potential circumstances and realities, be people in need of help. I personally don't believe that to be the case. People are in need BECAUSE of the lack of regulation of the very wealthy. Charity can be abolished altogether if there was a more enforceable and organised effort to end suffering."

Because HIV has a really long latency period potentially (depending on what meds the patient takes, or even if they have access to antiretrovirals), it won't really capture the scope/severity of the illness. It's also primarily an STD, which means transmission isn't going to be the same as respiratory diseases or viruses that are transmitted through most other body fluids. So to get an accurate understanding of the severity of HIV you need longer than 100 days."

What if people who have contracted it have a much higher risk of developing lung cancer or autoimmune disease? We wouldn't know that yet because it's too early to tell. We know now that a lot of people who got infected have lost their sense of smell (indefinitely). Is it affecting the brain? We don't know. And we shouldn't be taking any chances."

I wonder how long it took for the first SARS-CoV-2 death to identified, since the virus is novel and testing wasn't readily available. The lag in identifying the first death may contribute to why coronavirus has much higher numbers since ""day 0"" would already have been after the virus was extensively spread and months after the ""true"" day 0. All those diseases probably also have a lag period in identifying first death, but it's easier in some cases than in others. For example, ebola patients have symptoms that are practically pathoneumonic (bleeding from multiple orifices), or at least limited to a handful of viruses. SARS-CoV-2 on the other hand has symptoms that are commonly seen in respiratory illnesses in general, making it more difficult to intuitively diagnose/differentiate."

But to address the actual topic: I would challenge P2. You can accurately say that there is no material harm to not believing in Allah, but actual harm? Assuming that God is a jealous God (as is my understanding of God in monotheistic religions) then it seems that P2 might be causing other forms of harm, harming God's ego or ability to conduct himself. I would say that this diminishes from God's ""godly"" qualities, but nonetheless... If humans were specifically put here to ""serve and worship"" then that itself has no material benefit to God. So clearly God is not necessarily interested in what benefits him from a material sense. It must be that God gets something else, some other benefit, from us believing in him and serving him. Otherwise, what's the point? So since God is not interested in material benefits, it is possible that there are immaterial harms that come from disbelievers."

There must be prerequisites to creation, like building a building. The foundation comes first. You can't make humans without first making the laws of nature. Laws of nature wouldn't just happen randomly, as far as I can tell they must be set and tuned since they're extremely specific (the speed of light, the effects of gravity, etc). If God just creates, and there are all these things that he doesn't create that just happen to ""happen"", that to me seems the equivalent of a poor programmer who only puts in half the code.

The website you posted is hell on mobile. Not sure if I'll have access to a computer soon, but once I do I'll check it and get back to you.

As for what I was saying, check this out: https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56. The author is not an epidemiologist per se, but this is easily the best explanation I have seen and I've read a lot on the topic. He also cites references, so you can see where the data is coming from yourself. If you'd like more resources, I could send some. 

Regarding what assumptions can be made: this is especially tricky. We pretty much need to take all assumptions with a grain of salt. There's a lot we know about the virus (and virology in general) compared to where we were in the wake of, say, the Spanish flu, but a novel virus is just that... Novel. We can only know so much in a few short months of hysteria. But we know the economic toll it has had on countries thus far. Low case numbers could mean many things. Could be under reporting, could be under testing, could be genuine decreases in numbers, but it's really hard to say what the ""causes"" are from country to country. Most likely, it's a mix of those factors and more. What do relatively low numbers in Sweden mean? I don't know. I'm not sure anyone does right now. But let's take Sweden as an example: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/

Closed cases: 121. Recovered: 16 (13%). Deaths: 105 (87%)

Deaths in 87% of reported closed cases? If SARS-COV-2  killed 87% of infected people as a whole, the death toll would be 500k right now. So why is their death rate so high? Could be that they're only testing people who are on the verge of death, in ICU beds with doctors unsure of the cause of their respiratory illness. That's one possible explanation, but there are others. When we're looking at actual strategies that work, however, we should look at Singapore and South Korean models imo. But on that same vein, let's look at the South Korean data: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/

Closed cases: 4,955. Recovered: 4,811 (97%). Deaths: 144 (3%)

Deaths in 3% of reported closed cases? How could that be? How is the difference between South Korea and Sweden so massive? They've had 40x the number of cases, but have almost the same amount of deaths as Sweden. I will tell you right now, it simply does not add up. There's no virus in the world that acts this differently in different countries, so it can't be due to the virus. They both are lauded as having some of the best healthcare systems in the world, so it's not like they have a huge difference in quality of care. Realistically, it has to do with who's being tested and how testing is conducted. Only one thing is for certain: there is no standardisation. There are no guidelines (there are a few here and there that have been popping up, but they're all tentative AFAIK). That lack of standardisation makes it difficult to parse out what it happening. And the lack of transparency makes it difficult to know how healthcare professionals are selecting testing methods.

The US and UK don't want to shut down. It's not like it's in their conservative governments' favor to tell people to stay at home. It's Hail Mary time. Throw things at the wall and see what sticks. Because if they do not, there's looming catastrophic consequences that will undoubtedly unfold."

The problem is that this isn't the flu. It's much, much more dangerous, especially in the elderly. What that means is a lot more people requiring intensive care and hospitalisation. If it's allowed to continue to spread, eventually enough people get hospitalised that medical systems get overrun. This has been the trend everywhere so far with severe outbreaks including the US, Spain, Italy, regions in China, etc. Once you have all your beds occupied with COVID patients, what happens to your other patients? They die, since there are no beds for them. It exhausts medical supplies, staff, equipment, and pretty much all other medical utilities. So really, to treat this like the flu will do 2 things: it will lead to a huge surge of deaths (especially in the elderly), and it will deny healthcare facilities governmental support that will be direly needed.

vegan,fl9fph0,t1_fl8h5c7,1584953609.0,Amen brother/sister. Thanks for that
vegan,fl9f8yh,t1_fl8igqp,1584953008.0,"Yeah, if the sign had said that we wouldn't  be having this conversation. Clearly to a lot of people here it sounds nitpicky since I'm downvoted to oblivion, but there's a huge difference between the two sentiments. It doesn't take away from the message/gravitas, but I don't think we should settle for inaccurate messages especially when there's a risk of us looking like idiots."
vegan,fl8i27p,t1_fl8huqe,1584924165.0,Of course it does. My problem isn't with that assumption. My problem is with saying that SARS CoV 2 was specifically caused by animal consumption when in reality it could have happened and propogated even without animal consumption. There's a big difference between causation and association.
vegan,fl8fr6w,t1_fl8fdpj,1584922658.0,"It's the commonest theory at the moment, but it's too early to say that that is definitively the case. Even if we do assume that it is absolute truth, there's an implication that if people didn't eat meat the COVID epidemic wouldn't happen, and that is not necessarily true at all."
vegan,fl8dzdn,t1_fl8bdcl,1584921517.0,"Thanks for your thoughts. I didn't find most of it relevant to the actual discussion on cross-species transmission, but they're poignant nonetheless. There's one specific thing I want to address though: unfortunately (and I truly mean unfortunately) we do need to care how carnivores see our movement. I was a carnivore not too long ago. I'm willing to bet a lot of us here were. I'm not a carnivore today because of how veganism was presented to me. If vegans continued to follow the PETA line, imho the movement would have been severely stifled. It matters. It matters because the more vegans in this world, the less suffering, and of this I am certain. Again, though, not specifically relevant to was originally being discussed. 

Where I live, there are no vegans. There are no vegetarians. My family and my in-laws treat me with indifference at best, and disdain at worst. The few friends I have think I'm mentally ill (which I am, but not because I'm vegan). How do you change a society that is so fundamentally different? I'll tell you right now, it's not by showing them a post like this one. I'm familiar with the culture in Vancouver and BC, and it is WILDLY different from the vast majority of the world. Maybe they would be more understanding. I still think it's vital that we treat the vegan cause with the sternness that is required, and educate with verifiable facts. There are so many reasons to be vegan, but COVID is not one of them."
vegan,fl8ac6l,t1_fl82dn4,1584919230.0,"I'm not discussing whether animals are living in their own feces or not or whether they're tortured. I'm not talking about animal cruelty. None of that is even up for debate - it's why I'm here in the first place and why I don't eat them. I'm talking about viral transmission and cross-species transmission specifically. 
But what is relevant is the number of humans interacting with those animals, and vice versa. You could have 30 billion animals, but if there's limited interactions with humans the chances of cross-species transmission is slim. That's what I mean when I say it's not about the raw numbers."
vegan,fl878hc,t1_fl851y3,1584917337.0,"You wanted nuance, so let's talk nuance: 

It might not be your experience that you've met vegans who live with animals, but I sure have. I live in a country where animals are severely mistreated (many animals are considered unlucky and are abused, etc). I have volunteered in shelters myself. The point is not to malign people for surrounding themselves with animals, or to allocate blame. That's my point. The random mutation of a virus isn't something you can allocate blame for. It is strictly random chance. Eating meat or not eating meat, it could have happened either way. Yes, on average, if the entire planet went vegan (assuming all other factors remain constant) there will likely be a drop in cross-species transmission, but that's strictly because we're assuming all else stays constant. The assumption is: no animals husbandry / agriculture --> less animals --> less interactions with humans. But it could easily be the case that those assumptions become challenged as our world changes for a whole host of reasons. Could the number of interactions stay the same even if the entire planet stops eating meat? It's unlikely, but it is theoretically possible if there are major cultural shifts, for example. That's what I'm getting at. It cannot just simply be reduced to ""do not eat meat"". 

I already said I agree conceptually with the example you stated about throwing the darts. That's not part of the discussion, or my point. My point is simple: educate people correctly. Not with buzzwords. Not with claims. With actual, empirical science. Otherwise, we're the ones who will look like idiots. The cards and world are already stacked against us. Just look at what has happened in grocery stores. This isn't the time for pseudo-scientific lingo. We're better than that. This isn't the time for inaccuracies. If we want to be taken seriously, we need to act like it and speak like it. If you want to live in an echo chamber where all your values are echoed back to you, that's your prerogative, but that's not going to change the world. Nobody who is non-vegan is going to read this sign and say ""wow, these vegans sure know what they're talking about"". 
What if they're wrong about it being food-borne? The evidence so far is very early and still has plenty of room to shift. What then? Then, again, we look like ill-informed idiots. We still can't even definitively say what ""caused"" HIV, and people want to talk about what ""caused"" SARS-CoV-2? Seriously? We are already suffering with our public image, which makes a difference in how influential we can be and how convincing we are to the general public (which then translates to actual, real change in reducing meat consumption). We do not have the luxury of worsening that image, for the sake of the animals who need us. If we're serious about changing the world, we need to take it seriously and not peddle half-truths."
vegan,fl850tr,t1_fl83qmx,1584916008.0,"Actually, you're the person using fallacious arguments. This has nothing to do with how many billions of animals wallow in their own feces. Everyone in this sub understands the scope of that problem, and it's a big reason of why we're here. We're talking specifically about cross-species transmission. Viruses don't care if you're wallowing in filth, that has nothing to do with the evolutionary process that leads to these mutations. It's random chance (Darwinian evolution and natural selection). The reason why it's less likely to happen with pets and pet-owners are because: 

1. Most pets are not the kinds of animals that typically have viruses that are prone to jump into human hosts. There are specific animals that confer characteristics that make them candidates for that (bats, camels, civets, and others), even though it can theoretically happen. 
2. Even if you spend all day every day with one animal, it is not the same as, say, spending 12 hours with 2 animals, or 8 hours with 3 animals. There is a correlation between number of interactions and the chances that a mutation will occur that can be transmitted to another species (like humans)."
vegan,fl83xvb,t1_fl82x6i,1584915371.0,"I agree with you on proof, that's the whole point. Why are we sensationalizing the issue and with purposefully simplistic signs in the first place? This isn't education. This isn't how you get a point across. Vegans will just agree, non-vegans will just disagree, and we would get nowhere. It's self-defeating, and makes us look bad in the long run."
vegan,fl82wxp,t1_fl827nr,1584914769.0,"Honestly, I thought this community of all communities would be open to a scientific discussion. This is a community that prides itself with not living with the cognitive dissonance of other communities, and yet all I see regarding COVID is propaganda and buzzwords. It's unbelievably disturbing to me as a scientist."
vegan,fl81usi,t1_fl818f2,1584914131.0,"To say that something ""causes"" something else is a very serious claim. It's so serious that it's rare in scientific literature in general. We rarely speak in those terms even when we talk about common pathologies we claim to understand, like diabetes. Causation is extremely difficult to prove, and some argue that it may be impossible to prove. So we can agree to disagree. 

But for food-for-thought, take a look at the Bradford-Hill Criteria for Causality. It is an epidemiological concept on how to better understand where something actually causes something else, whether they're associated, whether there's something else causing them both, etc. This may seem like it's in the realm of abstraction or even semantics, but the way we discuss these things matters."
vegan,fl80xg1,t1_fl7zsoo,1584913572.0,So we're supposed to accept messages that are potentially misleading because the truth is too difficult to put on a sign? Because there's no room for nuance? That's a real slippery slope.
vegan,fl7yqbl,t1_fl7y6xm,1584912232.0,"I absolutely do agree, but that's not the message being dished here, in my opinion. They should put it that way, and not say that eating animals is the reason we're in this mess."
vegan,fl7yjzt,t1_fl7vkhe,1584912124.0,"It has nothing to do with the raw number of animals. It has to do with the number of interactions humans have with animals. The less interactions, the less chance of cross-species transmission. But if you're a vegan who surrounds themselves with animals, there's still a real risk of cross-species transition. This post is just a vegan circle-jerk that is purposefully pushing a misleading message and making US look bad in the eyes of the scientific community."
vegan,fl7y36j,t1_fl7xp8k,1584911836.0,That's not necessarily true. It's strictly related to exposure. Vegans have the same risk IF they're being equally exposed through other means (e.g. a vegan living around and surrounding themselves with wild animals). That's why it's misleading.
depression,fl7qa2t,t3_fn1vc8,1584907088.0,"I'm not coping, really."
vegan,fl7pbgl,t1_fl7nql7,1584906508.0,Exactly right
vegan,fl7ovrg,t1_fl7ntak,1584906247.0,Exposure comes from more than what you eat. You can be exposed to animals as a vegan.
vegan,fl7j02n,t1_fl7g6hs,1584902726.0,"The pattern is that any exposure to animals carries risk of cross-species transmission. That could come from the animal husbandry and agricultural industry, but it doesn't have to. Spontaneous mutations can come from anywhere."
vegan,fl7ip0g,t3_fn13dn,1584902545.0,"Guys, I love you, but this is ignorant. I have a background in epidemiology and pharmacy (pharmacoepidemiology). Pandemics can happen, regardless of whether the agricultural industry exists. So long as there is ANY contact with animals, zoonotic transmission can and will occur. It's the inevitability of evolution. Limiting our contact with animals helps reduce that risk, but not diminish it entirely, and to suggest that we can prevent outbreaks by just not eating meat is not factually correct in the slightest. When people say ""COVID-19 could have been avoided if everyone was vegan"" is technically correct about SARS-CoV-2 but what's being implied is that COVID-19 could not have occurred ever if everyone was vegan. That isn't true. It certainly could have. It happens to be that in this case, eating meat was a catalyst, but the vast majority of viruses that infect humans are zoonotic in origin, and that will continue to be the even if we shut down every single farm on the planet.

Animal exploitation didn't CAUSE SARS-CoV-2. Mutations in the virus caused it. Exposure to animals is not a cause, it is a catalyst. There is a vital distinction."
