""Its pointless,"" he sighed.
He zipped up his jacket and turned away from me. ""Lets go.""
""Just leave!"" He yelled, slaming the door.

Get creative with yr words. Maybe describe their voice or the emotions in it."
Christian,fbdmwdd,t3_ectu2m,1576766516.0,"Just some things to keep in mind
1. Everyone dies
2. Christians should be prepared for persecution
3. God does not promise that following him is easy
4. The devil is always trying to act against you, tempting you, trying to lead you astray, making bad things happen to you, in attempt to try and turn you away from God. Maybe it was satan trying to turn them away in the face of death, or turn someone else away seeing a Christian die.
It could be God trying to do something. In fact, God always has a plan, and he might be using their death to shape someone else.

I hope this helped somehow"

Try talking to someone who you are sure won't judge you and who cares about you. Just tell them how you feel, and ask them to listen. There may be an underlying cause to your issue, maybe trauma, parental influence, etc, but it's more important to just get what you're keeping inside out first."
