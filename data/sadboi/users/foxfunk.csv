Wash upside down with Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus shampoo every other wash (wash every other day). Use Cantu Shea Butter conditioner and comb through with a wide tooth comb upside down then wash out with warm water. Then use Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus conditioner and wash out with cold water. 

I squeeze out the water with my hands till its not dripping wet, then put Cantu curling cream in with light praying hands. I then squish with a t-shirt, and plop in a microfiber towel for as long as possible (my hair takes forever to dry). Then I'll diffuse my hair till its mostly dry (I diffuse with my hair plopped on top of a towel on my bed upside down cause I struggle keeping curl patterns higher up my hair). Then I separate my parting and spray with hair spray when its dry.

I can't use too much product on my hair cause it weighs it down a ton would appreciate any suggestions for hair that struggles holding a curl pattern."

A controversial one - he's a heavy smoker, and he's obese, and that makes me really worry about his health. The guy can't bend down to tie his shoes he has to tie them first then put them on. He also gets way too exhausted during *certain* activities, to the point where I was really concerned he was going to have a heart attack the one time. 

Also, he was in a relationship with a woman for 13 years and they never moved in together, never got engaged, never had kids. They went years sometimes without sex. I just don't get how you can not even move in together after that long, even if you don't want to get married or have children. It makes me concerned that he's complacent, too laid back and unwilling to put any effort in. 

There are other things too, but the first are obviously enough grounds for splitting, in my opinion anyway. 

Now he's saying to me ""I probably won't be able to see you for 6 months at least due to the Coronavirus"". I don't know where this figure of 6 months came from. I'm really not wanting to be with him as it is, but I was planning to cut things off in person. I don't want to make him wait 6 months to see me, but I also don't want him to think I just cba waiting 6 months. I want him to know its more than that.
