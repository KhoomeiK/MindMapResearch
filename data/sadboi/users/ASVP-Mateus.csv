I’m on PC now, although I played the majority of my gta career on Xbox, I’m level 70 on pc but I’ve played every heist at least 5 times and doomsday 30+. 

One thing you can rely on me with is never giving up, I’ve been in too many situations trying to grind it out and someone gets bored or just gives up, i will sit there and restart as many times as it takes.

I think trying to get CM on the Fleeca Job first would be best, learn how to communicate and time things before we go for a big job.
