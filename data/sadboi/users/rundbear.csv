That said, I agree a forfeit feature should be there, but still I'd like to see it somehow say to players 'try playing 4v5, if it just doesn't work, you can forfeit np'. For example enabling the feature after you lose 3 rounds in a row when you're at a disadvantage.

Edit: I want to add that a forfeit feature gives people an excuse to give up just because they're not disciplined or patient enough. I play Rocket League sometimes, and almost 50% of the time whenever my random team gets scored on, at least one team mate will insta vote-forfeit, even though the score is 0-1 and there's 4 minutes left on the clock... (RL matches last 5 minutes) and I just can't grasp these people's thinking.
