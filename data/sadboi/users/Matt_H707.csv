DunderMifflin,foxlcax,t1_fnggjth,1588147645.0,Thank you for expressing your opinion like a civilized being and not hurling dung like so many do on the internet.
depression,fovmkeh,t3_g9ndgw,1588103851.0,I feel like antidepressants made me dead inside even after I quit.
depression,fk3l6lq,t1_fk3iqig,1583838365.0,"Yea, I used to see therapists but have become extremely jaded at this point by their often repetitive attitudes. I do therapize myself (although sometimes I’m just like “no mercy for the weak in the cruel world”) or something, so I don’t know how great I am at that. 
I think I just might need more time and practice self reliance."

DunderMifflin,fjn4yba,t1_fjn4rxy,1583498042.0,Haha That’s what she said！

Persona5,fhm96uh,t3_f3awzr,1581709831.0,My alarm is an air raid siren. You better believe I’m up and across the room within 4 seconds of it going off! Very effective I recommend.
anime,fh1z222,t1_fh1yvsm,1581228723.0,Lol ye but they got banned from the subreddit I think.
depression,fh131sg,t3_enrs4c,1581210341.0,"Yea, it’s a problem for me. When I talk about my real feelings I get sad and angry and people complain or try to “fix it” so I usually just stuff it down. Also I feel there is a stigma against emotionally expressive men, especially when it comes to the tougher feelings. I also feel at risk for being compared with people in my family who are emotionally manipulative. Whenever I tell my mom I’m upset she says “you were fine a minute ago” it’s so frustrating. Like I’m not fine just because I pretend to be."
Naruto,fh0z58a,t3_f0zngm,1581209122.0,You should keep this up dude! Really great design♨️
anime,fh0wg52,t1_fh0uwp3,1581208289.0,"Ya sure I’m insecure, nothing wrong with that as like as I don’t take it out on others like you do. Your username, I can’t expect someone as primitive as you to get this but using gay synonymously with lame is the same as saying gays are lame. And why would you be on this forum If you hate anime fans, only way I see it is you wanted to fw someone. I’m glad I could give you what you were looking for😇."
anime,fh0vidq,t3_f0jcxi,1581207963.0,"a.) Ya sure I’m insecure, nothing to be ashamed about as long as I don’t punish others for my own insecurities like you. b.)Look at your username! When using gay synonymously with lame you are insulting the gay community. I haven’t come across anyone as primitive as you since middle school."
anime,fh0tt59,t1_fh0s6e4,1581207512.0,Lol now I don’t feel so insecure compared to a homophobic piece of filth like you. Your just angry about your bland and worthless life so you feel the need to attempt to hurt others feelings. Thanks for making my day😇
anime,fgvecnz,t3_f0fdy1,1581146699.0,"Demon Slayer Kimetsu no Yaiba; Hands down best animation I’ve ever seen. Imagine Tokyo Ghoul but his sister is the ghoul(demon in this case) and were in ancient Japan. In some ways a stereotypical shonen but perfectly well balanced amount of troupes to where it has the good old shonen feel but without feeling recycled. Mostly fan-service free.                                    

Dr. Stone; totally unique premise. Protagonist is a science nerd who happens to be the last one around after the whole world has been turned to stone for 3700 years. Funnier than most anime and feels targeted towards a more intelligent audience. Mostly troupe-free since the protagonist isn’t a wannabe-badass shit for brain (don’t get me wrong I still find that archetype just as endearing as the rest of the anime community).                                                                                

Kaguya no Sama-Love is War; I generally find romantic comedy about as stupid and cringeworthy as the average male, but this one is definitely worth a try. It’s over the top portrayal of an awkward love confession stand off is downright hilarious and is literally treated like a mental fight scene.                                                                

These 3 are all fantastic anime that have made their debut in 2019, hope this helped!"
anime,fgvc31r,t3_f0jcxi,1581144046.0,"Sometimes I feel judged for loving anime,                                    It seems like the non-otaku population is divided between between people who don’t really know anything about anime, and people who judge it’s viewership.                                                                                        Some people label anime fans as degenerates, perverts, and cultural appropriators, which get lumped into the “weeb” label. So what if I watch anime on my spare time? It’s better than doing drugs or things that hurt people! So what if I think Japan is an awesome country, I’m learning Japanese language in college and have also learned sum Japanese history as well so I’m not “just thinking about Japan like a giant anime Disneyland”. Why do people have to judge what they don’t understand?"
Naruto,fd92joa,t3_ek6jel,1578227437.0,You deserve a few bowls of ramen for this one🥣
