bipolar,etihvz4,t1_ethgujc,1562850472.0,"Finally I find someone that does get anxiety/panic attacks with seroquel during the night. For me it also happens sometimes before I fall asleep, but also in the middle of thw night I wake up like that, because of a nightmare that I don't remember, or i dont know why.

I also take mirtazapine, used to take them together. Like 2-3weeks now. Im taking the seroquel a bit earlier, and then mirtazapine just before bed. Also I'm going to bed earlier lately, used to sleep at 3-4am, now 1-1:30. Maybe it's coincidence but they're not happening as often as they used to. But It still happens. Awful experience.

I hope you feel better soon ❤️"

bipolar,ervtzn8,t1_ersratz,1561324994.0,"I have done that like 3 times since I started! I was walking and talking no sense but in a funny way, my partner told me. Never happened to me before, so weird. I hope you're having a good day :)"
bipolar,ervtrre,t1_ert1z5e,1561324839.0,"It doesn't happen every night but maybe twice a week or so. I'm trying to take the Mirtazapine separately, just in case that works, so I would take the quetiapine like 1hour before bed and the mirtazapine right before closing my eyes.

I hopw I find a way, because Quetiapine is helping with depression after a lot of months.
Thanks and keep feeling better and better."
bipolar,ersywna,t1_erssv3o,1561227865.0,"For me it's like that too. I feel I can't breathe, dry mouth and throat, the moment I'm falling sleep again I wake up and have to stand because I cannot be laying in the bed, it's horrible.  

The first times I was also trying to wash my face, also tried lately to try and become awaker, because I feel like in a way my brain is asleep as I'm really groggy at the same time than anxious.
My partner tries to calm me down, which helps, im so lucky. But now immediately, even if i try all the above, the first thing I do it's to take a diazepam, they're only 2mg, it's not a crazy dose, but it helps after a little bit.

I don't know if it has to do with the way i take it, bcause I take it right before sleeping, because when i have taken it 1-2hs earlier, I would feel so dizzy and like nauseated than I wouldn't fall asleep. Anyway, I don't know...

Thank you and Sorry for the long reply. Very happy it's working out for you :)"
bipolar,ersy9k9,t1_erscyu4,1561227377.0,"I feel annoyed, because I know I have become better since started Quetiapine, so I would like to continue but I really wish I find the formula to take the night attacks out of the picture. Thank you :) all the best"
bipolar,ersy48m,t1_ers8rfh,1561227266.0,"I did have some horrible nightmares too, I think they're a bit kinder now, but really really vivid dreams/nightmares almost every day.  Of course I don't enjoy the nightmarea, but for me it's worse when I wake up in the middle of the night feeling panick and dry mouth and really freaking out of the blue.  I really hope you get some sweet dreams soon soon :)"
bipolar,ersxvr5,t1_erstzgr,1561227087.0,"I've been lucky I believe, my doctor has been opem to change and it's always offering options, I thibk the sertraline was a mistake and I took it for so long, but now it looks like we're going in the right direction, slowly but at least better than a month ago. Ty :)"
bipolar,ersxquv,t1_erspn44,1561226984.0,"I know, you're completely right.  In this case I do feel better since I started quetiapine but I do not enjoy these terrifying episodes.
 Ty :)"
bipolar,ersxlvp,t1_ers661o,1561226878.0,"In my case I was taking sertraline, and we changed that for quetiapine as my depression was not getting any better ( 7months long now) and besides the side effects I do feel better since the change. 

But the night panick attacks do really make me afraid to increase the dose.

Thank you for replying :)"
