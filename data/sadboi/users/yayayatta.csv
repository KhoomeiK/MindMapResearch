They’re natural body processes and you’re going to have to get used to it. Sure there are ways to prevent you from actually doing those things but saying you’d kill yourself is a bit extreme. You’d rather murder yourself if you’re not allowed to murder your own child. Doesn’t matter if they’re deformed or in a coma, a life is a life and it deserves to be protected.

I never said the value I morally place upon a child’s life wasn’t subjective, which is why I said we agreed to disagreed. You seem to place a higher moral value on sentient life (which in the future would make you think that AI is worth more than human life and people who are asleep are morally worthless) where I place human life above all other life. 

And it is life just as larva is a stage of development to a butterfly. An embryo is a stage of development in the life cycle of a human person. It has its own DNA and if given time to complete this stage of development they will grow into a fully grown productive member of society. Asleep or not, sorry forgot your exception to the clause, sentient or not, their life is worth intrinsically more than all other life, because they are human.

Laws are supposed to reflect society’s morality as a whole and laws change and the LGBT movement is proof of that.
