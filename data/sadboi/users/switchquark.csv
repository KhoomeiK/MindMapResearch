mcgill,fo7vcy9,t1_fo5irlz,1587585183.0,"I have a hard time believing this is the only reason, because most other Canadian universities don't do this, and they exist under capitalism just like McGill.
Also, McGill doesn't act in support of whatever's best for capitalism, McGill acts in whatever's best for McGill. So I wonder what does McGill get out of this system? What do professors get out of this system?

You would think that a university's dominant strategy would be to produce as many high-achieving alumni as possible, to get better donations and a better reputation, and logically that would include rewarding professors for being good at teaching. 

(Then again, I think it's totally possible that the reputation of a university has nothing to do with undergraduate students because UofT and McGill are both highly-ranked universities that imo suck balls at the undergraduate level.)"

-wake up before or after her so you don't have to eat breakfast with her (until things get better between you) 
-be polite to her as often as possible but don't feel obligated to spend a lot of time with her or have long  conversations with her 
-if you're in a remote/suburban area and it's legal, go on walks and play with your dog outside when your ankle is better 
-if she starts yelling don't say anything, don't yell back, it will make it worse. Just go hang out in your room or don't say anything. It sucks but she'll tire herself out and stop eventually. 
-wear your regular clothes, and shave your face or wear cologne or do other self care things to keep a routine and fend off depression"

asktransgender,fcvjbj2,t1_fcvf9gm,1578003308.0,"All good points. I still stand by everything else I said in the comment, but in retrospect I might have misinterpreted the article. 

Also, when writing that comment, I thought the criterion for gender identity disorder in children was the same as that for adults, that is, two of the following, 

A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics

A strong desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics

A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender

A strong desire to be of the other gender

A strong desire to be treated as the other gender

A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender



BUT it's actually six of the following,


A strong desire to be of the other gender or an insistence that one is the other gender

A strong preference for wearing clothes typical of the opposite gender

A strong preference for cross-gender roles in make-believe play or fantasy play

A strong preference for the toys, games or activities stereotypically used or engaged in by the other gender

A strong preference for playmates of the other gender

A strong rejection of toys, games and activities typical of one’s assigned gender

A strong dislike of one’s sexual anatomy

A strong desire for the physical sex characteristics that match one’s experienced gender

and I would imagine there are WAY more cis people with 6 of the GID criteria for children than 2 of the GID criteria for adults. Like, what the hell does the gender of your friends or the games you like to play have to do with your gender identity? Wild."
asktransgender,fcve39g,t3_ej368h,1578000174.0,"There have been zero documented cases of trans women attacking cis women and girls in public washrooms. Bathroom panic is a double whammy of denying trans women the right to exist in public and making trans AND cis women afraid to go outside and participate in public life, even when the CDC says that the majority of sexual violence happens in private homes and not in public places.


Most trans people will be able to pass at some point. You often can't tell what sex person a person was assigned at birth by looking at them. I was afab and I have been mistaken for a trans women dozens of times.

asktransgender,fcvc824,t1_fcv8ib0,1577999054.0,"Yeah you're right, to my knowledge (and I'm not a doctor or anything, just someone who likes to read) most studies say 65-95% of trans kids desist, but some experts think desistance is overstated. Especially cuz some people conflate kids who say ""I am scared of boy puberty, I want girl puberty"" with kids who say ""I like playing with mommy's make up"" and kids who say ""I want to be a boy so I can kiss girls."" Also, most studies have like 50 participants, so they should all be taken with a grain of salt. Still though, what a kid is like at age 3 says very little about what they'll be like as an adult."

asktransgender,fcv1qy8,t3_ej0bvl,1577992842.0,"Your child will probably not grow up to be transgender (most kids who say they're the opposite gender before age 16 grow up to be cisgender  https://www.kqed.org/futureofyou/441784/the-controversial-research-on-desistance-in-transgender-youth). 
There are also a lot of trans people who were very gender conforming as children (I don't have any statistical evidence for this, but this is the case for most trans people I know), so actions at age 3 are not a great predictor of who your child will be when she grows up. 
But it's great that you're being positive and seem open to the possibility. 
Thanks for your sensitivity and props to being supportive to your child. The world would be a happier place if more people were chill about the possibility that their child might grow up to be gender noncomforming or trans. Even if your child grows up to be cis, if you make it clear you would still love her and support her if she was trans, she'll know you'll love her and support her no matter what."
