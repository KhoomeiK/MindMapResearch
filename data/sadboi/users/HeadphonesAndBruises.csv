Also we aren't stupid but it's like playing a game with inverted controls for the first time against someone with a default setting. Don't dismiss someone just because they have a disorder.

Also never throw a person away or give them false hope. ""ALWAYS HERE FOR YOU"" etc are phrases we hear all the time and eventually turn into a bitter mantra to remind us that it is not true. Be there if you say it. 

If you are family then you do not get to decide that you did not sign up for a ""special"" child as we did not sign up for the disorder. Some of us have been hurt badly by this and if you have a ""special"" family member who doesn't seem to talk to others perhaps its because they know they are a burden to you or now are embarassed to see you as they have been burned or hurt.

We are more of a danger to ourselves. Its actually normies who harm, kill and abuse us more often. On the subject of ""us and them"", I feel like promoting mental illness as cool and trendy is incredibly dangerous but am happy to see it more in media portrayed at least reasonably more realistic.

Oh and if you are getting ghosted its mostly due to burning up too quick. Keep at it and show the connection is still there."
