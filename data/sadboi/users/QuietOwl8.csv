kdramarecommends,fqgalch,t1_fqg8d87,1589341602.0,"You can watch them in any order. If you want to watch them in the order they aired: 1997, 1994, & 1988, then you'll notice some easter eggs and stuff in the other dramas, but it's not necessary to watch them in the order they aired.

They're like regular dramas with a plot and it's not one where you can watch the episodes randomly and be able to follow."
kdramarecommends,fqg9x3g,t1_fqg7ut0,1589341164.0,"Yes, they have romance in them. :) I think Reply 1997 might be the one you should start with if you're looking for a good romance one. The other ones do focus on romance too, but 1997 is less love-triangle based and more straight to the point with who ends up with whom. They're all worth a watch though!

Since you wanted some details... spoiler marked them just in case others don't want to read these details.

>!Reply 1997 - The main guy has a crush on the girl, but the girl's feelings take quite a bit longer to catch up for him. Happy ending between them though. A bit of a love triangle in-between, but it's obvious who ends up with whom from almost the beginning.!<

>!Reply 1994 - More of a love triangle than 1997 in this one. Depending on who you ship really depends on whether you're happy with the ending romance.!<

>!Reply 1988 - The best of the Reply series, imo. But this one focuses less on the romance than the others. It DOES have romance though. It's just more slow and, again, depending on which guy you ship with the main girl might depend on how you feel about who she ends up with.!<"

AnxietyDepression,fjidcby,t3_fdby3v,1583365192.0,"Absolutely. I feel worse when thinking about those 10+ years I lost due to my depression and anxiety. I missed out on my entire 20's. A lot of things from that decade are a blur because I was basically a soulless body.  It sucks and I wish I could get those years back and press a big ""do over"" button, but I can't. And my thoughts love to bring me back to that place of ""you've wasted all that time and look where you are now. You're so behind. Look at everyone around you and see how behind you are and how you'll never measure up."" Those types of negative thoughts. 

But I have to fight back and say to those negative thoughts ""no, the past is the past. I can't change it, but I can move forward and that's what I'm going to try to do. Even if it's only a day at a time. Just move forward the best I can."" I know I can't keep dwelling on it or else I'm just going to continue to stay in the same place. So all we can do is the best we're able to in this moment, as hard as that is. It's so hard, I know, when you're in that hell of depression."

   * Avoid sweets and all that junk food stuff. **<-- Unless mashed potatoes and gravy are considered sweet stuff and white flat bread, then yes/no, I avoided/didn't avoid the junk food. Ate really late today because I slipped up around midnight last night during the time I was supposed to be fasting and ate 2 bananas. I was starving and couldn't hold back eating anymore this afternoon, so I gave in. Had small servings of cooked and seasoned green beans, lima beans, mashed potatoes + gravy, and red beans with rice. And then I ate a turkey sandwich and a half on white, flat bread. So I might have overdone it. Then hours later I had a medium plate of raw veggies (carrots, peppers, & broccoli) with some ranch dressing.**

KDRAMA,fcpsvrh,t3_ei5tjv,1577871414.0,"Oh my goodness, that’s quite a collection! I used to buy Kdrama’s on DVD, but my collection is not as massive as yours. I have the same copy of Goong that you do as well as some other YA Entertainment subtitled box sets. They really did have the best subtitles. Back when YA still sold the US versions, I managed to get Shining Inheritance, My Girlfriend is a Gumiho, Coffee Prince, My Lovely Kim Sam-Soon, 49 Days, City Hunter, My Girl, Sungkyunkwan Scandal, You’re Beautiful, and Goong.

I have some of the Singapore versions of various Kdrama’s as well and while they have good English Subtitles, it seems to be a hit or miss with the picture quality. Either the picture quality is lacking or part of the image is cut off (this happened with Arang and the Magistrate, Dream High, & Bridal Mask). Ones I bought that had good subtitles AND good picture quality were Queen Inhyun’s Man & The Princess’ Man.

Not sure why some came with bad picture quality while others were fine, but I also bought my dramas a long time ago, so they may not be like that anymore with the picture quality problems.

And the other Kdramas I own are packaged like the dramas on your 2nd from the bottom shelf. They all ended up having good picture quality and subtitles (Full House, Delightful Girl Choon Hyang, Flower Boy Ramen Shop, & Warrior Baek Dong Soo).

Kdrama DVD shopping could be a bit difficult. And it’s worse when trying to buy Jdramas with good subtitles. 😅"

mentalhealth,ezuk1zo,t3_d2eu1l,1568154032.0,"I’m sorry your mother and you and your brother are going through this. That sounds horrible. I have never had psychosis or anything that your mother seems to be going through at the moment, but I have had ECT before. 12 treatments in 2018. I had severe depression and no medications or hospitalizations or anything else was helping me improve. It got to the point where multiple doctors were recommending ECT. It seemed like the only thing left to try at that point.

I was terrified. Incredibly terrified, and I had to put my trust in these doctors that this was the right choice for me. I didn’t have much else to lose at that point though. I was getting nothing out of life and I’m pretty sure would have taken my own life at some point if I had not given ECT a try. It took several treatments before I started noticing any improvement and I did lose some of my memory. But the depression lifted SO much and I thought losing some memories wasn’t a big deal compared to having that type of depression lift. I would do the treatment again if I ever got to the point again where I needed to.

ECT does affect everyone differently though, and I’m sure no one can really expect how they will be affected. But it sounds like your mother has tried a lot of things at this point. If you trust these doctors and if there’s a chance it could really help your mother, it might be worth it. I would try to talk to the doctor doing the ECT treatments to get a better idea of things and what to expect overall.

It’s a risky treatment, but if nothing else is working it might be worth giving it a try for your mother. It sounds like she isn’t in the right position to make this decision herself. I know it’s a very scary and huge decision to make. And I wish you and your brother the best."
