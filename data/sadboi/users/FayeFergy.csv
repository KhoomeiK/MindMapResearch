You are anything but a ""defective retard"", from the snippet of your life you've shown here, you seem to be exceedingly intelligent, insightful, emotionally mature and sensitive. 

Personally, I think it sounds like you have a bad case of a narcissistic parent and more than likely a jealous sister who is repeating learned patterns from your mother. 

Is there any outside source you can reach out to for support/therapy/help with adhd? Even some online things during lockdown might benefit you.

Hang in there, I honestly believe you've got a lot to offer the world

**edit** just as a follow up- I can understand your reticence in wanting to out and out say you were abused, even though you give glaring examples of quite obvious abuse. Quite often, abusers make it so that it appears to be your fault they did that, or they will gaslight you and make you question if things really happened the way you thought they did. You start to believe that ""things weren't *so* bad, and you should be grateful, and really, it could have been worse..."". This is a CLASSIC tactic in abusers, and will lead you to repress a lot of anger about what's happened to you. No child, no person, deserves to be treated in the way you have been and you have every right to be angry, upset and hurt.

Following from that though, you have every right to be HEARD. I've repressed a lot of what happened to me as a child and I am in a very bad way many years later. As soon as you feel you are able, speak out. I know it's the hardest thing, but people will listen, I promise."
