My best advice would be ask the doctor anyways. I always asked unashamed and got different drugs/solutions to help me best. I have to say that I changed a lot of doctors, because I thought they were not helping me the best way they could. It took me some time to find my current doctor, so don’t be discouraged if doctors do not understand you at first.

Actually I got a prescription for Xanax for occasional use in the past. I used to have strong panic attacks and the only thing that would help was a high dose of it and staying in bed. It was the only way not to be taken to the ER every time.

I grew up in a very religious household and even studied in a religious school for some years of my life.

I usually buy lingerie based on my mood and feelings, i.e. am I looking for something sexy? Do I need a specific color or pattern to make a set? How much would I spend?


Second advice: explore (shops and online).

I really like go in-store to see the product, feel the fabric and check the quality by myself. I always try on (with my undies) the items I want to buy. It gives me the exact perception of the product based on my body and my likes. In the past, I saw a set on social media and I was totally hyped up. However when I tried it on, it was not flattering on me. 

Don’t forget to take your time to explore lingerie world online. There are tons of underground lingerie brands that are totally underrated or do not get enough coverage."
Aliexpress,fnie7tf,t3_g1gf83,1586978497.0,"I would discourage to order those items even though the price could be super attractive.
