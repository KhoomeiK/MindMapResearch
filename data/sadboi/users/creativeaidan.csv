Also, not enabling; just not making assumptions about whether or not a relationship is monogamous. Again, ""your partner can come talk about PREP if they want"" is just an open door, no judgement or assumptions about why. It also is a <1 minute conversation if there are no questions/immediate needs from the pt, and the info about PREP needn't be passed on if the pt feels it isn't applicable. 

As an example of where it *would* be useful, say your partner had other partners (and those relationships were all mutually consensual). You know your partner has no risk of getting infected by you, but you don't know their other partners' status, and don't inow if they know. You can tell your partner that clinic X have doctors that are versed in counseling patients about HIV risk and prescribing prep, and that they can go there to get tested and talk about their options."

(If yes) ""With men, women, or both?"" (I know this isn't very inclusive of non binary people but thats an issue for another post).

""What kind of protection do you and your partner(s) use?"" 

Esp when talking to people in the gay/bi male community this can reasonably lead to a question about PrEP, and the statement that they can get it here if they want it. For me, the main reason to say that is not because of your status, but because monogamy isn't a given and if there's any chance they're having sex with other people in a high risk population they should know about PrEP."

The real reason should be that we counsel everyone with sexual risk factors about PrEP because it's good epidemiology.

polyamory,exwrwq9,t3_cumb0p,1566624011.0,"I wish the author had taken the time to make their arguments more plain, and to explain it in language that would resonate outside of leftist circles. It honestly sounded like they were doubling down on communist rhetoric to sound smart, and to create an ""in group"" of readers who would nod along because they already use this parlance and framework in other spheres. Meanwhile, anyone who's not a leftist philosopher is left struggling to interact meaningfully with the text, since the reasoning for many of the arguments is not made plain. One particularly jarring thing for me is that the author never explains *why* our philosophy and actions as pertains to our personal relationships needs to also include the political philosophy of fighting for communism/fighting against the bougioise (sp?). (Side note, if you're going to talk about class struggle in the modern world - especially the US - language like ""the 1%"" or ""the billionaire class"" will resonate a lot more than antiquated language like bougioise). If their argument is that the same power structures that create private prisons and police abuse of force also perpetuate toxic relationship dynamics, they need to say that plainly. And explain why. And then explain why our personal relationships need to be oriented towards cultural/political revolution. I'd love to engage with these ideas, but if that's what the author meant they left it as subtext for a ""woke"" audience.

Also, nothing says RA as a relationship philosophy can't result in the formation of communal structures. If that's the kind of dynamic that those involved need and agree to there's no contradiction there. Further, I think that there needs to be some middle ground (probably unique to each situation) between ""you are the only person responsible for finding people to fill your needs"" and "" we share a responsibility to create communal structures that recognize that most people's needs are filled by communities"". The circle of friends and relationships you build should be one that is supportive to everyone who enters it in good faith...but not every community can be everything for everyone and if you need something you're not getting, well, ultimately you are the best person to a) articulate that, and then b) go seek it out (with the support of your community, if that's important to you)."
polyamory,exvhj7g,t1_exvf3n2,1566599889.0,"Ok, I see where you're coming from. I agree, not nearly enough people actually discuss desires for monogamy vs polyamory and instead just assume the default. I think in general people who are in minority type relationships (same sex or poly) have a lot to teach to mono/het couples about how to negotiate things that most of society takes for granted."
polyamory,extffvk,t1_exsuggl,1566567884.0,"Not the person you were replying to, but I think in the first part they meant that if you *did* explicitly enter a monogamous relationship you have a right to expect monogamy unless stated otherwise. This is debatable on the point of what is or isn't a ""right"", but just saying ""if we agreed on monogamy I expect monogamy"" shouldn't be problematic. 

Secondly, you're essentially trying to argue that everyone should just be totally okay with a partner wanting to open a previously closed relationship and that if you have any negative emotions about that at all you're a bad person. It is absolutely normal and ok for the partner who wants to remain monogamous to feel upset. It's ok for them to not be okay with entering into an open relationship. And this can all be healthy:

A: Hi, B, I have been thinking, and I want to explore non-monogamy for xyz reasons.

B: Wow, I...I don't know if I could do that. That idea makes me feel upset and anxious, and I don't think I would enjoy a relationship where we're not exclusive.

[A and B talk more about why they feel their respective ways]. 

B: Okay, I understand why you want this, and i support you, but it's just not for me. I understand this is hard, and we both may need some time apart, but could we still be friends?

In the above scenario, A gets to express why they want to be non-monogamous, B has the space to air their emotions about the issue, and in the end they respect each other's position but decide that they can't be romantic/sexual partners. No one is trying to control the other person, but they can both honestly say what's on their mind, even if it's a difficult and/or negative emotion about the subject. 

(By the way it should work the same way for sex. Person A wants to stop a sex act, Person B is able to healthily express how they feel about that: ""I do feel a bit disappointed because I wanted to do [sex act], but I respect you and your boundaries. Would you like to do [intimate but non-sexual act] instead?"")"

pics,ex3bu0d,t1_ex2z1th,1565983141.0,"I understand what you're saying and I still disagree (might just be a matter of terminology though). ""Stigma"" generally referrs to moral judgement passed against a person because if their actions (I.e. ""you are a bad person because you did a bad thing."") It also usually refers to judgements passed wrongfully. (For example, it would sound weird to say that being a Nazi is stigmatized because most people think that passing moral judgements against Nazis is an appropriate response). So saying that we should work to remove the stigma around addiction is saying we should work to stop moral judgements being made against people who are addicts *just because they are addicts*. This does not mean we absolve them of all responsibility - a part of AA's 12 steps is making ammends for the wrong you have done as part of your addiction. It just means we don't shame them for their drug use.

Further, I'd argue about your assertion that drug use is always morally bad (I assume this is what you mean by bad. I'd agree most drugs are physically bad for you). There's a lot of history behind *which* drugs are 'bad', and in what context, and for whom. Is smoking morally bad? Is drinking? Using marijuana? Cocaine? Heroin? Where is the line drawn and by whom and why? Many of the laws we have surrounding drugs come from racist political agendas, forcing marginalized communities to bear the brunt of the addiction crisis, and thereby bearing the brunt of the stigma. Certainly, drug use can result in you *doing bad things*, and again, a part of recovery is atoning for that, but its harder to argue that use in and of itself is morally bad."

This is not an exceptional case, this is a *major reason* why so many people are hooked on opioids.

Also, drug addiction is highly correlated with certain genotypes, as well as poor childhood experiences (things you associate with mental illness). 

The medical community recognizes addiction (substance use disorder) as a mental illness."
pics,ex26n1m,t1_ex25kbs,1565963757.0,"1) Addiction, aka Substance Use Disorder, is an official diagnosis in the DSM 5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, aka the big book of *mental illness diagnoses*). This is because it is verifiably a psychiatric condition which shares similar social, personal, and neurobiological causes to other mental illnesses, and in fact such illnesses frequently co-occur. 

1a) As an example, eating disorders (another mental illess) share many similarities with addiction, including an out of control pattern of behavior, often stemming from a need to control some aspect of one's life or deal with external situations over which the person has no control.

2) People who get addicted to opioids after being prescribed opioid medications (sometimes wrongfully) have done nothing wrong except see a doctor and have a combination of genetic, neurologic, and social factors that predispose them to opioid addiction.

3) There are studies showing definitive neurobiological changes in the brains of addicts, and genetic studies showing genes linked to predisposition to addiction (might link them later, on mobile right now). I.e., there is a partly physical basis for this disease. 

5) The treatment for addiction is medical and psychotherapeutic in nature, the same as other mental illnesses.

4) Regardless, shaming someone for an addiction does nothing to help, and drives them away from care, whereas showing compassion relieves some of the shame that prevents them from seeking care. Even if the above weren't true, I'd rather use the language that gets people to treatment."
pics,ex24gc3,t1_ex1nmsh,1565962549.0,"I disagree. The stigma around addiction, as with the stigma around any other mental illness, results in people being scared and less likely to reach out and get the help that they need to start their recovery. Destigmatizing addiction, treating it like the disease it is (and not a moral failing) will help people who find themselves trapped in a spiral that they can't control.

Packers can help some people with ""down there"" dysphoria, because some look very realistic and can make it look like you have a masculine bulge in your pants. 

These things might help alleviate your dysphoria and give you back some confidence and love for your body, but neither they nor testosterone are cure-alls.

Ficiverse,evqwa01,t3_ckotic,1564698247.0,"Couple points:

1) 5 trans people will have 6 different opinions on this idea. That doesn't mean you should discount any one person's opinion, but at the end of the day wjat matters is that whatever you do you do it with research and tact.

2) Speaking as a nonbinary person this idea actually sounds kind of fascinating, if you handle it well. Some pitfalls you couls fall into are a) generally insinuating that trans people should ""learn to be comfortable"" with their gender assigned at birth, as you have stated is the arc for your character, b) passing value judgements on femininity/masculinity (I.e. being a woman/man is better because...), c) diminishing the struggle trans people go through to transition (by way of magicking your character back to the ""right"" gender), d) hamming up stereotypes about men trying to ""act like"" women, which can reflect poorly on trans women. This is not an exhaustive list.

3) HOWEVER, if you write this very well you could come out with an interesting story on how people and societies approach gender, the sexism this character might experience simply based on their new appearance (despite literally everything else being the same), and perhaps a motto not of ""accepting one's femininity/feminine side"" but of going beyond sex/gender and accepting one's worth and value as a person regardless of biology. Basically it could be an interesting ""the gender binary is fake and I am fundamentally the same person regardless of how i present or what my anatomy looks like"". 

4) Someone will always be offended, BUT there's a difference between doing your research and writing horrible caricatures. If you do this, please do the former. Talk to a lot of trans and nonbinary folks. Happy writing!"

But I also knew I was miserable with my ED. So my therapist told me to fake it. You don't have to believe that your body looks good, but say at least one good thing to yourself about your appearance every day anyway. You don't need to want dessert, but it's part of your meal plan so find the most palatable option. Honestly, everyone is faking it, to some extent. Until maybe, while you're not looking, a part of you starts to believe that your body is lovable at any size. A part of you is maybe looking forward to that ice cream. A part of you is going about their life without using the ED as a crutch every step of the way. In the end, it's all habit. Your ED is a strong habit. Self love and healthy eating is just another habit that you have to work towards, overcoming your previous ones.

2) For all that work to be possible, you have to find reasons to do it. They don't have to be big reasons, or reasons that make sense to anyone else at all. Find something in the next day, or the next week, that you're looking forward to. That you want to be there for, both physically and mentally. Going to see a movie next Friday? That's why you stay alive this week, that's why you try to follow your meal plan and work to break the mental habits your ED has gotten you into. It's a good movie and you want to be able to go and pay attention. I used to get really panicked about having to do the work of recovery and eating enough *for the rest of my life*, and that sent me spiraling. So don't think about forever. Focus on a chunk of time you can manage. You can do the work from now til Friday. And on Friday you can figure out the next thing you're aiming for. 

3) Celebrate little things. Like, really little things. Had dessert today? Even if it was a tiny bit and you hated it? Pat yourself on the back! Good job! That's something you couldn't do yesterday. Were you able to go a day without purging? Congratulate yourself, that is a hell of an accomplishment. You're going to feel like shit if you tell yourself that you can't celebrate your progress until you're recovered. Every step is good. Every step is worth celebrating, even if it was tiny and you kicked and screamed the whole damn time.

4) You're going to feel like shit...and that's allowed. Recovery is a shit ton of work to battle against the habits and voices in your head that are SCREAMING at you for even trying. You are going to have bad days. You are going to have days where all you can do is lay down and cry. You are going to have days where it doesn't seem worth it, and giving up looks easier. You are going to backslide. This is all okay. It is okay to be there, in that dark black hole where nothing looks like it will ever be okay again. It's okay to stay there a while, if you have to. It's okay to let people see you're struggling, too. This whole recovery business is a war, it would be disingenuous to say that there won't be pain and tears. You are allowed to not be okay. It doesn't make you a bad person, it doesn't make you bad at recovery, it doesn't mean you don't deserve life and happiness. You're allowed to not be okay.

5) Reach out. For me, one of the biggest factors that contributed to my ED was isolation. Finding activities I enjoyed doing with people I enjoyed being around helped break the cycle of ED-related thoughts and obsessions. You don't even need to talk about what you're going through with these people. Just being with other people who can pull you out of your own head and take your mind off of the thoughts for a while is so helpful. Literally, make yourself too preoccupied with spending time with people, doing things you enjoy to think about your next meal, or the fact that you want to purge but you can't, or what your body looks like. Alone, your brain is an echo chamber, amplifying all those thoughts. Fill it with something else to pay attention to for a while. 

I hope some of this is helpful, and please feel free to reach out if you want to talk."

NonBinary,eotcuql,t1_eos6lgr,1558838930.0,"Not OP, but I fall in the same boat. A lot of it is that I am aware of the implication the word transgender has to people who are not very familiar with LGBTQ+ issues. To them it means male to female or female to male, and I'd much rather say precisely what I mean the first time around and answer questions about being non binary than *know* that I am going to be misunderstood at first and then have to explain not only that enbies exist but that the word trans doesn't mean what you thought it does. 

And yes, I know that the public perception of the word transgender won't change unless more enbies openly adopt it but I'm not in a place where I can carry that banner."

EatingDisorders,eofazp1,t3_brmn08,1558529206.0,"Cross country/track was the environment in which I developed my eating disorder, so this is an issue near to my heart. It's unfortunately horrifically common in the sport, given the emphasis on speed and thinness. The extent to which you help I guess depends on how open you are about your struggle and how comfortable you are in talking with the other girls who are suffering from the same thing.

The first thing that came to mind is very subtle, but if you have team dinners the night before a meet, model taking an appropriate portion of food (Which, for an athlete would mean pretty much filling your plate with complex carbs and protein--not just salad). Similarly, model bringing healthy and fuel dense snacks to the meet, and eat them on the bus on the way there/after the race where your teammates can see and get the hint that it's healthy and normal to fuel your body. Also, since the exercise itself can be a compulsive part of anorexia, model taking days off. For example, after a race you can say something about having earned a relaxing day off the next day (assuming your races are on Saturdays and so you would naturally not have organized practice on Sunday). On a non-race weekend, just drop comments on the Friday after practice about how you're looking forward to giving your body time to rest on Saturday or Sunday. If you have the means/space, offer to invite your teammates (maybe specifically invite the 4 other girls) to your house on your ""off day"" for healthy snacks and getting school work done.

It should go without saying, but model *not* doing harmful behaviors as well: no body shaming yourself/fat talk in the locker room or anywhere else, no body checking in the locker room, no weights/numbers, no ""ugh I ate *so much*, I feel fat,"" etc.

Moving to more direct ways of helping, if you're not close to your struggling teammates already, try to cultivate some kind of a friendship/mentorship (if they're younger). Even if it's not directly related to their/your ED, make it clear through your words and actions that you are there to listen to whatever they have to say. Check in with them before practice, ask them how their days were, let them know you're available if they want to talk more/in private. If you are in a more confidential conversation with one of them, and you feel comfortable doing so, disclose some things you are going through re: recovery. Silence hurts people with EDs, and our society has stigmatized us into silence and shame. Something like ""man, it can be hard to follow the meal plan my dietician gave me, but it's worth it because it helps me have energy for practice."" (Thats really corny but you get the idea). 

Finally, my XC and track teams used to have pre-season team meetings. This is more relevant for next year's XC season, but if you're feeling quite bold you could ask your coach if you could say something at the meeting, and maybe work with them/with your therapist if you have one to draft something to say to the whole team about what you've been through, the pressures of the sport, how you've progressed in recovery, etc. and sort of more publicly offer yourself as someone anyone on the team can go to for support.

Hope this helped; feel free to PM me if you have any questions/want to talk."
transgender,eoedyc9,t3_brfs0r,1558494077.0,"To respond to a lot of the people who don't want to be lumped in with cis women and brought into the abortion conversation: the way I see it is that this is a push to make room for trans men in the discussion, as another group that *can* experience pregnancy and abortion (and childbirth!) and who have a right to share their stories about such things if they choose. And if that's not a conversation you want to be a part of, or it's not relevant to your life, that's also equally valid and you can carry on. The point is making it more acceptable and possible for trans men who do want to share their experiences with abortion to come forward, as a separate group that is being similarly impacted by restrictions on reproductive rights."
