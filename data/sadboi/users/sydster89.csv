Again, I am sorry my answer has upset you. I’m not sure you’re understanding that that’s actually not at all what I would have said to this potential client. I would not be blaming on their dog. I would be blaming it on MY dogs. As this doesn’t affect either of us in any way, I am happy to agree that both styles are perfectly valid. I was simply saying what I have found works for me. Thank you again for your input."
RoverPetSitting,f5xwbs4,t1_f5xw6pq,1572547209.0,"I think we must be saying the same thing then! Just in a different style like I said. I’m not sure why you’re so against my answer, but I will take to heart what you have said and I respect it."
RoverPetSitting,f5xufhz,t1_f5xset9,1572546406.0,"What a great community we have here! The OP got several great answers and can choose or borrow from any of them that they feel comfortable with. That’s simply the one I would go with since it would be about my dogs, not theirs, therefore if they come back at me with the “my dog is different because” I can fall right back to the same answer, that my dogs don’t do well in that situation and that’s the reason it’s not a good fit. I have found over the last 13 years that a slightly more detailed answer rather than a vague shut down works better for me because I am still recommended by the person I turned down to others. At many a meet and greet I have heard complaints about how rude sitters are when they turn down potential clients “for no reason.” I don’t think that the other answer is rude of course but people are extremely sensitive about their babies and get offended very easily. Thanks so much for your input, I am so glad to have this place to listen to other sitters and converse and see all the different styles and the thought processes and experiences behind them."

In the end this is about safety first, your liability second, and both of those things are a very big deal.

Kind of framing it as your dogs “fault” should take some of the pressure off. Good luck!"

Only thing I can think of is the Cactus Jack guy who made a deal with Barbara, she later said it was the worst business deal she ever made.

It’s totally ok to stop. It’s also ok to go back someday when you’re ready. I feel like you’re being unnecessarily hard on yourself here. He shouldn’t take it personally at all and it’s completely your choice to decide. 

I think the advice to just talk through issues that is usually given has more to do with someone who still wants to be in therapy but just has a small issue with their therapist. This isn’t that, you sound like you’re self aware and intelligent. You’re simply saying that maybe you aren’t ready yet for another therapist/client relationship which is a perfectly valid reason to quit or take a break. 

Best of luck my friend! You got this!"

Don’t get me wrong, I love watching new stuff too:) I get so upset when a favorite show comes to an end. I’ve been known to watch everything except the last 20 minutes of the last episode because as long as I don’t watch it, I still have it. When I finally do watch it I get so sad when it’s over.

Sometimes when you’ve been sitting for someone regularly for years it slips your mind more to update (and they don’t really notice either since there is trust there at that point), but when you have a new client it’s extremely important to update them soon and regularly.

What if he skips out and goes to a friends house after school and doesn’t tell anyone? What if he leaves a door open and the pets run out? What if he decides to throw a party? That last one actually happened to me one time, nephew had a key and knew aunt and uncle were out of town. They didn’t know I was spending the night and threw a party in the basement. It was horrible. That’s also why I always asked from them on at meet and greets if they’re expecting anyone else to be at the house. Personally I would never ever take care of someone’s child, but, if you’re comfortable with it then more power to you! Just ask for more money and for a plan if something goes wrong.

Edit: aunt and uncle knew I was spending the night as they hired me to do so. Nephew and friends didn’t know"
