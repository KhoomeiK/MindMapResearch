Cars thing to fast, movies freaking me out, past memories coming back. I used to remember a swing from when I was a kid that freak me out big time. Whenever I thought of it I got super anxious, it was a heavy wooden swing that can fit 3 people and it was held by two thing rusty chains and I only imagined people swinging on it hard and it breaking and a bunch of legs getting trapped under it. Typing that gave me a shudder ugh.

But it gets better. I'm not having anxiety attacks anymore and I'm becoming more social. I'm finally able to sleep again which is great! But I'm also trying to come to terms with the things I've done as a drunk dipshit. It's hard man but time heals everything."

The only thing I could do is replace the hard drive and the ram. Everything else is soldered to the board for sure.

Hmmm try one more fresh install because from my experience people mess up their computers, not the hardware failing. (Source: I'm the best buy computer guy, only one in my department that actually builds computers).

So if a fresh install does not work I would consider looking into hardware failure. Since it's refurbished what usually happens is they do a quick test not involving benchmarks or stress tests and then put the computer back out. I think legally they even need to put in new hard drives which they don't do. They just wipe the drive and assume people can't recover data.
