I know that some antinatalist are hardcore and will see my comment as extremely natalistic and see me of deserving a slow and excruciating death. To inform you, I am an almost absolute negative utilitarian and an efilist at the same time, which means I  believe that suffering is one of the most horrific things that happened in the universe and must be reduced to the lowest point and I believe that every sentient consciousness must be put into eternal extinction so that they will never have the potential to cause themselves suffering or to others. Antinatalism is indeed a valid sentiocentric position and it would be very nice if no human will ever breed again so that these new beings will not suffer. But the problem when all human dies is that we will lose the opportunity to stop the suffering among all the sentient beings on earth and the entire cosmos.

I followed a similar path to yours, but my starting point was a bit different. My family is moderately religious, but I personally made myself into a fundamentalist christian (interpreting the bible literally) and attempted to follow the holy rules as much as possible. But back then, I never really liked God, nor loved him; I never understood how this God came to be and why he created anything. But there is one thing why I fear God so much, its because the God of the bible created hell, the most torturous and tormenting place ever created in the universe, reserved to sinners who turned away from God. That was my primary reason why I kept on trying to be holy so that I won't end up there.   


But alas, its practically impossible not to constantly sin in this fast-paced, consumerism era. I had hurted a lot of people in the past and did not asked for their forgiveness. I had succumbed to my materialistic desire and end up stealing from others and watching a ton of adult contents. Soon after I realized that my weight of sins cannot be forgiven, I believed I was going to hell. This caused a tremendous impact to my psychological well-being, and I fallen to despair. 

Suddenly, I got interested in philosophy somehow, then end up reading a lot of it, then I slowly began to realize that the bible may not be an infallible words of God , but a possible fiction. Then I stopped being a christian and became a nihilist for a while, until I stumbled in r/antinatalism, and then here after I read some ethical philosophies.

Instead, societies should heavily invest in technological sciences working on life extension and transhumanization technology so we don't need to procreate and suffer anymore.

Efilism,fpnzprx,t1_fpnw3gk,1588775744.0,"Absolutely, this universe is a shithole for creating the mechanism of suffering among sentient consciousness capable of experiencing it.   


All we can do is cope, reduce suffering to yourself and others and try to spread the philosophy of efilism as much as possible. But it is all up to you whether you wish to do your best in doing the right thing or not."

antinatalism,fpkx4xk,t1_fpkqpv0,1588702562.0,I guess we have to agree to disagree in this part. Our moral viewpoint does not appear to meet although we agree on a particular concept for similar reasons.
antinatalism,fpkocji,t1_fpkk497,1588698215.0,"You have an interesting take about consensual re-population. But for what reasons are for the purpose re-populating? If seen in a perspective of negative-utilitarianist, cloning creates more beings and being immortalization makes it more difficult to terminate that being's suffering and also can be subjected to long-term torture without the termination of that being, which causes more suffering to the being itself and to others, as they have the potential to infinitely perpetuate suffering as the being's life can't be terminated. All in all, it increases aggregate net suffering in this universe and it is immoral to do so without good reason. 

But if its for the sake of ensuring the extinction of all other species while sustaining a being in maintaining that state of universe, then it could be morally a good thing."
Efilism,fpkks2u,t1_fpkis0f,1588696447.0,"Some would even question the truth of Efilism itself as certain radical nihilists are extremely absurd and sensitive to something that has the word ""truth"". Smh."
nihilism,fpkiy78,t3_gdv45g,1588695524.0,"But there is suffering experienced by sentient beings in this universe.Unbearable, excruciating, agonizing, tormenting, unspeakable suffering exists and someone, something out there, is experiencing it.

Whether life has meaning, purpose, value or objective truth is up to the individual, but the suffering that others, and you, are experiencing will always be the biggest problem of the universe. Whether you hate or love life is up to you, but we will act regardless in whatever gives us pleasure and what avoids pain, as we are enslaved to our own biological mechanism of survival and reproduction. The cycle of consumption, survival and reproduction, will always exist in this universe, regardless if its stopped or not.  


I don't intend to advocate any violence here, but I wish for this universe to be destroyed and for all sentient beings to be put into eternal extinction. That way, suffering will forever be no more."
Efilism,fpkdr8l,t1_fpkd1oi,1588692829.0,"Uhm, I didn't created the universe. I didn't even asked to have a desire for universalized extinction prior to being born. I was merely being rationally reasonable in addressing the issue of suffering without using concepts of certain questionable philosophies (Solipsism much?)"
Efilism,fpkcc4l,t1_fpk1kf1,1588692085.0,"I agree with the fact that desire is indeed, one of the causes of human suffering (as well as sentient beings with their biological need). That doesn't change the fact that sentient species (capable of experiencing suffering) can also experience suffering from something against their own will (ex. Torture, either from others or your very own body) and that is unjustifiable and warrants universal extinction of all species.

Your statement seems to reflect closely to one of the fundamental tenet of Buddhism. Although the philosophical practice itself has some truths regarding about human suffering derived from human desire, it fails to address the issue of suffering for the rest of other sentient beings and of other sources of suffering."
nihilism,fpju5de,t1_fpjo5b7,1588681067.0,"I absolutely agree with you. I have no idea how did that dude thought of pain and happiness as an interdependent dichotomy when they can be independent to each other.
