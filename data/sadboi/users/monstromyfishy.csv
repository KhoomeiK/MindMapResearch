My sister was on the brink of suicide and one day, while crying a lot, she finally got the courage to tell my parents that she didn’t want to continue going to college. She was about to start her fourth year after transferring and she felt so much pressure since her older siblings had gone to grad school. She spent all this time terrified of how my parents would react but instead my parents supported her and helped her get the help that she needed. My parents surprisingly encouraged her to quit, to try something new and we’re very supportive through the whole thing. She still struggles with depression but we’re happy that she is no longer suicidal and that she is taking the time to explore what she wants to do. Best of luck to you."

DentalSchool,foph2dt,t3_g8tb3p,1587961302.0,"Hello. I just wanted to respond as a brown lady who has successfully become a dentist and works in the real world. I wouldn’t let that stop you. The reality is that racism and prejudice will be something that you will struggle with for the rest of your life. It shouldn’t stop you from going after your dreams. If you are concerned, I would ask the dental schools that you interview with about how they would handle a situation where you are being discriminated against, whether it is from a patient or a classmate. I know that my school had a zero tolerance policy and would dismiss a patient if they ever made you feel uncomfortable in any way. It’s also something you can ask about when you interview for future work. But I would like to say that we need more people of color in dentistry! People of color need dentists too and most communities of color would prefer to be treated by a dentist who comes from their own background. And we can’t change the face of dentistry if people of color continue to feel like it is not a profession they can participate in. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions or want to discuss a little further. Happy to help in any way I can! Best of luck to you in your future endeavors."

When I feel bored or stuck or in a rut, I imagine the next phase of our relationship. I remind myself that I’m only bored temporarily. Then I envision my boyfriend as a father and I know I want him to raise our future children together. I imagine us old as grandparents and him trying to understand whatever game the young kids will be playing in 40 years. I think about the places I want to travel to and imagine him by my side making the adventure so much fun. I just think ahead about our next big life stepping stones and then I’m reminded that there is no one in the world I’d like to spend my whole life with other than him. And with those visualizations, the feeling goes away. I keep in mind that those feelings are temporary and that every couple feels the same after so much time.

I eat out when I please. I’m comfortable and I don’t stress about money even with my loans over my head. I’m looking forward to pay raises the longer I do this.

DentalSchool,fjgoktm,t3_fd5s8j,1583332058.0,"For me, having a study group was the most helpful thing. We would study quietly by ourselves and then when we came across something that we missed in lecture or didn’t understand, someone else usually had the recording or the diagram or better notes. We’d also pop quiz each other when we came across small details that someone else might have overlooked. It combines individual study methods to get you where you need to be. Some of the creative people in our group came up with pneumonic devices or diagrams which were shared among the group which helped a lot. Of course you have to choose your study group wisely because it can quickly become friends hanging out. For me, having a study group helped me fill in the gaps in my notes and in my knowledge. But I know this doesn’t work for everyone. I will say we had at least one guy who was on the verge of failing out 1st year join our study group and successfully got him through all the didactic courses. Good luck!

We all have our days though and I hope I’ve helped you live one more day, but I expect you’ll be under even more scrutiny tomorrow so watch out! Hope you do feel better irl though!"

hogwartswerewolvesA,esqja88,t1_esq6zt2,1562203616.0,"# Do Not Vote for DaddyKaddy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Hello y'all! So, I've gone over everything and here is my 2 cents. First, I am against voting for u/DaddyKaddy because it is entirely possible that they are silenced! We have a silencing role I believe and it is just plain rude to lynch people without giving them the chance to defend themselves. Let us remember that the flavor text states that The Rock was attacked. The rules say that when The Rock is attacked, they cannot participate in discussion the next day. In addition, anyone who visits the Grim Reaper's victims can also be silenced. **By killing DaddyKaddy, we may be killing one of our own town roles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**! Second, I am against voting for u/StockParfait because I firmly believe we need to give newbies the benefit of the doubt and give them the chance to enjoy the game. We're a more welcoming community than that! With that said, I am leaving my vote on u/whichwitch007 for now, but I'm willing to change my vote to u/Forthwrite95 if I notice that consensus is leaning that way. I'll check back in in about 6 hours before I go to bed to change my vote as necessary. But, just to be clear, I will not vote DaddyKaddy or StockParfait unless they make a scumslip or something dramatic in the next few hours. It goes against my moral compass.

werebot, go! 

On a totally unrelated note, my interview went really well and I charmed the pants off my interviewers so fingers crossed I get the job. I'm going to go celebrate now."
hogwartswerewolvesA,esqgh17,t1_esq6nkl,1562202007.0,"Wait, I thought it was HWW tradition to kill people on their birthday? LOL."
hogwartswerewolvesA,esokfo2,t1_esohbb8,1562169341.0,"Sorry. I will preface this with: I have always been wrong. I have yet to catch a wolf and most of the time my hunches are wrong. So this is just me leaving my thoughts and if we would like to go in another direction, I'll drop it. But I do want to clarify:  I don't think RPM's analysis holds much weight, but I do think it is valuable input. I'm asking the question: why would the wolves kill Nanner? I think they were hoping to frame RPM, but didn't anticipate that RPM would die today. But, I suppose I am reaching. Like I said, I've never been right."
hogwartswerewolvesA,esofst8,t3_c8jv7c,1562166694.0,"Good morning everyone. I was just planning on checking in for the day, but after reading the flavor text, my tinfoil hat started to heat up and I thought let me share my ideas with the town and give my mind a break from my interview. So Nanner caught my attention yesterday when she replied to my comment about how I was still bitter with RPM ([interaction here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hogwartswerewolvesA/comments/c85dhq/phase_1_everybody_is_here/eslehft?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)). In retrospect, I think Nanner was potentially signaling that they were a neutral role in trying to ""make a pact"" with me. After all, we don't know her win condition. And she seemed to be antagonizing him a little further [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hogwartswerewolvesA/comments/c85dhq/phase_1_everybody_is_here/esmatc5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). So I'm thinking the Nanner kill was meant to be a frame job, but they didn't anticipate that RPM would also be eliminated this phase. Which leads me to look into the other interactions that RPM had. RPM called out u/whichwitch007 yesterday in this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hogwartswerewolvesA/comments/c85dhq/phase_1_everybody_is_here/esmwobw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)! So in conclusion, I'm placing my placeholder on whichwitch unless something better comes up."

AnxietyDepression,es8ggd5,t3_c6ejvd,1561697056.0,"Hello. My feelings were pretty similar to yours when I started counseling. I would make the appointment 2 weeks ahead of time and by the following week, I would convince myself that nothing was wrong and I was my normal self and would cancel the appointment. I did this around 3 times when my boyfriend finally pointed out that it was as a repetitive cycle and asked that I go even if I was feeling okay when the appointment came around. I went my last year of college to the schools counseling center and it was helpful. It felt good to have someone validate my feelings. My counselor was very willing to work with me and listened when I told her that I wanted to avoid medications. I’ve been on and off counseling for the past 10 years and I only go when I need it. Hope that helps! Good luck."

Anxiety,erpuiab,t3_c33pv0,1561128320.0,"Hello there. I’ve got anxiety and depression and I’ve been with my boyfriend 10 years. One thing that helped us was that one day after years of my conditions causing problems, I sat him down and told him I wanted him to understand. And for 5 minutes I said out loud the unfiltered anxious thoughts that go through my mind. I ended by telling him that this anxiety occurs periodically and it is almost never really his fault. He was surprised at first but after a few discussions, he understood. But most importantly he asked what he could to help when I’m feeling anxious. And we’ve gone through lots of trial and error but we’ve finally got something that works for us. Hope that’s helpful!"
