SuicideWatch,f5t2rvd,t3_dkfkaq,1572449144.0,"I have the same feeling.

I thought I'll eventually find my purpose in life. But now, I realize I would just go through life obeying orders just to make ends meet, distracting myself from the soul-crushing reality with media and fiction. And I'll die in my room alone from some illness, whether it'd be age related or not, decomposing before anyone finds me one week later when my flesh is eaten by maggots. Just like those stories of people dying alone in their apartments.

What's the point? Might as well go out with a bang."

Isekai,f50btfq,t1_f4z6u2d,1571924966.0,">It seems so idealistic in manga but interpersonal relationships in manga are so shallow and unrealistic. I thought about this some too bc I read craploads of isekais.

It is bad writing to have shallow relationships in fiction, but in real life, you might prefer it due to its simple honest and uncomplicated purity."
Isekai,f4xkze4,t1_f4x9pz3,1571866525.0,"I dunno. I feel like I'm going to die from suicide sooner or later.

That, or dying from some kind of illness. Funny how I was at my prime physically at high school. Almost died as a baby and now into my twenties, more and more chronic illnesses seem to pop out of nowhere."
