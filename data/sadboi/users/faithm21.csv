disneymagickingdoms,fqz7bsm,t1_fqyieoe,1589761388.0,This game takes a lot of patience unless you’re willing to drop lots of cash 😂if you stick with it you’ll eventually get those characters and attractions!
disneymagickingdoms,fqxpwfb,t3_glic0w,1589736060.0,I just got her and I haven’t gotten dumbo yet. I was able to level her up already
disneymagickingdoms,fqxoaet,t3_gldkm9,1589735378.0,This is so cool! Pocahontas will be my first comfy costume. You’re so lucky you have that many 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fqvufjt,t1_fqvs87i,1589685429.0,You can do it! And yes there’s lots of different leaderboards. Even for the three separate parts you will have different people in them !
disneymagickingdoms,fqtyxpp,t1_fqtuumk,1589648785.0,"I have been collecting the cage birds every 8 hours and when I didn’t have enough bags or strings I just bought them in merlins shop so I could keep sending them out! Also, I set timers so I wouldn’t wait to long to collect 😊"
BackYardChickens,fqoqvwq,t3_gjy2sl,1589522229.0,"Aw I did the same exact thing. Bought 4 chicks, went to the store, saw a polish, and got 2 more. Then I went to the store again and saw gray silkies and got 3 more ! Went from 4 to 9 real fast 😂☺️"
chickens,fqnse7v,t1_fqnr793,1589500515.0,You’ll get those silkies soon! I ended up finding them at my local tractor supply and they were all mixed up with the other bantams. I bought 2 other chicks and 2 silkies and one of my silkies passed the first day. 😢I’m glad I still have the one silkie though!
chickens,fqnrux1,t1_fqnmvq5,1589500229.0,Aw thanks! Her back looks so funny already. She’s going to look so crazy but she’s still adorable ☺️
chickens,fqnl5m3,t1_fqnkott,1589496829.0,My other chicks all got out of their awkward stages about a month in. She’ll be in it for awhile I guess but I can’t wait to see her with her adult floof 😄
chickens,fqnkyab,t1_fqnknry,1589496723.0,Just one on each foot
chickens,fqnkkvp,t1_fqnjsvi,1589496529.0,She’s already about a month old and doesn’t have most of her feathers. Do most silkies take longer to get fully feathered or is that a male thing ? I keep looking back at her baby pics when she was all chick fluff 😂🥺
BackYardChickens,fqj8uf7,t1_fqgk2jg,1589406618.0,She’s my only hen that doesn’t like me so she won’t let me get close enough to boop her 🥺
BackYardChickens,fqfos78,t3_gifv4h,1589328800.0,Looks just like my little baby silkie 😄☺️
BackYardChickens,fq400qv,t3_gg50sc,1589072212.0,What breed is the bottom right chick? He looks just like mine 😱
disneymagickingdoms,fpxapb6,t3_gg165j,1588978945.0,"On the calendar, they’re giving us a free beauty and the beast chest on Monday I believe. That probably means that they’ll be for sale as well. There’s also a free Aladdin chest sometime in the next few weeks too so those will most likely be for sale around that time. So the only others that haven’t been circulated yet are Alice in wonderland, lion king, Snow White, and mulan. So maybe those will be for sale in the coming weeks!"
BackYardChickens,fpw68fh,t3_gfwlra,1588957972.0,Looks like a polish! So cute
ACPocketCamp,fpuqf1m,t1_fpunq6f,1588920288.0,Me too! I’m so glad I was able to get every item 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fpterbm,t1_fpteh79,1588889916.0,I love all of these especially since two are in the actual park !
ACPocketCamp,fpqw3u2,t3_gf1cwd,1588833997.0,I was just thinking this. I was so excited to see what else they’d have and I don’t like one item out of it all. But I guess the good thing is I can save my reissue material for next time 🤷🏼‍♀️
chickens,fpqthva,t1_fpqrb1t,1588831767.0,Aw that sounds like my other bantam rooster. He picks on my d’uccle a bit. My d’uccle is so sweet he doesn’t do much fighting back lol. He’ll ruffle his feathers and stand tall and eventually gives up. He also sometimes gets stepped on by the hens the poor little guy. He’s like a little baby! 😄
chickens,fpp6xa6,t3_geeezi,1588797024.0,"That tiny squeaky crow🥺 If he’s a d’uccle, I have a one as well. He’s so small and sweet ! I haven’t heard him crow yet but I hope he sounds that adorable"
BackYardChickens,fpj7dsr,t1_fpj41il,1588658793.0,My boy is actually pretty friendly and doesn’t mind being held. I think it’s because I spend so much time with him and hold him a lot. The girl seems to still be kinda scared of me but will let me hold her. I think she’ll warm up to me as she gets older 😄
BackYardChickens,fpifp3j,t1_fpi3w9u,1588639955.0,My boy might have himself a new girlfriend then! 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fpgy5l3,t1_fpgomgj,1588611599.0,The best they can for now. Not having all the land makes it hard but my fantasyland should be finished once I open up my last two plots 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fpgy29g,t1_fpfxn30,1588611551.0,My other lands are arranged the best they can be for now since I don’t have all land available. Once I get my two last fantasyland plots then I can do a final rearrangement for it and I’ll post that! 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fpfhfj3,t1_fpfh3ud,1588571340.0,Sure! It’s so hard to place things in this game so it’s super helpful if you have a guideline 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fpfg6x0,t1_fpf2fen,1588570295.0,I’m glad you like it! 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fpfg2jb,t1_fpfa1a4,1588570195.0,Honestly don’t even want it now because I’d have no where to place it 😂
disneymagickingdoms,fp6am9y,t3_gbd22y,1588349043.0,I just got that one yesterday too! I was so happy. Congrats 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fp39742,t1_fp2v5pb,1588275280.0,I wish I had one!
disneymagickingdoms,fp392uo,t1_fp2ti0k,1588275219.0,Ooo I might put my hot dog stand there then to make it even better
BackYardChickens,fouyvd8,t1_fouyfpn,1588092639.0,Wow thanks for the info! I free range mine during the day so I’m hoping that will help with any tensions. It definitely depends on the individuals so I’ll have to keep an eye on their behavior as they grow up but I have hope that they’ll get along 😄
BackYardChickens,foss55m,t1_fosr8rj,1588036921.0,Thanks! I hope my boys get along for the most part. I’m going to try keep their spurs trimmed so hopefully that will help a little bit if they do have their fights
BackYardChickens,fospf8f,t1_fosoud9,1588035328.0,Wow I bet they look funny! Is that from them fighting with each other?
BackYardChickens,fospc1t,t1_fosp27l,1588035278.0,I think they will. It’s been funny watching them fluff up their feathers and pounce on each other but I know it could get more serious as they grow spurs. They spend about a minute like that and then they’re off running around together lol!
BackYardChickens,fosoohn,t1_fosm07n,1588034897.0,Thanks! One of my roosters is a bit more submissive because he’s just a tiny guy. I definitely see him giving up trying to be boss lol. Even the hens push him around. They free range too so I’m hoping that will relieve any tension and give the hens room to get away
ACPocketCamp,fose0r3,t1_forfdx3,1588028868.0,I realized they were and planned on crafting some stuff. When I came back to play the event ended so I’m still bitter lol. I hope they bring back the items sometime in the future !
ACPocketCamp,fosdv18,t1_fosdn4b,1588028779.0,I want to get more cookies because I got every item from the Sakura one except for the picnic set! I look forward to the daily cookies because sometimes they have a special one in there lol. Does the cookie plan include the new cookie like merrys Sakura and mitzis aviary?
ACPocketCamp,fosddjl,t1_forpqj8,1588028513.0,I just started playing a month ago and acquired about 500 leaf tickets from all the rewards. I didn’t know how hard they would be to get once I had already completed all the missions and now I’m regretting buying a bunch of cookies with all my leaf tickets 😭😭
ACPocketCamp,for9zph,t3_g9191d,1588008692.0,Love it 😊I’m still sad I didn’t know about the thrifty chic event 🥺
chickens,folnkqg,t1_folm9z0,1587866168.0,That’s what I think she is too!
BackYardChickens,fogzcay,t1_foejdkp,1587758725.0,Poor little guy. I’ve never had a rooster before so I’m trying my best to make sure my dudes are friendly and manageable. At least I know my hens will have someone to look out for them!
BackYardChickens,foehzsz,t1_foe3584,1587704273.0,I try to handle mine as much as I can and let them get used to me feeding and picking them up. I have a 2 month old rooster right now and he’s perfectly nice to me but keeps his ladies in check lol!
disneymagickingdoms,fodmnn2,t1_fodewg1,1587686578.0,Yay that’s so great! 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fod9wkj,t1_foc6d13,1587682063.0,3 new characters is still good! You’ll get those attractions eventually 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fod9qu0,t1_focxcue,1587682009.0,Surprisingly no lol ! I know a lot of ppl get frustrated with the other chests because they always get decorations and so do I 😂it was nice to actually get some good stuff in the chests
BackYardChickens,fod8ijp,t1_fochews,1587681605.0,Aw I’ll have to see how friendly my baby turns out. He may have to go to a new home if he’s too mean 🥺
disneymagickingdoms,fob89h8,t1_fob7j8k,1587657144.0,I think it’s because there’s no decorations! It’s way better than the chests that have 4 decorations and 3 concessions in the mix 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fob832v,t1_fob6gxe,1587657094.0,At least you got a character! I’m always happy with a character or an attraction. And Bruce looks so cool in the water 😄
BackYardChickens,fo9fjnj,t1_fo9eddp,1587618125.0,Hmm I may wait it out and see how he is. He’ll be raised with my roosters who are still chicks so he may get along with them. I don’t know where I read it but it said the roosters would fight to the death but that may have been the standard size. I’m glad you had a good experience with them though. That gives me some hope for my little man!
chickens,fo5sm22,t1_fo5noy4,1587534391.0,Thanks! I’m hoping I get to keep them. I may have to bribe the neighbors with eggs lol!
chickens,fo5mzds,t1_fo5meif,1587529761.0,I’m so scared about their crowing lol. I live in very close quarters to my neighbors and I’m too attached to my babies to get rid of them. I don’t think I’ve seen my boy show any rooster behavior except he’ll try stand up real tall next to the ladies. My other rooster has already started kicking at my girls and trying to crow. I have no problems picking up my little d’uccle and he doesn’t care at all. He’s a sweetie and I hope he stays that way !
chickens,fo51yf6,t1_fo50biy,1587515774.0,Yep he’s probably the submissive rooster. The other is pretty outgoing. I’ve seen him kicking one of my stronger willed hens already. I haven’t seen any type of that behavior from my d’uccle though but I’ll have to see how his behavior changes as he gets older
BackYardChickens,fo4q6pg,t1_fo4pl80,1587509094.0,Wow I hadn’t heard of those. I checked for them on my pet chicken and they’re about 23 dollars. I may end up needing 3 or more but maybe I’ll be able to keep all my roosters lol !
chickens,fo4hsso,t1_fo4h2dh,1587504666.0,Aw I’m sorry about your hen. He’s so tiny I don’t know how big he’ll even get! I have another rooster the same age and he’s already tried crowing. Haven’t heard my d’uccle try to crow but it’ll be interesting to hear what noise will come out of his tiny little body 😄
BackYardChickens,fo3ejxu,t3_g5fn1x,1587485559.0,I have the same problem with my two surprise roosters. I’m planning on keeping them though since they’re so friendly and I’m attached. But I may have to end up rehoming if they’re too loud for my neighbors 😭
BackYardChickens,fnyrktq,t1_fnxaabx,1587373000.0,I guess I’ll have to wait and see. It’s a clean legged bantam that’s all I know 💁🏼‍♀️
disneymagickingdoms,fnwbcxr,t3_g48pq9,1587315123.0,Mine had a person with 170! 😅 I had 41 and played almost constantly (and I had every single character for tasks)
BackYardChickens,fnw7qt2,t1_fnw3rnw,1587313114.0,Thank you so so much. I’ve already done the spices in the food and the elderberry and sugar in the water. I used a dropper to give some of the elderberry water and now the worst looking one is eating and kicking through the food instead of just standing in it and pecking at random things. I’m going to try find some raisins and maybe give some bread and hopefully they’ll pull through. I got my chicks from tractor supply. I had a feeling at least some of my chicks would be sick because the bin I got them from had a few not so good looking chicks. The worker said no they’re fine they’re just hurt. I don’t think those chicks lasted the night. I still took a chance and got 4 babies anyways. It’s just sad that the workers are so untrained because they could’ve removed the sick chicks from the bin with all the healthy chicks who likely got sick as well
BackYardChickens,fnu4amu,t1_fnu41mq,1587254269.0,I’m hoping I can keep any light out of their coop and let them out of the coop around 9 am to keep the crowing to a minimum. Especially late at night or really early in the morning. I heard someone put insulation in their coop to try muffle the sound as well. Lol I’ll figure something out as I go 😄
BackYardChickens,fntzr7w,t1_fnslpap,1587251721.0,"https://imgur.com/gallery/OauVMop
Here’s a few pics of her/him. I’m having a hard time accepting this lol. I’m just worried about the noise more than anything"
BackYardChickens,fnsh6y5,t1_fnsbuz6,1587221540.0,So she’s definitely a rooster? I guess I should say “he” lol
BackYardChickens,fnqux96,t1_fnmol0x,1587172767.0,So I ended up finding silkie chicks at my feed store today! They were in the assorted bantam bin and I got so excited. I thought it was funny the worker said they were all the same type except different colors. Luckily I know better than to listen to that lol. I got so lucky 😄
BackYardChickens,fnn6b2y,t1_fnn4je6,1587085349.0,Me too! I’m not in a super big rush since I have 6 six week old chicks. I’ve got a polish in the mix and she’s adorable with her little head feathers lol. Thanks for your help!
disneymagickingdoms,fnn2opn,t1_fnmy4g5,1587083128.0,"I wish they’d bring the 1st one back again. It’s so sad seeing 2, 3, and 4 and not having the 1st one lol. I used to sell all concessions and decorations so I never cared for them and now I regret it so much !"
BackYardChickens,fnn2irf,t1_fnmvp1s,1587083028.0,On MyPetChicken the shipment date is October lol! And it may let me order 2. I’ll definitely keep an eye out for some from my local stores for a bit but when I can’t wait any longer I will probably resort to those two websites 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fnmw311,t3_g2kk24,1587079283.0,This makes me so sad because I’ve recently been trying to acquire all the concessions and I really wanted the Oswald stand. Not even worth it to try in this. Hopefully they’ll have it available again soon 😢
BackYardChickens,fnmt174,t1_fnmr309,1587077604.0,When you ordered your 3 did you have to have a minimum purchase of $30? I’m checking it out now and I added three chicks and it tells me I must purchase at least $30 worth of product
BackYardChickens,fnmper7,t1_fnmol0x,1587075648.0,I’ll have to look at them! Thanks! Did you happen to order straight runs? I imagine silkie roosters wouldn’t be a problem though since they’re such a docile breed
BackYardChickens,fnmp7op,t1_fnmlx7r,1587075545.0,I have heard so much about their personalities! I have a few chicks that aren’t silkies but they’re super friendly so I imagine silkies are like them but 10 times sweeter 😄
BackYardChickens,fnmlhpg,t1_fnml1zs,1587073589.0,I wonder if my local store even has any new ones in. Last time I went they were all gone and I heard many places are sold out due to all the people buying them because of covid-19. The good thing is rural king gets chicks year round and not just in the spring! Ill be on a hunt for silkies for awhile but I’ll find some eventually and they’ll be worth it 😄
BackYardChickens,fnmkuaa,t1_fnmk41j,1587073247.0,Hmm before I knew much I thought I had snatched me a silkie from TSC but then I did a bunch of research and found out nope not a silkie. Lol. I think my best bet is to keep an eye out at TSC or check with rural king. I wonder if rural king is strict with the minimum amount of purchase. TSC let me slide by with just 2 at once
disneymagickingdoms,fnlecg2,t3_g2gldv,1587052063.0,They really want us to spend money. They could’ve easily made the reward for top 25. Now anyone can just buy like 10 dollars worth of tokens and get to the top and keep spending money to stay there
BackYardChickens,fnjecek,t3_g1xxt2,1586997255.0,My little chicks are learning to do this! It’s so cool how smart they can be
disneymagickingdoms,fnhe0ub,t1_fnhdah4,1586960600.0,I hope they do! They kinda don’t do much for new players. Even though I’m a really old player lol. I think I didn’t try enough to get the costumes because I think at the time I hadn’t seen the movie. But if I was a new player I’d be so mad because almost all of the content is impossible to get!
disneymagickingdoms,fnhd6ik,t3_g1rif4,1586960134.0,Don’t be sad. I have zero of them 🥺
ACPocketCamp,fneviu6,t3_g1cktp,1586896634.0,"I believe the beige hat with a black band can be purchased at the market place. I have one and that’s where I got mine. You have to visit a few times as the clothing will change from hair accessories and eyewear, to shoes, and to clothing. You may be able to find some other cool hats when they appear too. Also the clothing fortune cookie is only 500 bells I think when it’s available"
disneymagickingdoms,fneoqi7,t1_fnedazj,1586893146.0,Do people not run out of gems or do they far enough ahead that they stop spending
disneymagickingdoms,fnea109,t1_fne6shn,1586885668.0,They’ll pop up and you only get one I believe. Everyone comments their pieces on Facebook or posts them here
disneymagickingdoms,fne6dol,t1_fne5smr,1586883855.0,"Yeah I heard about that. But I think they wouldn’t have a problem doing br’er bear, rabbit, and fox because the parks still have them. So Si and Am could still be incorporated but they’d also have to add 2 characters instead of just one for them lol"
disneymagickingdoms,fne5gsp,t3_g195kk,1586883396.0,I feel like if they don’t make a grandmother willow attraction there’s not many other options. So I’m pretty hopeful she’ll be one! Id like to see ratcliffe too just because I like the villains lol. They don’t have Si and Am for Lady and the Tramp though
memes,fne4yis,t1_fne3wvj,1586883141.0,Aw she seems so sweet. And bringing her chicken?! I would do that too 😂
memes,fne1fhe,t1_fne1342,1586881359.0,I haven’t seen the season she was on. I wish I could watch the older ones somehow. She looks like one of the few girls I would actually like on the show lol!
disneymagickingdoms,fne17wo,t1_fne0oy3,1586881251.0,I hope you get lucky like you did this time! I never would’ve spent so much when I did but it’s kinda like gambling. Once I spent money on 2 I was like well I can’t let that be all for nothing so I must get what I wanted 😂

disneymagickingdoms,fne0l8d,t1_fndwcl1,1586880933.0,I got a total of 5 out of 6 benches in the big hero 6 pack. At least the last chest was baymax but 5 benches out of all 6 chests is really messed up!
disneymagickingdoms,fne0ej8,t3_g183w8,1586880836.0,That’s so great! You got a lot for just 2 6 packs. Awhile back I really wanted oogie boogie and bought like 5 of the packs so I got everything in the process 😂 I guess it has paid off for this event!
disneymagickingdoms,fndtj9u,t1_fndtdyf,1586877210.0,I spoke too soon. I got my puzzle piece shortly after wondering about the clues lol. I forgot they pop up
ACPocketCamp,fndot5g,t1_fndng5g,1586874618.0,Thanks I just tried it out. It would be cool if it worked for the campsite as well! I can never get good photos of my campsite lol 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fndms1n,t1_fndmlkm,1586873443.0,Definitely Pocahontas! I just haven’t seen any “clues” yet I wonder what they are

Here’s my layout but it’s not really a good one. I love how I have the Mickey and friends, toy story, and frozen all in one area. The onward attractions will be most likely be moved once I have room. I will have to figure out how to place the concessions so they won’t be all crammed in one area! But with this layout I’m at thrill level 3"
disneymagickingdoms,fn86p2k,t1_fn7o2lm,1586735065.0,Very true. And for big Disney fans it’s so cool to have your own little kingdom with your favorite characters running around! 😄
TsumTsum,fn7npsx,t3_g02yqr,1586723982.0,I’m so jealous! I always wanted a whole collection but now that im older and have my own money they aren’t really sold anymore and if they are they’re expensive. Your collection is so great! 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fn7dw0w,t1_fn70hb0,1586718397.0,Thanks! I still just feel guilty spending so much on a game but money can always be earned back I guess 😄
disneymagickingdoms,fn6yf1c,t3_fzz5f6,1586709779.0,"I’m ashamed but I spent almost $50 USD on the wreck it Ralph chest packs which got me everything from the collection. I just bought 1 of the chest packs this morning for big hero 6 and I got all decorations except for one chest I got baymax. I plan on buying more later today (shamefully) because I really want the rest of the attractions I don’t already have. It’d be better if they gave you more for the 6 packs you buy with actual money so you don’t have to buy a bunch. But one good thing, I bought the Winnie the Pooh chest with gems and I got Christopher Robin on the first try although he was my last character and I already had all the attractions. It was better than getting a decoration though!"
BackYardChickens,fn5ype6,t1_fn5x57f,1586680686.0,Hmm I would agree but other than her comb she shows no other rooster behaviors and she clucks just like a regular chicken. She’s got no rooster feathers or spurs. She was laying eggs too just last year but she’s getting old now. I’m so curious now because I guess it’s not normal for hens to have such big combs 🤔
