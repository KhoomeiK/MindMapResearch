Justrolledintotheshop,fjsmm90,t1_fjslwvc,1583598609.0,".... ok I hadn't even thought of that.  That's 10x worse because I live in Fargo, North Dakota.  It's 20 below and you have to put on a production of Fiddler on the Roof just to go home from work.  It just keeps getting worse."
Justrolledintotheshop,fjsk79m,t1_fjr1v9q,1583597932.0,What the fuck.  I didn't know this was an option and neither did you or most people in here for that matter.  Who the fuck thought this was even remotely a good idea?  Yeah just need to Jack my car up and take this wheel off to replace my battery.  Wouldn't something hitting the battery there be a concern?  I am afraid of caustic chemicals and a punctured car battery would be a nightmare for me.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fjsj9m8,t1_fjrxcs6,1583597584.0,"You got the right idea.  I would put it in a similar category as phobias.  It's the warning center of your brain overreacting to one particular thing.  I have severe general anxiety so I just have to make sure to keep the rational side of my head in tact and cope as best I can.  Don't worry, be happy."
classicwow,fjsg8wf,t1_fjok7j1,1583596657.0,"Panic is something else.  If you've never truly panicked before it's beyond overwhelming.  I have a severe anxiety disorder which leads to random full blown panic attacks and the first time I had one I called my mom to inform her of my impending death.  It's funny to look back at that now but oh God it was fear so great that my entire body was on fire.  

After years of medication and experience I don't freak out when I'm panicking anymore. Not still hurts more than any physical injury I've ever encountered but I know what to do now.  

Hopefully she learns from that!"
fightporn,fjls5vc,t1_fjlh789,1583453217.0,"I'm not picking a fight with a dude wrapped in caution tape.  The warning is on the fucking packaging.  Also, he's probably whacked out of his mind on something and I'm more afraid of how far someone will take a fight than how much better of a fighter they are.  

People who are willing to go to the extreme will pull weapons, go for the eyes, keep hitting if the person is out, and any other unhinged action that could cause massive damage or even death.  No thanks.  

Actually I've decided to not pick fights.  Tis a silly thing."
fightporn,fjlrrsr,t1_fjki9jb,1583452963.0,Everyone has flashbacks to mom and THE VOICE.  Either a whoop'n was coming or you're gonna spend the next hour staring at a wall in the corner.
fightporn,fjlqufp,t1_fjk72v6,1583452361.0,"That was pissing me off.  Then when the other guy started to get the upper hand they let it go.  Either break the fight up definitively and protect all parties or hands off.  Restraining one person and letting the other guy tee off on them is going to end very poorly.

Also the guy who started the fight couldn't have telegraphed his intention any harder.  Wow.  Lowered stance, hidden right right hand, inching closer with eyes locked on target.  It was like watching a cat go from ""fuck whatever man"" to ""this pidgeon gon' die"""
cringe,fjk8cb7,t1_fjjl303,1583422226.0,Haha I was waiting for Randy Savage to bring out some creamer and let us know who is rising to the top!
cringe,fjk7r4j,t1_fjj2b4z,1583421876.0,That was my first thought.  If I'm tired when hungry then I'm grumpy and keep to myself because otherwise... I grump at people.  Hrm!  Good thing I big brained that problem!
cardistry,fjgu2f7,t1_fjg6mqe,1583335503.0,I'm currently learning the revo and struggling a bit.  The charlier and swing cut I have down pat but I want to learn the revo and then the Sybil.  That trigger looks so slick.  Man it takes time to learn this shizz but it's satisfying once you get a few moves down.
