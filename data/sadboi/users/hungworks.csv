depression,ewzl0sq,t1_ewnr5wf,1565897215.0,Was meditating and wondered what it would be like to keep that peace and connection out of the meditation. Would that be like rising?

depression,ewn63om,t3_cp1ajy,1565569566.0,"I overcame my depression and constant feelings of not fitting in and belonging with meditation. I was a mechanic and approached the whole thing in a very mechanical way until I found the perfect tuning for my body and mind… and you know how the story goes, you get those two right and the soul reveals itself.

Similarly to how you have gauges on your car for the various mechanical systems, I discovered there are levels for our body, mind and soul as well. This made it really easy to fine tune the tuning process.

I know there are many masters out there who swear that you need to learn from a master to really get meditation right. It's not like we need to go within and re-engineer everything. That's highly impractical.

Body, mind and soul; 3 gauges, only 5 levels each! It doesn't get any easier. With the right tuning, it's like clockwork… you can pretty much set it and forget it. That's how wonderful our humans really are!

I just focused on the tuning method and simplified it so that it’s easily repeatable and tested it out with difficult situations. 3 gauges, only 5 levels each! Body, mind and soul. It doesn’t get any easier…

Eventually, nothing phases me anymore; people, circumstances… I even had the opportunity to test it out in court and just sat there and tuned myself the entire time and everything just went my way. It felt like the judge and I were being connected! The ruling was better than I had wished for! I did get a little too excited during the end though!

Now, everyday, I just take a few minutes to re-calibrate and get realigned, mostly after my meals. Not only did I overcome the depression and anxiety, everyday is like a dream. I’m happy for no damn reason!

And I can feel it in my heart. It’s like a real sensation coming from my chest. The technical term is the heart chakra and it has something to do with energy. I don’t care about all of that though. I just know that it feels really good and at any moment, I could burst into tears of joy for I am so blessed!"

awakened,ewgmzlk,t3_cnomjr,1565385571.0,"I'm not familiar with Christianity however I do have this to say. Going to church does not guarantee awakening and many who go are still stuck in their minds (dualism)... that's if they have made it above the level of body domination... just look and see that most are still struggling with their bodies and you get the big gap between the awakened and the struggling. The message of Christ cannot be understood in logic, only experienced in being... Oneness is a blessing... which goes hand in hand with having compassion and mercy on our other Ones. ""To whom much is given, much will be required."" (Luke 12:48) What better challenge is there to face in the Universe? Great that you continue to practice! Love your friends and pray (imagine) that they awaken to Christ within... Let your faith make you sure to be acknowledged... and have that be your righteousness."

awakened,evr7ivo,t1_evq3xch,1564702788.0,Thank you for saying that. I appreciate you interacting with this post. I know how hard it is to get attention for different things. I should share that I layer this app on top of binaural beats while focusing on tasks such as writing or designing.
awakened,evq2yp6,t1_evq1mex,1564685322.0,Thanks for the feedback and conversation. It's being developed so that it does not interrupt any other audio/video players on the device... like the navigation apps... can you picture that and imagine how it would be?
