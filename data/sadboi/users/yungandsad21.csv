to treatment."

depression,f232q3u,t3_dbkken,1569904016.0,"I went to rehab with a girl who had tried to commit suicide; she took a whole bottle of pills and lost exhaustion to her brain for 27 mins before the doctors brought her back. She is now paralyzed and completely disabled yet cognitive, she knows what happens and has her memory fully intact but is forced to live in a vegetative state for the rest of her existence. Suicide may not always go as planned in fact it’s a lot more common then not, that you survive it. If this doesn’t terrify you then idk what will."
depression,f232jes,t3_db0bhz,1569903836.0,I know this may sound rude but for the people commenting..you guys are somewhat lucky u can sleep. Imagine not being able to sleep for days at a time because your so depressed and fucked in the head. Not being able to take a break from all your negative thoughts and suicidal ideations. I’ve had to be hospitalized bc I had psychosis from lack of sleep. It’s torture.
