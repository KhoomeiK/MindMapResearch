Hair is normal, everyone has it. I am very blonde with fair skin, so I don‚Äôt feel pressured by society to shave mine because you don‚Äôt really notice it. However, in the summer when my skin darkens and my hair lightens, it becomes much more noticeable, and every year I get comments about how people don‚Äôt realize how hairy I am. 

It‚Äôs just hair! And a lot of people already know this and don‚Äôt care. It protects us, keeps us warm, etc. It‚Äôs a part of the body and has a function. That said, if *you* don‚Äôt like it, do whatever you want to it! I have a friend who swears by the little razor things, and another who uses some cream. As long as you‚Äôre feeling good and confident, the other opinions don‚Äôt (and never will) matter.

But they were very quick to respond, we actually found the place on zillow, went to tour it, applied, and got approved all in the same day. 3 months later, the place is amazing, a total hidden gem, peaceful, good amenities, and the landlords are chill, we almost never see them and they are quick to fix things. 

As long as you can see/tour the actual unit before applying, its not a scam. I would NEVER recommend giving anyone money before you have been inside and know you like it. Otherwise, you‚Äôre in for a scam or just a bumpy ride (which can sometimes be worse than a scam when you have a 12 month lease agreement).

I usually work in Sales in LA, so hours of traffic everyday and working about 50 hours a week. It‚Äôs been really nice to relax, focus on creative projects again, and have extra time with my partner, as we usually only share 1 full day at home together, and the other 6 at least one of us is working.

Luckily I was furloughed without pay, so I have unemployment $ to keep me on track with bills, and my job is waiting for me to come back in a month or two.

You could also consider adding a tall cacti to the shelf! It would bring the eyes up a bit. Even swapping the globe and zz plant would give some more height. 

If you wanted to give it more of a tiered look, you could get some tiles (terra cotta or decorated ie: mexican tiles) and do a border along the bottom shelf and around the opening. This would break it up a bit from looking so long. 

OK, final answer: I would go for the desert vibe and paint it terra cotta, add the accent tiles, and try to get some tall plants or a upward growing vine. You could also add decorative piece, like the skull if it suits you, about halfway up. 

Here‚Äôs some examples/inspiration from pinterest. I recommend scrolling through there - at the least you will figure out what you really don‚Äôt like.

This last time I saved up to prepare, and actually signed for my new place just over a month before my old lease would end. It allowed for more options since I was more flexible with dates, and a much more relaxed moving process too because we were moving locally. We just lived in a shitty old place before, so it was easy to move everything over the course of a couple weeks rather than all in one day. We also got our landlord to release us early from our lease so he could rent it out sooner, but that might‚Äôve been unique to our situation.

beauty,fpatqps,t3_gc3t06,1588455524.0,"I (24F) have an entire arm sleeve of visible tattoos that are pretty random but not offensive. There are more, but they are typically covered for work related stuff (legs, stomach). I work on the corporate side of the restaurant industry doing Catering sales and managing the Catering teams within 15 restaurants in Los Angeles. So on a daily basis, I‚Äôll go work one of the restaurants with the team in the morning, have 1-3 lunch time appointments with Catering clients (downtown offices, studios, tech, etc), and then I usually work from one of the restaurants or home in the afternoon. I have to wear a plaid or flannel shirt, so usually I just keep the sleeves rolled down if I‚Äôm meeting with clients in a particularly boujie office or if I know its going to be an older crowd. With the young/hip offices they could care less and usually at least one person will ask about one or two of them. Same thing when I‚Äôm in the actual restaurants, whether they‚Äôre open for business or not. Sometimes I will work a day in our corporate office if I have internal meetings, or I do a lot of video conferences, and on those days I wear whatever I want and usually go out of my way to show off my tattoos! 

Hope that helps a bit! If you can cover your tattoos with a long sleeve you should never be kept from any type of job.

Similar situation, we moved in, saw one dead roach but didnt know it was a roach. Our next door neighbor fell and became immobile, lives alone so he started piling up his trash inside without telling anyone, suddenly we have a non stop stream of roaches in our kitchen and bathroom. 

Differences start here - our landlord sucked. We told him multiple times, and he tried to sell us his cockroach killing stuff. We got our own, and it was killing some but not all. It was a fucking nightmare. Eventually (and unfortunately), the next door tenant died in his trash filled apt and the roaches started to go away after his family cleaned the whole place out. 

From my understanding (I live in Los Angeles, CA), roaches are to be taken care of by the landlord/management. Bed bugs are a different story, but roaches are a pest, and especially with your neighboring unit obviously being the cause. They need to get rid of them or provide you with a different, roach-less unit to move into. If they can‚Äôt do that, they need to either pay for you to go to a hotel while they tent the building, or release you from your lease early without any financial punishment. 

TLDR; Fuck roaches and make your landlord fix it or free you from the lease.

I also found out this past year that I have ED hyper mobility type, so they say having a strong core and muscles will help me to utilize them correctly, rather than ‚Äúcheating around‚Äù because I‚Äôm flexible enough to. In the meantime, it should also help us to be able to isolate the source of the nerve pain or damage they are still trying to figure out, which is likely the root cause of the trochanteric pain. It‚Äôs very exciting! I cried a lot of happy tears after we got off the phone. The pain has been so straining on my already fragile mental health, so knowing it‚Äôs not going to be back to a level 9 in a day or two eased so much anxiety and dread! That was a long update, but you‚Äôre so sweet to follow up so I had to give you the details! 

I‚Äôm so glad you got a diagnosis. That always seems to be the hardest part. My younger sister has been dealing with severe chronic sinus infections for almost 6 years, and they‚Äôre still struggling to get a full grasp of what the issue is. You and I are lucky that we have an idea of what we‚Äôre up against!"
ZeroWasteVegans,fp083rx,t1_fozxewb,1588204248.0,"It is! My fridge paper towels are the last bit of them from my bulk Costco shopping days, haha. When they run out though, I‚Äôm wondering if it will be better to just let everything touch the fridge directly, or use kitchen towels to line like I have been. We live in a rental apartment and the fridge came with the unit, and as a vegan it sometimes grosses me out wondering what else has been in there. Irrational thought I suppose, because it‚Äôs been cleaned thoroughly on multiple occasions!"
ZeroWasteVegans,fp07qw3,t1_fp04ory,1588204060.0,"Love that thought! I used to compost when I lived in a ground level town home and had a small yard. Now I‚Äôm in a second floor apartment, but I do have a balcony... do you think it will be smelly or attract many bugs? Our balcony is a very peaceful and sacred space for us, so I would be bummed to dilute that energy. Thanks for the tips!"
ZeroWasteVegans,fp07b6c,t1_fozyfga,1588203831.0,Wow! I‚Äôll have to look into that further. Sounds helpful for camping trips too!

ZeroWasteVegans,fozophi,t1_fozlwpz,1588194205.0,"Awesome, thanks so much for sharing those! I live in Los Angeles, CA, where the winters can still be 80-90degrees at times, so I don‚Äôt know if it will be possible to unplug. However, I will consider the experiment, even if for a few days when we have a bit of cold (usually there‚Äôs a week or two in November and January where it will go down to lows of 30degrees... I know... we‚Äôre spoiled). 

Great idea to buy berries local! I‚Äôm hoping when the stay at home order begins to lift, farmers markets will open back up and I can shop there again for less wasteful produce and specialty items."
festivals,foznvpm,t3_ga7hw1,1588193800.0,"Here are my typical festival highlights (I almost exclusively go to camping festivals)

Packing 

Road trip

Set up ur campsite and make it magical n cute (don‚Äôt forget a lil Bluetooth speaker and some lights to help find it at night)

Introduce yourself to the neighbors 

Explore the festival grounds

Put together your best outfit 

Add glitter! Everywhere! Or face paint!

Don‚Äôt forget water 

Set times?! Make a loose schedule of sets/workshops I want to be apart of 

Camp cooking

Make new friends!! 

Dance the night away 

Check out all of the vendors and support some small ethical businesses!

Go for a swim (if it‚Äôs on a lake or there‚Äôs a pool)

Snap some pics, candids and some shots with all the friends! 

Give away some little crystals or bracelets to people you meet and connect deeply with 
Howl at the disappearing sun while it sets


Usually we also sprinkle in some yoga, fun lil activities (I like bringing bubbles, or we will bring paint supplies to a mid day set and set up a little craft blanket), and then of course there‚Äôs the experience enhancers, if you will.... mushrooms, lsd, maybe a lil dmt if you‚Äôre feeling it and of course weed to carry you through! 

Of course at the end of it all, pack up the entire site, and leave it better than you found it! NO trash!"

Also, this was right after a 2 hour fridge/pantry cleaning session. I‚Äôm furloughed so all the passion projects are going down!

AutoImmuneProtocol,foywwjq,t3_g9rbsb,1588180693.0,"I am new to AIP, but long time cannabis connoisseur and been struggling with chronic pain for the greater part of the last year. 

Look for options that have high CBD content, and purchase from a licensed dispensary if they exist in your area, because many CBD products sold at drug stores / regular retailers are not tested or regulated. Be aware that CBD and THC coexist within the marijuana plants, so it is likely that legitimate CBD products will have a small amount of THC as well, but that should not cause any psychoactive effects.

In my experience, smoking flower can cause a flare up because of the combustion that happens within the veins and decreases blood flow (ok, this is my very trivial understanding, I admit, so please feel free to fact check that). However, topicals like a CBD salve or lotion can be applied directly to the pain spot. I have also had success with capsules that had both CBD and a low THC content. Edibles also help me tremendously when it comes to sleeping through the night. I would recommend edibles that have both THC and CBD, but try to get an Indica dominant strain (this is more relaxing and calming than Sativa and should help you sleep through the night). 

I hope you are in an area that has access to quality cannabis, because it can definitely help A LOT to get you through the rough days (mentally too, even CBD allows the mind to relax without being psychoactive). Wishing you health and healing.

Edit to add: I still enjoy smoking, but have found that using an oil pen is a much better way for me to get the benefits I want. And, I don‚Äôt have to go outside to hit the pen because it doesn‚Äôt smell. It just has a light, fruity smell usually, depending on the strain. Also, if you do have a good dispensary nearby, ask them these questions! There is usually someone there who is pretty well versed on different methods of cannabis consumption."

ChronicPain,foyfw8s,t1_foxq48u,1588171791.0,"Wow! So glad to hear you have had similar relief. My younger sister also has done a few rounds of steroids and they helped her so much.

I‚Äôm actually feeling really good this morning, and not the usual ‚Äúits wearing off and I overdid it‚Äù feeling that I have after taking NSAIDs. 

I am hoping to hear from my doc today about options moving forward! It seems like my healthcare provider is kind of disconnected and none of my docs ever know whats going on until I get them up to speed. Having comments like yours really helps to know what to bring up as options! I have never dealt closely with any issue like this before, so it‚Äôs all new to me.
