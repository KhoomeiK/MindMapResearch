Advice,fqkb8f3,t1_fpik0ua,1589423741.0,"The victims have really low self-esteem. The abuse obviously plays a role in this, but also abusers often gravitate towards ppl that struggle with their self-worth. Which is where you get the phenomenon of how some ppl seem to ""attract"" abusive partners. Due to their low self-esteem the victims fear, either consciously or unconsciously, that the abuser is the only person they will ever find who's willing to be in a relationship with them. Although the abuser hurts them, s/he is also a source of validation and love (read about the cycle of abuse and lovebombing). When the victims leave/break up with the abuser, they struggle so much without that validation and with their fears of being alone that they often take what *seems* like the path of least resistance to some kind of peace and return to the abuse.

Obviously theres a lot of cognitive dissonance and denial that occurs with this process (""it wasnt that bad"", ""i deserved it because i provoked him"") but anecdotally and one thing i dont see talked about a lot is how so many victims are single mothers and how hard it is to get by in the US as a poor single mother. Daycare here isnt subsidized at all and is disgustingly expensive. Public transit in a lot of places is inadequate. If youre poor and a single mother and you are disconnected from family (emotionally or geographically) or your family is trash and cant be trusted you are fucking struggling HARD. They leave him, they get a taste of paying bills and rent and addressing childcare with the resources of one person instead of two, and their resolve to change things starts to weaken. Its a structural flaw in our society."

relationships,fpvyork,t3_gfugoy,1588954201.0,"I have a hyper controlling mom too so i know how much it sucks but. I think the odds of you having a productive discussion with her are probably pretty low. It's not right or fair because you are an adult, you have autonomy over your own body, and you and i both know you arent ""mutilating"" yourself 🙄 or doing anything otherwise harmful. But given the way you describe your parents i think you should start to think about how to handle it if their current attitude doesnt change. Only wear them while you are out of the house to keep the peace? Wait to stretch them until you're moved out? Or say ""fuck it"" and wear what you want and emotionally prepare yourself for what you know will be coming, i.e. the judgment and the lectures and silent treatment? Any of the above would be valid, only you know what your tolerance for adapting your behavior vs enduring unpleasant scenes is. Good luck 💜💜 you wont be living there forever 💜"
