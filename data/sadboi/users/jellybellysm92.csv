He has so far accused me of cheating with some random guy who was in the same store as me at the same time, and told me to take my daughter and leave right now, I told him I will straight up call his mom if he tries to uproot my daughter like that 😅 now I'm of course getting novels about how I need to know I was wrong and that he was justified in trying to hit me. And of course how he knew all along I was trying to stab him in the back 🙄  I've been here before, and I know I dknt want to be in this type of relationship.

He also sees himself as the calmest most rationally tempered person ever, realistically he throws the biggest fits, to the point of trying to physically intimidate me, and then blames it on everyone else around him.
