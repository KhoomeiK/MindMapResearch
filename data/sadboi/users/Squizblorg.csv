I could never hurt them like they hurt me, I could never make them experience this pain. Right now I am the good guy although I feel defeated.

science,fekd2lk,t1_fekb7jr,1579197513.0,"Im not advocating anything. I am sharing an experience thats relevant to the post. You want my opinion on drug use? Sure. With all the drugs i took and all the damage i did to my body it was alcohol that nearly killed in the end as it had reduced my liver to 1/4 of its function. But what other people do with their body is up to them, that is none of my business. As long as they are not hurting anyone else. Im not going to tell people what not to put in their bodies, if they are conscious and understanding of their decision then it is theirs to make. The same as I am not going to go and yell at mountain climbers saying ""STOP ADVOCATING SUCH DANGEROUS ACTIVITIES YOU HEATHENS!"". Thats their choice to risk their body. 

Now with DMT and psychedelics in general, would i recommend them? No, not really. I did DMT because it is very quickly metabolised and the DMT i took only lasts about 15 minutes (5 minute peak), to me this was the safe choice to make FOR MYSELF as i was afraid of psychedelics. I have had friends end up with psychosis because of acid and a family member who had a bad reaction to shrooms.

Now the spirituality thing. So, the understanding i came away with was that everything in existence is essentially a vibration, a frequency. Right? So thats the scientific basis, i then put a metaphor on top of that ""So the universe is like a song vibrating everywhere and we are resonating with it, we play our solo then return to the song"" and there you go thats basically it.

The effects are similar but can vary slightly and also vary depending on the individual. I was sitting up but lost all my senses and went... ""somewhere else"". I felt like i lived in that place for thousands of years, time sort of stopped existing. But yeah it was just 5 minutes. So for me it was about 0-2 minute come up, 5 minute peak, 5 minute fade back to reality and then maybe 30 minutes of residual emotional effects but that could have just been because of the experience.

You aren't going to have the same experience as taking the strongest hallucinogen known to man, not even in a deprivation tank (Ive actually done both to be able to compare them). There is nothing magical about meditation either, magic actually doesn't exist (sorry if this is a revelation to you) I understand your attempted point but unfortunately it falls flat. As far as brain chemistry goes you might be interested to know that there is an endogenous production of DMT in the human brain. But whatever. I am not claiming there was anything mystical about my experience, it just made me look at things differently and build my own spirituality which is more of a scientifically based metaphor than anything."
science,fejv4y7,t1_fejtryw,1579186564.0,"I had a life changing experience on DMT (the key ingredient in Ayahuasca but I smoked it) there was a period of time after the experience that was light (I suffer from bipolar so perhaps this was more apparent to me because of the contrast) I had never felt so good about life. That slowly dissipated over a week or so. 

However the choices I made and the things I believed I had learnt have stayed with me (7-8 years later) I will forever see the world in a different way and as an atheist I found a spirituality that didn't have to involve religion or religious thinking. Having a spirituality and an ever lasting sense of the interconnectedness of everything is hugely helpful to anyone particularly those with a mental illness like depression or bipolar. 

The strength of those beliefs dips and climbs. It's always there but sometimes it's less accessible due to state of mind. 

What I learnt on DMT was what would be the main thing that helped me get sober 4 years after taking it. I will forever believe the things I learnt in that 5 minute eternity."

Here are the details of voluntary and involuntary admission in NSW at the bottom of this message, sorry for the messy link. I wish you luck with your recovery! I'll be at 3 years in Feb.

AusLegal,fc6rhj2,t3_eghuga,1577487616.0,"When you went into the ER had you self harmed or mentioned suicide or major depressive symptoms? Some of these things can result in you being scheduled and it's up to the discretion of the hospital. If they perceive you as a threat to yourself or others. I have run from the ER because I know that's the procedure when they go get the mental health team. I've also voluntarily admitted myself to a D&A clinic, the first time I voluntarily discharged early, it was possible but they did make it difficult."
GalaxyFold,fc1hil8,t3_efnts1,1577318945.0,It is against the rules but mods don't really do much around here so you are fine. How come you have decided to sell?
GalaxyFold,fc06w1m,t3_efd5df,1577281151.0,"I haven't had it happen yet with my fold but I'm not surprised, I stopped using the wireless charger with my note 8 cause it would actually get painful to touch it was so hot. The increase in heat is kind of unavoidable with wireless charging, if the weather is hot it's probably going to overheat."
GalaxyFold,fbua8rp,t1_fbu39wy,1577110758.0,Yep it was you I had in mind! Thanks for the update. Are you afraid of using the disc side?
GalaxyFold,fbtwa9g,t1_fbtpjf6,1577099297.0,A while ago someone mentioned using quite a nice one with the fold with no damage or scratching but that was maybe a week or two after release so not sure about long term usage. Hopefully they see this post
bipolar,fbgl557,t3_ed5gb3,1576852455.0,"Embarrassing.. funny.. hmm
I once climbed onto one of those big highway signs in the middle of the night and waved my bits at truckers then wore my friends out who desperately wanted to get rid of me so they could sleep and so I went on a long walk/adventure.

Another long walk, can't remember my reasoning but decided to walk and flip a coin at each road I arrived at to decide which way to go. 8-9 hours later I was very very far from where I started with little memory of how I arrived there. Phone was out of battery and had no cash, no one would talk to me or help me so I walked to a court house and asked some cops for directions even tho I was carrying illegal things. They helped me and I got home somehow."
GalaxyFold,fb7g8yh,t3_ebpszp,1576589049.0,"After getting mugged a couple years ago for my iPhone 4S I understand the paranoia, I blame most of the experience on me forgetting street smarts in my home country but even here in Aus I get paranoid. But honestly it's seems like your average person has no idea what it is, even had someone think it was some cheap crap phone. Just be smart like you would with any phone, try avoid flushing it out in public in bad areas, use minimally if possible and stick to the front screen.

I've only had 2 people since September recognise it's a folding phone."
GalaxyFold,fb2u0s3,t1_fb2k05t,1576457675.0,I wrote a comment but thought I better just go and verify what im saying so I spoke to Samsung. If you damage the screen by installing a screen protector you void your warranty and screen replacement deal. Seems pretty stupid to take that risk.
AskReddit,fax0goi,t3_eas91h,1576377376.0,"Just talk to them like you would anyone else, the awkwardness comes from overthinking the interaction. You don't have to mention age or age related pick up lines."
bipolar,fapi1xs,t3_ea9fet,1576288489.0,The last time I ever went to a therapist this happened (about 10 years now) I got angry because I felt guilty. In my angsty teen years it just validated my ideas that no one was equipped to deal with me even if they were paid to.
GalaxyFold,fanefjd,t1_fanbkik,1576237139.0,"I think it's more to do with the tech under the screen for the s-pen, there is likely no way to have that extra layer fold yet. Folding it could possibly cause inconsistencies and glitches when using the s-pen or it might just break entirely when folded. One day though, I'm sure"
GalaxyFold,fakijs4,t1_fakgz2v,1576167730.0,I'm conflicted with it. I like that it fits into the groove but it just looks so smooth when it covers everything except the hinge. The flash thing is interesting.. is there another sensor there or something? If not it's definitely a confusing design choice. Post an update of you manage to fix it
GalaxyFold,fakcm5b,t1_fak6834,1576164833.0,"It's a bit odd but the phone is actually shaped like that, the skin fits into the recessed part. Not sure how it would go if it were put over that lip. I forget who it was.. some YouTuber had a robot skin like mine that wrapped around completely. Looked really smooth kind of wish that was the one they sold"
GalaxyFold,fah3xjs,t1_fagqxjx,1576078598.0,"What do you notice it most with? Or is it just a general issue? I mostly use the larger screen for games, videos and pictures. Could be why it's less apparent for me? My eyes might be kind of crappy, got my new glasses today so might see if that makes it more noticeable."
GalaxyFold,fah3dxh,t1_fagr6s5,1576078241.0,"They hang around here with nothing but negative unsubstantiated bullshit to spew and have no interest in constructive conversation or debate. 

In response to their reply, I don't care who likes the fold and who doesn't, I have said I would hesitate to recommend it because it's not for everyone but hanging around here with nothing more to say than ""it's trash"" is pathetic and childish. Find something constructive to do for fuck sake."
GalaxyFold,fagook9,t1_fagduml,1576065856.0,Please don't engage with me. You should know by now that I'm not interested in interacting with you after last time.
GalaxyFold,fagoiez,t1_fagedo3,1576065655.0,"No idea, I'm not joking when I say I forgot about it entirely but maybe others are more attentive? I heard it could possibly be fixed through software but I have no clue as to the validity of that claim. Doesn't bother me at all"
GalaxyFold,fagasp8,t1_fag88tm,1576046165.0,"If you are on a website or text based image while using the large screen and you scroll up and down really fast there is a slight difference in the speed of the display on one side so the image distorts slightly. I've only ever noticed it while testing by scrolling up and down really fast but since then forgot about it and don't see it.

Edit: it happens regardless of what is displayed but seems to be most noticeable with text"
GalaxyFold,fac3li2,t3_e8e58i,1575933011.0,If you search comparison on this sub I posted a pic with the fold next to a bunch of devices inc note 8 and iPhone 6+
australia,fa5hrqc,t1_fa5bq43,1575815256.0,"Your advice is hugely appreciated. There is no questioning their identity, they talk about overly personal things and don't hide their name, to the point where they have given out their own address and caused problems for themself (although I don't pity them). I will go through it all and collect everything then compile it into a timeline of events. Others have reported them for their videos with moderate effect but I want to make sure it ends. Enough is enough. Thanks again"
AusLegal,fa5868k,t1_fa4jg3l,1575812544.0,Thank you! That's super helpful. Hopefully something can be done about this
australia,fa57w80,t1_fa4kt51,1575812444.0,"1. Yes, it's hard to go into to much detail about who it is. They are someone who has tried to reconnect with her multiple times and has attempted to manipulate her. (Not an ex)

2. It has been happening on and off throughout this year.

3. The videos are posted on YouTube and because her name is mentioned she then gets messages and friends requests from people on Facebook.

4. We haven't but it wouldn't be too hard. Kind of keen to find out what could be done before compiling it all. 

Thanks for your response!"
australia,fa4gnpw,t1_fa482yk,1575804529.0,"Thanks, I'll post something there"
GalaxyFold,fa2ugau,t1_fa26fk2,1575786841.0,"No idea, honestly they weren't super professional and I wasn't too interested in keeping the conversation going"
GalaxyFold,fa0yb7b,t1_f9y4wm2,1575761990.0,"They didn't say, they said there is some kind of machine they have to use and there is currently only one in Aus which makes me think the location might not be any of the stores."
GalaxyFold,f9t01z5,t3_e6shdb,1575604853.0,You can usually get a preview but not the entire text as far as I know. There might be an app or launcher that allows you to see full texts. I prefer having a touch more privacy so I've never tried for full text.
GalaxyFold,f9szt9d,t1_f9spij0,1575604672.0,That is odd. Wouldn't have a clue why... Humid environment? It's quite humid here but I haven't noticed issues yet.. that or just heat in general are the only things I would think could cause an adhesive to deteriorate..
GalaxyFold,f9sgrfv,t1_f9s49pa,1575592122.0,Is that a screen protector?
GalaxyFold,f9m5c5j,t3_e5r1er,1575442182.0,"No regrets, some compromises but I was aware of them before purchase. Had mine since September. I do maybe slightly regret that I didn't get a model made for my country, 5G is useless here and using Samsung care is a bit complicated. Could have saved $500 but... Oh well"
GalaxyFold,f9jmsxv,t1_f9jm2yq,1575380086.0,"It appears to be normal. There is supposed to be some movement in the hinge and it does loosen. You can take it to be tightened and cleaned at a Samsung service location, that service is free (confirmed in Aus not sure about elsewhere)"
samsung,f9eqo7l,t1_f9elola,1575248994.0,"I guess we all have our different reasonings, I would like to protect the hinge but the options available for protection don't appeal to me. Some might be okay with sacrificing looks for protection, I guess I'm just superficial.

Edit: I keep mine in a shock sock anyway, that feels like enough for now"
