relationship_advice,flr8pyo,t3_fqkb03,1585415266.0,It sounds like a phase to me. Ive been with my husband for close to 25 years now. High school sweethearts. Ive felt this way through several parts of our relationship and afterward I wind up realizing it was me....there was something off with me and I would just direct it at him. I can't tell you how you feel however the best bit of advice I ever received was this... don't make permanent decisions based on temporary feelings.
relationship_advice,flr5oxs,t3_fqc5qh,1585413504.0,"She's severely depressed. She's using food and mental escapism to blot out the depression. It's become a crutch. Ive been in her shoes. I used food and games to mute my mental instability. I ballooned up to 400lbs. 
I never knew it though. I would see my face in the mirror and just not know. 
It wasn't until a friend posted a picture of me (a whole body shot) that I looked and was like....wtf is that really me??? I made life changes and lost around 200lbs.
Harsh realities are hard to deal with. 
You obviously love her but you need to be blunt with her. You need to nicely tell her that you're unhappy, you're no longer attracted to her, you can't be physical with each other and she's killing herself and making you watch it."

hysterectomy,fiitrop,t1_fihsqkx,1582426689.0,"Totally this...when you keep your ovaries they go into shock from the surgery and it throws your hormones into chaos. I cried over everything! I was staring at my husband and asked him what he was thinking about and he said ""Australian walkabouts"" and I thought for sure he meant he was leaving me and lost my shit on him. Be prepared for some crazy fluctuations."

Hashimotos,f6klqou,t3_drppfm,1572914767.0,Try the AIP diet.... (auto-immune protocol) you eliminate everything that can have adverse reactions in your system then slowly start reintroducing them slowly. It helps a lot of people with autoimmune diseases. Its hard to stick to but it's the only thing that really helped me.
Hashimotos,f3nmub1,t3_dh3tj9,1570999790.0,I feel horrible. Everything hurts and aches. I can barely stand without crying but I'm on my feet 16+ hours per day (two full time jobs). I'm so depressed I can barely function and i just don't even want to live anymore.
