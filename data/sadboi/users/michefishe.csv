tumblr,fokqd6s,t3_g7t20c,1587846939.0,"I never thought the fortnite dances were even cringey... why are people always shitting on what young people do? Just bc we're devoid of happiness and innocence, doesnt mean we gotta take it away from everyone else. Like dont worry, their time'll come, but fir now just let them be happy."

mentalhealth,f9wdtxp,t1_f9wd0x8,1575691068.0,"Yeah Hippocrates had a pretty good idea of mental illness, especially for not having the technology and years of research we have today. He linked mental illness as being caused by physical ailments (imbalances of the humors) and the brain (which he saw as the center of thought, intellect, and emotion). 

I would also like to point out that the Greeks were still not perfect and stigma still did exist, especially for externalizing illnesses like schizophrenia which was thought to be punishment from the Gods and such. Still, I'm impressed with the the Greek physicians and how did seem to be going in the right direction with their basic understanding of mental illness and even treatments (i.e. prescribing exercise and forms of counseling)

Edit: words"

college,f4r9nkz,t1_f4qs17h,1571764705.0,"Actually if you want to be a counselor, it's probably better to get a MFT or a MSW. PhD is more for if you want to be a counseling psychologist (helping with chronic/severe illnesses) or a research professor. 

Idk where you heard that a master's isn't enough for psychology. Maybe not for research psychology or academia, but for counseling it's definitely enough."
