Splatoon_2,fn3e9kb,t3_fz5w3s,1586618947.0,"-Focus on big areas to ink instead of small ones and if an area is well trafficked by your team don't spend too much time on it, it will be crossed alot. Look at the map to find large un inked areas or bits with enemy ink.
-Don't panic
-Its okay to use the aerospray as a beginner but its a but op because of its high ink coverage. ( after using the aerospray, I recommend the sploosh-o-matic, it has good ink coverage and does alright damage, so its easy to move on to)
-You'll get better in time :)

Its just youre brain making connections that arent there cos there has to be a reason, and thats easy said but ik how hard it is to think differently, so dont let his anger leak into you. Because its his anger, not yours."

She just thought the whole point of me talking was a betrayal and only for the sake of vilanising her. She wouldent let me walk away when she was yelling at e about it, if I tried shed dig her nails into my arm really hard. Sometimes but rarely making me bleed, if I struggled alot. Im now 18 and out of school. :)"

And if there saying things are true when there not and vice versa and otherwise dhcking with you then they are. The fact you have the doubt in the first place means that they probably are."
