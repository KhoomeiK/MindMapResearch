raisedbynarcissists,fjo9rw6,t3_feg7rd,1583523436.0,"I didn't say things like ""I love you"" until I was an adult in college. I started saying it because my friends said it, we held hands and hugged and sat close together on couches and beds, watching TV or playing video games or just being on our phones. My friends helped normalize it for me. I have a dad I adopted as an adult (the father to my older siblings) he and his brother and their wives always end the call with ""love you lots"" and honestly my heart sings every time I hear it. Now that I know what it means coming from ppl who actually mean it. Recently my big brother started saying it on the phone with me and honestly I just melt. My other older brother started hugging me and saying I love you whenever we see each other about a year and a half agoand it still leaves me a little stunned. It's taken time but we're moving on, we've cut ties with our birth mom and we're healing, each in our own ways. Both of my brothers have kids and wives and they are raising them with love and understanding. It's amazing to see them. I love my family with all my heart, and this time I know it's real."
depression,f80y3ty,t3_dyazjo,1574142059.0,"I felt this way my last 2 years of high school, I called it apathetic suicide thoughts. It was mostly because I was in an unhealthy environment and I couldn't take fighting against it anymore. I've moved past it though I still struggle with major depressive disorder. Looking back I don't think I wanted to die, I just wanted out of my current situation. Once I graduated high school and left for college it got a lot better. I don't have those thoughts or desires anymore even though I still have depression. I don't know how this info helps except to say that they can and will go away at some point and there's probably something triggering them.

Just remember that your brain is a fucking liar and these thoughts are temporary. Death is the only permanent thing we experience and future you will thank you for not giving up on them."

One of them being birth control and the amount of Estrogen in your body. This interaction increases nightmares, night terrors, and all kinds of sleep disruptions.
