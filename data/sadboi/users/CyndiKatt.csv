Anxiety,fncr808,t3_fo6h6w,1586844591.0,I'm glad I'm not the only one. I also have cardiophobia so I have to tell myself it's not a heart attack and it's not covid-19. Multiple times a day. It's so stressful. Plus I'm always  air hungry which doesn't help with the chest tightness.

AskReddit,esnv222,t3_c8mib8,1562151315.0,"You're an idiot. 
Vaccines prevent illnesses like whooping cough, measles, and polio. All of which could kill your child and other people's children if they're not vaccinated. We have to keep the herd mentality. If we can keep most of the herd vaccinated the ones that aren't vaccinated due to medical reasons will be safe. 
Somewhere along the line some fucking hippy said ""Hey man the government is trying to make you sick."" and all the internet morons believed it ðŸ™„"
