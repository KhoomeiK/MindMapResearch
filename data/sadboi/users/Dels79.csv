I hate to say this, but I have to be totally honest with you. A prognosis of 1-3 months could be a stretch. Given your cat has a swollen abdomen, things could get very difficult for him and more miserly very quickly. Keep monitoring him, but if you feel like he's struggling, talk to your vet about euthanasia. I know it's not something you want to face, and speaking from experience it's literally heartbreaking. It's an inevitable decision that will come along, but it just might have to be sooner than you'd like, as a kindness to your boy. 

I'm so sorry. No words can express how hard it is to deal with losing a beloved pet. They're more like a family member. Give him loads of cuddles, but don't take it too much to heart if he backs away a little here and there. A swollen abdomen makes them very uncomfortable :(

Firstly, I am so sorry for your loss, this is horrible. 

Secondly, your parents should absolutely have called you and had the vet talk to you on the phone or facetime to explain things. This was your cat, not your parent's. They were doing you a favour by taking the cat in to see the vet. Any decisions/information should have been relayed to you immediately. They took all the discussions and decisions out of your hands while you were none the wiser. A huge mistake on their part. They may have thought they were doing the right thing by sparing you such raw heartache, but they had no right to do that. 

I can completely understand how you feel. You were betrayed and denied the chance to say goodbye to your cat. He wouldn't even have needed to be put to sleep so soon if you had been informed. You could have had him home with medication for a time, and the possibility of further treatment if the vet felt he could have a chance. But you were denied any of this thought process. I'm so sorry. 

However, I really don't believe any malice was intended. Your loss is very raw at the minute and I think, given some time to take it all in and grieve, you may regret not wanting to speak to them again. Their reaction to your anger was probably more out of shock as they clearly don't realise just how much your cat means to you. I bet they are feeling pretty horrible about what they did. 

I would say don't shut them out completely. Just wait a while and see how you feel. I hope in time you'll be okay x"

This was beautiful to read. I'm glad you have this man as your stepdad. Maybe one day you'll feel comfortable enough to call him ""dad"", but it's also okay if you don't. You've clearly been through a lot, and trauma does things to us, it puts up barriers that are hard to break down. Hell, some even have a ton of barbwire on the top with an ""Access Denied"" sign. 

There are many ways to show appreciation and affection, and reacting so positively to his dad-jokes is definitely one of the best. I think it's clear he adores you, and I'd say he gets such a kick out of your smiles and laughter when he does his jokes with you. I'm glad you have him in your life :)"

I suppose by integrating tarot into your journal entries, it would make for interesting reading when you want to reflect on a thought or experience!"
AskReddit,fjjoq7m,t1_fjjo5h7,1583406567.0,"I think that's great you got yourself out there to socialise. I used to be a much more social person before things in my life changed and I ended up mostly reclusive with a ton of anxiety issues. I'm now slowly starting to get something of a life back and it feels good. 

I agree it's definitely something you need to take time at to be good at it, to cope with certain things. I hope to be at a point in the not too distant future where the anxiety isn't an issue any more. I'm glad it's not an issue in your life anymore."

AmItheAsshole,fjiklpl,t1_fji0nwh,1583369709.0,"> I told my Airbnb host in Amsterdam that I struggled with depression and she said ""maybe you should lose some weight."" 

I've had people say this to me too upon learning that I struggle with depression. Like, losing weight will ***really*** undo all the shit that I've been through, and thus wipe out my depression. Fuck. Right. Off. 

People are idiots."
AmItheAsshole,fjijgis,t3_fdhv4l,1583368984.0,"YTA big time. Jesus, how dim are you?

Your friends are right - you have no tact. That is NOT a question you ask. What does it matter to you if he used to be slimmer? Why does it matter that he's overweight? And teasing him about his weight makes you even more of an asshole! You don't do shit like that to someone you consider a friend. That's something a bully does.

It doesn't matter that Mark defends you and says it's okay. I can 100% guarantee it is NOT okay. He's just trying to avoid confrontation and keep things on an even keel. He's sparing you embarrassment even though he's probably cut to shit inside from your comments. You say he's a nice person and is a great guy to hang out with. This friend group clearly love the guy and don't want to see him be hurt, which is what you're doing. You not only hurt Mark, but pissed off a group of people who hold him in high regard, so of course they're going to be defensive and tell you where to go.

Open your eyes and realise what you've done. Apologise to Mark and everyone else for being thoughtless, tactless and downright rude. I'd be surprised if they don't ghost you completely after this. Idiot."

Christ on a bike, what the hell is wrong with people? They ordered pizza and your stepdaughter couldn't munch on snack food until it arrived in what, 30 minutes?! Talk about being an entitled brat! And why the hell was your wife not telling her to stop whining and wait for her food, instead of yelling at you to give in to said entitled brat?! 

Holy shit. Like, you said it was your only meal of the day!! Wtf is going on these days with people, do parents not know how to implement the word ""NO""?! Or teach them some humility and patience? 

I suppose it's obvious I don't have kids. But holy shit, if I did there would be none if this nonsense. You eat what you sit down to and of you don't like it? TOUGH. 

SO much NTA, OP. I feel for you. Your wife and stepdaughter are major AH's here."

AmItheAsshole,fjdvfsp,t3_fcvpq1,1583260026.0,"Holy shit, OP. YTA. A major, astronomically huge AH.

Your brother's girlfriend isn't an object to play ""tit for tat"" with. She's a real person with very real feelings. As is her boyfriend, your brother. Her family are struggling with accepting him which is bad enough in itself. Who the hell are you to say that because of this, she's not acceptable in your family?!

If I were in your brothers shoes I'd tell you to fuck off. Never mind banning them from your wedding, he should be glad he doesn't have to put up with your disgusting attitude."
