About as critical as every other fool who dumps opposing opinions in an “enemy” category. How stupidly combative.

PublicFreakout,fqze2fi,t1_fqzcsv9,1589765424.0,"It’s as basic as “THE NAUGHTY WORD, GET HER!”

A huge user base of Reddit are teens that have been conditioned to think one way on certain topics, but never critically. Racism *is* bad, I’m not arguing against that, but they’re so consumed in whatever “justice” they’re trying to get they approach unthinkingly.

Is there racism in this clip? Yes. 

Does that mean that person is bad? Yes.

So we can attack because she’s bad? Yes.

Assaulting an old woman is just because she’s a bad person? Yes.

It’s not so convoluted as to say it’s mental gymnastics, but when you’re taught the nasties of racism, any sign of it is immediately the enemy that must be stomped out. That’s not to mention however many do it for the virtue signalling. There’s no activism in cheering on this act, but “haha Le justice is served to filthy racist Karen” curries points with the same types."
