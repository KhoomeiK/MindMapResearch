dating_advice,fdk3qpq,t3_eleoxp,1578495327.0,"Something similar yeah but worse.  Not dated, but I had a friend. She have really bad anxieties and really bad depression. Which I don’t have any problem with, but she constantly acts like she’s the victim and always tries to make you look like the bad person for not trying to “understand” her situation. But what got me to stop being friends with her was when my dad passed away 2 years ago and i wanted to talk to someone but she didn’t even care she turned the convi around and made it about her (like always). And how she always expect me (everyone actually) to drop all our problems and be there for her. If we’re not she goes and complains about how she doesn’t have any real friends or shit like that. Cut her off then."
dating_advice,fd36gbc,t3_ejrv7o,1578155190.0,"I definitely agree. I don’t want someone who picks and chooses when to text me. I truly understand we’re all adults and have lives and work, i don’t need you to text me every second but if you disappear on me for days and tell me you’re busy........ yeah i’m not having that."
depression,fcrvl2p,t1_fcqksif,1577907209.0,It’s kinda hard to be there or help others when you can’t even help yourself.
depression,fcp1vej,t1_fcoyuki,1577847917.0,"And i don’t wanna be that person who keeps telling them to not give up, that it’s okay, that it will get better one day because they know that and most of the time it actually upsets them more (i’ve seen it happen) also, i once suggested to another friend to maybe talk to a therapist but they took at the wrong way and got mad and i don’t want the same thing to happen this time. and please don’t apologize it’s no problem at all."
depression,fcoy8vx,t1_fcoxv5m,1577844898.0,LMFAO okay yeah that’s true 🤣 but he actually always leaves his door unlock for me 🤣🤣
depression,fcoxbw1,t1_fcowyhd,1577844154.0,"Honestly, sometimes I just wanna show up in his doorsteps and give him big hug but idk if that’s right because he is being very distant right now and shutting everyone off for some alone time."

dating_advice,fcllgje,t1_fckxqdp,1577750553.0,"I totally agree, it will hurt, LIKE BAD, but i’d rather have them clear things out than give me false hope and lead me on."
dating_advice,fckurzy,t3_eho31b,1577733636.0,"I was talking to this guy for a over a year and actually now pregnant with his child. We hang out all the time go on dates or just hangout at his place lazying around, tell each other the i miss yous or i love yous but claims he’a not ready for a relationship because he have too much going on in his life. Which I understand, I truly do, we’re all dealing with things that other people don’t know about. To me it sounded like right now isn’t a good time for him but sometime in future he’ll open up his heart to me. So i waited (obviously it got me nowhere but a soon to be a single parent). You see the “i’m not ready for a relationship” line does nothing but give us false hope, and puts us in tough position thinking we don’t wanna waste our time in case they find someone they’r ready for but then we want to stay because what if it’s the truth, they really need time. So if he leaves you feeling confuse and not putting an effort to clear things up, leave. We’re a little old for this guessing game when they know exactly what we feel towards them. It sucks, but  it’ll be a lesson learn to how not to shrink ourselves ever again."
dating_advice,fckgrhb,t1_fckdvmn,1577724974.0,"One thing i like to tell myself is that it sucks, but atleast we tried. We got to know what it feels like, it hurts at the end, but not everything in life is meant to be a beautiful story anyway. Another lesson learned."
dating_advice,fcj5klf,t1_fcinhvh,1577677819.0,"The I like you but i’m not ready to be in a relationship bs? I was in this kind of situation and one thing I can tell you is if they want to, they would. We can’t force someone to be ready for something we’re ready for and you don’t have to wait for them to make up their mind."
