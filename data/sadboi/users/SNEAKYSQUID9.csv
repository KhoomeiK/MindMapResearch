Showerthoughts,fe6jbpk,t1_fe6gw0b,1578892745.0,"Haiku's are poems that don't necessarily rhyme. Does that mean it's not poetry? I agree with op that music preference can change based on emotions, within the genres you like. Someone who is strictly a country fan is less likely to play a fast tempo upbeat rap song to get hyped up. They will most likely play a faster tempo upbeat song of the same genre or closely related. I'm not by any means saying this is the standard for everyone who listens to music, but you have to understand just because you may not like that certain genre or artist, that doesn't mean they don't put in the same or more effort than your favorite genre or artist. Yes, there are musicians or artists who make music that may sound horrible to the listener but if they are happy just creating sounds then who is to say that their music is bad. I could say country is just a bunch of hillbillies and rednecks who like play banjos, sing about beer, cheating on their woman, and something about and endless summer nights, but they are just people creating sounds and forming words just like rappers. Idk to me music is just an expression of self of experiences. So just as country music is explaining a lifestyle or experience as is rap music, or any other music really."

And I hate it. I usually use the same towel two or three times depending on how dirty I was/how wet the towel is. So grab that off my closet door. Then check if I have underwear. If I don't... Well then it's laundry time... If I do then okay cool. I don't worry about shirts or pants because I have a billion shirts from work and only 2 pairs of jeans.... That's if I have to go to work or out. If I don't have to work, I'm usually just putting on underwear or leggings, a shirt, and one of my hooded cardigans. This is all before I even shower most of the time. Now to my actual process. Use toilet, wash hands, turn on faucet (I typically know exactly where not to cold but not to hot is). Then it's hair, face, ears, then body in that order. Then brush teeth. Then decide if I need to trim facial hair. Then deo for the b/o, ONE...I reapeat ONE... spritze of cologne.

I presume your in middle school or high school? Either way, I can kinda understand where your parents are coming from. They love you and presumably want what's best for you, but at the same time YOU ARE YOUR OWN PERSON. No matter how much they want to change that, they cannot. You're still young, you still have a lot to learn and explore for yourself and the only way you can do that is by being able to be yourself and do what you like carefree. As for your toxic friends. You will lose best friends. You will gain new friends. Rinse, repeat. It sucks, it does. Trust me, or dont. But I've experienced it firsthand. To be honest I would say confront your parents about how your feeling. Obviously keep the suicidal thoughts very low key but tell them how your feeling. Tell them how I the pressure of you being perfect in their eyes is causing you to stress. Tell them mental illness IS A FUCKING THING. Like why are there killers, rapists, people who have multiple personalities, people who want to harm themselves? Because everyone is not made the fucking same. There is no ""normal"" or ""perfect"" person. You are you. If you people cannot accept you for who you are. Honestly, are they worth your your time? Will they better you by POSITIVELY pushing you to be the best you can be? Or will they NEGATIVITY push you down because you are you? Fuck. I need to talk my own fucking advice like fuck....Anyway I'm not saying I have all the answers I'm fucking 27.
