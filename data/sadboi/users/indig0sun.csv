EatingDisorders,fo2bsa3,t3_g59ymb,1587456438.0,"i think the whole point of an eating disorder is that you get yourself into it, in some way or other. I remember the first times i purged i told myself ‚Äúthis is the only time this will happen‚Äù but two years later i‚Äôm telling myself the same thing. My eating disorder morphed into some weird disgusting love child of anorexia and bulimia and at the end of the day nobody shoved my fingers down my throat except myself, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the struggle that I have with eating and myself is my fault. 
I‚Äôm sure there is more to your eating disorder than just wanting to be skinny, whether it is some childhood trauma or other emotional barrier that you have learned to cope with by purging. Honestly, EDs are basically one giant fucked up coping mechanism. It‚Äôs solving one problem while giving you a million other problems that are hugely life threatening. 
gotta love the ED life tho right :‚Äô)"
tattoos,fkgefgh,t1_fkfp1fo,1584157282.0,"It‚Äôs an original poem that‚Äôs pretty personal to me and my mental health. i wasn‚Äôt gonna share then i remembered this is the internet so who fucking cares right ? It is titled ‚ÄòKilling Myself‚Äô. I wrote it a while ago so it can use a touch up. 

Devoid of meaning and direction. 
Moving in circles blindly searching for 
a destination. I‚Äôm a bookshelf
Without books: Incomplete.
The only journals I keep are about killing myself.
 
Every afternoon is sleeping away pain. Unsure
Where tired ends and useless begins. Always
Aching for a point or  purpose. 
There‚Äôs no way to ensure
That tomorrow won‚Äôt be as rainy as the last. Plays
Are in two acts, but my life is just the intermission.
 
When does at risk turn into pathetic? At
What time do bloodshot eyes and
Blood soaked thighs turn beautiful? 
I have a scat and piss swarmed mind,
This is me."

Buffalo,fk8knf3,t3_fh1n6y,1583957855.0,"I attend a SUNY and have mixed feelings. I know it‚Äôs for the best as almost all of the kids in my school are from downstate where the most infections are, but i feel terrible for the art and performance students who can be really set behind by this if there isn‚Äôt an alternative for what they could do..
Just yesterday we got an email from the uni president that classes will proceed in person..now THIS!! still waiting on an official email from the president but everyone is very anxious and most of all heartbroken. 
On the bright side...all of the people who live off campus (myself included) plan on going back to school anyway and just having a 2 month long party üòé cowabunga dood"

The number in the scale doesn‚Äôt always define how someone looks, it also depends on muscle tone and fat distribution, but that‚Äôs something i try to keep in mind! I‚Äôd like to lose a few more pounds ideally but i‚Äôm very happy with where i am now :)"

progresspics,fdp2yf4,t1_fdp2c71,1578618751.0,"thank you! I work full time as a landscaper over the summer so i basically spent all day every day doing physical labor, so that was a big part of it. I also went to the gym 3-5 times a week and tried to work every part of my body and run a mile every time i went! I also liked goin on distance runs outside. The biggest difference I made was my diet and eating less calories.  That‚Äôs it pretty much :)"
