DopamineDetoxing,fq55dc9,t3_gehj5o,1589093046.0,"hello! i am an 18 year old girl from washington state. i've been pretty addicted to my phone, youtube, and social media for quite some time now, but last year i went through a rough patch where my depression and anxiety got much worse and i noticed this addiction became even worse.

i've decided to start a beginner level dopamine detox tomorrow (sunday) after i get home from work at around 2pm, and end it after monday night. after that, my goal is to do a beginner detox every friday and eventually work my way up to doing an intermediate detox.

i think it would be cool to have a partner to share goals, strategies, and improvements with! please message me if you're interested! i know i have the potential to do this and break my habits, i just need that extra push and some consistency!"
