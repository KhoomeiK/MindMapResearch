I actually disagree with Maher on his take that this shouldn't be investigated.  Dems certainly set a precedent with Kavanaugh, and if they don't investigate this, it will look like the most hypocritical thing ever.  I don't blame people for calling them out for their hypocrisy right now.  Not to mention, I think a thorough investigation would clear a lot of people's minds on how they feel about this case, myself included.  As of right now, everyone on the internet is playing judge, jury, defense, prosecution, etc.  I would like to see the actual deal, with witnesses and everything.  But it needs to happen quickly.

But at the same time, even if I feel Biden is guilty, I don't really know.  With Trump, I have no question because there are just so many accusers.    And I don't know how to replace Biden in a democratic manner without completely redoing the primaries.  If the DNC picks some random Dem, it's like why did we even hold the primaries?  If Bernie is picked instead, it's definitely going to look like these allegations are politically orchestrated.  Especially with Reade's ""Yup.  Timing...wait for it...tic toc..."" tweet.

It's just such a mess.

Not to mention, there are so many other things at stake here besides these allegations, like the fact that Trump might just decide he's not leaving if he gets reelected.  Biden will at least leave.  Or the fact that Trump is handling this pandemic like a narcissistic sociopath and more people are dying because of it.  Biden would at least listen to experts and has said no one should pay for treatment or a vaccine.  Or the fact that Trump put a climate-denying fossil fuel mogul in charge of the EPA.  Biden at least acknowledges  climate change is a threat, and has a plan to address it.  Big-picture, more people are going to suffer under Trump, so I'm thinking of harm reduction at this point."
thedavidpakmanshow,fq4nqbe,t1_fq4cf18,1589080080.0,"Did you watch the video?  I'm not trying to be snarky, but I thought Maher explained it quite clearly: 

>There are actually some pretty big problems going on right now.  I don't know if you've noticed, but America has turned into a failed state that does a worse job keeping its citizens alive during a pandemic than Cambodia.  And to me, that's a little more important than Tara Reade achieving closure. 

He's right.  If we can prevent a bunch of deaths by voting Trump out that takes priority right now.

When Maher says

>Why should one person's victimhood trump everyone else's? 

he is on the left addressing the left.  When he is talking about everyone else's victimhood he is talking about things the left agrees on.  The left agrees that Covid deaths due to Trump's failed response are a problem.  The left agrees that kids shouldn't be taken from their parents at the border.  The left agrees a President who enables white supremacy is a threat.  The left agrees climate change is a real danger, etc...not hard to conclude the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one.

As for the right hypothetically saying:

> Why should one (or in this case, like 40?) person's victimhood trump everyone else's

This would be the right addressing the left, because (generally, not always) the left is the only side who actually cares about Trump's sexual allegations, or really any of Trump's wrongdoing.   When the right is talking about ""everyone else's"" victimhood here, they would be talking about things the right conceives of as victimhood, but the left does not.  For instance, Government infringing on 2nd amendment rights, or big Government taxing Americans in order to implement a socialist system of healthcare, etc.  So I don't see how the argument is going to hold the same weight.

3. There's too much at stake in this election to care about this right now.    

Camps 1 and 2 both act like they know what happened, but they don't.  Only Tara Reade and Joe Biden know.  Camp 3: well, I get it.  Trump has even more sexual assault allegations against him and his reaction was far worse than Biden's.  And I don't think the country can survive 4 more years of Trump.

But it's important to understand that some people are genuinely disturbed by these allegations, and don't know if they can vote Biden because of it.  I was one of them.  Here is Tara's neighbor corroborating her claims.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq8Pu13CIVo

Now I don't know if the allegations are true, but they do make me uneasy.  To act like people are being ridiculous for being uncomfortable with this is not a good look.  It comes across as cruel.  Reade said she declined to go on Fox News this morning because she had gotten death threats against herself and her child.  My first reaction to that is that people should not be sending her death threats.  But a lot of people's first reaction is, ""Oh please! She's lying!""  

It's just really disappointing and does not sway people who are on the fence voting Biden because of this.  I personally mulled it over for a week and decided I would vote lesser of two evils (Biden), but it was due to people like David, Vaush and Chomsky.  It was NOT due to people attacking Tara Reade.  That had the opposite effect."

thedavidpakmanshow,fpdap7w,t3_gcr6lj,1588523261.0,"I feel the same.  I really appreciate David's take on things and I've also been looking for him to cover this extensively at least once, but so far I've had trouble finding anything."

neoliberal,fp89t4x,t1_fp5mtfr,1588387066.0,"Sanders supporter.  These allegations have made me uneasy, for sure, and even given me a moment of pause where I didn't know if I could vote for Biden.  (I decided I could and will).  But the more I've learned about them, the less I feel I know.  I think this response from Biden is strong, especially this part:

>There is only one place a complaint of this kind could be — the National Archives. The National Archives is where the records are kept at what was then called the Office of Fair Employment Practices. I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there."
moderatepolitics,fp19hto,t1_fp18anf,1588228324.0,"Well, my one friend spoke up when she realized her rapist (a family member) was in close proximity to other younger members of the family.  Realizing he might hurt other people the way he did her is what motivated her to talk about it, although it was extremely uncomfortable and many family members disowned her for it.  

I'm thinking if you see someone who raped or sexually assaulted you about to assume a position of political power, you might feel more inclined to stop them because of the very fact that they're about to get a lot more powerful."
moderatepolitics,fp184if,t1_fp148fx,1588227138.0,"I don't really think much about them reporting years later as I know two victims of sexual assault/rape and both of them stayed silent for years until they spoke about it.  It's actually really common because these experiences are embarrassing and can garner public ridicule, apathy, discomfort or straight-up hatred.  That being said, the more time goes by, the hazier memories get and the harder it becomes to corroborate claims.   

As far as Ford or Reade being politically motivated, it's possible but these women would have to be ok with receiving intense public vitriol and death threats in return for whatever political return they're getting.  It's hard for me to believe anyone would feel it was worth putting themselves through that.  

Despite all that, I hesitate to judge before thoroughly researching each case, because although false allegations are rare, they do exist and they can destroy the lives of the falsely accused.  I believe in due process and I believe the same standards should apply to everyone regardless of political party."
moderatepolitics,fp156t2,t1_fp14f95,1588224721.0,"Yes, Biden definitely needs to address this.  It's not just going to go away if he ignores it."
moderatepolitics,fp13rk4,t1_fp12mfw,1588223598.0,I agree that the hypocrisy is blatant here and I'm liberal.  I don't know enough about Ford's allegations to make a judgment.  Didn't watch the full trial.  And I don't know enough about Reade's allegations yet to make a judgment either.  But I can see the very clear double standards in the way each case is being treated.
thedavidpakmanshow,fp11ph6,t1_fp0klqv,1588222059.0,"This is reasonable.  I've been waiting for David to cover this too.  And you are correct that Trumpists are having a field day with this story.  I have no clue if these allegations are true or not, but we've got to address them."
thedavidpakmanshow,fp116dh,t1_fp0sma5,1588221688.0,"I keep going back and forth on this.  I don't know if I believe it and I hope it didn't happen as well.  I even considered not voting Biden over it after I first listened to the Reade interview with Halper.  But what the hell can we do?  Trump is at the helm during a deadly pandemic and has even *more* sexual assault allegations against him.  

So can we have an investigation into Reade's allegations?  I get it that Dems don't want to tarnish Biden with that but isn't it a bit late?  This isn't going to go away and it's going to continue to drip-drip-drip.  Wouldn't it be better to address it now than wait until October?  Ignoring it looks worse to me.  If the allegations are false, confront them head-on and expose them as such.  And if they're true, yikes.  Can we replace Biden?

2020 is turning into a hell of a year."
AskReddit,fox13pq,t1_fowx6cp,1588131577.0,"> I should also point out that although I’m extremely right wing I believe in defending and supporting ALL Americans. He regularly attacks Democrats as though they are enemies. This is unacceptable. 

Thanks for recognizing this.  Glad you won't be voting for him again."
FriendsofthePod,fowwhg3,t1_foseq95,1588128646.0,"I had doubt about voting for Biden after the allegations came out.  I listened to Reade and found her credible.  I still do.

It wasn't *only* the fact that I thought Biden could've done this that made me doubt I could vote for him.  It was the fact that some Biden enthusiasts were vicious in attacking Reade and they reminded me of Kavanaugh enthusiasts attacking Ford.  It was the fact that Democrats looked like massive hypocrites.

After about a week of mulling it over, I decided yes, I will vote for Biden, but only because Trump is *that* terrible and has even more sexual assault allegations against him.  I could totally see Trump refusing to leave office, not only this year but if he gets 4 more years.  And I could see the GOP and his base doing nothing but supporting it.  So I'll vote Biden, but not happily.

I'm still really disappointed in Dems' response to these allegations.  Better to address it than ignore."
thedavidpakmanshow,fowm0u8,t3_g9yuva,1588122433.0,"I keep wondering this as well.  I tried doing a search and I haven't found anything.  

I like David too but it's definitely past time to cover this."
