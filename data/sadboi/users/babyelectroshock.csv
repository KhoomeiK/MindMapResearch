mentalhealth,erz2yfm,t3_c4i02g,1561424285.0,"They are actually beginning to exist! There’s one in Sacramento. People in the mental health field recognize that the ER is not equipped for mental health emergencies, but this is where most people go. There has begun a limited expansion in mental health urgent cares but there still aren’t anywhere near enough."
BorderlinePDisorder,erj9vc1,t3_c2c398,1560920543.0,"Your son won’t necessarily have BPD, but it’s certainly something to be concerned about. My parent had BPD and it was deeply traumatic for me, I now have PTSD and borderline traits. In my opinion, the best things you can do for him are the following:
1. Help yourself. Do DBT. Maybe take medications if necessary. Get better. 
2. Validate your son’s emotions. If your son brings up something shitty that you did because of your BPD, VALIDATE IT AND APOLOGIZE. My parent never did this and was never capable of it, it was deeply traumatic.
3. Most clinicians consider BPD by and large to be an attachment disorder stemming from conflict/trauma in childhood. Be on the lookout for signs of attachment issues in your child. Seek help from a professional immediately if you spot them.
4. You are probably going to feel abandoned by your son at some point. Cope with this in a healthy way and don’t take it out on him. My mom used to scream at me for stuff like this and would make me just retreat more from her.

Honestly just the fact that you’re asking this makes it seem to me like you are really cognizant of the issue and want to do what’s best for your son. I think you and your son will be ok. Just please consult with mental health professionals."
