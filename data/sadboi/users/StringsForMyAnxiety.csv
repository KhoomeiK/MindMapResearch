Anxiety,f3bo9ib,t3_dgedyv,1570813869.0,"What a surprise, happened to me too, just like everybody else.

But one thing I can advise you with, is that you should go find help in any form or way, and then use that help to try to force yourself to go through what makes you anxious if it's a particular situation like this.

The idea is to try not to fall in the path of avoidance, because the more you avoid the situation, the more difficult it will get to go through sooner or later. 

It's better to force yourself into it (with some help) and slowly getting better at keeping your mind at peace

Try going to class for an hour at first if possible, and from then on, every day a little more time until you are able to go fully relaxed with no problem.
