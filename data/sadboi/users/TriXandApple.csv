These are assets that are required to have a full-time job. Letting a house is not a full-time job. If you're letting a house, there are zero reasons this isn't an additional income. You've really proved the point here. This is not your job, this is a way of leveraging a lump sum of liquid cash.   


\> Put aside most landlords rent on interest only mortgages now as the the government has changed the tax relief and squeezed margins for them.   


Most landlords make bad decisions then. If you were trading stocks you'd be overleveraged and this would be your margin call. Why on earth would someone make this decision other than if they were confident that they had financial runway? It's simply a terrible business decision.

Step 1) Sell house  
Step 2) Pile of cash appears.  


I'll explain this as simply as possible. BTL mortgage deposit is 25% the value of the house. 200,000gbp house in Bristol collects 18,000gbp in rent per year.  
3 years later you've got a sizable portion of the house owned and another deposit. Rinse, repeat.   
15 years later you have 5 houses from a 40,000gbp lump sum.

london,fofgxct,t1_fofel1l,1587735642.0,"Let's be 100% crystal clear here. If everything goes tits up, the maximum money that you lose from a situation in which you can no longer afford mortgage payments because you can't get a tennant is (selling fees+house purchase price+interest accrued on mortgage)-(house selling price). It's important to note that there's not a single time since 1994 that interest on a mortgage has outpaced the growth in house prices. 

The cost of not being able to make your mortgage repayment is literally the commission someone takes to sell your house, in the order of 4 months' rent.

It's the truth with lies intertwined. Nobody could argue with most of what you wrote because you're comparing it to something we inherantly know to be false(taking our jerbsss), giving your argument a massive amount of armor, but in fact, it's quite wrong in many ways.

Let's start with the base premise: that people disliking landlords that take advantage of being wealthy and being able to leverage that wealth to earn more money is akin to immigrants 'taking' jobs. This isn't a correct analogy, is it? We KNOW why immigrants aren't taking jobs. It's because in the workplace there's a minimum wage and a set starting point. An immigrant can't take your job in that sense, that's why we laugh at people who say that. It's non-sensical.

Second off: People dislike landlords leveraging their wealth to earn more money. You know what, I don't really believe this to be that true. More houses need to be built, this renting system is bollocks. But most people understand taking an optimal route if it's open to you. What people fucking HATE is scum landlords taking advantage, providing a poor service, and acting in a preditory way. Do you want proof? Literally this thread is people being angry at landlords not giving a rent break in the middle of a global pandemic when asked. This is the minimum moral responsibility that landlords take on, and some of them are saying no.

Just as an addendum: People are well within their right to be angry about both. They can be angry that the entire country repeatable votes to allow this system to take place, of not enough houses being built; AND be angry that the people who take advantage of this system are showing themselves to be morally rehensable."

CNC,fn8bbdl,t1_fn89uvo,1586737865.0,"Meh, if you have coding experience you're only going to be running through this workflow:  
Post code->run program->see error->work out what's wrong->edit program so it runs->edit post so it makes code that way.  
If you have even a basic understanding of javascript you should be able to get a post that runs 100% correctly in under a day. It's only made out to be a lot of work because

A) Machinists are editing javascript, rather than programmers  
and  
B) There's a bit to understand about how the PP interacts with the actual CAM program.  


Once you've got that bit understood you're easy sailing. I really wouldn't concern yourself about it. It's one of those things, it sucks for a day, and then you literally never think about it for the life of the machine. I used to have a vericut subscription, but actually got rid of it when I realised nothing was ever crashing.   


In terms of drip feeding, I'm going to level with you: It fucking BLOWS DICK. If you're a programmer(as I was before I quit my old job), you'll understand how to make it work. You're going to be dealing with stop bits, baud rates, buffer overflows because the POS 1995 machine can't send the RST quickly enough. You'll fight with it for a week, and just like the PP, you'll find a reliable set of settings and stick with it.   


In terms of how things have moved on: They havn't. A fanuc OI control today still runs BASIC just the same as it did in 1995. They just tarted the display up, but it's still basically a terminal.  


PCMIA was, and still is, up to the MTB(machine tool builder). It'll depend on your budget. There are machines from 1998 with ethernet. There are machines from 2019 with only a serial interface. What sort of budget do you have?"

CNC,fn8951a,t3_g06qos,1586736541.0,"What you want is perfectly possible, but you're going to have to get your hands dirty. Do you have any PC programming experience? As I'm sure you're aware F360 and inventor hsm use the same javascript-based post-processor that's extremely easy to edit.   


But you are going to have to edit it.  


All of the CNC controls are going to blow your mind in terms of how BAD they are. They're pieces of industrial equipment and them being hard to use is job security for 10,000s people so they're the opposite of intuitive.   


As you're aware the only control I'm aware of that actually has enough memory to run 21st century CAM programs out of the box is HAAS NGC(unless you have 50k+). You're going to be drip feeding.   


Fanuc is probably the most universal. Think about it as an android phone, Fanuc would be a Pixel. It runs 'stock' iso g code, that every CAM system has a post-processor for. You will have to edit to some degree because every machine builder put different codes in to control the machine functions (coolant, spindle on etc..). This is going in, finding the function you want and putting the right number in the post-processor. Bonus points if you can find a controller with a PCMIA slot, these ones you can drip feed from a CF card so you don't need to walk between the PC and the machine when you restart a program.  


HAAS are pretty much the same but without the option of having a PCMIA slot AFAIK.

FWIW I own and run machines between 20 and 1 year old, and have perfect one hit PP for all of them, all of them written in house.  


PM me if you need to know anything."
CNC,fn87xvg,t1_fn85e95,1586735819.0,"Look, bollocks to what the insert manufacturer says, this is what you need.  
A polished and ground insert with POSITIVE GEOMETRY. That means CCMT, DCMT or VCMT in most cases.  
A DOC at least 2x the nose rad.   
A surface speed between 175 and 500m/min  
A feed between .25 and .6 mm/rev.  


Here's how I think about it. You need some amount of surface speed to get chip breaking, and if you go too fast you'll stop chip breaking. Once you've got your surface speed range you can play with it without affecting any of your other parameters.  


DOC and feed directly interact with each other when it comes to chip breaking. If you drop your DOC you'll probably have to bump your feed up to compensate, up to a point. There are minimum and maximum values for each.  


For example, if you have a 0.020nose rad(CNMG432), it doesn't matter what feed rate you run at if you take less than 0.01DOC you'll never break a chip. You'll snap the end of your insert before you do.   


If you find you don't have the rigidity to break chips, just go down an insert size. The chip breaker is designed with a DOC in mind. If I were you, on a low rigidity machine, if you want to use inserted tooling I'd go with an '06' size ccmt insert. It'll look small but it's appropriate for the size of the machine."
