You should go to your doctor again and ask if he could test what bacteria it is. when you start taking to many antibiotics which don‚Äôt work it could get chronic. I also recommend to eat cranberries and drink much much water. I had way to many UTIs in the last year.

It is just my opinion that capitalism isn‚Äôt working out very well and I think adding socialist policies into society, government and economy would be a good idea. 
For example the very capitalism USA has socialist policies like social security, and that doesn‚Äôt make it socialist. The same is for northern countries which have some capitalistic policies which doesn‚Äôt automatically make them capitalists."
