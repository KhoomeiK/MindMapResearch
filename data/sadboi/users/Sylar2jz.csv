Redanian Herbal, Mandrake Cordial, and Cherry Cordial. Buy them whenever you see them, if you can spare the coin. It'll save you from having to farm it later.

- The Wraith Decoction is a wonderful survival tool when leveling or taking on enemies significantly higher level than you. It can save you from being one-shot.

- Even if you aren't rolling a caster build, at least put the first three points in Axii. It'll let you mind control people in conversations occasionally and make life easier, not to mention giving you a decent little chunk of XP for doing so.

- As long as we're talking about signs, some enemies have mechanics that almost require you to use Yrden. Wraiths:  It forces them into a corporeal form so they can be killed. Moon Dust bombs do this too, but I didn't have one for a good chuck of the game. Giant Centipedes:  (B&W enemy) These will annoyingly pop out of the ground in quick succession, making even hitting them difficult. Yrden makes them seize up, allowing a large attack window.

- Remember: Putting points into a skill is all well and good, but it won't do anything unless you actually equip it.

- Find all the Places of Power. There are YouTube videos and maps for this. The first time you use one, it gives you an extra skill point. There's quite a few Places of Power. They really add up.

- The scavenger hunt quests for witcher gear are absolutely worth it.

- If you get the option to ask characters to go to Kaer Morhen, do it. I won't tell you why, but you want people there. Kiera Metz for example. Don't neglect her side-quest.

- Pick all the flowers. Loot all the bodies. Loot every crate and chest in every house, yard, back alley, street, hill, and vale. You often get rare and expensive crafting ingredients from simple crates or bags. Don't let guards see you taking things off the street, but if there's no guards around, you're generally free to take anything not nailed down. Enter people's homes and rob them blind. Nobody reacts. Nobody cares. No negative consequences whatsoever. You'll save literal mountains of money in crafting materials.

- Save often. The auto-save isn't the best. Most loot is RNG based and you could have gotten a badass sword or armor from something, die soon after, and that item probably won't be where you found it when you go back.

- Not necessary, but I would encourage you to start on ""Blood and Broken Bones"" (Hard) difficulty. Story & Sword (Normal) is just too easy. You can button mash light attack and faceroll anything in the game. Combat in this game is technical and requires learning when to parry, when to dodge instead, and when to attack. Normal difficulty doesn't teach you these things and you'll get your ass handed to you by some of the more tough enemies. Or inversely, some of the tough big bads in the story will be complete pushovers that you 3-4 shot.
B&BB is harder, but balanced. Things aren't too hard to kill, but the game appropriately punishes you for not parrying/dodging when you should, and punishes you for button mashing. After 5 playthroughs, that difficulty seems the most balanced to me.

- 80 p/s food is like gold. Don't sell it. Don't waste it. Food is expensive in this game and that's the best stuff.

- Speaking of food, the passive ""Gormet"" is borderline broken OP. Instead of one piece of healing food lasting 5-10 seconds, it makes that strong health regen last for 20 MINUTES. Turns one piece of food into a 20 minute buff. It makes the game VERY easy. It takes all the challenge out of combat. If you're playing on normal, it will ruin the game for you. Promise.

- Saddlebags increase your carry weight capacity even when you're not on your horse. Get some as soon as you're able.

- When you blow up a monster nest, don't forget to loot the remains of the nest itself. Usually has good stuff in it. I wasn't aware of this for a large portion of my first playthrough.

- Gwent is fun.

That's all I can think of right now. I'll edit and add more as I think of them. Have fun! Wish I could experience this game for the first time again. I envy you."

AskReddit,f3s4u7u,t3_dhnvpc,1571096988.0,"I was homeless for about a year when I was 19.  Was tossed out in the middle of winter. Slept in my car, only running the engine if I had to move, or if I needed to warm up.  When the gas ran out, I still used it for shelter until the county came and hauled it away.  It was getting into spring then, so I camped after that.  I live in Montana, so there's lots of wilderness and forest to get lost in.  I stole a 1-man tent and random supplies and camped by the Gallatin river for the remainder of the time.  I fished (not as reliable as you would think) and dumpster dived behind the grocery store.  Each night the deli would throw away 20-50 lbs of hot chicken, potatoes, etc.  If you catch it just in time, you can get a hot meal.  They watch for things like that though.  The food has to be thrown away.  God forbid anyone eat it.

Eventually it got too cold and I checked myself into the local jail, admitting to a crime I didn't actually do.  They eventually figured this out, but I got a couple days of comfort and warm food. After that, I tried to kill myself.  Got pulled off the tracks by the police and the hospital made my family come get me. They weren't happy about having to help me, but I got on my feet again.

You need to love yourself a little and move on. Staying with someone out of obligation never works out. This wound will fester and it could blow out sideways or at very least he'll continue cheating on you.

I went through this exact same situation, only roles reversed. Was with a woman for 9 years because we felt we had to because we got pregnant. It was the worst decision of my life. If we'd just been honest with each other from the start, maybe we could have had a chance at happiness living apart, co-parenting our kids. Instead it festered for a decade and ended badly.

FoodPorn,ew37loc,t1_ew36qyp,1565066897.0,"More heat. Make sure your cooking surface is up to temp and quite hot before you lay down your meat. 

One trick to help avoid the annoying situation of nearly burning the outside while the inside remains raw, is to pull your meat about an hour before you cook it. Lay it out. Let it come up closer to room temperature. Season it about 30 mins to cooking time, but don't go crazy. It'll get salty as hell if it's allowed to sit too long.

A grilltop or bbq will develop a nice crust on its own, but if you're restricted to a pan, make sure it's good and hot. Like med-high or a bit higher than that. Less if your cut of meat is thick. As it's cooking, try basting with herbed butter. It'll essentially fry the outside coat of the meat, developing a nice crust if you do it right.

The most important and in my opinion the hardest thing to learn is how each level of doneness ""feels.""  Once you have that down, you won't have to cut into your meat to check doneness, sacrificing juiciness.

Let that shit rest at least 10 minutes before you cut into it. It's more important than most people think. Pull the meat just before it's your level of ""done"" as it will continue to cook in its own heat for a few minutes.


When I first started, I didn't have the internet to fall back on, but nowadays there's some really good tutorials on YouTube. Gordon Ramsey has his own channel and he does a good steak tutorial.

Huuuuge red flags. He is likely emotionally abusive, likely leading to other types of abuse. If you're in this much trouble for missing a little work, this will eventually lead to you being beaten to a pulp because the house wasn't clean or dinner ready when he gets home, or something similar.

Girl, there are normal, healthy men out there who will (and should) react to you getting hurt with ""Baby are you ok?"" and to you being depressed with ""It'll be OK. We'll get through this together."" instead of this guy's ration of guilt, anger, and emotional abuse. If he wants someone who NEVER misses a day of work, and that's the only thing he really cares about, he wants a roommate not a wife.

Having a baby with this guy would be a catastrophic disaster. You'll be tied to him for the rest of your life. He'll likely abuse you and your child.

You're the one making statements without any foundation. ""Oh I've seen something like this on the internet before."" is not a valid argument. It's the internet. Millions of people play this game. Hundreds of thousands subscribe to this subreddit. ""I've seen this before huurrrrr"" No shit. That's HIGHLY likely. I've seen shitty, asinine trolls like you before too. I was nice to you earlier, but now you can go fuck yourself."

I'm sure this isn't a unique story in a game with a substantial player base such as this. I doubt I'm the only one who something like this happened to."
pathofexile,ettvssy,t1_ettvoj1,1563197508.0,I appreciate it! However I don't think I play enough to land one. I usually hit lvl 85 or so and hit red maps before losing interest and rerolling.
