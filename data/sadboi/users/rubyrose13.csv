Advice,fqahlo0,t1_fqag2d7,1589219208.0,"He said he doesn’t know. If someone you really trust violates you like that, it’s fucking confusing. He’s going to feel like he doesn’t know what the right choice is for a while because sexual assault is bad for your brain when it happens to you. 

I wanted to stay friends with my ex for a little after he basically forced me to continue having sex with him after we broke up, and it took a couple weeks for me to realize that he hurt me and I didn’t have to give him the time of day. Most importantly, I didn’t want to anymore. 

OP: It’s not your fault if you participated when you were drunk and half awake. It’s also not your fault that you stayed. I would’ve been afraid of making a scene, that acknowledging it in the moment would’ve made it real instead of the bad dream it felt like. You shouldn’t talk to this person anymore and I highly recommend bringing it up with someone older that you trust that could help you take it to the police."

AmItheAsshole,f3tefog,t3_dhrtpz,1571130323.0,"YTA and I will explain why from my own perspective, 4 years in foster care. 

If you abandon your foster son, it will hurt terribly at first but maybe it won’t really bother him until the next person he’s supposed to rely on, lets him down. 

Statistically, as he gets older, the longer he goes without a permanent home, the likelihood he will find one diminishes. So he will bounce around foster homes and group homes, sleep in unfamiliar beds, regularly pack all his belongings into garbage bags and put them in the back of his social worker’s car. 

Maybe the abandonment issues you helped saddle him with will spur him to self-sabotage his relationships and his support networks. All of this while not having someone at home he feels like he can talk to, because he’s only known his foster parents for 3 months. 

Maybe he’ll develop a mental health problem or two, from what he experiences in foster care! Maybe that’ll lead to substance abuse! Maybe he’ll be part of the 90% of foster youth that never graduate from college :) 

He will remember it for way longer than you remember it. While you’re holding your new bundle of joy, he will feel so fucking alone. He will always wonder what’s wrong with him if you leave him."
