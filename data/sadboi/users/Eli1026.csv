I slept on the couch. I would sleep facing the back of the couch and put the puppy in-between me and the cushions. Puppy felt safe and comfortable. When the pup woke up and would try to climb over me to sniff and wander if wake up and take them out. It took a couple days, but potty training ended up fairly easy by this method. After i felt I could trust the dog not to pee in the house id leave it's kennel open and leave treats inside of it. So it'd associate the kennel as a good place.

sextips,fji7kt5,t3_fdl7hx,1583361944.0,Well. The way that worked best for me was a lot of lube. Start small. Use your pinky. Then slowly work your way up to the desired size. I'm assuming it's your penis? So make sure you can get at least two fingers in at the same time before going that far or there's going to be some anal tearing. I found the more sexually aroused I was the more willing my body was to accept anal penetration. There is also anal lube that helps immensely. It slightly numbs the area. I don't recommend using this to jump from pinky to penis right away. She may not feel it but the after effects are still the same and she will be in pain. Just use a little of the numbing lube as you work your way up. It takes some patience but you'll get there.

I try to use as littler as possible. I don't break out too much unless it's hormonal. I use a spf face lotiong mixed with a bit of tea tree essential oil. Sometimes I throw in witch hazel if I'm really red. But that tends to take care of it. Especially if I switch my pillow covers every week.
Dogtraining,eq3jko8,t1_eq1iyrv,1559757187.0,I did have the vet check his teeth for his yearly but she said they work actually pretty good. I have a cleaning scheduled in a month. Maybe they'll find something then. I've been thinking about adding a bit of fish oil to his food to help soften it and help with any dry skin he has.
Dogtraining,eq1bm73,t3_bwpykh,1559705408.0,"In all honesty I have the same issue. O'Malley is literally the best dog I have ever had. I got him as a farm puppy and he is now 8 years old. He looks like he has corgi in him as well as jack Russell terrier and possibly even Shepherd because of his markings. My only problem I've ever had with him is his barking. It's not incessant. It's door knocks or the buzzer when someone wants to be let into the building. Or hearing me talk while I'm in my apartment hallway and he's in the apartment behind the shut door. Even if my cell phone rings he barks. I've tried lots of things. At the moment the best I have is if I have someone coming over and they buzz I tell him to go to the ""room"" (my bedroom) and I shut him in there until my guest is settled in and he stops barking. Then I let him out. He's such an incredibly smart dog and I've taught him so much. But I just don't know how to get him to come with one warning bark or none at all."

sextips,epk71d3,t3_buwjh8,1559269032.0,When it comes to the balls my boyfriend explained that the sac itself is super stretchy. And if you play with the actual balls be somewhat gentle and try not to stretch those. I gently use my teeth on his sac and just pull back so it stretches out while using my hand on his shaft. With my other hand I use one of my knuckles to massage the area between the balls and the anus. Super sensitive and highly erotic spot for guys. When it comes to the shaft I go off and on with teeth. Depending on the intensity of intercourse I use more or less teeth. Just ask your guy and he should be able to tell you what feels good and what doesn't.
AskReddit,eo9fied,t3_bquclv,1558390169.0,"On behalf of my sisters story. She was 16yo and she constantly had a sore throat and coughed a lot to the point the throat was raw and bleeding. They repeatedly went to a clinic in our area always to be told by the doctor that it was because she smoked. She attempted to lessen her smoking and try to stop altogether but it didn't help. Fast forward a clue more visits, a new nurse did her pre exam. Told my mom and her to go to the ENT department an hour away. They did. Found out within 30 seconds of the doctor walking into the door that she had the worst case of strep throat he had ever seen and also had to have her tonsils removed immediately. Thank goodness for that nurse."
