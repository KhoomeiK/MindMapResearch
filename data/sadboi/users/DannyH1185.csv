quittingphenibut,f8h8065,t1_f8h1bm1,1574570757.0,Will it help for Phenibut withdrawals?? Like the lack of  concentration and focus ??
quittingphenibut,f81bfqv,t1_f812vrw,1574160130.0,"Well thanks man for the honest opinion.. but yeah that was obviously already in the plan. Or just get off it completely. The thing is when I first started taking it I did nothing so I didn’t think it really had any effect on me. Then after taking it a few different times all the sudden it hit my brain differently, and from there on out it was like combination between exes see a calm Amphetamine ... 
pretty obvious that I was going past the norm! I’ve just never been able to be addicted to something in a week I don’t care what it was. So to be honest at normal doses, I don’t think after a week stopping, one would typically be addicted or withdrawing. And no I’m not withdrawing and yes I am actually withdrawing with those affects I’m talking about now.But yes what are you talking about is not necessarily overdosing but taking a dose that is over the recommended amount. Which many take for recreational reasons, and I was taking because it gave me the feeling of MDMA. And I was able to stay up all night and go to class next day and function and do homework and I before function in class and do homework the next day and then go to sleep."

Like does 10g/day for a couple days.. then down 2g every couple days until I’m down until I’m down to maybe 3-4??? 
Then maybe 500mg s day until off.. or close to off... then even for a couple/few days?

Also I do have Selank, etizolam, and Phenazepam to substitute for some of the anxiety...

But keep in mind I HAVE TO GOTO SCHOOL ALL WEEK... Monday-Thursday,.. and I have tests and homework and projects... especially NOW that school is in its last 5 weeks...

It’s weird because when I first started using I was HYPER focused on ANYTHING and everything... then I went to scattered brained.. now to when I don’t use or use less.. I can hardly focus at all... I do have armodafinil and caffeine and other nootropics to help me with school until I can focus normally again... especially like noopept... but idk how anything will work like the Phenibut did at first... but now it doesn’t matter if I take a lot a middle or a little... it’s all unfocused..."

But seriously they wouldn’t bother with that unless u order 10,000 pills worth (which I’m sure you didn’t)  and they ‘could’ (still wouldn’t because it’s not illegal here and they wouldn’t bug a package on an arrest/trial on something ud probably win.. as it’s not possibly even an analog to any illegal drug (therefore making an import of say ex) Amphetamine-analogs.. you could get technically in some trouble if they wanted to go there whole not illegal drug, but similar (analog).. but Phenibut is only an analog of GABA , a natural substance found in your brain, not any drug... so no b illegal or even similar to analog.. also they just wouldn’t waste time on personal Phenibut orders for bugging and shit..

Either way, this substance, whichever the case of better Dr. chemists or higher quality ingredients or better reactions and methods for formation of the resulting product.., 

My experience is EXTREMELY different from yours lol... it’s probably not that you are a ‘non-reactor’ to those drug/molecule either just because it’s more like an actual natural molecule GABA, then most other substances/drugs and how they way of causing psychoactive effects..

I have had, either low dose strong effects (just read others’ reports that are most extreme on these) or strong effects from large doses, to my own extreme, including: lighter... and extreme, and why I used this dosage and when I would have these continued use(s) again (as much as feeling, literally like I was on the BEST MDMA I had ever used, also being easily able to stay up, very EASILY [somehow differently than actual straight stimulates, as after the 2-4 day make ur usually tweaked acting/feeling/looking, but on Phenibut always looked, mostly felt, and acted calm and normal])...

Loved them both but do not recommend the latter... just I don’t recommend anything of that nature to anyone but myself, as I shouldn’t want to tempt anyone else to experience health effects...

So, yes either you are either doing it wrong (dosage, eating-wise as I agree with other comments of eating and effectiveness, or you’re getting the wrong stuff and/or doing something wrong? Idc what...

So the whole thing was aired in voice text inability to understand what people are saying or spell certain words so or replace her words with others.

So hopefully the majority of the beginning is clear. If you have questions about it or the latter part I’m sorry I could not fix it and that’s why it’s all weird sounding or maybe it is I don’t know. Go ahead and ask me I good luck buddy."
benzodiazepines,f30cxsr,t1_f307lul,1570551645.0,"Umm yes... My doctor took me off of diazepam 30 mg a day for six years. So I replaced it with Phenazepam...2.5 mg a day and to be honest it actually works better. Please do not use my experience as a reference.. I would not want someone else to be injured or do something stupid on my advice. 

Oh and by the way I use the Phenazepam from a Russian pharmacy so it is actual prescription made,  and it is in tablet form either 2.5 mg or 2 mg and so is the dosed properly and made properly...

I do not get it from an RC vendor and I would never ever use Phenazepam from that form, as if in that form.. because it’s too dangerous and that’s where you hear all the horror stories from. I

In reality phenazepam is much more of an overall anxiolytic then diazepam. But that is only if you’re using it for ‘medicinal purposes’ not recreation. Because diazepam is more of a sense of well-being and it is a strong anxiolytic and in more of a form of euphoria, but really I wouldn’t qualify any Benzos ad euphoric. 

But it is better in the form of diazepam is probably one of the best US ones that is prescribed, there are a few other ones I’ve researched..!that I cannot remember the name of ... especially one of the top of my head but it has a longer half-life than diazepam and it is more Antianxiety affect and it has less sedation and amnesic affect, as well as very anxiolytic..

So I found out about it after my doctor stop prescribing me diazepam. So I never mentioned it to her because I do not tell her that I’ve taken Phenazepam, obviously. 

But the whole idea is that things like Xanax do you not have long half lives...?and Klonopin Bynes in someway that’s weird to the GABA receptors where it’s just does something they don’t know and it causes more long-term damage and also addiction and withdrawal effects. So says my psychiatrist and she’s very smart and then I read about it and I’ve heard similar things. That honestly makes them worse more and see you with a more abusive nature, Ect,, overall antianxiety carelessness but if you’re looking for like a long term benzo those are  good and things that I have a long half life far. So that’s why Diazepam was so much better it was actually pretty good and I really want off of it basically cold turkey and ham in my underwear drawers for like two weeks but they were anything severe like you hear about benzo‘s and it’s because it has a long half life so it is built up in your system more therefore it leaves your system a lot slower so the with drawl symptoms are worse of the year and less dangerous in the form of causing seizures and things like that and also instead of having like a week of horrid withdrawal you have like two weeks of minor withdrawal. I could suck butt I live so I get it wasn’t the end of the world. Therefore I think the Nazarene was better in that form also I wonder why they don’t prescribe the other benzodiazepine I read about that is superior to diazepam I’ve never heard of it until I looked into benzos on Wikipedia and there’s nothing but good things about it like it’s not used for sleep or things that benzos would be prescribed for that are not related to anxiety even though they do calls into anxiety affect like triazolam and many others. To be honest Ativan and Klonopin are horrible medication Xanax Xanax is even better than those in the form that it’s less dangerous and diazepam is far superior that you don’t see the prescribed anymore I had specifically asked for it for a very very kind psychologist you knew a psychiatrist and talk to me into prodding me an hour and then I just they just keep y’all.

Anyways for tofis it is not nearly as Anzio is this typical benzos but it does work I’m not sure how well because I don’t use it for that early but it is a potentiator certain benzos late as a Pam they don’t use in the US of course. I do not know how it would work as a daily dose if you were just using that for antianxiety. Or use it probably twice a month and I only take one pill which is 50 mg or two at the most which is 100 mg which is not very much when it comes to that and I know it can be dangerous when you take it with other benzo‘s but bad so if it’s not known to be very addictive so I don’t really know you’ll have to research it. That’s all I can help you with about though hope I hope some rain good luck."

Everything Else I get from there, which is a lot, is of pretty good quality as far as I can tell. I’m sure it’s not that it’s not bad phenibut, I’m sure that it’s really phenibut... It’s just something different.. Maybe in the process If you use different starting substances or chemical reactions to reach the same and molecule. Many times the same exact molecule will have different effects, not completely bought enough where it was better than the other... I couldn’t tell y’all what it is if it’s this or if it’s just the same molecule but a different version it could be many things I don’t know because I’m not testing it in the extreme way...
The same molecule, just either it’s mirror image or its mirror image cut in half and they use one side of the molecule rather than the other...
This is how they get and use mostly D-Amphetamine (DextroAmphetamine) which you typically find in the tablets which is the immediate release and do you get more of the euphoria and focus. Then the things like the XR Amphetamine and now mostly Vyvanse (D- and L- Amphetamine, they use four kinds, two d-amphetamines and 2 l-amphetamines.. they all metabolized differently and at different rates some faster some slower, then the D Amphetamine vs the L Amphetamine, also the L- Amphetamine is known for being far less euphoric, but more focus oriented)...
Also, S- Citalopram [EsCitalopram] (Lexapro, SSRI Antidepressant) instead of S- and R- Citalopram (Celexa, SSRI Antidepressant)...
Lexapro is literally just the Celexa molecule, which has two sides mirror-imaged, they cut it in half, took the S- Citalopram side and made Lexapro... supposedly by doing this they took the half of the molecule that was causing most of the side effects from both S & R molecule, which is Celexa. Also they were able to give a higher dose of just the S- version, rather than both S and R version.. 20 mg of Lexapro equals about 80 mg of Celexa..."

Phenibut I bought from a USA Nootropic Vendor (VERY reputable, and other products work too high effect... it is one of the most, if not the most known and highly rated ‘Depot’ for Nootropic ;] )

Phenibut I bought from a well known Russian Pharma Site... Where it is prescribed, so actually Pharmaceutical  Scientists create/make then monitor or whatever... it’s in actual Pharmaceutical Company boxes with tablet pills.. Rather than capsules filled with powder created by ??? (Though it is ‘phenibut’ and I know they are creating actual real phenibut)...

Idk what it is... whether it be different steps used in the creation of the end product (as you can use different substances as starting agents, other agents used in the chemical processes of changing these agents as necessary to continue creating next step substances, as well as methods of turning these substances into Phenibut)...

But the Phenibut from Russia, that is what they make and distribute to prescribed patients in their pharmacies, is farrrr superior to the USA Nootropic vendor I have gotten from...

RU Pharma grade make me feel less sedation... more confident... happier and feel euphoria... I literally feel like I am on the best MDMA I’ve ever had, it actually is much better euphoria, sense of bliss, and clean wonderful energy... I can stay up for 4 days and 3 nights with literally ZERO sleep and function completely normal.. like what the F***?? How is that possible lol.., Though I do consciously consistently drink a lot of water/high quality green tea, eat consistently as well (only healthy food such as salmon/tuna/different nuts/avocado and olive oils with everything I can, a lot of eggs, and lower amounts of carbohydrate containing foods, though NO sugar carbohydrates and only healthy whole grain complex carbs)... thus not too much food not too little.. constantly aware that I need to be conscious of my need to be continually drinking water (or ill be in the zone and will not drink anything and hours will pass without me even realizing it)... so these foods have high healthy Fats (tons of omegas, especially omega 3), Choline (mostly from the eggs, but I eat 4 eggs usually twice in each of those 24 hour periods), and then they have different and high quality proteins and much fiber.. and vegetables and then a high quality multivitamin at differing times opposite when I am eating foods with natural vitamins...

dxm,f2m0824,t3_ddmpv5,1570300069.0,"You guys are right =}

It is safest to take products that only contain DXM. A large portion of OTC products contain an analgesic (e.g. Acetaminophen), a decongestant (e.g. phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), an antihistamine (e.g. chlorpheniramine, brompheniramine, pheniramine), and/or the expectorant guaifenesin.


In over-the-counter formulations, DXM is often combined with acetaminophen (paracetamol, APAP) to relieve pain and to prevent recreational use;[2] however, to achieve DXM's dissociative effects, the maximum daily therapeutic dose of 4000 mg of APAP is often exceeded, potentially causing acute or chronic liver failure, making abuse and subsequent tolerance of products which contain both DXM and APAP potentially fatal.

Recreational use of DXM is sometimes referred to in slang form as ""robo-tripping"", whose prefix derives from the Robitussin brand name, or ""Triple Cs"", which derives from the Coricidin brand. (The pills were printed with ""CCC"" for ""Coricidin Cough and Cold"".) However, this brand presents a danger when used at recreational doses due to the presence of chlorpheniramine.

phenibut,f2g73i8,t3_dd7o66,1570227221.0,"Yes... either if I used too much (usually around 2g at once and in more than more than once per day) and also when I used multiple days in a row (using in this same manner), and then if I used in this way for multiple days AND I would not sleep for 1-2 nights (either literally zero hours of sleep, or maybe 30min-1/2hr and this was because I passed out in a weird way. Like I would fall asleep uncomfortably, like a weird nod off that would eventually lead to a short sleep)...

And I would not recommend doing either of the two later types of use mentioned, heh, for obvious reasons... This would happen either because I could not sleep due to it’s stimulating nature at these doses (for me) or because I purposely used it for this because I enjoyed the staying up and because I would need to continue staying up because of my need to continue studying or return to class in the morning, and I knew, since I used it for these enjoyment purposes, I would need to stay awake (because I would find myself not waking up to my loud alarm going off for 2-4 hours at non-stop 8 minute intervals.. =} and ;/  )

Also, only when using these high amounts and using multiple times per day... I would find myself also having these weird nod off like effects where I would either continue nodding off uncontrollably, but never falling completely asleep... and that I would have these same nod issues usually while I was doing something standing up (never happened to me before, and I’ve both, NEVER used opioids before and HAVE used benzodiazepines and alcohol at very high levels, both individually and together)... 
It was also strange because I would nod off to a state of unconsciousness for either a slight few seconds or sometimes for a couple/few minutes, and when I’d awaken i would be completely unaware that this state was coming on, which scared me mostly after waking up after the 1-3mins episodes and also that I would think things like ‘what the F just happened’ and even weirder that I was doing things in this state (drug-sleep walking?¿), and one time awoke to eating my either cooked sweet-potatoes that were still in the cooking pot over the sink, and then I nodded unconscious again and awoke a minute or two later somehow with my wall calendar both off my wall and on my counter that was wet but not soaked (it was in the sink obviously, so connecting the dots I had taken it off my wall and put it in my sink while I was eating my sweet potatoes over it), but then when I woke to conscious state and I was done both with eating sweet potatoes [was unconscious eating them and conscious when I started, so it was like they magically disappeared by me eating them, as my mind registered it]  I had a piece of paper that was from my calendar, in the sink and now on my counter drying, that I had in my mouth and was chewing it as if eating it! Who knows if I ate more and if I actually swallowed any of it because I was unconscious starting all this and woke to not knowing/remembering doing these things and then the paper in my mouth and chewing. I woke like wtf am I doing? Then spitting it out, wondering if I had swallowed any, then realized what I had done both moving the calendar and finishing the sweet potatoes...

So yeah... I enjoy it and am both like wtf by it causing these weird nods and weird things being done while unconscious... these unconscious or nod offs never happened if I was outside my apartment, in public settings, or around people I think it is worth mentioning,.. I’m guessing my mind knew I couldn’t have them happen and because I was in environments where social aspect was around??

Hope this helped and educated on what could happen if you ever induced in these practices =}

You should really NEVER need anywhere even close to this amount though..
As I used it daily for awhile and never built much of a tolerance... I used quite high amounts as well, around 600mg sometimes then sometimes around 1500mg... Although this was in one night of tripping and it was in one ‘session’ (without ending my intoxicated mind-state), it was NEVER in a SINGLE DOSE... typically, I would only ever either take 500-600mg in either a total one dose or in particular one-night sessions... sometimes 300-400mg to start and then an additional 2nd dose either 200-300mg, either an hour or two after the 1st dose had kicked in or metabolized enough to ingest another ...other times taking no more than 400mg-600mg as a first dose, then usually 200-400mg at intervening doses throughout the day/night (session) until I would reach total doses of 800-1500mg. And when I reached those higher amounts in a trip, not taking them at 1-2 hour intervals, but taking the additional doses (however many dose(s) that time) after the previous dose(s) were almost to be completely metabolized and the trip would have started ending (usually around 4-6 hours later)...

Happy tripping!¡ Be safe and remember that personally I had the best trips and experiences with DXM!¡ =} Both in overall enjoyment, feelings, experiences, it’s non-addictive manner, and profound experiences and knowledge (knowledge and understandings that still stick with me to this day [believe it can.. or that it will happen, if you have the correct dose amounts and separated in correct intervals] and mostly that both this your purpose or reasons of DXM use, and not the escape of your reality or pure enjoyment (which is awesome too! And it was my own purpose when I first started it’s use for these reasons. Though that changed to using for these more meaningful and purposeful uses when my life reasons/purpose changed =} )...

Either way those 2 reasons both are great with DXM.. whichever your purpose is yours and that’s awesome as well)..

I get it, addiction.. yah yah I got it to, not to nicotine, but other little annoyances :/

Either way may weekly and I’m 33 went back to school a year ago end of this semester...

Armodafinil - 1 x day 150mg
Pramiracetam - 2-3 x day 300mg doses
Oxiracetam - 1-2 x day 800mg doses
Phenylpiracetam - ‘as needed’ 100/200mg
Coffee - ‘as needed’, but not much (last choice)

Now I barely ever take Phenylpiracetam. By as needed I mean like 1-3 x a month...

And the other 3 I take daily, however I do not take any of them Friday/Saturday/Sunday (as I’m not in classes)

Also, Oxiracetam is a stack with my Pramiracetam, and it is kind of ‘as needed’ as well... Pramiracetam is everyday like a vitamin, Oxiracetam is like what an adderall would be... so if I’m about to do some homework I’ll take one with my Pramiracetam (which is just scheduled).. that’s why it’s 0-2 x day, if I don’t have Studying or schoolwork, I don’t take.. or if I only need 3hrs schoolwork, I may just take one. I’m not gonna just take it to ‘build up’ in my system, as I use Pramiracetam as both a ‘build up’ and a direct/immediate effector..

I’m looking into many others, and I’ve tried many others... but it can be overwhelming lol.. like ALL of them you’ll find yourself needing or something that would be beneficial heh.. at least that’s how I am, of course I don’t indulge as I know it would actually be harmful

Just get rid of it ... 
I mean if that’s what u want, honestly that’s the ONE GOOD THING that differs from kratom to opioids, it can easily be cold turkeied... yes, it will suck and be depressing and some physical symptoms as well (depending on how long uve been on it).

I’ll tell u one thing.. 2 separate times of me getting off, cold turkey... 1 time I had a 4 week break in between classes. The withdrawals were way worse (or so I told myself)... a second time I was needing to stop (and I f***ing flushed 500$ worth of good quality down the bath tub, because I knnnneeeewww, if I had it, I’d do it... no questions asked...) and I stopped on a Wednesday (we were having massively long snow days from college last winter and I was either gonna just miss classes Thursday and Friday, because classes already got canceled Wednesday from a Tuesday night text [hence when I decided to take the opportunity to quit]... and then d have the weekend , so Wednesday-Sunday and go back Monday.... so 5 days full clean, 6th day back to normal full on life... and luckily classes got canceled even that Thursday and Friday lol so I didn’t end up missing any class.. but I was fine going back to school..
And both time I was equally addicted...
Moral of the story is, if I had to be off at a certain point, or If I could baby myself on a 3 week break, determined the majority (past day 1, maybe 2-3) of my ‘pain and suffering’ mentally... I swear I was in HELL those 3 weeks off school relaxing in my apartment watching movies nothing I HAD to get done.. but come worrying about school, hmwk, not knowing I was getting those off as snow days and thinking I was just gonna have to make up the work... I suddenly felt ‘not so bad’...

Only thing was the same, having to get rid of the shit from my ability to use.. and day 1-3...

Good luck I honestly mean it!!! It can be depressing but hopefully you have a girlfriend or boyfriend (whichever) around.. I didn’t have shit, no one.. You’ll be A’OKAY just as soon as you decide you are ;}>~
