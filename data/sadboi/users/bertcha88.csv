AskReddit,foy9q4j,t3_ga4gjx,1588168415.0,"This happened when I was about 7 or 8. I was napping on my moms bed when I started to have on of those “not quite awake but not quite asleep” type hallucinations. 

I looked around and the bed was surrounded by what looked like tv static. I started feeling like the bed was spinning so I held on for dear life. I then looked up and saw a crack in the static with 3 sets of glowing eyes staring at me. I swear as soon as I made eye contact a voice said. “She’s awake, let’s get out of here.” And then I woke up, still clutching the bed.

I had almost forgotten about this until years later, when watching a documentary about people claiming to have been abducted by aliens that a lady told a very similar story to my dream while describing her experience. It’s was likely just a vivid lucid dream in my case, but it’s still weird."

The bride and groom had plans to drive to their honeymoon a couple states away the morning after the wedding. Apparently the groom decided at the last second after agreeing that they’d take HIS car that he didn’t feel like driving anymore. This led to the bride getting angry, the groom storming out and the bride bawling at the table while all of the guests sat in awkward silence. 

However, the wedding went on the next day, and the honeymoon as far as I know. No idea who ended up driving.

They divorced 7 years later, which is longer than anyone thought it would last."
