Frugal,fqosdv1,t3_gjqx6q,1589523448.0,I craft a lot of my own artwork. And let me tell you I aint no artist. Check out Pinterest for some ideas that you can do using stuff you’ve found laying around or from the Dollar Tree. A lot of people have craft stuff laying around that they just don’t want. If you find yourself really good at something trade it off with someone else. I sew stuff for my friend who paints stuff for me for example. My mom gets together weekly (not recently obviously) with a group of friends/cousins and they do a new craft together until it’s done. They learned how to quilt and were doing knitting right before covid hit. I’m also a big fan of quotes and just like lettering type art which is super easy to print out on regular printer paper and stick in cheap frames and super easy to switch out depending on your mood or the season or whatever.

I thought I was eligible for some money from welfare but apparently because I was on a medical deferral which made me exempt from having to look for work I’m not eligible because I found this job on my own without their help. I don’t really think that’s fair so I called my worker to see if she could look into that. There’s another place I could ask but it would take about a week to process and I’m just trying to see if there’s anything I could do in the meantime. My mom usually would be my help but she’s currently out of a job and in the middle of a big move to a cheaper place. I asked my dad for help but he hasn’t answered and I don’t have much hope because he’s perpetually broke and has been more or less out of my life for my entire life, despite my trying to build a relationship.

I used to have this colour in my 20’s and the only reason I was able to upkeep it was because I worked in a salon and was able to touch it up every couple of weeks.
