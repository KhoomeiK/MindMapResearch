As for my brows, noted! I wanna play around with different brow types. I’ve always liked bold filled in brows on people but I could try to soften mine and see if I prefer it!"

prettyaltgirls,fqc4lff,t1_fqbzml6,1589250003.0,Preach. “She’s not like other girls” always feels like such a weird “compliment”. I feel uncomfortable when people say it even though they mean well.

Wait why was I downvoted I’m genuinely confused?? This really is my daily look ): you can see it repeated in the photos I’ve posted to reddit! Should I not do this for my daily? I’ve grown to love this look!"

Here’s what I use. Very cost effective.


NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP Mechanical Eye Pencil, White https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G9E98O/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_2xGUEbHX7K206

So it is gonna feel uncomfortable at first you but directly line your waterline with the liner. Liquid wouldn’t work because it would just dissipate into your eye. I’ve tried so many white liners but threw all of them away when I found this one. It lasts all day and is cheap as heck!"

prettyaltgirls,fqbhfh2,t1_fqbgcpz,1589237038.0,Thank you! I’m wondering what makes me different though?? I do a full face of makeup most days but go natural others. I guess I have unique features? Idk. I always thought I had a weird face but I’ve been told time after time that just because my face is unlike classic conventional beauty doesn’t mean I am ugly.

Got some expensive gastro appointments coming up soon, so anything would be super kind! I’ve been a balloon for a few weeks now. I just want to not be sick! What’s awesome is finally having health insurance after years without it so I’m super pumped to be able to see doctors, yipeeee!!!"
