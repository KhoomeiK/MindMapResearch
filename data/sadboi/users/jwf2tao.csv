StackAdvice,fp3okgk,t3_fisgbr,1588282980.0,"During my scrip years I was primarily on various mixes of lithium carb, lamotrogine and Laguna. Still taking lithium but switched to the non scrip orotate form- it’s organic and doesn’t have a high risk of lithium poisoning. Otherwise the adaptogens seem to be working.
Why I miss is the feel good buzz I got from narco pain pills, but that doesn’t seem likely in today’s world. Have read about micro dosing, but the level of effort to grow shrooms is beyond me right now. We’ll see. Cheers."
StackAdvice,fklxl7j,t3_fisgbr,1584316792.0,"Sounds like we have traversed more than a few of the same paths. I’m bipolar 20 yrs went on the pain pill path with a hip replacement, coming off that my anxiety went bonkers. Can’t do the benzodiazepines so I have played with nootropics and adaptogens...some success.. Sticking with, for now...Rhodiola by Gaia, bacopa by Toniq, ashwagandha, lithium orotate, cognizant, some reg nutritional stuff. NO scrips...it’s been a long time, study, work, perseverance. You just have to commit yourself. And I can’t even tell you it’s worth it at the end of the day"
StackAdvice,fjok3d2,t3_f3dgkb,1583529345.0,"Yeah microdosing for adaptogens gives me no benefits, but that seems to be the case for all drugs or supplements. Perhaps too many years of abuse?! I would like to try micro psyllicybin, but not sure how to score...!?"
StackAdvice,fhilpnt,t3_f3dgkb,1581627196.0,Tried but didn’t get the benefits of larger dose. Sometimes I take a full days dose of Rhodiola in AM because it seems to effect sleep if I take it PM. I struggle with sleep patterns so I sometimes use GABA powder and drink valerian tea. I find this path is a rocky road and you have to constantly play with it!
StackAdvice,fhigz12,t3_f3dgkb,1581624558.0,"I’m bipolar and have been actively pursuing minimizing my scrip meds by using nootropics. Have experimented quite a bit but have found for me adaptogens offer the best balance of benefits. I’m probably attempting to treat a broader range of symptoms than you, but what has worked for me is Rhodiola by Gaia, Bacopa by Himalaya, Ashwaganda by nutriflair. Recommended doses. I also take some stuff I believe is synergistic- Gingko, Alpha GPC, Sacred 7 mushrooms by Naturealm; plus some “regular” nutritional supplements.
I’m very stable right now, but for long term support I’m looking for a Naturopathic MD that has experience with these sorts of issues...a frustrating search so far. But I think it might be wise to have an experienced guide as I progress down this path. Ciao."

Nootropics,ezpyq5w,t1_ezp1q8z,1568051565.0,"I’m 65 with long term bipolar and HCV. Have just finished Harvoni treatment for HCV, so theoretically the virus has been eradicated from my liver AND my brain. I can only assume that having the virus active in my brain for 30+ years has disrupted various functions. Basically no research has been done in this area, but I feel like the nootropics I take are providing a healing effect. So I’m all in, at least for 3-4 months to assess the mental effects of HCV treatment. If I reach a place where I feel comfortable adjusting my psycho meds, then I’ll review. Ultimately I’d like to get off the scrips and OTC...see what it’s like to be clean and pure!"
