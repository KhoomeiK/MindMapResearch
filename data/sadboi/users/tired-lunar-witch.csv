leaves,fn2i8i8,t3_fyytva,1586589959.0,"Personally I started by cutting all ties with my dealers, deleted their snapchat and everything. Second of all, after one last night out with the boys, I just stopped. Stopped buying, stopped smoking, threw everything down the toilet and didn't look back. You have to force yourself at first because you WILL miss it. I still do. But you gotta be stronger than that. It can be tough and you might have relapses, I did, but don't abandon anyway : one relaps is okay, the most important thing is to keep going, and not become a regular smoker again. It gets easier with time : the tougher parts are the first few weeks. Afterward you LIVE again like a real human and it feels great."

I started smoking pot in great quantity because of my anxiety, depression, and also I suspect that I'm an undiagnosed Aspergirl (I'm about to get diagnosed soon) so I fully understand why you started, and also why you decided to quit. I'm on day 3 without weed, so if you need some support or just a chitchat, I'm here! You made a great decision to stop. Being sober honestly feels good too. Good luck!"

I literally spent the best day of my life yesterday, and it's a nice change from the depression. Right now I feel in the afterglow of it kinda ; when it will ready drop down I know I'll be tired and hungry and upset, but at least now I have a memory of a happy moment to hold on to. I'm feeling good, no worries ; I know it was risky, but I'm good and it was a one time thing anyways. The only thing I'll keep taking will probably be weed ; don't want to become addicted to coke or anything. Thanks for the infos though, it's good to know. I didn't know the term ""SSRI"" you kinda lost me there not gonna lie lmao"
Drugs,f9xayay,t1_f9xa2wd,1575708033.0,"Tbh I have no idea what you're talking about, these drugs don't have the same names in my country (English isn't my first language) but if you wanna know i take 20mg of fluoxetine (which is essentially serotonin for my body to take since I can't produce it in my brain) 5mg of aripiprazole (a neuroleptic) and 200 mg of Tegretol  (a mood regulator which I hadn't taken in over 24h). I looked up what SSRIs are and no, I don't take them."

Drugs,f9x9j6a,t1_f9x8kz4,1575707239.0,"Honestly i have 3 very small doses of serotonin, neuroleptics and the last pill, with the highest dosage, I hadn't taken it in over 24h. The 2 first pills, I had taken them at 7am so I was good, it was almost over already.
For the mix, tbh I didn't really think much of it, because once again I took everything in small doses. I only took one half of ecstasy, which almost didn't have any effect on me ; at some point I started to feel a little hot and I really wanted a hug but that's it. I took 1 line of coke, a tiny one, and waited for about 4 to 5 hours before taking the speed (1 small line too). Tbh I essentially did it to wake up a little bit. I'm very tall and resistant to mostly everything (alcohol, drugs, meds, really) so I knew I was safe with the smaller doses.
I am a bit suicidal, but I'd never do anything that could potentially kill me. I thought it through a little bit and I trusted my guts with it, and I guess it worked since I'm still here yay"

When you put effort in your appearance, you feel better about yourself, even if just a little. Taking care of yourself never hurts."
SuicideWatch,f6lcjq8,t1_f6izfi7,1572937780.0,"Idk I just don't feel anything other than the absolute want to disappear. I was bullied in two different schools, then raped, then my best friend killed herself, then some friends in my high school died in a bus accident. And somewhere along the way I found myself not feeling anything anymore. There's nothing I want, nothing I like to do, nothing. The only thing that kept me from killing myself until now was that I didn't want my family and friends to be sad. But even that doesn't work anymore, it seems.

I feel like I have to get my shit together because it's been almost 10 years of depression and if I can't heal in ten years, does that mean I have to feel like this for another 2, 5 or 10 years? I can't. If I'm not better by now I'll never be. There's also the fact that I thought I'd never live past that age, so I never really planned to have a life. And I'm so lost : there's nothing I want to study or work on, I don't know what to do with myself. If I don't find at least one idea by January, I won't be able to handle it."

Life already won. I'm already dead inside. I have no idea what to do, and everytime I try to think about my own life I start crying and having a panic attack... I'm just really tired."

I feel empty, most days, and the emptiness hurts me. It takes all my strength and all I can do about it is lay in bed and cry.

When I was around 14 I think, I started to realize that I didn't want to live past 20. I don't really know why twenty ; maybe because it feels like an important age in someone's life, you are supposed to get your shit together, study to have the job of your dreams, and I didn't want any of that. Still don't want it. It accidentally became my date."
