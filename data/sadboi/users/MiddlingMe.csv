relationship_advice,fnft73h,t3_g1d4ny,1586914952.0,"I can tell you from personal experience that a guy who is good at going down on you is worth so much more than a guy with an above average penis. For starters, most women cannot orgasm from vaginal sex, and a lot of guys get their idea of sex from porn and thus think that women can easily orgasm if his dick is a certain size. Rubbish. Our clits are on the outside. If that is not stimulated most of us struggle to orgasm.  Period.  We don't have much sensation inside the vagina. 

A guy who takes the time to learn our bodies and what makes us tick is a treasure. My husband has been getting better at going down on me over the years, and he is always working on how he can please me better, and quite frankly his technique is now phenomenal.  He doesn't have a small penis yet I get far more pleasure from him going down on me than I do from penetration.  Penetration is fun for bonding and all of that, but him going down on me is what actually will make me orgasm. 

In fact, I call him the Master of Tongue (inside joke for us haha).  

Plus, nothing is sexier than a man who knows his way around your vagina and who isn't afraid to explore. 

Remember that men are the ones who create and direct porn for the most part, so what you see in porn is what men imagine women want, not what women actually want. 

I hope this helps! Please don't feel bad about yourself.  It's all in how you do it, and from what it sounds like, you are pleasing her just fine. :)"

AmItheAsshole,fmulnys,t3_fxbnct,1586393839.0,"YTA.  This is horrible and I feel so sad for Twin B. I promise you that Twin A is already going to be rewarded more in life for having his personality. He will be more popular, have an easier time dating, be more liked by employers and probably make more money, etc. Just for being himself. Introverts and reserved/shy people are always overlooked and undervalued, which is unfortunate but a reality of life, but how cruel to force this reality on him by his own *parents*.  Your parents are supposed to be the one set of people who are on your side and who appreciate you for who you are as an individual. I could only imagine what it feels like to be seen this way by your own parents at such an insecure age.  

Personality traits like extroversion are pretty ingrained in us, and aren't exactly something we have much control over. Just answer me this question. If one twin was more attractive than the other (another trait that can't really be helped), would you pay them more in allowance for it? 

This post is just so sad to read. :( And the fact that both you and your spouse agreed to this, and neither one of you saw this as cruel is just.....heartbreaking. 

Poor kid. I wish I could give him a hug. If my reserved husband and I had a kid like that, we would treasure him.  He deserves so much better than this, and I think you know this deep down. 

If you are actually open to understanding Twin B better, I highly suggest the book"" Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking "" by Susan Cain. It is incredible book that I think would help you understand your son better and perhaps help you and your spouse develop a stronger relationship with him. 

Good luck."

Being frugal involves buying something of high quality that you won't need to replace for a very long time, whereas being cheap is spending as little as possible in the moment which often leads to buying things of poor quality that will need to be replaced much sooner and far more often. Being cheap usually *costs* people a lot of money in the end, which is why poor people often spend more money on things in the long run. Because they can't afford the ultimately less expensive option in the moment, so they buy whatever their money can give them, which will need to be replaced far sooner, costing them more money in the long term.

What I worry about is that I am a petite woman. I am 5'3, 115 lbs, and limited in reach or strength. One thing I absolutely fear is being a burden on the rest of the people I would be working with. For example. I imagine a scenario where I would need to help hold something up/carry stuff, and I imagine myself making the work for the others harder. And then I would worry about that breeding resentment among my coworkers, who might be thinking how much easier it would be for them if my position were filled by a man instead.

What are your thoughts on that? Would that be an understandable concern in your mind, or am I just over thinking it?"
relationships,fiyom1b,t1_fiy7da4,1582843549.0,"Yeah, I couldn't live this way.  I highly value my independence.  

When my husband and I (we are both now 30) were in our early twenties, we moved into our first apartment off campus in the college town we lived in.  We lived about an hour away from his parents, and his mom would tell him to bring over all of our laundry every time we visited, would refuse to allow us to do our own laundry there, and would give us SO much food to take back, along with a lot of, quite frankly, useless stuff we didn't need. 

I grew up very independent, and I hated this. I eventually broke down and told him I refuse to bring over any more laundry.  She would still insist and harass him to just bring it over.  I finally put my foot down and said no.  I wanted to be an adult. And honestly, it was unattractive to see my partner being taken care of by his mother at that point. I wanted us to be adults taking care of ourselves.  I felt that his mom's ""kindness"" was really just a way to feel useful, but in my opinion it is selfish to limit the growth of your own child just so that you can feel useful and appreciated. 

If somebody is doing something ""kind"" that you ask them not to do, it stops being an act of kindness, and it is at that point that you realize that they aren't really doing this for you, but for themselves. When somebody insists  that they don't want me to do something for them, I immediately stop doing it because I have respect for them. 

It took time but she finally listened and stopped doing these things by the time we were in our mid twenties. There is no way I could handle this in our late 20s or later. 

For you this is trickier because you don't live far away.  I think the first step is to get that key from them, and perhaps even insist on moving. They don't have a right to YOUR home. That is way too invasive and unhealthy. Your situation sounds suffocating and I wouldn't have the patience for it.  You aren't being ungrateful by wanting to set boundaries.  Does your husband ever plan on growing up? What about if you two have kids? Is he just going to be an absent father who has his mother doing all of the child rearing when you aren't around? Is she going to steal all of the important moments you want to have with your own kids? 

This isn't looking good, kids or no kids.  Put your foot down.  You deserve respect. You aren't a child, and you deserve better than to be treated as one.  If his parents TRULY care, and do these things out of the goodness of their own hearts, they would understand and immediately stop.  You don't need to martyr yourself for this family.  The bird needs to fly out of the nest at some point.  Let's just say I would have already flown out of that nest long ago. Good luck."

This guy SUCKS. That wasn't loving and don't allow yourself to be treated so horribly by your partner. You are far younger than you realize. If I were you I would go find a new man. This one is a dud."

neoliberal,fffb5f7,t3_etafip,1579880080.0,"Hey, he still owes me money for my participation in the Women's March. According to my conservative brother, everybody there was paid by Soros, so where's my check, cheapskate?"
Maher,fff7ui2,t1_fff4zwx,1579877899.0,"The thing is I think he hates being President. But he likes the popularity. So what he'll do is leave office complaining that he should have won, start his Trump TV ""news"" channel or YouTube channel, and constantly make himself the victim.

That's the only reason why I think Maher is wrong about this. He really overestimates how much Trump likes being President. He loves his rallies, which he can do more of when not President. Maybe one of his kids would want to run in 2024 and he'll back them. But I think Trump didn't expect to actually win, but was just trying to build his brand. He looked crushed when he had found out he had won. 

Otherwise, yes, I could see what Maher is saying."

neoliberal,ff9gasc,t1_ff9dyyd,1579712393.0,"Oh yes, I am 100% voting for Bernie in the election if he wins the nomination, and I will more importantly be voting down ticket as well.  I want more of a balance on the Supreme Court. 

But yes, those examples you gave are exactly why I am hesitant to just stubbornly decide that the only way is M4A. Nuance is important, and I respect anybody who uses it."

neoliberal,ff9bzws,t1_ff90ez9,1579709510.0,It might be a way for her to secure her spot as a permanent political pundit on Fox News. Who knows? The possibilities are endless for this sneaky little devil.
neoliberal,ff9bgex,t1_ff81idf,1579709152.0,"Same. I also voted for Bernie. But now I'm considered a centrist or Republican because I want universal healthcare, but I'm not sure if M4A is the way. 

When did we decide on the left that it HAS to be M4A. I feel like I wasn't present for that meeting. And it feels like it came out of nowhere just within the last few years. 

I am open to any system that will provide every American access to good healthcare. How we get there isn't something I feel passionate about, because quite frankly, I'm not an expert and I don't know what political capital is necessary to get there. I also don't feel comfortable when anybody oversimplifies either a problem or it's solution. So I'm open to many different solutions. 

But I guess that makes me some sort of sell out? 

This kind of stuff has pushed me away, even to the point of resenting Bernie himself."
