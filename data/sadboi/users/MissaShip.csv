I was ok with needles for a long time after having an intense fear as a kid. I got blood work like a champ until suddenly I started throwing up midway through or immediately after. I warn anyone that needs to take my blood that it happens but they sort of just think I’m anxious. It’s like a reflex now."

I don’t work, I don’t have children, I don’t even leave my house (even before we weren’t supposed to). I really truly am pointless except for one thing that’s quickly fading. My sisters kids who live 2000 km away think I’m the coolest thing in the universe. When they grow older they will forget me too and I’ll fall back in line with the billions of forgotten. When I die I’ll be cremated and thrown in the ocean. There won’t be an urn or a headstone or a name plate on a stone. There won’t even be anything for an archaeologist to stumble on in 300 years. Trust me I know there is no point to suicide. It’s unnecessary pain to the people who watch me in my cage from afar. Unnecessary pain to the people who think they need that sense of peace in the back of their mind “melissas ok”. They don’t care that I’m as far from ok as I can get. I’m a lump of rock buried under 100 feet of dirt at the bottom of the ocean. Of no use, with no purpose. As I see it I’m taking up space. I use supplies others could use, I live in an apartment someone else needs. I’m breathing air that another baby, one that died the day I was born, could be breathing. I’m wasting water washing my hair to sit on my couch, I’m a burden on our welfare and healthcare system. I could go on for days on why I shouldn’t be here. There’s no point to that either.

The last thing on my mind was “oh it was a simple mistake” 

Try not to let it stress you out too much. Post dated cheque’s are fine as long as the funds will be there. I think there are bank fees for bounced cheque’s.

I paid my rent by cheque two days late and later that month got an eviction notice. I’m not sure what the form was called. When I spoke to the management company helpline they explained that if your cheque is not collected and cashed within 24 hours the form is automatically generated and sent out. They told me that if I had paid my rent to simply ignore the form. 

I’m not sure in your case where you are late more often but I don’t think they will evict you. If they attempt to it’s a long drawn out process for everyone and I assume you can prove your rent has been paid. (If you check your online banking you can see a copy of the cheque and the endorsement from your management company) 

Maybe you could have a conversation with the building manager or the management company to explain why you are often late and maybe they would work out a plan with you.

I’m certainly not making the noises he is complaining of but I’d be happy to help locate the noise if I hear anything. It’s been a week now with no more letters so I’m hoping it helped. 

Id get the landlord or super to have the neighbour prove the noise is coming from you. Recordings or having them witness the sound themselves. It’s not up to you to have to defend yourself like this if they haven’t provided proof. That’s how I’m looking at my situation these days anyway.

PanicAttack,ffrukuj,t3_eus1ei,1580166164.0,"My anxiety sometimes manifests as pain in my chest. I used to jump to conclusions and think it was a heart issue but, like you, I wasted too much time in the hospital getting things checked out only to be perfectly fine. My father died of a massive heart attack at a very young age so my doctors always said to be cautious and to pay attention if things feel differently than normal. I took that to mean i was most definitely having a heart attack the first time I experienced the pain. It’s pretty rough but try and remember that you have checked many times and you are healthy. Weigh out the whole situation when you panic. Tell yourself “I know I have panic attacks and I also know my heart health has been perfectly fine in the past, it’s more likely to be panic” I find sometimes reasoning with myself just a little bit will help me calm down enough to start thinking rationally again."

askTO,fepo4zu,t1_fen7nwq,1579325799.0,I think when I deliver the letter to management I will let them know that they need to have proof before sending me another warning. The guy says it’s always the same time after midnight so it should be easy enough for them to predict a time and witness what ever is happening.
askTO,fepnn1u,t1_femo73w,1579325369.0,Thank you for letting me know that. The thought did cross my mind that it was only there to deal with landlord tenant issues. It seems from the replies here that my being evicted is unlikely unless they can prove it’s coming from me. That’s a big help.
askTO,fepnhq8,t1_felywaj,1579325249.0,"I’ve had my cats for 2 1/2 years and I’ve never received a complaint up until 2 months ago. I’ve been in this building over 3 years. I’d assume the cats didn’t suddenly start making noise. This guy may have just moved in or something but still, no previous tenant in that unit ever made a complaint."
askTO,fepnbkm,t1_fem3tdl,1579325105.0,My building was built in the 60’s I believe. It seems to be a pretty solid concrete block of apartments. I’ve never so much as heard someone walking above or around me. That’s why I’m inclined to believe this guy is crazy. Wouldn’t other tenants be complaining about me if I was making this much noise.
askTO,fepn58r,t1_fem8vpv,1579324959.0,I’ve only witnessed one of my cats even play with anything but I can do things to remedy any noise they make jumping off of my bed. It is possible the loud dropping noise is them getting down. The furniture moving and the laundry is still a mystery. I have had periods of insomnia and haven’t heard a sound of noise from cats or even anyone around me.
askTO,fepmjht,t1_felcora,1579324468.0,I get the feeling that it shouldn’t be my responsibility to deal with this guy. I think it should be managements responsibility. They should have to prove that I’m making noise at least. You’re right though that it may just be easier to prove it’s not me.
askTO,fepme1f,t1_felbgdh,1579324340.0,I will 100% give this a try. Thank you.
askTO,fepm8vr,t1_felb63g,1579324223.0,"I live in a building that’s managed by a company notorious for not giving a shit. I can 100% see them doing the minimum to make it look like they are doing something. They seem to have settled on the fact that the noise is me though. Like you said, shifting the blame."
askTO,feplzce,t1_fel9qha,1579324017.0,I can definitely check into that. Even one of those sleep talking apps.
askTO,feplu6l,t1_fel9g6w,1579323904.0,We hear some noise at night. Normal living in an apartment building noises. Nothing nearly as excessive as this guy says he is hearing.
askTO,fepll60,t1_fel6866,1579323707.0,I would love to be able to do this but I simply don’t have the funds. It’s a great idea though.
askTO,feplgzu,t1_felid3t,1579323618.0,I’m not 100% sure when the other tenant moved in but I’ve never recurved a complaint besides this one. I have been living here nearly 3 years. I couldn’t help but think for at least a moment that they were trying to have me evicted. The price of my unit has gone up substantially and a new tenant here would be paying an extra 600 in rent.
askTO,felwmm4,t1_felvu6s,1579232779.0,This is the kind of thing I feel like doing. I’m trying to be a stand up neighbour but at the same time I want to send him poop in the mail.
askTO,felthiz,t1_felsy6e,1579230534.0,It can’t be my cats. They are overweight rescue’s and the highest they can even jump is to the bed. They are older girls and they simply don’t play or run around the apartment. Late at night they are usually sound asleep on the couch or on my pillows.
askTO,felrmie,t1_felrhx5,1579229236.0,Ohh ok. That makes sense. Thank you.
askTO,felrdq4,t1_felqtn3,1579229073.0,I’ve received two warning letters so far. Plus a copy of a written letter the guy downstairs sent to my building manager. I’m going to go to the legal office ASAP to get some back up. I think I might need it after all.
askTO,feldgf6,t3_epq6jh,1579219590.0,"Thank you everyone for your replies. I think I’ll write up that letter, trying not to actually just type “fuck you mister” and send it. There’s also a free legal clinic here in Parkdale that has lawyers who focus on rental issues. I’m going to pay them a visit ASAP. I think they could at least tell me what my options are legally. I’ll also try the apps, even if I’ll probably just record me snoring and my cat occasionally meowing for an early morning snack. 

The building manager doesn’t seem to be interested in the fact that I’ve told him many times that the noise isn’t me. There’s also a pretty big language barrier though. I’ll somehow add in the letter that he needs to locate where the noise is actually coming from. If there is noise. I’ve never heard anything. You’d think if it was that bad someone besides him would notice. 

Thank you again."
PanicAttack,fe7dbia,t3_eo1do4,1578913004.0,I’m so sorry you are going through this. We don’t realize how important proper sleep patterns are until they get thrown off. My sleep has been messed up for months now. I basically can’t sleep until I’m absolutely exhausted. I usually spend 30-35 hours awake and then crash and sleep for 12 -15 hours. It’s getting hard to deal with regular things and I’m having panic attacks regularly. That’s why your title caught my eye. Insomnia is a real ass hole.
SuicideWatch,fcjbsyh,t1_fcg9x92,1577682414.0,I will talk to him. Thank you
SuicideWatch,fcjbq31,t1_fcdb3qk,1577682346.0,I will thank you
