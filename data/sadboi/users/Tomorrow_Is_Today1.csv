Gifted,fqgjaxw,t3_gim82q,1589347777.0,"Freshman year hit me really hard as well. I felt like I was losing focus and motivation, and only fear of failure actually kept me going (which, take it from someone who knows, is never a good thing!!). I think part of the problem is the space that schoolwork and my grades and all that fear of failure was taking up in my mind. Even when I took breaks from working, it wasn't really a break because somewhere in my mind I was still thinking about it. I couldn't feel free because there was always something that had to be done. When I wasn't working, I felt bad about it, but when I tried to work, I could lose focus. I would sometimes gain enough focus at the last minute to scramble to get something done, not worrying as much about how good it would be or sitting around feeling overwhelmed at the thought of starting but just forcing myself to sit down and do it (though even that's quite limited). It's frustrating when your stress only makes itself worse.

One thing I'll say is: stop treating everything like a project. If it's a project that has all these things you have to do to finish it and it has to be of certain quality, that's a lot that you can be overwhelmed by when you're in this burnt out state of mind. Just sit down to do something, write a little poem or draw a random doodle or whatever, and don't act like it'll be good, and don't act like you'll ever return to it. And maybe it's complete and utter garbage. But it's something. You did something.

And you know what else? Make your bed, do your laundry, dust a shelf. Progress is one of the most helpful things to your mind, and not when it's a series of required assignments nagging at your brain, but just something you got done.

Unfortunately there isn't much else I can do to help, but I encourage you to reach out to someone. Asking for help is always a good thing."
Gifted,fqgikqi,t3_gimkww,1589347216.0,"I hear you. I don't have that pressure from my parents like you do, as they're pretty supportive of stuff like writing and piano.

But that's the thing: I never lost it. I just couldn't access it for a while. I'm trying now to support my own creativity without making it an assignment--work on my story thing when I feel like it, but don't force it. I don't feel like writing right now? Maybe I'll draw.

One of the hardest things for me has been wanting to write and to enjoy it but lacking the energy, so because of how burned out I feel, it feels like a chore.

It actually explains a lot about issues I've had growing up beyond just giftedness, and why they blend together even when they may seem unrelated (ex: gender & sexuality). For so long I thought I had to do something with my giftedness. All my teachers would tell me they expected me to be successful later in life, and all around me people would talk about astronauts and scientists and shit and I didn't want any of that. I wanted to settle down. It's just like when a religious person was talking about how ""we are all destined for greatness"" and all I could think was, *I don't want greatness. I want comfort.* And, more than that, I wanted the opposite of greatness. I wanted to be small.

It's never been the giftedness or any other trait of mine that has hurt me. It's other people and their misguided ideas. It's hearing every teacher tell me that I'm so smart and will be successful later in life until I feel like a failure and an imposter. It's feeling guilt for not having to study while at the same time being told by my classmates that they hated me for 'being so smart'. Seeing the people around me brag and complain when I wasn't allowed to do either.

My goals are not and will not be other people's goals for me. I will not grow up to be that bright, successful woman they envision. But I will work with myself to be a healthy, relatively happy person. A gifted person."
