Maybe, we Americans are more open-minded than everyone else thinks. One way of spelling isn’t correct and the other wrong, they are just different. Even within the states themselves, different regions or institutions may use different spellings. Hell, I had a biology teacher in high school from Ireland and in our notes and tests,  etc. she wouldn’t often using  “British” spelling variations. Why fail someone for using an alternative spelling? Isn’t learning supposed to be more about ideas anyways and showing mastery over the actual content not spelling rules? It just seems like a petty reason to fail a student and like maybe the teacher was subconsciously taking out her anger on the student for not spelling words the “correct” Australian way.

AskDocs,f5zaxv2,t3_dpwxc6,1572571932.0,"I was on growth hormone treatment as a child. Let me first say that it is not without side effects and is definitely not something that is going to be prescribed to someone unnecessarily.  Growth hormone treatment is delivered with daily injections and is extremely expensive. You will not be able to find a physician willing to prescribe it to you unless test results demonstrate that you have a legitimate deficiency of growth hormone production or a biological defect that reduces the production or action of IGF-I growth factor. You would have to undergo several tests and perhaps an overnight hospital stay to perform the necessary testing. Our bodies don’t produce growth hormone at a nice easy to measure consistency which makes testing more difficult that a standard blood draw. Not to mention adults produce much lower levels than kids so you would likely need to have much lower levels than a child who hasn’t completed puberty yet would have. If you truly believe you have a growth hormone deficiency then you should start by visiting an endocrinologist.  Bear in mind that since you have passed puberty and your prime growth years treatment may not improve growth although it still does have other important functions in the body. I have to say that 5’4” is really not that short.  Children given growth hormone treatment are usually a fair bit shorter than that and have a projected adult height far below the growth you have already achieved. For example, my adult height without treatment was predicted to be 4’3”,  after four years of growth hormone treatment I am now 5’2”. Not tall by any means but tall enough to look like an adult and function in a world built for people of average height. And to be honest people still think I am about five or ten years younger than I am and they always have... I see this as a blessing. I know it seems really important right now to be taller and older looking but ultimately it doesn’t matter so don’t let it stop you from living your best life. I am curious about a few things.. have you ever been tested in the past? If no, why not? Why is this something you are exploring now instead of during child? Have you ever stopped growing completely for months or years during childhood or was your growth pretty consistent throughout your childhood?"

Where were people at the time of the call? Was it during school hours or after? Where were the calls made from? Where was Mazurek when those calls were made? There is just so much that seems to have been unexplored. Were DNA samples obtained from students and faculty at the boarding school?  What about the DNA found at the 2006 Munich murder scene? Just because the DNA recovered from that scene doesn’t belong to her murderer doesn’t mean it doesn’t belong to someone in her circle of family and friends that could have committed Ursula’s murder. The article stated that she was a wealthy woman living in Munich. Perhaps there was a connection with someone from that elite boarding school.  Have they investigated links between the 2006 murder victim’s family and friends and the boarding school? That honestly seems like the best lead in the case and it was dismissed relatively quickly without too much investigation which is unsettling.
UnresolvedMysteries,f1bngzk,t1_f1ajmpr,1569338704.0,"To add to that. According to the adoptive parents she did not in fact grow at all during the time they had her in their care. Like, not even a millimeter. When they first brought her home she was what would be considered an adult height for someone with Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. Also, just want to point out to everyone that when the doctors read the bone scans to determine her age to be 8 and then 11 they likely would have relied heavily on what her reported age was to draw their conclusions. As someone who had a growth disorder as a child I am somewhat familiar with “bone age” determinations. Basically they look at changes in the wrist joint of wrist bones. My bone age was always younger than my actual age. In someone with Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia underdevelopment and fragmentation of the bone and cartilage of the epiphyses,  which are the rounded ends or “heads” of the long bones would make it very difficult to accurately determine chronological age merely by looking at the bones. Abnormal growth or development of cartilage and bones is the hallmark of the Skeletal Dysplasias. Even in “normal” or typically developing children bone age does not always equal chronological age, mine never did! I would put more weight on the determination of age by the psychologist and dentists. Teeth, especially, can give a much more accurate assessment of age. I personally would only consider radiological evidence supporting the persons age if the report was made by a specialist in Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. In fact I would have been very interested to hear what a Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia specialist would have said if they were asked to assess her age back in 2012. If I had been the parents or the judge I think I would have insisted on bringing her to such a specialist to obtain there professional opinion. I did see the pictures of her and I do not think she looks like a child at all nor does she appear to carry herself like a small child would. I imagine that if I had never received treatment for my growth disorder people would probably still think I was a child and I am nearly 40 now. Even with treatment and having reached a normal adult height I am often judged to be at least 10 years younger than my actual age."

There are easier and more effective ways of waking a person that don’t involve touching.

Nobody ever tried to touch my baby when in the moby wrap. Plus those infant seats take up too much space in the grocery cart. Also, the convertible lasts a lot longer and you’ll need to buy one anyways. My 5 year old, who is tiny btw, is still in his convertible car seat and I have no plans of taking him out of it anytime soon."
talesfromcallcenters,ewbpmhu,t3_cncqoo,1565270376.0,"I’m betting this guy had to pay $200 to get this script because his insurance plan doesn’t have enough in-plan providers that are able to prescribe Suboxone and he couldn’t get an appointment with an in-plan doctor. There aren’t enough of these doctors to go around and then for insurance to not cover this script unless it’s made by an in-plan provider during the worst opiate epidemic this country has ever seen is just ludicrous. OP, trust me, if he wanted to abuse something suboxone would definitely not be his first choice. He could have got something way better for $200. Clearly he is trying to either get or stay sober and op’s judgmental attitude is just perpetuating the stigma of addiction. Then to come on reddit and post about this man’s struggle, painting a man struggling with a horrible, painful addiction as if he is the scum of the earth, makes it even worse. Clearly op shows an ignorant lack of compassion, empathy, and professionalism . SMH! So OP, in the future, if you still have a job, when this situation arises again(and it will) remember it is your job to help not judge and scorn. Perhaps you could have tried to help the caller find an in-plan provider that he could get an appointment with or find a way for him to get an emergency fill of his meds. Or locate resources to help him pay for the script. Lots of programs out there and lots of ways to help but this reddit post isn’t one of them!"
