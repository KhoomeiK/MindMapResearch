Yamaha,exz9h30,t3_cqbpjd,1566662804.0,"Just doing an oil change on my 2015 R3 at the mechanics/dealerships in the area is well over $100 USD. average is about $130, which is what I ended up paying. Bikes are more expensive to maintain than cars, for sure."

lifehacks,exkssgm,t3_ctdibo,1566398110.0,I always went with choose 3 places and we will pick from there. If we can't make a decision quickly on our own we just roll dice. It has solved a lot of my own issues with indecision.

sex,ewv92g0,t1_ewv89qs,1565801316.0,"Similar feelings here. While women have never actually made fun of my hands, I NEVER have gotten compliments. Men more often than not will make fun of my smaller hands. Even though I wear medium sized gloves, when everyone else wears at least large it is pretty easy to feel like the odd one out."
sex,ewv53c5,t1_ewuqsax,1565798841.0,"Yeah, I have pretty small hands as well, it sucks and I hate it. I have wonder palms than my girlfriend, but her fingers are like an inch longer than mine. It makes a lot of things I like to do harder. It doesn't matter how strong my grip is or whatever, nobody looks at small hands on a dude and thinks ""oh boy, look at those tiny, sexy hands"". I have a lot of good qualities, to be sure, but big sexy hands are not one of them lol."

Yamaha,evbcypn,t3_chdi1u,1564373019.0,"If the MT-03 is anything like my R3, then you should get steel braided brake lines. Made my braking experience so much better. I also suggest frame sliders, but honestly I still need to follow my own advice there haha."
sex,ete09jr,t3_cb9hj6,1562719671.0,"Honestly man, a similar thing happened to me fairly recently with a new woman I was with. I had such crazy butterflies that I haven't had with a partner in a while that once the condom went on everything just kinda shut down down there. It was super embarrassing, but I talked to her about it and she was super understanding, and I'm still getting calls from her so sometimes it doesn't matter if you make a few mistakes. My advice; learn how to use your hands and mouth to make up for when your junk needs a little time to get ready. Chances are, if you can make her cum with oral or hand stimulation, she will be much more patient and understanding if you need a little extra coaxing to get over your nerves."
Yamaha,esza9qw,t3_c9b6wc,1562358149.0,"I own one in black, and yeah, this thing is sweet. I added steel braided brake lines to mine, makes the braking soooooooo much better, even without replacing the pads. So flickable, and the engine is arguably the best out of the 300cc-400cc class (Ninja 400 has more power for sure, but the R3 engine is better balanced for all around riding). I don't think I am going to trade mine in anytime soon."
Pathfinder_RPG,er7mvqi,t1_er4cfwv,1560581806.0,"Eh, its powerful, but not game breaking. Paladins get a similar ability from level 1, after all."
