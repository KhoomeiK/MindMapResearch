There will be times like this, and others, where your opinion or idea will conflict with your parents, spouse, friends, coworkers. 

I'd really suggest taking this time to develop your voice and express yourself. Just because you have asian parents doesn't mean you have to be destined for a life getting walked all over."

 I'm not sure how normal laying in bed and cuddling with parents is after a certain age...

What is normal is growing out of that behavior eventually and saving that for one-off moments. It's also normal to establish personal boundaries whether they like it or not.

They may not agree with you, but it's best to start trying to form healthy habits with your parents before you let it make you resentful and wind up not wanting to be around your parents at all when you're older."

 If she wants to talk about being concerned for the health of the baby, she needs to chill and let you handle your adult life.

You need to re-evaluate what you just said. ""It felt like the right idea AT THE TIME."" 

If you're feeling this way already, okay, great. Fine. Love is wonderful. But it'd be in your best interest to see if you still feel that way in the next 3-5 years. It'd be even more special if you can propose after having a long, enduring relationship and grow together.

And how come he didn't trust you enough or care for you enough to try to prove or explain yourself before he just decided to cut you out? 

I understand how hurt you are, but I'd advise you to ask these questions to yourself and perhaps him if you can get in touch with him. 

And while I can also understand maybe his shock and hurt to see that fake profile, I wouldn't consider automatically trusting his ex and dumping you without a chance to communicate about it as normal behavior in a long term relationship."

relationships,fkr7mpv,t1_fkqv7zp,1584463420.0,"Okay, but just because your boyfriend's mother needs to learn respect and boundaries, doesn't mean the cat needs to be put down.

 My cats are 100% domesticated, but still act like cats when they're scared or intimidated. What that means is, if they feel threatened they go into fight-or-flight mode. Sometimes, they run and hide, and other times, may feel the need to defend themselves. The cat was in an unfamiliar territory with unfamiliar animals. It was your boyfriend's mother's fault for bringing them along. It's not the cat's fault it was being a cat. 

Please reconsider this. The cat doesn't need to be punished. Your boyfriend's mother does. Consider having your boyfriend express his disgust and disappointment with her behavior, and threaten to exclude her from all family events moving forward if her attitude continues."

They always make it a point to tell him as we're leaving that he's always welcome to move back home at anytime, when they know we live together and are building a life together. And then the next day, are texting him asking when he's coming over again. I just don't like people like this, and I think it's a breach of boundaries and respect. So naturally, I don't want to see them. SO gets mad at me when I don't wanna go, then can't seem to understand my point of view.
