SuicideWatch,fjlbxjz,t1_fjl68k3,1583443870.0,"This is exactly why I’m afraid to end it. I would like to think that I would “remember” to follow my heart despite it all. I have very crippling social anxiety starting from childhood where I was selectively mute. I never talked and had few friends. Growing up, I was extremely unfortunate looking and an easy target for bullies. I was called every name in the book. I was made to feel less than and I soon internalized it. I hate myself. It’s not even about the kids that bullied me (I forgave them) it’s just that all of that programming is engrained so deeply into my psyche. For a long time, I operated from that place. I had toxic abusive friends that treated me so badly that I don’t trust anyone. It’s gotten to the point where if someone shows interest in me (platonic or romantic), I immediately look for ways to confirm that they’re bad and distance myself. I think that I might have PTSD??

On top of that, my dad was abusive and I witnessed a lot of domestic violence. I just feel like a failure. I went to college and graduated four years ago but I can’t find employment (out of work for 9 months), I’m 27 and live at home, I am socially isolated and inept. I haven’t met any social milestones. Everyone criticizes me harshly for who I am as a result. 

I’ve always had problems but no one helped me. I wanted to see a psychiatrist at 16 for my mental issues but my mom mocked me. She didn’t put me on her insurance plan causing me to be unable to see one later as an adult. My mom has constantly sabotaged me. I lost nearly 80 lbs after high school but she kept calling me fat causing me to gain it back. She constantly discourages me from moving out, working, dating, and living a normal life. It’s like she wants me to be as miserable as she is.

I’m just stagnant and exhausted at this point. If I reincarnate, I wonder if it will be worse than this??   I wrestle with this but I’m at a point of just wanting to go home. I want to be with “people” that love me for the soul that I am. I never felt that I belonged and the feeling is only magnified."

I failed myself during undergrad and didn’t take research opportunities that were practically thrown at me by my professors. I decided to fill my time with volunteering and clinical service for my med app. I regret it so much because I don’t have a career that’s interested or mentally stimulating at all. Sorry for the rant.

Do you know of another route?"

While I was able to come to the conclusion that a lot of my negative thought forms hidden deep within my subconscious are due to the way others treated me, I still struggle. I just can’t control it. My body weakens or becomes numb with everyday. I’m just mentally exhausted and unhappy. I realize that while these thoughts exist and my reality is a reflection of my mind, I can’t break free. I think it’s because I just truly hate myself and my life. I am constantly being attacked for existing by others and it’s not fair. My life isn’t what I envisioned it to be when I was younger and it sucks."
publichealth,ffc8mrx,t3_cwf7l1,1579794046.0,"Hi, I’m thinking heavily about getting a MSPH in epidemiology or health policy with a focus on data analytics. I have a few questions though! I’ll be 4 years post undergrad soon and I have very minimal research experience. I completed a summer research internship and a capstone course during undergrad but that’s about it. Since graduating, I have completed a year with AmeriCorps and worked primarily in healthcare. I was premed but I soon realized that I’d rather focus on examining and mitigating health and education disparities instead.

My question is, do programs expect applicants to already have a strong foothold in research and/or data analysis? I was strong in both areas during undergrad but I was more drawn to service. I don’t regret my decisions but I wish that I put more time into research.

Nevertheless, I was wondering what the average applicant would look like? I really love the program at UNC, UMD, or JHU and would like some insight.

I’ll be studying for the GRE in the meantime."

I didn’t realize how detrimental my negative thought patterns were until recently. It’s the primary reason why I’ve held myself back from experiencing life. I hated myself and didn’t think I deserved happiness because of lies I was fed by virtually everyone for years. The reason why I finally woke up? I finally became mentally exhausted due to beating myself for years. It finally took a mental toll. On top of all this, I have social anxiety disorder. Even with all of these mental obstacles, I’m finally taking my life back."

depression,fc4d0ew,t3_efwqy4,1577413114.0,"I guess that’s the point of living. We have one life yet tomorrow is never promised. Sometimes, I wish that I incarnated as a bee or fly.. I’d have a shorter life filled with meaning and purpose. However, humans aren’t pre-programmed with purpose because we have free will. We all come with different personalities, perspectives, cultures, backgrounds, and ways of being. It complicates things and makes our experiences unique yet similar at the same time. We all experience seven universal forms of emotions, anxiety, depression, self-doubt, motivation, love, and resilience in the face of adversity.. even though we’re different. I’m beginning to realize that the meaning or purpose of life isn’t as obscure and rigid as most would have us believe. The biggest hurdle is finding purpose."
depression,fbswe6t,t3_ee58qm,1577061998.0,"I’m so sorry that this is happening to you. My parents completely denied that I was severely depressed with social anxiety disorder during my teen years and I suffer immensely as a result years later. They just see/saw me as lazy and mocked me when I literally cried to them for help after I had my first mental breakdown. After not getting help for years, I’m finally getting to the point where I’m owning my problems for the first time. I’m finally comfortable with acknowledging my mental help. I no longer neglect myself and I’m trying for once. Don’t give up on yourself like I did because of your mom’s reaction. I know that it’s tough because those we trust the most should support us but be selfish and put your needs first. Whatever those needs may be.. put your mental health first."
