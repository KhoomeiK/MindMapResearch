Yes, doubt is logical and is a powerful incentive to be critical, to check sources, research and read data. Doubt is not an excuse to reject existing official data without a bout of any actual evidence to do so. 

You have it all wrong. I don't have to prove the established because it's already been proven, hence why it's established. I also don't have any desire to show that it's been proven and how because in my experience discussing these topics with people like you is completely pointless. Conspiracy theorists are the ones who are on a crusade to disprove established and proven information and promote the theories they pulled out of their bums to the public. 

Hiding behind skepticism is convenient, but also laughable when this skepticism is entirely selective. Conspiracy theorists are skeptical of the known, the documented, the official and anything that's backed by evidence. But when a random person writes a Facebook post or makes a Youtube video labeled ""THE TRUTH"" which spews pure and utter rubbish, they click the Share button before a single neuron connection is made in their brain whether what they just heard holds any credibility and makes any sense whatsoever."

A pretty reliable indicator of country morbidity is confirmed cases per number of tests done (the so called ""positive %"" in graphs and tables). Right now for Bulgaria it's approximately 3.5%, compared to 10% in Romania, 19% in Serbia, 40.9% in New York City and 1.7% in New Zealand. 

Of course interpreting these data should be done with caution. It's no use comparing positive % between a country with a policy of broad testing and a country testing selectively and scarcely.

I'm talking about the fact Walter probably never did it for his family, or not mainly for his family at least. It was always about himself first. He was in a midlife crisis even before he got the diagnosis. Cancer was just what sparked the flame and made him realize it's now or never. He did it for the validation and self-indulgence. He wanted to finally be fulfilled with himself. 
The family motive wasn't much more than a way for him to justify himself and a version to tell Skyler to try and make her understand. As the story progresses, I think it gets pretty clear his motive was self-interest all along. And don't get me wrong, I think he loved his family til the end.

In Italy, as of yesterday, the John Hopkins map shows 86 thousand confirmed infected of which 66 thousand are still active cases. It doesn't make sense to count confirmed mortality as what part of total confirmed cases have ended in death since that  number will largely change in the future as the fate of active cases gets determined. Let's look at the mortality of tested patients whose outcome of the illness is known. That's roughly 20 000 patients. Of them 9134 have died. That's a 46% mortality among patients who have HAD the disease and were confirmed. 
In Spain the number is 32%. 
In comparison, in China, where there are very few active cases left, that same number is 4%.

The heart isn't the only muscle that doesn't get tired of repeated contractions. Think about your diaphragm and intercostal muscles - they contract and relax at a fixed rate throughout our whole life much like the heart does.

Edit: A few people are pointing out these muscles too can get fatigued and feel sore. 

What I meant with my analogy is that the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles, much like the heart, don't get fatigued of contracting at a fixed rate indefinitely under normal conditions. Let's make a comparison with other muscles. What our diaphragm does is kind of the equivalent of walking 24 hours a day for 75 years. Our leg muscles could never pull that off, even if we walked at a very slow and fixed rate. 

This doesn't mean our diaphragm and intercostal muscles can't get fatigued when they're pushed to their limits and are forced to contract at a much higher pace but oxygen supply doesn't suffice their needs. 
In conditions of heavy oxygen requirements every muscle in our body can get fatigued and start to hurt. Including the heart, as seen with angina episodes when people with ischemic heart disease do physical exercise."

LivestreamFail,f0mgy7p,t1_f0mbmry,1568744729.0,"I know very well that the perspective of a suicidal person differs greatly from my own and this is kind of the point of what I said. I wrote my comment in regards to the topic of why suicidal behavior is not rational behavior and why it is hard or in some cases impossible for suicidal people to realize their irrationality. 
""Right, so why would they think the future would go otherwise."" They wouldn't, which is the message I tried (and seemingly failed) to convey. Statistically, at least in the case of clinical depression in particular, medicinial and psychological treatment and rehabilitation is a viable option with a decent success rate. But severely depressed individuals who contemplate suicide are discouraged and hopeless, they generally do not believe they can be helped and get better. 

""Depressed person hasn't seen otherwise"". I completely disagree. I'm a medical student and I've worked with patients with clinical depression. It's always ups and downs but the downs severely outweigh the ups. That's why I say with confidence life isn't always only suffering for them, it is mostly suffering. That being said, sometimes the few things that excite them and bring them joy are enough to give them the will to carry on and try and fight. Noticing what makes a severely depressed person happy and emphasizing on it as much as you possibly can is often what keeps them on their feet, even if for a little while."

LivestreamFail,f0m9dx5,t1_f0lnag9,1568739819.0,"For starters, life isn't always only suffering. Thinking it will never get better because you have suffered for a long time is part of that irrationality. People do get better, people do move on. It isn't always only bad. But in the case of suicidal people, life has pushed them to the ground so bad that in those moments when they wanna end it all, it's impossible to realize that there are things worth living for."

It wastes time. Keep up the external cardiac massage for at least 7-8 minutes before starting mouth to mouth. The lungs have a residual volume of oxygen which is why you do not need to start supplying them with oxygen right away. This is important to know because one of the main reasons for failed CPR is not being able to keep a decent rate per minute. Not wasting time on repositioning yourself and breathing mouth to mouth could be crucial for keeping that rate."

Intermediate metabolites are useful to know because it pinpoints which metabolite accumulates or lacks based on the affected enzyme. Still, med students have to learn approximately 200 reactions, which is far, far from all the metabolic reactions in the body."
