I almost feel like the doctor should advice the patient on how to ”work with” this medicine. 
Fortunately the first doctor who prescribed this to me did exactly that!
It is indeed a wonderful sleep aid as long as you give yourself enough time to sleep. Going to bed well before midnight and having a full nights rest is crucial. If you short change on that, it’s awful. 
Conversely you have to also make sure that you don’t sleep too much. That actually makes you more tired and leads to increased depression. 
A short (well timed) mid day nap also helps. 
Good quality regular sleep will do wonders for depression. 
The same doctor also told me to work out when starting this drug. This way the initial weight gain goes to the right places so to speak. The added exercise will wake you back up and again does wonders for depression. 
In my experience (this is personal) the weight gain levels out and stops after a few months of use.

Also my problem used not to be so much falling asleep but waking up to pee and my mind spinning and not being able to go back to sleep. Now that’s totally a non issue and YES that’s putting me in a better mood."
solotravel,ffzk4jx,t1_ffyrzg6,1580383088.0,"It’s your reaction to the pollution, which is a serious issue here, especially this time of year."
depressionregimens,ffwitba,t3_evakxh,1580302433.0,"As someone posted earlier, it takes a few weeks for the body to adjust. Those heavy duty initial side effects will dissipate. Also worth repeating: do set enough time aside for sleep. That said, it’s easy on lower doses of this drug to sleep too much, which is not a desirable thing either. A cup of coffee in the morning definitely helps."
ThailandTourism,ffkkn4w,t3_eu3dah,1580024337.0,I would skip Pattaya and maybe go to Hua Hin or Koh Samet.
ThailandTourism,ffbhw2z,t3_eso2cd,1579766045.0,"I’ve done it many times, never had any issues. Zero."
phenibut,ff89f7t,t1_ff81vex,1579669902.0,"Alas there have been virtually no scientific studies on this compound. In that sense we are our own test subjects or lab rats, depending on your views. 
However if you spend just ten or fifteen minutes in the sub Reddit r/quitingpenibut you will find story, after story after story of people getting intense seizures using and especially when they stop using phenibut. Many of them even ending up in the emergency room."
phenibut,ff7npzd,t1_ff6zfju,1579653938.0,You haven't been reading that much. Seizures are actually quite common though usually when people stop using.
phenibut,ff5q2sd,t3_ero27s,1579605560.0,"If this is what happens to your teeth, stop and think what it does for your gut. Don’t take my word for it, do a quick google search and you find people puking bile as well as blood. 
This stuff is extremely acidic, being in your mouth for mere seconds before it travels slowly through the rest of your system."
ThailandTourism,ff4iioc,t3_eqzdfo,1579564435.0,"Not much group activities but do stay in guest houses and frequent cool coffee shops and restaurants. Also I practice Thai massage, so I often will take a course (guess that is a group activity :-)"
chiangmai,ff2gtax,t3_er9mqi,1579505510.0,"So many GREAT coffee shops in Chiang Mai, most of them sell their own beans. Google the good stuff Chiang Mai. It’s a great blog with photos of eats and drinks in Chiang Mai. Very well written with beautiful photos. It lists a wide variety of unique and cozy coffee shops. You will be in for a treat and are going to be pleasantly surprised to find coffee grown in northern Thailand and Laos."
ThailandTourism,ff10fgo,t3_eqzdfo,1579474030.0,I’m leaving tonight for my 15th journey to the kingdom. You start to establish friends and connections. It becomes a second home. Wouldn’t do it any other way.
phenibut,fel4plb,t3_epox8w,1579214004.0,It’s indeed related. Take it as a warning from your central nervous system to taper down slowly and get off this stuff.
phenibut,fegv39h,t3_ep0lt7,1579103199.0,"This is simply not sustainable, you’ll be an addict before you know it."
Mirtazapine_Remeron,feff6by,t3_eou1y3,1579055030.0,I also take mirtazapine at a dose of 7.5 mg and it helps me a lot. The lower the dose the better it is for sleep.  At this dose it doesn’t give me a dry mouth. The first week or two are always going to be an adjustment for your brain and truly a medicine like this takes about 4 to 6 weeks to really settle in. So please don’t be alarmed at the side effects of the first few days. Those are completely to be expected and will subside.
phenibut,feelxwd,t3_eopr28,1579036430.0,"Using phenibut to get off Kratom is like snorting heroin to reduce cravings for weed. Seriously, don’t change one addiction for another that will be far, far worse."
Mirtazapine_Remeron,fe6n6gf,t3_ensagp,1578896710.0,"When using mirtazapine for sleep, a smaller dose actually works better then a larger one. 7.5 mg will make you sleep like a baby."
ThailandTourism,fdm491w,t3_em32un,1578539424.0,I’ve been to Thailand fourteen times and have entered by air as well as overland (Malaysia and Laos) NEVER even a hint of having to pay a bribe.
ThailandTourism,fdld4v8,t3_elxiyj,1578521473.0,"This makes me dizzy just looking at it :-) 
Day trip to Pai? It’s at least 4 Hours drive each way.
Same with the island hopping. So much nicer to stay on one Island and then look for the best beach there is in that particular island. 
This reminds me of a woman  I met  on a trip showing me her photos and she had to look at the dates otherwise she didn’t know what places the photos were taken in. 
Cha-cha, the Thai expression for slowing down, makes everything better. WAY better. 
You get to know cozy restaurants, minimal zing the risk of getting sick. Maybe you even  meet a new friend. You “soak in the culture”, so to speak. 
Like a previous poster said: less is definitely way more!"
