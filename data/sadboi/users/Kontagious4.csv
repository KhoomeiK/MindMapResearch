Or Helpx and work away are two websites where ppl give you a place to stay and sometimes food for doing half a days work around their house each day or even less.  There's also something in the UK I just found out about thru a mini Netflix series called property guardianship, where you pay small amounts of rent to stay in and keep an eye on buildings of businesses that closed down.  Where there's will there's a way dude.  Bring 50 resumes with you, you can print stuff cheap at libraries but it's still a good idea to have hard copies ready.

Edit: Also temp agencies can be really helpful, you often don't have to have much if any experience and they can usually hook you up with jobs in other towns.  Best one I had started with just 1.

Sleep deprivation is good for seeing extra stuff too, but combining that with acid is dangerous.  Like someone said having a plan is wise but I'll add have something that puts you down too, not just supplements the come down, is worthwhile too because it can linger once in a while and make you loopy to say the least.  Sleep resets your sanity or at least brings you a step closer each time.  Have a reminder that you took L somewhere you will see eventually.  Using it as a tool and not a party drug is where it's at though imo.  I see hues and the colors in other ways numerous times a day and I haven't tripped in over five years.  They were distracting and confusing at times but now are just helpful."
