Tulpas,forgl6c,t3_g8wk9l,1588011877.0,"1. Yes and no. You should be in a good mental condition before creating a tulpa. Maturity is important too. If you just want a cute neko boy who looks like a girl and likes yaoi :3 uwu then you shouldn't create tulpa.
2. If your tulpa isn't a homophobic asshole it's not a problem.
3. No. While creating a tulpa you can suggest how he/she could look like, or what could be his/her interests."
