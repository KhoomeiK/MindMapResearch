Get rid of the splash page. It looks cheap, unprofessional and empty and doesn't make me want to click through. If the web address took you straight to the catalogue, I think it'd look a lot nicer.

Get rid of the red highlights. Black and white would look so nice and clean; the red feels a little like someone just learned to make a website. (The red IS effective where you're using it to indicate a sale/lowered price.)

The logo looks really nice and pro! Looking at just the top of the screen, I'm into it.

While reading through this thread, I thought of a name I'd never considered before and genuinely got butterflies at the idea of being called by it. 

I guess what I want to ask is whether you felt any guilt about it? I definitely don't think you should, but the fact that I do sort of makes me feel like I might regret doing it.

A little stairway, a little piece of carpet
A pair of mirrors that are facing one another
Out in both directions, a thousand little Julias
That come together in the middle of Manhattan

In the shadow of your first attack
