There can be a lot of strong, confusing feelings around it. Besides that, it's healthy and normal to question your beliefs sometimes and keep your motives in check. 

And everytime I remember why I wouldn't want kids and why I'm so sure about this. Aside from the obvious (economy, environment, society, ...), I just feel deep down that it's not for me. This isn't what I'm supposed to do. 

And I realize that I don't actually want _kids_, I just don't want to miss out. There is this huge thing in my loved one's lifes that I won't ever experience. But I can be part of their lifes and be close to them without it. And then I'm at peace with this, because it's not something I actually want for myself. 

Overall, I think it's important to be kind and gentle to yourself and value your own emotions around such a sensitive, confusing topic rather than condemning yourself and jumping to conclusions that may not actually apply to your life and what you want."

You're not a monster for having feelings, hun. As long as you don't act on it, there's nothing wrong with being attracted to people! 

That said it sounds to me like you're projecting a lot into this man. Maybe think about whether you really know him that well. What do you guys have in common? What's about his family, his hobbies, his habits, his friends, his opinions? He's married and it's his job to be attentive and figure out how to keep things going. 

My advice would be to just give it some time and not be too hard on yourself. Be thankful that you're feeling better and if this keeps being a problem, then don't hesitate to seek help. You are not crazy. In fact, you are smart and sensible to not compromise your professional career. You seem very insightful about all of this.

We could already be agreeing, but I'm unsure who you are referring to here. In case you mean someone with this disorder who has already hurt you, then it's totally fair.

And as I said, you don't have to engage with anyone with BPD. It's everyone's right to set their boundaries and spend their time however they wish.

It's not fair however to _stigmatize_ innocent people with BPD, as there are many who don't engage in toxic behavior. And while you don't have to deal with anyone you don't want to, those people are still worthy of respect. It would make your own behavior just as bad."
