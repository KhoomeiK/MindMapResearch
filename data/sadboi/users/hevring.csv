confused... last psu i got (corsair cx) blew a day after use, fried my computer. now my new evga 650 g+ may have made a popping noise while starting up after checking my hard drive and repairing. brand new build, it popped once but isnt smoking or smelling. works perfectly fine still.

- b450 tomahawk
- ryzen 5 2600
- gtx 1060
- 2x 8gb g.skill ram
- several years old barracuda 500 hdd (which booted up fine after repair
- case is nzxt h510 if it matters

should i be worried? do i need to open it to check for damage? the psus have all been plugged into a surge protector. ive turned off the psu and unplugged it for now just in case. no idea what made that noise but im a bit worried."
