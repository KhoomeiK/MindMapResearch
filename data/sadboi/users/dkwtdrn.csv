AmItheAsshole,fjbhpa6,t1_fjbhloc,1583193519.0,Would you recommend me giving them a call back or would just leaving it be a better approach?

AmItheAsshole,fjbf725,t1_fjbez34,1583191942.0,"It was an honest mistake but the treatment was extremely harsh. Regardless of whether or not it was about race, I feel like they were in the wrong. I was already embarrassed enough without them salting the wounds."
