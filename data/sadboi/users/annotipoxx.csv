1. Lacks compassion for others
2. Appeals for anger and fear
3. Self centered
4. Lies constantly
5. Speaks about his own daughter in a sexualized way
6. Shows no attempt to love his enemies or even forgive them
7. Does not model sacrifice (ex. moving to the back of the line for someone else) 
8. Doesn’t care about the poor (though this is very controversial)
9. Loves his money more than anything
10. Shows so much hypocrisy (there is literally a subreddit for this)
