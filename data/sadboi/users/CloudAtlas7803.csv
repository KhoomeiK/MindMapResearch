FemdomCommunity,fnh2uw7,t1_fnh1ux6,1586953369.0,"You mentioned that you’re in an emotionally vulnerable place right now which may be heightening your anxiety, which I think that most people would have in a situation like this regardless of their emotional state. Why don’t you try writing down your feelings before you open a dialogue. Take your time, the first step is realizing that it’s an issue. Take a day and practice some self care, maybe a bath with bubbles and some comfy clothes after. Curl up somewhere you feel safe and write down how you feel, I find that it helps me a lot to get my feelings out somehow so that they’re not as charged. If she doesn’t care then she doesn’t deserve you point blank and someone else would be the luckiest person in the world to have your level of care. The dedication of a sub is something that’s earned. I hope that you don’t lose sight of your value, no matter how this plays out

Maybe it’s worth mentioning that I’m the Domme in my relationship. I struggle with mental health issues that can make me unstable at times but even despite that I couldn’t imagine treating my sweet boy like this :/"

I second what another poster said, people that love each other don’t speak to each other that way. It’s important that you talk about it, as I’m sure you will, and be adamant. Your relationship is an exchange. You do what you do for your partner because it’s what puts you in the space that you need to be in to be emotionally fulfilled, and making her happy comes along with that. Whoever that person is is so so blessed to have you as a lover. Their end of the relationship is constantly reiterating their appreciation for you, because they do, and good subs need to be told how good they are. 

Yes we’re in the middle of a pandemic and we’re all stressed, which means that you need reassurance too. So be sure to remind her what you need and what you deserve for all of your incredible behavior. If you ever forget then something is wrong and that’s always a conversation that needs to be had.

I’m sorry that you’re going through this OP, it sounds as though you truly love each other or you wouldn’t do all of this for your partner never mind move all the way to bumfuck nowhere for this person so I have high hopes that the conversation will go well. Of course, I think it’s always a good idea to validate the other person while having a tense conversation. For instance, “I know how stressed you’ve been and how hard it’s been lately. I also want you to know that I see all of the hard work you’ve been doing and I love you for it.” It’s always nice to be appreciated, as I’m sure you know. It’s also a neutralizer to minimize a defensive response.

Best of luck OP <3 you deserve the world"

sex,fn5gd0i,t1_fn5epau,1586664144.0,"Sounds like a humiliation kink. People often process deep rooted complexes in sexual contexts. For instance, rape victims often are in CNC (consensual non-consent) in the bedroom. Adults molested as children often are into the Dd/lg dynamic, which is the Daddy Dom/little girl dynamic. Often there is age regression, sometimes it’s a result of neglectful and/or abusive parents and they seek the caretaker aspect of the dynamic. Some men that have complexes with small penises enjoy humiliation in the bedroom where they get told by their partners that their dicks aren’t enough etc. sometimes they’re into cuckolding, which is watching your partner have sex with another person. The list goes on and on. The psychological implications of kink and BDSM are really so fascinating. Maybe you should look into it so that you can understand your partner more (: it’s nothing for her to be ashamed of and it can be a really fulfilling experience for the two of you."

Stonewalling is a form of gaslighting. Many people don’t mean to do it, maybe they weren’t taught effective communication growing up and that’s okay and understandable. Unfortunately it has nothing but a negative impact on interpersonal relationships and is often a red flag that can be seen in many abusive relationships. 

Yes. Needing space is understandable and should be respected as an individual need, but stonewalling isn’t the way to get there. There are words for these tendencies for a reason. 

Yes she is in the wrong for many things too I’m sure, but that doesn’t matter for the purpose of explaining what it means to shut down rather than express the desire for space."

I KNOW that if I knew someone with that style of domination I would feel 20x more relaxed and safe because I know they would check in constantly and make sure I’m okay. I know they wouldn’t use a flogger above my shoulders, and that if they left me bound and gagged I would have a bell in my hand so that I could call a safe word without words.

FemdomCommunity,fmsoxkv,t1_fmrt6sy,1586359610.0,"I’m open to submitting and crave it often. It’s the feeling behind his ‘dominance’ that I don’t like. It’s very rooted in insecurity. Either I feel awkward and like my submission is being used as a tool to mend his feelings of inadequacy, or he’s just not firm enough and doesn’t put in enough effort to access that place inside of him if it does exist. I have requests from a Dom as well, I want him to care enough to do research and have an idea of what it means to be a Dom. I’m a very thorough Domme. I wrote out a contract, I check in often to see how he’s doing, when I hold his face in my hand I hold it firmly, I ask him what he wants, what he likes, how he likes it. FUNishments, punishments, the whole shebang.

It’s not that I want him to write me a contract it’s just that in order for me to submit I need to trust my Dom and that takes a certain amount of enthusiasm, and it’s not that I don’t love him or think that he would give me everything that I want if he knew how, it’s that I don’t trust that he knows what he’s doing enough for me to comfortably submit. I also seem to have some mixed reactions to being restrained, either I have a panic-like reaction and need it to stop, or I want it to turn into a CNC-like situation. That or I get into little space which is a reeeeaaaalllly vulnerable place for me and needs to be handled with so much care. It seems like there’s a lot that I need in order to feel safe and comfortable enough to submit, and then I need a firm enough and strong enough hand to sit my happy ass down when I laugh in his face.. 

In some way I feel like I’m being hard on him, but for now this is what it is and it’s not personal it’s just more complicated than both of us would like lol We’re both learning, we just need to take it slow. I think that right now it’s best for us not to explore my submission and I’m okay with that. As long as he doesn’t tease me talking about spanking me and leaving me bruises when he knows damn well he wouldn’t leave a mark on me... haha what a tease"

FemdomCommunity,fmrpgxx,t3_fwyne7,1586330718.0,"My sub just went through something similar, and it was all such bad timing because of the shut down so we have pretty much had to work through it over the phone :/ 

He started becoming insecure in his life for other reasons outside of me but insecurities have a way of worming their way into everything. Anxiety is a very disruptive beast and I’m empathetic towards that, but it started to put us both in strange and awkward situations with each other. Things had gotten weird sexually and I simply wasn’t satisfied nor had I been for a while. Then he started trying to be dominant to feel more secure and it was just strange. It bothered me because I expressed that I didn’t want to be dominated before and it was clear that it was coming out of a place of insecurity. Of course I wasn’t dominating him during this time, I would never push a dynamic on him if he wasn’t begging for it. I’m one of those people where a soft yes isn’t enough for me.

I’m a switch and it just so happens that I’m the Dominant in this relationship. It’s actually the first relationship that I’ve ever been dominant sexually in but it seems as though it is central to our relationship and essential for us to be satisfied sexually with each other. I came very close these last couple of days to settling into acceptance that I wasn’t happy and that it probably wouldn’t work out between us.

Before I decided to stop seeing him, so that I could keep my dad safe, we even discussed that it was clear that something was wrong and we needed to stop having sex for a while. If we’re good at one thing it’s communicating (: After that, every time he tried to speak sexually towards me I would cut him off and tell him to stop because it made me uncomfortable. He could tell I was withdrawing and he was clearly concerned about our relationship. 

Now, very very suddenly, the other day he started talking to me in a very sub-like manner, and I felt really tentative about it but it seemed genuine. Today he really submitted fully and it was amazing, such a relief for the both of us, so I’ve got some hope that this could work. He needed time to work through what he needed to in order to be okay with submission and it worked out. 
 I’m really glad that it did but I could also see it having turned out differently. I’m sure that submitting for a man comes with many struggles that women couldn’t understand because of societal pressure and that’s something to consider. I guess it’s up to you to decide how you go about it and everyone is different. This is my story. Maybe it’ll help in some way (:"

mentalhealth,fmo9ucz,t1_fmnrz3r,1586250906.0,"I honestly wouldn’t recommend a friend :/ a therapist 100% but it’s very very likely that a friend would think of it every time you’re around a child, or when they have their own child if they choose to do so. Some things other people just don’t need to know. SOMEONE knowing would be very very helpful though. Something like this coupled with therapy would be the best preventative measure that you can take and that you SHOULD take in my opinion. Invest in tackling this, it will help you and it will protect others. 

Having said that, there are alternative, safe, legal, and consensual ways of acting out your desires. I don’t know if you’ve ever looked into kink but there are people that engage in age play.

There’s stuff out there that would otherwise be illegal if not done in these controlled settings. Lots of people are into rape, it’s called consensual non consent (CNC). There are reasons that people do this stuff. Sometimes they’re working through trauma, other times they’re practicing it in a safe and consensual environment to satisfy their innate desires. Who knows, you could fall in love with a little (that’s what we call age players) and have a healthy and happy relationship.

People in the Kink scene are open to these things, it would probably be the best place to find that friend that won’t look at you differently for feeling this way.

If you put in the work then I think it’ll be okay. Best of luck OP"

mentalhealth,fmlbhzz,t3_fvvdq3,1586183027.0,"Same. I’ve been communicating with friends more since the lock down but I’m still not really one of those enthusiastic callers and texters. Open ended texts always put a lot of pressure on me because I’m expecting a response and I know I won’t want to text back. It’s something that I’ve accepted about myself though and all of my friends know that I’m like that. They don’t take it personally and I don’t feel bad about it anymore. In regards to the thing about adapting to others though, that’s totally natural to an extent. It’s one thing if you’re actively acting around people and are conscious of trying to be someone in particular, but it’s also true that we are multi-faceted beings. 

Different people bring out different parts of me and that’s one of the reasons I love humanity so much. It’s an opportunity to dive into myself in ways that I wouldn’t alone. I’m bipolar, I get depressed, and I go extended periods without talking to people. Days, months, years. My mom, and boyfriend are the only people I really talk to frequently but that’s okay.

BDSMAdvice,fmkkpdg,t3_fvt467,1586158316.0,"Hi OP (: 
I would say to start by talking to him and see if you guys agree on stuff that could be options in a scene. If you guys have already landed on some yeses and maybes, start with the yeses because being as certain as you can in the beginning is always your best bet. It’s important to start with new things slow so that you can feel it out and make it the best that it can be (: 

It could be awkward at first but that’s okay, new things often are. There are a whole bunch of little things that you can do to set a Domme mood. The heavy kink (breathplay, etc) can come later with more talk and more research to be as safe as possible. Some things that you could do is start off by saying “Are you ready to be my toy for the night?” You could tell him to get on his knees and give you oral while you stand. Small dominant things just to get you guys used to the role switch and get you in the mood.

I made a post with kinky games/sample scenes for kinky couples that I’ll link you to (: it could help to inspire and put some ideas in your head for stuff that you could do. I’m a Domme so it’s pretty Domme oriented but there are many that aren’t role specific, I like to switch as well.

sex,fmao80h,t1_fm7t2s7,1585901263.0,I almost forget what it feels like because it’s been so long and I’ve orgasmed twice from oral in the last 3.5 years so maybe I just don’t feel much either?... I know that I used to like it and it was my primary form of orgasm for many years with an old partner.. pretty sure... This shut down just has me horny and stressed 😣
sex,fmambx4,t1_fm8r9px,1585899208.0,"Erotica is far superior but I’ve never masturbated to a book, it sounds kinda strange haha"
sex,fm8a0i5,t1_fm81fp7,1585845575.0,"I’m a dominant woman and am very into kink but I don’t like femdom porn, or really any bdsm porn for that matter. Sometimes it’s totally out of the realm of what the person actually practices"

sex,fm83xu4,t1_fm83fx2,1585842351.0,"I’m sorry to hear that :/ I use vibrators during sex because I still want to cum with my partner so I kind of see it as him making me cum through the experience, even if it is the toy bringing me to climax. I think there may be a disproportionate amount of effort in the bedroom for us and it’s starting to be a problem, but in regards to using toys, there are plenty of women who cant cum without and that’s okay. As long as sex between two people is mutually satisfying then that’s good sex imo"

BDSMAdvice,fm75q51,t3_fthslk,1585814227.0,"It doesn’t really sound like you guys are kink compatible. Having said that, you guys just need to talk about it. If you’re leaning towards trying a dominant role then ask her what she’s fantasized about or what she likes as a little, then you can respond with what you might like to try. It will become a back and forth dialogue and then you guys will have some foundation to build on moving forward. As I’m sure you know, kink doesn’t work without talking through things first. Good luck (:"
sex,fm757gz,t1_fm6rm4e,1585813681.0,"Yes. This is it.

Edit: haha what’s up with the downvotes? Unpopular opinion I guess 🤷‍♀️"
sex,fm72vwu,t1_fm6zpmc,1585811277.0,"Same :/ and weirdly enough, with my current partner who seems to enjoy it somewhat, I can’t relax enough to really enjoy it the way I want to. It makes me sad. It didn’t used to be so hard, I used to LOVE it. My old partner and I were a very intense couple and we were very very active sexually. I went about 3.5 years in between him and my current bf without receiving oral because they were never into it which is really just the worst. Merh. Vibrators are my saving grace now and won’t even let myself imagine another way of getting off because it doesn’t really look like it’s in the cards for me right now."
sex,fm72ihd,t1_fm6yt93,1585810910.0,Wow. This somehow made SO much sense
BDSMerotica,fm71y43,t3_ftdtly,1585810358.0,"The Way of Kings is the coolest book ever, a friend on mine (the one that got me to read it) has read it 6+ times, and now my partner is reading it after I did. It’s a trilogy and each book is 1000 pages. Super fun fantasy (: I 100% recommend it"
FemdomCommunity,fm50tej,t1_fm4xl10,1585764222.0,"I’ve found that difference in height and how that affects the experience is most apparent with the Lyra (hoop) because of hoop size, and with the silks it’s balance because they’re not a solid apparatus. I’ve never done pole although it is on my bucket list. All of the aerial arts demand a lot of strength and balance, but generally from what I’ve seen height isn’t a huge factor. I did have a very very tall Lyra (hoop) classmate and she struggled somewhat with certain things because of it, and the same is true for being very short. Flexibility, on the other hand, plays a HUGE factor and it’s something that I’m constantly yelling at myself to work on when I’m in class. Everything looks better with splits and you can do so many more things with greater mobility but don’t let that hold you back. We all start somewhere (:"
