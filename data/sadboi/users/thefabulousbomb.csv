femalefashionadvice,fqtwfhl,t3_gkv2x8,1589647423.0,"I‚Äôm a very similar build to you, I‚Äôm a UK 8/10 but most of that is because of having wider shoulders, a bigger chest (34DD) and a bigger bum. My waist is actually tiny, and my wrists and ankles are tiny. I enjoy minimalist trends, and I love the idea of loose clothes and wearing nudes and whites, but everytime I do it I often end up looking bloated or 5 sizes bigger, which just makes me feel uncomfortable. 

My wardrobe is mostly colourful or black clothing, and if I wear culottes I tend to end up wearing a crop top or a tight top with them. I have exactly one pair of wide leg trousers and I rarely wear them without a waist trainer on because they cling so much to my stomach that it makes me look bigger (despite being very fit), and they cling to my bum and thighs rather than being loose so I always end up feeling like I have elephant legs. If I wear anything wide I always feel like I have to show off my ankles or something else to avoid looking oddly proportioned. I‚Äôve even noticed a rise recently in online stores often showing influencers who might have larger looking hips, but it‚Äôs often camera tricks, and they always have perfect hour glass waists. It‚Äôs so unrealistic to how the clothes look and it makes me feel awful. I mostly follow them to keep up with new trends, and also because they often use social media to promote discount codes (although I have recently got honey for this), and also for giveaways. I do follow a lot of brands that also show plus size models, and models with stretch marks or scars (dolls kill is one I love for this).

AskReddit,fqtj4rf,t3_gkmcs6,1589640023.0,"People often comment on the fact that I don‚Äôt do drugs of any kind, and that I don‚Äôt often drink, but no one ever actually asks me why.

The reality of it is that when I was 15 (nearly 16) I got my first period, and shortly after my 16th birthday I was hospitalised because they discovered I had an ovarian cyst. It was only 1.7CM so it was tiny, but it was inside my ovaries. Imagine shoving a pencil through a straw, now imagine the straw is your internal organs and the pencil is that cyst, very painful. So the doctors at the hospital just gave me co-dydramol, a strong painkiller, and just told me to take 2 every four to six hours. 

They basically just did this for a year, until I went back to my doctor for a new prescription and the doctor looked and explained to my mum that I never should have been given it in the first place, because it can be addictive. I was immediately taken off them, except they still did nothing about the pain I was in so I was taking paracetamol constantly. I then spent the next year having cameras put everywhere but my ovaries to find out why I was having problems with stomach pains, and when I was 18 they basically gave up and told me to just take painkillers. 

I was also suffering badly from depression and anxiety over this time anyway, and the painkillers they had me on were numbing that pain (because it just blocks things off), so I developed a crippling painkiller addiction. Then at 18 I was legally able to drink (UK), so I was on a combination of them both. 

Over the last 8 years I‚Äôve often gone back to those bad habits because they‚Äôre easy to do when I‚Äôm struggling to cope, when I tried to commit suicide unsing painkillers and alcohol, in January last year the paramedics were basically suprised I was even concious enough to talk to them because of the amount of painkillers I had taken (including an entire packet of night nurse tablets). My body has just build up such a tolerance for them over the years that I ended up saving myself, as I was alone when I did it and was able to call the ambulance myself. Since last year I‚Äôve stopped taking painkillers completely unless I‚Äôm severe pain. 

My SO knows all about these issues, and visited me in hospital daily when I was there, he now keeps the painkillers in a drawer away from me and if I ask for them he will give them to me, but he will also help me try other pain relief methods first. 

I‚Äôve also since been diagnosed with endometriosis, which is why I had the pain at 15/16 after my first period, and I was given therapy after the suicide attempt as I refused to be put on antidepressants (again), and I‚Äôve now actually been diagnosed with PTSD. I refuse drugs of any kind because regardless of what anyone says all drugs can be addictive, because they all block/release certain chemicals in your brain, and as someone who has fallen into that pit many times it‚Äôs way too easy to fall back into it."

Then I was only allowed very cheap clothes, it was ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù to buy a top that cost more than ¬£5. When I finally got boobs at 17 (after secondary school and the bullying), I was only allowed cheap bras because my parents controlled my money. Once I started controlling my own finances I changed my clothing budget, initially I ended up splurging and buying lots of cheap clothes, but as I got older I started buying from higher priced stores. In terms of underwear I started from Primark, then went to Ann Summers, then Boux Avenue, and now I tend to buy all my bras from Victoria‚Äôs Secret, and panties are from a mix of Victoria‚Äôs Secret (their panty sales are the best time to bulk buy), and Primark as they do some decent quality lace thongs.

My clothing is now mid range mostly, I have cleared out most of my wardrobe recently to fit this too. Staple items (t-shirts, camis, etc) I tend to buy from Primark or New Look, as they‚Äôre good cheaper items, but the fabric quality is soft and will tend to last a couple years. Jeans I tend to buy in the ¬£20-¬£30 budget though, I like New Look, and recently I‚Äôve been buying from Nasty Gal. Then I have a nice mixed budget for layers amd everything else. I tend to buy more expensive shoes though, as they last so much longer.

I do think that not having the money at a younger age has definitely helped me when it comes to shopping as I appreciate sales and discounts a lot more.

If it was short staffed he wouldn‚Äôt let anyone take breaks, when he should‚Äôve been covering their areas instead. I was on my 1st week at this job and the general manager wanted me trained on everything, so she put me on a morning shift with him to get me to learn the front desk. The idea being that a day shift was the easiest way to learn because it was quiet, so he could teach me it all properly. 

Instead he spent the whole time in the office and got annoyed when I asked for training, and only let me do the bar because I was already trained on that. Then because it was only me and him on shift he claimed we were short staffed and I couldn‚Äôt take a break. 

I reported it all to the general manager, as she‚Äôs a long term family friend anyway, and she made a note. Then a month later he accused another staff member of stealing drinks, because the staff member had done a short stint in prison (for dealing weed), I instantly defended the staff member because he just wouldn‚Äôt do it, and again reported it.

He made the worst mistake when a couple of weeks later I was off sick, because I had a cold and literally couldn‚Äôt talk, he forced me to call in sick because he refused to accept my texts. Then he complained when I couldn‚Äôt talk properly, then because another staff member also called in sick that night he refused to let anyone take breaks. They all reported it to the general manager, and someone reported it to HR. The next week we suddenly had a huge visit from head office and the regional managers, I wasn‚Äôt there but basically they walked in, spent 10 minutes in the office and when they left he left with them.

When I spoke to the general manager about it afterwards she said that she had been building a case for a while, because they also suspected he had been stealing but he was doing it in the blind spot of the office cameras, so they couldn‚Äôt fire him for it. In the end the tipping point was the shift where I was off sick as it was also reported that he signed everyone out for 1AM when they actually didn‚Äôt finish until 3AM. Most staff had started work at 4PM, so they had 11 hour shifts with no break and 2 hours pay docked (which they got back)."

I spotted it before anyone else and instantly got my colleague to call for security to come and help, I got the woman sat down and asked if she was okay, she was responsive and assured me that it would be over soon. Security arrived quickly and they were just giving her a check over, so I ended up keeping an eye on her kids to make sure they were okay, especially the older one as she was able to understand enough of the situation to panic about it. Afterwards the woman thanked me for helping and when we reported it to our higher ups (as the incident happened while she was in the queue) everyone gave me a ‚Äòwell done‚Äô, as my colleague didn‚Äôt even notice that she was having a fit until she was on the second one, and he had no idea what to actually do.

This lesson they all sat next to me, deliberately surrounding me, and the substitute teacher refused to make them move. After they were bullying me, asking me questions and then talking shit about my family I had enough enough so I stood up and told them to fuck off. One of them continued to be mouthy and I told him to stop or I would hit him, he was shocked when I did hit him. The teacher obviously saw all the commotion, and tried to make me leave, for standing up for myself. I refused to go, because they were 3 boys bullying me (a very short skinny girl), one of them was already the tallest boy in school and he was wide too. The teacher then said I was disrupting the class by not leaving, so I pointed to everyone working. This went on for about 20 minutes and she ended up getting the headteacher to remove me from the class, despite her ignoring me asking them to move, and explaining to her the normal seating chart because they bullied me. She wanted me to get suspended for talking back, and she wanted to give me detention.

In the end the headteacher spoke to me, listened to my side of the story, also knowing I was bullied and thankfully knowing that the 3 boys were trouble makers anyway.
