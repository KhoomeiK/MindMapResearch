mentalhealth,fm8ree8,t3_ftrqht,1585854608.0,"Rooting for you to get your life back on track, brother. I can literally relate what you're going through right now. Due to the depression and physical abused I had when I was younger, turn me into a socially awkward weirdo where all I kept thinking was to just kill myself or run away to get a away from this pain. I dropped out in college years ago and after improving myself mentally, my goal now is to get back to my studies as well. 

I'm now 24 years old and for years after seeing my friends graduating, it made me feel depressed and embarrassed. But you know what? I realised it's never too late to finish school. Push forward to make a better life for yourself my friend. I wish you luck."
mentalhealth,fm8pki3,t3_ftrxle,1585853652.0,"Don't be like that, buddy. Keep your chin up and keep on fighting until you win. Killing yourself is never the answer my friend. All of us will always have bad days in our lives but you always gotta keep moving forward to climb out of the hole. I promise you things will get better, just don't give up. There are days where I feel that too but I can't quit now cause I'll never know what's in store for me in the future if I just keep on pushing forward and stay positive in life."
mentalhealth,fm8o556,t3_ftqnzu,1585852916.0,"Not to sound cold when it comes to this but I had this experience before with my ex. She threatened to kill herself if I left her. I literally didn't care if she does it because I told her that's a petty thing to do and unfair to put someone in a situation like that and turn you into a hostage in the relationship. She didn't do it though cause I knew she wouldn't do anything stupid like that. Don't make yourself miserable if you're no longer happy in your relationship. 

The point is. Just completely cut him off until reality kicks him it was his fault for losing you. The moment he can't get in touch with you, he'll cut the bullcrap and learn to man-up and accept the break up. 

Depression is not a simple thing to get rid off cause I've been there before. Yes, some people need help getting over depression but in reality, it never really goes away. It's a battle of overcoming it and only you can defeat the demons inside your head."

Philippines,flyiuos,t3_frun91,1585602970.0,Facts: Life ain't a fairy tale. There are probably millions to billions of people who have suffered and died in the past unfairly. It just shows that reality is a cruel harsh world. You'll either need to adapt from it or perished like many have before.
