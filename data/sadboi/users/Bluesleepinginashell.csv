I don't think so, I don't know, I have gone through more than 5 psychologists and they all seem like idiots to me, the psychiatrist who is treating me is also an incompetent asshole, but reading the symptoms of both disorders the coincidences are many, that overwhelm me, just because sometimes  I see/hear things doesn't mean I have it, right? or I immediately enter into the spectrum"

Ever since I was diagnosed, I have wondered if the things I see or hear really exist or are paranoid because I come from a country strongly attached to the Catholic Church, very superstitious of witches and spirits or if it's a product of my disorder.

I also returned my steps and analyzed every relationship I have had, wondering if my feelings are/were real, why I stayed in abusive relationships and also when did I became a shitty person."
