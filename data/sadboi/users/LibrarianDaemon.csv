chicago,fmgu78u,t3_fuxis1,1586057944.0,"Transcript:

We've built a forecasting tool here at Rush.

We've been using it for our planning, we also made it publicly available, so anybody in the country can use it.

And we've been using this to forecast actually how many beds we may need.

There's two types of patterns that we've been seeing nationally, one that have to do with how fast there's growth, what is called exponential growth, and what exponential growth is, every few days, the number of cases double.

And so the actual number increase goes up over time.

So if you have two death cases today, you end up with four cases in about two to three days is what New York is seen, for example, every between two and three days.

In the past, they weren't having doubling of cases.

What happens though, is if that ends up generating really large numbers really quick.

So if you have 1000 cases today, in two days, you'll end up with 2000 cases.

And so it's really hard for hospital to handle huge volumes that increase day after day, there's a second type of growth, which is called quadratic growth.

And the name isn't as important.

But what it means is the rate of change isn't so fast, it's a little bit slower, how quickly things get worse, or how quickly cases increase.

And the good news is in Illinois, while we initially were on that exponential growth path, it's feeling more and more like we're on that other path, which is not as fast growth, it's still there.

Quadratic growth, it's still there that it goes up, but it's not as rapid as exponential growth.

So we may see that our cases double every 10 days or every six days, what where that's really important is, as we have patients coming in the hospital, we have time to help them improve, let them be discharged, and then make beds available for for additional patients to come.

So there's early evidence that there that we have flattened the curve.

And so this is on the left hand side.

These are general medical floors.

And on the right hand side, these are the ICUs.

And what you can see is that the yellow line is what we forecast for our exponential growth model.

And the red line is what we forecast with our quadratic growth model.

And we've, we were kind of rising in our general medical floor beds, but we've just started stabilizing and we might be declining.

And in our ICU bed use, we're still going up, but it's below our forecasts for this polynomial growth.

So meaning, we're growing, but we're not growing as fast as the worst case scenario, really with the timeframes.

This really does seem like this is the statewide on shelter-at-home taking effect, but we're starting to feel maybe that this will, we'll start to see a peak soon, maybe in the next week, and we'll start to see a decline.

We are like the way China has been in Singapore and South Korea, we'll see a continuing decline until there may actually be very few new cases.

And that may take several, several weeks to a month or two, we do think there's going to be potentially a second wave.

And so I'm Scott Gottlieb, who was the former head of the FDA.

A few other folks who have nationally been speaking on this, feel like there might be an outbreak in the southern hemisphere that will come and then that will get spared at that time, but then it will come back in the fall.

And we'll start to see cases here in the us again, what we hope is that by that time, we'll have experience on how to keep this under control.

You know, we really stood up a lot of change over about three weeks, we'll have a little bit more time to be thoughtful and plan very carefully, how we do our entire scope of operations and Potentially not become fully focused on coven, manage coven while we do other things.

And then the other part of it is, we're starting to think about treatments and vaccines.

There's a vaccine trial, there's several actually that are going on right now.

And hopefully by later this year, we'll have some really good results.

In addition, there's a number of treatment trials that Russia is participating in, that may be other things that we can really use and have some data behind it.

So I think we'll be in a very different place in the fall if there were to be an increase in cases.

Again, I think we're really well positioned in the research side of things.

We have a group through the university that's been flagging every potential trial and research opportunity.

And we have a number of investigators applying for funding and we have a really well characterized database and by repository plan so we can participate in those trials.

And I think from the standpoint of how we look at the fall and how we're positioned for them, I think we're in a really good position."
