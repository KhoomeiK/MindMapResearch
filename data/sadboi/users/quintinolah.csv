SuicideWatch,fm39a9a,t3_fsmc3h,1585716326.0,You're living a meaningful life.  You also need a break.   Make it priority to eat and sleep and keep connected to loved ones through social media and phone calls.
Advice,fkwf2vj,t3_fl2ud5,1584590698.0,"Have you tried getting regular exercise or play some sort of physical sports? It can be a great way to release all that energy from your pent up anger.   Also, are you eating enough food and getting enough sleep? 

It may be harder to control our emotions when the body is not in shape and lacking nutrition and rest, this may cause hormonal imbalances.  Before you consider psychological interventions, take care of your physical health better; or do it alongside.  

Having some people to talk with can also be great help instead of burying your emotions until it explodes.  I found talk therapy helpful.  At times when nobody is available, you may try online mental health support groups and counselling.  If you find typing things out as you did here, you may also try making journaling a habit, just pour it all out on your writing... Then maybe throw away what you wrote on paper with all that negative energy and shame, and burn it if you like."
Advice,fkwbh48,t3_fl0njw,1584588031.0,"Nobody is ""just lazy"".  Laziness is just a symptom of either poor physical health or inner well being, or both.

The physical aspect could be easier to deal with so you may want to start with that.  Underlying inner/psychological issues also may be easier to resolve if your mind and body runs with proper nutrition.

Feeling lazy/tired means you lack bodily energy.  It does not necessarily mean you need more carbs or energy foods.  More often it is a lack in vitamins and minerals.  The cause can be different for different people, usually a lack in iron, magnesium, potassium, and certain B vitamins. Improper nutrition can also lead to hormonal imbalances and mental health problems associated with laziness.

Check your diet, ask yourself what you usually eat and not eat.   If you do a lot of physical activity and overtime work, you body might need more of almost every kind of nutrient.  Lack in exercise can also lead to poor blood circulation and feeling lazy.

By eating too much processed and junk foods, you may feel full but not get enough nutrition your cells need to manufacture and conserve energy.  In my experience, I also feel lazy when I eat too much food, especially oily foods."

Contact relatives/friends and your country's enforcers for better knowledge where the tenant would best relocate. The building should also be more thoroughly cleaned after the infected tenant has left.
