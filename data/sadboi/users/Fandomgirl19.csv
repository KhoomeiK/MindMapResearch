JamesBond,fqx5in2,t3_gfsj7x,1589726268.0,"Imo I think that the only good thing about Spectre is that Bond was good (Daniel Craig plays him really well in all the films though). The Bond Girl wasn't *terrible* but she wasn't as great as some past bond girls. The brother plot twist was absolutely terrible, however. It just dragged the film down and made Blofeld seem petty and less than he has been made out to be throughout the franchise. Spectre could have been more likeable and a better film without this semi brother shit. The first part of the film was enjoyable, but after arriving at the crater hq the only thing that was good was Craig's acting. Also annoying that Bond girl supposed to be strong and able to stand up for herself got captured. Twice."

Also, being a youtuber isn't the most stable job, but the labrants have a huge following so I doubt they'll go down soon. It'll be more of a gradual downfall.

However, many videos include Posie going to the emergency room for trivial things like her throwing up or having a cough. I'm not saying that sickness in babies isn't serious, hell, I almost died when I was one from what my parents thought was a common cold. But to film your ill baby and then make the situation sound worse than it is to your young, impressionable followers who care about the wellbeing of your baby is such a shitty thing to do.

There are many pictures of Ev, her father and her fathers new partner Courtney, and they just do cute family things like picnics and beach days and movie nights.

Cole is definitely in way over his head. Although I believe what he says about loving Posie is genuine and he really does love his child, I think that Cole has started to despise his cushy happy family set up, and I don't think he truly loves Savannah. I think he fell in love with the idea of being able to exploit the situation of his wife already having a child and being their saviour. That being said, I don't think Savannah truly loves him either. If anything I think it's a little creepy that her boyfriend was 19. But yes. I think Cole definitely was happier before Posie was born, and I think the burden of children at such a young age is taking a toll. Don't get me wrong, children arent a burden, but Cole will probably be a father to seven children at 30, and I think he is bitterly regretting it."

Honestly these names are setting their children up for bullying. The Labrants are so narcissistic, they name their children the strangest names. I cannot imagine Posie going to school without getting picked on for her name. They named her after a nickname that her mother had. Can you think of anything more selfish on behalf of her parents? A name is something you carry for your entire life, and the Labrants name their children as if they can be discarded after they are too old to play dolls for Savannah."
LaBrantFamSnark,fpgen01,t3_g6qken,1588601137.0,"Bit late but nvm. Savannah is so narcissistic that she wants to pass her narcissistic behaviour onto her children. Poor Everleigh. Although I don't agree with it I understand why parents dress the same with their young children, to feel close with their baby, even if it is a little weird. Imo parents matching with children should be stopped at around 3-4 years old at most. I understand why parents dress their children the same, they love them equally and want them to match. But this isnt Savannah's mindset. She wants her children to be like her because she loves herself so much. I don't have a problem with parents dressing their children the same when they are younger, however Everleigh is six years older than Posie and probably feels a embarrassed matching her baby sister. She probably feels even more embarrassed matching her mother. Savannah is obsessed with the term 'mini me'. She isnt your mini me, Savannah. She is her own individual person who is too old to be your doll anymore."

LaBrantFamSnark,fpg8gyn,t3_gd3kcg,1588597091.0,"I'm probably wrong but I feel Maddison is probably prone to post-partum depression. Twin toddlers can't be easy and a one year old is a feat on it's own. Savannah talked Maddison into having a fourth child so they could be pregnant at the same time. Maddison was basically pressured into being pregnant. I'm not sticking up for Maddison here but it has been easy for Savannah kid-wise. Everleigh earned her money and fame, which earned her a 'good Christian boyfriend', which earned her a baby which earned her more fame. In other ways, Savannah hasn't earned bollocks. Savannah has a seven year old and a one year old. Maddison has twin three years olds and a 14 month baby. Savannah wanted to get pregnant together for the image, and Maddison agreed. I bet anything shes bitterly regretting it now, especially when she gets absolutely no help from her man-child husband. Back to the original point, Maddison is in no position to have a fourth baby, she cant take care of her current one. And her twins are nightmares, although I hate to talk about children. All they do is pose for photos and behave badly, and she bangs on about dressing them up like dolls. Maddison's children are dolls to her. She isnt capable of taking care of them on her own, and her husband probably makes things worse."
LaBrantFamSnark,fpg78ml,t3_gd5bvc,1588596180.0,"Honestly I cannot believe how Savannah talked him into having children so young. Becoming a 'father' to Everleigh was one thing, having two children before the age of 24 is a completely different thing. Children with age gaps that close are a nightmare, and you don't have to be a parent to know that. Cole is way in over his head. Having Posie was one thing, and even when he asked to wait until she was two before having a second baby, here he is with a wife due before his daughter's second birthday. I also think having his biological children has definitely affected his relationship with Everleigh. I've watched a couple of their old videos and a couple newer ones, just to see how they acted on camera. Cole and Everleigh used to have actually quite a cute bond, and although Savannah was and always has been an annoying, superficial, personality vacuum, C & E genuinely seemed to have a good relationship. I think having a biological child opened Cole's eyes. He could preach no end about taking in Everleigh and loving her as his own, but when he had his own child he realised how easy it is to subconsciously love your own child more than your stepchild. It's natural human instinct, but nevertheless it makes Cole a dick. In newer videos Cole is constantly being demeaning and rude with Everleigh. I think that Everleigh, who looks fed-up with having her every move filmed, will probably live with her dad when shes older. Good for her. Her dad's just a normal guy who loves his kid. However, this will definitely affect Cole and Savannah's image. Everleigh is the only reason Savannah gained fame in the first place. Cole is very much under his wife's thumb and a self-absorbed narcissist. He doesnt really want Everleigh now he has his own 'perfect' children. Although he would never admit it due to the terrible way it would portray him, he clearly has some sort of deeply-rooted problem with Everleigh being a 'sin born outside of marriage'. He cant fully accept her because she is living proof of his wife's inability to bring her holy virginity to the marriage bed. Cole married too young, had children too young, and now is living a life he will be bored of a few years and many children later. I for one can't wait to see what happens. He's a dickhead and tbh he deserves what's coming."

They robbed a little girl of a normal childhood and yet when she is old enough to do something about it they'll probably blame her father for still being in the picture.

Eleven and Clara were good together, but something about Twelve and Clara made me feel like they weren't as good together, not to mention Clara became a lot less likeable in season eight, (sorry, just my opinion if you liked her). Although Danny didn't stand in the way at first, it ultimately came down to the decision of Clara choosing between him and the Doctor, which Danny imposed upon her. I just feel the show would have done so much better without him."
doctorwho,fln2171,t1_flltgce,1585306189.0,"Oh it's not that I think he's offensive, it's that I purely hate how much he embodies everything Doctor Who shouldn't be. He constantly spoke against the Doctor, and although Twelve was a bit of a dick in some episodes, I hated anyone speaking against him. I've been a huge Doctor Who fan for years, and it just annoyed me so much to see this self-impressed ex-soldier come in and basically try to turn Clara against the Doctor."
doctorwho,fllpxvc,t1_fllptuz,1585265370.0,Do you like him or just simply not care?
doctorwho,flln274,t1_flj6ih5,1585263704.0,"Also the Doctor's jealousy of Danny Pink. Could just be because Danny is an absolutely terrible character, but also because of their past history."
doctorwho,fllmr1e,t1_flkxowh,1585263524.0,"THANK YOU. Danny was terrible. The actor and actress didn't even have chemistry, which is yet another reason why the Danny/Clara relationship was so unbelievable and unlikeable. I completely agree with everything you've said. Had Eleven and Clara stayed together longer and left together it would have made Clara so much more likeable and season eight watchable, (I'm sorry if anyone likes season eight I just hate it so much). Apparently Moffat didn't want to repeat the Rose storyline with her falling in love with the Doctor and promising to travel with him forever, but he could have had a storyline of a romantic/suggesting of romance relationship between Eleven and Clara with a different energy of that to Ten and Rose, and let's be honest, Clara probably would have been killed off either way. However, there was ways to repeat the storyline without actually 'repeating' the storyline. But he instead traded it for the horrible, really unhealthy-seeming relationship between Danny and Clara."
doctorwho,flkhs2s,t3_foy4aj,1585241174.0,"I loved Eleven and Clara. I thought they were really cute and funny and adorable. Matt Smith and Jenna Coleman had really great chemistry and that also sold the story I think Moffat was trying to touch upon, that it was basically a repeat of the Doctor and Rose - The Doctor coming from a really dark place in his life and meeting a woman who could match his wits and taking her through space with him. One of my biggest regrets however, (and one of Matt Smith's apparently), is that they only had half a season together. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Ponds and they are absolutely amazing, but saying that, they left extremely big shoes for Clara to fill. So coming into such a big franchise just after two of the most popular characters were leaving and trying to take their place, it must've been tough. That wasn't a problem for David Tennant and Billie Piper, as she was staying on and although Christopher Eccleston did an amazing job as the Doctor, many people didn't immediately latch onto Nine and fell in love with Ten immediately. When Eleven left, I feel that Clara got a whole lot more dislikable. I absolutely loved her in season seven, and then it was if she was replaced by this alternate, more annoying, more stupid version of Clara. And purely because of one reason. Danny Pink. I HATED Danny Pink from the second I saw him, so much to the point that when I rewatch Doctor Who I pretend season eight doesn't exist. Danny was so unlikeable, so nit-picky, just the embodiment of what Doctor Who shouldn't be. I hated how he constantly spoke against the Doctor, tried to make Clara choose, and constantly brought up the fact he was an ex-soldier, using it as an excuse for practically everything. He treated Clara as if she shouldn't be allowed to travel with the Doctor purely because she was his girlfriend. They were such a terrible match. I honestly could never imagine someone like Clara with such a pathetic, idiotic dickhead. They were just shoved together to provide a potential exit for Coleman, who changed her mind at the last second anyway and opted to stay another season. Back to the original question, Eleven and Clara were amazing and extremely underappreciated, and when Eleven left Clara became unlikeable and annoying."
