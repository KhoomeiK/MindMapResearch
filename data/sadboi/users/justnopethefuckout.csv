AskReddit,fpuf4nx,t3_gffps6,1588911348.0,"A group of popular rich kids said I was going to shoot up the school. I would never say that.

This was a long time ago. We moved constantly. I was bullied often and that morning was no different. I was used to it though. Later on in class I got called to the office and was told everything that had been said. I started crying. I figured they wouldn't believe me that I didn't say it. Some people were called in as well. 

Want to know what saved me? My science teacher. She came in once she heard and put her job on the line that I never said it and never would do something like that. That woman cried for me. She said she knew the kids bullied me and others. She really went all out for me. Said I was a great student and very kind. My record in school was clean. I hadn't even had detention at that point yet, at any school. That helped, but she honestly saved me. Apparently when talking to the other students again the story was a little off as well. I still ended up with ISS. Science teacher volunteered to be the one who stayed with me. I was honestly so happy to be stuck with her. I found out she had been bullied a lot growing up and that's what got to her.

Some people believed I said it. Others didn't. I would never even joke about that. This was definitely before the US had a lot of bad school shootings, but it still wasn't something I found funny. My home life was hard enough. I kept my head down. I didn't want to bother anyone.

I hope no one ever pulls something like that on another student. That really could've fucked me up long term. I remember walking down the hall and hearing a girl say, that's the girl who said she's going to shoot up the school. I cried. I cried a lot over that. I pray my science teacher knows I was so thankful for her. I also hope she stills knows I never said that."
