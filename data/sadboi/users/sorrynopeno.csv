AbrahamHicks,ev9n550,t1_ev8o3rw,1564326252.0,"Have you read any of the books?  I just finished The Vortex and it has a very very clear explanation that‚Äôs easy to understand. 

We aren‚Äôt denying the negative emotions or experiences. We accept that we‚Äôre co-creating everything in our reality. I we want something different than what is, we have to give more attention to what we want than what we don‚Äôt want (negative). 

I can speak first hand on this. Depression, anxiety, panic & anxiety attacks, suicidal ideation, an abusive marriage. Those things were completely consuming me, every minute of my day. And no it was not like I flipped a switch and decided to think positive and my life was amazing. It‚Äôs definitely not like that. However once you decide that what you‚Äôre doing isn‚Äôt moving the needle, in fact things were getting worse every day, you‚Äôll do anything to stop that momentum. 

I started with meditation, those few minutes of clearing my thoughts of everything. Sometimes it was only 30 seconds I could shut it down but it was 30 more seconds than I had the day before. And the next time it was a full minute, and so on and so on. Today I stop and meditate whenever I choose and can get in the zone in a second. Mindfulness techniques are amazing throughout your day, connecting to the present moment. 

Sometimes we try to make LOA more woo woo than necessary.  It‚Äôs rather simple. The past is gone, I cannot do one thing about my mistakes or the mistakes of others so why would I waste another minute ruminating on it? Tomorrow isn‚Äôt even here yet, why am I spending so much energy worrying about it. Now is now, I want to be here NOW in my most joyful happiness fullest self. When I am, the rest falls together."

Married almost 18 years. I had 3 kids when we met and he was the first person I orgasmed with. At the time I thought it was almost a miracle. I‚Äôve had 3 kids, been divorced and not once had an orgasm with another person in the room. 

It wasn‚Äôt him though, it was all the love bombing and how he made me feel which I now know was fake!  He truly wasn‚Äôt interested in my pleasure though he made it seem like he was. He was only interested in how I made HIM feel. My pleasure was only about how accomplished and amazing it meant he was. Not about me feeling good for the sake of me feeling good. 

The sex quickly deteriorated. I can‚Äôt go into details because I haven‚Äôt even processed most of it but coercion and abuse is top of the list.  I remember the look on his face and the tone of his voice the last time we had mutual masturbation (because I‚Äôve not let him touch me since February, in fear of my health). I had a great O and he said ‚ÄúLooks like I‚Äôve been replaced‚Äù about my vibrator.

I routinely wake between 3:30-4:30 and nearly always have panic attack before I‚Äôve gotten 1/4 cup of coffee down. Normal, not normal? I think it‚Äôs relative. I‚Äôm starting to notice that my awareness of it has been helpful though, knowing my brain, body and emotional habits of you will. 
I listen to a guided meditation when falling asleep every night now, work on be present and mindful the second my eyes open and just sitting or stretching a minute. That doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt still panic but I can calm myself quicker when I can be more aware. 

I wish you some success and calm in your mornings, I know how upsetting it is starting your day that way."
Anxiety,eob6t7k,t1_eoav395,1558436330.0,"If it helps, I‚Äôm new to severe anxiety. I‚Äôve probably had the normal healthy variety of having conversations in my head that I know will never happen irl the majority of my adult life. I don‚Äôt remember much of my childhood. I also regularly talked to myself in what I discovered was normal and even considered helpful. 

Since the anxiety hit hard that‚Äôs all changed. I don‚Äôt talk to myself anymore like I did. For example, I would work out solutions during work (work alone) or problem solve, reminde myself of things I need to do etc.  I‚Äôm silent now. But I‚Äôm having full conversations with people that I‚Äôve been hurt by, some were 20+ years ago, things I‚Äôve never processed. Like you mentioned, lips moving but almost under my breath while still being audible. It was upsetting when I first noticed it. I‚Äôm in my head a lot, alone 90% of the time, no outlet for those feelings. 
I agree it‚Äôs definitely an anxiety response. If I couldn‚Äôt look back at 43 years of my own history I may not be so sure but I know what I‚Äôm going through rn and #%?! It‚Äôs been hell. 

I don‚Äôt have suggestions other than yep, same.  You‚Äôre not alone."
