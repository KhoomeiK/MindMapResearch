AskReddit,ez7s9td,t3_d01cnb,1567727740.0,"My friend/coworker  wanted me to go to a concert with her I really didn’t want to go to. I texted her to explain my plans this weekend as to why I cannot go, and apologized for being a bad friend. Now she won’t respond to me and when she was she was extremely short with her responses. So I guess maybe I fucked up a good friendship?"

The amount of fear I get when I get to a party and someone says, “I made it gluten free so you can eat it!” Is unreal. I have to ask everything they used, if they used the same utensils on other food items, and so on..."
