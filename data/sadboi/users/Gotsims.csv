ADHD,fr0ngve,t1_fr0mcha,1589801580.0,"For me it helps a lot to have a variety of study techniques. It also helps to plan your studies in a planner. Even if you fall behind in my xp you end up doing more than if you hadn’t planned. You can also push yourself and catch up pretty fast. I personally need a lot of variety and stimulation to stay focused. I also need to exercise frequently to keep my brain functioning normally. I’ve come to realize I’m a visual and audial learner who learns by creating associations with the material I need to learn. So I do the following:

-Find what is most important to know. Might seem obvious but it’s rly easy to forget and overcommit to studying stuff that doesn’t really matter. Keep checking instructions, syllabuses, and asking teachers about what is most important to know. You can save yourself a lot of pointless work this way and get better marks by really zoning in on what is being examined by the teachers.

-buy fun stationery. No really. Pretty pens, stickers, nice looking notebooks and washi tape are my saving grace. If I get high from looking at my notes I am more likely to revisit them. I make every page as artistic succinct and inspired as I can.

- Probably one of the most powerful tools in my arsenal is reading my materials aloud and recording them using my phone’s memo function. This way I can replay them a million times while going out for a walk or sitting on the bus. It’s a really underrated way of making knowledge stick. There’s actual scientific research that shows our brain’s ability to soak knowledge improves substantially when we listen to audio while exercising. Maybe you have a chapter of a book or two you could play while running? I study a language, so for me the clips are never long enough to play during a run. It gets too fiddly to press play repeatedly on snippets of text, or textbook exercises. For a more literary subject with big chunks of text I can see this being even more handy though.

-study with friends. Accountability is key! It can be so good for morale to work next to friends, even if it poses a potential distraction. Use a timer to shut everyone up, do half an hour at a time and insist on silence, then time a break (say 10 minutes) where you can chit chat and pour coffee etc. 

-in general I think my timer is highly valuable because the the alarm going off /while/ I study prompts me to take breaks, as well as jolts me awake if I zone out or lose focus/ do something unrelated to work. It’s like a nanny that drags me back from the playground over to my desk. I like to keep my planner on hand and combine it with my timer to record what I’ve done in my day. That makes me hold myself accountable for and see time I waste on stuff that is unrelated, and lets me give myself credit for the hard work I actually get done.

-o yah. Also, use youtube. Use google. They can sometimes teach things better than your reading material and teachers. Sometimes it just helps to have things explained in several ways by several sources. (Be aware of sources though. Not all of them are reliable! So be critical when you use the net.)

Those are my main tricks, there are probably more things I could add but I would probably end up writing a book. (And that’s something I’d wanna capitalize on as a dirt poor university student lol)

Another thing is that I’m hardly a model student. I work pretty dang hard but still only get the bare minimum done for a lot of my classes because I don’t have access to meds anymore and I’ve been dealing with a lot of difficult life stuff. Like, I’m perpetually just scraping by when my classes don’t interest me deeply. ( Which is most of them, unfortunately. )

That’s a fuckload of grit and a lot of hard work they just did.) is that all nighters and going at it for a dozen hours on end might seem practical sometimes because you’re operating on adrenaline, and that tends to work for us adhders very well. That being said, it’s really unsustainable practice. Exhaustion actually negativity affects your ability to concentrate and memorize things, and hormones like adrenaline and cortisol are just not very good for your body to be too flooded with. It can lead to serious burnout.

 So while it’s awesome that you have tons of inner strength, it would be smarter in the long run to focus that energy into working a little bit at a time.

I didn’t assert my idea as the absolute truth, it’s a working hypothesis. But it’s one that isn’t entirely dismissed in the psychological community.

It’s difficult to prove conclusively but it’s worth considering as another facet of managing one’s so called disability. Sometimes our bodies are in high gear and dissociating (daydreaming) a lot, or seeking powerful stimulation due to emotional numbing, and those are often signs of greater prior difficult experiences in life. Sometimes ones we can’t even remember.

It’s not nonsense, it’s a lifetime’s worth of both self assessment and socializing with people like myself. It’s also years of learning how to function better in this standardized neurotypical geared system.

There’s always a genetic component, a part that is unchangeable, your personality. But to erase complex trauma’s role in concentration difficulties and restlessness is foolhardy in my opinion. Fight flight freeze or fawn response is exactly the kind of thing adhd intersects with much of the time. Particularly the flight (hyperactivity) and freeze (dissociation)."

raisedbynarcissists,fm3vedd,t1_fm3cfzk,1585738457.0,"What I look for on first dates is someone inspired by life and eager to have a good time with me and actually get to know me. Someone who knows how to communicate honestly and isn’t a coward. As a woman I also get reeally skeptical of a man who won’t at least offer to pay the bill on the first date, nay first few dates. Considering that women are still paid less in every country in the world, and that we are expected to spend more time, effort and money on our appearance to be deemed attractive in almost every country ever, it seems fair to me. It also is attractive to me to have a man already step up to the role of a supportive provider. Which is something I feel is being done when he pays for my drink or food. Assuming he isn’t an ass who expects to be paid back in some form and does it conditionally, I think it’s really very attractive to do that. I would say it’s very rare that a girl is such a prideful and un-critically thinking feminist that she’s downright insulted by such a gesture. (If she is then she’s probably too black and white in her mindset to be a healthy partner anyway.)

I don’t tend to be that impatient about attraction. What I don’t stand for however is saying yes to dates with people that I haven’t even a modicum of initial attraction to from the get go. That’s no good either. I don’t want to have to will myself into finding a person interesting. 
Appearance is obviously not everything, as I spent a small essay explaining in my other reply, but it’s something that I think both I and my partner ought to care about maintaining quite well every day that we aren’t home sick in bed. Not just for each other, but for the sense of magic and grandeur it can bring to an otherwise mundane existence. It’s the type of magic I want my life to be imbued with.
Might be the symptom of being from a family full of artists and being one myself. Or it’s my mother’s aristocratic background manifesting in me, but I am personally someone who places great importance on stylishness as well as good hygiene. It’s a sign of respect for both oneself and the public to want to be pleasing to the eyes in terms of aesthetics.

raisedbynarcissists,fm3unt0,t1_fm3cfzk,1585737679.0,"I’m not immune to being excited by novelty lol, I still get turned on by the ambiguities of a person I don’t know too well. I guess maybe I’m just getting old, and I feel more resistant to that sort of thing the more I date. Because people you have instant initial attraction to rarely turn out to be what they seem.

Maybe this hypothesis is a stretch, but:

I would argue that outside of genuine known personality of a target of affection, most people who claim instant attraction to strangers are attracted to some level of illusory appeal. 

Outside of the human body’s olfactory response to pheromones and features like healthy genes and a strong physique...

Whether its people claiming love at first sight or thinking a person they just met is hot... 

There’s a huge level of assumption factoring into the way we feel attraction. 

Most of the people claiming to have a type might just be turned on by assumptions and associations their brain carries subconsciously. 

For classic example: women who are drawn to rich men tend to gravitate that way based on certain pre established beliefs both about themselves and the other person. The first belief being that their own appearance and sexuality is a better path to success and comfort than an attempt at a career of their own. The second belief is that a rich man will lend his resources and status to her if she does what he wants to a certain extent.

Other classic example: People at large, but often straight men who are sexually attracted to appearances that are pre established as a beauty ideal by mainstream society. Ideas of what is objectively attractive vary quite impressively throughout time and geographically. One has only to venture beyond the globalized world influenced by media from the last hundred years. I heard of an African culture that view fatness as highly desirable in women. Other cultural groups on that continent which have been relatively unchanged by modernized society value features such as a long neck and stretched earlobes. Even in Europe alone, beauty ideals compared between baroque, the 1950s and the 2000s all vary tremendously, and have microcosms of their own existing together in the same time period.  If we’re talking women alone: You can’t compare wraithlike runway beauty with the curvaceous likes of pin ups of yore. 

Moving back to my point, a lot of people who have a type are operating on biases without realizing it. The primary bias may be the idea that a partner who fits social expectations of attractiveness (both physically and mentally) will advance our status and therefore contribute to our future comfort and happiness. 
If your boyfriend looks like a Hollywood actor, the assumption is that people are going to treat him like one, and by extension treat you like one.
Another assumption might be that he takes great care of his hygiene and grooms thoroughly at all times. 
Let’s postulate now that you’re a few months into the relationship, your beau feels like he’s got you and sealed the deal. Say he’s actually a real jackass who’s been pretending, he lets go of himself pretty much entirely in terms of grooming, stops exercising, and stops eating right. He turns to a mess. Your assumptions have effectively played you for a fool in some sense, because you didn’t truly know the person that well.

I like the word you used, “novelty”. 
I don’t know that people are hot for novelty itself as much as they are for the ability to pretend that their partner is a certain type of idealized person based off of that novelty. Although I suppose there’s an element of excitement at new possibilities that comes with a new person that makes the new-ness itself the attractive thing in question.

I can bust out more examples, but hopefully you already understand what I’m getting at. 
People who are immature, inexperienced, dislike commitment for personal reasons, or sometimes just plain not that smart, are most predisposed to behavior of this nature, where they confuse the initial stirrings of infatuation (which are feelings based on assumptions about a person, and your horny brain filling out empty gaps in knowledge with idealized ideas about a person. All based on face value knowledge.)

That, coupled with my cptsd and my “virginity” is why I have largely lost the ability to be super convinced by first impressions of people, and by extension don’t often feel that big of a desire to fuck with anyone who appears to be attractive upon initial meeting. 
Maybe I’m just horribly boring and cautious, I don’t know. 😆"
raisedbynarcissists,fm22du5,t1_fm1ywz7,1585689364.0,"You’re so welcome! Glad that came across.

An interesting question to be sure. Assuming the question “Do you want to date” was aimed at me and not rhetorical: The answer is, it depends on the day. Most of the time, the answer is yes. 

I want to find someone I love deeply, and find so sexy, that I would even go through the ordeal of putting together a wedding with them, and exchange rings with. Maybe even do the whole horrid meet the family thing with. That’s one of my life’s greatest desires. (To be in a long term romantic relationship I mean, not making my partner meet my family... For obvious reasons.)

I don’t care at all for tinder culture or clubbing anymore, as I have very rarely met anyone interesting that way or had any truly positive experiences with strangers. Most of them have been either creepy, boring, or desperate.

That being said I find my interest in dating really peaks when I meet somebody who excites and interests me. That’s also when I get horniest lol. It’s a big part of why I’ve come to identify as demisexual.  I simply am not interested in anything too shallow or face value, it’s not the type of person I am.  I need to vibe with people at least a solid bit before going down a physical path with them.

My sex drive can vary in correspondence with my menstrual cycle on its own, as well as my mood and health. Ie. I feel a lot more sexual and also all around vivacious as a person when I’m sleeping well, exercising, eating right, etc. That type of healthy self loving energy likely also makes people more interested in me, and ends up with me more likely to get tangled up in infatuation. Loving yourself breeds confidence, which is one the sexiest things possible to have.

So in conclusion: Yes. I am certain I want to date. And it isn’t because of societal pressure most of the time. Most of the time it’s because I believe in how amazing it is to have a ride or die that you also have really good regular sexual interactions with. I’ve seen it firsthand by watching my best friends, all of whom have found someone. What’s more is that I seek to enjoy my life as deeply as I possibly can in every regard after the depressed hell I’ve made it through. It’s a rocky uphill climb, and has been really hard with cptsd, but I believe I’ll get to a place someday where I get to enjoy something that is equivalent to a stable and happy marriage. Whether or not I wear a dedicated ring on my finger or am legally sharing property."
raisedbynarcissists,fm0t502,t1_fm0l912,1585665659.0,"Dude gonna speak as a bisexual and a queer woman here, I’m fairly tall with a genetically higher level of testosterone (doesn’t mean I’m a man or rugged per se, just that I build muscle more easily than most girls, have slightly more thick body hair in some places than the average woman, have a rather protective energy to me, as well as some complications with my fertility and dietary requirements.) 

I used to feel the same around everyone. Might be because I am built pretty sturdy and athletic, and I’ve never been particularly afraid of conflict. I’m sort of uppity and eager to fight a bitch at my worst. It makes you anxious about potentially intimidating to people without meaning to be.

With women who are slender or smaller you kinda feel like a beast sometimes. 

If I feel that even as a woman with a fairly high voice  and effeminate face, so I can’t imagine what it’s like to deal with that anxiety as a man.

I know it’s easier said than done, but I hope you come to accept that being sexually attracted to people and acting on such a feeling isn’t inherently predatory or exploitative. Even if you are more of a dominant partner. So long as you’re really in tune with the other person and checking in on them, communicating— giving them room to consent, it shouldn’t be a problem. Maybe you can ease the fear by adopting habits like straight up asking partners if they’re feeling ok in the moment, taking interest in what they want and the like. All of that can be extremely sexy to women, word to the wise... Nothing gets the average woman wet like feeling safe and cared for by a strong or even imposing figure. One of the sexiest things a man has ever done for me personally was when my ex gave me a bold command without being condescending or rude. I just about melted into his arms. It’s very exciting to be with someone who is confident but not arrogant, domineering but not hurtful. 

There’s hundreds of years of beauty and the beast resembling stories to reinforce that idea. 

There are also a fair amount of women who just want to roll in the hay no strings attached. There are some women who are downright manipulative or abusive dipshits too, and you probably know all of this, but being an abusive or rapey creep doesn’t have a gender.

Giving affection to those you’re attracted to regardless of gender is normal to anyone who isn’t like your parents. Men are human beings who deserve to be loved and treated with tenderness too.

You’re right that no woman can you act as your mother, but there’s probably a lady out there who can take care of you and be taken care of by you, help you grow, help you as you re-parent yourself.   

I hear you on how hard it is to let people see the real you though. Real connection takes honest vulnerable self disclosure. I know it gets easier with practice though. You gotta take it step by step and work your way up."

Personally I wanna punch people who chew with their mouth open and make those noises, it’s so inconsiderate and downright insulting to people nearby.

You need to be honest with your partner though. Maybe have a sit down outside of the bedroom to talk about his performance. Start with what he does right and what you like, to cushion the blow, then explain to him the physical discomfort the slurping gives you.

I’m dreadfully sorry, and angry about the traumatic awful things that have been done to you."

The exception really is when I meet my best friend, whom I have a really deep bond with that’s been reinforced for more than a decade now."

AskReddit,flyxtyw,t3_fruade,1585611308.0,"I hiked 50 kilometers in one day in the North Swedish mountains with my father because the boat he ordered to pick us up to take us to a nearby town didn’t show up and we had no signal.... That’s longer than a fricking marathon and lemme tell ya, by the end of it I was crying on and off like a little bitch cause my feet were so bruised. I believe I was about 17 at the time. It felt like a kind of rite of passage, seeing as my dad’s family hikes a whole lot in the region. 

Mosquitoes bite every square centimeter of you they can get to once you get below a certain altitude. I could barely walk for a week afterwards. Still, I guess it gave me a new level of self confidence. 

My family hails from the lappland region of northern europe. I feel like I earned the right to call myself a northerner that day. Let it never be said that I can’t handle pain, discomfort and exertion."

No, although my dad is unnervingly hostile to any young man I choose to go out with in conversation for next to no reason.

ADHD,flslhx2,t3_fqkuvg,1585444872.0,I feel like what op means more than willpower (because willpower can definitely work in our advantage as adhders) is that we need to not beat ourselves up or berate ourselves for just.... being built a certain way that is different. There is no “overcoming” your physiology. The best you can do is learn to use it to your advantage and roll with the punches. There are good things about this bodily attribute to balance the negative stuff.

drawing,flsiwyl,t1_flsav7c,1585443158.0,"I think there’s no large compositional issues here, it just seems like you would make art that satisfies you more if you delved deeper into getting a feel for human and animal anatomy. You have a very good foundation already, and know more about human proportions than most! So it’s really just a matter of practicing. Pick a bit of the body and do studies from reference every day. Even half an hour per day of practice can add up over time and make you feel more eager and enthusiastic about drawing. Maybe do some still lifes too to help you with understanding ie. Object placement and creating a 3 dimensional space in 2d. So, just keep practicing from reference, the more you do that the easier it will be to draw from imagination."
drawing,flsibt0,t1_flsgovf,1585442776.0,"The person here is onto something tbh, the placement of the tail is a bit unfortunate. I would examine the curvature of it and try to imagine where it connects to the tailbone of the human skeleton. In order to communicate that visual info more clearly you would benefit from the contours of the scorpion tail closest to the legs going in a different direction, that particular line can have a huge impact on how our brain interprets the way an object hidden from view is placed.

Additionally I would take care about drawing so close to the edge of the page like you’ve done here. It makes for a sense of visual imbalance and mild unease. It’s good to either plot out the whole figure you are about to draw in a way that is equally centered on the page. Alternatively you could cut the character out using scissors or a box cutter and paste it in the middle of a new page for a nicer presentation that drags less attention away from the drawing itself.

Hope that helps! I like the drawing itself. It’s got personality!"

witcher,fk5m119,t1_fk53gz9,1583883273.0,"In The Last Wish a woman says “you’re ugly, that’s alright though. Women love ugly men” and while that kind of thing is thoroughly subjective, as a man loving woman I feel there is a drop of truth in that idea lol. Straight women have a long habit of liking fearsome men without much regard for tidy cosmetic details. Straight men have dimorphic characteristics that can look crude and strange, even beastlike at times. They’re not typically aesthetically pleasing by nature in the way women can be. Especially when they get past their late twenties or so. Their skin can’t glow the same way, they grow coarse beards after puberty and in a traditional context often end up with scars from masculine customs like being encouraged to hunt/fight etc. Straight men are on average far hairier than women. That dimorphism is the birthing pool of the whole Beauty and the Beast cliche. It’s based in a certain level of biological reality, even though there are obviously many kinds of people and many kinds of exceptions to sexual tradition. 

I think it’s fair to assume Geralt is not so hideous that people are repulsed by him in the book canon, but nor is he enough of a groomed prettyboy adonis to have his appearance be his main tool for seduction, and he does have a haunting presence seeing as people are consistently startled by him. Whether that’s all his looks or if it’s also his muted and ghostlike demeanor is also hard to say! Speaking of which, I don’t think it’s at all out of the question that his personality is a big problem of his magnetism either. He has a heroic edge. He happens to be quite clever, gritty, morally thoughtful, initiative taking, hardworking and physically well built. Those things often matter more than a perfect mug."
