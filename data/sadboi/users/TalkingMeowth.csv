Sourdough,fqdgd0a,t3_giardp,1589289065.0,"This starter and I have been through a crazy 3 month journey. Started with AP flour, fed 1:1:1, I thought it was good to go after 3 days because my apartment is 78 degrees and it made sense to me. I baked a decent loaf then stuck it in the fridge for a week, brought it back out to feed it and didn’t understand that it was supposed to double in size but realized that I may have made a mistake. I kept it out feeding every 12 hours, it had bubbles on top. Did this for about two weeks then felt bad about all the flour I was using. 

I made a few loaves using the starter supplemented with commercial yeast. Every so often I would make a concerted effort to really get it going but it would only rise about 1cm over the rubber band. 

I was about to give up but I found instructions for feeding 1:5:5 using only 5g starter and 25g flour. I felt much better about using such a tiny amount I started again. It acted the same way so I decided to add in WW flour, then it took off. I was super excited, it was finally doubling in 12 hours after 3 feedings with the mix. 

Bread was a flat disk with no oven spring. I figured maybe it wasn’t used to the bread flour used in the recipe so I went back to feeding AP thinking it would be fine now. Nope back to barely rising, plenty of bubbles and passes float test.

Still made a flat disk. I’m back to feeding half and half but idk what to do. Did I mess up the bacteria/yeast formation by refrigerating too early? I made a new starter yesterday (starting with WW) alongside this one, I guess I’m just hoping the 3 month journey wasn’t for nothing"

So when I first started I mistook the 3 day blow up for the starter being ready and stuck it in the fridge. After that it didn’t ever rise much again.
