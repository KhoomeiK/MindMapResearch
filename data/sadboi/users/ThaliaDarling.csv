Wrong, just because you haven't seen ban attempts, doesn't mean they are not effective. There are too many for companies to go after everyone. So they send cease and desist letters. Remember when article 13 was a thing.

Wrong, fanart and fanfiction far more easier to acess than videogames.
A naughty incestuous picture can destabilize the mind and make it think its ok. Just look how lolicon porn effecting the japanese.
The videogame and porn studies are not the same.
It should involve policing, because porn is damaging, not as bad as videogames.
It is illegal, and there is outrage, and the people at conventions do get their property confiscated and banned."
DevilMayCry,fo24xnu,t1_fo24cqr,1587449852.0,"The argument wouldn't stand because most videogames require you to buy them and have the facilities to play them. And checks in place, plus warnings. You can't compare the 2.
Then, blame the parents and kids, don't say the restrictions don't work, otherwise we might as well, say lets not do anything and allow people to do whatever they wan.
Its not unfair, its the truth, you only have to see the effect of porn on the brain in studies, its damaging. It is everyone's responsibility to follow some moral standards, and may I remind you, that the people don't even own the characters, the fanartists are stealing someone's ideas to make their own porn which is negaitve in itself."
