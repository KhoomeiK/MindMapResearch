AstrologyChartShare,fo468is,t1_fo3iacz,1587498896.0,"so for the anxiety, gemini is ruled by mercury and fast thinking so you probably have a lot of thoughts. since it‚Äôs your moon sign, they rule your emotions. and chiron is your ‚Äúwound‚Äù or ‚Äúpain‚Äù from this lifetime and something more to it i think but i don‚Äôt remember. the first house is about appearance and scorpio is secrets and deep emotions. my chiron is scorpio fourth house. it affects my family life and pertains to the mother since it‚Äôs in fourth house. hopefully tht helps"

AstrologyChartShare,fo0uadk,t3_g4uhuo,1587419885.0,"a lot of water here in your chart and with gemini moon, do you have a form of anxiety? tenth house is where to look for career and yours is in virgo so i‚Äôm thinking you‚Äôre pretty good with your words or choosing them. you may be looking for something where you can work behind the scenes maybe as a writer or something in the health field. i think bc of mars in virgo you might have luck figuring out yourself by writing down your thoughts. with gemini moon, finding hobbies that you like to delve into also. i‚Äôm not a pro but i‚Äôm hoping this helps especially bc i‚Äôm not good reading aspects much. but i have tht fourth house stellium just as you do which i know either goes with you love your family or you do not at all. i‚Äôm the latter so if you are too, try delving into what makes you different from them and why they make you feel a certain way. they‚Äôve probably affected you in some way or another. since you‚Äôre a pisces, guided sleep meditations might help you also! i‚Äôve done a few that i love and can link you too if you‚Äôre interested. getting to know yourself is actually such a slow process and usually comes with a lot of self hatred at first so be gentle on yourself. if you are interested in tarot, that‚Äôs another way to subconsciously tell yourself your true feelings. and getting more into astrology helped me a lot too so you‚Äôre already on your way!! with chiron in your first house, you have probably been through a lot especially with it being in chiron. but you are strong. my friend has this placement and as soon as he was true to his body and matched his inside to his outside, he became much happier. so find what makes you feel most like yourself. good luck and i hope this helps!!!"
AstrologyChartShare,fnxp1kk,t1_fnxojoa,1587343310.0,ok then coming off as aquarius might be because of tht. pisces is ruled by neptune and sometimes tht might affect how u seem. i am a sag sun so jupiter is my ruler. mine is in pisces 8th house and it affects me a lot. having multiple placements in taurus also probably affects ur personality. this is my guess but ur aspects might be stronger toward ur taurus placements

AstrologyChartShare,fntpig7,t3_g3tcge,1587246301.0,i‚Äôm cap moon and feel my moon shows a lot with how i meet ppl despite being leo rising. i think my leo rising describes my look and aura but my overall people skills are detached. i‚Äôve met ppl who said they thought i‚Äôd be boring before hanging w me which i associate w my cap moon. my sag sun helps me have fun but the capricorn def puts me into depressive states where i am no fun at all
TwoXChromosomes,fntp5ho,t3_g3nso2,1587246112.0,i feel like crap when i see posts about ppl with romantic relationships. i have guy friends and they don‚Äôt crush on me but it‚Äôs bc i believe anyone can be platonic w anyone even if both ppl are attracted to each other. but i‚Äôm 21 and have trouble connecting w ppl at all. i love my friends but i still feel mountains away from them with the exception of one. the crushes i have are very deep but one sided and are probably on the rare side. i always felt something was wrong with me bc i don‚Äôt have anyone who cares for me like everyone else does. i put tht onto the fact tht i have never had a romantic relationship. everyone sees me as the innocent girl too which doesn‚Äôt help. men like to tell me tht. i work as a hostess and am approached a lot but it feels desperate or they tell me things that feel more like insults. so ik it‚Äôs not my looks. but it makes me wonder what it is about me that makes me different when it comes to the people i do wish would connect with me. or why i can‚Äôt get myself to be normal and have a sex / romantic life. idk it‚Äôs hard to express the feeling but in one word ig: shame.
AstrologyChartShare,fntnp3x,t3_g3v0u6,1587245321.0,i think i‚Äôve heard that empty houses usually are neutral energy. you have a lot of water placements though so you probably feel a lot esp w pisces moon in the fourth. a lot of feelings in the home?

AskWomen,fnf208r,t3_g1a2uw,1586899948.0,"therapy can come in many ways imo. i have a hard time opening up to people and feel a lot of hatred probably derived from fear toward those that i do. my therapist was one of these people. i went probably 3 or 4 times, told her it was helping when it wasn‚Äôt, acting completely fine in the session even when i was having horrible days. i would be honest though and open w my experiences. i cried once and still kinda feel gross over that even though i know it‚Äôs normal and expected. 
therapy helped me for small things but i had told my therapist that ever since i was younger (i‚Äôm 21 now), i‚Äôd have a therapist or someone to talk to in my head and i would pretend to ask the questions a therapist would. it would help me just to go through that, and i felt self sufficient. but what really helped me was writing. i wrote a screenplay that went through my emotional state at the time and still go back and read it or work on it even though i feel much better now. i had a lot to work through with my past as i come from a family with various mental illnesses including growing up with my mother and sister with bipolar 2. this helped me focus on me and my problems instead of them and theirs. in fact, therapy is a huge part of the screenplay. my friend recommended writing to me, and i really credit her with being what inspired me to go into myself even when i thought i already had. i feel so much better now. 
not to knock therapy, it‚Äôs great for some! and i think about going back sometimes, but right now, i like being able to challenge myself into what i‚Äôm thinking. just right now i‚Äôm not emotionally mature enough to sit with someone else and speak about my feelings."

i appreciate the capricorn moon because it definitely settles my personality and allows me to adapt to more of a business persona when need be. 
sagittarius mercury to me is one of my favorite placements. it‚Äôs technically in its detriment there but i‚Äôve been told that i speak in an interesting way, and i feel i can talk with a lot of energy to make it interesting. 
i‚Äôm honestly just going off what i‚Äôve put together from my chart and myself to yours since ours are so similar but the houses are off so correct me if this doesn‚Äôt feel like you"
firstimpression,eppvrke,t3_bvj7aq,1559393077.0,a cutie imo. you seem very nice and like you can keep a good conversation. extroverted but not aggressively loud. genuinely interested in people
AskAstrologers,eppvm8o,t3_bvhhs9,1559392959.0,"you seem like you‚Äôd be a lot of fun lol, but yea it‚Äôs probably bc you don‚Äôt have too many libra placements. i sometimes do not feel like my rising sign but always feel very sagittarius bc i have way more placements in that."
AskAstrologers,eppv32a,t3_bvjm4y,1559392548.0,"i‚Äôm kinda newer to this too but hear me out. my sun and rising are very social placements and as a socializer, i‚Äôll approach just about anyone and try to make conversation. so, socially i‚Äôd just say if you go out anywhere, go with another friend who can introduce you to people. i guarantee there‚Äôs someone who is willing to befriend you as long as you are attentive and can keep conversation. as for the romance sector, we‚Äôre in the same boat. you are scorpio rising so do you come off as intimidating to people? i know a few scorpio risings, and they seem that way but they‚Äôre also the hottest people i know lol. but i wonder if that cap moon thing seems to hinder a lot of relationships bc a lot cap moons i know have never been in a relationship (or as for me, don‚Äôt get approached). if you figure that one out, let me know bc i need advice there too haha. but good luck and hopefully this helped!!"
