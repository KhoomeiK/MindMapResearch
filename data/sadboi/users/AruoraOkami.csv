Instead of being a hardcore otaku and priding themself on being true fans of Ruri and TSL, FMA's Envy prides themself on their appearance and accurate shapeshifting ability ( perfect appearance and voice) and the psychological games they can play on their victims with that ability (basically inflicts the greatest amount of suffering on humans out of all the homunculus and enjoys that status).

Why? Because yes your mother should have been paying attention when she offered to do this for you (and not watching TV) AND according to your post history you are also 17 years old so you should be capable of dying your hair yourself (unless of course you have a disability/injury or something else preventing you from doing it yourself). My mom dyes her hair by herself all the time and I dyed my hair myself when I was a teenager. Also, if you don't have a lot of money like your comments/ posts have said, it kind of looks like you're fishing for a free professional dyeing. If moneys an issue, then hair dye or professional dyeing shouldn't be a priority right now. If your hair is noticeably patchy, try again? Wear hats? A wig?

Right now I have been given compassionate academic accommodations meaning all my papers (only) have extended due dates till December 30th( and into the new year if needed). I might have to extend it to my finals as well but I will see how my first one goes today. I have failed classes because of how depressed I am. I have missed classes because of my depression. I have suffered for so long but no more. Also I simply cannot afford it lol.
I just want to stop suffering, I am tired of it. My parents haven't exactly helped either with the whole mindset of ""mental health is made up for people to be attention whores!"". I've managed to keep everything secret from them.


Anyways, check to see if your college has any kind of supports for you to use. If not, try to seek out community supports. I can offer some free supports but I am also in Canada so they may not apply to you but here's one https://good2talk.ca/about/. Its a confidential phone service catered towards post secondary students like us. They will take your call for anonymous single session counselling but they may not be able to refer you to local resources. ""Anyone who does not fit in the above group and calls the helpline will receive support and if appropriate, referrals to other services based on an assessment of their needs."" 
I also know of a few chat room websites catered towards mental health if you'd like :)"

Are these terrible classmates from your highschool by any chance? 

My bullies from middle school ended up going to the same highschool as I so the torment continued. I very much wished I had transferred elsewhere, nothing really good happened to me in those four years.

Are you in small classes? A small college? 

People tend to know everyone in at least familiarity and not necessarily friends in these cases. Basically everyone knows everyones business and gossip gets around easily. Routine= boredom so people can use that to start causing shit.  Also is there another section of this class you can take to get away from these losers?

Do you have peer support/ student help centre to go to for help/advice?

I honestly see university as a bigger highschool. There's still the cliques, gossip, rumours, class systems and such that existed in highschool.

One of my half year classes had group work and I ended up being a third wheel to this not so nice group. They basically left me out of everything and took my work and rewrote it to their liking without permission. And used the wrong citations. And talked over me in the presentation. And contradicted what I said. And gave me the wrong copy of the presentation to edit and finalize then later tell me they were going with another version that I had no say in. And the citations were all in the wrong format and other things weren't even cited. In a fourth year course. Improper/ absent citation can put you in front of a committee for infractions of plagiarism. It's really bad news when that happens. And they were so bitchy to me in their interactions. Like I brought an activity incentive and they said ""Oh we didn't think you'd actually bring it but we'll take that anyways.  We didn't think you'd put in the effort."" A paraphrase to the longer form of which they said."
