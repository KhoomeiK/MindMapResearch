AskWomen,fqszyyw,t1_fqsj8wv,1589625128.0,"I work in aerospace and a large number of the contractor mechanics are disgusting. One handed the only female contractor a broom because it was women's work. One would only call her ""the female"". One guy would call every girl matilda because ""we were all the same"". The worst I can recall was a guy that told her she shouldnt wear the clothes she was wearing because it would distract him, and another time she wore tighter fitting pants and he commented on her not leaving much to the imagination. Coincidence you said aerospace and I wanted to rant about the disgusting ones. The others are amazing and praise my work as well as eachothers with great respect.

To contribute, when contractors come in they think I'm 18-22 and try to get with me, or try and play little mind games. I'm 27 and my boyfriend is their crew chief, it's always hilarious.

Edit: her clothing was totally work appropriate for a sheet metal contractor"

I also use an extra board to poke holes in it when I'm doing something for someone for more even heating, this tape makes it easier than the plastic stuff. I read it heats more evenly somewhere, I'm not sure if it is true or if I am wasting my time lol

Their future plans outside of social media are in their hands and if they choose to post face and names then yeah.. 

I completely agree with the productive part, although she did bring more attention to the money aspect than being productive. I didn't suggest OnlyFans, I would have suggested trying a new skill such as sewing masks which is extremely easy to pick up/learn and to sell or use Youtube to learn a skill that can produce a product.

I work in a tool room/stores for a mechanic/maintenance company and if someone is caught without tool control done, having personal tools purchased after that they didn't add, or with something without their initials engraved can be a fireable offense. The point of tool control is if something is left behind, its owner is easily found AND to protect your personal tools from being stolen.

It sucks but I think it might be all on OP sadly.

Edit: The company shouldn't keep them, but if these ended up being someone else's personal tools then it is on the company. Very tricky, probably company or location dependent"
