The vet isn't always physically available but he lets us call and prescribes things that we pick up for my cat. I'll try and keep it as clean as I can. I'm not neglectful at all.

1200isplenty,fjngp9z,t3_feekgb,1583506997.0,"Recipe for the omelet:

Crack three eggs (I used medium size) in a bowl.

Whisk by twirling it between your hands, like you're starting a fire, until bubbly and creamy yellow.

Get a skillet (I used a small non-stick one), set it to low-medium heat and add the butter. Let it melt, but keep sizzling to a minimum. Tbh don't let it sizzle at all.

Once all the butter is melted, add the eggs to the skillet

Stir them with a spatula, pushing off any cooked edges from the sides of the skillet.

Keep stirring until curds form. (I like to tilt the skillet toward the flame to make sure they hold shape better.)

As they hold their shape, push the eggs over into one side of the pan, making an almond/crescent moon shape.


Let the eggs cook for about 30 seconds, then carefully flip and let that side cook for 30 seconds.


Add seasoning as you want.~"
