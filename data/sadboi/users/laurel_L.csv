People are flawed. What makes people great is their ability to own up to their mistakes and reflect.

She didn‚Äôt have a grandparent who experienced segregation (she probably did but they were on the white side of course) or ancestors who experienced slaves.

Rather, she‚Äôs grown up in an environment where all she‚Äôs been shown is how her privilege and freedom of speech/rights have been threatened by those who are not white. Sure that may have been her upbringing, but she is 25 years old. She‚Äôs someone who wanted to get married.
