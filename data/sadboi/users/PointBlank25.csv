MakeNewFriendsHere,fqzfqhv,t3_glrw8e,1589766422.0,"I highly recommend writing an intro where you don't come off as a condescending female dog for better responses. There are about four warning flags here and you've made five points. There's nothing wrong with sharing your country of residence. Don't assume the person will ask for your address lmao. This, your second point, and your third are unnecessarily bitchy and come off as purposely so because you're a woman and you know you'll get responses regardless so you are being overly picky with things. You're blatantly using your advantage, which is fine in most situations, but when a lot of guys here make long and genuine posts, and I turn around and I see five sentences that somehow all contain complaining, it kinda bums me out. ""How old are you?"" ""Don't ask such a stupid question."" See how you sound? This is a friend-making service. Friend. Right now your introduction isn't very friendly."

Okay, let's weight the two risks then. The U.S. is over 33 trillion in debt. If out of 10 trillion, while obviously a significant sum, they're already 33 trillion so you're simply digging the hole deeper, but the point is the hole doesn't need to be attended to. Face the reality that the U.S. could sustain you for years. Your country isn't on the brink of collapse, bud. So that's one end. What's the other side of that, you might be wondering? people don't die! Sounds good to me. let's put a few more months aside to that grandma jenny and Timmy and so on don't die a painful death.

Referring to obama, the man he was god damn vice president for with the wrong name multiple times is not.  Im never going to think theres nothing wrong with him because what he says and how he acts says otherwise. These may seem like small mistakes at first. But then they pile up. One gaffe turns into another and im left thinking that if Biden wasnt told what to do by political advisers hed probably be much worst, and hes bad enough as is.

I can both acknowledge the reality that is there, and also think that trump is a worst option and a frightening reality.

They like trump because he panders to their fucked up worldview and ideology. To them not everyone deserves fair and equal treatment. They also dont believe in healtcare for all. In fact, their worldview essentially is everyone should be for theirselves, and nothing should be given for ""free."" Thats obviously awful, but the point is thats their belief. Lets not twist trump supporters into unaware leeches, that dismisses whats really going on. The problem goes deeper than Trump. He intelligently, as much as people here dont want to admit it, tapped into a market.

I really dont understand what you see in him.

Remove trumps quickness in responding and objectively look at what hes saying. He lacks coherency. Every comment he makes is a narcissistic self defense mechanism. Like let me give an example. I saw a video of trump on a talk show. He said he respects no one as much as himself (how is this guy real?). Then he made a comment on the crowd being not bad, because they werent uninamously cheering for him. Taking 90% and giving 10% socially - that shit literally epitomizes trump. He is an insecure narcissist, and I really dont say this out of ill will against him, despite what you may think. My as objective as i can manage observation is that I cant bear listening to him for longer than a minute before feeling my sanity begin to leave me. Theres certainly something convincing about his demeanor but hes a bullshitter.

Trump fans are nearly as delusional as the man himself, and a big part of that is projection and preferential treatment. If obama said the injection comment - not only would we not hear the end of it, but the extent to which hed have been blasphemed and accused of being mentally unfit and unstable would be overwhelming. Trump? Sure the left criticizes him - but the right majoritarely sees him as a god, and NOTHING changes their mind. The worst part is I suspect a lot of these people deep down have some disagreements with what the man is doing. Maybe they realised a year after his election, maybe later. Putting pride aside and admitting a mistake isnt easy for a lot of americans though, and i honestly believe that that combined with social factors is why this person isnt in the twenties in approval. His presidency should be seen as a disaster. Every presidency has redeeming qualities. To take Trump's, economic stats that largely are because of obama, and use them as reason for being even an above average president is silly.

I personally happen to think I'd bring a lot to the table though, and if you feel the same - why not see if there's some kind of something there? After all, artistic chemistry would be crucial to something like this working.

I am pretty good, maybe very, with instrumentals and lyrics. Not nearly as good with actually delivering vocals. I feel I may be getting somewhere but to be frank I won't be able to release anything for the next three years with my vocals on it, at least. That basically is why I'm here.

I am looking for someone who's passionate, open minded, willing to blend genres, down to experiment, ultimately wants to make an accessible yet really good product. These are my go to's, and if you feel you check those boxes well probably get along amazing. I want to make this clear: we will create our own sound, and it'll be a force to be reckoned with. Maybe I'm getting too ahead of myself, but in another sense what is creativity if not ambitious?

I'm going to show you a song, but before I do please keep something in mind.

Like it's so fucking simple but everything is professional and consistent enough for it to work. However, the track does lose steam. The thing is you have a great idea for a minimalist/dark beat here. Now you need to make the bongo-esque drum instrument more complex and add a bit of variety. You have the ingredients, now make the song, that kind of thing. Also I'd be glad to help you finish this if you want.

makinghiphop,fm51dmv,t1_fm4v1e0,1585764525.0,"Thanks for the thoughts! So let me start by saying that yours is not bad whatsoever. It is however, in my opinion, repetitive and too simple. I'd make the drums have more complexity, not necessarily in rhythm but details, like adding some hi-hats or something. The piano is good and gets better but I still feel this is missing something considerable. It doesn't have enough in it to feel memorable imo. Still, it's not dissonant at all and does sound good ultimately which is basically what matters. keep up!"

makinghiphop,fm4hcnw,t1_fm3m7qv,1585754156.0,"For yours: the atmosphere is really great and I love the sound of the piano but the melody is way too simple. I'd add harmonies maybe? Or just in general switch up something, because the thing is it just keeps on going and for something constantly repeating you need a bigger hook. This feels like a good concept that needs to be elaborated upon more. Keep up!"
makinghiphop,fm3ho0p,t1_fm3h80v,1585723863.0,"So the production was pretty dope if a bit simple. I like that it's different and it did give me a spacey vibe which fits the video well. I like the flows for the most part and the lyrics are fairly alright if a bit generic/unoriginal. Overall it's pretty cool honestly, I do like it. Keep up!"

makinghiphop,flxtix0,t1_flxt3im,1585589541.0,"out of key? Everything else I appreciate but I just checked and every note is in the key of B Major so I don't really understand what you mean as it objectively is in key. Other than that though I really appreciate your thoughts, although I don't personally think its horribly mixed I do see your points and will continue working at it. Thanks!"
makinghiphop,flxroew,t1_flxovot,1585588544.0,"Okay so you're so very in the right direction with this, but it's not there yet. Honestly I'd keep on working on it. My only big critique - and it is fairly big - is the piano. It works during the singing with the sample but mostly doesnt besides that. Everything else is very creative. Theres an undoubtable originality to this song, yet it sounds old school. Essentially I really enjoyed it, the only thing that brung it down is the piano. You've got talent dawg, good job.

SchizophreniaArtProj,fl8k5x0,t3_fnb1z5,1584925564.0,"I've been debating this. Honest question: would you guys mind if I posted my youtube videos here? I think they're decent nowadays, some people even say I act comfortable in front of the camera. So basically I make vlogs with the occasional video showing my songs. I wouldn't post every single one, just the ones that stand out to me as particularly good. I'm wondering how you guys feel about this? I see that theres mostly drawings and things of that ilk here so I'm not sure."
