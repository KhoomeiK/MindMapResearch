Doing that to a healthy plant won’t do much, it’s no different to pruning branches on a tree. Trees are purposely defoliated in bonsai, all leaves removed. Plants can take more than we think

houseplants,fkjsuv8,t1_fkjqh6k,1584258119.0,"They're not really ""nutrients"" like we think of, they're more just things the plant needs to thrive/live. Defoliating trees wont do much harm unless the tree is already under stress. In bonsai, defoliating certain trees is practiced, and encourages a new flush of growth and produces desirable, smaller leaves. Plants are very hardy and taking a few leaves off the bottom wont do much harm. Plants will continue to thrive as long as they have 1. water and 2. sunlight. With both of those they will push limits you didn't know were possible

We also see all the labels in liberal feminism as incredibly sexist and offensive (ie a little boy who plays with dolls and likes to dress up MUST secretly be a girl in the wrong body according to them. There is nothing wrong with boys playing with girls toys and vice versa, and putting labels on these kids is damaging. Gendering things like make up, toys, clothes etc is very narrow minded and shouldn’t be restricted to any type of person and you don’t need to be one thing just to use them.
