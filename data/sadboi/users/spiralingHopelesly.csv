Throwing a fork handle at my mom's face;

Hit my best friend multiple times (x2);
""choking"" my mom;

I don't want to go back out. 

I don't want quarantine to end.

Apparently I'm afraid of people and being in quarantine has made me very relieved on that front.
I am going insane at the thought of this ending.
