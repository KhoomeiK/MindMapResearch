If you train in England, you need to apply for GTCS registration which is a ballache.

If you plan to teach in Scotland, I recommend training in Scotland.

The PGDE is classed in the same way as undergraduate degrees in terms of funding, so it's free for Scottish students and will cost the same as a year of your undergrad if you're English (which gets added to your loan, right?). You can apply for a student loan through SAAS to help with living costs. I worked through my PGDE on weekends (tough) and I know lots who did the same.

I didn't drive during my PGDE, they take that into account for placements and you won't be asked to travel more than 60 minutes from the address you provide them. So if you live in Glasgow, you'll be unlikely to get anything not on the blue trains at least.

I never reported my abuse to police.

I first disclosed it to a medical professional when asked at a cervical swab around 5 years after the abuse. I then didn't disclose again until I sought EMDR therapy over 10 years afterwards, have since disclosed to 2 nurses when having pelvic exams.

I have never disclosed to family. I have disclosed to close friends and my partner.I have also disclosed to lots of stangers and acquantainces when I was having some real mental health problems and behaving very chaotically. I partly did EMDR because I was torn about disclosing to my family but my therapist helped me to the conclusion that disclosing what happened to my family wasn't necessary for healing.

Something PTSD can do to us is make us feel a pressure to disclose and explain ourselves when really what happened is personal and no one has a right to the knowledge.

If I were you, I would consider doing therapy first and working with your therapist to decide whether and how to disclose. It's a very tricky situation and you may need help to manage possible outcomes. How would you cope and manage your feelings if your family were hostile, denied your trauma or blamed you for instance? These possibilities may be unlikely, but in order to protect yourself, you need to be ready for them.

It's now 13 years later. I still haven't told my family and I doubt I ever will. I am at peace with that decision. If you want, we can PM over the reasons why. My friends and partner know and they provide me with day to day support. The only strangers I tell about it are people on this sub."

Scotland,fq5iwrz,t1_fq42t1n,1589107160.0,"Yeah WTAs can be really loose, particularly in primaries where no one wants to be union rep."
Scotland,fq5iuff,t3_ggfk26,1589107089.0,"I'm a secondary teacher but I have close friends and family members in primary.

It varies from person to person but I think primary teachers have an enormous workload. I think they should be paid more than us tbh.

One particularly bad family member works in a very posh area. Gets to work at 7.30, leaves at 6, works at evenings and weekends. I don't think that's standard but long days and after hours working does seem to be the norm. I'm in secondary where the workload is lower and I work around 50 hours a week (admittedly in a promoted post so that's always more).

There are no SATs in Scotland btw, if you're thinking of moving up. There is standardised testing now but it's more for population-wide data collection and it's not used in the same way SATs data is in England, mainly because we don't have all the grammar schools, academies, free schools pish."
ukpolitics,fq5hzkb,t3_ggxjhv,1589106147.0,"This is such a source of anxiety for anyone who works with children and yp right now. The writer mentions the difficulty of video calls but the reality is that many vulnerable families are impossible to contact right now. Home phones either don't exist or are never picked up, mobile phone numbers are suddenly cut off or go straight to voicemail, email addresses bounce or never respond, letters go unanswered or returned to sender, attendance and homelink officers are unable to go chapping doors. This highlights how tenuous the link between schools, social services and vulnerable families are. Children who may have only has school as their escape from a chaotic and potentially dangerous household now can't even go to the park to escape. It genuinely keeps me up at night."
ukpolitics,fq588cf,t1_fq57vy9,1589095802.0,"Yeah, don't worry, I get that. I don't think most of the skeptics feel this way out of hatred, which can be easy to forget when a minority speak in a really poisonous way. You're right, we have to trust doctors and professionals to lead the way on this and find the best treatment possible.

It's been an undercurrent in the SNP for a long time. Was a big issue at the last conference. Joanna Cherry is a radfem and there's been a lot of nasty rhetoric. Nah, I don't think Starmer is either but I can see him being influenced by their positions definitely. Especially if he's trying to capture a more conservative (small c) Brexit voting crowd down South that might be alienated by discourse on sex vs gender."
ukpolitics,fq54kx0,t1_fq3vxmr,1589092325.0,"Hmm I see what you mean re misdiagnosis. I haven't seen any research identifying this as a reason for suicidality and self-harm though and I did my Masters thesis on this. I'm inder the impression that the detrans rate is very very low right now though  it will be interesting ro see how that develops. I also think this is why the status quo, with extensive counselling and therapy is important. I have a friend who was questioning, had therapy and realised they weren't trans. That's not invalid, and I think it's actually really healthy.

It's interesting you say thay because there has been a huge amount of conflict in the SNP on this and the one leadership candidate who didn't sign that pledge is the one who actually won. So maybe they have more influence than you think. Anecdotally I am hearing their rhetoric crop up more and more amongst non-radfems."
ukpolitics,fq0t9go,t1_fq0hqkg,1589037342.0,I understand your perspective but the stats show us that there are other irreversible decisions yp can end up making for themselves. These are such fraught decisions which is why I'm glad it's professionals making them.
ukpolitics,fq0fw6j,t1_fq09nto,1589031232.0,"I agree it's so tricky. The stakes are so, so high either way to be honest. I know some people have GD that doesn't persist. I think that's why counselling is so so important and luckily that is very much at the forefront of what dysphoric yp receive."
unitedkingdom,fq08fpb,t1_fpzaj39,1589028766.0,I think they believe that trans men are just butch lesbians who have been convinced they are trans. It's insulting to literally everyone.
ukpolitics,fq080zm,t1_fq07rcd,1589028635.0,"ahaha, I see what you mean. IDK I think if you have gender dysphoria it can be one of the least harmful ways of dealing with it."
ukpolitics,fpzyloa,t1_fpzwma0,1589025591.0,"lol. You're reaching. Your posts got removed because they were uncivil and abusive - like the one where you told me to work my one brain cell.

ukpolitics,fpzs0bl,t1_fpzrpl9,1589022657.0,I've answered your questions. I've asked what else you want out of this exchange. You can't answer and just keep ranting angrily at me. I don't want to argue with you because you seem like you're having a hard time and I don't want to contribute to that.
ukpolitics,fpzqvmx,t1_fpzq4no,1589022177.0,Not everything has to be a confrontation or a fight. Have a good day and take good care of yourself.

You are literally just ranting at me. I think you should log off. I know lockdown can be really oppressive but it feels like you should do some things to take care of yourself right now. It's a nice day. Have a cup of tea and go for a walk."
ukpolitics,fpznbvx,t1_fpzmk5b,1589020750.0,"You need to work on your reading comprehension. I literally just said I don't think gender-confirmation surgery should be available to minors. I also don't know of a world where recipients of gender confirmation surgery perform it on themselves, as you seem to believe is the case.

I answered your questions. I am in no way ashamed of my beliefs.

What do you want out of this exchange? It seems like you're taking out a lot of negative feelings on me."
ukpolitics,fpzlulf,t1_fpzkxyy,1589020024.0,"Ugh see this is what I mean. I try to engage and you hit right back with anger and aggression. You're not trying to understand me, you're trying to get a ""gotcha"". You just aren't elegant enough to actually trap someone like that.

I have been perfectly clear about what I believe. I don't think gender-confirmation surgery should be banned. I don't think it should be available to minors. 

I don't think puberty blockers or hormonal treatment should be described as ""castration"" which is why I refuse to engage there. Lots of necessary medical treatment can have an effect on fertility. That doesn't make it castration. Indeed, trans people need contraceptives to prevent pregnancy so I'm not sure what the argument even is."
ukpolitics,fpzkpvt,t1_fpzj6db,1589019575.0,You're imposing views I have never expressed on me. I believe young people should be able to access treatment for gender dysphoria. I believe young people have a right to make informed decisions about their own bodies and medical procedures with the support of doctors and psychologists who inform them and judge them to be mentally competent. I don't believe young people are incapable of making meaningful decisions about their own lives and bodies.
ukpolitics,fpzhl8l,t1_fpzh6l8,1589018358.0,"This is exactly what I mean. I don't know what you're trying to pursue here. You're not trying to convince me, or exchange ideas with me or share resources or info with me. Honestly it feels like you want to argue, and latterly, attack me."
ptsd,fpzhbp4,t1_fpzdbv1,1589018254.0,"Do you have a plan to move out? I don't know if living with your stepdad will help your recovery at all.

I would absolutely encourage you to seek out a clinical psychologist. A psychiatrist may help but talking therapy is what tends to resolve PTSD, medicine usually just helps us cope with the symptoms until we can do talking therapy.

I don't think you mum is going to come around which is unbelievably painful. I'm so sorry. I don't think you can convince her your trauma is valid and I also don't think that's your responsibility."
ukpolitics,fpzgsr9,t1_fpzbtu5,1589018058.0,"This is why I don't think we can talk about this. You view teens using puberty blockers as abuse, and I view denying medical treatment for gender dysphoria as abuse. You view this as castration and human sacrifice which I find frankly hysterical and highly inflammatory. And I know you find my viewpoints absurd too. These might be differences that could be sorted out in a good faith conversation face-to-face but tbh I don't think we are going to have that online."
