BPD,fr26iti,t3_gm406r,1589831991.0,Lol. I honestly have been thinking the same thing. Favorite person!?.... I hate everyone...
BPD,fr24kt4,t1_fr0xu8d,1589831047.0,"I felt this too. It allowed me to separate my behavior from who i am. I have toxic shame, but couldn’t separate it & wondered why this had “happened” to me. Why was I born an “evil” and “bad” person, when I just wanted to feel LOVE so badly... 

So grateful I don’t exist in that space anymore."
BPD,fr22w88,t3_glts1h,1589830222.0,"I sought my therapist out after finally finding the BPD symptoms online. This was 8 months ago. I’m 36. My life has been VERY chaotic all the way through. I identify with 8 out of the 9 symptoms, that’s to the degree they cause suffering in my life. It’s made perfect sense to me, and I’m positive this is what I’m suffering with. I had never heard of BPD until 8 months ago. 

My therapist was adamant about NOT formally diagnosing me. She explained it like a spectrum and something that people could totally recover from and feel better. She felt that a diagnosis could be more limiting for my self perception and would be less helpful for my healing. I came in committed to finding help and a solution, so I was going to DBT regardless. I personally don’t care about a diagnosis, I just want to treat these symptoms and get better ASAP, which is tough, cause it’s painfully slow going to change all of your negative mental patterns after 35 years, but this is what I will do!!

I identify with quite BPD and have become insanely good at presenting as if I am overly capable and confident, I’ve hidden my true feelings away from the world as not to be identified as weak, BUT what’s been going on mentally inside of me is NOT ok, and I will not finish my life out like this. 

I understand that others may have feelings/opinions that differ from mine and I’m great with that. I just want to put my head down and deal with the mental shit that is casing me to suffer so I can find some peace in this lifetime."
BPD,fqy1ol2,t3_glj8o6,1589741152.0,"I’m in a relationship of 4 years with an incredibly sweet and caring man. He has unconditionally loved me through very poor behavior & hard times. I’ve been in DBT for 6 months now. I struggle sometimes with love, passion & sexual desire. I’m sure that I used sex as a way to feel desired and loved from emotionally unavailable people, as an adolescent, and continued into my alcoholism and sobriety. I’m sexually motivated when I feel like someone doesn’t love me. I want the love, acceptance and approval, but once I get it, I’m all dried up down there...It’s been hard. I know I love him, sometimes it’s just harder to tap into. Sexually, I feel VERY little desire. 

I actually feel my true personality is more in line with non-monogamy, but I think I would be insane and not able to treat people correctly in that type of situation currently with the BPD symptoms 

All that being said, I think I can change this, I’m working on totally reframing myself. I want to be in a relationship with my dude & I think over time my sexual desires can change as long as I keep communicating with him. Fingers crossed."
BPD,fqv7zj7,t1_fqt23k3,1589671720.0,"Yes! Currently dealing with this. I work in the fitness industry & am not working much at this point. I know how to work out, and I like it a lot, but it’s my job, my hobby, my passion, my whole identity sometimes. I feel very spacey/empty in my mind, like I literally do not know what to do with myself most of the time I’m not working or working out, so I usually end up watching a lot of T.V., which feels like a thing that’s probably making me dumber. I mean, I read books and stuff too, but way more TV. That,  or it’s the opposite, flooded with anxiety and too many thoughts and overthinking every thought action and word of myself and another."
BPD,fqu24uv,t3_gks1wt,1589650553.0,"Yes and yes, me too! I’m covered in tattoos and piercings, I have often felt judged and had a chip on my shoulder. I don’t perceive the tattoos or piercings to discolor people’s experience of me anymore."
BPD,fqn8azl,t3_gj1nob,1589490362.0,I remember the first time I felt this. I was 18 years old and I was trying to explain to a group of people I was backpacking with that I was “home sick” for a version of my mother that doesn’t exist. Pretty sad 😢
BPD,fqg513z,t3_giltnk,1589338121.0,"I agree that your point overall is a good one, for that, thank you. It would have been more powerful for me had you spoke in the first person.  I’m turned off by the you statements."
BPD,fqe9bi7,t1_fnwxxrc,1589303851.0,"I realized last year that I was really good at burning everything down and “starting over”, but that I did not know how to progress or “level up” myself from where I was, professionally & personally, and THAT is what I was craving. I see DBT as the key I was searching for. Grateful to have found something that provides hope to keep growing myself."
BPD,fq6pwan,t3_gh4ko9,1589136174.0,"I have this. I think it’s called toxic shame. Sometimes, usually around my period, I get into a general feeling that I don’t deserve to live unless someone else validates it to be so. Right now I’m in Wise Mind and that shit sounds ridiculous to me, but it’s a solid recurring pattern. I’ve had weeks where everything has gone very well, I get new clients, I get positive feed back from others, the sun is shinning, I’m in a great relationship, but I feel like I’ve done something terribly wrong, I can’t shake the feeling. Best I can do is acknowledge that it simply doesn’t make sense and must be the BPD."
BPD,fpvxye1,t1_fpurh3r,1588953827.0,Indeed.
BPD,fpvxidu,t1_fpus8rd,1588953601.0,"After 6 months of DBT, I realize for the first time that I’m actually really bad at “reading” people. It’s hard for me to admit, because I’ve been telling myself it’s a super power for 35 years... it’s obvious now that I chronically read people’s faces wrong, I see anger & judgement where there is none & create personalities for them off completely imaginary assumptions."
BPD,fpvwf0k,t1_fpuj8eo,1588953045.0,I was great in bed before sobriety... all those people fucking scored!!! Currently working through all the trauma of my alcoholic life and am waaaaay less fun in bed. I hope to channel more of my drunk self bedroom vibes in the future.
BPD,fpvuy5k,t1_fpouvi0,1588952299.0,"Absolutely everything you just said. I have 1 good week a month after my period, then the slow spiral into hell starts and ends with me on my period having destroyed it all, sitting in the place you just described thinking...”wtf, again!? It was supposed to be different, I had some new grasp on my DBT and was going to surely avoid the descend into hell this time, but alas... I haven’t been able to escape the madness!"
BPD,fpfv2oe,t1_fp943qc,1588584604.0,"I just started therapy 6 months ago. I’m supposed to track, but am totally overwhelmed and confused. I shuffle emotions so quickly lately it’s scary. I wake up in the middle of the night sobbing. I read for hours and hours about BPD and think I’m making connections and breakthroughs only to spiral off into emotional despair relentless angry hell once again. I wonder if reading these threads are helpful for me or not."
BPD,fpeug1l,t3_g9kbrt,1588555177.0,"DAE think about ending their relationship with an extremely supportive partner so you can save them from the hell of being with you? 
I’m in a 4 year relationship, longest ever for me. It’s bad right now. I’m in DBT, was diagnosed w/BPD 6 months ago, but have struggled my whole fucking life with all of it. My partner “tries” to educate himself when I have a breakdown, and it’s helped a little, but I go HARD HARD HARD & it’s the most incredible spiral into emotional hell, I’m angry and uncomfortable all the time, about everything; I’m cold, I can’t sleep, I’m miserable.  I feel like an insane wild animal bucking and going nuts. He has an incredible heart, but I think he doesn’t understand what he’s dealing with. I battle leaving constantly to save HIS life!!!! He begs me not to leave... I love him so much and hate myself for being what I am. Fuck!"
