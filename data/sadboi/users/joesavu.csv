You should be able to control some aspects of what you put into your body, and don't let anyone force you to take something you don't want to. Especially seroquel, that stuff is literally poison for your body and mind. Can't you tell, I have a strong dislike for seroquel."

You know what paranoia is like if you smoke weed and if your neurologically wired in that way. There's different levels of paranoia though, depends on what your symptoms are. But yeah, I'm paranoid by nature, though it's manageable when more mentally stable.

But yeah, you can be paranoid in lots of way, I have lots of example that I've experienced, but I rather not go into it. Usually, some there's some commonality of paranoia with schizophrenia. Paranoia is just a part of it, more other symptoms there are as well that comes with schizophrenia."
schizophrenia,fqu1ogy,t1_fqtznqh,1589650299.0,"Actually I have very low levels of dopamine, in fact I don't seem to be able to produce dopamine at all due to the negative symptoms, it's only when I am experiencing an episodes is when I get an increase in dopamine, which is what I need to help to become a little more functional. Problem though with increased dopamine, causes more behavioral changes and thoughts, moods, perception and so on. It's really important that you have insights into these changes and not let it control you.

Yes, wellbutrin blocks the dopamine reuptakes, but it isn't like I stimulant, I don't even feel a difference taking it at all. All I know is that it helps with my nervous system connections, as it seems that the increase dopamine is the mechanism of action to be able to use more of my strength.

It's weird with wellbutrin if you take higher dosages, it isn't like a stimulant, in fact may cause suicidal ideation or feeling hopelessness. I take 200mg twice a day, which seems to be most effective for me. I guess the side effects of feeling down is due to having those nerve connections more available to your body, and less dopamine is being utilized in the brain. It's just a theory, I don't have any sort of evidence to prove it.

Positive symptoms are more neurological in nature I find. It's not all about the neurochemical that causes positive symptoms. It's just the mechanism of action that shows when the neurological part of the disorder becomes the issue.

So for me, the only way to become more functional is to improve the neurological problems that comes with the disorder, in which you need to get your brain and body to produce as much dopamine as it can.

It's treated as a psychological disorder, which where the antipsychotics come in, but they don't have with the biological problem of the disorder. Actually, antipsychotics can make it worse, or even prevent you from improving your negative symptoms. So you are stuck at the far end of the spectrum that your disorder puts you in, and can't improve due the antipsychotics keeping you there. 

IDK, it's all in theory from what I can tell from my own experience with my disorder. It different for everyone, and I'm not an expert into the neuroscience of the disorder. I do know that producing more dopamine is necessary to improve the negative symptoms, but at the expense of having stronger positive symptoms. But if your at the high functioning end of the spectrum, the positive symptoms can be managed or even improved upon.

It's easier during episodes, as it seems like this is the mechanism that allows for energy to be processed. But then if I try to use too much of my strength, it's very difficult for me to recover that energy still.

Generally, I find that if I can get my brain more stimulated, or more activated, it helps with being able to function more. After eating I always drink a cup of coffee to help with getting my nerves more stimulated. That's the problem, is that my brain doesn't want to be stimulated and nothing seems to help, unless it some sort of stimulant in nature.

For the negative symptoms, it's sort of a nervous system problem for me, if I'm able to use more of my strength then usually it's a good sign that I am able to function better. It's when I can't use my strength, is where the problem lies, and that's usually happens after an episodes.

I've tried lithium and depokote, back when I was first diagnosed, seemed like they were helping, but I stopped for some reason.

Years in, I felt like I've reach a point where I just couldn't improve my negative symptoms anymore, it was like I wasn't able to improve anymore than what my biological make up allowed me to.

Then eventually I realized that one of my problems was that my nervous system couldn't maintain it's connections very well so I would get very tired quickly if I tried to use my energy. Well, I got on wellbutrin and somehow helps with nerve connections ( I assume it's helping more with dopamine production for nerve communcation). Also, the thing I notice as well, is that my episodes would also help with better nerve communication, so that also helped.

IDK, I'd stay far away from religion as possible, as you are most likely prone to having delusions about it. The more religious you become, it's like the more symptomatic you also become.

I wish we can get brain scans over the course of our treatment to see exactly what they are doing to your brain.

For my own experience, the first major psychotic break is going to the be one that's going to cause the most significant changes to your brain, in which you start to experience severe symptoms. Your IQ will most likely be at it's worst by this point. Ongoing episodes afterwards may not have that much of an affect on your IQ, if you are able to maintain your negative symptoms or even improve them in some way over the long term.

In my experience, I continue to have episodes, probably 2-3 times a month, as long as I can recover from those episodes I don't see lowering my IQ any. Then again I'm not on meds.

I have notice that some stronger antipsychotics will cause your short term memory to become worse, but I wasn't on them long enough to see if my memory became worse over time. My short term memory is already bad as it is with this disorder. And my ability to recall memory at the beginning of my disorder became harder too.

If anything, treat your negative symptoms and your IQ should improve over the long term. Possibly get off of antipsychotics if you can, if you don't need to take them if your positive symptoms are more manageable.

I find that the only way for me to recover from the episode is if I can get my nerves to function properly again by producing more dopamine for nerve communication.

Guess that this becomes a real problem in the long term, as it got worse for me over time. By accident, I find wellbutrin sort of helps with the dopaminegic action so the nerves can communicate properly again. Still it isn't enough right after coming down from an episode, it takes a couple of days and in that time it's hard for me to do anything, but I need to force myself physically so that the nerves can communicate properly again. This is what I notice with my disorder, but it may be different for others.

Edit:

It's makes it hard for my brain to become more stimulated as well, especially in the areas that I need for executive functioning. Mainly I just lack the energy and recovery from physical activities as well.

Edit2:

At the beginning of schizophrenia, it seems like your first psychotic break comes about when your brain cannot maintain higher functioning anymore, so you degenerate to the lowest possible state of functioning and that's where most schizophrenics end up eventually.

And pretty much, if you try to improve your negative symptoms, the positive symptoms will just make them worse again. So it's important to know what your episodes are doing to you."
schizophrenia,fp8vpqg,t3_gbqx3b,1588404633.0,"Problem is that even that these type of theories with no real evidence, but becomes a real problem for those with delusions due to how disconnected from reality we already are.

Probably check some other sources on the topic. One I read as that the computer to simulated would use infinite amount of energy to run, so this rule it out.

It's a tantalizing idea for sure. For me, having gone through the schizophrenic experiences means that we are all sort of preprogrammed in the say way, so it may feel as though we are in a simulation once we've lost our sense of reality."
schizophrenia,fp8v28v,t3_gbzl6l,1588403968.0,"Some find it to be unethical for that very reason. For me, I find it is making the problem worse than actually helping it in the long term. The side effects are horrible for you too.

Chemical lobotomy is one way of putting it, don't think it's by design. More like it was discovered by accident, that blocking your brains way of communicating also stops those positive symptoms. At what cost though? For me the cost is very steep, due to how it also prevents you from treating your negative symptoms as well."
schizophrenia,fp8udwf,t3_gbyudi,1588403308.0,"For me, the one diagnosed, I avoid my sibling mostly even though we live in the same house, he goes through similar episodes that I do but is able to function with them.

schizophrenia,foyvcja,t3_ga47lc,1588179857.0,"For me I'm just unable to produce dopamine to be functional in a daily basis. Just trying to get myself more awake after I wake up is hard enough. So I drink coffee at ever chance I get, usually each time after a meal will give me the most uplift from drinking coffee.

I'm on wellbutrin, so it helps me even more with the uplift when drinking coffee. There are days when the negative symptoms are just too bad, and nothing will get me out of it. I have to wait until the negative symptoms can improve on it's own so the coffee can kick in again.

Sure any sort of stimulant can make going through an episode more pronounced, it doesn't cause the episode to become worse as in more positive symptoms. You would already have to have those positive symptoms to begin with and a stimulant would just amplify it.

For me adding these stimulants aren't bad for my episodes, they are sort of good if you can improve the negative symptoms with it. I guess that's the problem with schizophrenia, is that the negative symptoms are always going to be prevalent no matter how much stimulants you take."

yeah I've definitely got alot of those things you've mentioned. It's probably all to complicated to fix, and requires a great deal of insight and recovery to improve them.

I've learned how to recognize my symptoms, so with that I can try to improve them in some way, but really it's all neurological that needs improving and is difficult to do."

It was much worse in the beginning, I've been able to some of it back, but still it difficult to even tell if I have tooth pain or not, and light scratches and bruises hardly affect me anymore.

My episodes affect my taste buds too, seeming being able to taste more for the duration of the episode, which may only last a day or 2.

I'm taking wellbutrin, seems to be helping with keeping my nerves more sensitive than before. But pretty much, I unable to regain the sensitivity I had before schizophrenia.

For me schizophrenia is really a neurological disorder that affects the prefrontal cortex in some way. I notice that more I can get my brain to repair the prefrontal cortex the better I'm able to improve with the positive symptoms.

I find antpsychotics affects the neurotransmitters for your brains ability to communicate properly and in doing so causes the neurons to deteriorate. It may not be as noticeable with you are younger, but certain will affect your more when you get older.

It's different for everyone, I don't really know everything about the disorder. I only know what I've gone through with my own recovery. It's definitely really important to gain the insights into yourself to help with recovery."

I think alot of the contributing factors are health problems associated with not being as active as we would like to be with a disorder like schizophrenia.

I can be more physically active with wellbutrin, which is the only meds that I find useful in that regard. And I'm not on antipsychotics so that's another extension on my lifeline. At the same time I don't exercise so I may in my for a rough old age ahead of me.

As I feel right now, I don't feel like I'm going to have an early death, well at least not from schizophrenia. Heart disease or some other cardivascular disorder will probably do me in instead."

The only thing I find useful for me now is wellbutrin, because I've recover alot of my negative symptoms over years.

Off meds I still go through episodes, that vary in intensity and degree of having more negative symptoms, it's like I develop some sort of brain fog that takes awhile to overcome.

With meds I feel like it prevents my brain from becoming more stimulated, as it will prevent recovery of the negative symptoms. Wtihout meds I can try to get my brain more stimulated in order to improve my negative symptoms more, that's where the wellbutrin is helping me with.

Negative symptoms take a long time, years of recover to notice a difference though."
schizophrenia,folzc8g,t3_g84v6z,1587874164.0,"I've taken it while back, felt like it was helping somewhat with negative symptoms. The regular ones didn't notice much of a difference, the ones with higher extracts of withanolides was more noticeable.

I use to be into all these supplements as I notice some improvements, but I got to a certain point I couldn't improve my negative symptoms anymore. I'm now on wellbutrin, and it's the only thing that's helping me getting my strength back.

I need to start working out again, so I can start taking more supplements like whey protein for recovery, which seems to help with brain repair as well.

Some people notice some improvements with lions mane. Negative symptoms are really hard to improve upon, it takes years of actual brain regrowth to notice a difference, but unfortunately with schizophrenia we lack the mechanism for that to occur.

It's really different now, lots of people are there, and much more organized. My previous doctor suggest I should go, but I've only showed up a few times. But I don't think it's going to help me in anyway. Though now I feel like like I'm finally able to improve enough to get my life moving again.

I'm sure the US will eventually figure it out, but other countries will have there higher death tolls by the end of all of it.

I feels with this political environment we've come to know, it's become a circus even when facing tragedy of this magnitude. I need to feed some reassurance during these times, and that's just not happening until a vaccine comes out.

For me it doesn't really make a difference, it's always been the same way of life for me anyways, always at home with constant fears of going outside. Sort of weird that now that I'm not as afraid to go outside, but this deadly virus is lurking around the corner.

I even asked him one time, if he knew he was a psychopath. He agree as if it was nothing. He's been angry at me since forever, because that's just how he is, all he's been was trouble throughout my life. And he doesn't get it why I don't talk to him anymore.

I've only been able to regain it recently as I continue to recover, I lacked my executive functions for years since having schizophrenia.

So that's the thing, some people with schizophrenia can produce too much dopamine for which antipsychotics can help with, but alot of us don't produce any at all so we need more dopamine to become more functional (at least this is what I've come to realize with myself).

I do much better on wellbutrin which sort of helps with keeping higher dopamine levels so I can function better on a daily basis.

Even then, schizophrenia is very neurological to me, so if I hadn't improved my neurological well being then wellbutrin may not help as much.

I've only realized it when looking back, and due to how I can see patterns in things it basically all make sense with my family history of mental illness.

It's very hard to gain insights if you don't know what's wrong with you. It's always hard in the beginning and neurologically don't have the brain capabilities to be able to gain the insights needed to overcome your symptoms.

Try it, it's quite safe and doesn't have much side effects compared to antipsychotics.

There's also CBD, I find it more helpful as a relaxer and I can get really good sleep with it, which in turn makes me feel better when awake.
