So it was a joint tenancy through an agency. The three of us were renting from a landlord.

Yes, I have the tenancy agreement with the landlord and I also have the deposit scheme. The issue is that the money will go back to one of the couple‚Äôs account and they are the ones controlling what amount of money they want to return and it‚Äôs a sum of 950 pounds. 

However, it‚Äôs not a money issue anymore. I don‚Äôt mind receiving less money in order to have 0 contact with such bigots. It‚Äôs the gratuitous insulting and discrimination. Today is me, tomorrow is someone else. Plus, the guy shouted at me a couple of times and he is extremely aggressive."
