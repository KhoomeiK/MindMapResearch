bipolar,fpukgy3,t3_gfk1er,1588915287.0,"I use a bullet journal. It's like a planner and a journal had a baby, and you can use it as much or as little as you like,  I write down tasks and can migrate them forward as the weeks go by.  IF it's an appointment or a due date (return book, birthday) it goes in my google calendar, otherwise, bullet journal.  Only thing that got me through college because my memory is also a dumpster fire.

I have a page to write down happy memories and specifically leave out sad ones because I gotta get some benefit out of a shit memory, damnit :P"

Since I have little/no income I got it for free and since I'm an adult the only person who knows is me.  They might prescribe you a medication to start the process, but you can get it generically (and thus, cheaply.)"

They essentially just grab a couple bites here and there during the day."

birthcontrol,fcmtwv6,t3_ehxfp1,1577792073.0,"I (26f) got a liletta and am currently loving it. 

The insertion was fucking awful and it took them like 3 or 4 tries and I remember  almost passing out and i ended up getting a lot of the side effects - bleeding, extreme pain, nausea, etc. 

But, even a week after getting it while I was cramping I was very much like 'yeah this is great I will definitely be getting another one'. All symptoms disappeared after like 1.5 months and i haven't really had a period since, which is amazing because mine were absolutely dreadful. 

It'll be great and you'll do great. We vagina owners are tougher than you think and as someone who had a pretty lengthy and terrible procedure, the pain IS bearable.  Listen to others about the tylenol and heat and have someone who can drive you home on standby if you react strongly to cramping!"

I have the elf baked highlighter and a couple highlighter palettes - with the Elf highlighter I feel like it's easier to get a subtle glow (and then I just keep layering it on past subtle). My highlighting palettes are gorgeous but glittery and intense

Makeup,f1dk1il,t3_d8ohwb,1569386934.0,"That lip color is so beautiful on her. Honestly, no real cc. I love the more subtle look because it really is just letting her natural beauty shine. I personally like her without falsies because her nose is big yes but I don't think it's a bad thing and I'd worry about her eyes seeming heavy haha.

Opinional Cc: I think the wing should have been brought to the outside a bit more. I like the angle of it but it looks like she's missing the color in the corner of her eyes when her eyes are open. Weirdest nitpicky thing 10/10 great job am jealous"

birthcontrol,ewjbesi,t1_ewjafqd,1565464121.0,"Yeah, attempt 1-3 was the student. I was spending my time trying not to hold my breath and pass out and I had to take a break after 2. Just the clamp was so painful that finally after 3 I was like 'CAN YOU HURRY PLEASE.' Because they were talking and then the experienced midwife did it right away after I said something. Popped in like a charm then.

Next time I won't let a student do it, but I was in ideal conditions (really low cervix, on period, measurement tool went right in no issue) and I understand that they need to learn too, so I'm not mad about that part really, just filled with regret.

Thank you for the advice ðŸ˜­"
