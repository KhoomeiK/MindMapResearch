Edit: I was not the one gaslighting, manipulating, micromanaging, or being emotionally abusive. I was the punching bag that just wanted a normal friendship with her. I am a sponge. I'm so susceptible to this shit. I must have a neon sign on my forehead for narcissistic behavior. They know. What's strange is I'm confident for the most part and outgoing. I don't seem to be easily manipulated. Maybe it's because I'm very empathetic? Well, like I said before, they know.
