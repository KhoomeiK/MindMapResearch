Two years ago but I know exactly how many cams everything is. I count in my head— it’s mortifying. Now that we’re in lockdown ( I live in Texas)I’m feeling anxious, sad & bored. I’m tracking every calorie and I knowwww I’m going to binge. It’s annoying. I’m sorry that you’re going through this too. 😔"
