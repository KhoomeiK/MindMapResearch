My advice, as a youth coach and high school varsity coach. Teach the girls pass and cut motion. Don‚Äôt run an excessive amount of plays. Teach man defense. Doing anything else is a disservice to the game and believe me, I see how poorly it‚Äôs being taught right now. 

Winning means nothing at that level. Have fun and be a good coach/teacher"
