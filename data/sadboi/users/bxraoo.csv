I'm dead scared of hpv, or any kind of other stds, due to well, some shitty events.

Turned out i have heart and thyroid problems. Got appointments for cardiolosgist, endocrinologist, neurologist and psychologist (panic attacks, sleepless nights and anxiety has been unbearable lately, and all of that was caused by the health anxiety) after a not-so-pleasing panic attack a few hours ago.

Googling symptoms was the worst decision so far. Read a few articles about STDs before going to sleep last night, ended up not falling asleep at all. Checked if i have any of the symptoms every hour, going all crazy about it. Parts of my body started hurting just because of how i made myself feel psychologically, started thinking stuff like: “WELL THIS IS IT. I'M DYING, HOW WILL I TELL MY MOM” This was an emotionally and mentally draining journey that is not over yet. 

Thank you so much, truly."

HealthAnxiety,fimkqg7,t1_fimkgrr,1582534674.0,"Try laying down and closing your eyes for a bit, maybe even meditate, relax your muscles. 

Cheesy, but we're together in this."
HealthAnxiety,fimka5e,t1_fimk6nf,1582534061.0,"Not yet, i'm dealing with some intense health anxiety at the moment, so sometimes it's hard to even tell if it's just tense muscles due to nerves or does it actually hurt. I scheduled an appointment later today, hopping that it's nothing bad!"

NoStupidQuestions,fik0tlz,t3_f8ad1x,1582469933.0,"Short answer - no.

Or at least I try my best not to focus on the painful memories. People go through a lot of stuff in their lives like pain, loss, grief, fear, anxiety. Sooner or later all of us have to deal with death. It's okay to miss people, it's okay to miss memories you have with them, but not for too long. It should be from time to time thing. It's okay to remember, but not okay to hold on to it. Life is fragile, live in the moment."
