I think what you mean is you like ""outgoing, ambitious, intelligent, sharp-witted woman."" 

Some/a lot of times/historically when men say ""strong women"" they actually mean someone they can dump all the emotional labor, domestic upkeep, and child-rearing (while also working) on the woman and she never complains. 

""Reserved"" or not ""professionally accomplished"" is not equivalent to ""weak"" which is what this rhetoric implies, intentional or not. Many women are socialized to be quiet and submissive and differential to their male partners, so when ""strong"" means ""outgoing and accomplished,"" it means women can seem to win for losing.

The contrast between those 2 descriptions is enormous, and the 'weak vs strong' dichotomy When you actually mean an individual collection of personality traits is very large to the person(s) you're referring to. 

I appreciate your willingness to engage in good faith. Thats awesome, I know it can be hard to feel like people are claiming you to be a prejudiced person (which I'm not, but many men take it that way).

MedicalGore,fqon72e,t1_fqmz59f,1589519320.0,"I used to train extremely anxious and/or aggressive dogs, I'm so sorry you had such a horrible experience. 

I have a couple of pieces of advice to make you and the dogs you interact with more comfortable! Most dogs are a little uncomfortable with your hand reaching over their face to pat the top of their head. They much prefer under-chin scritches! Direct eye contact is also considered rude & aggressive if you don't know each other very well, so look off to the side; it's much more polite in ""dog."" 

A turned back is also very non-confrontational & could give you a sec to catch your breath so you don't enter the interaction tense. I'm sure there are exceptions, but I've never heard of someone being attacked from behind unless they were running away.

Interestingly, they love reflected behaviors. Scratching, yawning, lip-licking, panting, and stretching are all stress expressing or relieving behaviors. If the dog does one of these, mimick it! It makes the dog feel 'heard.' Done on your own, it can also communicate your stress & discomfort with that dogs behavior. And, obviously you know, stay away from dogs behind barriers like fences, even the nicest dogs can express ""barrier aggression.""

Just some things to keep in mind; I know after I was injured having these concrete things to fall back on really helped me not freak out. It's incredible that you've come out of this still loving dogs and trusting them! You must have a good heart."

TwoXSex,fpuvgp5,t1_fpush0z,1588925102.0,"Understanding of HPV has come a long way. Infertility isn't common, especially if you get a pap regularly. There are more than 150 strands, but there are 9 that cause most of the problems & those are the ones in the vaccine!

There is not a reliable way to tell. The little bastards  an stay dormant for literal decades before being expressed. Viruses are just really really tiny, so we have to look for their effects on the body, not the virus itself. We can detect the presence of HPV affected cells in your cervix, but its because the virus has already done some damage. 

The risk of passing HPV to your child is incredibly low for a bunch of reasons you can Google. Obs are there to work for the baby, gynos work for the mom. A subtle but important difference. 

Genital warts come from strains: 16, 18, 31,33,35, 39, 45,Â & 51.

The common & vaccine strains are: 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58

There's a fair amount of overlap. You have strain 16, 18, 31, 33, or 45. I know 16 & 18 are linked to cervical cancer, not sure on the rest. 

 That's about as good as you're gonna get, but feel free to ask for a test the next time you have an outbreak. Its a biopsy & i doubt insurance covers it tbh.

And ~80% of sexually active Americans have some version of HPV at some point in their lives, so you probably have had it. Sometimes the body can just beat it, which is awesome, cause we don't have a lot in our arsenal to fight it. All warts are caused by a strain of the Human Papillomavirus, even the ones on your hands or a cartoon witch's face. 

Personally, I still think its worth it to get the vaccine, even if you're in a committed relationship, even if you're a bit older, even if you already have been infected by a strain. Who knows, you could prevent a future infection!

Honestly the best you can do is get vaccinated & get your paps regularly so they can spot abnormal cells *before* they become cancerous."

TwoXSex,fpubowv,t1_fpu6t34,1588909053.0,"Genital warts are a result of the HPV. Around half of the US population has HPV at any given time, and around 75% get HPV sometime in their life. Its the single most common STI by magnitudes. It can transmit easily via oral, vaginal, & anal sex and possibly via making out. Condoms don't slow it down. 

Boys can get the HPV shot too, and they should, as HPV is a huge factor in anal, prostate, and penile cancer. Theoretically that should prevent his contraction (if he hasn't gotten it already, which, I'm sorry but honestly I think is pretty likely). The current shot prevents 9 of the most common strains which cause [around 90% of infections](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-vaccine-fact-sheet#what-are-hpv-vaccines).

This rapist can say all day long that he had no idea a grown man having sexual relations with *A CHILD* all day long, but they've lived in this world long enough to know that that's not right. So with **malicious intent** they flouted laws and social norms and kept it quiet cause they knew it was wrong.

You don't have to force children, you can groom them so they live in the rapists fantasy land. The rapist bends whats normal, they tell the child they can't trust other adult figures in their lives, they physically harm them (literally increasing chances for cervical cancer with sexual contact so young).

AskFeminists,foj4xot,t3_g7pi5t,1587808537.0,"A few ways you phrased things made me uncomfortable. I appreciate that you're trying to make a safer, more welcoming environment for people you know, but there are some premises I think you need to adjust.

>Not like men or thinking all men or trash"" but not really meaning it.' 

& 

>""how she felt since age 12 she's been sexualized, objectified, all the fun at the fair ect. There were a bunch more comments corroborating that. So how wide spread is this, like every girl I meet has this ingrained in her somewhere? And if so what can I do?""

Its difficult to explain how reductive this phrasing is, but essentially you're taking away from the validity of these women's perspectives. What do you mean ""but not really meaning it""? Whats the full phrase? Generally, when people use this phrase, it actually indicates a general sentiment of disgust at euro-typical patria-centerism. A less than adequate phrase, but replacing 'all men's with  ""the patriarchy"" generally invites the same level of misogynistic attacks, & lets individual men off the hook for any part in toxic male culture. 

""Every girl you meet has this ingrained in her somewhere""? No. Most women in modern ""western"" culture have been preyed upon, hit on by wildly inappropriately aged, corcumstanced, or positioned men so often that day-to-day life becomes difficult and nerve racking. Women are much more likely to have been hit on by a grown adult before they were 14, by their boss when they had no recourse, or by strangers in groups that they felt physically unsafe around than any man. It's not ""ingrained"" into us by other men; we had to realize the steps we have to take the extra, careful steps we have to take *every day* to ensure our physical safety. 

This means many women are wary, uncomfortable, &/or distrustful of any advances made by men. Especially, when those men only refer to those advances as ""sexual."" Fuck off. We're terrified because we think that's exactly *only* why you're interacting with with, and we have no idea where you'll stop to satiate that interest. 

>How can I make women (sexually interested or not) feel more safe?

Maybe, idk, act fucking interested in women *as people* primarily, and not as a puzzle to solve to get your dick wet.

TLDR: act like 50% of people you meet are at least 50% heavier & stronger than you. Act like half of humanity knows that they have centuries of power superiority over you, will be herd over you, will be believed over you, & consider horrifying transgressions against you as, essentially, their right. Act like [58% of women killed](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/11/30/671872574/u-n-report-50-000-women-a-year-are-killed-by-intimate-partners-family-members) in North America are murdered by their intimate partners, knowing how generous the term ""intimate partner"" is & how often it actually means boyfriend/husband. 

Act like half the people you meet are politically powerful, gay, arrogant, selfish hockey players who think they're entitled to sex. See the world thru **that** lense, and people will stop having to hand-hold you through social interactions."
