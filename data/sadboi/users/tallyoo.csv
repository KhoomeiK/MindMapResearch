if she treats you like this, how would she treat your children? thats one thing that always worries me for example. as long as i dont get better, i aint gonna have some kids. no need for more mentally ill people in this world

OP knows she was an absolute horrible mom and caused their children problems. Oh btw, the children of parents who have BPD are likely to also have BPD. That's how BPD gets manifested after all. Anyways, she owns up to it. That's what counts.

Her daughters have the power to decide whether or not she deserves the abandonment, not you or anyone else in this thread.

I personally would love for my mother to own up to her faults. I respect OP a lot for that. She must've been a through a lot of therapy to be able to realize it. She did well and deserves praise for trying at the very least."

However, inevitably this personality disorder is caused by bad childhood experiences. It is a manifestion of fears , trauma and anxiety. And all the other stuff. Some people become terms with themselves and their actions and start acting towards being a better human being. 

I have hurt a lot of people, I got hurt from a lot of people (I mean, how this illnes manifests). 

Not everyone with BPD are monsters. Telling the person who deals with someone who has BPD (in which one of the biggest symptoms is abandonment issues) to abandom them, is a very hurtful thing to hear and do."

On top of having BPD I also have an eating disorder and.. well my boyfriend is also well built and I get the same thoughts as your gf, sometimes I want to break up over it because it makes me feel super insecure. Then I rationalize again and tell myself it would be very rude to do that just because of looks.

I would guess your girlfriend wants you to gain weight back because she's insecure about herself. She probably wants to keep you all to herself and doesn't want other people to take notice of you. She also might be having eating problems, maybe she's jealous of you becoming fit and healthy. 

I am guilty of trying to make my bf eat more too. 

A big tip of mine is to let it calm down and ask what is actually going through her mind. But of course you aren't forced to stay with her. If it's your limit, it is your limit. Your mental health is also important. 

These are like the first reasons I come up with.. without even reading the comments. I'm pretty sure the comments are trash tho bcz that's what I always see in regards to BPD :)"

Like honestly how selfish do you have to be to make this all abt yourself, just because something happened that you didn't like? Before judging you for not doing something in a state of almost unconsciousness, he should have made it HIS responsibility to watch over you. What kind of bf is he for not doing anything against it?

But then I slowly noticed that I'm not.. so I grew basically older and my mind stayed like a child's

I have the ability be mature, but my child side prevents me from it most of the times. I sometimes enjoy acting like a child, but then my thoughts hit me hard and I'm like ""I'm not 10 anymore, why?"" 

Sometimes I have times where I'm way too mature and then times where I'm like a kid. It's so frustrating.
