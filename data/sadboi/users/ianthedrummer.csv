I went through a lot of baby name lists and books and made a list of the names that spoke to me. In the end I decided I wanted my name to start with the same letter as my birth name, and after a while a name popped into my head and it just 'clicked' right away. Then I looked up celebrities with the same name and thought: yep, I'm definitely an ian."

asktransgender,fpgfswh,t3_gd8fdx,1588601834.0,"At about 4.5 months on T I went to visit my grandma (who lives on the other side of the country) with my sister. At some point we made a stop to get coffee at some roadside shop. I went to the counter and said: ""one medium coffee please."" Upon hearing this the girl behind the counter started laughing and said: ""I thought you were going to say 'a medium beer.'"" I was caught off guard by this and while laughing said ""it's a bit early for that isn't it?"" This banter continued for a bit until I got my coffee and we said our goodbyes. Only when I got outside did I realise that she saw me as a guy (based on the way she interacted with me) and with that a guy old enough to drink (which is 18+ here). I was so happy about it that I wrote it down and saved it on my phone, because up until that point I wasn't sure if I passed, and besides that I thought I looked like a 15 yr old boy while I'm actually 21."

asktransgender,fnywtri,t3_g4mom8,1587378636.0,"I definitely felt 'fake' when I started questioning my gender, especially because I wasn't sure about my identity right from the start. But then I realised that all my doubts were related to other people and their opinions, rather than my own feelings. After I shed all these outside factors/judgements it became very clear that I'm a guy (I'm FTM) and the only way for me to be comfortable would be to transition. However, I was only 100% sure when I started imagining my future self; I just could not in any way imagine a future version of myself who was female. In addition, when I imagined my future self as a man, a husband, and a father, I could actually see a (happy) future for myself. I'm now 6 months on T and I am finally starting to feel comfortable in my body, and have 0 regrets. Whatever the outcome of your journey may be, I hope that you find yourself and with that comfort and happiness :)"
asktransgender,fnvju8c,t1_fnvd6fw,1587295975.0,"Haha I mean, the other people in my class that are from the US are some of the loveliest people I've ever met so there's that :) And you're definitely right; there are a lot more accepting, loving people in this world than one might think, though sadly the haters are the ones that are constantly 'in the spotlight.'"
asktransgender,fnvjh18,t3_g3zlq4,1587295599.0,"I experienced the exact same thing and for a while it made me think like I wasn't actually trans and just made it up in my head. The way I see it is that it feels stronger because instead of having vague, unidentifiable feelings it's a lot more focused, and since you're aware of it it can feel a lot more intense. It reminds me of when people get a cut or something and at first they don't feel it, then they see blood, and when they realise where it's coming from they start to feel the pain. It might also be that when you don't realise you're trans you can still rationalise these feelings of discomfort as just an everyday type phenomenon that everyone experiences, and when you realise you're trans you know where it comes from and what you can do about it, hence making it harder to deal with the current situation (for example, waiting for T became a lot harder when I knew I needed it to feel more comfortable in my body. Especially my voice made me way more dysphoric when I realised that it's actually supposed to be deeper)."
asktransgender,fnvcai6,t1_fntzoy2,1587287889.0,"TL;DR in my personal experience there's pretty much no TERFs in gender studies, but that might be due to where I'm studying.

That's an interesting question! Before this thing occured, gender studies was like a queer utopia in my experience; when I started I was still pre-T but everyone (incl. professors) still effortlessly referred to me as ""he"" and was super supportive of not just me but all trans/non-binary people in my class. We also focus on trans issues and literature that imagines trans realities in a positive light in literally every class. In other words, being in this programme was very healing, positive and inspiring. However, this one person has been consistently misgendering the trans people in my class, especially people who use they/them pronouns. Even after correcting her multiple times she keeps doing it. I must note that I'm studying in the Netherlands and homophobia/transphobia/racism/etc. are expressed in a 'below the surface,' more subtle type of way instead of overtly, so I rarely encounter hatred/prejudice like this in general. I think there might be more TERFs in gender studies programmes in the US though (not to generalise the US because there are obviously also MANY super lovely people who support trans people there, but this person in my class is also from the US, and the TERFs that I've seen/encountered online were also predominantly American)."
asktransgender,fntmm6q,t3_g3o5ry,1587244700.0,"This literally happened to me yesterday and it was the first time it's happened to me. One of my classmates (note: I'm in a Gender Studies masters programme) started referring to me as 'she' and puttig my name in parentheses ON PURPOSE (to one of my classmates, not even to my face)! I really don't understand why people are like this... And she had the audacity of saying that she ""still respects me as a colleague."" Didn't expect to find a transphobe where I did. Just remember that it literally has nothing to do with you, some people are just assholes and/or ignorant."

drums,fn36xoq,t3_fz5xq2,1586614343.0,Bought this kit second-hand last year for â‚¬500.

It came with all of the original Tama hardware + Paiste 101 cymbals in their original boxes. I don't have money to replace the cymbals right now but I can live with them for now. The original heads are still on there and are decent but I'm looking into replacing those as well (have never done that before so any advice is welcome! incl. what heads might be best).

My best friend and I are both introverts and oftentimes when we hang out we are just chilling together watching a movie or gaming or something. I think us hanging out doesn't interrupt our recharging because we don't have these expectations of having to fill silences, having to adhere to what other people see as having a good time, or anything like that. Just letting each other be ourselves and not expecting anything of the other is what saves us both a lot of energy while still enjoying each other's company."

I finished my 'psychiatric assessment' at Stepwork and got 'green light' to start T, which took about 4 months (quick compared to VUMC). One thing that does suck when transitioning through Stepwork is that not many endocrinologists work with them, so waiting to see an endo can take quite a long time; for me the wait is 6 months (4 left to go now). Just wanted to let y'all know that because for me it was a huge disappointment."
