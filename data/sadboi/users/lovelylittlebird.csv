I have been there for a few years now, the quarter life crisis is very real...and it is NOT the same ""mid-life crisis"" that boomers find funny or that is in the movies. It's a crippling existential dread and it is in many ways the fault of those who came before us and how the workforce is exploiting us. To the ""company"", we are not people, we are not humans with needs and wants and hopes and dreams, we are trapped under the struggle of wanting to have shelter and food while being forced to work for shameful wages, pitiful excuses for benefits and expectations that do not value US as human beings, but as things that toil to produce. That's at least how I see it, and it is very real and it is not funny or cute or something that someone should write a cheeky buzzfeed article about. I feel that, and I am so, so sorry that you're hurting. You have so much value, inherently, not because of what you can do or produce, but because you are you and you exist.

My SO and I are both working, but we're both at charter schools, which means, essentially, that both of us working is about the same as what one teacher with his experience should be making, ideally.

It is a completely optional project for them, and they can choose their goal, either 25,000 or 50,000, and my admin and I have agreed that they can earn credit for it, as it is indeed a VERY big ask.  I have also let they start early and have made sure they know that it is about working hard and doing their best while having fun with it. 

They are very excited and I hope to have at least a few events for them where I provide snacks and treats and we all work together. Admin has also allowed to me to tell them that we can have their work printed (a la book form) if they want.

I work at a drop-out recovery school currently, and I am really excited to have this little group that is so excited about it, and I have also let them know that the month and word counts are a goal, and I am here to support them.

First, English teacher here. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR TIME AND EFFORT AND MAKING IEPs AND 504s! You are amazing and awesome and I appreciate you.

So, I haven't actually done Nano before, despite having my BFA in Creative Writing, and I decided that I want to do it this year...I even signed up for the educator stuff and have some students that signed up to do it with me. 

I get paperwork, grading essays (and lesson plans, and meeting minutes, and the parts of the plans you create that I need to add to, and letters home, and worksheets........ANYWAY!) is a lot. Being in education is a lot. But I think you might be better if you think of this as not another thing to write but as a way to blow off steam. This isn't more paperwork, not an IEP or a 504 or yet another referral for services that makes 13 this week...it's just you getting to do you. Writing whatever you want to write. Sitting down and just letting it all out. 

If you want to do this, and decide to do this, and look at it as something fun and exciting and as an outlet, I think you absolutely can and will succeed.

If you've already decided that your heart isn't in it this year, that's okay, too. If you don't want to say that because it feels bad or you feel guilty about it, don't. Nano happens every year, and, as a writer, you can write whenever you want, even if it isn't November. 

Whatever you decide, you are awesome and make sure you are taking care of you."

nanowrimo,f3qnkem,t3_dglm35,1571077707.0,"I personally think you should write how you write. I know what Gibson girl hair is, and that is oodles of fun. Now, will your readership be smaller? Sure, that's entirely possible. 

But for me, and I am an English teacher, so I LOVE reading, if I find something I don't know or understand, I look it up. Why on earth would anyone want to be limited to things they already know? And if someone doesn't care enough to look, then they get to miss out on the aspects of the story that could be solved by a Google search. 

We literally live in a world where everyone has a computer in their hands with which they can access a wealth of human knowledge. Write what you want to write. I personally live for allusions and love finding cool connections in the text, for me there is joy in that. As long as you don't write in a way that is condescending, you will be fine. 

For goodness sake, I had to look up an allusion from ""Gatsby"" last week for a student, and I didn't feel stupid in saying I didn't know, found the answer, and shared it with my class. Don't ever let anyone tell you to not to write what you want to write. Will some people miss things? Sure, but people miss all kinds of things, even that ""normal"" people should understand. (And, for the record, no one is normal, we're all weird and we all have quirks and we all approach the world differently. That's one of the most amazing things about humans.)

Don't change your style to fit the needs of others, unless you sound like a condescending, pretentious jerk. And somehow, I think you don't sound like that.

I was SO excited about it and thought it was amazing, but now I can't even think about parts of it without cringing, because it is actually that bad.  


I think that it would be more accurate to think of this idea as practice, not as just writing a bunch of novels. With every sentence you write, you learn about your style, your story, the practice and the craft of writing. You can write 4 novels, or a hundred poems, or one novel and no poems. Whatever you are writing that is helping you to grow but is what that ""unpublishable"" first would be is valuable and important practice, in my view.   


My first novel is what I now lovingly call the plotless wonder, because it is messy and there is a description of a garden somewhere in there that is literally a list of about 20 species of flower. I learned about how to write better descriptions, and I learned how to write dialogue and characters because I just wrote it. I'm glad I started when I did because I didn't have a nasty inner critic in high school. I can see in that manuscript leaps and bounds in my ability to make the words go. From the beginning to the end, the style and the complexity changes drastically. Is it readable? Barely, and only by my best friend. Is it valuable? Yes, and I love it for that reason. It's garbage as far as ""publishable"", but it was and is something that I will never ever regret doing because it made me the writer that I am now. I am currently working on my second novel, and I can see the lessons I learned showing up all the time.   


Keep at it! You can do this! And remember, you are an artist, and your journey is different from everyone else's. If it were any other way, we wouldn't have the incredible variety we do. :)"
