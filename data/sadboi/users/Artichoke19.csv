hikikomori,fr12xz6,t1_fr0yejj,1589812227.0,"Honestly dude I’m not disagreeing with you about the technical criteria or definition of a hikikomori. You’re right. It’s more than just the first paragraph. In fact you’ve educated me on how there’s more to it and how there’s even overlap with learning difficulties/autism spectrum disorders and how it’s life-long and not just an u fortunate ‘phase’ etc. 

However despite that I think we just aren’t quite on the same page about how that translates into people participating in a sub like this one. 

Yes there’s a difference between just ‘feeling’ hiki and ‘BEING’ hiki but even then it’s like...how bad and for how long does it have to be before anyone takes your story/suffering seriously? Do we dismiss people as not being hiki enough if they’ve been dependent on their parents for 2 years, while many others have been for decades? Is a hiki with Aspergers more hiki than one without? 

It’s a can of worms that ultimately suffers the same fate as all identity politics tend to by layering everyone into a hierarchical progressive stack of victim-hood. Personally it’s not useful because of the ‘No True Scotsman’ fallacy and how that plays out practically. In simpler terms - when people’s lives are as bad as they are when they’re anything like hikikomori - it’s not useful to anyone to compete to see whose got it worse and it’s even less useful to use faulty logic to turn people away from participating.

This is honestly why while I DO agree with you about it being a misused word in the English language, I feel that we **should** still be using it until something better and more precise comes along. 

Until then, in the context of having an easily discovered place online like a Reddit sub that people from all over the English speaking globe can come to for info/advice etc - the term IS useful. As long as they’re not abusing anyone or being a jerk. 

We should keep our hearts and minds open to people who have the multitude of problems alongside and associated with this social phenomenon. Yes it’s categorically frustrating if they’ve bounced around subs and are seeking feedback by posting here, but again my argument is just one of tolerance and moderation for the poor lost souls who come here in the first place. Even coming out from lurking could be a crucial first step for someone and I’d hate it if they felt ignored or dismissed because they aren’t hiki enough in some member’s eyes. 

By all means, let’s brainstorm ideas for what we can refer to ‘hikikomori’ as in the English speaking world/developed West. Perhaps others have already tried inventing a new word? Subs like this could be useful for things like that too. 

Thanks for writing such a long and considered response and I wish you well. 

I’d still encourage people to listen to users like you for a fuller, more precise understanding of the origins of the term. We can all move on from there."
NEET,fr0wvpm,t1_fr0w69l,1589808608.0,"I’m still happy to help him - I helped him move house recently and I speak to him for hours and hours on the phone when he’s having a damascene moment, realises what a prick he is, feels really depressed and needs someone to listen. I have a working conscience. He’s a human being too. 

Don’t worry, I know where to draw the line. I’ve hung up on him before when he’s being too stubbornly negative and I’ve flat-out told him he’s blowing everything wrong in his life out of proportion so that he doesn’t have to accept any responsibility or blame for why. 

I’m just having to be (reluctantly) hyper-vigilant against his more narcissistic abuses of trust (both large and small) and have as much patience towards the symptoms of his disorder as I’d expect to be given to me."
NEET,fr0tgrv,t1_fr0sozz,1589806325.0,"Thank you. I know I might sound like I’m still bitter (and in some respects, because my brother still behaves like a self-involved, passive-aggressive asshat towards me I find it difficult to maintain forbearance) but ultimately it’s taught me a very important lesson about how even close family members will look down their nose at you if you’re on welfare but not ‘poor’.

It’s almost like they don’t resent you being on disability so long as you’re borderline destitute, suffering and can barely afford anything. Buy yourself a PlayStation or keep a car on the road and suddenly you’re the scum of the earth."
hikikomori,fr0t1ds,t1_fr0rw80,1589806016.0,"It’s less about myself and more about how other people can participate and help others feel less alone. Otherwise what’s a place like this for?

I’m not too bothered about ‘fitting-in’ as much as I am concerned about the sub having the social bandwidth so others can come here to listen to other people’s stories and (if appropriate or solicited) give support and advice. Perhaps even help get some to a better place and reclaim their lives.

OK if you’re going to exclude NEETs and/or the socially isolated then at the very least, there needs to be space and allowances for former or recovering hikikomoris/long-term agoraphobes to come here, give their perspective/two cents and help others feel heard and/or try lifting other people’s spirits.

There’s too much overlap in the Venn diagram of depression/anxiety/agoraphobia/social isolation/being a NEET for people to not recognise that being a hikikomori is part of the same modern social disease. 

Yes modern capitalist materialist society affects us all differently but that doesn’t mean this sub/community can’t be made stronger by having members with a diversity of experience. 

As long as people are kind and respectful in their replies and their posts (and not shit-posting) then isn’t it fair enough for anyone to come here?"
hikikomori,fr0r64y,t1_fr0qcvh,1589804630.0,"Only if we are all super-pedantic and gate-keep communities like this. 

There are introverts who perform to thousands of people on stage for a living as comedians, singers and actors. 

There are socially isolated people who ostensibly ‘like’ being isolated, are simply just elderly and widowed or alternately they’re living in crowded homes/cities, are constantly having to interact with family/others yet still feel socially isolated. 

If we are to be that strict about who gets to participate in the r/hikikomori community then perhaps r/NEET might be better. I myself are part of both. But even that’s fraught with the same problems discerning between people who are NEET because their lives are terrible and/or have mental health issues and people who just happen to be NEET but are happy and don’t have lives anything like an agoraphobe or a hiki."
NEET,fr0prud,t1_fr0ouqn,1589803526.0,"Haha yep. He’s fundamentally incapable of long-term planning and predicting consequences. 

I do love my brother and I do still feel bad for him but even though he has a mental health issue/a cluster B personality disorder it’s still no reason for him to behave as badly as he has but he keeps excusing himself and carrying on as if the other people he burns are just ‘jealous’. 

I mean, I have even more severe and long-lasting mental health problems and a personality disorder of my own, too (in fact I have more than one!) - so I *could* make all the same excuses he did/does but I still wouldn’t DARE borrow money off a close friend/family member, promise to pay them back then ultimately refuse to out of sheer jealousy and resentment the moment they ask for it back. 

Just as a tag to this - I was on the phone to him recently and he was moaning about how some of his oldest, closest friends from childhood still hadn’t paid him back money he‘d leant them 2 or 3 years ago. Karma has a brilliant sense of humour. Got to give it that!"
NEET,fr0oe6n,t3_glvj2u,1589802375.0,"I’ve had my younger brother use language like this before. When he borrowed money off me for some expensive shoes then refused to pay me back - he said because the money I leant to him was from Disability Welfare then it ‘wasn’t [my] money’ that I just ‘sit on my arse all day’ and had a ‘funny attitude’ in asking for it back - even though he’d promised to do so at the time. He kept making excuses then sent me a long manipulative email making out that by asking for the money back it was more about my mental health condition flaring up and ‘taking out my depressive anger on him’ than it was about him just being dishonest and not paying me back what he’d promised. 

I’m continuing to have the last laugh somewhat - because after we’d had an argument over him not paying me back I told him that he’d ‘get what’s coming to him’ - he accused me of making a threat (like I was going to hit him or vandalise his car or something), and my response was - *‘I don’t have to DO anything - karma will do its thing given time’* 

So cut to a few years later and my brother was complaining about needing money to progress his modelling ‘career’, pay-off debts on an expensive road-bicycle and pay for himself to impress a girl he’d been friends with for years and take her on holiday. He sat in my car telling me that even though she lived hundreds of miles away and never saw him IRL ‘he loved her’ but he didn’t think he ‘should have to’ make any sacrifices like selling his more valuable possessions to fund this grand romantic gesture. He went to the bank to try and get a loan and was refused. I was actually there at the bank with him knowing the whole time what was going to happen. It was just delicious to actually see it. I saw him calling up loan sharks and stressing out because to get any credit at all he’d need a guarantor. 

The satisfying thing for me was that because I’d continued living frugally and not spending all my NEETbux - I had several thousand in my savings account that I could have EASILY leant him. I could have instantly given him what he felt he needed to bail him out of his debts and also what he wanted to help give him a shot with taking this girl that he proclaimed love for on some sort of holiday. But I kept quiet. I didn’t let him know just how secretly stuffed my long-term savings account was. If I did he’d just get resentful and think he had a superior moral claim to it than I had. 

I mean I want my brother to be happy and all - it’s just I won’t let disrespect like that stand - there were several comparable incidents of him treating me like utter shit over the years after that but nonetheless - in isolation if he hadn’t been so immature and cruel about paying me back I would have LOVED to have loaned him every penny he needed - but sadly now I don’t see why I should shoulder so much risk after he’d screwed me over and insulted me for being on benefits and concurrently financially responsible enough not to spend every penny and actually save. 

He’ll never know how much he lost out on that summer - how much I edited his timeline through inaction. I was right in the end - he got what was coming to him and all I had to do was exactly what I said I’d do - NOTHING. I just sat back, kept my mouth shut and didn’t offer him the help he thought he was cosmically entitled to. 

Aside from the occasional tenner or any other small amount I can just shrug off as a tax on having a narcissistic, selfish dickhead for a sibling I have resolved to NEVER help my younger brother out with any meaningful amount of money ever, ever again. It’s just not going to happen. 

And he’s done it to himself for having the attitude that people on disability are ‘deadbeats’ or ‘sponges’."
hikikomori,fr0gcsl,t1_fr0fq15,1589794666.0,"I agree in principle however like I said we can’t dismiss and reject people from online communities if they’re are suffering from almost all of the same symptoms but not the full-set. 

By all means be super-precise if you’re a sociologist, medical professional or politician addressing the issue based on that specific label, but within reason I think it’s not hyperbole for someone to self-describe as hiki if they meet all the criteria except shitting/pissing in bottles. 

And like I said - until the moment a new or better term for English-speaking ‘hiki’ becomes available and in common use, hiki is more precise than the more versatile terms like recluse, shut-in or hermit."
hikikomori,fr0f1z4,t3_glx4p5,1589793319.0,"Yes, in the strictest definition of the word, a hiki is only Japanese and in the most extreme agoraphobic, unhygienic and socially withdrawn state imaginable.

However at least in terms of how people suffering from similar agoraphobic and mental illness-related social/reclusive symptoms, we need to be understanding, inclusive and keep the door open for people to reach out and seek comfort and understanding from others even if they are technically incorrect to self-describe as hikikomori. 

I.e. Just because in the English speaking Western societies we don’t yet have a commonly-used specific term doesn’t mean that there aren’t many people who meet most of the criteria and need the same help and support as a full-blown Japanese-style hiki."

limerence,fqsvqfk,t3_gkmwa6,1589620594.0,"For me it’s kind of farcical and I try to laugh at how ridiculous it is that I still think about her on a daily basis. 

She’s somebody who I still speak to on Instagram. We haven’t actually met properly IRL but we did kind-of cross paths on public transport. 

The last time I saw her she was sitting in the shelter at a crowded train station bus stop in late 2018. 

I felt really self-conscious about my weight/looks/ability to form proper words in the English language so I didn’t approach her and let her know I was the guy she’s been talking to online. 

Also I would have stank to high heaven of the McDonalds I’d just depressively binge-eaten.  

It was a deer in the headlights moment and I still internally die inside every time I think about it.

It gets in my head because that was the SECOND time that had happened. Earlier in 2018 I was riding on a bus and she’d come in and sat across the aisle adjacent to me and fireworks were going off in my head the entire 10 minutes before I got off at my stop first. 

I didn’t introduce myself then either because I rightly knew how fucking creepy that would have been for her having some obese weirdo talk to her in a situation she couldn’t easily escape from. 

So yeah...everything happens in threes, right? I tell myself that if the universe/simulation sees fit to put myself and her in the same place at the same time for a THIRD time then it’s shit or bust for me. 

If I can’t find the courage to speak to her and risk her being disgusted at the sight of me/creeped out at my social retardation and inability to be charming and attractive then I’m just going to have to disconnect and go total, actual NC with her and only invest emotional resources if she ever reaches out to me without my prompting. It would just hurt too much to be rejected by her in person.

Edit: Also I just used my Sherlock Holmes sleuthing skills (aka internet stalking) and I think I’ve figured out who her new love interest is in the city she lives in (NYC) and that she’s probably already sleeping with him. I hope it’s just my crazy imagination."

NEET,fqpfmv3,t1_fqp3kll,1589545153.0,"I really feel for you bro. I’ve been through some of the same shit you describe. 

I’m in the UK too and the benefits/welfare system here is no joke, they’ve fucked it up badly for pretty much an entire decade and it’s not getting any better and probably won’t until Labour are voted back into power. In a more fair and just world you wouldn’t be required to jump through the hoops you’re being asked to. 

However there ARE some things that you can do for yourself in little tiny baby steps that over time, if sustained (I’m talking over months, possibly years) could help lift your spirits up and help you  reclaim your life, more dignity and a healthier self-identity. 

I’ll give you the same advice I gave my younger brother when he was in a similar position with his benefits  - Don’t think of the bullshit bureaucratic nonsense things you ‘need’ to do for Universal Credit as unfair hoops to jump through but rather opportunities to do favours for yourself and rise above a small challenge. 

Your grandparent/parent sound like nice people that understand you and love you. I’m sure that if you asked they could help you with whatever it takes to get you what you need to conform your identity on paper and get all the necessary things (like a National Insurance number if you didn’t have one) sorted etc.  

As for not going outside for 11 years...fuck. That sounds rough. I am so sorry that you’ve felt so low that this has been your reality. I went through a really bad reclusiveness/hiki phase a few years back. I didn’t leave the house for months and months at a time and that felt bad enough. I honestly thought I’d messed my life up and my destiny was to LDAR. 

Eventually I was able to go out to see the shrink at my local hospital and then later go on shopping trips to the supermarket with my mother who would drag me out. I’d have panic attacks in the aisles of Tesco - I’d get overwhelmed by the general overload of stimuli - people looking at me in the eye (even if just briefly, phones going off, babies crying, the store tannoy system, the incessant beeps from the tills, all the visual chaos with the products on the shelves - brands names and pictures and price tags all a walloping reminder that on a fundamental level our entire lives revolve around this system maintaining equilibrium. Seriously. When you’re mentally ill and in a fragile state - shopping is STRESS-FULL! 

I was able to start going out to my weekly psychiatrists appointments on the bus. There was a bus-stop opposite my flat and I ordered some big over-ear noise-cancelling headphones. I would get in the bus, sit down, close my eyes and play meditation/ambient music while I travelled to keep myself calm and not dwell on negative thoughts (or overwhelming stimuli on the bus) before getting to my destination. 

Eventually after a few months I was able to keep my eyes open the whole journey. I’d learn to enjoy looking out the window and taking in the view of the fields and buildings. Even if it was grim weather. 

As for the job stuff...well, I’m still unemployed and I still don’t know what the hell I’m supposed to do with myself to earn money and not feel suicidal in a horrible stressful job. I don’t know what to say about that. 

All I can say though is that there IS light at the end of the tunnel. Another thing that might help you is to conceive of your life like a video game and you’re mother-fucking Gerald of Rivia and you’re earning precious XP and ability points the more you do (no matter how slowly or seemingly incrementally). 

You could make yourself a tiered to-do list:

• **Immediate short-term goals** - that you *could* do right now if you wanted. Things like tidying your room, washing your clothes, etc

• **Medium term goals** - stuff that you know you can only do ‘later’ once certain other criteria have been met and you’re feeling better about doing them. Things like sorting your identity documents and Universal Credit out, leaving the house once or twice a week for a walk with your parent etc, possibly even taking a calculated risk and reaching out to some old friends and if that isn’t possible seeing if there’s any opportunities in your area to join a hobby or support group of some sort - whatever you’re into or whatever you find it develop an affinity for. You get to decide this, you’ll encounter 90% stuff you may not want to get involved in but given time you’ll come across something. 

• **Long-term ‘life’ things** - this is the hardest one and potentially triggering so don’t do this one unless you’re feeling well enough to do it, but write down some things that you’d like your entire life to have eventually in several years time (at least 5 years) or after a few decades. Things like your ideal job, where you’d like to live in the country or the world, creative ambitions like writing a novel or making an indie game, whether you’d ever like to have kids etc. Only write that stuff down if you honestly believe it. But it’s a good ting to envision a brighter, happier future for yourself. 

Have you heard of a ‘eucatastrophe’? It’s a word JRR Tolkien invented to describe when victory is snatched from the jaws of imminent defeat. I believe there’s a eucatastrophe waiting to happen inside the mind of every depressed person. It just has to be encouraged out of its shell. The reason why depression is so fucking difficult to treat and/or cure is because the way you coax that eucatastrophe out different for all of us. There is no one-size fits all solution. 

Ok sorry for writing such a long response, I hope I’ve been helpful and I apologise if I got anything wrong or made assumptions about your situation. 

I wish you all the best man. Just take recovery one day at a time and don’t hate yourself if some days you can’t help yourself. Just keep chipping away and don’t be afraid to ask for help 👍🏻"

I was always very susceptible to low energy and depressive periods which ultimately tested people’s patience and made me an easy target. Especially when I was in a customer-facing position like barista in a cafe. I couldn’t fight back from fear of disciplinary actions and losing livelihood. I felt suicidal all the time from the moment I woke up to the moment my head hit my pillow.
If it wasn’t oppression from individuals bullying me it was from the crushing boredom of the tasks not being sufficiently engaging enough to distract me from terrible intrusive thoughts. Not to mention how technology-facilitated surveillance in some jobs I’ve had made me feel like a rat in a cage.

Being NEET now on disability welfare for major mental health issues for the past 5.5 years hasn’t exactly made the suicidal thoughts totally go away, but at least now I’m not being bullied by impatient and judgemental colleagues.

There’s some dignity in knowing that I’m not volunteering myself for that kind of bullshit just so I can have a roof over my head and food in my stomach.

HOWEVER 

I’m not entirely sure it’s helpful to gate-keep these definitions too keenly here as it’s obviously a global social phenomenon.

I think what i’m trying to say is a withdrawn shut-in NEET, male or female, young or old, lonely and hurting whether they’re in West Virginia USA or Minsk, Russia is just as valid as one in Sapporo or Nagasaki or Tokyo. 

Some countries/governments just haven’t caught up with normalised/appropriate language and terminology just yet. 

The central issue is still the same and one that we shouldn’t lose sight of - Yes, they’re labels and yes, they’re helpful for medical and sociological professionals but in terms of being an identity or ‘subculture’? People need to be able to join online communities like this and be able to share freely and find help/support without being even further ostracised by society for not being hiki enough. We’re all different. We need to be patient. We need to be kind. 

I would now consider myself a recovering ‘western hiki’ who while is technically (by OP’s definition) NEET, is still 50-75% ‘hiki’ and still suffering from many or most of the same accompanying mental and social issues. 

Every day is still a struggle. I sometimes come here to try to support people and encourage and let people know there’s hope and light at the end of the tunnel and talk about what’s helped me and how I’m slowly recovering.

I need a lot of support and encouragement. I simply cannot give myself adequate positive reinforcement because my default self-worth and self-esteem has historically been in the gutter. 

Recently a few friends have reached out to help me which has helped me feel a bit more positive this week. The upswing of a woman I really like paying me a small amount of attention and an childhood friend asking how I’m doing had a temporary magical effect on among me feel loved and appreciated.

ifiwonthelottery,fp0ah37,t1_fp0858z,1588205526.0,"Yeah exactly - if you make it known loud and clear that your rule is that everyone gets the same amount each should they ask for it - a single one time lump-sum payment - to do with as they wish (investment, mortgage, college funds, holidays, cars, sex and drugs etc) and not a single penny more then you can at least rest easy that you’re not fomenting competition or resentment amongst people. 

I think £10k per person is fair as it’s a 5-figure sum and not an insulting low gift like, say, £103. 

Perhaps a good metric as a gift could be the current year’s average salary of £30k per person Not a massive amount at all but enough to significantly improve most people’s lives. Plus it sounds better saying you gave away a year’s salary than X amount. A year’s salary sounds more meaningful.

I’d help people sure but ANONYMOUSLY through charities both large and small they provide regular people with food and resources and yes I would give A LOT. At least £1m and that would just be for starters (obviously not if all I won was £1m. Then I’d be more sensible and give a healthy percentage but not all of it. I’m honest enough to admit that I’m still a greedy individual human who wants to give away lots of cash and STAY rich haha)!

Case in point - the charity that a family member of mine works for almost went under this week due to mass cancellations of fundraising events and other overheads and debts mounting up etc. A patron of the charity donated them £100k anonymously and it will mean the charity will now survive until 2021. If they’d made a big song and dance over their generosity they’d just be inundated with begging letters from other worthy causes and that person won’t be able to be as generous to all of them. 

It’s like a parent giving their 2 children an allowance. They give them the money as a gift given equally to help but it one child is given £10 and the other gets £12 then the one given £10 will feel cheated and resent the parent and their sibling. So you either give equally or not at all."

Great cast (strong female characters, iconic side-characters), silly irreverent humour, with quite wholesome moments amidst the japes.

Has cutaway fantasy sequences but they’re not as dumb as Family Guy, they’re usually pretty goofy. 

A good reason to discover (or rediscover) Scrubs now is because the show’s stars Zach Braff and Donald Faison recent started a rewatch podcast. You can watch along and hear behind the scenes tidbits as you go. Obviously you’d be limited by the pace they record new episodes. 

It isn’t on Netflix but it’s easy enough to find free streams you can watch in your browser.

I found Tony doing what he did to be evil because he just didn’t care enough to do the obvious morally right thing. Instead he made a choice. One he probably knew was a repugnant one, but he made it anyway because he was so depressed.

The only other way to look at Tony’s actions is even worse - he did it to scratch an itch - he was too cowardly to kill himself but curious enough to follow through on vicariously killing himself on heroin when presented with the opportunity.

Season 2 spoilers: >!The fact that Tony enabling Julian to OD is completely forgotten about and the amateur dramatics director guy/mother and son being terrible human beings just reinforces how mean-spirited the show’s humour is. None of it works. It’s so tonally jarring with the otherwise earnest attempts at heartfelt drama in the show that it just makes me wish it was a straight drama.
