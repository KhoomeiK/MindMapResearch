Thanks."
depression,f9cbg97,t3_e4b9k9,1575221570.0,I can relate to you op. It took us 13 years after moving to the US for us to have decent jobs and our own house. The one thing I could always do to help my parents out were chores. It makes a huge difference coming home to a clean house or apartment. I never had a gf since I was too embarassed about my family's situation and it has had a pretty big scar on my self esteem. Depression does suck when you're poor. I like to think of underdog heroes from tv shows. It helps me be somewhat proud or brave or whatever of my situation.

LogicPro,eqf7wpq,t3_bxzjin,1560016527.0,I don't know your skill level but the mixdown is usually the case for this issue. Are there too many instruments playing around the same frequency range? Is your bass too loud? Drums too loud? I would import a professionally released track similar sounding to yours into Logic and compare its frequencies with yours. You can use Logic's stock multimeter or use Voxengo Span (free and more detailed). A well mixed track can reach commercial standard loudness without a hassel.
