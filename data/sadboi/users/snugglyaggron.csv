fountainpens,fqk7rzu,t3_gho5vy,1589421783.0,"Complete stranger to fountain pens, and I know this is an *extraordinarily* long shot - but is there a chance that any of you could help me find a pen or some pens that match the description of or are close to the description of a fictional fountain pen?

[It's an item fittingly just called ""Fountain Pen""](https://endlessocean.fandom.com/wiki/Fountain_Pen), from a video game called Endless Ocean. You play as a scuba diver who can interact with fish and find treasures in a fictional sea in the South Pacific called Manoa Lai; one of the treasures is the Fountain Pen. I'm an editor for the game's wiki, and I like having as much (pertinent) information in the articles as possible, so even anything remotely close for me to go off of would be a huge help.

Its in-game description in the North American version states: ""*A limited-edition English fountain pen, of which there are less than 30 in the world. It is gold plated*."" In the European version, it is described with: *""No more than thirty of these elegant British-made pens are said to exist. Partly gold-plated.""* There are pictures in the article that I linked, but they're images from the game with very limited views of the pen itself. Even information about visual aspects of the pen (apparent construction material, observations about the nib, etc.) would be greatly appreciated.

I'm not expecting an exact match, considering that this game's treasures generally lean into only a nugget of realism with fiction built around it (a shell from a kind of Murex snail that doesn't exactly match any real Murex snails, a set of extremely rare coins specified to be from a time period and place not known for rare coins, etc.). Nonetheless, like I said - if there are any that are even a little close, or look/sound similar, I would absolutely love to know."

there's also a sequel that's WAY more expansive than the original and improves upon it in a LOT of ways, so a lot of people prefer the sequel (including me) but the first game came out when i was like 7 and i didn't even know there was a second one until like 2012 so i've got massive nostalgia for it
