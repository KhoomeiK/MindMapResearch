For example, many biological processes work as though they are man made machinery in a factory - e.g. DNA transcription and translation. See if visualising these concepts as a factory assembly line, or other processes as cartoons or whatever, helps you better understand them. Like someone already said here, aim to ultimately explain it (to yourself, for starters, if not to others). Hope this helps!
