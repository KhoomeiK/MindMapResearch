SGExams,fh7qr7q,t3_f1oupq,1581342087.0,"reading itself is one thing but actually applying them into ur essays to support ur views is another case imo. it's good to know more but honestly not really necessary if you have certain topics u prefer writing. i also feel it's easier to remember/be aware of news that u can actually use bc you're more int in it and won't feel forced to actually memorise it. personally i just read latest news on straits times. if u wanna memorise manually such as statistics u can google them as well (eg % jobs replaced by AI in a certain sector etc etc) but i don't think it's really necessary...... building an 'example bank' works differently for everyone i guess. also for q3, no as gp questions don't just base on local context only, unless they mention ""in your society""

 at the end of the day for p1 it's most impt to use examples that are RELEVANT to ur points and support them, and not just blindly vomit them out esp when it has nth to do w the body para"

SGExams,feimqd1,t1_feihlxx,1579142149.0,"jpjc has good pw distinction rates despite being a lower tier jc and i'd say the cohort is generally motivated to do well/gets pushed by lecturers n teachers. not sure about current batch but we had a pretty strict promo criteria back then. if you think about it they really wanna make sure we get our j1 foundation right before taking alvls the following year, which is p good in making sure we don't f up lol. all in all i don't think it's good to continue having this negative mindset towards lower tier jcs bc even if you're suay like me and get classmates who are the slack kind, it's still on you whether you get influenced by them or not. and it also definitely gets competitive nearing the exams periods so generally it isn't an issue imo... also if you have a relatively better score than the cop you may enter a banded class with better teachers and studying envt in general. not saying that other teachers are bad but there's always a fair share of bad and good teachers in every jc. also adding on, honestly i don't think it's good to compare jc and poly as they're different curriculums on a whole. imo if you already know what you're interested in, i'd say just go to poly... generally less stressful + diploma (can still find job even if u don't do well unlike alvl cert) + internship opportunities etc. even 3.5 gpa can get you into local unis nowadays, but also depending on which course u want lah. tldr at the end of the day your atttiude still matters the most no matter which institution you go to so atb fam"
