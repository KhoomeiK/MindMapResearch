When I finally felt up to it - meaning I had successfully tapered and quit and was into an exercise program and really doing the best I could, I started offering support.

ChronicPain,fplm5n2,t3_ge5p1q,1588715215.0,"From other posts I have read in other chronic pain forums, make sure that the trial device is the actual device they will be implanting. Apparently it’s not uncommon for the trial device to be different than the one a patient sometimes actually receives and some patients don’t get the same level or relief they had with the trial device - just a question to ask your doc.

I don’t blame you for feeling pressured. I was at a pain rehab hospital and they tried to talk me into a nerve ablation. 

I went to get a second and third opinion I learned that those can actually be more painful than the original pain. No thanks.

Many times Dr’s only have so many options for patients and in their quest to alleviate the pain, can actually make matters worse (unintentionally Bc some of the SCS and ablations do help some patients). So I think it’s a system wide thing - if that helps at all. (One of my dr’s told me that - in the hopes of trying to help their patients they try everything - even if that means the patient might not get the relief they were expecting). 

Ask lots of questions. Also, there are genetic tests for pain meds that run about $250. Maybe you could try that to ensure you’re on the right medication for you genetic profile. I can’t metabolize tramadol and a few other meds - made a big difference in how my pain medication worked when I got that test.

Best of luck to you and I hope that other folks with actual experience with SCS chime in and offer you some good advice!"

How did your ablation go and what method did your dr use? 

I’m considering having one Bc every few months I’m anemic from the month of bleeding. 

When you say you had “great results” I’m assuming that no complications and either your period stopped or got much lighter? Was the ablation painful? I found the D&C to be very easy with very little pain.
If you care to share, I would appreciate it. I’m on HRT Bc it helps my mental health and I’m also 53 so I know I can’t stay on HRT forever - without having higher risks for cancer.

Yes, facet pain is a special kind of hell and now that I’m over the worst of it (this is my hope at least)I am trying to retrain my brain to not avoid activities that trigger it and not to over compensate by getting anxiety around a little bit of discomfort thinking it will spiral into something like a flare - like standing in the kitchen, etc...

I hope you are able to get relief bc I know all too well how fatiguing and frustrating it can be. 

I would do both procedures again in a heartbeat even though they were both expensive and took months of downtime to heal - the long term gains were worth the short term sacrifices.  I had to give up a lot of my favorite activities and a few I’m not sure I’ll be able to go back to just due to the nature of the stress they put on my lumbar joints, but I will take that over dealing with the awful unrelenting pain any day.

My hope is that you too can find something that brings your pain levels down. I wouldn’t say I’m completely cured or 100% pain free, but so much better that I’m likely going to drop one of my meds this week - comfortably. 

Perhaps you will find PRP to help your facet joints - if you decide to go that route. The first three weeks you think you made a mistake, but by week four and five it’s completely different.

Yes, PT made my issues worse - oddly enough- I spent nearly three years in PT and I ended up with sciatica- but now I’ve learned that there are just some things PT is good for and some, not so much.

My advice would to be to spend 12.00 (if you can) on a grams scale from Amazon (or if you know someone who would lend you one, use that) and weigh/measure your intake and keep it to a minimal in terms of grams so you’re not getting high Bc it will make it harder to quit. 

When it’s time to taper  off and/or stop (whatever you decide) you can use your measuring to ensure you’re going down on your intake instead of eyeballing it with a measuring spoon.

ChronicPain,foy3ex4,t3_ga0vkh,1588164338.0,"Sounds like you have some of your answers re:ablation and more shots.
I was able to get a pretty good amount of relief from my severely degenerative lumbar facet syndrome from using biological therapy- platelet rich plasma.
It is out of pocket - not FDA approved, the first two weeks you are pretty sore and inflammed, but that is normal and part of the healing process.

If your PM doc doesn’t offer this, you may want to consider an orthopedic Dr or spine surgeon as a lot of practices are beginning to offer this service to patients along with bone marrow stem cell transplants into the area. I had both - it was financially a bit difficult, but my pain which had me practically bed ridden last year (being the worst year) is down to a 2 for the most part now. 

I just had the PRP treatment on all my lumbar facets and a bulging torn L5/S1 disc and I’m at about 5 weeks post procedure- I am really blown away at how well this treatment has so far worked.

Had a lot of steroids myself and was offered ablation - my Doc said no way to ablation- would be a lifetime sentence and steroids over time just are no good for you. 

I hope this helps and I know your pain! At least you may be able to know that they are making strides in this type of treatment - My husband and I almost went to Mayo Bc my pain was so bad and literally Mayo is offering this same treatment now - so my point is - Mayo is a center of excellence and maybe there is information you can gain by searching online for these possibilities for you too. 

Good luck!"
ChronicPain,foxq48u,t3_ga0pxm,1588152330.0,"I have found amazing relief from steroids too! You might see if you can stay on a very low dose for awhile- I don’t know what your milligrams were or type, but once I took 1mg once or twice a day for a bit over a month and it helped tremendously. 

Ask your doc- obviously there are risks involved, but it can’t hurt to ask and see if that would be something you could do - or even an every other day or two day low dose. 
Might just need to monitor your blood so your adrenals are ok, etc... but my doc let me take a medrol pack like this and it really helped get more mileage out of the medication and when my pack was over, obviously the pain returned, but not as horrible.

But I can wean myself off - I’ve taken them for over 15 years - can’t say that I notice them making much of a difference for me anymore and I’m in my early 50’s."
