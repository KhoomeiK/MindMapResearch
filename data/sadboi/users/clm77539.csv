BPD,ew98919,t1_ew6dauy,1565221190.0,"Extremely hard. While my pwBPD has not said that to me the things he usually says are things he knows will cut deep. For instance something that happened recently that mentally Im still working thru was something that was very important to me he (kind of) ignored and he knew how important it was and when I told him how upset I was he had an IDC attitude and I said ""It was important to me"" and he said quickly back ""well its not to me"" and he knows the significance of the event to me so it was more than just not really acknowledging it, because he had gotten me a little gift to remember a couple days before that day, but was upset with me on that day so didn't say anything to me. But for him to say that after knowing what Ive been thru and how very much it means felt like he ripped my heart from my chest. It was actually the single most hurtful thing he has said to me bcz it was so deeply personal. But knowing what I know, about him and about BPD do I think he truly meant what he said. No. That's the simple answer. I think in that moment he meant to hurt me bcz he was upset with me and I was telling him how I felt and pwBPD's do not do emotion well, especially if they know they hurt you. That forces them to disassociate as a defense mechanism. When they do that they don't look at you the same. There is no feelings behind their words. Some of them don't even really remember everything becz it can be almost out of body. But with therapy they can learn to control that, and learn the triggers and stop things before they happen. If his non-BPD side wasn't so amazing and wonderful I would've been gone a long time ago."

BPD,ew2roqa,t3_cmcxi6,1565054165.0,"Wow, reading the post I immediately thought here is one I can answer, until I tried to find the words to type here. When trying to think about how I feel hearing him say the things he's said during one of his episodes I felt an overwhelming wave of equal parts pain and sadness.  Literally almost took my breath away for a second and my heart started to race. But here's the thing when I think about how he makes me laugh, how he when he's having a good day he remembers little things about me, a place I mentioned in passing several months before, a movie I said I wanted to see, a restaurant I said I wanted to try, and goes out of his way to make me feel special in his own way. What Im getting at is the only reason it hurts me so deeply is because how much I love him and how happy he makes me on the good days. Here is what I know to be true, hurt people hurt people. The root of BPD is planted firmly in pain and abandonment. So it is either one or the other. There is no in between. He loves me or he hates me. Rest assured this will be very hard for anyone else to understand. Even though I know about BPD, I know a lot of what's said is said during rage episodes, splitting, or completely dissociated. And that completely irrational overreactions to situations that seem small and insignificant to the rest of us are the norm for pwBPD.  That knowledge does help process the things that are said or done and attempt to separate the 2 extreme personalities but I can assure you when someone you love or care about deeply is able to look at you and say things that reach inside your soul and rip it apart without blinking it hurts all the same.  The advice I can give you is to learn your triggers, learn the things that ground you and calm you and when you need to remove yourself. These are skills you will have to learn and practice. Download the free PDF version of  DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets. And also the Borderline Personality Disorder for Dummies. Both with help you learn the signs and the skills to put into practice to help you retrain your brain to deal with things rationally.  Just dont think of yourself as a bad person, just a person that never learned the right way to feel emotion or how to handle it. Its not an excuse to say or do things but it gives you a clear cause and effect and the solution to fix it!"

It just means that no matter how small the % some pwBPD and the people who love them had a slightly better outcome. ANd I should state as well that the more positive outcome is not with out hard work and dedication to the process. I understand that is not the outcome for everyone, and BTW thats a good thing!"

BPDlovedones,ew22x2a,t1_ew21hfi,1565037035.0,Its ok. I think people are mistaking me giving my perspective as ALSO a person who loves a pwBPD as discrediting what they have been thru. Just because I have a different experience doesn't lessen in anyway someone elses experience. I only want to point out that other people do have different experiences. Obviously BPD is not without the sharp edges but it is possible for a more positive outcome. I dont think there is anything wrong with giving someone a little hope and the full story.
BPDlovedones,ew21bz7,t1_ew20ja9,1565036038.0,"Just as I suspected, you guys will pick apart any response, fact or opinion that differs from your own. I suspect that it wont matter what I say, you have been hurt and hurt people hurt people. I am incredibly sorry for what you've gone thru. But it does not change what Ive said or make any less of a fact that there are people with BPD that can and will recover, that have and will have good relationships. Even if its not your experience. No one is minimizing your experience but sharing that I have a different experience. No relationship is without hardships, I believe it is a disservice to want to only give 1 perspective. The OP said ANY ADVICE WAS WELCOME."
BPDlovedones,ew206oc,t1_ew1zewp,1565035314.0,Yup
BPDlovedones,ew205ti,t1_ew1zoyd,1565035299.0,"Absolutely, I don't believe I said anything to contradict that. Please... absolutely share your story, its extremely unfortunate. Im just making the point to the OP that we dont want to mislead anyone into believing that BPD is a certain death diagnosis, and that the experiences listed while informative and helpful are just part of the story. People can and do recover and live productive lives and have loving relationships."
BPDlovedones,ew1zr7p,t1_ew1yg2f,1565035050.0,"Lol I would but it is obvious that only 1 sided advice is allowed here. That if anyone says anything that doesn't line up with your experiences or thoughts you will try to break it down and discredit them. This is toxic thinking. No one is telling you not to share your experiences, I simply said maybe we should give the whole picture too. That not 100% of pwBPD are alike and the outcomes will not all be the same. What I said is fact. So as not to mislead the OP"
BPDlovedones,ew1z3jr,t1_ew1xjxr,1565034650.0,"I agree and Im sorry you went through that. My point however is literally just that is your experience however bad it was, but it is not everyone's experience."
BPDlovedones,ew1yxei,t1_ew1xq7l,1565034543.0,Its better served anywhere were some one is asking for advice and support. Why would you only give 1 point of view? One side of the story?
BPDlovedones,ew1yeh3,t1_ew1x9di,1565034216.0,I do not know who this comment is in reference to? If it is directed towards me I do NOT have BPD. But I am in a very productive loving relationship with a pwBPD.
BPDlovedones,ew1wvh7,t1_ew1u0zo,1565033246.0,Yes I can understand that perspective after being in this sub a few weeks now and seeing all the negativity. Its very unfortunate.
BPDlovedones,ew1wm78,t1_ew1uep0,1565033083.0,"I am very aware of the research. However when you give someone advice I feel it is wise to make sure they understand that what you are saying is based on your personal experience but there is always a chance for recovery and possibly give some supportive advice that may assist them in finding resources for help towards recovery. I mean that is what we hope will happen right? Not certain doom? If there is a chance for help why would you not also point that out? It is helpful to share your experiences but please just make people aware that is all they are so people arent confused when you make it sound like there is no chance at all for any positive outcome. We know the odds are against pwBPD but lets not stack it against them, they are after all people too and no 2 are the same."
BPDlovedones,ew1vwg9,t1_ew1v688,1565032631.0,And with that I can absolutely agree.
BPDlovedones,ew1tr5y,t1_ew1szps,1565031265.0,Where did you find the 98% statistic? Can you link it?
BPDlovedones,ew1tkof,t1_ew1sjos,1565031149.0,You made this sound like abuse and being discarded were an absolute and there are no other options? That doesnt happen in every relationship with a pwBPD.
BPDlovedones,ew1t8if,t3_cmesq2,1565030933.0,"While I wouldnt say that it is easy, and definitely has its challenges it is entirely possible to be in a thriving relationship with a pwBPD. Each pwBPD is different and each relationship is different."

BPD,evr9ac8,t3_ckw9mb,1564703596.0,Great article! Really make sense
BPD,evr6zb1,t3_ckva1f,1564702564.0,"Well that really sums up the root of BPD, for the most part. BPD usually develops as a result of a childhood trauma, like abandonment by someone they trusted and loved. So when triggered the pwBPD often regresses back to that point as a child where their emotional development is stuck. 
As a toddler or young child we develop very strong emotional attachments to the people we are closest to, if something tragic happens during that period of time when they are so emotionally vulnerable like abandonment by the person or persons they trust and love they don't understand and will subsequently develop separation anxiety. Reacting the only way a young child knows how to, becoming impatient, easily frustrated, and unable to control their feelings. Consequently, toddlers/little kids are known to dissolve into tears, become fussy, whiney or throw a fit. Same basic behaviors adults with BPD resort to, when those fears of abandonment and other triggering emotions are set in motion by something someone close to them says or does. 

The good news for a pwBPD is that our brains are still capable of absorbing like a sponge and learning all those coping skills they didn't get as a child. 
So I want to emphasize there are treatments that help bring the pwBPD to the higher emotional IQ. Theycan overcome this. The brain is very moldable and can be reshaped with the right kind of treatment."

BorderlinePDisorder,evpsp1c,t3_ckpsiz,1564679545.0,"1st of all, hi! Glad you're reaching out! That's the 1st step after diagnosis is realizing you need help and then taking all the necessary steps to educate yourself and start doing the things it takes to get your life back from BPD. 
Typing Borderline personality disorder into google search will probably cause information overload. And also you really have to be careful, because BPD can cause a lot of pain and cause people diagnosed with it to do irreparable damage to people who love them if they dont get help there are a LOT of (understandably) jaded people out there that their only answer to anyone asking about how to handle or deal with their pwBPD is to tell them to GTFO immediately and never look back. They will say that they will never change, they are selfish self seeking and life sucking. And they are right! BUT there is treatment, and it does work IF AND ONLY IF the pwBPD chose to do it. Its a long hard process but so worth it for yourself, and everyone you love and who loves you, including future children and spouses etc... 

This is the book I always recommend! Its free to download this pdf version. It is for the pwBPD and their loved ones. Its extremely easy to read and understand and has everything you need to get started on your journey to a better life!

BPD,evo9a83,t3_ckk99s,1564641352.0,"Have you talked to your pwBPD to find out why they maybe arent spending as much time as you think they should be? Also are you completely sure that they arent educating themselves? For instance I know my pwBPD does his own version by reading post here on reddit or we watch videos together. Just because I dont actually see him doing it doesnt mean that he is not. And while I would say that I'm sure I do spend more time reading or looking up things, that is my choice, because I love him and I know that I play a very big part in his dealing with this disorder and eventually recovering from it. I do understand how hard it can be and how easy it can be to get discouraged, but dont give up. Keep educating yourself, and share the things your learning with him during times he is receptive to it. During times when they rage, dissociate, split etc... its imperative that we be the ones to remind them of who they are and that they are not alone and they are loved. Good job honestly for educating yourself, dont give up."

BPD,evnyjp3,t3_ckhg16,1564634852.0,"I have definitely seen this in my own pwBPD, but I also have read this several times across the boards commonly in pwBPD. I think it has to be some form of impulse control and maybe a little identity crisis sprinkled in there as well? Or possibly the hobbies/interest are an attempt to always keep your mind focused on something else as your way of zoning out / dissociating from the world - its a defense mechanism from having to deal with reality? And when you start to get bored you instinctively move on to something else to keep your mind busy? Maybe it is a way to relate to people/friends in a BPDs life? Also it is entirely possible it is a form of obsessive compulsive behavior for some? I tend to think it indicative of the unstable up and down childhood, and the black and white thinking that comes with BPD. I'm sure none of this helps really its just some thoughts Ive had about it watching my pwBPD go from one thing to the next."

BPD,evnrd8b,t3_ckimza,1564630569.0,"I have noticed across a few of the BPD forums that there does seem to be a thing with BPD and social media. I have read about them staying on it for long periods of time. I know on and off it has been something my pwBPD has done as well. I would imagine that social media also potential satisfies some of this object permanency stuff for them. When they are on it, it may create a false sense of people being there when they are not or having lots of friends and/or attention (i.e. likes and comments on pics or post). Also allows them to create a life they want others to see, attention seeking behavior. But the truth about BPD is that they really find themselves in many emotional paradoxes where social media may make them feel better in some ways and make them feel worse in other ways because it create issues in real life relationships too. But this is generally par for the course. So I think it probably goes both way."
