I'm extremely loud about my opinion about everything, my husband knows I will flat out tell him what I want and if I don't want something immediately. It would be reasonable for him to not worry as much about silences as long as I was responsive physically, but for someone who is shy or not comfortable with conflict (or saying no), it would require a different way of reading and getting consent in situations. We still check in on each other though because we want to make sure we're both enjoying ourselves. 

At the end of the day, this is why it's important to talk about consent outside of the bedroom. So that both partners can understand each other and what they are comfortable with, along with what to look out for. Talk about past experiences that have made them uncomfortable, and so on. 

And during sex, checking that your partner is actually enjoying themselves is just basic decency lest you become one of those partners that gets themselves off and leaves your partner hanging."

Literally no one had a contingency plan for this. Not businesses, not the government (although they should have), not schools, not hospitals. I feel like you are failing to see the big picture here. This is a once-in-a-lifetime (hopefully) catastrophe and a lot of the rhetoric I'm seeing here is just completely missing the magnitude of this event and getting caught up in the weeds.

I don't think it's the kids fault and I certainly believe they should be allowed to drop for a full refund (and I know not all places are doing that, but many are).

But this ""well I'm gonna get what I'm owed"" mentality is just absolutely destructive right now. Do you think people in offices should get paid more because they didn't sign on to work from home? What about project managers working twice as many hours trying to get their teams working from home in a way that makes sense? What about K-12 teachers who ALSO DID NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS? Or the MANY MANY parents who suddenly are finding themselves working full time from home while simultaneously being expected to home school their children full time. This is a crisis situation - the best we can do is just get by and understand that no one is operating at full capacity right now. The problem is your entire argument is so self-involved. Students are not the only ones suffering right now from all these changes.

I am far more concerned that the schools should be spending their time and energy making sure students have access to safe living spaces, access to technology, access to food kitchens (through the schools or elsewhere) than worried about whether they should get a partial refund because they didn't sign up for online classes, even though they are continuing in the class and getting credit for the class and the teacher is likely working their ass off to provide the best education they can under the circumstance."
college,fmp60df,t1_fmp1uuj,1586275081.0,">my university has put in minimal effort

To give you a different viewpoint on this, having worked at multiple colleges and universities, there's also a lot of incompetence and disorganization at some institutions. And I'm not saying this is a good reason to not be supporting students right now, but also know that there might be an out-of-control circus going on behind the curtains at your school that has less to do with effort and more to do with already existing organizational problems (these are the kinds of problems that can exist anywhere - businesses or education or government). 

It's really unfortunate, particularly in education when it directly affects students, and usually the students most at risk. But it was interesting when I made the shift from being a student to being an employee (and suddenly getting cc-ed on emails and attending meetings) and suddenly seeing that it wasn't that they weren't *trying* to do anything, it was that they were just *unable* to get anything done."
college,fmp10j7,t3_fwlhkk,1586272343.0,"Taking away the elite Ivy League schools (which very few students actually attend comparatively, and which I can't speak to as I've never attended one and don't know anything about their operating costs), what you seem to be proposing is overly simplified.

Let's run through a few scenarios:

You let students stay on campus and continue their education so that it's not ""sub-par""

1. We continue to have massive outbreaks, students get sick or infect faculty and staff.

You give partial refunds because classes are online, but don't cancel classes:

1. Nearly the entire university or college is still working from home to do their jobs remotely (some requiring more hours than before) and there's no money to pay anyone.

You cancel all classes and return all tuition money:

1. Many schools have to lay off all adjuncts (already underpaid), faculty and support staff leading to higher unemployment rates and possibly making it so schools can't reopen in 6 months or a year (or whenever this is over).
2. Students who were only a few weeks out from graduating can't finish out their classes and don't graduate/have to take classes again (and maybe incur more costs because it's postponing how long they aren't working full time).
3. Some schools go under - students will not be able to finish out at that university at all because it will no longer exist.
4. Support services offered by colleges are no longer available and students are on their own.

I can somewhat understand this argument somewhere like Harvard, but MOST schools aren't Harvard and most don't have the kind of money you are talking about.

I teach at a community college. If a student is lower income, there should be no reason they can't get through all their tuition on Pell Grants (it costs 6k to get your entire degree). We're, as an institution, moving towards OER textbooks to help students with cost even more. Most faculty even donate money monthly towards a fund that helps students with non-academic life costs in emergencies as well.

We are offering tuition reimbursement through next week for any student that wants to drop and retake the class. But the thing is - most students don't want to do that. They want to finish out the semester. Are the classes as effective as they were a month ago? No, of course not. But neither is work being done in workplaces right now... because everyone is living through a really traumatic, hopefully once-in-a-lifetime event. Most of us are just doing the best we can right now.

Reimbursement on housing and food makes more sense as an argument to me. And I think students should have the OPTION to drop and get tuition reimbursed for the semester - particularly students who aren't in position to be continuing their education online. However, the idea that universities and colleges should just completely shut down and that there wouldn't be long term consequences to that is absurd.

I also completely agree that it costs way too much to get an education in this country. But there's multiple issues that have caused that and a big portion of that is government support.  Public universities and community colleges used to have significantly more of their costs covered by the state. When this was chipped away at over the course of 30 years, more and more of that cost fell to the students. And yes, many universities also have problems with spending and administrative bloat - but that isn't the ONLY cause or problem. Community colleges (mostly) have none of those issues and we still have less funding per student than we used to have. No one here is making money off of this at that level and still more cost falls to the student when funding is cut.

But at the end of the day, the cost portion is a discussion for when this is all over. We're in a crisis and most universities and colleges are doing everything they can to support their students right now. I'm working 7 days a week to recreate all my classes, simplify assignments so that students aren't overloaded with switching mid-semester while not losing the essentials they need to come out of the classes with, and accommodating pretty much every single request students are making because they are all dealing with their own difficulties right now. My college has been contacting students individually to make sure they have technology and internet (and if not, try to get them those things). They've been trying to make sure they can get in touch with health services and unemployment and that they know where food pantries are. Basically we are running as a social support for many of our students right now, because ensuring they eat and have somewhere to live is more important than if their education is exactly up to par this semester. If we shut down, students wouldn't have this extra level of support they are able to get through the college. We're the 3rd hardest hit area in the country and trying to do everything we can for our student population right now.

Writeresearch,fm9kuve,t1_fm8lr0s,1585870805.0,"Two questions that may change the answers you get to those questions though:

1. How old are they at the time of the story?
2. How many years apart?

My sister and I (3 years apart, I'm female) are super close, but that wasn't the case until we were in our early teens and in my experience that was younger than all of my friends started getting along with their siblings. We did primarily because my parents were really into camping and LONG road trips. So when we were kids we'd just make friends with other kids in the campground (because it was SO uncool to hang out with my baby sister), but then as a teenager it's awkward to make new friends when travelling so it was either hang out with her or be alone. 

I remember distinctly the first time I hunt out with her - I wanted to go to the beach, we were camping somewhere in South Carolina near the ocean. I lectured her for at least 10 minutes about how she needed to act cool and not embarrass me (I was 13, she was 10). She worked so hard at being cool, haha. But we actually had fun and within a year she was my best friend and I never cared about her being my little/baby sister again. I would invite her to hang out with my friends in high school all the time and was basically an adopted little sister for my whole friend group. Most of my friends, though, really didn't become close with their siblings until late high school or when they were all adults (if ever). 

To your parent question - in our case no. My dad and her don't get along at all (and are currently not speaking to each other). I will listen to them about it but not take sides and they both respect that (her more so than my dad, but my stepmom keeps him in line). If she pushed me though on it, I think it would hurt our relationship. I can accept she has reasons to be upset with my dad but that doesn't change that I still want a relationship with him. She respects that, so it hasn't changed anything in our relationship. The only thing I put my foot down with both of them was that this was not going to affect my daughter (e.g. if she had a birthday party I expected them to both show up and act like adults). 

I'm definitely closer to her than anyone else in my family. My immediate family (parents and their parents) is a bit dysfunctional, so she is the only one that really really gets my issues and vice versa. We can always call each other when we're pissed at our parents or need to vent about family stuff and know the other one understands in a way that outsiders can't. Also we share so many formative experiences that it makes us close in a way that I am not with anyone else - and I am someone who has some really really close friends as well. 

I think really close siblings have a way of calling each other out on their bullshit that's specific to siblings, so if you are trying to show that closeness, that might be a way to go about it. Like even for small things - a close sibling is going to know what you are going to do or say before you do it (and if you are lying to yourself about something they'll know). For an example, when I decided I wanted to teach college English (focusing on literature), my sister was like ""basically you are going into this so you can force people to read all the books you like and talk to you about them, right?"" Because for YEARS I kept trying to get her to read all my favorite books. And I'd never thought about it that way, but laughed so hard when she said it because it was dead-on one of the things that was appealing about it. So it's those kinds of little things, I think."

But I do know that is also the time frame where humanities and the arts were devalued. This is the same time frame where it was decided that business classes were more useful than art history, and there was a general move towards practical over classical education. I really struggle with the simple-minded argument here given that there are a lot of moving pieces.

I teach English and my students have to take Composition I (which is primarily spent getting students prepared to write essays in college - something many of them are underprepared for). But they no longer have to take a literature class, because taking Spanish II (a language class that while important isn't teaching any level of analysis and criticism) qualifies as the same gen ed category. You know what literature teaches? Textual analysis, critical thinking, and all the other things that study is pointing out is missing. Lit departments have been shrinking for over a decade as their classes are no longer taken at the same time that people are crying out wondering why their students and graduates don't have critical thinking skills.

There are other classes that teach similar skills, but they have been systematically removed from general education requirements over the years and the entire fields devalued by the whole of society (and politicians). So blaming universities for being liberal as the only reason why students aren't getting educated seems absolutely absurd.

**Edit**: It was nagging at me how biased this article sounded. Even in higher education articles that are opinion-based, there tends to be a lot of ""complicating"" of ideas - the idea that nothing is black and white/simple and that many things converge together to create situations. So, it seemed odd to me to offer such a simplistic one-sided argument. Looking into this, I now see that this is published by the Manhattan Institute. So, I think it's safe to say this is an *incredibly* biased resource and should be treated as such.
