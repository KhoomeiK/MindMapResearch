Advice,fajl68x,t1_fajk79x,1576143440.0,"It's okay to voice your opinion and be honest about it but do not try to talk her into anything. I've never been in your situation so it's really hard to give tips but try to go through it together and support each other. The thing is that freaking out will not do anything. You're in this situation now and you will solve it one way or the other. If you keep the child it will be hard but it won't be the end of the world. Others have done it, you can do it too. That doesn't mean that your life is over or that you will have to stay together forever or anything like that. It will be hard but it is doable. If you do not keep the child you will also have to live with this decision and it will be hard too. Most important is that you are not alone in this and that you're a support system for each other. Meet your girlfriend, hug her, freak out together until you both are calmer and then talk all your options through.


edit: you do have to talk to some adult though because she needs to see a doctor and if she decides to abort then she will probably need consent of her parents too"
