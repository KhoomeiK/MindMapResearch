AskFeminists,fqca8vn,t3_ghm3sr,1589253449.0,"I have experienced this as a coloured woman working as a nurse. I found it worse for myself when one of my colleagues was the bosses friend. As I am introverted all I could do was document what I could. Oh and I got the worst shifts so I was always more tired than others. So it was assumed that I didn’t care when I was just overworked. At least you have the support of your manager who believes you, keep that person informed. Also some people will use every meal break to come up with their next plan on what to say or to manipulate things to suit them. It is usually the worst with people whom have worked somewhere for a long time, they have the system all worked out to their advantage."

The grandfathers in the family always had very strong and tough hands from their work. The women wore gloves when they could during house work and kept a diet. I do remember stories of how hard my Grandmas worked from home, Great Grandma scrubbing the floor on her hands and knees. Going back further on the other side of my family Grandma had to plant her food. Now my husband works in IT and has delicate hands he hates exercise. I go running and do the mowing. Nutrition is so important I won’t pressure my daughter about her weight like I was when I was younger."
