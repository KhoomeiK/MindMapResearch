BipolarReddit,fmu9ehl,t1_fmu1ka6,1586387010.0,"Oh, I agree with you. If you read OP’s description of what makes her “bipolar” too, you see it’s a lot of traits that are more representative of borderline (traumatic childhood, self harm) than bipolar. That’s not to say there isn’t a relationship between these things and bipolar disorder, but it’s definitely more prevalent with borderline."

There’s such thing as ultradian cycling, but it’s extremely rare— a lot of people on this subreddit describe themselves as having it, but that’s extremely suspect."
BipolarReddit,fkohf3d,t1_fko49od,1584387276.0,"\> That stability is hard-won and too precious to risk on drinking, drugs, or ""being spontaneous."" 

I want to emphasize the last part. My friends get mad at me for not doing anything spontaneous and being boring. Truth is, I'm so focused on staying stable that I don't want to risk anything."
BipolarReddit,fj1wx3n,t1_fj19j2t,1582929637.0,"I had this experience when I was traveling for work to Virginia (from Florida). I had forgotten my Geodon back at home, and I went to a local CVS to see if they could provide me with enough to cover me until I got home. I was told that the pharmacist wasn't comfortable doing it because it was medication for a psychiatric condition (her words). She told me to go the ER if I needed it (and offered to print out a list of all the medications I was on to give them). Another CVS in the area filled it no problem. So when you are traveling, do your due diligence and make sure the pharmacy you are going to has a sympathetic pharmacist. It's at their discretion to provide emergency refills."
