JUST AN FYI.. THIS IS FROM AN RN WORKING IN AN ICU HERE IN ONE OF OUR TULSA HOSPITALS

In light of being criticized or mocked,... please take my heed seriously precious community.
We are fighting a losing battle now. I know many of you have heard on the news how seriously low on equipment, machinery, masks, and all basic proper protective equipment our nation is, but I need to tell you exactly how low. We are three days of being completely exhausted of supplies at South Hillcrest, Hillcrest Main has the same story,.... I’ve been told Saint Francis and John’s are all in the same situation, or worse... many outlying facilities have been robbed, or have exhausted their supplies, especially Oklahoma County, as they have 20 known positives in their area.
I just completed a 13 hour shift using the same masks, (doubled), glasses are sanitized and reused, and we are reusing protective gowns. We managed to find foot protective gear for our shoes, but those can’t be reused... as they rip and tear so easily. We are almost out of hair nets as well. To guard against this disease it calls for an N95 mask. This is airborne when we are venting patients, preforming bronchoscopies, and during initial intubation. Once this mask is soiled, it’s rendered ineffective. We’ve had several nurses and respiratory therapists exposed about a week ago to patient zero,... and tests weren’t offered to them right away. Many of us will likely infect our families. We are ill equipped and outmanned. 
I have some requests...
If you know of anyone with extra supplies and can offer it,... we’d be grateful. Painters, construction workers, airport personnel, dentist offices, etc.
Second request, please for the love of God, stay home. Only go out when necessary. I can’t stress this enough. 
I’ve been in healthcare for 15 years. We made it through H1N1, Ebola, and annual Flus.... Collectively, we’ve never fought a battle to this degree.... 
we need the communities, state’s, and nation’s support.

Our last patient last night took the last available ventilator in the state of Oklahoma and Texas, according to our unit physician pulmonologist. 
We are discussing who lives and who dies now.... we are making these decisions for you,... because we can’t keep you alive. Your lungs are filling up, your hearts are giving out, your organs are becoming septic.... 
I work in the Intensive Care Unit. I was trained for this. Not a lot scares us. This is frustrating because we can’t save everyone..., if you love your family...., stay home, because we might not have a ventilator to save them eventually if it comes to it. We are crossing over into field medicine. This is war. Please help us help you. 
I pray the nation puts us all on lock down soon. We have 13 Rule out positives in this facility. The same story is at many others,... so expect the numbers to continue to climb.... please stay home. Not all tests are being added correctly, either... I suspect we have around 500 positives in Oklahoma as of today."

politics,fl4y77s,t1_fl4dndj,1584824227.0,I don’t know why people can’t see this. We are controlled by healthcare. Our jobs and lives depend on it. Insurance with a job is still a major expense then we are afraid to use it because of the cost. The freedom it would give working class Americans if healthcare could not be held over their heads by corporate America. Medicare for all would be a life changer for working Americans and they aren’t going to let it happen.

Their is a very large evangelical movement that uses their power and money to influence government. I see this as a threat to my freedom of religion. Sorry you get caught up in that."

A lot of people did not think they should have collapsed the way they did, but engineers who studied it had good explanations why they did. What I’m pretty sure of is that if this was a terrorist act they could not have known they would fall, this was probably just luck on their part. Please don’t take that the wrong way."

So let me get this right, there is a book that is supposedly dictated by god, but you can modernize it without his assistance? But don’t modernize it too much or people might be allowed to do things they aren’t supposed to."
AskReddit,fl4fpc3,t1_fl3ksoc,1584812556.0,I am a pretty smart person but I have these kind of moments. I live in Oklahoma where “coon hunting” is really popular and everyone has read Where the Red Fern Grows. I was an adult when I heard someone talking about the raccoon they had treed the night before and I can remember looking at him dumbfounded and saying wait you mean coons are raccoons? When they figured out I was serious they were hysterical.
politics,fl48fh9,t1_fl458d0,1584808183.0,"You are right, this is what the majority of Democrats want and you can blame the media and everything else but a good majority of Democrats are just a little left of Republicans. And they are showing up at the polls.

But that doesn’t mean I can’t be sad about it. I thought just maybe we were finally ready for some real change but it’s not going to happen. I am a democrat and will always vote but my vote for Hillary felt way better than my vote for Biden is going to feel and look where that got us."

democrats,fl3xmi3,t1_fl3pd99,1584801026.0,"I’m this way with both my parents, but my mother is the hardest for me. She was a life long democrat, supported Hillary in 08 but when Obama got the nomination it was like she had never been a democrat in her life. And if I even try to suggest maybe him being black had anything to do with it, she has a meltdown. Because we both know the truth.

She has a lot of health problems so I called her yesterday to check on her, and her theory about this virus ranged from hoax to the most unbelievable it was started by Obama with the help of the Chinese because she knows how much Michelle Obama hated America she said it all the time and if she does so does her husband. How do you get to that level of insanity?"
politics,fl3t7vf,t1_fl3p4l9,1584797556.0,I noticed that Ohio is taking a different route than a lot of places. I’m here in Oklahoma where our headline is Governor will not be ordering the closing of any businesses because it’s not the government’s place to tell businesses what to do. Apparently businesses are only people when they want to donate money to politicians.
