Vent,fqlskf5,t3_gjmxk9,1589465269.0,"If your friend feels the need to always try to out-due you for her own validation, she shouldn’t be your friend. Friendly competition is always good amongst friends. Or even trying to want your friends to excel at what they do. But if she is constantly trying to put you down always, then that’s not someone you should be around. Even if it’s not purposeful or conscious, you still shouldn’t be treated like that. If you feel like she is a valuable enough friend, you should maybe express how you feel. But if you think that this mixed with other qualities she has, are not beneficial and supportive to you; distance yourself. Everyone excels at what they do at different speeds. Just because you feel you are not as good, it doesn’t make you a bad artist. And also it’s conditioning you to believe that your art is bad. It will eventually burn you out. Just weigh out your options. But always respect yourself to know when to leave someone."
StarKid,fqjqppb,t3_fert7b,1589413816.0,"I didn’t really like it. But if you guys say it gets better after a second watch, I’ll have to give it a shot. I just didn’t really connect with the characters. I had trouble keeping track who was who. Of course Lauren Lopez did an incredible job as always. The romance wasn’t very convincing to me. Maybe I am being too critical. Obviously it’s Starkid and they always have some sense of goofy in their musicals. But this one felt very different. I just didn’t really enjoy the main plot that much. I didn’t think I was going to enjoy TGWDLM that much and I LOVED it. So I was expecting Black Friday to be very good. Maybe I’m being biased, because seeing the og starkid cast is very nostalgic. And this one felt foreign. But after another watch, I’ll be less critical."

Being stuck at home with your controlling parents is never fun. And it doesn’t make sense if you are legally allowed to make a choice of which parent you want to stay with, and she feels the need to take your iPad. My parents used to do that then stopped. Doing that makes children very secretive and afraid. As with the weight comments... that’s horrible. I mean my mom is very similar, very VERY controlling. When I had an ED, she told me she “cared” about me recovering. She used to weigh me and watch me eat. And I am recovered and to this day. Buy she has this sick pleasure in weighing less than me. Making comments like “I didn’t know where all that weight went... oh my god! I’m 100 pounds”. And she KNOWS I hate that. Especially since I am recovered, and I don’t understand her motive. Or buying clothes too small for me just to show me how “skinny” I’ve gotten. And when I don’t fit into them, I am happy just to make her mad that she can’t say that I look “emaciated”. I’m truly sorry your family is like this. And that she seems to not pay any regard for your feelings. Something as stupid as controlling who you talk to just for sake of being controlling is stupid. Parents who have children let’s say that’s “made a mistake” that lost their parent’s trust I would understand. But just to do it, just to feel power over your child is disgusting. Hopefully people won’t be stupid and quarantine will end soon. And you will feel a little more free from her grasp."

You are important, it’s truly disheartening you don’t see that.  People always tell me “it’s ok, it’s ok” when you know it isn’t. The worst shock of my life was when a petite woman with a clipboard came into the private waiting room and told me that my father had passed away. It... the pain was indescribable. Just the very thought of it made my body hollow, empty. I remember texting my friends and calling them.... and they ask “is he ok”. I’d mcFRICKIN lose it man... because... I had to say “no”. Things don’t always have to be ok. And quite frankly my life still sucks balls. But... you can choose which parts to focus on. The jubilation, or the sorrow. I have depression which makes it IMPOSSIBLE to find the good in things. And all those times I swore I wouldn’t live past 18.... and I’m still here. You are worthy. I’m sorry you feel so lonely. People do care, and even if they don’t... find those who will. Everyone has value, no matter what traits they hold. Being honest, life doesn’t get better, it’s this series of tormenting waves. And you just gotta make sure when you ride those ups, that when you crash on down, you’re able to get back on that “board”, and keep your head high. Always, always, find something to fight for. You are important, you are worthy. It’s a shame we live in such a selfish world with superficial interactions and relationships. But kind and caring people do exist out there.

When parents make the decision to have a child (if they want that child or not) it is it their responsibility to nurture that child. You can’t chose to be born. None of us chose to be here. And I can understand why she would be constantly stressed. I am sorry you feel that way. About the fact she sometimes contributes to your anxiety and depression. It seems more so that your mother has very bad problems with stress management and controlling her anger. And it clearly gets to you. Maybe if this truly is an issue, bring it up with her. Talk about how it makes you feel. 
Even if the things she does (work, taking care of her kids... or whatever) is stressful, she shouldn’t take it out on you. If this is something that truly affects you and happens often, maybe bringing light to the issue might help. And always have a backup plan. Work on your own stress and anxiety management. Learn to calm yourself down from bad situations, so you won’t be as easily negatively affected by your mother. Sorry this is probably running in circles, but I hope this helps. Also, I completely missed the point let me know!"
