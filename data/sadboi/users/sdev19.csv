Edit: I change my mind. Y’all are right! LOL"

AskWomen,fqhtdfb,t3_gil16z,1589384211.0,"I had a job as a trainer at a call centre. Absolutely loved it. The management was brutal, LOTS of talking behind backs, and strewn micro managing and general shadiness. The manger was actually a family friend but had no idea how to manage people, I don’t want to go into too many specifics but I ended up leaving because my mental health was starting to be effected and two others ended up leaving not long after me. Finally, they realized it was because of the manager and fired her about two months after I left. I wish I could have stuck it out and just waited for the inevitable to happen instead of leaving. But now I’m at an amazing company and the morale and management is so much better."

BravoRealHousewives,fqe53on,t3_ghzl5i,1589301895.0,What was the issue with Scott in the beginning? I can’t remember why they didn’t work out before and what’s the reason for all their back and fourth?
politics,fqbonq4,t3_ghx0k5,1589240958.0,..How? How do they allow this shit to happen?
summerhousebravo,fpuacav,t1_fpu7y8e,1588908171.0,I agree. I never thought of it that way. If the shit I did in my twenties was on tv I’d die of embarrassment lo
summerhousebravo,fpua451,t1_fps6a1m,1588908021.0,"Ya know, now that I’m 30 I can actually say the same. I feel for her now. Not a fun place to be in."
BravoRealHousewives,fprye8h,t1_fpq3x8t,1588864362.0,I think she’s jealous that he would actually be a good boyfriend if him and Hannah do actually date. She’s sees potential in him that she knows Kyle is lacking.
summerhousebravo,fprvteh,t1_fprtkcr,1588863004.0,SO immature. I think she’s so jealous of everyone around her. It’s really showing this season.

realhousewives,foby6q6,t3_g6p8i6,1587664997.0,"I love how much Erika has opened up and I am here for it! She seems like the only level headed one of the bunch these days. 

Rinna’s attitude bugs me. When she was in the car with Teddi talking about causing scenes at events when you’re supposed to be there to support really rubbed me the wrong way."

Anxiety,fmfeq29,t3_fo6h6w,1586025698.0,"Thank. You. For. This. 

I’ve been having tightness in my chest for two days and feeling breathless. Just had an anxiety attack in front of my husband half hour ago because I keep thinking I have it. So thankful I came here, definitely puts me at ease."
DoesAnybodyElse,fm4rbgy,t3_fssyg8,1585759370.0,"I love it and mostly love the praise my hubby gives me after each meal. (Pinterest is our best friend). I’ve even got him looking for new recipes on it as well. 

Try to get all the ingredients measured and ready before you start, then when you do it’s so much easier to just add everything in! And clean the items as you go, helps with the cleanup at the end. 

The best feeling you’ll have is when you take that first bite and you’re like “Damnnnn I did good”.

I try to do this about three times a week and make enough for lunches and leftovers so you’re not doing it EVERY night."
DoesAnybodyElse,flu4nq9,t3_fqugfi,1585495128.0,"Absolutely! I even catch myself watching tv shows and being like “omg that person is way too close to that person” or “wow, how are they all at a conference together?” Oh right, it’s tv and not real life haha."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,flkyc7a,t3_fpc4vb,1585249985.0,"My phone does this too but with texting. Once, I went to text my husband and his name was changed to an ex’s name in my phone (who I hadn’t spoken to in years). It was the oddest thing. Turned off my phone and back on and it was back to his name. 

Then the other day I added a new contact in my phone and about an hour later I went to text a colleague back (we had a chat already going) and her name was changed to the new contact I had just added. But when I search in my contact list her name is there as it should be. 

Very strange and annoying to say the least. 

I have an iPhone XR."

movies,flas7ke,t3_fnplw1,1584990067.0,"My husband and RARELY watch anything under a 7/10 on IMDB. We’ve found anything under that rating has been a disappointment to us so we try to stay above. (No offence to any shows or movies of course).

I also like seeing that people have to say about a movie or show. We watch a lot so it helps weed out the not so good ones."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fl6vxqh,t1_fl5psi2,1584885051.0,"Yes she did, she said she heard fireman playing about a minute before the song actually played. And after R also confirmed after that he also heard it.

I’m not sure if this qualifies as a glitch but hubby and I were just so confused when it happened so thought I’d put in here.

Edit: I meant K confirmed, not R."
unpopularopinion,fl58mf7,t3_fmcl5r,1584830991.0,"Totally agree, I deleted my Instagram app 5 weeks ago and am loving it. I use to do it for a week here and there, then the last time I just never got it back. Gives me anxiety when I think about downloading it again. 

Feels so good to not care or know what anyone is doing."

One of my friends dads recently passed away and he got a text from his number this morning.

So weird, freaked everyone out but glad I found this!"
