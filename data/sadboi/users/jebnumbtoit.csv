A top-down bottom-up shade like a Honeycomb or Roman Shade (look up hunter Douglas Duette and Vignette styles) which you could mount directly on window frame or inside the framing if there‚Äôs enough depth (though that would be problematic when opening window). Excellent shade style as you have privacy at bottom but some light in at the top.

It looks like you‚Äôll be entering the room from the opposing side more often so I change my mind, longer side of sofa should be near the dining table (acting as a divider). This will also give more space for your drapery.


Previous response:
100% window side, that way the room is more open when walking in and you can change up your room divider should you find a better option later on. 

As for room divider, I suppose you could add a unit like you have in the photos, or you could maybe install a track divider system with a sliding door."
