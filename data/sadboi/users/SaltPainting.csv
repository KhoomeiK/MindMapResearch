BingeEatingDisorder,fr18jgm,t3_gm2pbu,1589815262.0,"Don’t have much help except me too. I’m trying to regulate my meals and have three balanced meals a day with vegetables and a snack. I’m still binging but there’s a silver lining—when I focus on getting satisfying, sit-down meals in, i binge less. It fucking sucks because I’m still binging and I feel like trash but I’m way better than when I’d just say “fuck it” and binge, or go for a day without eating or eating one rice cake and then binge. Idk. This is a ramble.

TL;DR—found I’m still fucking binging but it’s at LEAST less binging and snacking when I focus on three healthy meals a day. I hate this and I hate obsessing over it and I’m with you hon, it’s the absolute worst."
