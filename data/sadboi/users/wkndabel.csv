AskReddit,fkgxe7l,t3_fi9tbz,1584179045.0,"Our Headteacher was a bit of a fruit loop - she was always implementing new, stupid rules that no one agreed with. She used to take people's coats and scarves off people during winter, and never give them back. She had a huge pile in her office of students outdoor coats and kept them. Then one day - not too long before she just disappeared and never came back - she made a new rule that all female students were to only wear white bras. It was a secondary school in the UK, so our uniform included a white formal shirt. She would have the teachers check girls blouses during class (basically staring at their breasts). Some teachers didn't do it, but it got to a point where a few male teachers took advantage and made a point of staring at girls breasts when they entered the room.
Weird rule, weird teachers

EDIT: Also, one of the religious studies teachers also had a photo of his naked wife in a bathtub as his screensaver on his laptop, and would show you. He also brought a butchers knife to school that he kept in his drawer, and when a few students confronted him about it he said it was to ""cut an apple"" with. Those students ended up getting excluded for telling other teachers he was carrying a knife. Now he's a Trucker & a member of Grindr (the seedy gay dating website) and offers to sleep with guys during his business trips. He's still married too.
