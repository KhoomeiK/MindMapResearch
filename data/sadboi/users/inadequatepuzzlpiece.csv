depression,f0625nn,t3_d3soyg,1568426734.0,I couldn't imagine it either. I was miserable in highschool and knew a job would make me even more so. After working different jobs for 4 years now I can say that I have hated every job I've ever worked. I just wish I were a ghost so I wouldn't have to deal with this. Life is nothing but suffering.
depression,ezwyq46,t3_d2ul40,1568228129.0,I think depression makes us envious and sometimes spiteful. I see post on here about friends when I have never had one. I see people complaining about there so's when I am forever alone. I see people who have talent waste their lives while I wish I was good at one thing. I see people who make tons of money while I will probably always live as an impoverished minority. Or those who complain about how their intelligence makes them miserable when I am a dumb fuck who is miserable and no one cares. All of these things get to me. It makes it hard to sympathize with those who have so much more than me. I try because no one deserves to suffer from this every day.

depression,eyy6ett,t3_czg0i7,1567573020.0,After almost a decade of depression I can say that things don't magically get better. Your brain just gets used to you being depressed. I think that being depressed becomes your default state of mind and it becomes harder and harder change it. If you are truly depressed no amount of positive thinking will fix it. Things will just steadily get worse.

depression,eyspl22,t3_cyisil,1567407405.0,I don't like how society treats those that are deemed different. I was bullied growing up and am still getting made fun of even today.

depression,eysp8ka,t3_cyisil,1567406956.0,I just hate how difficult and expensive it is to get a correct diagnosis and adequate treatment.  It is sad when seeking professional help is a last resort because it is so expensive or people feel it is useless because it won't work.

People won't care. Damn even my co workers won't give a shit lol. They will probably laugh that the tard offed himself.
SuicideWatch,eyrwi08,t3_cyeix0,1567380289.0,Sometimes you need to feel pain to understand what someone else is going through. No excuse for their lack of empathy though.

depression,ey7bgi9,t3_cvyozt,1566877345.0,Their help sucks but that is just from my experience.  They ask you some questions and give you b.s. feel good advice. They are good with simple things like directing you towards free/cheap help in your area. If you stick to school related questions they may be helpful but if you are looking for an actual therapist you are gonna have a bad day. It can't hurt to try since it's free I guess.
depression,ey7bcvz,t3_cvysz3,1566877255.0,Nostalgia can make me happy for one moment and miserable the next. I have had times where I would lay on my bed and cry wishing things could be like they used to many years ago. Fortunately it hasn't made me feel suicide just miserable.

I mainly posted to relate to you and maybe offer a tiny bit of relief.
depression,exdhrxc,t1_exdhboz,1566177016.0,It is a long story. To answer shortly yes I have. Medication works somewhat but it is only temporary.

depression,exdfvga,t3_cs9cgf,1566175547.0,The rational thing for me to do is kill myself. My existence is worthless. I just don't want to die that badly yet.

I have a mental health clinic that offers free services to eligible patients. Maybe you have a similar program in your area? I get free medication. It gives relief but honestly the side effects are what made me stop taking it. Just wanted to let you know.
SuicideWatch,ex55kv8,t1_ex4zblc,1566017089.0,Yeah the paranoia is definitely the worst part. I can take the depression but like you said paranoia is hell.
