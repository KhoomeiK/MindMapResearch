CESB,fqzttep,t1_fqzk6cq,1589775229.0,Okay awesome thank you very much for your help!!
CESB,fqyvchd,t1_fqxsay0,1589755188.0,"Right exactly that’s what I told them and saw too on the website and on the bill to Curious, do you primary ties to Canada still? Are you considered a non-resident for tax purposes?

In this [link](https://www.hrblock.ca/earned-small-amount-income-heres-still-file-return/) it says that income of up to $11,474 is non taxable. Is that true? Because I don’t earn any income in either USA or Canada and the max I would get form CESB would be $5,000. So I don’t know if I would have to pay taxes on it.

I was also curious if it was difficult registering your SIN with CRA with a USA address. I’m planning to call them Tuesday and was wondering if it would be an issue.

I do think looking at it as a loan is good but if they don’t mention residency, I wouldn’t worry too much. As long as we meet the requirements, which we do, there’s a good reason we won’t be asked to pay it back."
CESB,fqxizof,t1_fqwnucm,1589733036.0,"So I’m assuming you qualified right, because a lot of people I asked about CESB were saying you need to have residency and stuff. Right exactly that’s my fear too, having to give it back when you’ve already spent it. Also you have to pay taxes on it, even though you don’t make any money and don’t exceed $10,000 in income?"
PersonalFinanceCanada,fqveuz3,t1_fqvdruf,1589675785.0,"I’m definitely falsely claiming CESB when I meet all the requirements for eligibility by the government, makes perfect sense. I may be a resident of another country but still a citizen of Canada. Many international Canadian students don’t receive coronavirus stimulus from the country they are studying in, so their home country give them that relief. Please use your brain. 

Still don’t understand why you think i’m in ineligible when it shows I am, they include abroad students whom are citizens. The law, bill and website says so. 

There are not penalties or interests when paying back CESB or CERB, it’s also in the law. Seems like for someone who likes to refer to the law so much, you can’t read it very well. Seems like the amazing education system my country has in place isn’t as effective as it claims to be."
PersonalFinanceCanada,fqvctwh,t1_fqv9xyp,1589674568.0,"Just found the [CESB BILL ](https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-1/bill/C-15/third-reading)NOT THE CERB BILL which you have posted. They are two different bills. In the bill it doesn’t mention residency anywhere. Please stop spreading false information to students. This is the correct bill for CESB, the bill for students. I asked as a student and you told me information as an employee, referring me to the CERB. They are not one bill but two different bills. CERB is C-13 and CERB is C-15.

u/bpond7 refer to this comment because you are also incorrect. You are also spreading false information and outright telling people they do not qualify even after referring to the GOVERNMENT WEBSITE. Hard to see why the government would be the wrong. Since you kept talking about the “law” check out the law and see how you’re an idiot and ignorant for saying I’m abusing the system."
PersonalFinanceCanada,fqvbudy,t1_fqv9xyp,1589673973.0,I see the Student Loan and the Student Financial Act but nothing on the $1225 payment.
PersonalFinanceCanada,fqv98oe,t1_fqv8ntf,1589672437.0,"Nothing on CESB only CERB which is different and has different “laws” and eligibility requirements. Either way you didnt answer why the website with eligibilities, which I meet, would be different from the law."
PersonalFinanceCanada,fqv7zvl,t1_fqv5a52,1589671726.0,"Which has the eligibility requirements. You guys keep saying the “law” is different from the website. Why would the website be different from the stimulus bill? 

Do you have the link for the law?"
PersonalFinanceCanada,fquxyzd,t1_fquwg3y,1589666241.0,"The first eligibility requirement is not residency nor is it a requirement at all. [Here are the requirements for CESB](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/emergency-student-benefit/cesb-who-apply.html). You are thinking of residency for CERB and EI benefits. 

I do qualify for CESB according to the Canadian Government so I am not fraudulently taking shit. Myself and my family are all Canadian Citizens and have lived there for a large part of out lives. I applied for a second SIN ACCIDENTALLY. If you could read you would know that. I already have one and have had one for a long time but never had to use it because my family doesn’t leech off the government for benefits and SI like many others do.

Clearly you don’t know how to read or are too ignorant to. So please fucking pay attention next time you want to call someone out asshole."
CESB,fqu9eud,t1_fqr1t5r,1589654587.0,I am kinda in the situation as I’m a Canadian Citizen but studying in the US and was told I would a non resident for tax purposes. Curious if anyone figured it you.

PersonalFinanceCanada,fqu2p0l,t1_fqu1jup,1589650865.0,"I may be a dependent but we don’t qualify for US benefits. US doesn’t even give full benefits to permanent residents so why would visa residents get anything. They don’t because we have already checked. 

I’ll report but you don’t have to pay taxes on income up to $10,000. Maximum CESB gives you $8,000 so I wouldn’t need to pay taxes. 

I would love to read the law of the CESB legislation but I cannot seem to find it. But either way shouldn’t the website be a reflection of the law, showing the eligibility, process and benefits. I don’t mind finding the nitty gritty details but if the website says I qualify I’m pretty confident I do. Many others who apply for EI and CERB refer to the website for eligibility and receive compensation without needing to further looking into the law. If it’s on there and it checks off I’m positive I qualify."
PersonalFinanceCanada,fqu16o8,t1_fqu0e9l,1589650024.0,"In the eligibility for the CESB it doesn’t mention residency. I am still a student in the US and for CESB that’s all they require. I’m not trying to take advantage of the system, I haven’t received any stimulus check from the US or any funds from my school. I’m left eating through my savings for a situation no one predicted. 

I am definitely entitled for those funds as my father has paid taxes every year before moving and as a Canadian citizen. That income is taxable but its less than $13,000 that I have received so I don’t have to pay taxes on it in either Canada or US."
CESB,fqu0dtr,t3_gbjezc,1589649581.0,Can I register my SIN with the CRA even though I live in the US? Because I read somewhere you need to give your address but I don’t reside in Canada as I’m studying in the US.

I am a Biomedical Student who can’t work in a hospital or labs because of the situation. That qualifies as eligibility.

I am a Canadian-born Citizen and not a US resident. I do not have a green card from the US. I may not have a F-1 or J-1 visa but I am still considered as a student from Canada and not classified as a US resident by the school and US government. The eligibility for the CESB allows studying abroad Canadians."
PersonalFinanceCanada,fqtyes4,t1_fqty1ne,1589648502.0,Oh damn. Was hoping I qualify for CESB because we don’t get any money from the US. In the qualification for CESB it says I am eligible to receive benefits though.
