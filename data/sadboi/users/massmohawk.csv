This is what happened in Washington state and they currently have the most deaths in the states. I'm a 30-something year old and I don't care if I get it. But, there are plenty of people I know or work with that could be hospitalized or die. That is a huge deal. There are health care workers who need to know where it is spreading so they can prepare. What if a healthcare worker gets infected, doesn't know, and infects immune vulnerable patients in turn? What if they die?

The administration has no good reason not to test, not to immobilize, not to be transparent. They don't send enough tests, they don't widen the criteria to be tested, and they don't warn the public because artificially lowering the numbers is good politics for them.

Without data, we can't contain the virus. Imagine all the unknown Americans who currently have it, traveling all over the world and spreading it to other countries. It's going to be incredibly damaging to the USA when we start reinfecting the world."

Also your opinion is based on personal experience and zero science. We have no health history on you or your family. These things could have significantly explained your hard drug use. I say this with no judgment as someone who smokes and has done hard drugs. My own reasons for doing hard drugs are based on both choice and history. I'm honestly curious if the whole 'gateway' drug theory was founded in DARE, which was notoriously unsuccessful and not based on science.  

Edit: would also add that weed CAN be a gateway drug if the people who sell you weed are also into/pushing other things. This is how in my 30s I discovered other things. But it was absolutely not because of weed. Hence why I smoked weed in my 20s without ever doing anything else until I moved to a state where weed wasn't legal. I had to find a dealer and things went south."

I think I told myself that the hangovers were worse with wine or liquor and that by drinking beer I wouldn't get drunk as fast or feel worse the day after. I was never much of a binge drinker but an everyday drinker.

I personally never connected with AA, but that's just me. Why you are doing this is personal to you, but for me it was masking my depression and anxiety, boredom, and unhappiness with my life and my choices - which alcohol certainly doesn't improve. It was easier for me to ignore things when I drank, easier for me to fall asleep, easier to forget the past. I thought alcohol made things easier but once I accepted that it actually just made everything harder (including finances) I told myself I had to stop or I was going to slowly poison myself slowly to death. I think sometimes that I wanted to die, but slowly. I'm trying to embrace life and be happy, be happy sober. It's taking some adjustment but I'm focusing on spending time with my pup, working out, and drinking water or tea or seltzer whenever I get a craving.

Good luck to you! IWNDWYT!

AmItheAsshole,ezxa7is,t3_d2uish,1568235563.0,NTA because this was 18 years ago. If this was a more recent death I could maybe understand the wife getting upset... but come on. OP wasn't even the same person they were 18 years ago. Maybe the hand holding/hugging picture wasn't the best choice but for OPs wife to call and ask if OP wants a divorce is so over the top IMO. I'd be willing to go NAH wife's reaction was too much for someone who has been deceased for 18 years.

I used to use it for big purchases like a TV and a bike. Also I can my company's non-profit ID designation if I'm eating out on company money and I don't have to pay taxes. I've lived abroad and this system is so ridiculously complicated."
