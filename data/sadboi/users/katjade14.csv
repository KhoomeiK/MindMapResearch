rape,fr2z20s,t3_gmbpxw,1589846666.0,omg i got a message like this from the same person months ago too! i fought back and they just kept saying more and it hurt so badly but then i realized they’re just really fucked up and what they’re saying isn’t true. they’re not worth anyone’s time and nobody can prove them wrong. i find r/rapecounseling better just because there’s less of those shitty people

AskReddit,fqw4su0,t3_gl8h8e,1589692858.0,"only a few people know but i don’t mind saying here, but i got addicted to drugs and sold my body at the age of 14. it sounds unrealistic and like i’m exaggerating it, but i know what happened and how i felt. i was helpless and needed what i was craving. i’m now sober and disgusted with myself. my body is so used at such a young age, i’ve seen so many things i shouldn’t have seen, and i feel like i have 0 worth and am a sex doll  because people only really look at me in that way - but it’s my fault. the urges for drugs also come back to haunt me. i’m ashamed of everything i did, i was so fucked up. i hoed around with men for FUN. i can’t really tell people any of this in person because they’d be terrified of me. it’s so embarrassing god i’m ashamed of myself. not many people really realize how bad, depressing, and scary it was or what it was like for me either. okay rant over. on the bright side i’ve come really far and made progress, the past is just haunting"

AskReddit,fnje2ms,t3_g1jljr,1586997102.0,"i’m always, always asked about rape experiences. when i tell someone they normally ask really descriptive and specific questions which in turn trigger me. often times when i say it’s triggering, they keep going. i just find it so disrespectful, i know if i found out this happened to someone i’d just apologize and say they don’t deserve that but i get sexualized for it? it’s unfair. they’ll ask things like “what were you wearing?”, “how many people were there and can you describe them?”, “did they do (whatever it is)?”, “did you enjoy it?”, “have you orgasmed?”, “can i jack off to your experiences?”, and so on. there was even a guy who nicknamed one of the guys who hurt me. some of the questions are too disturbing to say - this is not what you say and do to a victim! we need support. if you don’t wanna give support, at least stay silent instead of bothering and or scaring us. i just feel so uncared for and worthless because of it. something else that bothers me is when people ask me things about my addiction, it just gives me urges. don’t question addictions unless the person says you can. another thing is when people ask questions about abuse i’ve encountered. i don’t want to describe my experiences. don’t just force questions out of me, if you wanna know about it then say you’re here if i wanna talk. i get asked things like “did they do (this) to you?”, “why did they do it to you?”, “what’d you do?”, “how bad did it hurt?”, etc. last thing is just things my mother says. she’s really messed up and some of the things she says are really offensive to me. i’m not gonna say much just because it might be too concerning for something under this post. but an example of her being just rude is her questioning why i’m not like my sister and why i do everything wrong. this is more of a rant than anything and i’m sorry about that. i’m just told at least one insensitive thing daily. i am sensitive, but i know a lot of things i’m told and asked are too far. i do think i deserve it, but deep down i wouldn’t respect it for anyone."

BPD,ffawyqa,t3_es1owp,1579746421.0,"I feel this way too, it got so bad earlier holy fuck. My ex was bragging about him being happy and I got so upset. The way I was thinking was “If he can be happy why can’t I?”, “Why don’t I ever get anything I want?”, “What am I doing wrong?”, “If he can be okay why can’t I be okay?”, “He’s happy without me so he never cared about me”. I ended up getting drunk then breaking up with my current boyfriend from anger, had sex with someone literally double my age, and had a mental breakdown after. I think it’s just jealousy. It makes you feel like why can they be happy but I can’t? It just feels so unfair. Idk it’s hard to explain but it just brings me down and makes me realize how unhappy I really am. Probably the same for you. But yeah when people leave and I see them happy, I just think my presence meant nothing to them and it hurts."

Her dad had to stay at work for 30 hours, they weren’t allowed to leave. I think the snow started on Thursday night and the city is in a state of emergency until Monday. There’s also the army there to find people, and there’s helicopters everywhere. Some people haven’t had power the whole time either.

Promiscuity after rape is a normal response, you’re normally terrified after rape, or promiscuous. There’s not a problem with either. What you’re doing is basically a way of coping, it’s more than likely you trying to gain the power back that you lost even though you might not realize it. You feel like if it’s your choice, what happened to you can’t happen again. It can be a way of gaining power, but of course not a good way. I’d say give it time and you’ll be better."
