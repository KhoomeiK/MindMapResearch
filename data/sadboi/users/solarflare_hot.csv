fastforward 6 months later i have been craving riding a bike so i bought a used bicycle to regain courage on two wheels and not even 5 minutes on it, the front wheel came off and i got scrapped off pretty good


my friends are telling me that i am cursed on two wheels but I'm craving riding a motorcycle like crazy and i can't shake the feeling. i get shivers and goospumps everytime i see or hear a motorcycle engine near by and i get really distracted by the bike. i don't care if it kills me. one day I'll be riding a bike again. i think that life is not worth living if you don't do what you like. i just hope that next time it just kills me and not leave me injured for life and dealing with the bills and unable to work."
