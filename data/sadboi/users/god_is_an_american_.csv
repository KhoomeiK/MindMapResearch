AskReddit,fmveml1,t3_fxjqxa,1586414346.0,"Hope this isn't coming in too late. Not a teacher but when I was in 6th grade I went to a small private school, only 12 kids in my class. During that school year a mom of one of the kids was arrested for plotting and killing his dad, which he found shortly after his death that it wasn't his biological dad like he thought. 

We were reading treasure island at the time and had a project to make our own pirate maps. We used markers and crinkled the paper a bit to make it look more realistic. I sat next to this kid and looked over to see him cutting himself with small scissors and letting the blood drop onto his map. I casually raised my hand and when the teacher got closer I pointed subtlety at the kid. She pulled him out of class and I'm not sure what happened next. Probably a call to child protective services"

medical,fdq1o9p,t3_emomq4,1578650465.0,"""globs"" of blood in your stool can be a serious issue. It's a sign of some kind of internal bleeding. Normally that would mean seeing a gastroenterologist as soon as possible but since that doesnt seem like an option then maybe an ER visit is the move. Not to say it would involve a whole hospital say but it would be a way to at least have the issue addressed.

Since the blood your discribed was clotted and dark, rather than red and liquid like, that's a immediate reason for concern already. Considering the symptoms you listed above, there's a few things that would be going on. Only certain tests could determine that but for sure get some help. Might now need to miss a lot of work but one day off for an ER visit wouldn't hurt."

The symptoms can become way more intense and I'm sorry your psychiatrist brushed it off. Maybe it doesn't sound like that big of an issue but those couple of days really do take so much more effort than normal. In my case I have to ground myself over and over again and remind myself that it's only worst because of my period. I've tried birth control and it definitely helped with anxiety and mood swings during that time but it's not a cure.

One night he called me and I couldn't make out a thing he was saying but he sounded upset and I knew something was wrong. He also had a history of multiple suicide attempts. Looking back now I should have absolutely called 911 first but instead I snuck out of my house and drove to his. Normally he'd sneak out to my car down the road but he wasn't answering my calls and his family was pretty absent so I just walked in his front door. I went to his room and he wasn't there, accidentally woke up his brother, and then went to check the bathroom. Found him covered in blood he'd vomited and passed out in. He was still kind of awake when I got to him and then called 911 and had to get his mom. He just wimpered and vomited small amounts of blood until paramedics came. Turned out he drank a lot of bleach."

Until I got to the week it was due without a single hour done yet. This was after I had at least 12 weeks to get it done but nope. So I did some research and found the places I could get in to volunteer the quickest. And somehow, by using every waking hour of my week (without taking off work either) got 20 hours in. It was approved by the organization only 2 hours before the cut off. It was stupid but also showed me that you at least have to try sometimes and you might suprise yourself."

AskReddit,ep9ioxg,t3_bu766u,1559110703.0,"In middle school I went to a small Christian School in Georgia, US. It was so small that most of the school was influenced by radical parents on the board and there was a LOT of weird stuff that went down. As I get older I realize more and more how messed up it was. So here are a couple stories.

Our 6th grade home room teacher was an EMT for a while and he told us a story once of how at his daughter's softball game a girl was seriously gashed by a fence or something. He said he had to act quick so he found a DEAD CAT and used slices of it's intestines as stitches. Probably didn't actually happen of course but I have friends who remember that story too and it all fucked us up a little. That guy was fired shortly after for other reasons.

At a retreat one weekend with the 7th grade class they separated the boys and girls and in our girls section they told us how single strapped back packs that go across our chest actually emphasis our breasts and that it's slutty. And pretty much that God was mad at us for it. So so so many girls left crying. Pretty disgusting actually to sexualize us like that. 

I remember too vividly how this one made me feel. Our 6th grade Bible class teacher decided one day to tell us, a bunch of 11 year olds, about Coulmbine in awful detail and how it was part of God's plan because one girl that died was a follower and her story lives on. This guy was also let go suddenly and mysteriously.  

A pair of seniors was count under the chapel having oral sex one day and the next chapel service they had the students on stage repent. Again, us 11 year olds were mortified but also when you're so young you don't know what to believe or how to feel about those sorts of things. 

That school closed after my 8th grade year for good reason."
