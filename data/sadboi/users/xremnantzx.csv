PostHardcore,fijarwm,t3_f6qdlk,1582440061.0,"Growing up in Vegas I got to see every band come through and see escape the fate get big in front of my eyes. I just grew into it from punk my first favorite band was penny wise and than I got into slipknot with Iowa and than after that it was just the flood gates opened. I first started listening to Underoath with the changing of times cd and then I got into the devil wears Prada Silverstein Chiodos BMTH the bled from first to last and so many more honestly it’s hard to name just 10. So here is my list 

1. Underoath - I’ve got 10 friends and a crowbar (secret song on they’re only Chasing Safety safety)
2. The devil wears Prada - hey john what’s your name again
3. Asking Alexandria - final episode
4. The bled - red wedding
5. ETF - situations
6. Bmth - pray for plagues 
7. Of mice and men - second and Sebring 
8. Memphis May Fire - cowbells making a comeback/ the deceiver 
9. Woe is me - delinquents 
10. Silverstein - sacrifice 

Honorable mention is Chiodos and DGD lol

I couldn’t leave them out and shit I still have more I can list."

Metalcore,fi75zkf,t3_f6qwbo,1582214997.0,I will check them out for sure. With a lot of my favorite bands becoming completely different like bmth and asking Alexandria it’s refreshing to find something new for once

depression,fhzu4h6,t3_f5n6zh,1582011854.0,I’m 34 and I’m in college only now so I feel the late bloomer thing.  I feel I am behind the curve ball already and it sucks. But I just try to keep pushing so finally I am in a career that is worth my age
depression,fhzu2f8,t3_f5ksud,1582011782.0,That is literally how I feel. One day I feel on top of the world. So confident in myself that I can achieve anything and I’m outgoing and funny and out of no where it hits me and I’m sad introverted (not that that’s a bad thing) just it’s a part of my depression I get self doubt. I feel worthless. It happened today right after my chemistry test. I did pretty good on it. I should feel happy. But I didn’t. I went to the gym anyways but I felt nothing inside. It’s gonna be hard to sleep tonight because I can’t relax. I feel uneasy. Sad and I just wish I could make it stop and go away again. We will just have to see when this roller coaster I am on is back up at the top and I’m on top of the world again
