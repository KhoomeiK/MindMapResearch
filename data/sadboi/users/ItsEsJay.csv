ARFID,fkn3i4r,t3_fjau58,1584351780.0,"I live with my parents who are luckily super understanding. My dad bought quite a lot of shelf stable safe foods (I didn't even ask for that) and my mum is trying her best to cook meals that I can eat. I hope it's staying this way, bc my mum already said she'll force me to eat if there aren't any save foods left... I understand her concerns (I'm already underweight so weight loss would be an issue), but my little ARFID-brain is still scared and is like ""all right Imma starve then""... But again, I'm so glad that I live in an understanding environment!"
depression,fkh78i8,t3_fibnaq,1584190963.0,"Last year I felt exactly the same (I was 15 at that time). My mom has depression so I, like you, refused the option that I may be depressed for a long time. Until one day I tried to kill myself. Luckily I got distracted by the confused looks of my cats (and I didn't want to hurt my gf at that time... I basically didn't wanna have such a negative impact on her life) so I stopped and nothing really happened. Then I finally realized that depression might be the answer and I got help. Now, one year later, I'm fine. It was a long time (about a year), but it has gotten sooo much better! 
Stay strong and try to reach out to your parents, friends or even a mental health professional. You got this, stay safe!"

INTP,fi3kk1q,t3_f68mpc,1582121479.0,"I still go to high school so I don't have that much important stuff to do. But recently I had a project in music production and I finished it about ten hours before it was due. We had several weeks to finish this project, but I finished it in approximately three ours. My teacher was amazed though and I got an A. That's probably the reason I still procrastinate - it somehow always turns out well...
And I hardly ever do my homework but if I do them it's mostly immediately before the lesson."

hsp,fhsrw5p,t1_fhsnijg,1581864505.0,"Same. I haven't found a solution yet (I doubt that there is one tbh...), but I think trying to accept it is the best thing you can do. Be patient with yourself and try to not pressure yourself too hard - it's just gonna make it worse. I don't know what your financial/health care situation is, but if it's possible maybe try cognitive behavioral therapy. I'm in therapy primarily because of some other issues, but in terms of being HSP it has definitely helped me a lot. Keep in mind that you're not alone! We're here, even though you don't always see us. Stay strong. Stay patient. You got this! Being HSP is exhausting, but it's also a gift!"
hsp,fhsm38u,t3_f4lsw5,1581862607.0,"Not exactly what you described, but quite similar. I often experience that I feel a lot of emotions n stuff simultaneously which makes me feel just completely overwhelmed. Then I either start crying or I completely zone out. After that I usually don't feel anything and that drives me crazy too..."

misophonia,fdggonn,t3_ekzm5z,1578395987.0,"I do both have synesthesia and misophonia. I never saw a link between these two but recently I read an article about misophonia being a form of synesthesia. For me it actually makes a lot of sense. The stuff I associated with my synesthesia (weekdays having colors, sounds having shapes and colors, etc.) never affected me in a negative way. The misophonia on the other hand (my absolute worst trigger sounds are squeaking/scratching knifes on plates and fingernails scratching on almost any type of surface) causes a variety of physical and mental reactions: I kinda feel like the ""fight or flight reaction"" is triggered... I'm super stressed out and get anxious and aggressive simultaneously even though I'm usually not a very aggressive person. If I can't go away (I often run away lol) it often happens that I hit on the table or even hit myself (only if I caused the noise though). Specific sounds just cause a severe pain that actually lasts quite a while. It's quite hard to explain, but I often compare the pain/sensation with someone poking your eardrums with a needle... hope I could help :)"
INTP,fbde4ui,t3_ecrotp,1576759182.0,"Well, it really depends on the song, my mood, the setting, etc. All in all I prefer rock or classic, but electronic music can (like any other genre) be nice occasionally."
ARFID,f8t9qpi,t3_e0v5r3,1574798852.0,"Uhm... that suggestion is probably quite odd, but it worked for me. I recently tried roasted crickets and I actually was able to eat them. I usually have a huge issue with texture and consistency, but crickets have a similar texture as most of my safe foods (crispy). Furthermore the taste is surprisingly neutral (maybe a nutty aftertaste). 
Hope I could help! Good luck :)"
ARFID,f7o78tm,t1_f7nrpdr,1573922159.0,"That's in my opinion very good explanation!  I too have foods I don't like, but I can physically stand and foods (if they're inhomogeneous) I physically can't eat."
ARFID,f7nfkbq,t3_dx4vee,1573900617.0,"That's actually pretty hard to explain... and everybody's different I assume, so I'm gonna talk about my personal experiences here. I actually still don't quite understand what's going on in my mind even though I have ARFID my entire life. Personally I have a great issue with texture, so even though I like the smell/taste it's likely that I just can't handle the consistency. It's like a blockade - I just can't eat it. I'm underweight too and I too understand that I'm lacking nutritions and that my diet isn't quite healthy. But even with that knowledge I just can not eat some foods. It's just physically impossible. Even if I somehow manage to put it in my mouth, I wouldn't be able to chew on it or even swallow it. I just start gagging and my system is super stressed about it. 

I tried my best to explain, but it's just very difficult...
Hope I could help you at least a little!"

weed,f6yq2hp,t3_dttqf1,1573291236.0,Have you talked to them? Maybe they just don't know they're stinking up your apartment. I'm sure that's not their intention. Try having a conversation with them making clear you don't want them to get in trouble but you have a problem with the smell inside your apartment. Maybe that solves the problem without fighting and getting them in trouble. Good luck!
actuallesbians,f6ypops,t3_dttm9q,1573290792.0,"Hey there! 

It'll probably take some time and that's okay! Everybody has somewhat gone through this. Depending on your environment it can be tough, but you'll make it - I promise! Love is something incredible nice so fight for it. Fight for your rights, fight for love! You're gonna win, even though there will might be times you feel like giving up. 

One thing from personal experience: labels can be helpful - having a term to describe yourself with and explain yourself to others, but you don't have to lable yourself. Sometimes you just don't fit into a specific lable and that's totally fine! Be yourself, weather you lable yourself or not.

And keep in mind: love always wins! ðŸŒˆ
Peace out!"
