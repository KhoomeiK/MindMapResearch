depression,fmnwu4c,t3_fw7p25,1586237648.0,I usually cope this way. Any small amount of stress? Sleep. Shitty day? Sleep. Life is just shitty? Sleep. Sick/pain? Sleep. It‚Äôs one of my biggest coping mechanisms. I don‚Äôt have to endure whatever it is that‚Äôs upsetting me if I just sleep for 18 hours right? But of course that and anxiety cause a lot of trouble for me trying to stay on track at work.
