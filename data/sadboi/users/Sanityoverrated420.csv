Just cuz someone forgets your anniversary or birthday doesn't mean they don't love you and shouldn't be something to get upset over. This is real life, not a dumb sit-com with a way over-used sexist joke.

Remembering game dates is easy cuz that shit is all over the internet.

If its something important to you, remind him of the dates coming up, mark it down for him or some shit. The fact that he remembered at all without you reminding him is nice and you should be happy rather than being mad at him.

And yeah, this pandemic has ppl all out of sorts. I almost missed out on 4/20 cuz I was so distracted and that's a big thing for me lol.

Also, I'm a woman and I have been with my partner for over 5 years and still need to have our anniversary written down. I can remember the month but that's about it lol. He isn't good with any dates or bdays so I just remind him and that works for us.

Literally remembering dates like that has nothing whatsoever to do with how much someone loves you. I think that's what your problem is, you feel like it's something important and represents how much he cares for you. 

Something I had to realize is how much that shit is ingrained in society but if you think about it, it really is not a big deal. I used to care more about that stuff until I thought abt it and realized how dumb it really is.

The fact that it automatically made you think less of her is pretty shitty. She's your gf, you either love her unconditionally (obviously doesn't mean put up with abuse) or you don't. Money shouldn't matter.

Communication is key and you both need to be able to tell each other how you feel without the other person talking down to you or belittling your problems. All that does is lead to your partner shutting you out and finding other people to share their problems with.

TwoXChromosomes,fpc8r2o,t1_fpc5u3u,1588491493.0,"I think men seem less scared cuz they just don't talk about it. Talking about it is seen as weak if you're a man. I mean just look at how society treated Johnny Depp and now it's undeniable that she was the sole abuser. Society has only just now gotten to where women are more comfortable to come forward about abuse (still not where we need to be though) and it's just now finally starting for men too. 

I think people are abusive in general and abuse is a cycle and it goes for any gender. There are men who suffer PTSD from abuse from women and can't date anyone cuz of it. 

Now I'm not saying this to downplay what women experience in anyway because society has a history of degrading and abusing women in general. It's so ingrained in society a specific idea of what being a ""lady"" is and that men are stronger that I think it has caused so many problems for everyone involved. Men have to be tough and not show emotion other than aggression and are taught if they don't fuck a bunch of women they aren't a man. Women are told they can't be a distraction and to protect their sexuality at all costs. If they get unwanted sexual attraction it's their fault.  The list goes on and on.

I will say, I've personally known more women who've been abuse victims than men (at least who have opened up to me or I've witnessed) but it's not by  whole lot more cuz honestly, a lot of the women I've known who were abused ended up so fucked up that they became an abuser to others including men. Also most of the abusers I've known were also victims of abuse, regardless of gender.

Sorry for long comment, I'm just passionate about this stuff and think about it often. Plus I think it's good for people to discuss these things in a healthy way."

She dropped the charges to get him back. Idk what happened to them but I hope he and the kid got away from her.

Just to be clear, I am a woman and have had really bad experiences with men getting quite aggressive with rejection and my mom literally spent 30 miserable years with my dad cuz he threatened to kill himself when she rejected his proposal. I'm sure women are way more apt to be at danger for rejecting a man. But I do believe it happens with men more often than you would think simply because men are less likely to come forward about it cuz of the stigma that men can't be abused by women and if they are, then it's funny and/or cute."

But the shows I'm talking about are shows like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, breaking bad, South Park, and rick and Morty. Most if not all the characters are not good people in these shows, you're not ever meant to like them or their actions. It's always sunny is like the perfect example because it's literally about alcoholics who run a bar and always do the most fucked up shit which destroys other peoples lives including their own by always scheming to scam people. They make fun of everything (nothing is off limits) and in a way that the characters are always the butt of the joke. South Park uses humor to raise awareness to different problems with society in a way that shows how fucking dumb people are and it's so brilliant. But also it's sometimes just dumb to be funny which I love too. Breaking bad is a normal dude who turns to making meth which shows how most normal people are just a few bad days away from being criminals themselves and criminals are humans too.

Let's face it, cashiering is 70% being yelled at by guests for something you can't control. 10% actually ringing stuff up, and 20% running around trying to catch up on the main stuff you're supposed to be doing (running strays, claims, zoning and stocking registers, trash, carts, and whatever random shit managers decide to throw at you). More people will be buying stuff cuz of the ease and therefore will need more people stocking.

He was making jokes the whole time between songs and everyone was laughing. It was clearly an act. And all the videos of him doing stuff like that on stage is clearly acts. He'll then make references to that stuff in his interviews that ppl dont get unless they were actually at the concert which makes the experience even more awesome.

He finally said fuck this, I said I was willing to die for music and I meant it and did a concert anyway. A bunch of asshats attended the concert with laser pointers pointed at it to scare him off stage but he stayed and performed anyway. He's very much still relevant and has a huge fanbase, but even his own fanbase sucks cuz a lot of them believe all the made up bullshit the media puts out about him and don't actually do their research or watch his interviews to fully understand what his music and whole persona really is about. 

I grew up believing he was possessed by demons and the Antichrist, he terrified me until I saw his bowling for columbine interview. Finding out that everything I knew about him was a lie was what started me questioning everything I'd ever been taught and how important doing research is.

It's already traumatic enough the fact that you're raising a kid together separated, you don't need to add a fuck ton more mental health problems by using her to fuck with her dad. She will only end up hating you as an adult when she has processed everything that went on, but it sounds like she has a great dad (which is funny cuz you were trying not to make him sound great) and she'll just continue her relationship with him and cut you off unless you grow the fuck up and be a parent who looks for the best for their kid and not their own selfish vendetta."
