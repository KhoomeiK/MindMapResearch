BearableApp,fr1go0y,t3_gm4o7g,1589819401.0,"Currently you can only select Factors either for the whole day or for 4 different time periods.  

This idea here would be if you held down the factor, you would be presented with a pop up where you could select much more specific time periods by either pressing or holding and dragging down through 15 minute intervals.   The option would still be there to select the whole time period (as you currently can do) by pressing e.g. am/mid etc. 

I think this could be really cool if applied to symptoms too and would allow for some really accurate and unique insights.

Another side benefit would be to make the homepage less cluttered by the current time periods toggle, which doesn't look great when you have a lot of factors."
BearableApp,fr0gr55,t3_glrprl,1589795078.0,"Thanks for the request.

This is the first time we've had this request, but if we get more we'll definitely consider it.

Our hope is that we will make medication entry a lot better in the future and accurately give insights into how much each med/supplement improves mood/symptoms.  Although it would be a bit tricky with supplements, as it's not like they all have immediate impacts or are taken always for specific reasons."

I’m releasing the full app for app free for a couple of months as we wanted to give you guys at least something to use during these strange times as a thank you for all the feedback you’ve given so far.

A lot of improvements still have to be made and there are some features like an updated Food Diary that still haven’t been implemented. We are also planning a big overhaul to the insights pages and adding a weekly report feature in the next few months.

I kept holding off releasing it to the public because I wanted it to be perfect, but we really need to get it into more peoples’ hands to really test it properly. Now is as good a time as ever during this crazy pandemic, so I really hope it can be useful for staying on top of your mental and physical health.

Also you can rearrage items on the homepage if you want to put medication on the top"
BearableApp,fo9x1f0,t1_fo9g49a,1587633728.0,"I'm actually leaning against this idea now, as it didn't get much traction at all and would be a big costly change.  For now at least...

But what I will try to change is making it smoother, so that when you scroll down for example the top of the section sticks to the top of the page, so you can easily minimise that section without scrolling up.  Also I'm going to try and make it so that there is a down arrow button (like on the Reddit app) which automatically closes the section you're on and takes you to the next section.  Would those things be useful to you?

Thanks"

An appetite tracker is a nice idea, it's pretty niche however, so I'm sure you can understand I have to focus on the really important stuff first.  I'll definitely keep it mind though.  For now you could try adding an Appetite category in the Factors section with all the relevant factors you want and then you could see what your appetite was vs medication using the timeline search.  

Eventually we'll have more detailed symptom entries yes :)

We're renovating the food diary section next, so you'll be able to add snacks and drinks.

Thanks again!"

migraine,fo764o7,t3_g648dw,1587572910.0,"I wanted to let you guys know that you could start using the app today after I got a really good response from your community [**when I last posted**.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Menieres/comments/dl6okw/every_since_losing_my_job_due_to_health/)

Thanks to the help of your community and other chronic health condition communities like Fibromyalgia, CFS, MS, Crohns and many more, we've managed to put something together based on the requests and feedback of testers and our community members over at [https://www.reddit.com/r/BearableApp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BearableApp/) (feel free to join us over there if you want to further contribute to the requests and feedback)

I’m releasing the full app for app free for a couple of months as we wanted to give you guys at least something to use during these strange times as a thank you for all the feedback you’ve given so far.

A lot of improvements still have to be made and there are some features like a separate Sleep section (coming within the next week) and an updated Food Diary that still haven’t been implemented. We are also planning a big overhaul to the insights pages and adding a weekly report feature.

I kept holding off releasing it to the public because I wanted it to be perfect, but we really need to get it into more peoples’ hands to really test it properly. Now is as good a time as ever during this crazy pandemic, so I really hope it can be useful to those with chronic health issues during this time, to stay on top of your mental and physical health.

I hope you guys are keeping well, sorry for the wait!
