We are mad at the fact that he is clearly trying to use it as an excuse to why he wanted to meet with underage girls, instead of getting help and admitting. The guy has mental issues and clear stuff going on within himself and he deserves therapy for this. The jail system is shit and he will get beaten to a pulp, child predators are notoriously beaten by inmates. The other thing is that he obviously is still a human inside..but his actions and urges are horrifically bad and will forever be. They will never be justified, but they can be identified to what might be going on. Humanity will forever disgust me and confuse me but I honestly am just hoping things will get better. I hope we can get rid of these urges for people, so they can live normal lives and have healthy sexual urges, not filth like this."
