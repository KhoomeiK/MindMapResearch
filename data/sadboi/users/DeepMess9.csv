I like to use Lorde’s Supercut as an example of this. She takes an idea that’s pretty common (a relationship that’s ended) but she puts a twist on it with the concept of a ‘supercut’. This concept impacts her imagery and word choices for the rest of the song. You just need to find your ‘supercut’ for this! good luck!

Songwriters,fqsk23t,t3_gkjr8x,1589609486.0,"To follow up with the comments you’ve been receiving, yes, the song is just you and an acoustic guitar. I, personally, do not feel very enthralled by that ensemble, so I would agree with the band suggestion. Or, if you don’t want to join a band, you can learn to mix acoustic and electronic instruments to be your own band. I will also say I don’t think your voice is horrible- Lou Reed is one of my favorite musicians ffs- but for the genre you seem to be singing (singer/songwriter?) you don’t really fit the style. I’m not an expert on this genre by any means because it’s not my cup of tea, but you seem closer to the vowel technique of Tom from Blink-182. I would recommend studying the singing technique of the genre you’re going for, because the notes are there. It’s just a bit wide and it might be off-putting if you’re used to a standard within that genre.
edit: i should also say you have a very nice voice! i don’t think your voice is bad by any means. i actually think in different styles in would be seen as a strength. i just think it’s not naturally the kind of voice people are used to with acoustic singer-songwriter stuff."

AmItheAsshole,fofxgdz,t3_g72ody,1587744516.0,"INFO - How much does your daughter weigh? I remember being  called ‘chubby’ as a kid and actually being considered medically ‘obese’ for my height. This translated to ‘morbid obesity’ as an adult, of which I then had to deal with and lose (still losing). I was severely bullied and developed life long psychiatric conditions including borderline personality disorder because of my weight and have attempted suicide twice due to the trauma from being bullied and my parents hating me for my size.

I don’t think your wife’s reaction was the right one, but- I think your wife is scared. I personally am terrified to have children for this very reason, because body image and weight is so tricky. Although anorexia is serious, being overweight is still serious. I think you should hear your wife’s concerns as well, but in a much healthier way. Talk to a doctor. See what you can do for your daughter. Don’t put her on a ‘diet’ willy nilly, don’t LECTURE HER ABOUT CAKE of course, but as a family: ask a medical professional if she’s at risk for health problems later in life and then get practical advice. And please, if she is overweight, tackle it early. If she struggles with over eating, tackle it early. It will get worse and part of a parents job is to teach self care activities like proper nutrition and portion sizes. But again, and I cannot stress this enough: ASK A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL FIRST. She’s way too young for you to be able to judge if her weight is ok for her height & age off looks alone."

Songwriters,fo0wd5s,t3_g50aw1,1587421009.0,"I think that there’s a lot of work to be done. The rhyming schemes seem off to me & the lyrics lack poeticism (in my opinion). They’re not horrible lyrics, but you’re conveying some pretty basic notions (loss and love) and then conveying them in similarly basic ways. 

For example, you say ‘it hurts’. While this is what is occurring, we want the experience surrounding this hurt described to us. Does it ache? Is it numb? Can you reach it? It is sharp? What does it taste like? Sound like? How does it impact the senses? ‘Hurt’ by itself is not impactful enough, because while ‘hurt’ could mean ‘left at an altar after my brother died on 9/11’, it could also mean ‘knee scrape’. I’ll link my favorite poet down at bottom- he does a fantastic job of describing romantic loss in a pretty simple yet brilliant way. Hope this helps!

Yeah, there are conventionally attractive people, but in the middle are where our preferences are. Just the other night I was out with a friend and a guy stopped to talk to us randomly about a poster we were looking at. I thought it was a bit odd that he’d approached us, but w/e. he was nice enough. afterword she says, ‘Oh my God, he was soo HOT!’ and I was like ‘i guess?’. He just wasn’t my type."

Edit: I have a burner phone already through straight talk. It’s a prepaid no contract plan on an old iphone. I could easily switch over to it but it just takes a lot of strength to let go of your mom like that."

AmItheAsshole,fiv2dgb,t3_f9xinq,1582752571.0,"NTA. I’m gonna go against the grain here, as i am biased because I am a university student. A lot of people are commenting, “It’s university policy, or “You should’ve emailed!” Every professor i’ve had (junior here) has said “Don’t email me when you’re not here” and professors have the ability to be flexible. There is a university policy for everything, but most professors can choose their own for attendance, grading, etc. Professors like to have a ‘I think i’m your only class/responsibility so I want to be treated as such’. I attend class/work (I work between classes) from 9-5, M-F (i’m in a major that requires friday classes). Sometimes, I need to miss class for life things. Like going to the secretary of state. Getting a tire replaced. The dentist. Things I cannot necessarily plan during the summer/a break. I had a teacher say to me, “You know you have a class during this time, why would you schedule a doctor’s appointment?” Like, uh, has it occurred to you that I am doing something during everyone else’s business hours all day every day? Life happens. It’s a flaw in the system."
AmItheAsshole,fiqojgh,t3_f9a3lc,1582648681.0,ESH - I still can’t get passed why you expected to be treated like a bridesmaid when you weren’t one. I also don’t think something like table placement is worth losing a friendship over.

The quality of your service is also dependent on cooks, bartenders, hostesses, bussers, managers/owners, etc. If things are going wrong/slow and a server is still attentive, friendly, and sympathetic I see no reason to take it out on them.

I also (once upon a time) would aim to eat 1200kcal but get frustrated and want to overeat. I would then overcompensate by under-eating. For me, it was because I was equally as hungry on 800 calories vs 1200 calories, so why bother? The solution was figuring out how to feel full on 1200. It’s hard; but possible. Tracking my macros/micros helps, aiming for quality of food over quantity of food, and understanding that my body “needs” more food to maintain it’s current size. That size is too big, but my body doesn’t know that. So patience with myself is important."
