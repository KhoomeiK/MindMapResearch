I try not to get too involved while I'm watching but I'll make sure he knows I'm there and says Hi Dad, I want him to do his thing but still check in.

But yeah, if you see someone and your going to prank or joke with around people say, I'm going to go fuck with him. If you were trying to say you were going to have sex with someone you wouldn't say, I'm going to fuck with them, you would leave the 'with' part out.

If I recall, you commented on a post that was made 2 days ago just to say something negative on what was positive thing because I didn't do it the way you liked and you have the nerve to say I'm triggered? Really? Thats funny. Is it that I got more Karma from this one post then you have in almost 4 years? Hmm. Your a sad petty person and glad my kid doesn't act that way. Its unfortunate though that it comes off that your parents didn't bother to really care or raise you properly. I don't give a fuck about you, not for a bit. I'm laughing about it with my friend right now. Either way, I'll let you get back to Dead By Daylight. Stay Classy Pump"
