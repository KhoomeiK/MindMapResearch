obeyme,fjxnbnb,t1_fjwjnx3,1583678591.0,"I think it isn't related to chapters, but more like how long you've been playing?? It's when Lucifer bans texting, right?"
obeyme,fjwgt3q,t1_fjwghlu,1583638922.0,"oh, i'm at chapter 18 so i think i know what u mean?? i didn't notice bc i was busy with school but if i was into it i think i'd cry"
obeyme,fjwf0k7,t1_fjwd8dz,1583638277.0,i'm catching up with the story and he texted me like 8 times... love that
obeyme,fjw8656,t1_fjw64vg,1583636501.0,"Honestly it's fun to imagine it like late night texts too, especially when it's the middle of the night and i can sleep bc some of them are adorable ðŸ¥ºðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ"
obeyme,fjw53ra,t1_fjw4vgz,1583635266.0,bro i love him so much but i'll be trying to sleep and i just hear that notification sound and want to SCREAM
FireEmblemHeroes,fjoagww,t1_fjo5c9f,1583523839.0,"He's not the primary attacker, he shares that spot with my Valentine's Conrad! Since he's more physical while Conrad has around 41 res and DC"

FireEmblemHeroes,fjnyi7l,t1_fjnye4p,1583516885.0,OH NO?? Oh my god i think i'd quit the game

FireEmblemHeroes,fjnxp5o,t1_fjnxgil,1583516415.0,"Got it. I've been sp grinding with him using what I gave him just to see if there's anywhere I can improve, and so far the only thing he can't survive is green mages, so I think that's a success. Pretty much any physical unit just bounces off of him"
FireEmblemHeroes,fjnx7c3,t1_fjnwym3,1583516130.0,"I'm not as much of an intense player when it comes to this game so I usually don't pull just for skills, fodder kinda finds me lol"

FireEmblemHeroes,fjnwbf5,t1_fjnw28u,1583515613.0,"Sorry for the confusion! It's weird, honestly. I know it was steady stance too, because i was trying to use a dupe brave ike as fodder"
FireEmblemHeroes,fjnw0xp,t1_fjnvgdg,1583515457.0,"Fair enough. I could put DC on him, but the lowered attack makes it feel like it wouldn't be worthwhile"
FireEmblemHeroes,fjnvjrr,t1_fjnuohr,1583515204.0,"Weird, i tried to get steady stance on Ferdie but it said the movement type wasn't allowed."
FireEmblemHeroes,fjnuff2,t1_fjnto0y,1583514623.0,"I actually didn't use anything from the stance series, i think it's a movement type thing"
FireEmblemHeroes,fjnsv3z,t1_fjnsfa5,1583513797.0,"Vanguard seems to be the best choice though!! On specific enemy turns he will go up to 52 defense, and if i throw on close def it'll go to 58, which is as high as my previous physical tank. He Deserves To Be Strong."
FireEmblemHeroes,fjnrnlc,t1_fjnrei2,1583513202.0,"i've given him pretty much everything except the C skill right now, no issues yet. Also, are you sure Berkut's Lance would be a good choice? I'm aiming more for physical defense because I already have a unit that specializes in resistance."

Vocaloid,fj74k4t,t3_fbxwzj,1583086331.0,i literally feel so stupid asking for help but i used to love this song when i was in middle school and it just came back to me but i can't remember anything other than it was underwater and about some lonely kid/robot/whatever alone in there
