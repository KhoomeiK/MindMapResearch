mentalhealth,fpiv4ko,t1_fpiutl9,1588649431.0,"I don't think so that texting works via the platform that I suggested. Maybe you can google out other websites where you can text with mental health professionals for help ? However, I really do think that atleast an audio consultation is something that you should have. Its hard for medical professionals to infer how you're feeling only via a text (I'm guessing) and therefore limits their ability to help you."
mentalhealth,fpitzd1,t1_fpitq78,1588648673.0,"If you aren't comfortable with video, you can request them for an audio only consultation. I'm sure they'll accomodate that. I once had an audio only consultation with a psychiatrist.

However, I am consulting a therapist as well as a psychiatrist, for free ! I do so via online (video) consultations. Here's a link to the website - https://covidav.com/ 

Its super easy to book a consultation there. All you have to do is mentally take a step towards accepting professional medical help. I'm sorry if I cannot be of any more help, as I need to help myself first. I hope you find peace and feel better soon."

This was the first time I've ever sought medical help with regards to my mental health. I've done so via https://covidav.com/. It's an easy process to book an online (video) appointment there. And also, it's free ! I've had 3 sessions so far with my therapist, and they've been good. As I'm having suicidal thoughts, I've been referred to a psychiatrist. I also keep having anxiety attacks. 

I highly recommend that you use that resource to consult a therapist. You need not tell your parents about it if you aren't comfortable telling them. I haven't told mine.

BreakUp,fmlm35z,t1_fmljhkk,1586189061.0,"I'm so sorry to hear that. Yes,  I cannot even imagine how it will for both of us when college resumes, as we'd be seeing them everyday, but nothing would be like before. 

I was in love with someone else for around 7 years, after which at one I finally decided to let go completely, and decided I had moved on.  I then finally decided that I was ready to date. I started dating this girl (who recently broke-up with me). It took me only 3 weeks to tell her I loved her, but I said it because I genuinely felt it. I was afraid of getting too attached, because my past experience had ruined me ..but I was ready to love again. 

She  confessed her love for me yesterday (5th April) , after we had finished arguing on a call. The day also happened to be our 2 month anniversary (I know, sounds so silly). 

Today, she called me up and said that she was not ready to date and that it wasn't working out. She said she didn't want to be overbearing on me due to her sensitivities. She said she loved me, but she didn't want to continue dating. 

It's broken me. After so long I had let someone go, in the hope that I would find someone more accepting and reciprocating of my love and admiration..and when I finally did find her, she ended it with me. I was not ready for a heartbreak so soon. 

I hope you find what you're looking for. In case you ever want to chat,my inbox is always open."
BreakUp,fmklh3a,t1_fmiqq23,1586159116.0,"I hope you take care of yourself. 

She broke up with me about an hour ago...
Quarantine separation definitely had something to do with it.Although we were dating for just 2 months, we had already confessed to loving each other. 
She said she needs some time, and that she'll think about it once college resumes. 

I'm still processing this. It's like being hit by a truck on the highway. I haven't told my friends yet because I don't want to burden them with my troubles. My mental health already wasn't in a good place because of the quarantine (my country's in a lockdown) ..I'm going to be a mess now.

I can't fathom not spending time with her when our college resumes. Not going on those walks with her at night. Not hugging her. Not sharing the blanket with her. Not dancing with her. Not talking my heart out with her..
 
I'm going to miss her so much ..I hope she reconsiders her decision..I really do hope so."
