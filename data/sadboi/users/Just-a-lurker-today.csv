I’m not the most mentally healthiest individual and on some level I think she knows that and has visibly seen what that means for how I act. I’m a good guy I think - the record shows i don’t take advantage of people - it’s just the record also shows I’m mentally unbalanced (from my angle).

She leaves on the 4th and comes back on the 9th. I’ll try reconnecting then and doing stuff together.

I’ll give you my trigger and result.

My roommate and I got drunk, she had BF issues. I nearly got with her. But even piss drunk both she and I knew I just was too fuckin numb and only was going through the motions of faking passion. 

Imagine that. Making out in a living room in the middle of the night nearly blacked out and you’re just faking it til you can make it cause you feel no passion for the situation one way or another. 

I ended up ending it that night both due to her being too drunk and myself too disconnected and numb. Then I took a half hour walk in the early morning to cool off and think over my thoughts. I left on a trip that morning smelling heavily like vodka and other alcohol, depressed, with my shirt backwards. 

Skip a-week  forward, I had been occupied with work so I couldn’t mentally address the issue and my depression properly. I ended up going out with some friends and we were all drunk and went to a 24/hr food place. The time we were there we began talking about what happened. 

My family doesn’t cry in front of people if at all. I kept having to leave to go to the bathroom. Not to piss the alcohol out but to cry my eyes out and compose myself before others would see. My roommates never noticed. 

Later that night at home, I talked with the person again about how shitty I felt and cried visibly in front of them. I completely broke down like never before in my entire life.

MarchAgainstTrump,esbw5by,t1_esblu7h,1561813558.0,"Thank you for taking your time to write back in such a fashion. I apologize if I came off too... intense. Usually these differences in opinion devolve into mudslinging and admittedly I believe   I’m guilty of taking that first step. I’d like to correct that. That all said, let’s begin. I’ll try to remain concise as responding to these long posts can be a real pain and time consuming for such a small thing. 

In the first point on family values and I understand the confusion as I badly explained that...

What I mean to address is that firstly the Republican Party, compared to the Democratic Party, is no matter how you look at it is overwhelmingly valued to what an American family is.  

Furthermore,  reason I bring up the Democratic Party’s... failures of policy’s and practices they support ( in my view) are because they symbolize the moral degradation of their party compared to the Republican’s. There is a line, and it is a clear one, between supporting social advocacy and immoral depravity. While it may be true that outwardly the Republican family values idea is hurt by having Trump for example, the fact is, they are still actively promoting it and supporting it both in speech and policy which, even if they have some individuals who give them a bad name, does not remove them from the fact that they are indeed still the party of family values as their beliefs, policies, and spoken word are still in line and supportive of that. 

An apt example to this situation ( with a major difference) of where the Democratic Party would be similar to the Republicans is in the family values situation compared to the Democratic Party’s socialism situation. What I mean should be simple. To understand what is supported by a party or person(s), we must look at policy, written and spoken word, and actions.

- As mentioned earlier, these qualifications all verify Republican pro-family values orientation.
- Democratic Party wise, these don’t fall in line with their official stance on not being a socialist supporting party. The reason? Their written and spoken word don’t correspond with their actions.

The reason I bring up Obama’s debt compared to Trump’s current and theoretical is actually more nuanced than I think picked up. 

The reason I brought this up is because we must look at who is running. As we currently in this, it seems we are complaining about Trump’s spending. So, therefore, I indeed must beat the dead horse on who he ran against and the circumstances as if it wasn’t him it would be Hilary.  

Trump may have put us more in debt but he’s following up on a President who put us there in that situation. In other words, these first few years of Trump are damage control. The reason I bring up Hilary (and ought to bring up future democrat contenders) is because if she was elected the policies would’ve continued. The importance this? It means the spending would’ve been exponentially more in Hilary’s term as she would be continuing on what Obama had started the ball rolling on. Trump ended it meaning less spending than what it would’ve been. That said, it’s not easy or painless and yes, Trump incurred financial loss in the form of debt due to these Obama era policies he is fighting and ending. 
 
In short, you are right. Complaining about Obama and Hilary is useless and irrelevant... if it’s just that. But that’s not what this is and you might have missed that. This is a comparison of the past and how it effects our present and future. To ignore Obama’s horrible political and debt incurring policies and the Democratic plan to continue them both back in 2017 and today is disingenuous. 

Moving on. Then we talk about Trump’s racism. Really though, he’s not. Sexist as the next guy with any testerone perhaps, that I can see. But a racist? Nah, the record really shows that he’s actually supported minorities. His policies for example have led to record low black unemployment for example. 

But what are you referring to when you say, “ He’s racist?” It’s such a buzzword really so I’ll even address a couple of the usages where he’s been called that. 

- “Shithole countries”: Decried as racist because it’s about South American and African countries. Is it though? They are shitholes if the people of those countries are running in fear due to oppression and overwhelming poverty. That said, the only time it is our true duty to accept fleeing individuals is when there is a credible threat and they are persecuted and in danger. A vast majority of what we have coming are illegal economic immigrants. Worse still, by accepting these people, we are aiding foreign politicians avoidance of unfucking their own country. 
- Crackdown on illegal immigrants? They are illegals. End of story. 
- Somali Refugees? 100% not only a shithole of a country but a great deal of crime and terrorism spreading from its portion of the populace that’s extreme both back in Somali and in the USA and other Western states. 
- Ban In Muslim mainly countries over terrorism concerns? Take a map and look at where the cause and origin of terrorist organizations and proliferation of their extremist ideology has occurred among the governments and populace. Hint: it’s the Middle East. Apparently Muslim people mainly live there and apparently extremist Muslims are the ones who practice terrorism and Jihad... funny that. 

What does all this have in common? It’s all the truth. The question is will you believe it or the lies. I remember back when the migrant Europe crisis was occurring and even with the US illegal immigrant issue... 

They said no terrorists are going to go the long route by infiltrating caravans. Low and behold, now I see articles ( and they aren’t by Fox or even conservatives) that people were killed or robbed or raped or molested by criminals or terrorists who came from those very same shithole countries via immigrant caravans and got in because people’s decency and kindness led to a critical error of simple common sense.

I understand your disillusionment with the Republicans currently, but the record is showing they are still much more moderate (and yes Trump too is not only more moderate than most actually and more genuine in his lack of a filter) than the Democrats who shifted much farther left. 

I think it’s a sad new era of politics that started around Trump and the end of the Democrats failed attempt to finalize and cement Obama’s policies. It’s an era where the Democratic Party and to a lesser extent, the Republicans, are shifting policies and viewpoints. 

- On the Republican side, it’s a shift to a type sensationalism that only the Democrats previously had down pat. 

- On the Democratic Party we see a regrettable shift away from traditionally being the party of the “heart” ( as I’ll call it) to a party splint between socialism and traditional Democratic Party values

Thank you for your time. This was a bit overwritten in my end but hopefully it’s clarified some things."
EnoughTrumpSpam,es9rxwc,t1_es45cyc,1561743145.0,I mean.. kind of right when even mentioning *The_ Subreddit’s* name will get you censored by reddit. Awfully anti- 1st amendment
MarchAgainstTrump,es9qfwm,t1_es9k5k8,1561742165.0,"I’ll get into why I take it more seriously ( albeit with my own statements at the end)

Lol, family values. Personally I don’t give a fuck about those as much as I do about our country. But if you REALLY want to get into that... then it’s clear the one degrading family values in the party that supports children in drag and supporting illegals getting votes ( because why else would opposing a census be? Racism is just the buzzword to win the court case). 

Debt wise; we have to take the just general fact the country is in the shitter money wise and we will accumulate debt no matter what. That’ said, Trump’s 2 Trillion from 2-3 years is pennies compared to Obama’s 9 Trillion over 8 years. Let’s say Trump wins. Even then we’ll still be around 3 less trillion in debt compared to Obama.  But why does this matter? Well, Hillary would’ve added to existing Obama policies which would’ve made her presidency much more expensive as, naturally ( and it’s not purely a bad thing) Democrat’s are focused more on social works. 

Don’t talk to me about law and order. The Democratic Party supports illegal voting by illegal immigrants by preventing citizenship questions (which matters as this effects the popular and electoral voting). Additionally, y’all support Sanctuary Cities and actively work against federal law enforcement carrying out duties to protect our citizens by removing and processing illegal immigrants. 

Key word in all this that leftists forget? Illegal. You can view it to be a shit law that people coming in without permission or vetting are illegal... but despite that it’s still illegal that they are. Don’t like the law? Change it. But until then? Stop breaking the goddamn law and endangering US citizens. 

And then you have Hilary. Oh boy... she’s a character. 
She’s for example was guilty and is guilty of manipulating her party to silence Sanders and definitely had anywhere from a handful to couple dozen people killed when they could connect her to illegal acts. Additionally, she’s threatened ( an ironic twist) those who have made rape claims about her beloved Bill Clinton. You know? The president who fucked his secretary and left a mess on the dress and bounced due to impeachment. Great choice to vote for his morally and ethically dubious wife who has a long list of people close to her personally or were involved in crime investigations about her who died suspiciously.

But you know the great thing about American law? Innocent before proven guilty. She killed the witnesses so she’ll get away with it. That said, same goes for Trump. Who knows? Maybe *one* claim is true and he did some illegal shit... but the fact is he’s won in court against libel and the people claiming this bullshit never came forward until... very curiously... when he became president. How strange /s. 

The thing with Democrats right now is that your mantra is old. You’ve called him a racist for example but it doesn’t seem to really make sense. Hell, if anything, Trump is actually more moderate. 

He’s been called a populist, moderate republican, centrist Democrat (on social issues), liberal on social issues, socially conservative, nationalist, nativist, and protectionist to name a few descriptions from experts on both sides. Take that as you will but for me it means we have a president who’s ironically more moderate than likely any other candidate despite the reputation. Even more ironic considering he’s with Republicans. Meanwhile... the democrats are facing a crisis between growing socialist and moderate forces.

I mutually respect and appreciate your respect for the right to be in another party but the issue with your party, and you aren’t refuting it I notice, is that only your people are the ones who I’ve heard actively say the country would be better off entirely without opposition. The Republicans and right leaners have their own bullshit spouted by ordinary people as well but from what I’ve heard it’s typically just in in the form of a negative response to those one-party state suggestions.

Ironically I said the same thing throughout hs. But who knows, I feel like I’m being led to something at times, maybe it’s a release, one way or another."

Issue with that idea is it’s impossible in the sense even if lawmakers could pass it, it would become so different in intent and design from the original..."
SuicideWatch,epmqee2,t1_epmmy6l,1559316251.0,"It doesn’t make that much sense though because I’ve had this sick, pervasive interest in finding out recently what people think of me. And was way too open recently about who I am and how fucked up my POV is I think. 

I literally told a girl while in a Uber with them I’d jump out of the car just cause I could . And later, I made the crackhead, crazy person of our group fuckin scared. I made them scared, the one who is if I had to guess got just as much shit behind closed doors as I do"
SuicideWatch,epmp4qj,t1_epm6amx,1559315816.0,"I’ve cried twice now in front of a girl I don’t know that wasn’t family. EVER. All in the last week. 

At one point I had to go to the bathroom, three times actually, to cry in there silently for a few minutes before walking out like nothing happened. From what our conversation was like during and after, I think they just thought I was drunk af. I wasn’t, just sad over some personal shit i had learned regarding their perspective of a hookup.

Mixed relief and mixed depression. I learned about their perspective on the events ( they had none they could even remember supposedly...), my morals ( I maintained em) and how I realized just how numb I was even during a fuckin’ hookup. 
It’s complicated but that’s the best way I can describe it"

What I suggest is find some hobbies, try to make some friends. If you know what makes you sad, try to address it.

Don’t, please don’t, let this fester. It’s not healthy, I know."
