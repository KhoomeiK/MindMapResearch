bipolar,fqmxsxk,t1_fqmlk75,1589485319.0,"I had a long convo with mine the other day because of some med changes that made me suicidal. I had already been in contact with my medical and support team and just went to him to feel comforted. But his first reaction was to say “well maybe stop messing with your meds” as if I’m just carelessly tossing pills in my mouth, or that I don’t have a really great system in place. Like, when I need to be comforted, having to defend such a simple request is so hurtful and isolating. I’m not just a walking embodiment of bipolar. I can actually parse through everything very effectively. I asked for an apology and he was like “idk why I should have to feel bad that I said that” as if me asking for an apology is synonymous with requiring a sense of guilt. And sure as shit, the next day he had a bad day and asked for comfort and I gave it to him no questions asked. I’m so tired and alone."

But first I have to wade through being interrupted and being told I’m overthinking things. It’s only after I prove that I’m not being crazy that I actually get a chance to voice my concern. At which point I have to fight through more interruptions and misconceptions.

And as much as I would love for C to be the answer, I really don’t think it is. Some people need their consistency more than they need their creativity. It’s a survival thing at that point."
bipolar,fpm6wyb,t1_fpkuz1u,1588726796.0,"I feel like my medication finally allows me to be more consistently in touch with my creative and engaged side. It may be my comorbid ADD coming into play, but my meds are the only reason why I can count on myself to do anything when I’m home from work. Without them I’d occasionally have a burst of inspiration, but it would only be 4-8 times a year. Now I finally feel like I’m working a bit closer to full capacity. Like, I can get through existence without feeling the “Sunday’s Scaries” about literally everything. The weight is still pulling at me. I only ever feel like I’m just a step or two to the side of The Pit. But that’s also after a year and a half of trial and error. Unless you’ve exhausted your options, don’t be afraid to ask if you have another one. 

Edit: This is coming from someone who is a “difficult case” according to multiple professionals because I’m so sensitive and reactive to drugs. From my windpipe closing up, to getting hives, to passing out, to getting other mental/ physical reactions, it is always worth testing your options if you aren’t happy with where you are. It doesn’t mean that something will be better. But you took that same grain of salt when you started trying meds in the first place."

For me, vyvanse removes the fog of existing and makes starting tasks a lot easier. I’ve noticed though, I’ve been hypomanic for about 5 months now ( which is when I started vyvanse). Even though my depression is just a step away, not being depressed for so long has been unprecedented for me. I asked this because I wanted to see if it’s maintainable. I already take magnesium to reduce the chances of becoming used to my dosage, but the idea of ever going back to my depression is terrifying for me. It definitely does help with binge eating disorders though. As a recovering anorexic, I have to be constantly mindful to eat enough. Keto has helped me trust my hunger cues though, and it’s also kept my energy levels and cravings manageable."

With whatever ingredients you have, really focus on caramelizing them well. Onions are the perfect crossroads of cheap and flavorful; cook them on low low low heat until they get DEEP color. If you can save up for butter or get it on sale, a little goes a long way for finishing the onions. Make a batch of this, and use it in your recipes to save cooking time. You could even make a big batch (start with 4 or 5 to try it out) and freeze it. A little knob of butter also goes a really long way when finishing pasta sauces (even canned/jarred). Also, PLEASE SALT WHILE YOU COOk. Tasting and seasoning often let’s the (dirt cheap) salt have a chance to deepen the flavor. This actually leads to using less salt overall, and will make you feel waaaay more satisfied with what you cook. Seasoning and browning really are the keys. Practice makes perfect! While you learn: hot sauce is a good band aid.

For those concerned about salt: the type of diet being recommended is going to be based in eating whole, unprocessed foods. It’s only when eating processed foods as your primary food that salt really becomes an issue. Of course, this is not regarding people who may reduce salt because of established medical issues."
