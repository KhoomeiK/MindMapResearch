amateur_boxing,fhezns1,t3_f2rwzn,1581533190.0,"Every person who has ever fought has had the thoughts you are having now. I know that doesn’t make you feel unique or special, but it’s the absolute truth. Call it a rite of passage, if you will.

Myself and those I know that have spent decade(s) training have come to realize the true benefit is growth. 

To feel so mediocre and inadequate at something, but then to crawl, scrape and learn your way to shaping and molding yourself into a something that you are proud of is why you should keep going. 

Your prize at the end of the road is the experience of what it’s like to overcome the obstacle of “not being good enough”. 

If you quit now, you will simply encounter a similar problem of inadequacy again later in life in a different context when you learn a new sport, or start a new career or hobby. If you quit now... especially if the reason is because it became too tough, you will only have the experience of quitting under your belt. We are creatures of habit. The more things you quit, the more of a quitter you become. 

Good luck. 🙏🏼"
