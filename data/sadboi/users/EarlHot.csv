The people of Flint were told that the water they were drinking was SAFE! We only know about this because a group of desperate residents went on am ardrous legal crusade to obtain proper information about the water they drank and bathed their kids with and which had become visibly contaminated. Do you understand the gross neglect that goes on when officials LIE about their failures to properly treat the unnecessarily diverted pipelines leading to the erosion in the pipes and the contamination, all he while attempting to defame the concerned citizens that brought it up? People in Flint shouldn't have trusted their government then and I don't blame them in the slightest for continuing to feel that way.
