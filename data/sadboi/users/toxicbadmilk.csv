I was just out of high school and barely had a part time job and they thought that was good enough for me to be on my own. I really wasn’t doing anything to be kicked out either, I spent all my time in my room and was extremely depressed. Anyways, I was so focused on trying to pay bills and be alive that I didn’t have time to deal with all of the things they did to me. I’m 21 now and just started counseling and am getting on medication soon. I thought I was doing well but it’s all finally catching up to me and it’s horrible. Working on it though."

The owner interviewed me, immidiately brought up religion (they were super Christian) and asked me if I was religious. I nicely said no and that flipped his switch. I figured I’d try to get past this because I really needed a job at the time. He goes on talking about how all his employees are so passionate about their work and he was asking me if I was passionate about cleaning. I told him I’m a very tidy person and blah blah blah, he then tells me that I’m not passionate enough for the job and starts bringing up personal stuff about my life. Like future plans and school and family. I was a 19F at the time and he was pretty old and at that point I was getting kind of scared. He started telling me that I needed to figure my life out before getting a job and I needed to go to school, all while raising his voice in an angry dad tone. He continues to say a bunch of shit tearing me down and I literally thought he was going to hurt me. I finally got the guts to tell him I had to go and he had the audacity to hand me a business card and told me to call him when I’m ready for a job."

AskReddit,eoeyjt5,t3_br6qnu,1558513515.0,"Got hired at a huge retirement home, hiring lady told me I would mainly be running around to all the rooms, see if people needed anything, help out in the kitchen, a little cleaning sometimes. Kind of an all around job that sounded fun to me. 

So this place has one main building which is apartments for people that aren’t really dead yet, just super old. Then there were 3 smaller buildings in the back that were hospice care, dementia issues, mental issues, just more close care buildings. 

 I start on my first day and they tell me that I am assigned to one of the hospice buildings. I was kind of confused but was just going with it. I soon find out that I was hired as an hna which is someone that does everything for the people that need help. So cleaning diapers, giving showers, hand feeding them food, and a bunch of other personal stuff. I let one of the managers know that I had no idea this was going to be my job and she just kind of blows it off. I then find out that I have to go take a college course for a couple weeks to be qualified to do all this stuff.

So here I am completely shocked at what my life is about to become and I’m debating just leaving but I stick it out. Also on a side note, the people training me literally wanted me to help change diapers and wipe ass on my first day. I was like yeah definitely not, I’m just going to watch for today. The thing that helped me decide my future was at dinner time when a lady threw up all over the table and the ladies working just told everyone to keep eating and I WAS LITERALLY INCHES AWAY FROM ALL THIS VOMIT AND WAS TOLD TO KEEP FEEDING THIS ONE LADY HER DINNER. 

So yeah after that I told them I wouldn’t be coming back. A couple other interesting things that happened that day were: 
- An old man who constantly jacked off under a blanket. I was warned he would try to sexually harass me when he was put to bed so I had to stay out of reaching distance if possible. 
-One lady had this robot cat that would meow constantly, in the 8 hours I was there the lady didn’t put it down once. She just pet it over and over while it meowed at her. It also had a sensor on it so when someone walked by it would meow and scare the hell out of you. 
-When the lady threw up at dinner her dentures popped out and it felt like I was in a movie. 
-One lady there was starving herself to death because her husband died and although her body was painfully deteriorating, her kids wouldn’t let her die peacefully because of their religion. Which I don’t know if that’s possible that kids can control their parents fate but that’s just what a worker told me."
