atheism,fr01v77,t3_glhwsx,1589781305.0,When I first started going blind I heard I'll pray for you from a lot of people and in every instance what it really meant was that they didn't want to help me or be around me but they felt the social pressure to appear like they cared and by offering to pray for me they hoped to appear helpful and concerned without actually doing anything at all. My advice is to ignore this kind of shallow fake and avoid them if you can

They need and demand a lot of attention. They are affectionate. They like to lick. Mine gets separation anxiety if she's left alone. She's really bothered by thunder and fireworks. They need to be groomed because they don't shed. She doesn't make much of a mess. They are an all around great dog."

Some of your suggestions I already do like having my wife go with me and trying to desensitize myself by, for instance, taking short walks around the block. It doesn't seem to really help. You are right about the probability of an adverse event being low. I actually give that advice to others after a mass shooting for example. I think your point about building on small reductions in my paranoia over time is great advice. It's just hard to do."
Blind,fkq1ew2,t1_fkq0w7y,1584426583.0,"My wife thinks the paranoia grew out of general anxiety from losing my vision coupled with the murder across the street from my house, the maniac who started shooting from his porch,  and the drive by shooting on my block. My therapist says it's from feeling like I don't have control of my life, and my psychiatrist just writes me a prescription. I was hoping that others have had this problem and that they might have some advice. Anyway, I do suffer from depression and anxiety, but only since I lost my vision."

I had to correct her by telling het that since I still have some sight left then Non 24 wasn't an issue for me. She wasn't aware that it only affected those who are completely blind. She specializes in mental health for the disabled by the way.
