Also when it comes to medical matters I find getting a professional opinion really helps to give me perspective. 

One technique I really like is to come up with the worst possible scenario, and then things that you can still do then. It seems counter intuitive to begin with but having something to hold on to helps (for me at least). For example when I was terrified of failing exams, I found a career I liked that I would be able to do without my exams"

With my current boyfriend we moved in the same circles but weren't close, so when we went on our second date (and I knew I liked him) I did a very clear ""I have PTSD, I'm working on it but it means that some things are difficult for me"". Luckily he had a vague idea, but I think that was enough.

When we started 'being intimate' we had another chat, this time a few minutes, tops (rather than the last one, which was less than a minute). This time it was more specific - relating to what happened to me and that I wanted to take sex etc slowly. I also gave him the option to ask questions if he wanted.

Now we've been dating for almost a year and it's pretty serious, and I feel comfortable with him knowing basically everything. He's still not been into a therapy session with me, but that's a goal that I'm working towards."

Imagine it like a earthquake - a small earthquake can still cause a lot of damage if the buildings aren't secure, of it there's a lot of small ones in quick succession. We don't just measure the severity of earthquakes by how powerful the shock was, but also in the way if affects life and the people who lived there.

For me there's no harm in talking to a medical professional, therapy is great even if you don't have a definitive diagnosis. My trauma therapy looks at all the small things that made me vulnerable to my ""biggest"" trauma. It's complicated because for me it wasn't one specific disaster and then everything changed, like a car crash, but low level abuse as a child which lead to me being vulnerable to an abusive relationship as a teen, which lead to me being more heavily affected by a friend's death as a young adult.
