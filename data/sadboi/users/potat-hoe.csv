Interstitialcystitis,fqhai7r,t3_giob6e,1589372562.0,Mine completely disappeared while I was pregnant. I found I could even eat chilli and huge trigger foods and had zero side effects. I had a 'normal' bladder for 9 months and it was bliss.

Definitely go and get it checked."
AnimalCrossing,fq5e5no,t3_ggpzoa,1589101932.0,"I dont like the fact there are tier lists. We could all make our own list as it's just down to personal opinion. I've seen different meme lists and they're all different. Who cares, have who you like on the island 🤷🏻‍♀️

I have Cube on my island and I love him dearly. Kevin has also grown on me as time has gone on, I generally dont like the sporty villagers.
I do have Julian as I randomly found him on a mystery island and he's ok. His house is beautiful though."
AnimalCrossing,fpz5rnu,t3_gfxhck,1589013943.0,"I haven't really planned much as I'm still quite new to the game series. Everytime I see a post or picture on here I see more items and recipes that I will get at some point which gives me ideas. So I'm waiting until further into the game.
I've made a residential area, orchard and flower breeding for now."
thesims,fpr5exw,t3_geqhkp,1588843040.0,So what the hell is the point in the expansion then?? I honestly cannot understand what they will be charging me £30 for. What new gameplay are they actually adding when ladders will be free 🙄🙄

Literally the best thing I've ever got in this game."

amputee,fnhtunm,t3_g1lpxn,1586968745.0,Id guess there is no time line given because everyone is different. One person will need them longer than others so they probably just play it by ear. Get your husband to talk to their doctor about coming off it.
thesims,fngv4aj,t3_g191tw,1586946103.0,I’ve seen this morning that apparently they’ve had a DDoS attack and that’s why the servers are down. They have no timescale on when it’ll be back online.

ptsd,fmsewp7,t3_fwqvkv,1586354020.0,"I have found this pandemic has been a huge help to my PTSD.
It’s like it’s forced my brain to reassess, so instead of having intruding thoughts and memories about the past and being scared of perceived threats - it’s given my brain a bit of a metaphorical kick up the arse.
Like there is now an actual threat, and steps I need to take to protect myself and my vulnerable husband. Even the fear of my abusers turning up also isn’t even scaring me, at the moment, because I have a different battle I’m dealing with. It’s like they have become nothing and don’t have a threat anymore because there’s something else now.
It’s also helping my brain to create a ‘wedge’ in my memory and timeline. Like that abuse was then and this is now as it still felt like I was in that time even though it was over a year  ago. I’m hoping it’ll help afterwards as it splits things into pre-COVID and post-COVID.

And don’t get me wrong I’m still having the occasional panic attack, and my OCD has come back with a vengeance, but that’s all a walk in the park compared to my PTSD symptoms.
I’m honestly terrified of it all coming back after this is over."

It’s been such a hard decision but by the looks of things they won’t be back during this school year. So we just can’t justify the amount we’d be paying, but also now be having to pay for him to be at home (extra food, supplies etc)."
ptsd,fjx9umn,t3_ff8j3s,1583663799.0,"I don’t believe any mental health problem ever truly goes away, not just PTSD. It lays dormant waiting for defences to fall - maybe a rough time at work, illness or something difficult happens in your life - and then it’ll return.
It’s all about managing it, making sure you know your routines and things that help you deal with it as it’s different for everyone.

And I say this from a place of having depression for over a decade, panic disorder, anxiety and OCD before having PTSD."
Interstitialcystitis,fjl7og4,t1_fjksuno,1583441514.0,"Next time he brings this up then ask him what it is that he wants from intimacy, as that way you can get a clear picture of what is going on and what he would like to feel more connected to you. What one person wants is different from another.
But also you can immediately pull him up on his ability to separate sex and intimacy if he says sex.

It’s hard, but a relationship with you can come with less sex compared to someone without bladder issues, as I’m sure it is for most of us on this subreddit. It’s for a partner to decide whether they’re happy to accept that as a part of being in a relationship with you. You shouldn’t be made to feel incomplete or like you’re somehow less than because of your body 💜"
Interstitialcystitis,fjkrfh9,t3_fdxxh6,1583432417.0,"Are you still spending any time together being intimate? So just cuddling, massages etc. Intimate doesn’t have to be sexual. And making date nights and still spending time together.
If those things are still happening then he needs to do some unpacking and work on his thoughts. It’s not your responsibility to reassure him all the time. You’ve explained multiple times what’s going on, that should be the end of it. If he is struggling with insecurities then HE has to work on that to stop it being an issue.
And it shows a lack of awareness for you and how you feel in all of this too. Is he also making effort to be intimate, without anything sexual? It doesn’t fall squarely on you."

Interstitialcystitis,ffo3ef2,t1_fd7ij1u,1580073677.0,"Sorry it’s taken me so long to reply.
I’ve had 3 urine samples sent off for cultures, they’ve all come back clear. I’m having one final one sent off and then my GP said she’ll send me for scans.

I began to have discharge and itching in my urethra which they believe was thrush and cleared up after thrush treatment. But the pain is still there 🙄

I will speak to my GP about being referred on. But with the NHS it may be having to have certain tests first."
Interstitialcystitis,ffo2b1k,t1_ffo0t59,1580073450.0,"Absolutely agree with this. Penetration is not the only way to have sex.
More focus on oral or using hands, even just intimate touching and having skin on skin snuggles. That way you are both enjoying a sensual experience as your pleasure and enjoyment is just as important too."
