Make sure you get a primer. 

When selecting foundation you need to decide if you want tint, light, medium, or full coverage. Start with a tint or light. Foundation needs to match the back of your hand/neck. You can apply it with your hands, flatbrush, or a beauty blender. 

You need a concealer too, try to get it to match your skin tone too. 

Then you can add blush, highlight, bronzer, and/or contour.

You can set the look with a spray or powder. Do a powder, it needs to match your skin tone.
