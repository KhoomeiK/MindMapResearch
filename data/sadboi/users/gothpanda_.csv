Anxiety,fcy0o5p,t3_eje70z,1578073116.0,"I absolutely deal with this too. Most recently at Starbucks with my mom and couldn‚Äôt decide what I wanted and it was insanely busy. Once I decided, they were out of what I had decided on, and because I was already frustrated and there was a huge line behind me, I got super anxious and made a snap decision. I totally sounded mad and probably rude to the girl working. My mom fortunately knows not to take it personally when this happens because it is only when I‚Äôm incredibly anxious. Doesn‚Äôt mean I like acting that way with her though. I try to be really mindful of myself and my actions when I notice an anxious episode coming on so that I don‚Äôt come off mean, but sometimes it comes on so quickly (like the Starbucks incident) I can‚Äôt help it."

I just didn‚Äôt feel like I belonged there. It‚Äôs hard for me to feel like I have a genuine, real connection with someone I am friends with. I can be friendly with people, but I‚Äôve truly only known two people my whole life who I could consider true friends. I suppose I prefer just one or two great friends."
