For me, I frequently get the ""you shouldn't need it"" from female doctors. Correct, in a perfect world I shouldn't. But this isn't a perfect world and even at my age my body doesn't work particularly well, something they're aware of, having access to my medical records and all.

The pain killers thing is a very real problem. I have a trapped nerve in my upper spine and, due to the NHS' decision to no longer prescribe opioids or other stronger pain medications to outpatients, I'm pretty much always in some degree of pain. They know this and won't provide the very easily accessible solution because a very small minority OD.

I never said ""evil wymenz"", I never insinuated that either. The ""unlike the male doctors of course"" tells me exactly what you think of men in this regard. I'm certainly not unbiased, but you're even farther away than I am from it.

It isn't fiction, there are plenty of stories from chronic pain sufferers about being completely left in the dark by their GPs in recent years.

No, viagra isn't necessary. Neither is birth control because sex in general isn't necessary. It's something people like to do, so do. Very little in this world is necessary, that doesn't mean you don't provide it."

I'm a fairly middle-of-the-road person and try not to attribute malice to anything or anyone without evidence to the fact, and I find it troubling that an increasing number of people just see the ""other side"" as evil.

What I've said is true, I've provided you the science as to why hormonal birth control has limited use medicinally, and provided annecdotal context as to something similar happening on a much smaller scale in the UK.

I've never said these are equal problems, I've never said one makes the other acceptable, I've never said the problem in my case is ""women bad"", all I did was say that the problems are not inheritly due to men being bad.

I have no said that limiting access to birth control for a nation is a good thing, in fact I said it was not. I'm guessing you glossed over that bit.

I'm saying that people who have no personal experience with a problem often don't realise the importance for alleviation of said problem, take pain medication for example. It's almost impossible to get any effective relief in the UK now unless you're dying, simply because most doctors have no idea what chronic pain is like.

Same thing with the importance of birth control, the majority of men don't understand the importance. The less experience you have with a problem, the less likely you are to understand the importance of solving it.

However, I do have a lot of guilt over times I've tried to, and it's gone wrong.

Please don't refer to this as a first-world problem, it's so reductive and emotion and the need to be loved and understood is such an important part of life, you shouldn't feel selfish or shallow for wanting that.

I am glad you have found someone you feel you can be honest with without judgement, it's not easy to put up with us as I'm sure you are aware. I hold the belief that only people who have experience with a topic can truly understand, put up with, and support another with it, so that's good for you.

I am a little concerned you are taking this very quickly. Some relationships run very intensely and burn out quickly, hopefully that isn't what's happening here.

My best (only remaining) friend is engaged to a girl who basically moved in with him after a month of dating, and they seem very happy, so it can work out.

I would suggest setting up video calls if you haven't already just in case WA does get locked down though, always best to have these things in place, just make sure you've agreed on times to call so you don't start to feel like you're bothering her.

I completely get the "" wasting chunks of people's lives "" thing, I hold the same mentality towards long-term dating, but it is important to not rush into something, too.

From my experience, you tend to find those who have had harder lives tend to do 1 of 2 things in relationships:

1. Emotionally distance themselves to prevent further pain
2. Dive headfirst in

There's a good middleground in there which is the best road to take, I'm permanently stuck in position 1 in that respect unfortunately.

If you really do feel like you have met your perfect person, I suggest doing something I do when manic, write every thought down, every one, then wait until you come down back to baseline or even in a drop, then read it all back to yourself and see which bits you still agree with, that should help you filter out which bits are you, and which bits are mania.
