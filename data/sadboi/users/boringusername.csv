She was trying to put a canuler ( thing for drips ) in my hand while I was have really strong contractions and blood ended up spraying all over the place it was a catalogue of errors and when my baby was born I tore ( 3rd degree) and had to go to theatre for a long time to me sown up.

My take away from the two births is just how much the quality of care can effect what happens the hospital I was at the first time ended up on the news over neglect of mothers and baby’s.

Anxiety,fb5j7di,t1_fb4pdb8,1576528634.0,I find present shopping a nightmare. I overthink it so much that no matter what I get I won’t think it is good enough so tend to just get more then I way over spend. Do you know anything like sweets or something they like you could get gift card and a treat makes it more personal

AskReddit,fa8qa20,t3_e7uc9f,1575852134.0,My 3 year old asked Santa for a walking remotcontrol eyeball! And clarified a toy one not a real one
Parenting,f9thsy5,t3_e6tkt7,1575624991.0,I think they just don’t like being alone really my 3 year old says stuff like that but all you can do is show them everything is safe and ok. What often works with mine is she asks me to stay for 3 minutes and I give her a reason I have to go after like I need to eat dinner and promise to check on her when I have had my dinner dosnt always work especially if she isn’t well but often does

toddlers,f95z8gv,t3_e3zntb,1575137485.0,"Do you still have a baby bath? One of mine went though a terrified of the bath phase she would sit in the baby bath ( she was way to big for it) so we did that and played in the bath with no water then baby bath in big bath  then water in both just really building up to a proper bath again. At 8 she still hates water in her face, but it didn’t take too long to get her back in the bath
Oh and I got this silly face shield thing from amazon so her face didn’t get wet when washing hair"
toddlers,f95y150,t3_e3udsq,1575137000.0,It can be embarrassing like when my older one was about 3 she fell off a bouncy castle and landed weirdly with her foot underneath her and was screaming about hurting her vagina. My littlest is 3 now and loves to mention hers or anyone else’s I have tried to explain the outer bit isn’t the vagina but every time we are in the loo together she says I can see your vagina. She has also noticed at swimming boys have penises I try just to not make a big deal like if she mentioned someone’s nose I would but I think in the long run it is better to use proper words and try to egnore our embarrassment
Parenting,f8uqce5,t1_f8ubmvo,1574839137.0,Likely he is but it can take a while until they can make it without the second nap.
Parenting,f8tdv30,t3_e1rfxi,1574801325.0,"I think it is a phase a lot of them go though you have 3 choices 

1. Let them have the late nap then stay up late

2.  Do anything you can to keep them awake even if it means letting them watch tv! 

3. Tire them out with getting active right after the first nap then do whatever it takes to get them to sleep earlyer eg drives in the car

Or any combination and hope they grow out of it soon"
Parenting,f8pjxcf,t3_e1iug5,1574702722.0,Maybe ask for combined gifts like a playhouse or trampoline from a few people and set a spending limit? But it is hard they want things and everyone wants to buy them gifts to open too many soft toys and and lots of plastic seems to happen.

WeightLossAdvice,f8ch6ey,t1_f8cfrnr,1574460145.0,As I’m so short 130 isn’t great on me. Basically my husband told me he doesn’t like the weight I have put on and now I’m a bit obsessed with getting slimmer I need to lose at least another 13 pounds. Maybe I do need to tell the doctor how much of an issue the weight gain is but I’m not sure they would care
WeightLossAdvice,f8cehwa,t1_f8ccl7o,1574458542.0,Takeing proxiten (not sure if that is the spelling) Unfortunately we don’t really get psychiatrists just gps they don’t want to change it as it takes a while transition to a new one
Anxiety,f7v6fpw,t3_dxnmce,1574021063.0,I wear a really strong deodorant and antiperspirant and that helps me not worry too much I do worry it might not be good for me.
