BipolarReddit,fkdbd9g,t3_ffy1lw,1584073307.0,"So this happened to me a few years ago, unfortunately on top of bp2, I have trouble forming connections/trusting people, as well as lowering anything that remotely resembles a wall. So when J told me that we had 3 weeks left, I felt betrayed frankly. We were in a very similar situation. I wish I could say it turned out for the best, but honestly I've never been one for long goodbyes. I simply thanked her for the help that she gave me over the year we worked together and didn't schedule any further appointments.

 I tried a few others but during the 'interview' where they ask me about my history I tend to also mention this story, and ask '...do you believe that you will be here long enough to help me with X?' Currently my therapist is lovely and just bought a house with her fiance in town... So I think we're safe for now. ;) 

I hope this atleast eases your stress or made you smile. Good luck!"

AskMen,eywa8vu,t1_eyvxfqa,1567524706.0,"Yeah, it's something that we pick up pretty quickly. I know I tend to over protect in those environments personally, but I would much rather make sure everyone gets home safe than not. Everytime I would go out with friends in college, it wasn't unspoken, we had verbal and physical cues for 'get me out/away'."
