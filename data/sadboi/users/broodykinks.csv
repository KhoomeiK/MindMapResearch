religion,fq88tp8,t3_gh8qmg,1589160830.0,I have always wondered about the same. Maybe it's because  of how our language is literally patriarch or maybe it's because religions are created by patriarchy.

I don't know if I have been wrong in my speech but if you go through the comment section, you will see how transphobic comments have got many upvotes and comments calling out transphobia, however kind they may be, have got downvotes"
TrueOffMyChest,fq3gs1h,t1_fq3cskv,1589066290.0,"What you have to understand here is that trans people are having 'distress' over their body because of the mismatch between their assigned sex in genitals and gender in brain. And the only thing we can do to eliminate the distress is by gender affirmation surgery. As they require such kind of treatment, 'gender dysphoria' is put in that list... Not because it is purely pathological...... The mismatch is REAL and not delusional."
