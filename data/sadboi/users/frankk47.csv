Tasted like complete shit of course. They took about 30-40 min to start kicking in. It was the craziest body high i ever had. I was just sinking into the couch. Me and my GF tried to have sex, took our clothes off and just laughed at each other. It was fun but weird.

I have taken LSD probably 30ish times since then and my girlfriend has probably taken it a dozen times.

We talked to our landlord. Found someone to take over our lease. Moved out ASAP. We found someone on Facebook renting out a room in their house. We worked out a month to month agreement.
