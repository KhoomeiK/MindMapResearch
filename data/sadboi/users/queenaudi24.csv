Cooking,fc3pgaz,t3_efzdrg,1577395352.0,"I know macaroni and cheese is a basic item, however, I had never made a large batch or a non-boxed mac.

I followed a friend's recipe and substituted condensed milk for extra regular milk. Then, added about  a dollop of a homemade cream cheese powdered sugar icing. Good stuff.

Edit: NO condensed milk was used. Hence, the icing."

But from the actual rolled piece or piece piece, I have no idea how to contain that smoke.

Theres also devices made for exhaling similar to vapes, but $$$
