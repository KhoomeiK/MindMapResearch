I did a presentation on bias in IQ tests. Ie cultural/linguistic bias. The format of the tests. The fact some people have shorter attention spans or can't focus for prolonged periods. The fact some people don't do well in exam conditions, written tests or are abstract thinkers etc etc. 

Not to mention people can literally learn the format of the tests and ""study"" for them, so they'd score higher than someone who didn't. 

It's an outdated and inaccurate measure of intelligence"
depression,f3z2p27,t3_diu8qq,1571262153.0,"I tried to kill myself at 18 too. My birthday actually.

When I woke up in a hospital bed, I cried because I realised i'd failed. 

Looking back now, I'm glad I was unsuccessful. I have 4 children, I've made a life for myself. I struggle some days. But so much life has happened between now and 18 and it's been worth sticking around for.

A bad reference from an employer isnt the be all and end all. I promise you. Especially when you're young. A lot of employers will overlook it. Maybe do a couple of months of voluntary work or help out with a charity in between while you're looking for a job and get a reference from there. You can always explain to employers that you had some personal issues, you've  taken  time  out  and you've since resolved them.

Is there a relative you could stay with until you get back on your feet? A parent maybe? 

You're going to get through this and be stronger for it. ðŸ’“"

raisedbynarcissists,f3yw2sm,t1_f3x5nu1,1571260203.0,"My initial thoughts reading this were ""wow. My nMom would never admit any wrongdoing on her part."" If anything, she'd gaslight the f**k out of any attempt to get her to take accountability and id somehow wind up apologising and never quite be sure how it happened.

I went thought most of my late teens and early 20's questioning my sanity and wondering if I'd imagined my entire childhood. It was only when she started twisting things that happened in adulthood that I realised I was probably right about my early memories too."

I'm under a psychiatrist for anxiety who regularly orders full bloodwork because she acknowledges that deficiencies can play a role in anxiety and depression."

It is driving a wedge between us tbh."
raisedbynarcissists,f2ae2wo,t3_dcnunc,1570112183.0,"My mother was awful in this sense. She wouldn't let me see my dad and would constantly do my head in with horifiic stories no child should have to hear. Since I was extremely young too. I remember being really traumatised by things she would tell me about my father when I was as young as 4 years old.

She would tell me how vindictive and cruel he was. How violent he was. How he had tried to abuse me etc etc. To the extent that I was so terrified of him, I had a full blown panic attack at the age of 7 when we ran into him at a local funfair (we lived in a very small community). 

I still to this day don't know how much of her stories were true. 

But I think this was more brainwashing than offloading. Because she wanted to ensure I never wanted to see my father so she could better isolate and control me as I grew into my teens. 

She did use me to offload in other ways too. I think I thought this was normal. It was all I knew. 

As a teen and adult, I was always the one everyone leaned on for support and I never seemed to be aware of the emotional pr psychological impact it was having on me because I was used to it.

 It wasn't until the past few years when a friend pointed out I was taking on everyone else's problems and making my own life more difficult that I realised I had a choice."
