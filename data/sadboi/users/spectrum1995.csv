I have known gradients for some time now and the stars I quite laboriously duplicated and scattered them randomly. I don't know why a tutorial is even needed for that. The tracing bitmap feature for a vector silhouette in Inkscape is definitely a thing I learned.

For your second paragraph, I welcome your advice and will work on it suitably. However, I am not sure if you have read the lyrics to the song Spies by Coldplay. I have explained my design in one of the other comments, in relation to the actual lyrics and the current pandemic situation. The objective was that if you read the lyrics, the design kind of starts to reveal itself.

Thank you for stopping by. I will keep your suggestions in mind for my future designs. Have a nice day! :)"
Inkscape,fqw7u1t,t1_fqvr9dt,1589695355.0,"Hey, I'm happy you asked this question and I shall try to answer it the way I picture it.

If you notice the lyrics of Spies, you will see that it is extremely relevant in today's times of the coronavirus pandemic. My design is an attempt to illustrate that. The stars here are the spies which represent the coronavirus. And notice that it is a night sky (ominous). The person is falling represents the dread, the calamity, the fear, the panic and the death. And he is surrounded everywhere by the spies and ""you can't touch them, no 'cause they're all spies"". The virus cannot be seen and is untouchable. But then comes the last part. ""And if we don't hide here, they're gonna find us"", that represents the need for social distancing and consciously staying safe. The only way right now to be safe is to ""hide in here"". Hence, the man is shown alone (socially distant) and if you notice, there's an orange glow at the bottom which represents positivity and health, upon which he is falling symbolising that social distancing will cause some economic and other losses, but you will fall to safety only. And of course, the stars or spies ""can't touch you, no 'cause they're just spies"". The virus cannot touch you by itself, it is us who are being its carriers.

I haven't managed to write this very coherently as I am in some hurry right now. But once you read the lyrics, the lines start revealing themselves. I posted this on my Instagram too, with the lyrics to the song in the caption.

Okay, so I looked at the original album art after I had designed mine. I just knew the name of the album, that's it. My idea is that the man is walking down the road regardless of whatever happens. He's just going ""wherever"" it takes him.

The filter texture hasn't come good, I agree. It was looking much better on a PC, though. The idea here was to make it appear that the water is running onto the road, suggesting that the road is slippery and not very favorable to walk on. But the guy is determined to make it to the greens that are at the far end.

It has been just over a week now that I have begun learning Inkscape, so there are a 100 things that an expert can do to this design itself to make it look more convincing of my idea. My execution is pretty average, but I think I like my idea.

Now that you know my idea, would you be able to suggest ways that I can polish this?

puzzles,fp8w5n1,t3_gbs566,1588405085.0,"Discussion:

Okay, I solved it a bit differently. So if a rectangle has as many cells as the number that it contains, it basically means that the area of the rectangle is equal to the number within the rectangle (if each small square is considered of unit area). Once we observe this, the very possible dimensions of the rectangles become very few in number and we can easily proceed via elimination.

For instance, I started with the number 9 in the third row from the bottom. It could not have come as a 1×9 or a 9×1 rectangle (1×9 arrangement is possible but it leads to a quick contradiction for the 6 in the same row at the end). Hence, 9 can only be captured in a 3×3 square. Even here, there are just a handful of possibilities, and the correct one is easily found out by easy contradictions and elimination.

This technique is especially helpful if the number is a prime. Because then, a possible rectangle around it can only either be a horizontal or a vertical one, leaving only two options to check. The puzzle will become hard if there are numbers with several factors.

I liked it. Thank you for this. :)"
