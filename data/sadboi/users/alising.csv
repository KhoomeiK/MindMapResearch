It was so painful and started up immediately as a dry cough that was the worst I've ever had and felt like razor blades in my chest. Now I know realistically it's very unlikely, more or less impossible, to have been covid really, because we live in a tiny town and we don't travel often, so there's very little chance of us having picked it up from anywhere.

Fuck no, I think that was real. Oh shit please let that have been a dream. Nope,definitely happened"" ""i spent all my money."" ""I threw up in front of everyone at the bar.

I've had 3 people irl when I have brought the names up say that they never made the connection until I said it and two more say nobody would care anyway.

I'm very pregnant and the fact someone said I was a troll the first time made me very upset, I guess it's the hormones, because I honestly was looking to see if it was just me making the association because pretty much everyone I mentioned it to irl had the above responses.

Our meals generally consist of things like veggie sausage/burger, new potatoes and vegetables - baked potatoes and beans - shepherds pie - pasta and sauce - things like chicken curries or chilli etc that use quorn or similar in place of meat. Nothing particularly exciting and I'm not sure we would benefit from one.

I've been googling to find slow cooker or IP recipes we will eat that will involve less time or conversely with a SC more time but less babysitting, as I'm having a baby soon and want easy no fuss healthy meals.

A similar set up with the house too, although it was my grandmother who passed away leaving my grandfather eith severe dementia behind. I admit that it wasn't actually me who dealt with the main affairs, but what happened was:

Grandfather was found a suitable care home. Initially this was quite simple as he lived on a retirement complex with attached home and once my grandma was in hospital started wandering around the complex in a state of undress. So initially he went there, then he went to a more suitable home for his needs (well, he's now in his third home in 12 months, but this one seems to suit his needs perfectly). 

The house - it was full of crap and quite dirty as my grandparents were very proud and we had no idea they were clearly struggling with basic household maintenance. My parents and I, plus my partner, spent days trawling through their stuff to locate wills and other important documents, and to make sure we had all we wanted from there, like mementoes and photos. Once that was done, we called in house clearance to empty and clean the place. If you can't afford that, it's going to be a lot more time consuming for you but you can do it yourself! 

The legal side - not going to lie, this bit wasn't my area of expertise but we got solicitors to tidy everything up legally and execute the will. There wasn't anything to be given to anyone so it wasn't too difficult. The house was then put on the market"

Do I think she is a useless loser and laugh at how dumb she is when I remember it? Do I remember it all the time and talk to other people about it?

Also, I mentioned this in a different post recently, but I did something that embarassed me so much while drunk that I genuinely remembered it at least once a day, daily, for about 7 years.

It was 9 years ago and it's honestly only been in the past year that I've been able to remember it without that hot feeling of shame spreading over me and also only in the last year that I only remember it by remembering it, instead of it presenting itself to me, you know? Anyway, the point is, I was out with some girls I've been friends with forever and one of them asked what the most embarassing thing we have ever done while drunk is. Then we decided it would be more fun to guess the others', since we have known each other for so long. I started cringing, knowing exactly what story was coming up. Actually, neither of the two girls who had been there on that night guessed that as my most embarassing thing. It's like they genuinely couldn't remember it, and they weren't just sparing me the cringe, they would have said if they thought that was it. I just agreed that yes, whatever they said was the most embarassing thing as I wasn't going to bring up the other incident!!!

I know it's not a very modern view, and I am 1 million % for both parents doing whatever they want, but for me, personally, I feel like society does suffer with parents having to work so many hours instead of being able to be home, taking care of their kids. Again, this is said as a parent who works full time so my child is at school all day (although luckily for me, since she started school she has been cared for in the wraparound hours by family members, but I still think it would be better if it was me) so not judging those who do it, at all"

AskReddit,fetrk3h,t3_eqf2xd,1579378991.0,"I get it on and off and have done for about 15 years now. It's always accompanied by a nightmare, usually one where there is someone/something 'after' me and its going to kill me. It's getting closer and closer to me, I'm getting anxious and panicky and it's around now that I realise it's sleep paralysis. I know that it's not real, but I feel like it is still. I usually become aware of my partner laying in bed next to me at this stage and try screaming, because if I can wake him up I know I will wake up properly and it will stop. But my scream doesn't come out, it's like my throat is closed so I can only make tiny squeaking noises. It also feels like I have something heavy on my chest. I will try to kick/shove my fiance to wake him up and usually this will wake me up, although it never wakes him so I'm not sure if I actually do scream or kick him, although it definitely feels like I do it for real. 

Only, sometimes, when this happens I am actually only dreaming that I'm waking up, so I think I'm actually awake and will tell my fiance about the bad dream I have but then I realise the thing is *still* after me. Then I'm terrified, cos I'm awake now right? and it's still after me. I'm panicking and trying to get away but I can't move, then I can't scream and I realise it's still sleep paralysis and I'm not awake, but I still can't wake up. I think I had this happen 5 times in a row once, when I finally woke up I was so drained and felt totally out of sorts. 

I never see what's after me, I just have a horrible feeling in my dream and know something is trying to hurt me. My most memorable one was one of the first, when I dreamt I was hiding under my bed and something was coming up the stairs, and I really needed to scream to wake the rest of the house up to help me but no sound would come out and I had the panicky, heavy feeling in my chest. 

Sleep paralysis really sucks, I get it the worst when I'm stressed. Luckily things are going pretty well recently so it's been a while since I had to deal with it."

It was weird af tbh, he cane back really religious. Looking back now though, i do wonder if he was ribbing us a bit, and it was part of his act. He was a bit....eccentric"
AskReddit,fap6tau,t3_eaa9j0,1576281316.0,"I didn't enjoy secondary school. I was bullied and went to a not great school, I was pretty smart but ended up not paying any attention as I got in with a bad crowd, so instead of getting all A's like I was predicted, I barely scraped some B's and C's - not awful, but I could have done better (and evidently not that smart, or I wouldn't have got in with the wrong crowd!). I left school 17 years ago and still have some esteem problems from the bullying. 

Having said that, I went to a college at 16 in a different town which was much more fun and I made new friends but ultimately dropped out as the subjects just weren't me. Went back to college and uni aged 25 and loved it, met good people, had great fun, got a degree. 

So all in all, education itself wss a mixed bag but I really didn't like school. My daughter starts secondary school next year and I'm very nervous, of her getting in the wrong crowd,being bullied...having the sameexperience as me, basically!"

AskReddit,fa74kk7,t1_fa5yhgs,1575831306.0,"I've had IVF and there are rules at every clinic I looked into. If I had been eligible for NHS funding, it would have been 12 st 8, or 176 lbs. As I wasn't and I paid privately, they raise it but still nobody would offer IVF if I was over a bmi of 35 which would be 14 st 9lbs, or 205lbs. They're definitely more strict on weight, but I think the higher one is still too high to be honest, you're at a higher risk for so much if your starting weight is higher. With that said and knowing the difficulty mentally of going through infertility, why anyone would do all that when there's a higher risk of losing the baby, one way or another, I don't know"
