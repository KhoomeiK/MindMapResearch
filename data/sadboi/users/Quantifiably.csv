CasualConversation,fectrgg,t1_fecsx56,1578984289.0,"(depending on your brokerage, you may have to ask them what you have to put on your page/ads like your MLS number or the equal housing opportunity thing, so first thing is tell them you’re gonna start doing your own digital marketing and you need to know their policies on it)

I still believe your best bet is Facebook to digitally advertise on. Go ahead and create a business page. Get a good headshot from a good photographer and throw it on there. Make the page name like this: Your name - Keller Williams Realty, or better, Your name - Realtor.

After that, you can go ahead and start posting useful content that people can use for their benefit. Video with you in it has the best engagement and reach IMO. Post things like videos of staging tips, market evaluations, etc. try to make it interesting and mot just staring at the camera reading off a piece of paper. 

You probably want to advertise, so head on over to business(dot)facebook(dot)com. Facebook Business Manager  is a beast and has a lot of shit and it can and will confuse you. Its also broken as fuck, or at least it was when i last used it 3-4 months ago, and Facebook has a LOT more to worry about then their business manager. Id look up a recent video just walking through the layout and what everything is.

For ads themselves, you want to do LEAD ADS. This allows the user to click on the ad and input their info (you want to use only name phone # and email, its the best). id recommend doing what we call homes lists. Basically, the ad will have a headline saying:

❗️ATTENTION (your area): FREE LIST OF HOMES UNDER (Median market price minus a few thousand)❗️

That gets their attention and the cheap price will will make them click. 

Im starting to realize theres a bunch more stuff that i have to explain and its 2AM and i have class tomorrow, so im gonna set an alarm and a !RemindMe tomorrow afternoon and finish this. ill go more into detail about the ad copy and lead ads and how you should follow up with the leads."
