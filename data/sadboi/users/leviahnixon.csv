depression,evzg6z3,t3_clqg9m,1564956812.0,Yes I feel you because people ask me why I read so much and the truth is. Is because I love being in someone else’s world. And out of reality and when that stuff isn’t there it sucks.
depression,evzfyvv,t3_clzejo,1564956649.0,Yep I definitely feel you on this one. And it sucks sometimes because people will truly thing you like them but it’s not them it’s the attention that they give you. And it ducks because you know that you alone.
depression,evzfsh7,t3_clue8y,1564956523.0,It will be proven wrong because it’s only just a meter of time before things turn around for you. It won’t always be this way.

depression,evjow6w,t1_evi2lob,1564566847.0,Omg same it’s like no one gets it. You parent are either saying it’s. Phase it your being dramatic. And it’s like your not but they don’t get it.
depression,evjdybc,t3_cjo7ts,1564560564.0,That’s the realist shit I ever heard.  And sometimes people pull the guilt trip on you. And they make you feel as though it’s your fault. Your doing something to cause your sadness. No everyone is your friend either. Not all are out the help you. Your just a charity case.
depression,evem3pm,t1_evel3fo,1564471084.0,Good luck to you. Your gonna be okay just remember it’s in your head.
depression,evekoob,t1_eveklk6,1564469743.0,See we don’t know that. You are not pathetic. No one thinks that but you. That’s the devil tellin you that and you know that.
depression,evekgz5,t1_evek8v9,1564469543.0,And sometimes that the hardest part. Look at yourself in the mirror and move on in life shit happens that’s what makes us human. You gotta fess up to stuff. Even if you have a chemical imbalance that’s not gonna make you pathetic or no more human than you are now.  Take the meds or whatever and start living your life for you.
depression,evek358,t1_evek0iu,1564469188.0,But none of that is you. It’s what you went through but it’s not you.
euphoria,evejvtv,t3_cj40sm,1564468999.0,Team fez man Nate was all wrong. I still ship Nate and Jules for some odd reason.
depression,evejpx5,t1_evejnus,1564468845.0,What is your biggest problem?
depression,evejixw,t1_evejh8a,1564468667.0,Why? How will that make anything better?
depression,evej98s,t1_evej5de,1564468420.0,Sadness doesn’t have a target. It attacks anyone no matter the background yes I’ve had it worse in life. But your missing something that why your feeling this way. That’s the only thing I can think of. You have no reason to be sad but yet your battling with depression.
depression,eveiwp8,t1_eveipty,1564468101.0,Growing up I’ve never had the attention and affection that I needed and I admit it does weigh on you. I’ve watched my other get dragged and beaten in front of me.  I’ve watched her shoot yo drugs and ive had days where I didn’t eat. Because mom wanted drugs instead of a child. But I made it through and sometimes it’s hard and I tell you no lie it’s part of the reason why I’m depressed but I’m working on it.
depression,eveiqng,t1_eveipif,1564467945.0,You are never alone Remember that.
depression,evein33,t3_cjkjcz,1564467855.0,Neither will make you feel better because is it going to make you happy? Is it going to make the pain go away? How will it help you? It won’t it will make it worse and I get it you feel like your suffering and there’s no way out. I get it I really do. But there are other ways.

depression,eveii5v,t1_evegfue,1564467734.0,Wow never knew that.
depression,eveifq7,t3_cjeqbw,1564467676.0,Yes this is sexual assault and no of this is your fault and it’s easy to think that but it’s not. You are worth more than what he tried to do and society will blame you and tell you that it is your fault and that you asked for it. But you did not ask for anything. It’s not your fault he’s a pig and will get what is coming for him. Babygirl you are not alone it’s common to us when things like this happens and it’s sad. I’m sorry.
depression,evei6j6,t1_evei0cd,1564467465.0,Why do you feel that way? Is it because society had a certain standard that you do not meet? Or is it your outlook on society? Who cares what others think you are you. And no one can ever get a chance to be you. You may not have it all but you have more than what most people have. Your are worth more than what you say you are.
depression,evehvqq,t3_cjk8c5,1564467203.0,Yes. But if you need some I’m here.

depression,evecoyg,t3_cjkeng,1564462734.0,I don’t think you should do it. You have a life ahead of you. And I know what your thinking right. “ they don’t understand “ or “they don’t know what it’s like” but we do that’s why we’re all here. We all feel this way. But it’s not worth it.
depression,evecdcz,t3_cjml6m,1564462405.0,I hope that I will get better. The words aren’t there but the tears are.
depression,evec2to,t3_cjkwzv,1564462114.0,Let it all out. You can’t keep it in.

depression,evebcye,t1_evebac5,1564461407.0,No that’s great man. It’s just growing up in religious family they don’t allow you to medicate yourself.  They just throw the Bible at you. And it’s hard.
depression,eveb7n0,t3_cjlxov,1564461262.0,I’m sorry if you want an ear I’m here.
depression,eveayx5,t3_cjme2o,1564461029.0,Yes everyday and some days are bad. And it’s like no one is here.
depression,eveankk,t3_cjisun,1564460727.0,You know the sad thing is that you will always feel this way until you find out how to cope with it. It’s not about them. Your trying to make them happy. What about your happiness what makes you happy? What is something that you enjoy?
