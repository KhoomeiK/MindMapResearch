We say in DS9 that the Obsidian Orderâ€™s influence waned and waxed depending on the political situation on Cardassia. So we can probably assume something similar here with the Tal Shias and by extension the Zhat Vash. Theyâ€™re always active. But depending on the politics of the empire, they are either well resourced or poorly. We can assume they didnâ€™t have much pull for quite some time. The major change may have been with Shinzonâ€™s coup, which lead to a power vacuum that the Zhat Vash could exploit, giving them the resources and influence to engineer the destruction of Utopia Planetia."

Also, if you want kids to wait until puberty or older to figure out if they are gay or trans. Maybe we should also wait until then to determine if they are straight or cis.

And just to be pedantic, sexuality is orientation and degree of sexual attraction ranging from homo to hetero and allo to ace.
