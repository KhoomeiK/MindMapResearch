I get it, My parents didnt really prepare me for the shit show of life. 

Push through it, Have faith that you will find the solution. and in 8 years from now when you're pushing 30, You'll look back at this and be grateful you overcame it, You may even have a whole nother set of problems at that time too! 

Life is fucking hard, and it takes a lot of money to get it right, you're lucky you have an allowance, and get 1k from your parents. Do what you can to keep that relationship safe, And find the ways your money can work for you. Fuck the handbags, Sell the MERCEDEZ!! Get a Honda- Sell the handbags- If you need to eat and shelter yourself, Those things don't matter- Biuld yourself a platform, save money, anything, so that you can rely solely on YOURSELF- You can't Lift the world above your head if you aren't strong enough.
