Brunei,f80tmke,t1_f80sgle,1574137989.0,"Here's how.. Brunei is in dire need to solve it's high unemployment rate (common knowledge). To do that, they let almost anyone come in to invest in our country at a small price. Hengyi is no exception to this. 

When Hengyi comes in and builds all that infrastructure (and they can as they have the money and resources to do so), they have a level of expectations from Bruneian side. Cannot be China do all that and Brunei don't contribute anything right? So as agreement with Brunei government, China will hire Bruneians to fill in 50% of their workforce. Now China has done that, they started to see how some of the locals they hired do not meet their basic standards. What more I believe Hengyi is supposed to train local staffs also - at their expenses. So why should they agree to hire a sub-par local who is in to makan gaji buta saja, probably didn't pick up on training as fast when they can hire a foreigner for the same salary that can do a better job? 

Here is what's dangerous. We bought ourselves into letting China develop PMB. I believe it's quite a large sum to build Hengyi and develop the area. If we piss off China and Hengyi, and cannot pay back the debts to China.. China can easily ""buy over Hengyi"" like how they did with some ports of developments they have in other parts of the world. As much as I like China developing in Brunei and help solve some of that unemployment problems, I also fear for Brunei's future, given how locals have a bad repo for having an entitled approach to almost everything."
