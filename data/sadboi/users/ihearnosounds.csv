BPD,fopg6xh,t3_g8jvs5,1587960657.0,"OP, thank you for writing this. This stigma is based in fear and ignorance. I would also like to speak out as a husband of an amazing woman with BPD in treatment. This culture based on stereotypes is draconic and disgusting. It is also particularly debilitating to a target group prone to validation issues inherently. To all those out there struggling, it may seem like there is a front of enemies at the gate but try your best to carry on and help yourselves through treatment. It is understandably difficult enough to face this stigma every day let alone BPD itself. There are just as many people willing to help and love through understanding as there are willing to perpetuate ignorance, stay strong we‚Äôre with you. Be well."
