If I am not able to convince myself that I am worthy, how can others will valuate me?

The thing is that if I am that shity as my fucked up mind is constantly telling me then what will I lose by pretending that I am good enough ?

The answer is nothing. Because think of like like this way:  Even if I am faking it just to pass my day, to enjoy my meal, to hangout with friends or to be peace with myself, until I get my shit fixed, then it's winning.

Maybe everyone out there are feeling just as shity as myself or worse but they are pretending to be cool. 

The bottom line is that you don't have to be so conscious about your feelings 24/7; I am not telling you to ignore them; but man, you have to shut the fuck out of them when they are fucking annoying. 

The harsh truth my friend about adulthood is that you should figure it out by yourself. No one really knows what's the ultimate way of living nor how you should conduct your life. You should take the responsibility of your feelings, as Pr Jordan Peterson said, get a routine and then look around and try to fix yourself piece by piece. Life will not wait you while you're sitting right there trying to figure out how to solve your puzzle.

Morocco,f6nbhy1,t3_ds231y,1572988102.0,"Hi, 

Resident Moroccan but I am not from the cities you mentioned. I will try to answer as much as I can:

1- if you're planning on traveling between many cities and you have driving license, I recommend that you rent a car. It's relatively cheap (ex 30€ per day for a Dacia ) and it's gives more freedom to go wherever you want. 
Otherwise, buses in Marrakech are good and you can take caravane for a tour, it's not the case for fes, for security issues take the taxi. Chefchaouen is rather a small village so basically you can get around just by walking.

2- it depends on how you want to experience this travel. So if you're into knowing locals and living their way of life you should rent a part of house from a local family. They can arrange to cook for you traditional Moroccan dishes and they can be very useful in guiding you toward best places to visit in the city. You can use a website (avito.com) to know the price and contact people ( maybe you'll find some middle men but you can judge by the mean price ). 
The other option is motels and hotels, that depends on your budget. The prices generally start from 10€ and rises for 4 stars and above it's best to book earlier to get the best price.

3-well, when it comes to food, you came to the best place. Dishes in Morocco are very variable. Basically, every dish that has meat could be prepared without it. For instant, Tajine could be made just with vegetables. We eat all sort of beans and soups. Restaurants has plenty of salads options and there is Moroccan one called Salad Marocaine. You can always mention that you don't want fish nor meat in your plate and your good.
Other than that, sweet are the best here you love them.
Feel free to pm if you have questions
Enjoy your travel"

Although I can't say that I can 100% understand what's going on inside you, everyone's feelings are unique, but I can confirm to you that your not alone in this situation. 

For instance, I want you to think about this idea, and just give it a try :

You've been happy one day, that for sure. Maybe yesterday, last week or last year. It's still in your mind as memory. Maybe you can recall it, maybe not, but what is important is that you knewn happiness ounce and you can absolutely feel it again. 

That's been said, not feeling ok will not last forever, the same goes for feeling good, it don't last forever. 

Life is about the ups and downs. What self-development experts proclaim about living everyday and second happy is not true. It's in fact an unrealistic goal. 

Pain is part of who we are as humain beings. Sometimes it eat us from inside until we can't no more. But, we fight and we live through it.


We fake happiness by doing what we should do: having a job, taking care of ourselves, socializing, doing hobbies and art,  until we forget about it. 


Some people are good at forgetting, others are not. Some are good fakers others are bad fakers. At the end, every living being suffer. 


Death can be the end of suffering, but what is after death. You're not there to judge if you'll feel better, at least we're not sure. 

The reality is that you are here, and you can't waste your chances. Maybe tomorrow you'll feel good again.

And please be with someone. You don't have to suffer alone.  Get in touch with family, old friends... you can PM me if you need someone to talk to.

Your life is valuable. You're valuable. Stay strong and fight.

Peace to you.

Try to stay out of home  (  be with friends, library, join a club in your school or outside) anything that can put you away from him without wasting your life on drugs or on being with bad people. 


Try to talk to your mom, if she's willing to listen, and persuade her into getting out of the house, maybe to a family's or to your own if she's working or could work and pay the rent.


Other thing you can do is to find a part time job; it depends on your availability right now and your state of mind; but it will help you gain self-worth and to start freeing yourself financially from your dad. 

That's been said, I believe that people can be changed, for some it come as miracle, a message from god to them to switch to the right path, for others it's the hard work, self-empovement and other's help. Maybe your dad can be changed, and maybe he can not. 

The bottom line here is you should make some effort with the help of your mom, family and friends to get things fixed, but do not waste your whole life trying. 

Take the initiative and give him a period of time, 3 month, 6 months or 1 year. Change don't come easy. But if he's still on his ways take your own road away from him and try to forget/forgive him. 

We don't get to choose our parents. We are here because of them. But we shouldn't blame it all on them. It's this difficult journey toward adulthood when we begin to see the reality of life and when we embrace responsibilities. 

I hope that you can find the strenght to pass through this storm. I hope in the future that you could look back on this and smile.

If you think that taking a rest period isolating yourself will get you any better you are wrong. 

I thought the same. I was saying to myself when I was out trying to socialize and to get my life together that I better be home, sweet home, in my sofa, watching endless tv shows episodes, switching back and forth between SFW and NSFW to philosophical existential to nihilism. 

Not doing anything at all will not solve anything in your  life it will make it worse, because when you're alone without any real matter keeping your mind busy, negative thoughts rule your reality.

The bottom line here, and it's the most important thing that took me out of my misery, is the survival mode. What I mean by that doing poorly is better than doing nothing. For instance, finding a not very good job is far better than staying home waiting for someone to pay your bills. 

Once you pass the first phase of transition from worth shit to worth something not very big by focusing on one thing that really matters in your life, you can start making little improvements.

I am not saying that it's that easy, and life isn't the same for everyone one, but we can try to do our best. Maybe our best is not the best ever made, but it's enough for us to make our life a little bit less painful and a little bit more peaceful.

If we human species came all long this way and survived our primal instinct and our differences, it's because we agreed on some basic concepts, like rights and responsibilities. 

For instance, my rights' scope ends when others' begin. That's a mundane and universal truth that all civilized and sane minds converge on. If we cannot accept this truth, we will not keep on living in this world as we do today, because our world is built on trust and common values between complete stangers. 

That's been said, one expressing their personal opinion on the right of a complete strangers living their life according to their own moral values, is expanding the first right's territory on the expense of the latter's. The other way around is untrue."

Let's say i was hooked to this show. It got really this great balance action/drama and the characters development is by far the best that I have ever seen in television. 

The ending was phenomenal. All the pieces falling together in the puzzle, no wasted potentials and plot, all the emotional and rational investment in the show was rewarded as we saw the major character each having a fair ending. 

I think I have to re-watch BB so I can savour it's real greatness."
