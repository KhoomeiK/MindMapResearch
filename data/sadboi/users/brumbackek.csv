depression,euw9l58,t3_chq1ui,1564072604.0,"You are absolutely not alone. Recent going through a rough patch with my depression and I cant even put it into words to try and explain what Iâ€™m going through because I donâ€™t know myself! Itâ€™s okay to not be able to put it into actual words, youâ€™ve come to terms with it and thatâ€™s good"

It may be hard but donâ€™t let it ruin your sex/love life. Not all men are complete assholes like him and youâ€™ll find someone who treats you the way you deserve! Keep your head up ðŸ’œ"
