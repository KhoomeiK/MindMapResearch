Mad Rad Hair

Not that bad compared to his other stuff,but didn't Damien said he had a thing with cutting girls hair before assaulting them?
Also,didn't he pretend to have a hair salon?

It's like he's telling us what he does to this girl.It's so creepy."

BPD,fmcrw57,t3_fugcf8,1585951605.0,"Hey!
First of all,I apologise for my english.
I was literally in this situation 4 months ago. We dated 3 years,the guy was abusive both mentally and physically and I still didn't want to break up with him because I couldn't bear with the thought of him finding someone better. He ended up breaking up with me after cheating. This is what I did,after coming back to my country( we were supposed to move here together at first,after finding out he cheated I was so pissed that I literally paid 300$ to change the flights so I could fly in the next day) and what helped me: I cut ALL the ties. I deleted all my social media. I don't speak with anyone that knew both of us. I forbidden my family of speaking about him , sold all his stuff and deleted all pictures of him. It's like he never existed. I don't check what he's doing because I know if I do I will have a breakdown.
Hope my experience helps and hope you feel better soon! 

If you need someone to talk,feel free to DM me!"
