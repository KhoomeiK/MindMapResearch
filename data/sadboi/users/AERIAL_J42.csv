depression,ezkntp0,t1_ezkn9dt,1567963509.0,"Yeh... I’m not sure there are exact words in the English language for the feeling I’m trying to express, but I’m sure someone more literate than me might be able to. And yes, I always felt that being miserable was less of a hassle than trying to get better, as ‘getting better’ felt pointless/useless/irritating anyway."

depression,ewj6l92,t3_cml6ni,1565462074.0,"Battled with severe depression, anxiety and low self esteem/body issues since the age of 10, it’s been 7 years now. When I finally had a mental breakdown (uncontrollable shaking and severe unprovoked physical pain) I told my mum for the first time about my mental state, dropped out of boarding school after having just moved less than a year ago. 

Got diagnosed with ADD + mild ASD, so was given a load of Ritalin and Prozac, neither really solved anything for me. Tried weed, Hell I even tried DMT, though that just seemed to make everything seem even more meaningless than it already is. 

When I am not stimulated (most of the time), I’m literally just an empty sack of meat with zero energy, fantasising about partial hanging methods. On the rare occasion that I have energy, I put everything into practising/creating music.

I just don’t know what the fuck to do, I have two friends who I see pretty much never, and spend most of my days in self imposed solitary confinement, only being motivated to do music when taking some kind of amphetamine. Why can’t I just have normal mood regulation like everyone else? Fck this shit. Hope I build enough courage to catch the bus soon"
