Whatcouldgowrong,fjiplmy,t1_fjimju4,1583372872.0,"Here is a good chunk of the ASPCA official statement on Pitbulls. I think it gives a good synopsis: 

"" Some pit bulls were selected and bred for their fighting ability. That means that they may be more likely than other breeds to fight with dogs. It doesn‚Äôt mean that they can‚Äôt be around other dogs or that they‚Äôre unpredictably aggressive.¬† Other pit bulls were specifically bred for work and companionship. These dogs have long been popular family pets, noted for their gentleness, affection and loyalty. And even those pit bulls bred to fight other animals were not prone to aggressiveness toward people. Dogs used for fighting needed to be routinely handled by people; therefore aggression toward people was not tolerated. Any dog that behaved aggressively toward a person was culled, or killed, to avoid passing on such an undesirable trait. Research on pet dogs confirms that dog aggressive dogs are no more likely to direct aggression toward people than dogs that aren‚Äôt aggressive to other dogs.

It is likely that that the vast majority of pit bull type dogs in our communities today are the result of random breeding‚Äîtwo dogs being mated without¬† regard to the behavioral traits being passed on to their offspring.¬† The result of random breeding is a population of dogs with a wide range of behavioral predispositions. For this reason it is important to evaluate and treat each dog, no matter its breed, as an individual.

While a dog‚Äôs genetics may predispose it to behave in certain ways, genetics do not exist in a vacuum. Rather, behavior develops through a complex interaction between environment and genetics. This is an especially important consideration when we look at an individual dog versus a breed. Many diverse and sometimes subtle factors influence the development of behavior, including, but not limited to, early nutrition, stress levels experienced by the mother during pregnancy, and even temperature in the womb. And when it comes to influencing the behavior of an individual dog, factors such as housing conditions and the history of social interactions play pivotal roles in behavioral development. The factors that feed into the expression of behavior are so inextricably intertwined that it‚Äôs usually impossible to point to any one specific influence that accounts for a dog becoming aggressive. This is why there is such variation in behavior between individual dogs, even when they are of the same breed and bred for the same purpose. Because of the impact of experience, the pit bull specifically bred for generations to be aggressive may not fight with dogs and the Labrador retriever bred to be a service dog may be aggressive toward people."" 

&#x200B;

To lump all dogs of one breed together would be similar to lumping all people of one ethnicity together. Each dog is an individual, just like each person and they will react to certain situations based on their genetics, their indicidual personalities, and the experiences they have had situationally in their lives.  Not all pitbulls are bad."
