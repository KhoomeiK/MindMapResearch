smalldickproblems,fox9wp0,t1_foo8bgo,1588137824.0,I feel like I should weigh in here and encourage you guys if it’s ok. My boyfriend is very overweight and told me at his skinniest he is about four inches. He’s so fucking hot to me for many other reasons than dick size or weight. He spent a LOT of time learning how to eat pussy and fingerbang women and is VERY good at it. He is SUPER good at talking dirty and edging me. Learn those things and your woman will not give a shit about your penis size and will enjoy the dick penetration as well. Another thing he did is tell me beforehand about his dick siZe. Any women who rejects a man because of learning that is a piece of shit and you can do better.❤️
