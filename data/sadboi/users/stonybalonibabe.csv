BPD,fclu7xf,t3_ehfu4k,1577756580.0,"my mom pretty much neglected me off and on as a kid when her depression got bad or she had a new boyfriend. Now she’s married with two little kids in a big house. We basically look like a white picket fence family now. She’s giving my half siblings the life I wanted growing up. My childhood was incredibly different from theirs and sometimes if I think about it to much I get really angry with my mom. But she’s doing better and I’m glad my siblings basically have a whole different mother than I had, so I can’t be to mad I guess. I Can’t forgive my father and his wife since they’ve never tried to make amends for physical, emotional, and verbal abuse and they refuse to acknowledge it happening."

trashy,fanz0mg,t3_ea3q65,1576253820.0,As a horse and dog owner this behavior is absolutely disgusting and pure laziness. You shouldn’t have an animal if you cant proper clean up after it. That poor foal is going to be raised on a bottle and bottle babies are weird. I have a bottle baby and he’s weird. No bueno

trashy,fafeb55,t1_faew2su,1576020627.0,And they’ll tell you how many or if you can have animals. My HOA dictates you can only have 3 dogs or cats. If you have more they’ll contact the city to remove your animals. Oh also they dictated what fence we could put up. They also decided to spray everywhere that is owned by the HOA (we have protected land from development) with pesticides despite we have quite a lot of wildly life and neighborhood pets and kids running around. Because apparently bug free bright green grass is more important than not harming wild life or potentially pets and children🤷‍♀️
