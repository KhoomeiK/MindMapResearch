1. His hyperloop is a joke (thunderf00t on youtube has a great series on it).
2. When the Thai soccer team was trapped in a cave system, Musk came in and, though no one asked, said basically ""You're lucky this caught my attention. here's your solution, your welcome."" And he was just dead wrong, and when a diver a british man living in thailand told him to kindly fuck off since he didn't know what he was talking about, Musk went on a narc rage, even saying that the diver that was SAVING CHILDREN was a pedophile, since that's the *only*  reason a white guy would live in Thailand.
3. Not sure why more people don't talk about some of the shady business practices by musk. Like false documents. Not just like him trying to get more money, but like, safety type shit.

In elementary school I played in a high school orchestra, when I went to college I had music scholarships and was at the top of my class. Fast forward 6 or 7 years after high school graduation and I was a complete failure as a musician. I barely made it through university. Everyone around me progressed drastically, while I progressed a bit but no where near where I was expected. I couldn't afford to live, and had no life experience. After a rough break up, I decided to quit my shitty job I only took because I couldn't get enough work teaching and performing, and I gave up music all together. I realized I had a lot of pain associated with music. Successful musicians are often deeply troubled so what was I working for?? It just wasn't worth it to me. I moved 1000 miles away to the suburban sprawl close to my parents. I completely reassessed my life, what I cared about, what I wanted out of life. I worked my ass off, something I just never learned to do because things came too easy when I was young. It ended up being a good decision. That was 7 years ago. Things are better than I imagined they'd be, which was admittedly abysmally low. I'm married, career is looking okay, even in this crazy time we are in."

Gangstalking,fkyep5y,t1_fkyb1g1,1584647261.0,"I would call that awfully convenient. You can't subvert science and logic, sorry. 

You can never directly prove/disprove that the tree makes a noise in the forest, since directly observing means you are ""there"". You could say maybe it doesn't, or maybe only 1 out of 10 make a noise when they fall, and hey, I can't DIRECTLY prove you wrong since we can never observe it directly. But what we do observe is the nature and mechanics of sound. That means if you make the claim that there isn't a noise, you aren't just making one single claim, you are making 1000's of claims which requires you also prove a whole new model of fluid mechanics, the atmosphere, even the chemical makeup of the universe.  

Every observed case of gangs stalking has been linked to PTSD and delusions. It's impossible to observe EVERY SINGLE case, just like it is impossible to observe every single tree falling, but according to what we have observe, this is the conclusion. If you have compelling evidence that better describes the world around us, you can be published in a peer reviewed article, but until you do that, the current accepted theory is the accepted theory."
Gangstalking,fky9cyf,t1_fky0m8i,1584644227.0,"Of course it's possible. But logic and science don't work within what is ""possible"". It works within what is observable. Sure a tree might not make noise when it falls if no one is around to hear it, but all evidence shows that what we call sound is actually a mechanical wave that exists outside the mind. So of course it makes a noise, but we can never ""prove"" this. We can only go off of accepted science that best describes what is happening. You can claim it doesn't make noise, but then you have to do a better job at explaining the world around us, for instance, why would a mechanical pressure wave not be triggered just because no one is around? It would require profound evidence. Same with gangstalking. According to accepted science, it is caused by ptsd and schizophrenia-related symptoms. By all means you can discover something to explain it too, but it's gotta do a better job at explaining the world around us than the currently accepted theory.
