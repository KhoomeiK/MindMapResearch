Soft cover boxes or singular DVD/Bluray boxes up until the series is over, at which point two versions of the last DVD/BluRay(s) is sold, one by itself and one with a hardcover Collectors box that you can put the previous DVD's or box sets in. 

Generally all the boxes will follow a similar theme so that it looks nice and uniform when the Collectors box is filled with the entire series.
