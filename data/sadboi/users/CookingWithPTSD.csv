Analyze the surroundings first. Observe, read between the lines. What does she crave? What makes her weak? How can you poke her, till she basically does her work for you? 

Ns are veeery dangerous, but also very reactive. If you work subliminally, you can push them to self-destruct. 

This is a very refine game, and requires total control of your own emotions. 

This is a long game.

Also, there is a short cut, that don't require violence and pushing and shoving demons around. Yeah, those are not people, those are demons. The people don't usually dwell on the borders. We don't really care.

So, the short cut is you just wait for the last stop. It might take somewhere between a few hours and a few decades, but don't worry, you won't age even a second, time works funny here. You will arrive, and the train will be empty, and this will be your stop.

\*sigh\*

Let me explain.

Purgatory is a nice and quiet place, quite cozy, when you manage to make it your home. It's a multitude of parallel worlds, so this is why the stops with the same name look similar, there are different realms here, so we folk rarely stumble into each other. But they are all held together, it's like a spider web, if you will.

There are plenty ways to get here, except the last train one.

The most common and widely used is just getting an iron key, and going to a door.

Here comes the kicker, you need to hold your key in your hand, it best works if it is at night, around 0300, the dead of night. You need to prepare and be in the right mindset. Metal actually absorbs your energy, that's why the coin trick works. The coin suck up your desperation at this moment.

And that is the key, despair. You need to feel total and utter despair to open the door. Even a grain of hope will get stuck in the keyhole and it won't open. You need to feel totally abyssal to enter.

Once you open the door, you will see two paths, it doesn't really matter, which one you chose, they all lead to the same place, which is Nowhere. In Nowhere, you can start and build your life again. You can find some shreds of reality and start from scratch. You will have lost your mind completely at this point. Madness is one of the conditions of your stay here."

So, what are emotions? This is effective communication. 

Meaning emotions tell us our current state and what we need in order to have a competitive advantage. 

Every emotion is very important. Anger means you are registering danger, and reacting to it. More often than not, that danger is subliminal, undetected, thus your anger seems irrational. 

But it never really is. Just subliminal. 

What is subliminal? 

Our sub-conscious mind. 

Our  brains make a decision approx. 7 minutes, before we realize it. So, there are always forces underneath. 

The more you understand, the more control you have. 

It all boils down to this, suppressed emotions will control you, 

but you are the one that controls the processed emotions. 

The question is, what is that you need? 

You are angry, because someone threatened you. You need safety? 

You are angry, you were being neglected. You need comfort and attention?

I was always very skeptical about him, due to the fact that all people I knew who were reading him were pretentious douches, and they liked to quote him, but totally meaningless. 
I did try to read him, but I was too busy. I was delighted at the beauty of his sentences, it made me longing for more. But the lack of time, and my prejudice got in the way. 
Now, I understand what his point is. 

I meditated a lot about all what you shared. 
First, about the golden shackles, this is reasonable. You still have a lot to levy. Choices are complicated. Mine was a golden cage, I was overwhelmed with rules, I could not bend or influence. I did not like the game, so I quit. 

It reminds me of one of the best thing I learned in my academic carrier. 
In France, there is this notion of [Systeme D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_D)
Well, I just read the Wiki, apparently not only in France, but still this is when it originated. 
There is this sweet verb in French, se débrouiller, which loosely translates to hustle, but in a legal way. 

How it translates in business, ignore those rules you can, bend those rules that allow it, and create new rules, when you have the power to do so. Basically, keep testing the system, till you get your way. Pretty neat, isn't it? 

I can testify that France works a bit like that, bureaucracy has its good sides, too. This is basically what the courtier of the royal Palace evolved into. A multitude of contradicting rules makes it possible to levy your way undetected. This you can find everywhere. There comes the time, when if they are too many rules, this means the rules get irrelevant. 

Which brings me to math. Or more importantly, the Fibonacci sequence, or the Golden ration. This is a beautiful sequence, that explains the rules of the universe, as well as a [small shell.](https://www.goldennumber.net/nautilus-spiral-golden-ratio/) 

It all starts with zero, nothingness, after that there is one, the big bang, the raw elements of nature, another one, suns form, water emerges, then it starts to get more, we have 2, now a planet gravitating around a sun, a living cell swimming in the vast ocean, till you get to a complex organism. How evolution works. ""I think, therefore I am."" 
It's neat, it's universal, it's beautiful. 

But fuck that. There is nothing neat in nature. Nature is chaotic and unyielding. There is nothing neat in mathematics either. One would be a fool to think math is rational. The more you dwell deeper into the rabbit hole the more you see rules are made to be broken or ignored. Louis Carol was a brilliant mathematician, and his books are an awe to the mathematical chaos, we are subjected to. 

What happens when you divide by zero? 
The best we can do is infinity in an approximation. 

Which is good enough. What happens to the Fibonacci sequence, when it goes to infinity, it loses its value, it loses sense. The Fibonacci sequence is subjected to what it really is, it's just a shell that we use to explain what is happening. 

Well, we cannot just ignore the zero for our convenience. We think, therefore we are? How about the jellyfishes, they do not have a brain, and yet they are technically immortal. 

There is anti-matter, which we cannot fully grasp, huge black holes, around universes gravitate. 
And when we look small, we have atoms, and we have space between the smallest particles, a nothingness within us. 

We all will get divided by zero eventually, and then we will know what will happen."
48lawsofpower,fq4k795,t1_fq0jvyv,1589078801.0,"His book was one of the things that pushed me to change my life drastically. 
I would not be that hasty into glorifying the man, though. 
I am sure to say his thinking is limited. 

His book is about the rules of war, the rules of peace are different. 
And his claim is this rules are universal. They are not. 
All rules are imaginary to begin with. If you understand you have the power to bend reality to your will, you know that rules are made to be broken or ignored. 

The rules of peace though, one can find in religious texts. But if one is wise to read between the lines, and not take it seriously, but for what it is, a subliminal history book, telling the tales of many heroes and villains across times. 

Carl Jung was good to summarize the notion of archetypes. 
Archetypes are a combination of symbols and tales that tell a story, show 
the Zeitgeist. 
Basically, connect us with ourselves. 
Take Micheal, one of my favorite angels. He is very different in his original description of what we are used to. 
Actually, the series Supernatural have a somewhat good description, minus the depth of character that is, but this show does not pride itself on depth anyway. It is just fun. 

Micheal is a fierce warrior, protector, guardian, as much as he is kind, is he deadly. His path is that of discipline, courage, and protection. 

Also, on the opposite, we have Lucifer, my ultimate favorite. The archetype of Prometheus. The one who stole fire from Olympus and brought it to the humans in a selfless act of love. 
The Gods were furious at the young Titan, so they chained him to a rock, damned and forsaken for an eternity, only an eagle keeping him company, an eagle eating his liver over and over again. 
Prometheus is a mix between Jesus and Lucifer in my opinion. We have the light bringer, which is Lucifer in Latin, who brings critical thinking, questions God and says no, what are you doing? Knowledge is power. And God doesn't like sharing, he cast Adam and Eve for just eating from the apple of Knowledge, so he forsake his most beautiful angel into the pits of Hell.
Place for nothing but despair. 
And Jesus who was crucified on the cross for just trying to do what's right. 

The difference is that the Gods of Old are not all good and all powerful, they are flawed just like us. The original Gods being the unyielding forces of nature, and the inevitable death that awaits us all. 
This somehow got lost in the process for the quest for power. 

You have basically two paths, both very important, the path of power and the path of Knowledge. Both paths are very nicely depicted in Dr. Faustus of Goethe.

I moved to Germany, I was shocked of what people called tomatoes, those plastic red thing you call tomato, interesting... They sure look a bit like tomatoes, like a paler and smaller version, and they have the ghost of the taste of tomatoes, so technically they are tomatoes. 

I was even more surprised, when I discovered some people have actually never tasted real tomatoes. I eventually found a way, the Turkish and Asian shops had decent vegetables. But still. I feel really sorry for those poor souls, who think a plastic lookalike is the same as the veggie. 

If you are one of those people, you can branch out and look for veggies outside your usual sources. A real tomato is a treat to eat raw, and doesn't have a plastic taste. A real cucumber is crunchy and salty, not mushy. A vegetable grown in a tube for mass production tastes very different than those grown in nature.

Prometheus was the original light bringer, which is what Lucifer means in Latin. 

Bringer of light, illumination. He questioned God, and was the first to say, no, why? Critical thinking is his forte. Knowledge is power. God did not want to share that power. 

Same as with Prometheus, the story there is more straight forwards though. He shared the Godly fire with the mortals. Fire is power. So, the people could cook, and take care of themselves. They didn't need the gods anymore. And Gods don't like sharing power and they got angry. So, they cast him out, they chained him to a rock, for an eagle to eat his liver over and over again. Which is hell and damnation. In the story, Herlules saved him, I believe... I will google later. 

Same, thing. Knowledge is power. We had massive burning of books and of witches (healers and scholars in other words) during the middle ages. Or hoarding of books, the Vatican library is closed to the public. Today, we are flooded in fake news.

Those books are for war, not for peace. 

For peace I mostly take inspiration from philosophy, or great people such as Charlie Chaplin. I listen to his dictator speech, when I feel down. 

Psychology games are the secret identities games, like Avalon, Mafia, or secret Hitler. The last being my favorite, due to the dynamic of the game. 
You have fascists and liberals. In the fascists there is one Hitler, who has no idea who his allies are, and the fascists know everything. So, Hitler's goal is to find out secretly who the allies are, and to support them, fascists need to protect Hitler and to fool all the people that they are liberals, so they can trust them. A bit devilish game, hehe, but pretty awesome to make people trust you. If you play it with players that take the psychological aspect seriously, it can be pretty amazing. I have spent nights playing it with no sings of getting bored. 

So, I would say it's a bit like poker, but with a longer strategy, and the fact that you not only have to convince the others that you are innocent, but you have to spin it to blame someone else. It works great, if you need to get out of a sticky situation, and I had the short stick in life, I had to be smart to make it.  

It's all about playing on other people's feelings. It works best, if you are dealing with emotional people, you can give an impression that emotions are taking the best of you, in order to look weak, but this is only bait, this is only to observe the reaction, to observe the weak spot. And once you got someone emotionally, you can spin it to your advantage. Feelings over facts rule a lot of lives. If something feels true, it is true. 

But if you have facts on your side, you can spin the feelings, and no one can spin you.

Actions speak louder than words. A suffering person needs care, too. When we suffer, we are tired, and we sometimes we can't even perform simple tasks like cooking, and self-care. The brain is 2% of the body weight, but it consumes 20% of the body energy. Suffering takes a toll on the body. 

Also, be a bit careful with ""I am so sorry this is happening to you"" Personally, I hate that. I always clam up, when someone says that. I don't want pity, I don't want regret, I want someone to feel for me.

For though the officials sought medical diagnosis of the infectious disease in their midst, doctors at Marseilles were by no means unanimous in declaring that what they were dealing with was plague. Dr Sicard was the first to diagnose the disease as the fearsome plague but others, such as Dr Bauzon, disagreed, arguing that it was yet another [fever](https://infectiousdiseases.edwardworthlibrary.ie/Fevers). As Francois Chicoyneau, perhaps the most famous commentator on the Marseilles plague, explained in his reports from Marseilles, reports collected by Edward Worth, there were a host of [symptoms](https://infectiousdiseases.edwardworthlibrary.ie/Plague/Symptoms) and a time factor involved in their appearance.

The great Plague happened because the church burned down all the healers, and start spreading fake news. This had dire consequences that lasted centuries, we have the effects to this day. But no one cares. This is what means that history that is forgotten, is repeated.

Fake news are spreading like a plague. No one cares, no accountability. And this has real consequences.

The real reason was rampant fake news, in the form of the church telling people to pray the plague away, sounds oddly familiar doesn't it? We are drowning in false news now. I wonder what would happen if we actually hold people accountable for lying and getting others killed with spreading misleading information? I am sure nothing, this has nothing to do with the spread, right? Media is totally irrelevant. Silly journalist, to think they have some sort of contribution to society. It's social distancing.

We are living in a world, where abuse is the norm, not the exception, so going to the police is like asking for more abuse. Rape or not rape, this is abuse, and this is a crime, a serious one, that is. 

I am saying this to put things into perspective. You are alone and quite helpless in the real world as well. Maybe the police can help, but I really doubt it. 

Yeah, labels as ""that girl"" will fly, so my best advice is think of your recovery and what happened to you. You went through trauma, and you are minimizing it already. You are up against a lot of scrutiny for being a victim. All of this requires a lot of mental energy, that you do not have the luxury to spend right now. 

Abusers get away with stuff like that, but abused get all the victim-blaming. 

I would advise you to take the first step and acknowledge that what happened to you was terrible, and that person abused you badly. Because it was bad. This scene attracts a lot of abusers, and not enough attention is given to it. This is not a ""scene gone bad"" this is torture disguised as kink. 

You need care, love, nurture and safety. 

The second step, is to hone on that anger more. You hate confrontations, I understand that, but anger can literally save your life next time. Start some fighting, or shooting. Anything that can get your blood pumping. Rage is very important for survival. Hone it and  you will be better at handling conflicts.
