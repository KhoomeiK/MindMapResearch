Stutter,fplc3i8,t3_gdq3o4,1588710058.0,"Same. Sometimes I just need to eat something at burger king but I don't know what I want to try out next, so I always order the X-tra Long Chili Cheese Burger ðŸ˜…"
Stutter,fp8arml,t3_gb3p4a,1588387708.0,"Yes I can really relate to that topic. Actually, I was meant to have speech therapy during spring break but it didn't take place because of the whole Corona bullshit. Instead, I signed up for the so called ""online therapy"" which has helped me at first but I find it really difficult to work on my stutter while I can't practice any of the situations in real life and normal day-to-day communication."
Stutter,fp898az,t3_g4ex8l,1588386677.0,"I've tryed Xanax before and it was the only thing which improved it significantly, though I was to afraid to take it regularly due to the high risk of developing a dependence on the drug because I know that especially benzos can really lead to some bad consequences. Experimenting with different types of substances is actually tempting at first but when it comes down to treating it, I would strongly advise anyone who suffers from stuttering to avoid drugs as a coping mechanism."
