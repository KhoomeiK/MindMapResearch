AmItheAsshole,fqjc21v,t1_fqj97yd,1589407842.0,"I didn't say ""an"" I said ""more"" effort but I think you're right and I should have said ""endearment"" ""eagerness"" or ""heart"". I'm clearly not a native speaker, sorry for the miscommunication. But if he's not pulling his weight in (and not even trying to) for their wedding and still partakes in fake planning conversation (even during work calls) with a smile, in my book, that's still a tad insulting.

She stated that she nagged him to help her call vendors. Could be several things: they could plan their wedding for next year, or just try to cancel what they originally planned. It might not be the same everywhere but where I live, if you booked an anulation assurance, you still have to call them to get the money back, and sometimes jump through loops trying to get them to pay you (because it might be too close to the actual date, or because you have to give specific reasons of annulment)

While I personally find the work spouse dynamic repulsive ( also it's not even a fake wedding but a vow renewal, which for some reason I find creepier, as if his fiance will ""just"" be his second wife) I don't think the problem lies in him making jokes with his colleagues. The problem isn't that"" he didn't do anything wrong"", it's that it seems he doesn't do anything for their actual wedding. Yes she overreacted, but he isn't blameless. She's overworked and stressed, and as I mentioned in another comment, while it's wrong for her to ask such a thing from him, part of the reason why she reacted that way is because of hin unsupportiveness. She's handling the whole mental load of the wedding on her own. While I don't know their situation, at the end of the day, BOTH of them will be married to each other, they should both share responsibilities."
AmItheAsshole,fqj6ow6,t1_fqj5kcq,1589405782.0,"I responded the way I did because the thread kept turning him into a blameless victim (when I answered), maybe I should have added /s because yeah, I'm dumb, but not enough to actually believe that planning a real and a fake thing are the same.

If you go to her profile, then comment, it's right there. I'm on mobile and can't link it properly
For me"" nagging constantly "" someone sure seems like she asked him quite a few times. 

While they were not planning anything elaborate (and probable anything real) he's still showing more interest in that fake thing than their wedding.

I'm not saying she's right for asking him to speak to his coworkers, that's why I haven't put a judgment in my comments, but he his not totally blameless in the situation either."
AmItheAsshole,fqj44gg,t1_fqj3lh6,1589404783.0,Except there is no wedding planner in this situation and the stress of the situation only falls on his fiance. That's probably not helping her mental load.
AmItheAsshole,fqj3mcb,t1_fqi2o0r,1589404589.0,Maybe his fiance would be more fun if he was a bit more active in the wedding planning process and she wouldn't have to support the stress all on her own?
AmItheAsshole,fqj3br2,t1_fqi7f0s,1589404478.0,"From his stressed fiance pov he's making more effort for a fake thing. While I get it's funnier because nothing is at stake, I can also see how it is really shitty for his fiance to see him seemingly give more shit about his work wife's vow renewal than his own wedding.
I did not ment to equal both of those things, but people defending him like he's blameless and she's just crazy struck a nerve. If she has to nag him to call some vendors and he still doesn't do it, I can see why she would be mad at his unresponsiveness , and lash it out when she sees him fake plan another ceremony (even if imo she overreacted). I think it's a drop making the whole vase overflow situation."
AmItheAsshole,fqj210c,t1_fqj0ylv,1589403973.0,"If he really wanted to marry this woman, he would put his big boy pants on, and help her plan THEIR wedding as she asked. While he's not responsible for covid, he's, in her eyes, showing more interest in another ceremony, albeit fake, than (again) his own wedding day.
From the comments, she's not even asking him to plan the whole thing. Just call some vendors. Which seems reasonable. 
 I get being laid back, but if your partner asks you for help regarding your wedding, and you show so little interest in it they have to ""nag"" about it, you're already an ass. Throw the ""work spouse"" in the middle, and it indeed doesn't look good. Add covid and the stress related to it, and that's a shit show.

Also, it didn't took THAT long since he arrived at the hospital 2 HOURS after his daughter's birth. It was a few hours for sure, but the way it reads in his original post, it didn't last 15 hours either. 
Also, that was more than 3 months ago, so chances are pretty slim it was a national emergency? Unless you're referring to something else in that case I apologise, but my point still stand: if you prioritised your work, even as an essential, over what could be your last moment with your wife, or the support you could gave her if something went wrong (which, again, could have likely happened since she had 2 miscarriages and a stillbirth), you're a moron. 
In the end, if anything wrong had happened, no one here would take his side. He made the post because he felt that , since it all went ""fine"" he was not an ass for basically abandoning his wife during what she admitted was the most scary moment of her life.

* 1 cup soft salted butter
* 3 tsp lemon juice or white vinegar
* 1tsp baking soda
* 1tsp baking powder
* 3 or 4 tsp of rum extract, depending on how strong you like the flavor and how strong your extract brand is
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1 tsp allspice mix/ speculoos spice mix/ pumpkin spice mix
* cinnamon sugar for coating (sugar + cinnamon to taste)

Beat butter and sugar till creamy

add eggs one at the time

add spices, baking powder, baking soda, lemon juice/vinegar, and extract

mix in the flour until just combined

make 1 inch balls of dough, and coat with cinnamon sugar, then place on a baking sheet covered in parchment paper

flatten the ball with the bottom of a glass to a ½ inch height

bake at 180C-350F for 8 to 9 minutes, on the upper and lower rack, flipping midway through

According to my dad it's because my mom became a real controlling bitch, a nagging cunt and about 20 other nice things.
Truth is, she finally told him no. For 30 years he got away with everything: never being present at home, being aggressive, going to the gym 3 times a week for over 3 hours while having a teenage daughter he never took care of, meds, alcohol, alcohol on meds,refusing to go anywhere, mean comments on our bodies and how we should work out... he was very entitled too, and expected us to drop everything once he said so. When he started having an emotional affair, a porn addiction and using illegals drugs to be better at bodybuilding, he gaslighted her. And when she realised it, she told him to either stop going out with the woman (he was doing her shopping, buying her flowers, they went out for coffee several times, all that while he would treat us like shit) or she would leave. They start sleepimg in different rooms, and he would spend less and less time downstair with us (not that he was that present to begin with.) He accepted after a few months to go to couple therapy, but didn't got his way. When the counselor asked my mom when was she going to tell him no, she said ""that's why we're here"". Seing the therapist side with her made him so angry he stormed off, and he yelled while punching the door that he will file for a divorce.
He never did, my mom had to because she can't live like that, paying for his expenses too while earning half his salary (we wanted to move out, but he said it should be him because he had less stuff than us and it would be cheaper. Ended up in a 3 bedroom apartment in an expensive area because we can't ""expect him to live like a student in a dorm"". He knew I wasn't coming to live with him too... he also moved out 12 days after my maternal grandmother died, while he had the keys of his new apartment for a month already. He just wanted to stay longer to piss us off, but realised with my nan's death that he was not getting the attention he wanted.)
So they divorced because my mom got fed up with his shit and tried to accept it for too long. She still struggles, and we both try to make excuses for him, but the truth is the man he was doesn't exist anymore. They don't share the same values and he basically wanted to live like a celibate young adult while still being catered to by my mom. He has a few mental illnesses, but never took care of them, so I don't forgive him for being a shitty human being and acting like a spoiled teenager at 60."

He's being manipulative by telling you, possibly trying to ostracise you from your friend. Him admitting what he did can make him seem honnest, but the fact that he looked through your friend list, then lied to you (if he was looking for your guy friends, which is creepy enough why did he clicked on her profile?)  Twice (when you were on the phone and about how he ended up looking at her pics) raise some red flags that make me see the situation differently. Sorry but he might be playing with your emotions.
Dump his ass, tell your best friend and block him."

Dunno if those count but oh well...
 
•You can make gnocchi with whole grain flour, but it will be grainy. Avoid that by blending the flour first.
 
•You cam even make it with almond, chickpea, hazelnut,... flour
 
•GREAT garlic oil: 1 cup olive oil (or any oil you like), half a garlic (not the clove, the whole thing) peeled and finely chopped, simmer on low to medium heat til the garlic get golden. Keep the garlic in the oil. Garlic will stay crispy for 2 to 3 weeks but the oil stays flavorful for months. GREAT for marinades, cooking, or even frying. 
 
•easy sea salted caramel sauce: 2 sticks salted butter, 1 and 1/2 cup of sugar, together in a pan, on medium heat. It'll melt and bubble a bit (if it bubbles too much, lower the heat). It should be an amber color, lighter than usual caramel sauce. Add between  4.5 to 7 oz of liquid cream depending on the thickness you want. The color  will darken when you add the cream.
 
•place coffee or vinegar in a bowl in your fridge to cancel the smell.
 
•Do yourself a favor. Get a salad spiner. 
 
•NEVER put basil, dried oregano, or dried thyme at the beginning of the dish. Put it about 5 minutes before you dish is done or right before serving for basil if you like a more subtle flavor.
 
•You can cook potatoes in the microwave if you cut them in 4 and throw them in the microwave at 600 to 1000 watt in a bowl with an inch of water, for about 5 min. (Check it after 3 minutes)
 
•You can pre cook bell peppers the same way, takes about 6 to 9 minutes.
 
•If you eat a lot of rice, look for rice seasonings in Asian stores. Usually it's called Furikake"
AmItheAsshole,eto7gtc,t3_ccltik,1563017551.0,"If we switch the dress vs tux situation, everyone would tell you YTA if you make someone wear something they're not comfortable with. I don't see this situation as any different, even if it's more than one person (wich is often the case in those other posts). Also, you don't ""need"" to have them in tuxes for pictures. People are not props, they're people. 
Also, I have no clue what your bridesmaids look like, but you have more choice when it comes to dresses to fit a body type than with tuxes... 
I don't think you're a huge asshole per say, because you didn't force them (yet) bit there is a set of expectations laid on both parties when you ask someone to be in your bridal party. You can't be mad at them for being disappointed (especially if they're girly girls...)

There is a few more settings, but from what I've seen/heard/experienced with jeweled rings, for a daily wear, avoid bezels (my amethist ring is set that way) and tension settings. My emerald isn't set with prongs shaped like a straight lines but the ones that grip the top of the stone like an upside down L. I don't think they have a particular name... 
I hope you'll find your ring!"
JustEngaged,etcuniy,t3_cb3dtj,1562692996.0,"Not engaged but I have a gold and (small) emerald ring I wear everyday, that my mom wore every day before I did. I think it's at least 35 y.o and was worn daily for at least 25 years. Not a scratch, never had any problem with the stone moving or falling, and the color is still stunning. I received an amethyst ring 3 years ago, and the stone is getting a bit dull. Emerald is an amazing choice in my book! But the way the stone is set as important as the stone itself. Prefer a ""grippy"" setting (where the little [ grip the stone?), instead of a ""glued"" one."

Dude.
Wake the fuck up. That's a redder flag than the one you see at communist parades.
To add things up, I believe she fell in a routine that she doesn't want to stop. Sure she cleans houses. But only part time and not yours. She dropped out of college as you said so I don't think it's only a part time job just because she has to focus on other things. She has lots of free time and who doesn't like that? Sure, she doesn't have much disposable income, but she still manages to find a way, even if that means she dumps the financial responsibility on you even more, just like when she can't afford her part of the bill.
You love her and don't want her gone, but honestly I'm with you on the gaslighting part. I feel like she's manipulating you so you drop the subject, she keeps doing her things while you still support her. It's not a sustainable situation, she needs to wake up. NTA"

AmItheAsshole,ern0ajn,t3_c2v5es,1561041616.0,"YTA. He was being cautious and it didn't work in the end. It's her choice not to abort or put the baby to adoption, but it's also your son's choice to not be a part of their life since he did everything he could to avoid this situation. He even planned to pay child support. You need to respect that. You're choosing a potential (sorry to be blunt but yeah, pregnancy can go very wrong very quickly.) over your very much alive son.  It will be hard for the baby to grow up without his bio father, but it will be even harder to grow up with someone who resent them because their parent forced them to ""be responsible"". Your son WAS responsible, and honestly I think you're out of your mind to push him to do that just because you want a relationship with the child. No one seems to forbid you to have that relationship, but you don't need to be an ass and drag your son through that. For all we know, the preservative her birth control was defective, or maybe she even tried to trap him, which is more common than people think. You'll probably never know."
