politics,fjrlb9e,t1_fjoh280,1583586865.0,"Dude, the people decide who is Electable. The citizens are the electorate. That’s the giant fallacy in this argument for Biden(or any politician that people hold their nose to vote for). 

Bottom Line: If you like and identify with that person, then that’s who you should vote for. Otherwise why guard your vote like your browser history.

People and pundits keep saying a person has more “electability” as if they are deciding which of the fatted cows should be sacrificed to the legislation gods."

privacy,ezaccz3,t1_ez9zz8d,1567798774.0,"Well, locking down your privacy alone won’t cut it. If you are really looking to scrub your data and information as much as humanly possible it’s a good idea to try out the site “have I been pwnd” and use a good collection of Open source intelligence tools for self lookup like awesome OSINT

Note: be careful about which site you use and what you share on them as the EULA of some of these sites can be laughably open ended and not privacy focused."
