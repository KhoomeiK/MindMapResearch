Seriously though. We know who is most at risk of death. Reopen for those not at risk would be a reasonable start. The great depression *defined* a generation. There’s no guarantee we’ll recover from this if it continues. Covid rates and deaths would increase. No one is denying that. But nearly every public policy decision has human life on the line.

DiagnoseMe,fpct2wv,t1_fpcc161,1588511924.0,"Not a doc. You can’t confirm this on your own. You’ll need to see a doctor. It does slowly get worse over time, and the worse it is, the more likely it will require surgery rather than an office procedure. It’s not something that would kill you but it can become a problem (get’s super painful or you’ll be unable to push it back in)

As long as you aren’t straining a lot or having hard pebble-like stools you’re good. Titrate those until you have soft easy stools.

I don’t think he doesn’t care. I think he believes this is something a surgeon needs to look at because only a surgeon can tell if it needs an office procedure vs. surgery. I recommend finding a general surgeon or colorectal surgeon/proctologist."

Night coughs \*may\* be a sign of asthma and coughing a lot can irritate you're rib joints in the sternum causing chest pain. Usually asthma presents in kids, but it's not uncommon for adults to start having symptoms later on. You can see a primary care like a family medicine doctor for both asthma and anxiety problems! 

As far as if it's dyspnea: When I hear dyspnea, I usually think of a patient hunched over in a tripod position who is breathing so hard the skin above and below the rib cage is retracting in and so out of breath they can't talk in full sentences. If you do see a doctor, they'll want to know specifically what you've been feeling because ""dyspnea"" is somewhat ambiguous."

Psychiatric problems are defined by having a *negative impact on your life* i.e. if this isn’t affecting you so badly that it’s causing serious problems in your life then you’re perfectly fine. If you think it’s a problem you could go talk with someone like a therapist.

There’s people out there with something called schizoid personality disorder where they never get enjoyment from any interpersonal interaction. Basically a hermit. It’s important to recognize when something should be considered a disease, so the fact that you do enjoy time with others means you 100% do *not* have this, but a psychiatrist might say you have schizoid *traits* and not a disorder which is perfectly normal.
