depression,fkvw18i,t1_fkvv7gz,1584577921.0,If they truly love you they would try to understand what you‚Äôre going through and be there for you in any way they can. If they love you and value having you in their life they will do their best to help you make yourself feel better. It‚Äôs hard to be a burden to people that love you and understand what you‚Äôre going through in life
depression,fkvuewt,t1_fkvtdie,1584576936.0,If that was me then I would talk about how nothing interests me and discuss what I could should or would do about it.
depression,fku8xqj,t1_fku4zf7,1584544741.0,"I thought I was the only one that hates talking on the phone!  Everyone hates me for it and I always feel so ashamed of myself that I never want to answer people‚Äôs calls or call back after voicemails üò≠ Recently I think people talk on the phone because they like the sound of their voice . They really enjoy hearing themselves talking about stuff off the top of their head.  
Most of the time, I do not enjoy saying ANYthing that comes to my mind. I like to think a bit first. But, I find humans don‚Äôt really give me enough time to think before I talk, so I avoided most conversation. 


People also said I have a nice speaking voice so I‚Äôm always a bit too conscious about how I sound. I am overall a humble person. I don‚Äôt want anyone telling me I sound ‚Äúlovely‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù on the phone. Telling me when I sound sick, or the worst ‚Äúsounds like you can sing, please sing for me‚Äù ...   I just wanted to sound normal like everyone else and wish humans wouldn‚Äôt be judging and commenting on every little thing about me."
depression,fku7iz5,t1_fkscp4q,1584543906.0,"Glad you found my comments worthwhile. I can‚Äôt tell you what your best options are but hope this helps you feel less anxious overall. I went through the exact same thing with my close friends. I ended up distancing myself, stopped going over to chill so often, knowing that they would invite those other people that I didn‚Äôt like. MY personal circle was small, SO I didn‚Äôt like the idea of my friends having so many flaky friendships with immature people that seemed to be going no where in life.. Me and my friends had really big dreams, goals and ambitions so I hated sitting around doing silly stupid things to post on the gram or Snapchat; hated going to the club/random parties at any opportunity available. But I hated feeling like the party pooper. Seemed like my friends were destined to become more like their ‚Äúparty‚Äù friends. I used to love all the partying too but at some point it all just felt so boring and pointless to me. That led me to feel like we were all growing apart, maturing to become certain types of adults, either responsible or irresponsible. 

    After months without speaking to eachother and making excuses/arguing about why we haven‚Äôt been hanging out as often, I just cut all ties with them. I was thinking they were too irresponsible and out of control for me.. Years later, they are still out of control; sooo I know it was a wise decision for me to stop spending my time around people that I couldn‚Äôt relate to anymore.. but for you it might be different. In the end, I think it all comes down to what you‚Äôre willing and able to tolerate in your life."
depression,fku3we1,t1_fku2uvy,1584541688.0,"Aspirations for the month. New food or music interests. Crazy things experienced this week. Boring things experienced today. Anything besides ‚ÄúWhats up, What are you doing, How was your day, hows the weather, good morning goodnight‚Äù. Small talk gets annoying and feels pointless."
depression,fktzokc,t3_fkpngm,1584538910.0,I thought I was the only one feeling like this. No one wants to have meaningful conversations. Just wasting time.
depression,fksbf0m,t1_fks7gs3,1584486326.0,"I know what you mean... But it might be hard for your friends to realize how you feel and take it easier on you. Because most humans tend to be clueless and unaware of things outside of themselves. Too busy living their lives OR experiencing the dunning Kruger like I was. I thought I knew everything about life, but I didn‚Äôt know anything... I thought all of that behaviour was justifiable/reasonable. But I was a fool and I had a lot to learn about social skills etc...

If they are your real friends then you should be able to tell them straight up that you‚Äôre almost never in the mood for their shenanigans soooo if they don‚Äôt mind, you‚Äôd appreciate if they settle down whenever they‚Äôre around you/ don‚Äôt involve you in ridiculous things since ur clearly not up for it. Jokingly tell them that they should be smart enough to read your body language and say u shouldn‚Äôt even have to complain. If they don‚Äôt respect your wishes then you may unfortunately have to spend less time around them and find people that respect you."
depression,fks78qo,t3_fke1nq,1584483764.0,"I was an extrovert when I was in highschool; I didn‚Äôt realize it though.... I was experiencing the dunning Kruger effect for most of my life. My friends and I did a lot of stupid things too. Looking back I don‚Äôt know why we did it all, but I know it was mostly for fun sake. Random things to create a laugh and keep up the good times, instead of sitting around doing less. You only live once, and you only have one opportunity to be a crazy teenager that does silly things. When you‚Äôre an adult, there‚Äôs less excuses for all of that immaturity. Enjoy your opportunities while you have them. It‚Äôs up to you how you want to behave at times though; I‚Äôm sure your future partner will probably admire your maturity."
depression,fkpgzrv,t1_fkpdew7,1584409941.0,"I need an explanation too... lol. It all really does seems pointless... But I think the point of life is to make it watever you want it to be, regardless of circumstances that are out of your control. Just do whatever you‚Äôre capable of doing and be satisfied with whatever you‚Äôre satisfied with, until you die. Finding interests and working with possibilities. Living and loving. Then death."
depression,fkhjm0v,t1_fkhgye1,1584200305.0,"Yep ive been getting too overwhelmed lately. Hopefully I can stay strong..... All that information is helpful so thank you very much. I didn‚Äôt realize it would take months to get an appointment. 

I don‚Äôt have time to call the therapist because I am too busy/overwhelmed with my day to day responsibilities as a parent cooking cleaning, getting bossed around by a spoiled child.... 
Hopefully I can endure it. 

I also had exactly 3 suicide attempts; prior to having my child. But even after all my episodes and visits to psych ward I‚Äôve never found time to talk to a therapist and I‚Äôve never been on medication. I‚Äôve been self medicating with marijuana for 9 years, but lately I know I can‚Äôt keep using it as a distraction... 

Now I realize I am probably too overwhelmed. I‚Äôll have to sacrifice some things in my life and then find time for a therapist 

Nice to know you found a friend who truly cares for you. That gives me hope!! Thanks a lot"
depression,fkgk1en,t3_ficvg3,1584162266.0,"Making friends is hard for many people; including myself. But who says things in life should be easy? Just kidding. People become friends for a number of reasons, but in my experience friendships usually have a lot to do with convenience. For example, it‚Äôs convenient and easy for you to become friends with your neighbours because you see them everyday and get more opportunities to get to know their personality and interact with them often enough to create some kind of bond or connection. Typically people meet conveniently or frequently in places like Schools, Churches, At a workplace, Grocery stores, Libraries, Other public places like community centres or Rec centres. Swimming pools. Random places you visit regularly. Restaurants or coffee shops. Also, people become friends when they have things in common, similar likes, interests, desires, goals, appearances, taste in food or style. Blah blah. Etc. Etc. 

When you become more involved in things outside of your home/yourself then you begin to build bonds with anyone you interact with while participating in social affairs. If you were to join a community online and spend enough time actively engaging, you would eventually find a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù; same thing in real life. Whether they be temporary or Long term friends, simply Enjoy them for as long as they choose to be around, if they enjoy spending their Time with you and appreciate your company. As you gain and lose friends along the road in life you will learn more about what you bring to the table in friendships and be able to do whatever you want with whoever you choose to interact with. And with time you‚Äôll gain skills to be able to tell which friends are temporary and which are life long."
Parenting,fkehapy,t3_fhykmn,1584113172.0,"HOWDY... Have you tried bedtime music??? My 6yo daughter kinda can‚Äôt sleep without it now. It‚Äôs been a habit since she was 3. It only becomes annoying for me when her music turns off in the middle of the night and she yells ‚ÄúMOMMY‚Äù for me to go in her room and put it back on for her. Sometimes she turns it back on herself when she gets up to pee. I could tweak things so the music doesn‚Äôt turn off so often but at the moment I‚Äôm unfortunately a procrastinator so I won‚Äôt be doing that any time soon. It‚Äôs typically classical violin music, or her favourite, disco/funk mixes. Occasionally some Christian songs. There‚Äôs a lot of sleep music on YOUTUBE, but you could alternatively buy a radio and tune into the classical station at nights. Or your child‚Äôs favourite station. The music stays playing all night so, for me, if the music is still playing in the morning that tells me she hasn‚Äôt woken up yet. 

Bedtime music probably isn‚Äôt the best option for all children but it could be useful for a period of time. Even if it‚Äôs only a few months."

depression,fk4mvfh,t3_fghwkt,1583863574.0,"At least your hair will grow back in a few months, but this gives you an opportunity to try out a wide variety of hats..... or not. I hate to sound like an ass but you‚Äôre not the first person to get a fucked up haircut, come on now. Some people get penis accidentally tattooed on them... hopefully you‚Äôll be a strong enough human to cope with your barbers mistakes...."
