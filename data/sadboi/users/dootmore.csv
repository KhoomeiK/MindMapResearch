BipolarReddit,fpe0qev,t3_gcrsy7,1588538052.0,"30 F no mania since 2012. I am proactive and take everything very seriously. This requires acceptance. You will have this disease the rest of your life and being reactive isn't going to keep you on track. Seeing your psych and therapist very regularly are the very first steps. Even in the good times. 

This is on you. No one knows you better than you do. This disease and self-awareness go hand in hand. Knowing your triggers, knowing your symptoms, knowing your symptom progression. 

The daily routine is only part of it. Structure is vital, but only part of the ever-shifting puzzle. Bipolar disorder feeds on change. Find stability where you can in whom you can and lean into it. Good luck!"
BipolarReddit,fnsi2r8,t3_g3m4km,1587222067.0,"That's a huge jump in dose, so probably why it's hitting you so hard. Seroquel is available in 25 tabs if you're interested in going up slowly, it's a lot easier to transition. The side effects you described should yield in 2-6 weeks.

Would also recommend taking it when you're ready to go to sleep. I take mine at 10pm and wake up at 8am."
BipolarReddit,fdbyktu,t1_fdaysoh,1578263907.0,"I was extremely lethargic in the way that I couldn't move my body. I couldn't lift anything. There was visible blood in my urine and I tried three different antibiotics because urgent care thought I had a UTI. I get my lithium levels checked every 3 months and my doctor usually does other labs and that is when they noticed my elevated liver enzyme levels. My elevated calcium levels. And the strain on my kidneys. 

My mood was okay. I had a nice range of emotion on the drug. But I really thought that I had a horrible UTI. My psychiatrist worked with the other doctors at the bipolar wellneas clinic at University of Michigan where I go and they reassured me that this is extremely rare and that they have never seen a reaction like this in their personal experience. I am 30f, under 5 ft 3, 140lbs and sensitive to most medications."
BipolarReddit,fdbxgv5,t1_fdbf5aq,1578263472.0,I have blood tests done every 3 months to check my lithium levels and my doctor usually checks other vitals during these labs so this is how we caught it. My psychiatrist and family doctor looked at the results and determined that I should stop the Lamictal immediately. I had only been taking it for about 2 or 3 months at that point. Once I stopped taking it my blood work went back to normal. All of my doctors stated that this is extremely rare and something they have not observed in their own time practicing.
BipolarReddit,fdaowx1,t1_fd7jcu1,1578248553.0,"My doctor talked to me about Seroquel and abilify and gave me the choice around which one to try next. I was worried about the abilify because she said it can increase anxiety and that is something I struggle with quite a bit. I've been on the Seroquel for two full months, increasing 25 mg every 3 to 4 weeks and I'm still not at clinical therapeutic dosage levels. I would definitely be interested in trying abilify if the Seroquel doesn't pan out in the long term. 

Have you experienced increased anxiety or having too much energy with the abilify?"
BipolarReddit,fdanwzw,t3_ek7kho,1578248201.0,Thank you so much for all of the support. This is a journey I will be on for the rest of my life. I've seen so many others suffer and lose their lives to this illness. I work every day to make a life for myself and my family that is content and manageable. It's possible. It's not easy. Most people don't understand it. But with a lot of preventive work and patience for myself and the process  I'm hopeful I can have sanity for a little bit longer.
BipolarReddit,fdaks75,t1_fd9ejyp,1578247169.0,My liver began over producing enzymes. My thyroid was kicking out calcium like crazy. And what I thought was a difficult UTI was actually blood in my urine from my kidneys being overworked. There are no signs right now that any permanent damage happened.
BipolarReddit,fd6xw91,t1_fd3xed1,1578197080.0,Not eating can trigger your body to have a negative response. Especially if you're taking medication this can be extremely dangerous. Would not recommend.
BipolarReddit,fd6x9q6,t3_ek71pq,1578196866.0,Sleep is always the best thing you can do. Do you have any anxiety medication that can help you sleep? I know when I get paranoid that the mania is coming I take a very small amount of Klonopin and make sure that I am breathing correctly. Gotta get the oxygen. Also second that water is important. Never be afraid to call your doctor. They might be able to prescribe you something to help.
BipolarReddit,fd6wre9,t3_ek7clc,1578196698.0,"That is a lot of change in a short amount of time. Most medications take 6 to 8 weeks just to get in your system and then some to be fully effective. Waiting until I know I can make a strong judgment on the effectiveness of what I'm taking is always the hardest part for me.

Meds are so different for every person and every situation so it's definitely a very long process to find something that works. And even when you do find something that works it may only last for a limited amount of time. Then we move on to the next med journey.

In the end I find it's worth it for the moments that things feel right. I live for those moments. Even the tedious process of working to find the right combination is worth it to me. Mainly because I know the consequence of not trying is much much worse."
