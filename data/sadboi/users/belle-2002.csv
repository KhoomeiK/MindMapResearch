Dissociation,fqgv8nw,t3_giu9zt,1589358299.0,"counting works for me. counting how many red things in a room, people with blonde hair, etc. i avoid things like counting ceiling tiles though because it‚Äôs easy to zone out."

BPDmemes,foq68ww,t3_g8jnvx,1587984499.0,this is the most relatable thing i‚Äôve ever seen
BPD,fofgjii,t3_g6u936,1587735403.0,it‚Äôs hard to say ‚Äúi am not my disorder‚Äù when a part of your disorder is loss of sense of identity
BPD,fofggru,t3_g6utd0,1587735354.0,"DEFINITELY abuse. 
in the future, a good rule of thumb is that if you‚Äôre unsure if you‚Äôre experiencing abuse, then you probably are."
BPD,fofgafw,t3_g6uynz,1587735239.0,"yes! sometimes it feels like i‚Äôm just bits and pieces of friends, mutuals, influencers, and fictional characters i‚Äôve been exposed to more than my own person."
BPD,foffuoq,t3_g70c7g,1587734953.0,"all the time. sometimes i actually write them down, then my therapist asks if i‚Äôve been suicidal lately and i‚Äôm like idfk hahaha"
BPD,foffpdz,t3_g713tc,1587734860.0,"absolutely, if this becomes a thing that gets organized dm me please!!"

BPD,fofflob,t3_g7164z,1587734792.0,absolutely. i can‚Äôt drive because i dissociate so bad. makes life really tricky.
BPD,foffixu,t3_g71rzf,1587734744.0,yes yes yes. it‚Äôs like the angel and the devil. pretty normal but much more prominent with bpd.
BPD,foffcl4,t3_g72j99,1587734632.0,"funny how when you‚Äôre so used to being treated badly, being treated well or even normally feels like such a blessing"
BPD,foff57c,t3_g72os1,1587734501.0,this hits so fucking close to home. i always get super attached really quickly and i know it‚Äôs too much too fast but i can‚Äôt help it.
BPD,fofezzk,t3_g72wnz,1587734407.0,yes for sure. it‚Äôs one of the worst things i do in my mind. it‚Äôs exhausting. but i always have to know what‚Äôs going on in people‚Äôs lives after they‚Äôve cut me off. i hate it.
BPD,fofefxa,t3_g74ge2,1587734035.0,"yes, yes, yes. i think people with BPD just feel things a million times more intensely, so being with someone who doesn‚Äôt have BPD kind of feels like being with a zombie. you feel like they‚Äôll never feel as strongly as you do."
BPD,fofdvq4,t3_g779j1,1587733651.0,absolutely. currently trying to figure out if it‚Äôs a combination of BPD and dissociative amnesia or actual dissociative identity disorder. confusing times.
BPD,fofa120,t3_g70ov2,1587730791.0,hits so hard. some old friends used this all the time. i couldn‚Äôt say anything without them saying something about it being my bpd. it was tough but i don‚Äôt associate with them anymore.

BPDmemes,f6n5bih,t3_ds29s0,1572985026.0,fucking true. cutting off all contact with someone and waiting for them to find a way to find you. also when you mute somebody but constantly check to see if they‚Äôve said anything.
BPD,f6n4kam,t3_drxby5,1572984658.0,i don‚Äôt even know me
