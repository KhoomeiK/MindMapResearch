AskReddit,fj4nu11,t3_fb2bve,1583012630.0,"I was sitting at a restaurant by myself at a four top, this lady comes in and asked if she could sit at my table. I say sure, because it was crowded and she was an older woman. She starts telling me about how she was supposed to go meet her sister, but she didn't like the food where they were meeting, so she wanted to get a quick lunch somewhere she liked, but she never flags down the waitress to order. We chatted about the normal things, weather, errands, etc... about fifteen minutes of conversation.

My appetizer shows up shortly after, this woman starts sharing my appetizer without so much as a thanks. I am patient and I never eat the whole thing, so i let it go. So far she still seems mostly normal. My meal arrives and this woman, who still hadn't ordered anything herself,  asked if hers was almost ready and that it is incredibly rude to bring out one person's meal, but not the other. The waitress looks at me, I look at the waitress and we both have that look of WTAF?

So she asks the woman what she had ordered, she says, ""oh I don't know, whatever you people are serving today, I don't write the menu."" The waitress goes to get the manager and by this time the woman starts talking to herself. Asking and answering her own questions, looking at me and then looking over her shoulder and saying, ""I don't know, I didn't invite him."" 


The manager comes out and asks if he can get her order, she says, ""No, you tell that girl do her own job, you have your own work to do."" The manager looks at me, I by this time look completely exasperated. The manager hoes in back and calls the cops, I am just about done with my meal as they arrive and ask me how I know her. I tell them she literally walked in and asked to share my table, that was all. 

So it turns out, she was a patient in a nearby care facility that wandered off during some outdoor recreation. She had dementia and mild schizoaffective disorder, so she just went somewhere she recognized. I'm just glad she didn't get to follow me anywhere else."
