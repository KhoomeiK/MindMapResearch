Eminem,fr4xv9l,t3_gme4jf,1589898935.0,"Darkness is the best track on the album, and its message -- both as a song and a music video -- is extraordinarily effective. I do think Eminem is having his cake and eating it, too -- he's created some extraordinarily violent raps that definitely promote aggression and gun violence, so I can see how people could misinterpret his intentions. That said, it works so well as a narrative, and the double entendres are effective.

I think there are two reasons Darkness didn't generate a ton of controversy: YouTube basically shut it down in terms of accessibility (given that it could very easily trigger anyone with PTSD, either from the Mandalay Bay shooting or as a result of some form of gun violence); and by mid-March, nobody was talking about this album anymore. Everyone was focused on this fucking insane pandemic, the health hazards and economic fallout. Literally every other political issue fell by the wayside. 

Not to mention, Eminem's most popular songs are the ones that have poppier elements -- Godzilla, Love the Way You Lie, Rap God, Without Me, The Real Slim Shady, The Monster. I'm surprised the Ed Sheeran cut on this album didn't resonate with people more for this exact reason."
Eminem,fr4wyxg,t3_gmhxn3,1589898455.0,"I know it's recent, and I once felt this way about Evil Twin, but I Will is just so sick.

But overall, the best closer is probably Criminal or Still Don't Give a Fuck. With each of those songs, it's like he took all the rage from the previous album tracks, condensed them into five psychotic, rapid-fire minutes, and pulled absolutely no punches while giving exactly zero fucks."

""Because, you see, the world had done  its worst. What harm was left to be done? What remained to fear? What  was left to lose that I could not survive? I felt extraordinarily  liberated by this, protected by the calamity itself and perversely  invincible within my own vulnerability.

AskReddit,fr11xms,t3_glr6jd,1589811657.0,"No. I think there’s a huge potential for interactive media, and certain games have touched upon aspects of “high art” or thought-provoking subject matter, but nothing narratively or in terms of experience comes close to literature. For what it’s worth, though I think movies are more accessible, they rarely achieve the insights that good literature consistently produces. The most significant visual stories — in terms of providing deep dives into psychological and societal concepts - are The Sopranos, Casablanca, Apocalypse Now, Children of Men, Alexander Payne’s movies, and To Kill a Mockingbird (like Children of Men and some Payne movies, an adaptation of a book). As far as video games, some lines from Max Payne still stick with me, but come on - it’s really just eight to ten hours of blasting criminals with various weaponry and watching bodies become disfigured in really graphic ways.

That said, there is potential for interactive media to provide psychological relief or express artistic interpretation. Frankly, there would probably have to be less emphasis on “gameplay” - action, puzzle-solving, gaining experience points, collecting coins or stars, etc. I’ve seen (but not played) games like Flower and Minecraft, those seem to come closest. But they also lack narratives."

U2 used to be my favorite band. But the last few years ... their optimism just doesn't resonate anymore. I'm starting to feel that way about Springsteen, too.

The band saw Joshua Tree as something very politically relevant 30 years after its release, worth revisiting. I see the ""multimedia"" aspect of ZooTV being relevant to the current culture, but not as socially urgent."

U2Band,fnvfl2l,t3_g3r20l,1587291448.0,"I’ve been listening to a lot of Bruce Springsteen during this crisis, especially his album The Rising and his newest record, Western Stars. Some really gentle, reflective songs on that latest one; I dare you not to feel calm after listening to Hello Sunshine. Other songs that make you want to fight back: Darkness on the Edge of Town, Reason to Believe, Land of Hope and Dreams.

U2’s All That You Can’t Leave Behind contains many mature songs about resilience and accepting the world as it is, painful though it may be. Walk On, Stuck in a Moment, When I Look at the World, Peace on Earth, Grace. 

Probably the most recent, relevant track they’ve released is 13 (There is a Light) — a sort of prayer for finding hope during dark times. 

Of course, Achtung Baby’s One has been on my mind a lot, too - though it’s probably the most obvious choice: “Is it getting better? Or do you feel the same? ... One love. One life. When it’s one need in the night ... We get to carry each other ... I can’t be holding on when all you’ve got is hurt.” We really do need to help one another if our species is going to get through this, or life in general.

Often, U2’s songs are about how love and unity guide us through our darkest moments ... the problem in this scenario is that so many of us are all alone. I think Springsteen is the better option given the circumstances, and frankly I’ve listened to him a lot more often these past few lonely, heartbreaking years. 

These are insanely rough times, no matter who you are, where you are, or what you’re facing. Nobody has answers as to when, or if, things will get back to normal. Try to be kind to yourself. I’m working really hard at that, and not doing such a great job."

I've been having a hard time dealing with this pandemic -- as has everyone else -- but he's an example that there are still good people out there in the world. I'll try to remember that as I move forward."

After sharing your wisdom and guidance back in 2013, I ended up working for NBCUniversal for seven years -- and my Olympics team and I won a Sports Emmy during that time. Thanks always, John -- and hope you're well. Trying to pay the good fortune forward. Best, Dan"

And I’ve stopped eating, down to maybe one meal a day and some alcohol. So I’m actually losing weight, which doesn’t exactly make me want to exercise again."
