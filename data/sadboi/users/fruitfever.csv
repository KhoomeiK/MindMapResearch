PornAddiction,fqt5ecc,t3_gkpeku,1589630513.0,"hello! i've been in a similar situation as you, just that i'm not married to my partner lol. i see you don't feel the need to quit which is a huge blockage towards stopping this addiction. if you don't see a reason to stop, then you won't stop. it was like that for me. my partner always told me i have a porn addiction but i just thought it was ... nothing like that. i thought i had my freedom to watch porn whenever i like. of course my partner felt hurt because i started to decline sexually with him and hide away how much i watched porn, what porn i liked and i lied to him for some time saying i haven't watched porn for months even though i did. i want you to understand your partner a little better. she is asking this question for a reason. she sees how porn rules your life and the fact that you can't stop shows you are addicted. now you wonder, how do i get out of this addiction? what helped me and i think many others is to look at the root of the addiction. what caused it? i have started looking at porn around your age as well. have you been abused? have you just been browsing the web? has someone exposed you to sex/porn at that age? for me, i was abused at home physically as well as emotionally. i was exposed to my parents making out right in front of me as i shut my eyes in fear of not knowing what is happening. and copied it with my kindergarten friends. that started my sexual awakening, sort of. i then escaped to the internet at the age of 6-7. i was looking around for sexual videos, but never found porn until 8-10 years old. maybe you can recall something that happened to you that could explain all of this? memories can be hard to recall, but maybe when you look into the symptoms of this disorder, maybe find a therapist as well to accompany and help you, you can discover yourself better and find what truly caused this addiction and get better effectively. if you love your wife, talk to her. communicate your thoughts to her. ask her for help and also ask her how she feels. i'm here if you need help okay? good luck"
PornAddiction,fqt492u,t3_gkrwlr,1589629462.0,"please know that there are SOOOO many healthy solutions to this where you don't have to do these things to yourself. i know how you feel. i also feel ashamed for this porn addiction but i can confirm to you that people understand. it's not your fault you get laughed at, it's the ignorance of others. you CLEARLY want to get better, you want to stop so badly you want to even do bad things to yourself but listen. wouldn't it be much better if you decided to live healthily and to move on from porn in an effective way? you can keep your genitalia and still be porn free, i promise. i recommend for you to look deeper into your addiction, when it started and what it started from. maybe you were abused and seeked out serotonin from porn. maybe you were peer pressured. maybe you were innocently browsing the web. once you see when it started and why, you can build up to understanding yourself better and what you need to do to get away from porn. for me, i started when i was under 10 years old, and continued until recently. it influenced my life and the relationships i have with others in particular really badly. but i'm one month porn free!!! and that is thanks to understanding and see how much the symptoms resonate with me and how they made my life harder/worse. but your life doesn't end here. i see you try so hard and i see you wish for it so bad but something is stopping you. try to maybe see a therapist? not only do you have a porn addiction but you also have self harming tendencies, which i think you should get treatment for. look for psychotherapists in your area or near it who specialize in sex and addiction or both. i wish you the best of luck. if you need help, i'm here and you can message me."
PornAddiction,fq5ihfs,t3_ggg55b,1589106690.0,"you need to really tell him how much this hurts you more because i think otherwise he will not be able to understand. i promise you you are valid for your feelings and not alone! but i also promise you you are not at fault. i'm a porn addict and i made my boyfriend feel unsexy and unwanted as well many times because of this addiction. it makes sense that you feel this way and you are allowed to demand complete transparency from him for how much he masturbates and what he masturbates to. it can be a difficult journey but i bet you guys can do this. try to show him porn addict symptoms, try to really get it in his head how bad this is and how it shows the negatively impact the relationship not only for you guys, but for me and for SO many others. if you need help i'm here, okay? you can dm me. good luck with everything!"
LongDistance,fq4irn2,t1_fq2nri3,1589078291.0,thank you so much for your great advice :( i do know that my insecurities stem from childhood trauma and i also have bpd because of said trauma which makes things really hard for me to deal with at times emotionally because i always feel like i'll be abandoned by my boyfriend everyday. it sucks but i'm pushing through and he's also pushing through and supporting me well and i think the best i can do is to just seek out help as well as communicate with him. lots of love ♥️
LongDistance,fq0pdw7,t1_fq0k5yz,1589035519.0,"we do communicate allllooottt and it really does help us but i just still feel like i'm ... just giving him boring things to talk about 😢 but i know that i have to just work on my insecurities. i feel like i have to perform for him alot and do fun things every second when i don't even have the energy for it alot :( he tells me i don't have to ever and he loves me regardless but i feel like i'm boring him to death still 😞 regardless. i'm so happy that it works out for you and your partner!!! thank you for your suggestions, i'm absolutely noting them down. lots of love ♥️"
BPD,fq00ie2,t3_gg5eat,1589026307.0,i'm here if you want to talk. i promise you will recover and feel better than ever. lots of love ♥️
PornAddiction,fpzwbgk,t3_gga5vj,1589024650.0,"i think it would be great if you slept at night. it can trigger alot of people (the last time i relapsed was at night as well) because then you're alone with your thoughts alot and nobody is there to distract you other than yourself. try to maybe punch your pillows, get some ice and watch it melt on your hand, talk to yourself about something you like etc. these methods are usually for when people self harm but i think it's worth looking into because after all it brings one purpose: to distract yourself from doing something bad to yourself. make a list of why you shouldn't relapse and what it will do for you and revisit it when you feel urges to masturbate. look at it when night starts and read it out loud if you can to really get the negatives of relapsing in your head. that will keep you away from porn better as you have reminded yourself of the cons more. good luck! if you need help you can message me!"
PornAddiction,fpvyqds,t3_gfl66a,1588954223.0,"hello! first off i want to say i'm really proud of you for finding out that you have a porn addiction and want to get better, that's a great step to improvement. i've been in your place too. my porn taste was getting way more complex and violent and it became something i relied on so much for satisfaction. i think the best you can do to stop your addiction is to truly see which symptoms of porn addiction resonate with you the most, as well as what causes you resonate with. as you understand yourself better, you understand the addiction better and see a clearer way to not be a porn addict anymore. i'm here if you have any questions! you got this. good luck"
PornAddiction,fpvx3ut,t3_gfq31m,1588953396.0,"your partner should bring you support and love but it truly kind of depends on you the most to talk about your urges, bring honesty and when you relapse or feel like relapsing to talk about it in detail and figure out why those feelings occured to prevent it from happening again. she can offer you insight and comfort and can also help you discover yourself sexually in a healthy way"
PornAddiction,fpvwr9o,t3_gfpbyh,1588953219.0,"i've had relationship issues as well because of porn addiction and have had suicidal thoughts like you as well. my partner also broke up with me because of the lies i have fabricated connected to my porn addiction and so on (we're back together but it was hard for my partner obviously). i hope you know you're absolutely NOT a bad person and you feeling guilt and so on shows that you truly want to get better, and you can. i know it's so hard right now, but take me as an example! i've been going porn free for over two weeks now, and it feels amazing. the more you keep on, the happier you will be. and i promise you with hard work and complete honesty towards the person you love you can get them back again as well. you have to understand that dealing with a partner who has a porn addiction can be alot. it all kind of depends on you, and i know it's alot right now but you got this, i promise. i'm here if you need help. good luck."
PornAddiction,fpnat7z,t3_ge046g,1588756297.0,"it's okay if you're not vanilla but i do think that a porn addiction does kinda fuck with your taste in sexual things because you are addicted, and not really ""in the right mind"". i have been porn free for a couple weeks and now looking back i feel insanely disgusting for having masturbated to the things i have watched, and in no way do i find sexual pleasure in it. porn addiction is, like it says right there, a literal addiction that makes you crave more complex porn to fuel it, just like when you're addicted to literal drugs, you start craving more complex, more dangerous ones. i cannot explain why it does that to the brain but it does. i don't think you actually enjoy the things you enjoyed in porn, but you probably haven't had time to sexually discover yourself enough, especially because you are so young. i wish you the best of luck with everything"
BPD,fp0h8xc,t1_fp0h02l,1588209227.0,i was thinking the same thing!!! but because i don't see anyone talk about this stuff i'm kinda doubting myself? is not physically but mentally/psychologically self harming in this way a thing? hmmmm
PornAddiction,fp0e3pr,t3_gagftp,1588207496.0,"i'm also addicted to porn and have the same issue as you. i can't get off without porn, and i'm around your age, having been watching half my life as well. i think the best thing you can do is to sort of educate yourself on porn addiction. that helps you to see the consequences it brings and that lets you see why you would want to stop. because if you just see you have an addiction, but  not the issues it brings, it's kinda hard to convince yourself on why to stop. try to maybe note the consequences down or watch lots of videos on it. i'm also here if you need help. good luck!"
BPD,foar521,t3_g6m6dn,1587651156.0,wow i looked through it now too and i feel so damn horrible
BPD,fml6mjf,t3_fvuc8f,1586179898.0,i'm the exact opposite and i start to show all my symptoms even more and it seems to get worse by time
PornAddiction,fm1d7t1,t3_fsaq9u,1585676298.0,"wow, i relate to all of these things except sexual abuse. ever since i was a child in kindergarden i was fascinated with everything sexual, and i would literally be sexual with other children. i was always isolated from everyone and everything because my parents are overly protective in a very abusive and pressuring way. they would also just overall physically abuse me and threaten to hit me, tell me to shut up when i was sad. emotional abuse was huge, which i think led me to hide away from them even more and get serotonin from something else. my first relationship was a long distance relationship with a 16 year old pedophile (i was 13). i don't wanna go in depth about this but i do think if you have shitty relationships with everyone in your life from a young age, you begin to fall apart and if you have an early exposure to porn, then that's what ""puts you back together"" and becomes your only satisfaction. it kinda blends together."
PornAddiction,fm1bw5t,t1_flvyrux,1585675627.0,"thank you so much for the great advice! <3 since i've realized all of this i've noticed how hard it is to stay ""sober"". it's odd. also, i don't really know what i'm truly into cause i have no experience overall (he is my first partner who i have have sex with). i think porn distorted it alot for me too which sucks. but i'll keep trying!"
PornAddiction,fm1attr,t1_fm11sv0,1585675091.0,this is extremely helpful. thank you so so much! :)
BPD,flu7tzi,t1_flu7dex,1585497096.0,"it's very common for girls but definitely less talked about, for some reason, which sucks :/ also i get that, but also i feel really bad for having had this addiction because it makes things way less intimate and like you said, emotional? i wish i could experience sexual situations like a ""normal"" person ..."
BPD,flu6wq4,t1_flu6gbq,1585496535.0,same!!! i was guessing it can be more common for people with bpd to have it because we tend to have unhealthy relationships or connections towards sexual stuff
PornAddiction,flu5xpa,t1_flu5a3c,1585495932.0,"i have been thinking about online therapy alot actually, and i guess that's the only thing i could do right now. thank you for the suggestion! :) i wish you the best of luck with everything!"
PornAddiction,flu5k1g,t1_flu4x5s,1585495697.0,thank you very much! do you have any suggestions where i can find such things?
BPD,fjgs4kl,t3_fd8n1v,1583334334.0,"okay. i think this will be a bit controversial. but i think people tend to forget there are for example teenagers who grow up with parents who continuously abuse them and scare them to be getting professional help, or deny giving the child any help for therapy for example. this was the case for me. after years of self diagnosing i tried to approach my mother about how i feel bad everyday. she wanted to beat me up, accused me of being ungrateful and threatened to kill herself if i didn't stop bringing up my mental problems. 

if someone notices symptoms, has been doing extensive research for a longer time on the mental disorder and can relate to it in many ways, that is not a good sign, and it should not be ignored. 

however, if someone, even after being able to get help and getting away from an abusive household for example, doesn't want to get professionally diagnosed and stays self diagnosed... that is not acceptable. if you CAN get help, GET IT. if you can't, don't ignore what you're going through. that's what i think."
BPD,fhzzhj8,t3_f5p5ib,1582019155.0,"oh god i'm so sorry that happened to you. i honestly would've been so angry if that happened to me, especially if my boyfriend would've still stayed friends with a person like that."
BPD,fhiuai1,t3_f3gzvk,1581631967.0,"i feel you so much!!! it seems like everyone around me can just somehow verbalize their thoughts but that takes so much effort for me because not only do i overthink, i also have to think of a right way to say what i want to say. a good way to put a sentence together. it's so frustrating... especially when everyone around you doesn't understand things like this at all, and everytime i did tell others about this they just told me to ""be less shy"" ... it has nothing to do with being shy for me, i just can't articulate myself well enough. and it sucks even more when a topic pops up that you're pretty passionate about or know alot of, and you just sit there and want to participate but can't because of these issues..... sigh"
BPD,fhh5vvj,t3_f36wkb,1581594906.0,"yessssssss. all the time.

i notice every little mood swing of mine and i'm immediately reactive to it. like, ""oh god please not now"" when i start to feel bad for no reason. mainly though i analyse the moods of my boyfriend because he's the most important person in my life to me and my mood depends on his alot which is really shitty. basically i see a change in tone or words he uses and i start to panic and feel low because i assume he's not feeling good. and that triggers my mood swings ALOT. if he uses a ""good"" tone i feel safe and energized. i know what he sounds like when he gets sad but i overanalyzed it so much and now i'm constantly fearful of ruining his mood and that affects me alot :("
BPD,fhh54yn,t3_f35wup,1581594081.0,"i get you so much. a couple years ago there was a guy in my class that played us sad songs on the piano for music class, and i wasn't necessarily sad but... super distressed and scared the entire day because of it? i was restless and when i had to walk home i felt so terrified. i have certain songs that just make me cry immediately too, and i love them but i have to avoid them alot so i don't get really depressed. there's certain songs i replay in my head alot for some reason when my life is falling apart too? not too long ago i was in class suddenly thinking about one of those songs and i literally was crying. really hard. but i mastered the arts of hiding it in public pretty well so nobody noticed lol"
