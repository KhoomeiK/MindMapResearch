Playing a homogenous game of any kind would be so strange because that's the furthest thing from my reality.

thesims,fqy1jb5,t3_gldriu,1589741086.0,"The **Education System Bundle** from **Kawaii** **Stacie** is one of my favs because it allows kids/teens to gain skills from school and homework. Students can also take online classes and you can send toddlers away to pre-school where they will gain skills. This mod + clubs has made skill gaining for the townie youth a breeze.  B) B)

I also love **Seriously Sims Cooking Overhaul.** It unlocks all EA recipes, includes and provides support for custom recipes, allows you to access the cupcake machine menu from an oven and SO much more. Really makes cooking fun as heck in the Sims! 

**Meaningful Stories** by **Roburky** is also cool because it makes the emotion system more realistic. It's integrates very well with the game and is a must for me at this point."

Naturalhair,fq7bjy2,t3_ggxag4,1589144267.0,"There is only one method of shaving that has not produced razor bumps for me but it's incredibly time consuming lol. 

1. Before shaving  make sure to trim as much as possible.
2.  Wash/exfoliate the area with a wash cloth or body scrub. 
3. Warm up the area with a warm, moist wash cloth before applying a moisturizing shaving gel. 
4. Run the razor under warm water before shaving each section. Shake of excess water before shaving. (I've heard that you need to shave in the direction of the hair to prevent bumps but honestly, that doesn't work for me. I shave against the grain slowly, while pulling the skin taught so I don't have to do as many passes)
5.  The Barbasol Ultra 6 Plus has given me the cleanest shave and is now the only razor I use down there.
6.  After shaving I wash and exfoliate the area again, dry off , then apply a dab of Eucerin intensive down there. 
7. Once the moisturizer rub a little deodorant down there. Like a swipe on each side of the bikin line and across the mons pubis  


My body hair is fine, coarse and wavy + my skin seems pretty thick. Like, my leg hair doesn't grow past the surface of my skin without heavy exfoliation every single day lol. I'm a prime candidate for razor bumps so I've had to be really particular about my shaving methods. After doing the above mentioned ""procedure"", my bikini area has been silky smooth and bump free for the first time in years. I also get the closest shave when I do it this way.

**Tl;dr-- Trim frist. Exfoliate & clean before and after shaving. Make sure to warm up the area before shaving! Keep the razor blade warm.**"

Truthfully, I started rocking long sleeves consistently since I was a teen so my body had learned to acclimate in warm temperatures. At this point people asking about scars is more exhausting than embarrassing so it‚Äôs been easier to not give a flying fuck (compared to when I was younger)

Swimming is one of the few pure joys I get in life so I will NOT let anyone‚Äôs curiosity ruin that for me. The time you spend at the beach/pool with folks you enjoy will be far longer than the time it takes for some dumbass to ask ‚ÄúdID yOu cUT UrSeLF???‚Äù so be mindful of that. Remember, no one is entitled to the history of your traumas or insecurities but people are people so they‚Äôre still going to gawk and ask. it‚Äôs okay to be flustered every now and again because we‚Äôre also human. When people pointed my scars out I used to get very, very angry but now I explain that it‚Äôs rude to ask about something so obvious for the sake of curiosity.

The doctors I work with and those in our network are also trained and certified in skeletal radiology, physiology and sports medicine. Some are former orthopedic physicians/surgeons, some were GP's who transitioned to chiropractic and I know of former physical therapy/sports medicine professors and professionals who've become chiropractors as well. I've been around the block and know there are some kooky chiropractors out there but there are also some solid, well trained ones as well. The issue with chiropractic is not the study or science, it's the lack of uniformed regulation within the specialty.

I realize that if I'm really particular with washing/conditioning it makes styling a lot easier throughout the week so I now wash with a moisturizing shampoo 2-3x a month, regular condition 2x a month, deep condition 2x a month and clarify shampoo 1x a month. I also spritz my hair and scalp with warm water, aloe and a lil bit of leave in throughout the week to refresh my coils and that helps a bunch. 

Tbh I haven't detangled since I shaved my head in september lol. I just finger detangle/massage the strands when I condition and leave it at that.  I probably won't use a comb/detangling brush until I get more length. 

Also do you use any gels or curl enhancing products?"
Naturalhair,fcs3qb5,t1_fcs1te6,1577911023.0,"Oh lawd, don't get me started on skin care lol! My coworker is one of those ""I scrub my face with dove and use body lotion on my face sometimes"" type of people and her skin is FLAWLESS. Whereas without a strict regiment my pimples would get pimples and my skin would crumble to dust smh. But word, I'm excited to learn more about my hair and body in the coming months and years. B) I hope the journey continues to be fun for you as well. Ps-- I love your glasses and your fro is so cute! Makes me eager for that summer wash and go."
Naturalhair,fcs1608,t1_fcrzir0,1577909811.0,"Big facts!! Every time I see coconut oil as recc I hiss because I now know it isn't for me. But before learning about my hair I was bitterly and blindly sipping the hair care kool-aid lol. Def gotta lean into the individuality and desires of our curls and coils-- but like you said, it's a process.  Anything worth having is worth the effort though!"
Naturalhair,fcrz242,t3_eimcb7,1577908699.0,"Happy New Years! I have low porosity, high density, fine coarse hair and finally have a pretty solid routine after all these years of being natural lmao. What are you curious about exactly?"
Naturalhair,fcryupc,t1_fcoolvr,1577908581.0,"SO true!!! I used to be a lil bitter about my 4c hair because I thought genetic predisposition was the ..root of my hair problems. SIKE. I learned about all the things you mentioned and finally found a routine + products that work for my hair and it's environment. It seems like my hair is growing faster than ever before but in reality, I'm just not losing as much because my strands are healthy. B) B) So yeah, do your research and don't give up just because someone's genes is doing something a lil different than yours."
Naturalhair,fcrxaow,t3_eijb3d,1577907896.0,"I started using the Emu Oil Fro Butter a few months ago when I was doing crochet braids/twists out etc. because I felt like straight oils just weren't cutting it for me. I shaved my head in September so now I just use it to grease my scalp and edges. The fro butter has been a godsend. It's light, smooth and sinks into your hair quickly. I use it before bed maybe 2-3x a week and my hair feels so much softer why I wake up. My mom used to grease my hair with Dax as a kid and my hair was pretty healthy. I don't know why or when I shunned grease from my routine smh. 

I'm 4c, low porosity. I'm hooked on fro butter because it's scalp friendly and won't produce buildup. The only other new age grease I tried was carol's daughters mimosa honey pomade and it didn't do a TING for me beside smell nice. It was also very stiff and hard to work with. Anyway I'm on the east coast and my hair is feeling summer soft rn B)"
BPD,f9sv50t,t3_e6rj9e,1575601315.0,"I blame both of my parents and my brother to some extent. I think my mom had BPD as she had a severely traumatic childhood and that coupled with a shitty marriage, poverty and post partum depression made her withdrawn, mean/violent at times when I was a kid. I see a lot of myself in her to be honest. My father on the other hand was more mild mannered but pretty disconnected. I don't think he REALLY wanted kids. My mom wanted kids because she wanted a family + wanted someone to love her unconditionally and my father wanted kids because he wanted someone to look up to him/value him. 

Growing up I was responsible for my moms emotional needs so she leaned on me A LOT but she would also yell at me/beat me at times. My parents also loved that I never talked back so I grew up feeling like I didn't matter. My father was more attentive to my brother but my brother who I have always adored pretty much hated me/was disgusted with me until our late teens/early twenties. I felt engulfed by my moms emotions/her condition, ignored by my father and unaccepted by my brother throughout childhood but the biggest joke is that I loved them all to pieces-- I just wanted them to love and acknowledge me. 

I resented my parents for a LONG time, especially my mom just because I felt so burdened by her emotions. Our relationship improved in my later teens because she realized that there are things I don't need to know/acknowledged how dysfunctional my childhood was. She was also the only in one in my family who took the time to research and understand my mental illness. In many ways she became an advocate for my mental health and before she turned into a vegetable she was taking steps to address her own emotional/mental issues as well. I told her that I loved her a day or two before she had her aneurysm and I fucking meant it. With my Dad, I realize now that he is who he is. He's not a bad guy but I know that he will never be the father I've needed him to be-- attentive, nurturing, thoughtful understanding etc. And that's okay, I guess. I've set up very clear emotional boundaries with him and since I know what to expect, I don't feel as much resentment these days."
thesims,f7uyyc8,t1_f7un3k0,1574019204.0,You can start a new household with a teen though!
thesims,f7ufgd1,t3_dxobuq,1574014288.0,While they are a teen you can use grades.promote high school until they get an A. And if they were an A student in grade school they‚Äôll start off high school as B student. If you age down a young adult to give them an A in high school they‚Äôll start off with a F or a D.  Hope that helps!

Sims4,eqhhp1k,t1_eqgmm59,1560059296.0,damn thats wild. i can't even imagine playing w/o parenthood at this point. i think it's the one pack that actually enhances game play (minus free toddlers update lmao).
anime,epd8chn,t1_epayrts,1559163135.0,"Hmm well I definitely enjoy seeing Saitama on screen the most but I am interested in Garou's and Genos's development. With Suiryu, he seems like a character that the viewers should be invested in but he kinda just came outta nowhere. Idk! You may be right, lol. I'm still riding on the wave of how season 1 made me feel."
solotravel,ep7nijk,t3_bu0ek0,1559084039.0,"New Yorker here‚Äî Oct-November is actually the best time to visit the city because there isn‚Äôt a huge influx of tourists and transplants are usually traveling out of the city. This means that the city is comfortably busy. And depending on when you come in November you‚Äôll get to see lots of yellow/orange leaves. Weather wise it normally pretty cool in November like high 40‚Äôs to low 60‚Äôs depending on the day. Last two weeks of November tend to be a shit show with turkey day, Black Friday, folks coming back home for the holidays and that weird snow storm we always seem to have in Nov. 

Activity wise‚Äî I do a lot of stuff solo in the city all the time. The good thing about coming in Nov. is that you can still enjoy outdoor activities like visiting prospect/central park, hiking in the palisades or walking the high line, smorgasbord etc. Art galleries tend to be in full swing from late August-mid November if that‚Äôs your things. This is when a lot of museum release new exhibits so there‚Äôs that as well. There are also a ton of free events year round (movies, parties, etc)  so your trip doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be expensive.

Tl;dr New York is great for solo travel and you‚Äôre more than likely going to meet someone at some point traveling under similar circumstances!"
anime,ep74yvu,t1_ep6ngg3,1559077391.0,not at all!! the whole time i was thinking.. is saitama taking a shit AGAIN? WHERE HE AT?? I don't think this seasons is one to watch week by week either. I feel like I would've been less pissed if I waited like 10 eps before watching.
anime,ep747hn,t1_ep6pafs,1559077114.0,"omg, when i found out JC staff as doing OPM i was so confused. I could've sworn their strength was shojo/SOL/anything that is NOT action lmao"
anime,ep73pk0,t1_ep71wdy,1559076933.0,"right?? meanwhile, garou clenches his fist at watchdog.. then 15 minutes later.. garou attacks but watchdog STRONG. watch dog FAST. idk i feel like most of suiryu's development happened in the end of the previous episode and in the like the last 5 min of this episode..."
anime,ep72z69,t1_ep6s9ff,1559076666.0,yeah i was like .. serious saitama is now bishounen saitama???
anime,ep6tgki,t3_bu3lki,1559073355.0,"this episode was okay. i was really, REALLY hoping to see saitama fight but perhaps that'll be next episode.. for 30 seconds max.. and then back to showing every other damn character in the show growing and fighting. at this point i think i'm just going to hold off until the season is finished because my heart can't take the stupid pacing and cliffhangers. 

&#x200B;

also i'm not reading manga or webcomic but i've seen a few posts saying that saitama won't really be a big part of this season?? can anyone confirm so i can adjust my expectations lmao"
