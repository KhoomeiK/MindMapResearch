I would caution against measuring yourself by external standards of success. It took me going through the diagnosis and management of some chronic physical issues and subsequent inability to do the same kind of work that I did before to realize that I had to believe in my inherent worth absent a well-paying job, absent the certainty that I was ""living up to my potential.""

BPD,fr00591,t3_glfgi4,1589779934.0,"I think it's super normal to want your partner to be somewhat involved in planning an exciting and meaningful day in your lives together. I don't think you have anything to fix in this instance, honestly, I think you just need to be direct with your partner. Planning a wedding is truly a ton of work! I get decision fatigue and also have issues with anxious avoidance of important stuff, and I very gladly let my mom have her way with the whole thing. She put on an amazing Batman & Hello Kitty themed wedding, bless her.

But when she asked for input, I gave it to her. I responded, I thanked, I encouraged.

Your feelings are valid. And I think you could verbalize them in a way that is both kind and direct. In a moment when you aren't in your feelings, and when you have his attention, tell him that you are so excited to start this new chapter of your lives together, and you want to make sure that the wedding reflects a blending of your lives. It's not just about you, it's about the both of you, your families, your friends. And if he is agreeable to that, you could try showing him a few things that you like, and he can help you choose out of those options. Hell, it wouldn't kill him to be a bit proactive about helping you manage the wedding planning. You could make a list breaking down the mechanics of planning a wedding, and see if there aren't some items on that list that he can't take the lead on. 

The shame of having a ""negative"" feeling can really make me spin out, trying to figure out how it is my fault. Because obviously if I am feeling a bad feeling, then it is someone's fault, and it's easy to just extrapolate that it's my own fault for being too needy, too much, too difficult. But a lot of the time, the sudden intensity of my emotions is so distressing on its own that I don't see the valid need behind the feels.

I wish you so much kindness, grace, and flexibility toward yourself."

Treating the symptoms without also identifying and working on those core issues was a losing battle for me. Once I recognized the connection, I could start being more mindful when I feel the impulse to be validated starts feeling uncomfortable. We all want to be recognized for our human contributions in some way, but when my desire to be validated corresponds with an uptick in my bodily symptoms of anxiety (tension in my shoulders, tightness in my chest, general unease, and intense feelings of urgency, etc), that's a check engine light. Only unlike a car, I do kinda know my way around my brain. I don't like it in there, and it's painful to take a look at the faulty wiring, but it's necessary maintenance. In an ideal world, I would really love to go back to seeing a licensed mechanic about some of the more complex issues there, but in the meantime all I can do is stop, breathe, be direct about what's happening to the people around me (if I can't leave the room and/or if the feelings are super intense and I know it shows on my face), and do the work of managing my mental illness in real time.

AmItheAsshole,flodt0v,t3_fpv21h,1585336361.0,"NTA 

I have borderline personality disorder and fibromyalgia (and a bunch of associated issues). Socially, I'm very open about my various illnesses and will discuss my diagnoses, the treatments I've been through, what works for me, what has made things worse... basically I'm an open book. At my current job, my direct manager is aware of my health issues and I am blessed beyond measure that my workplace is incredibly flexible with my needs.

But my diagnoses will never, ever make an appearance on any of my professional application materials.

In the US, it is illegal to make a hiring decision based on a candidate's ADA protected illness. So for legal, cover-your-ass purposes, pre-emptively announcing your health issues puts you AND the employer at an immediate disadvantage. Here's why:

A) Even though it is ILLEGAL, it is very, VERY difficult to prove that an employer didn't hire you **because of your illness** if you tell them before they've made an offer. If you wait until you have a job offer in hand, you are much better positioned to pursue legal action if they withdraw your job offer after being informed of your illness. 

B) The hiring manager may have a subconscious bias toward people with your illness, and may dismiss your resume for that outright. You may be thinking, ""well, I don't want to work for a company that won't be supportive of my health needs."" This is true, but see the next point.

C) Having your illness listed on your resume puts the employer in a sticky situation, even if they ARE generally supportive of employees with health issues. Because even if they decide against hiring you for a completely legal, ethical reason, you could possibly try to sue them for discrimination. You might not win, but the liability is there because you supplied your health information up front.

The best protection for you AND the employer is to only disclose ADA protected health issues **once an offer has been made.**

I would direct your friend to the advice blog www.askamanager.org, which is where I learned most of this information. I'm so, so pleased to hear that your friend is doing so well with his mental health management and has a great support network. And I'm really glad you shared this here. This stuff is REALLY tough to navigate, so those of us with Health Stuff need all the resources we can get."

But I only recently reintroduced their eye cream into my nightly routine (I will list below) because I'm in my 30's so it feels like it's That Time, but also because it feels nice, and also because when I use it at night, in the morning my makeup does seem to go on more smoothly (more on that below also)

Skin Routine:
D A Y 
‚Ä¢ COSRX One Step Original Clear Pads
SO gentle, and SO effective. I've used this product for probably over a year now, and daily use seems to keep most of my cystic acne at Bay without any increased redness or irritation. 

‚Ä¢ COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence
I picked this up at the same time I started the FAB AHA. I had used the Advanced Snail 92 Cream as a lighter daytime cream, and I liked that so much I figured I'd look into the more concentrated essence. It also replaced my COSRX Hyaluronic Acid serum, which I had really liked. But this essence, I LOVE. It feels wonderful to apply, plays well with the FAB AHA (doesn't pill or separate, etc), has nodiscernable scent, sinks into skin fairly quickly, and my skin seems to maintain moisture and hasn't been as inflamed or irritated.

‚Ä¢ COSRX Hyaluronic Acid Intensive Cream
I've been using this for over 6 months I think, and it is wonderful! It isn't irritating, hasn't caused me to break out, and doesn't have a scent at all to me. I started out using this on as a night cream only, because it feels a bit thicker. But I've since started applying a thinner layer of it for daytime wear and it plays beautifully with my makeup.

N I G H T
‚Ä¢ Pacifica Rose Kombucha Flower Powered Face Wash
I've tried nearly all of Pacifica's facial cleansers, and this one is my favorite. It is super effective at removing makeup and the general daily grime if I didn't wear makeup that day. And my skin feels SO soft after using it.  

‚Ä¢ FAB Skin Lab Resurfacing Liquid 10% AHA
I really love this so far (2ish weeks in?). It has not seemed to irritate my sensitive skin, even with nightly use, and even after using my Peter Thomas Roth Peptide 21 Amino Acid Peel (so gentle, but SO effective, especially for minimizing any cystic acne currently developing, and overall brighter skin). I also like the fact that it's in a dropper and can be applied with my fingers. Very faint scent similar to some Juice Beauty products, maybe due to the malic acid in both?

BeautyGuruChatter,fhg3ezr,t1_fhfg4tb,1581557685.0,"This info may be completely unhelpful to you, but I am a mentally/chronically ill person who could have written your comment nearly verbatim 4 months ago. 

In 2017-18ish I had very recently started some new medications for my Borderline Personality Disorder and GAD when I also started experiencing symptoms of fibromyalgia. In the process of getting diagnosed with that, I started other medications for treating pain and other associated fibro symptoms. Though my pain was being managed and my severe anxiety symptoms were almost non-existent, I also started feeling more and more apathetic, deeply depressed, severely exhausted, and completely unmotivated to ever leave my sofa. I also developed a very, very bad shopping addiction (which wasn't something you mentioned, but was def a factor in how fucked up my life felt at the time). My husband mentioned many times that he didn't feel like I was the same woman he married.

I assumed it was all typical fibromyalgia stuff and that the severity of my deteriorating mental health was due to dealing with my new reality. I pegged the shopping addiction as yet another unhealthy coping mechanism stemming from the compulsiveness/impulsiveness that can be a part of having BPD. The exact phrase ""this is who I am now I guess"" was definitely something I felt and said often over that period of time.

Due to some difficult financial circumstances nearing the end of last year, I just kind of...stopped taking some of my medications. For some, I couldn't afford to see the doctor for mandated refill appointments, and for others I was honestly too apathetic to bother refilling them after awhile. The last one that I stopped taking was Abilify, and the sudden withdrawal effects were immediate and incredibly difficult for about 3 weeks. But once I was on the other side of that I suddenly realized...I had exactly ZERO urge to compulsively shop. I stopped obsessing over promotional emails from various stores, curating online shopping carts full of shit I didn't need, etc etc. And then I found the FDA warning that a rare but possible side effect of Abilify use is SEVERE COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR (gambling, sex, drugs, and...you guessed it, shopping). Around that same time, I also made the decision to switch from Tramadol to Gabapentin for pain relief. Over the next few months, I started feeling like myself again. To be clear, my severely anxious self, but nonetheless myself! My husband, my family, my friends, literally everyone around me who has known me over this time period has confirmed that there has been a radical change for the better.

I'm still figuring out how to manage the anxiety and some other issues, but as a whole I feel much more whole and happy. If there is any possibility that there are other medication options that could treat your symptoms, it might very well be worth talking to your doctor(s) about them. 

Wishing you the very best and sending empathy and solidarity. Nothing about being chronically ill is easy or straightforward, but I hope that things will eventually improve for your mental health. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

The MAC Hyper Real Glow highlighter palette in Flash + Awe is my next favorite formula. I don't wear gold tones as often, but I have hit pan on all three shares in the palette. I am NC13 pale and on the pink side of neutral, and the rose gold tones complement my skin in a nice way that true gold highlighters typically don't. 

Stila's Little White Lies highlighter palette is so sparkly and reflective and lovely. Wear it alone and enjoy the sheer effect of pure glitter, or layer it over a more saturated highlight for a blinding, wet looking glow.

Becca's formula can't go without mention, because I do love it and recommend it to friends/clients all the time. It just doesn't fit my current ""disco ball"" aesthetic. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
BPD,fh9dpe9,t3_f1qk4r,1581378893.0,"It's gotten better with time and learning to be more mindful of my feelings, but yeah, sudden and intense rage over something super trivial is a BPD-specific superpower. 

The very biggest improvement I've been able to muster is to try to be very, very careful not to react directly out of my feelings. I take a breath, I leave the room, I journal about it, (if we're being REAL honest, sometimes I'll hash it out with my vibrator üòÅ) and if I'm REALLY heated I try to ask a friend for feedback or take a dose of my Xanax because at the end of the day, it's anxiety that is actually provoking my feelings of anger. And it's usually related to one of those core BPD insecurities like rejection, abandonment, etc. Once I can trace the anger back to one of those core insecurities, I have a better chance of evaluating how to reasonably respond to that anger. I've tried stifling my feelings or pretending not to be upset, but it never, ever works, in part because of my complete lack of poker face, and in part because even if I successfully stuff my feelings down for that interaction, they have this lovely tendency to come right back even worse than before when I see that person again. It's not wrong to FEEL angry, it's just wrong to react from it in hurtful and damaging ways.

BPD4BPD,ffnbpak,t3_eu73ue,1580064070.0,"Therapy would be my number one response. It helped me feel validated and learn some important coping mechanisms. 

The other things that helped the most when I couldn't afford therapy anymore are the advice blogs Ask a Manager (work stuff) and Captain Awkward (mostly personal stuff). Getting a better grip on personal and professional boundaries was life-changing and helped me feel more prepared for facing situations that stress me the fuck out and trigger me. 

I'll be 31 next month and it took a long time to feel like I was finally starting to get more control over how I process emotions and deal with stress. It's hard work, and requires pretty much constant self-evaluation, but over time, if you're putting in the work, things *will* get a bit easier.

BPD,ffk2j3w,t3_etvt2a,1580013816.0,"It's not stupid at all, it seems pretty mild as far as coping mechanisms go. 

When I read your post, it dawned on me that, in my case, the fear of being seen as ""too needy"" was rooted in the fact that, internally, I *was* really needy--in that I needed others to validate me to feel like I had worth and value as a person. I desperately wanted to be liked, by anyone and everyone, and so I would come on too strong, then overcorrect that by not responding for awhile, or apologizing for talking so much. 

I have been having some success lately with managing my BPD-specific anxieties (like the one you mention), and I attribute that to these things:
 
‚Ä¢ Better grasp of what healthy boundaries look like. The hardest part of BPD for me is just having no fucking clue what good boundaries are because they were definitely not modeled for me. But good boundaries are like the secret key to finding balance in all of your relationships. I'm gonna give all the credit for my development in that respect to Captain Awkward (for personal stuff) and Ask a Manager (for work stuff). If you enjoy reading stuff for personal growth, I can't recommend those two any more highly. 

‚Ä¢ Better language to communicate what I need when I'm in my feelings. See above recommendations. SO good.

‚Ä¢ Writing stuff down. I hesitate to use the word ""journaling"" but that's kind of what I'm doing. I've been using the app/website Evernote to keep logs of things, and some of those things are feelings and occurrences. I started doing it at the beginning of this month, and now I instinctively log things that upset or trigger me, as well as things I'm working on that make me happy. Some notes I will probably never open and reread, but writing them down makes them clearer in my head and helps me feel less fragmented. ""Those¬†who cannot¬†remember¬†the past are condemned to¬†repeat it."" (George Santayana) My memory is made entirely of FEELINGS so having a written record of things is handy in that sense as well.

All that to just say I feel you, and you sound like a thoughtful and considerate person."

makeupartists,fee5dqb,t1_fee39ge,1579026742.0,"Yes!! I love all of this advice.

Aside from my work in retail, I have been pursuing a career as a professional MUA, and spent most of 2019 building up my digital portfolio. I made it a priority to work with a diverse range of folks and I learned SO much in the process.

It was a bumpy start, and I had two different gigs (one paid and one unpaid) where the WOC I did makeup for were really unhappy with how their looks turned out. I actually was let go from the paid gig, and I decided the best thing for me to do was to ask for feedback from one of the models (C) from the unpaid gig since we were still friendly. She gave me the most honest and helpful advice and pointed out areas where I was lacking. I took her input to heart, did additional research on my own, and the next shoot I did with a WOC was absolutely fantastic. C and I have remained friends and are now planning a shoot for next month! 

And doing that work and building that diverse portfolio opened up a whole world of opportunities for me! Not only that, but I think it's a good way of practicing allyship with WOC who are often underserved, in my region at least. I was floored by the number of times women brought their own foundation to a shoot because the MUAs they had worked with previously just didn't have anything that matched them. 

So yeah, your clientele are an amazing resource! It is always beneficial to be able to put your ego aside and dig a little deeper in conversation to figure out what the issue might be for them. 

And you're right that ultimately, you can't please everyone! Sometimes even when you've done your best work, someone is going to be unhappy with it."

I am wondering, when you do a color match, are you verbally walking the client through your process? Are you coming across as a confident professional or do you seem a bit hesitant? Are you taking control of the situation, or letting the client lead you?

I ask because it doesn't sound like you're being very assertive or direct with these clients. You're the expert, you're objectively good at what you do, and that's part of the equation, but the other part is establishing trust and connection with the client. It might be worth asking a co-worker or manager that you trust to give you some general feedback on your process--for example, if you're going into a client interaction with a WOC already nervous that they will reject your recommendation just because you're white, that will inhibit your ability to connect with that client. You asked how to communicate that the client's choice is too gray/orange/cool/warm/etc--just be direct! Most people appreciate authenticity and sincerity. 

I hope that makes sense? I am a little sleep-deprived so let me know if I'm totally off base here.

I wish you the best of luck with this issue and hope you get some helpful feedback here in the comments."

And I find myself nodding along, but I know my physical presentation definitely shows that I'm disinterested or frustrated, and my thoughts start to veer toward escaping the interaction or changing the subject as soon as possible. But I feel this sometimes spending time with friends that don't have ADD/ADHD as well, so considering that anxiety could be the root cause might be helpful. But it also kinda feels like I just have a limited attention span, and any monologue that goes over that limit leaves me frustrated and bored."

If you *are* interested in potentially doing makeup professionally as a side gig, and that's why you are considering doing this wedding for the experience, this is how you could make it as cost-effective as possible (If not, skip this and scroll down to my last comment):

‚Ä¢ Ask the clients to bring their own foundation. It's normal for an mua who is just starting out to do things this way because lots of people who are self-taught and early in their career don't necessarily have the access to  industry discounts or funds to purchase a wide range of foundations.

‚Ä¢ Also have them bring their own brow products, eyeliner, mascara, and lipstick. Most working muas have their own, but also have the tools to sanitize these things properly and thereby prevent most bacterial issues. DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT use your own. 

‚Ä¢ Also have them provide their own blush and setting powder, especially if they have a wide range of skin tones to cover. Less a sanitary issue and more an issue of you not having anything in your personal collection that will fit everyone.

‚Ä¢ You can use your own eyeshadow if you like, but buy a small spray bottle and fill it with alcohol, and before you do the wedding, spritz the alcohol over the palette and wipe off the top layer of shadow with a tissue. Do the same thing after the wedding before you resume personal use. You can also request the bride bring whatever eyeshadows she wants to use if you feel more comfortable with that.

‚Ä¢ Use your own brushes, but buy something like IT Cosmetics Brush Bath or another brand's equivalent. Clean brushes before and between clients. 

‚Ä¢ Get disposable sponges for foundation application. Qtips for cleaning up little imperfections, and makeup wipes (I like the Neutrogena ones personally) because invariably you have someone show up with makeup on already.

‚Ä¢ Face and eyeshadow primer are pretty inexpensive to keep on hand, esp if you buy travel size to begin with. You can get Benefit Porefessional in a travel size for $15 and Anastasia Beverly Hills travel size eyeshadow primer for $13 I believe. Those are the ones that I personally use, but there are plenty of other options to consider. 

‚Ä¢ I would figure up how much those things will cost, and factor in travel, and communicate directly with the bride on paying for these things at a time PRIOR TO the day of the wedding. This should be non-negotiable. In the examples I've listed, the supplies should be about $45-50, and I'm assuming with gas the total brings you between $100-125 for the total price. That is a *STEAL*. For comparison, the licensed cosmetologist I contract with for weddings would charge $550 for makeup for a bride and 5 attendants, plus $80 if the bride wants a trial for herself. And we honestly aren't even that high for the local industry. 

***

If you *don't* want to pick up makeup as a side gig, then DO NOT DO THIS WEDDING. 

I did my first wedding as a gift to my new sister-in-law. It was makeup for 7 people total, including myself (I was a bridesmaid) and it was TOUGH and STRESSFUL. It took a lot of time and energy, and I offered my home for people to get ready and provided mimosas. It was worth it to me because:

1. I was building my portfolio and really wanted to do it
2. It was my gift to someone I really cared about and it made me happy to do it.

If you don't have either of those reasons to factor in, just don't do it. To miss a day of regular pay for people you barely know, for only enough money to cover your expenses...it's just not worth it. 

What they are asking from you is wildly unreasonable and pretty shitty, honestly. Don't let yourself be taken advantage of just to be a nice person."

Fibromyalgia,fcz50e7,t3_ejle5h,1578093791.0,"Oof. On the one hand, I'm glad gabapentin has helped you. It's been a godsend for me, too.

On the other hand, I can see why your other doctors are concerned. Fibromyalgia is a diagnosis of exclusion, so most of the time you're run through several different tests to rule out other conditions first. So they might feel like the other doctor didn't do their due diligence in checking for other possible diagnoses before naming fibromyalgia. 

I hope it's as simple as you getting a really perceptive doctor right out the gate and you just got to the ""finish line"" of being diagnosed quicker than most of us. It's not like it's fun or desirable to pay for test after negative test only to find out you have a disorder that ultimately only requires a simple physical exam and review of existing symptoms to officially diagnose. But I would definitely keep an eye out for symptoms that are atypical of fibro and update your doctors with any new or worsening symptoms just in case."
BPD,fcwrqf4,t3_ej4pp1,1578034964.0,"A lot of it takes time, practice, and feeling more secure in your relationship.

But a way to cope in the meantime is to accept that you can't necessarily control how you feel, but you do have options for how to respond to those feelings. You can journal about them, you can just sit with them for awhile and acknowledge them. You can leave the room for a minute and take deep breaths, or count to 15 before talking again after feeling triggered. You'll have to figure out what works best for you and unfortunately it's just something you have to grit your teeth through while you learn to cope more effectively. Always have a strategy for what to do if you get triggered, especially(!!!) if you're out in public together. Those have been the absolute toughest situations for me because having other people around for my freak out feeds into my feelings of paranoia and intensifies everything. 

The best thing I've ever done for my marriage has been to learn everything I can about maintaining healthy boundaries in my relationships and respecting the boundaries of others. It feels like teaching a fish to bicycle, because for most of us it involves relearning everything we've accepted as truth about the way relationships *should* work. But the more I learn about healthy, respectful communication and boundaries, the more equipped I feel to deal with difficult or triggering scenarios. The Captain Awkward advice blog is my recommended reading for anyone I know who is trying to break away from disordered habits and mindsets that don't serve them.

[This](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GYAUOBO/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_dlQaEbXQJG27D) is my favorite favorite wig I have ever bought. I got it in the shade ""Taro Purple"" and it's so dang pretty. It's thick and stays in place for most general life situations (though you can sew in clips very easily if you need to), and the color is so unique and pretty. They have SO MANY color options in this style! I will say that the one I purchased in ""Linen Blonde"" for a musical that I was in, and was disappointed that the hair on it was a little bit thinner. Still totally cute and nice, and I still use it sometimes, but something to consider. On the first wig, I did end up trimming the bangs because they were too long for my liking. I did a pretty shitty job and they honestly still look great. I get so so so many compliments on it and most people think it's my real hair!

[This](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XPCDQQK/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_luQaEb55KHM6K) is a wig I bought for a costume (Rose Quartz from Steven Universe) and it's so fun!! Definitely a bit on the dramatic side for every day use, but you can unclip the extensions from the top (the extensions are glued to these funky clamps that are super easy to place or remove). It's a little flat on top but you can fluff it up a bit or use dry shampoo at the roots. 

And [this]( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J39S4JM/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_qBQaEbDKP9YSV) one I bought to wear to Pride (bought the color the link takes you to) and have worn it several times since. It's very thick and incredibly pretty in person. I will say that I have had some issues with the hairline on this one falling back and looking pretty ""wiggy"" if I don't keep tugging it forward. I've tried to solve this problem with wig clips but I haven't found the right clip placement yet to keep it from slipping.

You just don't directly involve your friends in your marital arguments, *especially* mutual friends. 

I have a couple of close friends who I can trust to sometimes rant about something my husband has done that bothered me. I have borderline personality disorder and sometimes I need a friendly reality check on whether I'm normal angry or disordered angry. I'm not always the best at receiving feedback, but I trust these folks to tell me if I'm not acting out of my core values, and I take that input to heart and try to adjust my behavior or my approach if needed.

Those friends also know that they can tell me if they're emotionally tapped out or if my ranting is unwelcome or has gone on for too long. In my case, I *know* that I have boundary issues, so I try to be super vigilant about keeping the rants brief and to the point, and trying to figure out the issue on my own before checking in with those friends. 

And all that being said, I respect the hell out of my husband. When I talk to my friends about things, it's along the lines of ""ughhh frustrating behavior is frustrating"" and not ""omg my husband is a piece of shit I can't believe I married him and don't you agree that he's a useless waste of space??"" Which sounds like what you are hearing.

You need to set some hardcore boundaries with your friends, at the very least. Everything you've said here sounds incredibly stressful!

Everyone in a long-term relationship gets mad over petty shit from time to time. But talking to your friends about it to blow off steam should be both *infrequent* and *private*. Even if you're having major marital problems, it's not cool to involve your friends to the point that they feel overwhelmed and stressed out every time they talk to you. You didn't consent to being their on-call marriage counselor.

BPD,fbw4yd9,t3_eeqyeh,1577141084.0,"I recently read a post about Empaths that kind of stopped me in my tracks. It claimed that no, you are not an Empath. It said that being hyper-aware of other's emotions is a learned response to trauma. Basically if you're super tuned in to other people's feelings, it's likely because you learned to do so to keep yourself safe in situations with emotionally volatile people. 

I found [this](https://www.eggshelltherapy.com/empath/) article that explains it better than I'm likely doing (quote located under the The Developmental Perspective section): 

""Empathic intuition developed out of a precarious environment is often coupled with sensory high alert and anxiety. This state, known as hyper-vigilance, is a result of the neuro-pathways that have been formed in the brain. The traumatised empaths are wired to constantly scan the environment for anything or anyone that could be a potential threat.¬† Even realistically, as grown-ups they are no longer facing any danger, whenever there are changes in the atmosphere of a room or the emotional tone of other people, they still have an automatic and visceral fight-or-flight reactions, such as tightening of the chest, increased heartbeat, and a feeling that ‚Äòsomething ought to be done‚Äô. In the long run, such physiological stress could lead to symptoms such as adrenal fatigue, chronic fatigue, and depression.""

And personally, this feels A LOT like what I have formerly attributed to being an ""Empath."" The article I linked to also describes other potential situations where someone is just naturally predisposed to being emotionally sensitive, but IMO that ties neatly into the common idea that many people who develop BPD are both naturally more emotionally sensitive than their peers + developed disordered behaviours due to childhood trauma.

That of course doesn't negate that at times there are benefits to being more tuned in to other's emotions than our peers. It can lead us to be more conscientious and kind. But I think the ""emotional sponge"" effect we experience can really fuck us up long-term if it's not carefully managed."

I suppose for a GP directory they could list whether they have experience with treating chronic pain conditions, etc."
30PlusSkinCare,fbt53rr,t3_eeb5j8,1577068525.0,"One course when I was about 20 or 21 for moderate-severe cystic acne. Unfortunately, when I got engaged at 25 it came back. I have always struggled with IBS and in my 20s I started having more frequent and severe issues that led to a lot of testing, a few hospitalizations, and for awhile a suspicion that I might have small-bowel Crohn's, so for those reasons I never attempted Accutane again."
BPD,fbhui8s,t3_edaeea,1576882665.0,"So, from my adolescent years through my late twenties, my appearance was a source of major anxiety for me, and it took me ages to get ready to go anywhere because I was hyperfocused on looking just right. It caused me to be late to pretty much everything. If I felt anything was ""off"" about my looks (hair won't lay right, outfit made me look ""fat"", makeup not 100% perfect), I got super triggered and would get more and more anxious and irritable and inevitably explode. Somewhere between being diagnosed with fibromyalgia and just getting older/more mature/properly medicated, this has become FAR less problematic for me and I'm generally comfortable with my looks even when they aren't perfect. I still slip up sometimes if I'm already emotionally triggered in some way, though.

I also totally identify with the shame you're feeling after blowing up. When my BPD was at it's worst, and I felt triggered in some way, I would completely go off on my spouse, and afterwards I felt so ashamed and awful that all I could do was curl up in a ball in the bathroom and sob, or if we were out in public I would be so inconsolably upset that we would have to leave. I ruined so many outings and would feel like a complete monster and unworthy of love. 

I think a huge part of what makes our emotions as pwBPD so intense is our internalized shame over having emotions in the first place.

Medication has helped me a good bit, and therapy, but as I haven't been able to afford therapy in a long time, there are a couple of resources that have made an enormous difference in my thoughts and behavior. I've always enjoyed advice columns, and a few years back I stumbled onto these two: Ask a Manager, and Captain Awkward.

A couple of big BPD problems are just not having a clue about proper boundaries, and being unable to articulate our emotional needs in the moment. These advice columns center around developing appropriate boundaries and reasonable responses to stressful circumstances in both work and personal life. Both advice columnists give absolutely wonderful scripts to use to communicate with others, and advice on how to address the emotional side of things yourself instead of needing validation from others (aka self-soothing, one of the things we are pretty awful at!). I read every single letter and I can honestly say they have helped me slowly develop more appropriate ways of dealing with my BPD.

All that to say, beating yourself up for what happened is totally understandable, but not really useful. I think what might help you AND your boyfriend the most would be to focus on making a plan for how to handle it the next time you're in a situation like that. If you need extra time to get ready because you're really anxious, what is a way that you could verbally communicate that to your boyfriend in the moment? Is your boyfriend someone that you can trust to validate your feelings of anxiety and give you the time you need? Another way to work on this is to develop a ""quickie"" routine for when you're running late. Whittle it down to the most essential steps in your routine, and figure out what you can skip when you're running short on time. For me, my makeup routine was the biggest time suck. It was very elaborate and involved a lot of steps. I thought about which of those were the most important, and discovered that as long as I did my complexion, mascara, and lipstick, I could be reasonably happy skipping eyeshadow, eyeliner, brows, contour, etc. 

This won't keep you from freaking out every time, we aren't perfect and this disorder is very real and difficult to manage. But with a plan in place, you'll be more prepared and less likely to react in disordered ways, and your boyfriend will be more aware and better able to help you stick to the plan.

I hope this helps!! Hugs and validation from the other side of the internet."

SkincareAddiction,fbceo6b,t3_eckilr,1576722154.0,"UGH what a fucking asshole.

I was in the mall one night with my best friend (who is a gay man, I am a woman who at the time had cystic acne). We get flagged down by someone working in one of those random skincare kiosks, and I want to ignore them and keep going, but two of the guys working there were really cute so my friend engages with them and they start showing him their products. Eventually the first salesperson looks over and sees my bag from Sephora and looks at my face. 

He gestures at my shopping bag and asks ""Why are you just covering up your skin with makeup instead of treating it?""

FUCK that. 

For one thing, Sephora sells skincare too so he had no way of knowing that I didn't have skincare in my fucking bag.

For another, I have spent YEARS treating my damn acne, trying all kinds of different brands and medications, and had even gone through accutane, cleared up for a few years, and then had my cystic acne come back. And no way in hell was I going to put some random ass kiosk skincare brand on my sensitive ass skin.

And finally, as the vast majority of acne sufferers are well aware, most makeup did not impact my breakouts at all, and I broke out regardless of whether I wore makeup or not. In my years of experience with makeup and skincare, fucking moisturizers and other skin products have been far, far more likely to cause additional breakouts than any foundations I've tried. 

I know it was just an attempt at a sales pitch but hoo boy did he have my blood boiling.

How about we just fucking STOP making assumptions about people with acne, period? We wash our faces, A LOT, we try a lot of skincare, we medicate, we try our skin with and without makeup, we go through so much hell trying to figure out what causes our skin problems, and you, the random ass stranger trying to be ""helpful,"" can take a fucking seat and get educated."
BeautyGuruChatter,faux2c4,t1_fauv85e,1576353643.0,"Lol yeah you're right about that, I just saw red when I read your other points because they're literally not true, for all the reasons I already mentioned. Even though you say you aren't trying to excuse his behavior, the bulk of your comment gives the opposite impression and gives him a whole lot more credit than he is due. 

Now making YouTube videos and editing them for posting absolutely does take a shitton of time and effort. So if your comment was about him reusing footage from past videos? I could concede that. 

But creating a makeup look? Nah.

Edit: two words"
BeautyGuruChatter,fautym2,t1_fauqdaw,1576352670.0,"Uh, makeup artist here and no, a look like that would absolutely not take ""hours"" to create. 1 hour, max. Makeup looks are his bread and butter.

BPDSOFFA,famwz9u,t1_famiteg,1576215410.0,"""I didn't want her, didn't want to be with her, but I knew she'd never let up."" 

Uh, I dunno guy, seems like she let up pretty good when she went back to *her own goddamn country*. Whereupon you then followed her...and then stayed with her...because you didn't want to be with her. Right. 

""I seem to just wholesale forget everything that happened that was so bad, and *still think of contacting her*."" Nice, I'm sure she's dying to hear from the guy who absolutely positively never ever wanted to be with her and definitely isn't pining over her now. 

I'm not your diary. This is not a creative writing class. I gave you some direct feedback--that's it. I am NOT here for any more dramatic post-mortems on your relationship.

Ride off on your white horse and kindly fuck off."
SCAcirclejerk,famhjtj,t3_e9tzi4,1576204020.0,"I've been wandering SCA tirelessly for YEARS in search of the missing ingredient from my routine. After ages spent in bitter solitude to hide my hideous visage, destitute and debt-ridden from my fruitless skincare investments, I was ready to end it all. I was reaching for the St Ives Apricot Scrub when, suddenly, I heard the faint ping of a Reddit notification on my phone. ""What does it matter?"" I despaired. I started to reach for the scrub once more, but something told me to check Reddit one last time before meeting my harsh, scratchy fate. The app opened, and there it was. The skincare step no other shelfie had DARED to show. The step that would change my both my routine, and my destiny.

It was WATER. It had been there, all along. Waiting. Waiting for me to twist the faucet handle and release it from it's captivity. I cleansed my face as if for the first time, revelling in this new discovery. Once I finally patted my face dry with my trembling hands, I fell to my knees in gratitude and wept. Finally.



(Srs she just HAD to include fucking WATER as a step in her routine?)"
BPDSOFFA,fal73zv,t1_fal6sxy,1576179513.0,Huh. Thanks for the additional context. There's definitely some troubling content here.
BPDSOFFA,fak3hwb,t1_faim2ef,1576160194.0,"""It's so weird how she changed about five days before I left."" It's actually highly typical of someone with severe and untreated BPD. The type of black-and-white thinking that goes along with the disorder often results in exactly the kind of roller coaster experience that you have described here. She initially idealizes and puts you on a pedestal for a time, then seemingly out of nowhere (at least for you, for her there was likely a trigger, typically some kind of perceived rejection or abandonment) you're the worst person in the world. Weirdly, those extreme ups and downs can make you feel like you're really close within a short period of time--emotional trauma can feel strangely intimate. Eventually, just as suddenly and irrationally, she just disengages. Poof. You're likely correct that she has found someone new to focus her attention on. Despite what you went through together, unfortunately the depth of her emotional attachment to you was always going to be shallow. Her affection (without therapy and treatment) is like a security blanket--she can snuggle you in it, she can try to smother you with it, and she can fold it up and disappear with it. She simply doesn't have the emotional skills necessary to form secure and long-term attachments, and never will until she decides that the choices she's making are damaging and disordered and seeks help. The tragedy of BPD is that she may never get to that point, and will keep repeating the same behaviors and blaming external factors for the ultimate downfall of her relationships over and over and over again without seeing or accepting her role in it at all. 

Even acknowledging any missteps you made in your time together, there was absolutely nothing you could have done differently to change the inevitable outcome of her disengaging from you and moving on to the next person. 

Now should you feel sorry for her? I would compare her to a pitbull that has been neglected/abused by its owner. BPD doesn't come out of nowhere. Somewhere along the line she was conditioned to have this disordered approach to attachment. She developed this approach to protect herself. Unfortunately for you, the result is that she fucking BIT you. She inflicted emotional damage that you in no way deserved. So you can feel sorry for her, you can maintain empathy for her situation, without deciding that it's your responsibility to take her in and rehabilitate her. That's where I feel like you're struggling. I think you DO feel sorry for her, but can't reconcile that with your reasonable and correct decision to stop investing your time and emotion in her. And unfortunately--in this case-- for you, your attachment to her was probably pretty real, and as a result you can't just neatly fold it up and compartmentalize it. There's an inequity there that just feels wrong, and it feels wrong because even though she most likely didn't do all of this with malicious intent, for all intents and purposes, she abused you. She abused your goodwill, your generosity, and your emotions. 

When you said your personal life was in shambles, I wasn't surprised. It makes you vulnerable to people with intense attachment issues in a personal crisis. You think if you could help her somehow, maybe you get a win. By trying to manage her chaos, you shift the focus away from your own problems and don't have to deal with them immediately. It's a bandaid. 

Okay, I see I've written another novel here. Thanks for your response--I hope what I've said here maybe helps you make sense of everything. And I really hope things get better for you soon."
