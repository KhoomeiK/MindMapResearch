They didn't understand.

I'm currently fighting a darkness in my head that makes me view things as worse then they are. Names my life seem like shit. Or whispers to me to get angry and pissed at other people. 

It helps me to remember that there way I'm feeling is temporary. And that it WILL pass. As humans our moods fluctuate like a wavelength. Sometimes we're just not ready for how low our mood takes us and don't see that it gets better. It gets better. It does. Take a deep breath. Hold it for 3 seconds. And let it out. It does get better. 

What's really helping me is a book called ""How to stop feeling so damn depressed, The no BS guide for men"" by Jonas A Horwitz, PhD. I rented it from my local library.  Maybe this book is or isn't what you need. But find help. I went to a doctor and told him I was depressed and he prescribed Adderall. 0.o  I didn't take it very long. It didn't help my issues.  it wasn't until a year later I went to a therapist and they helped so much. Not all therapists are the same. Find one that works for you! Maybe A counsellor or friend to talk to. Pick up multiple books to find the one that will help *you*"

For me: Sometimes trimming it and keeping it short help stop me. 
Otherwise it really only gets better when I start to address the underlying reason why I'm pulling. 
As in, dealing with the stress, deep breathing, mediating, working on something, asking my GF to tell me to stop, journal my emotions etc. 

I hope this helps. It's not a quick journey to stop (I'm pulling my beard right now Dx) but it's worth it to center yourself (if you need it)."
