2. Make a plan but don't plan too much. Focus on your desired outcome. What do you want to accomplish in the end? Why you want to do it? 

3. Make it a habit. No one's a genius overnight. Do it everyday. If you fail, try for another day. Don't stop until you accomplish your goal. 

4. Track your progress. It makes you more grounded and focused on your goals.

5. Don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay to fail, it's part of the process. Just remember you're human too. Overexerting yourself is not good either.


Lastly, my favorite: just do it. Don't think of anything else, just do it. This made a lot of difference to me, especially that I tend to overthink.

I remind myself that planning is great but if there's no effort being exerted, it's pointless. 
I focus more on the execution rather than the plan itself. Having faith in myself and being in the moment also helped too."
