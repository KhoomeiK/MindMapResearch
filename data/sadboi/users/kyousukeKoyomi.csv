2. They are getting too greedy.

3. I can't even afford 12 dollars a month for internet. Currently I am using about 2-4 dollars a month. So it's going to be quite hard to get Netflix subscription.
4. I love offline content. U always loose internet connection. Even when I pay my network provider properly I never got reliable connection and even when I didn't properly pay I didn't get reliable network connection. That's why 90% of the content that I watch are offline.

3. Wanna be a English, since, math teacher 30-50 ( it's just an excuse for the teacher to charge more. They will teach 1 hour for 30 days and get paid a lot more ).
Hears some real jobs but part time ones.
1. Became a cardboard factory worker. 50 dollars a month.
2. Became a garment worker. 120-240 dollars ( but if you don't have 10th grade certificate then you will not get a job it's a new rule made by our shitty government. Now these fired worker's are taking life risking jobs like electricity works because they have a family to feed. )
3. Get very good education avarage monthly income may be about 500-800 dollars ( if you get the chance because these official government jobs are limited ).
Business.
1. Became a shop keeper. Monthly income. 50-200 a month if you have a small shop to a medium shop or 500-750 a month dollars if it's a big shop and 1000-2500 a month or even more but it must be a luxury for the rich elite. 
2. Cardboard box business. Heard it's about 400-5000 a month depending upon you production and if you are a huge business men the 5000+.
3. Garment business. 8000-20000 a month or even more ( but business option 2 and 3 are very risky )

I don't think you will notice all to Pixel on a small screen. For an example I have a 6 inch screen smartphone that has a 1080p screen or total of 2 million pixels. That's a lot of pixel for a 6 inch screen. That's about 4 times more pixel than I need! Why do I have so many pixel on a small screen. Because it makes it easy to read small text and details but because it's so small I can't get a proper 1080p experience but since I read a lot that's fine but I don't think you will buy a 24 inch monitor for reading Right. It's like a room full of 2 million people but it was made for 500000 people that's why you can't see all the people but only see 500000 people instead of 2 million people. Using the same law you should have a 40+ inch screen if you truly want to enjoy 4K.
So why so much size of the video file because if a 4K 2 hours movie is 4 gb sized then a 1080 2 hour movie with 8 gb size will look better. That's why you should test it your self. 
Get 2 version of a movie like Deadpool movie.The 1080p deadpool should be 4 GB size per hour or about 8 GB and the 4K should be 20-25 GB per hour size or about 40-50 GB and compare the quality your self. And Also remember that some people don't encode video properly witch means that they will give you the Deadpool Movie 120 GB 4K video but it looks worse than a 1080p 4 GB Deadpool Movie. So you should get the movie from a trusted and professional uploader.
I am sorry if it was hard to understand but it's your money and you should spend them wisely. But the test that I said you to do."

anime,fooi8pp,t1_fok2v3f,1587939475.0,I did though about Arararagi but we didn't have too much in common that's why I didn't include him.
LightNovels,fojh1mv,t1_fojgola,1587820682.0,That's even better!
anime,fojg5c2,t1_fojfyyv,1587819955.0,"Whole heartly agreed!
OHHHHHHH MYYYYYYYYY GODDDDDDDD
HOOOOOOOOLY SHEEEEEEEET"
anime,fojed7p,t1_foja318,1587818440.0,"That was a moment I didn't remembered.
But I soul did remember it. It was a powerful for me because it made he see another side of Goblin Slayer. I am not into yaoi but Goblin Slayer is my husbando!it made it clear that our beard cutter is willing to get help and stop being a loner for the sake of his love one's.
( I actually don't remember most details because I only watched it only one time on 2018 and I am trying to forget most details so that I can have a great rewatching experience )
Hears all the things that I love about Goblin Slayer.
1. It feels realistic. If you make any mistake then you will die and you will always won't win. 
2. It feels a little like Slice Of Life. An good example is when you watch his morning routines.
So the town peoples and others adventures journey witch makes it more realistic and Also tells minor characters story with make it more developed.
3. The Goblin Slayer himself. I live his personality. How mysterious he is and how we never see his full face. The development of relationship with other characters.
4. Characters. They all don't feel the same. They have different personalities.
5. It makes you accept harsh realities. One of the main reasons why I love adult anime is that it makes you accept your favorite characters fate. If someone you liked died you have to accept it. It's the same with these Anime.
( I don't know if this is some kind of mental problem but I feel sad for any animated, book character that I like and know died. It's like I lost someone close to me ) I even feel weak if you main character is feeling weak. Like So I am a spider so what vol 8. ( Spoiler )
The main character loses her powers and can't even walk properly. After reading that I also felt weak like the main character."
anime,fojda31,t1_fojafws,1587817441.0,"Another one of my favorite that didn't get a sequel.
Miss Caretaker Of Sunohara sou but it's just 2 years old so I am still hoping to get a sequel."
anime,fojcyz7,t1_fojafws,1587817154.0,"I only know about baka and didn't know about the other series.
Hears some anime from them that I am waiting for sequel also all of them are my favorites.
Watamote, Ore ga Ojou sama, A Sisters All You Need it's just too sad and very disappointing ðŸ˜”.
How can one studio make 3 of you favorite anime and never make a sequel. I did heard about the Or ga Ojou sama sequel but it got cancelled so that's a shame and I never know Non Non series was made from them. I didn't watched it yet I have hoping to get a another favorite if it becomes a favorite then it will be the first favorite anime from Silver Link for me that got a sequel."
LightNovels,fojckxf,t1_fojayff,1587816791.0,The second one sounds super interesting and rare!
anime,foj9oq5,t1_foj99c2,1587813863.0,I know about that. Just didn't watched it yet.
anime,foj9nsd,t3_g7rfpr,1587813835.0,"Top 5 saddest.
5. Akame Ga Kill. The entire anime everything from start to end. ( Just read the Mangas ending that will make you happy. A little happy I guess )
4. Dororo. ( Didn't watched the whole anime I think it happened after 6 episodes or more )
3. It was a hentai didn't remember it properly.
2. Happy Suger Life. This was my first depressing Anime and it changed me. I think it was good that I changed and I started reading and watching more and more Anime, Light Novels, Mangas, WN made for adults. My most favorite non Adults Light Novel is Tearmoon Empire.
1. School Life. ( Again I didn't finished it even after watching Happy Suger Life I can't digest this one. It just gets sad after that more sad and depressing and after that more sad and depressing and ole last time More Sad And Depressing.)
Honorable Mentions.
Goblin Slayer ( I do think it was worse than Akame Ga Kill but I already watched Happy Suger Life and Akame Ga Kill that's why I managed to digest it and after that Goblin Slayer because one of my most favorite Action Anime. )"

Like getting infected by covid 19 or getting my arm riped off getting beaten to death or commiting suicide but never thought that I randomly find someone who has the same personality I mean I never searched for someone like this.
