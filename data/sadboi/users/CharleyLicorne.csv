otherkringe,evrb3pd,t1_evqxzgh,1564704644.0,"Sweetheart, I'm not trying to say that they shouldn't get treatment. Hearing voices in their heads and having them take control of their body isn't normal, and is a mental illness... which is something that should be treated... 

I apologise for thinking that your life wasn't 'great', I just assumed that you wouldn't stoop so low as to make fun of the mentally ill unless there was something going on.

Most people with DID that are on social media and are speaking about it have been through treatment. Again, the treatment only enables co-consciousness, so the alters will not go away. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just makes life harder for these people. They are not saying ""it's great"" to have DID. They are merely trying to make the best of a bad situation, and usually educate people like you, who are too ignorant to think before they speak, especially about sensitive topics. 

If you would like to understand this mental illness and see how it affects people, I reccomend the YouTube channel 'DissociaDID'. Maybe then you'll see that you shouldn't shame people for having mental illnesses and trauma."
OtherkinInAction,evou6zo,t3_c29odk,1564658020.0,"Factkin are frowned upon by the otherkin community, and were invented by trolls. So basically factkin and fictionkin is bullshit"
otherkringe,evorypl,t1_evmk1ns,1564655634.0,"No, it's not 'sane'. DID is a mental health disorder. So no, they can't control it. Most do try and get treatment, but the treatment only encourages co-consciousness. This doesn't make the alters go away, and they never will, as they were formed at such a young age and because of such horrible experiences. 

I don't know what you've got going in your life to make you target a group of mentally ill people, but I hope that whatever is making you so agressive and argumentative is solved soon."
otherkringe,evl4q6t,t3_c8tdrx,1564590334.0,"Having alters/headmates is entirely different to being otherkin. People with DID have NO CONTROL over their alters. It's like turning into a different person. Otherkins do have control, and remain the same. This post doesn't belong on this sub."
