AmItheAsshole,f4pobal,t3_dlamrl,1571739064.0,"NTA! My husband is exactly like this. Not about Asian fetish but the general behavior is very childish when he doesn't get his way/gets caught/ reasoned with. A couple of days ago a fight ensued because I was tired and needed a nap, he than went on a rant how he works more etc. so basically I'm not allowed to be tired or have a nap (I took, I'm probably exaggerating the number, 50 naps in past 12 years so I don't have them unless I'm exhausted). I feel your pain!"

mentalillness,f1x2gom,t3_dawpow,1569792772.0,"If it makes you feel any less alone- I live in a very small community 1.5K people.  When I went through my first psychosis amongst other things I accused my husband of 12y of being a pedophile, called the police and told  them he molested our children. I also had a pretty public meltdown about that and the fact I got my period but was sure I was having a miscarriage. They took him to a holding cell? (Unsure if that is a correct term) and me to our small town hospital where most of the population in our town works, no one there could deal with me so they finally took me to a psychiatric unit in a bigger town where I was helped. During that time my 3 children had to talk to a doctor so they could determine if I was telling the truth or not considering my state.

I don't speak about that, I'm trying to forget it, but it's hard and still sorta fresh.
At that moment I believed in what I was saying and I couldn't help my actions or thoughts.
It cost me A LOT! 
But I'm still here and trying to get better, living in hope it will never happen to me again."

Yes I really hope as they get older I'll be able to tell them the whole truth and they will probably understand why it took me so long to get my ducks in row. Just recently they asked where is my mom and how come they never get to call her or why haven't they met her yet (they have a great relationship with my MIL, she visits us and calls them often so I assume that prompted the question) so I told them a few milder things about my childhood and explained I don't feel comfortable with my mom being in their life... they each gave me a hug and said they were sorry I had a bad mom and how come I turned out to be such a good mom if my mom was the way she was. that made me cry a bit!"

bipolar,eyl589d,t1_eyl3apl,1567176493.0,"I needed to hear this today! 

Was undiagnosed for a long time, had my first manic episode with psychotic symptoms a year and a half ago, got some meds but did  not want to be a pill popper like my mom and sleep 24/7, kinda thought ""oh man I've been managing pretty good for 30 years and the meds are making me different I don't know how to live with a different mindset/lack of emotions etc, I'm not suicidal or anything I just get very sad"" Downplaying it all basically. 
... got off the meds, did ok for a year but recently realized I'm NOT ok, mood swings are getting the best of me more often and more intense and would actually appreciate some help to deal with that if there are options why not explore and find something that helps. 

So umm I'm making appointments today and I'm finally feeling ready to accept the fact that I'm struggling with mental illness. There might be a way to live a life that is even slightly simpler? than what I've been dealing with on my own so far, it's about time to look into that!!"

I overthink for a little while and get incredibly upset over something that really bothers me in that moment, blow up, and than go back to being fine. I usually try to make sure I'm not overreacting by talking to close friends or just Reddit strangers before I blow up or at least I'm trying to train myself to do so... saves me from the guilt/shame..."
ECEProfessionals,eygmwhc,t1_eyexoup,1567072869.0,"I brought it up and we had a discussion she claimed she wanted everything to be on a certain schedule and children not to be rocked.  I mentioned I've been asking her how she wanted things done, trying to communicate but instead of telling me how to do it she went ahead and did it herself. Rules of how she wants it done change daily and she doesn't share the new ways as she changes her mind. 

Director came in in the middle of our conversation and she mentioned I should not be suggesting one thing that doesn't comply with licensing, I pointed out that she does things that don't so I need her to specify which rules we are following and which we don't as it seems to be a personal preference and I should be able to make suggestions she doesn't have to follow through with it and I won't be doing anything she forbids me to as she obviously knows better than me. Director sided with her at first but didn't seemed to wanted to be involved after I  explained myself to her, said I decided to bring it up with a coworker rather than her directly,  used I statements and we reached mutual agreement. I asked is that a proper way of handling situation and she said yes it is.

Co worker suggested late shift should be doing all the naps and I said I disagree, working 9-5.30 and sitting in the nap room 10-5 is too much for my liking and is not convenient for breaks/lunches. I suggested morning shift to do first two naps/still helping with meal serving/clean up and late to do the last one, she agreed seeing as it makes more sense overall and I asked her to communicate better in the future because I'm trying my best to follow her guidelines.

Troughout the whole conversation she seemed defensive, acting as if I'm not doing  what she wants me to therefore she had to take over and do it herself, at the end when I had an answer to why it's hard to follow when there is no communication, why I made a suggestion to do something even tho we are ""not allowed to"", and why certain shift makes more sense for a certain nap time she agreed said I'm right, we will do it that way and laughed it off. Let's see what happens now."
ECEProfessionals,eyd2f05,t3_cwjci2,1567010184.0,Thanks everyone! I feel like she's been more helpful today I'll offer to do after lunch naps and if she takes over again I'll ask if I'm doing  something different than her/she'd like me to do and if she says no I'll suggest a nap schedule for each shift so that way we both can have somewhat equal time in the nap room/awake room. Hopefully it all resolves as I otherwise like the said colleague and have no other issues!
