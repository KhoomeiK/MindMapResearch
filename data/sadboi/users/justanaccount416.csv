I don’t see where god has intervened in anything, supernaturally. I see it as a scam that he supposedly “saved the world” by doing something in the past whereas he could have done it at the end of time. Then everybody would truly be saved by a supernatural power. But no, you have to “find god here” and “find god there” and have personal experiences and you gotta “do research” in order to find the truth. If there was god, there would be no doing research to find he exists, there would be no books to learn about god. He would be there and everyone would KNOW. There would be no such thing as having “faith”. If heaven and hell were real, then a TRUE god would reveal himself to everybody, THEN the punishment and reward in the afterlife is just. But there is no evidence of a supernatural being and while you believe in god, it doesn’t suddenly make a difference as to what you do in life. Everything you do, you do it on your own until you die. God is in the back of your head while you literally live your life without him. 

This pandemic is a prime example of what I’m talking about. It’s all about the message of Christ until a virus comes and now we’re all on the same boat. Quarantined because no god is going to save us from a virus. Either he exists and doesn’t care or he doesn’t exist. 

If one has to find evidence of a supernatural being by looking at pieces of paper and having to “find” god, it says a lot about the supposed creator of everything.

If I’m falling off a 20 story building right now because I chose to jump off and you can possibly save me, will you ask if I want you to save me? 

If you say yes and don’t save me, then you believe I chose death. And if you created me and I chose to want death over life, is that not a defect in how you made me? 

Now if wont ask and you save me anyway, that means you *instinctively* wanted me to live. Thus, you *saved* me from death. That’s what it means to save. 

The Bible is very twisted. It’s trying to prevent the supposed original creator of humans and the world from being at fault by blaming the creation for being the cause of a supposed fall.

Let’s use my same example. 

If someone (God) tells me don’t jump off a building or you’ll die and someone else (Satan) tells me to jump off a building because you won’t die and I *choose* a side, what actually triggered and influenced me to choose an actual side???? I was MADE from one side (God, who is good) and not the other (Satan, who is bad). So if my GOOD CREATOR tells me don’t jump off a cliff because I’ll die, then by default I will choose not to jump off a cliff because I and my creator are GOOD.

We cannot prove whatever is in the Bible is true by using whatever is in the Bible. That’s circular reasoning.

But let’s *suppose* what you’re saying is true. You say God enforced those laws by punishing Jesus. One question is why didn’t he decide to enforce it after we die? That is, why didn’t he punish Jesus after everyone has died and is ready to receive the punishment, so that he can *truly* save them? Follow up question: Is God a person who *offers* or a  person who *saves*? 

A savior saves a person from danger and the person doesn’t have to choose. A person who offers is *about* to do or give something to a person, but the person chooses to accept or reject it. In our case, God saves us , then offers it. That’s a contradiction that doesn’t make sense. Essentially, God did an action of saving, but offered to us the action he already did. If we don’t accept the offer, he didn’t save us....even though he already did? Thus, God neither *saved* nor *offered*. It cancels each other out. If he saved, that’s a past action and we don’t have to currently do anything such as choose to accept or reject it. If he offered, it’s an action that didn’t happen YET and so we have to choose to accept or reject it in order for it to happen. And if he saved *and* offered, that means he did an action in the past not bound by any future’s choices and is about to do the same action in the future bound by our current choice.

There are many religious stories of how we existed. They’re all BIG claims since they’re all supernatural. And if I believe one, that means I go to someone else’s hell. 

I used to believe in Jesus my entire life until I went to the hospital and started thinking humans were demons and scriptures were being fulfilled and that the end times were here.

Christianity,fnkclhz,t1_fnkager,1587022104.0,"Please read. 

This is actually quite exciting for me because I’ve believed in Jesus my WHOLE life. My heart belonged to Jesus 😂 But here’s the thing. When you’ve been *believing* and not *knowing* something your entire life, you lack critical thinking skills to question what you *believe* is true or even EXISTS. There’s literally only 1 extraordinary thing that you believe in your life. And that is: how you and this world came to be. You don’t *know* how it came to be. You just *believe* 1 story out of hundreds of stories of how it came to be. 

I don’t refuse to see anything but a myth. I used to believe a myth and refused to see anything. One thing you’re refusing to see is that it CAN be wrong. And if you step into the mindset of someone who doesn’t claim it’s right OR wrong, from there you can decipher what makes it right and what makes it wrong.

As I was stepping outside of the box I’ve been in my entire life,I slowly started to become neutral. I didn’t take a side. I reviewed the sides. I used to argue AGAINST nonbelievers. I used to justify myself thinking I’m right. But what was wrong with me was I was presupposing things. Extraordinary things. Without proof or evidence. And that’s a leap of faith as the Bible says. But justifying religion is a contradiction. To justify means to prove something’s right. Religion can be right OR wrong. Proving something that’s not known to be right using itself is a MAJOR flaw. What do I mean? Saying things like sin, Jesus did this, Satan did that, heaven, hell, “fallen world”...that’s taking things out of a book that COULD BE WRONG. In no way does that make it right.

So when you ask me if I choose to sin and am a slave to sin, that’s a *religious* question, not a life question. Believe me I used to think I was living in sin every single day. Now I realize it’s just part of the fiction story. It’s like asking me do you commit fairy crimes against the fairy god. It’s silly right? Because you don’t believe in fairies BECAUSE you haven’t seen any proof they exist.

“Green Goblin disobeyed Spider-Man and tempted our mother”: Lucifer, the angel of light who was made good as I said, rebelled against God, got cast out of heaven; and then tempted Eve to eat the forbidden fruit. Lucifer somehow within him, being tempted by no outside evil, did an evil. 

“You have a curse to disobey Spider-Man. You don’t have to, but you will disobey Spider-Man at some point.  You don’t have to, but Spider-Man already says so.” It is claimed that God is omnipotent.

That there are hundreds of “stories” out there but all your life you will look and live life through one of them thinking it’s the truth?

It’s being conditioned to run and run around a track dozens and dozens of times and you’ve built up ALOT of endurance. I used to be like you and defend my faith to great lengths. So I’ve been there. 

How do I know that you’ve had cognitive dissonance? Because in our conversation, you’ve gone to great lengths to say what gods foreknowledge “actually” is, then tried to explain that free will is “actually” not what it may seem, then tried to say that I’m changing my topic from free will to god. It seems like I’m the one challenging *your* straw am I not? I’m the one playing devil’s advocate and you’re sticking to that one supposed truth you’ve been conditioned to believe is true, trying to bend and mend the truth to fit it to any discussion that challenges the one truth you’ve been told.

I’ve already messed up my argument because I supposed a god existed and I’ve tried to make both the validity of god and free will possible, thats why you said I’m changing my argument. Backfire. 1 + 1 cannot equal 2 without 1 actually being 1. That is, God + free will cannot equal god gave us free will, without god actually being god, and you’re right, that’s a different argument.

It seems like you’re trying to justify free will on its own then assuming god is god and that we cannot know his actual qualities. So you’re assuming 1 (god) =1 (god) no matter what then adding it to free will and making that = we have free will with god. That’s the definition of circular reasoning. You cannot assume god is real then argue we have free will with god. Unless you *dont* believe god is real and concluding we do have true free will? 

Either way, it doesn’t add up. Because you don’t know that the premises (god) are true (you SUPPOSE it’s true) then you argue the conclusion (we have free will with god) is true. I’m at fault for even supposing it’s true and you’re already at fault for defending it"

It’s like you’re saying “you can choose to go against the script I already wrote down”. NO SENSE. And if that were so, God would have crumbled up the script and thrown it away and we wouldn’t exist. So it’s because of HIS SCRIPT we’re still alive. 

The choosing to do right or wrong is an illusion if I’m inevitably going according to someone else’s script. I’m a mere dummy executing a program"

Imagine being taught that all your life and when you see something like “Spider-Man isn’t real” you try and justify it with faith and not evidence. That’s cognitive dissonance. I’m not with that.

I used to be Christian when I realized that I wasn’t taught to believe what I wanted to believe. I was presented a piece of information that can be true or false, but was told I MUST believe it’s true or suffer the consequences 

And there’s no problem with religion?"
Christianity,fnggcrc,t1_fngf6h2,1586931370.0,What does that mean
Christianity,fngfsp1,t1_fnge6ko,1586930876.0,"But you claim god has foreknowledge. That means he has a future already destined to happen. Which means our present moment, what we think is freedom of choice, is an illusion. It’s his script that’s playing out. If you decided to eat, is that not in his script that’s already playing out? Is it outside of his script for the world? No it’s not. You’re literally playing out his script which means he IS the cause of everything both good and evil because it’s in his script of foreknowledge. Which again begs the question. Why is his script of foreknowledge that way...

Now you might say “because of our free will and ability to make our own choices. Just because it’s in his script doesn’t mean he wrote the script”. That means we are writing god’s script...........that he already made? Does that makes sense to you?"
Christianity,fngf2y5,t1_fnge1yd,1586930262.0,Of course his foreknowledge would require your action. Of course a programmer’s code requires the robot to carry out the code the programmer made...
Christianity,fngev1r,t1_fngdmpd,1586930075.0,"But what makes him God? What he knows before or after? Am I god then if I know what I will do after I do it? And the main point is: what would make his FOREknowledge valid in any way? Only if he removes *actual* free will from the picture and makes robots that you think aren’t but they are. We are robots. Robots can’t change what they were programmed to do. If it is programmed to walk up the stairs, then the programmer sits back and expects the action to happen. The programmer, to you, is god. If god expected Adam and Eve not to sin (since he commanded them not to) then that means he sat back and watched the robot make its movements (which you think are choices) of not sinning. If the robot sinned, then there’s a defect in the code that the programmer made himself. If the robot didn’t sin, then the programmer made the code that way on purpose. It’s none of the robot’s doing"
Christianity,fngd1cw,t1_fngchxg,1586928558.0,"Why is that the case? Would god be all powerful and omniscient then? If he made you and knows what you will do in 5 minutes, whatever you do MUST align with his foreknowledge or else it would be false foreknowledge"
Christianity,fngcj2u,t1_fngc79w,1586928137.0,"Reading people’s minds means you know the outcome. And since choice inevitably *leads* to outcome, choice is forced to align with the outcome. 

So if I know the outcome of what you choose, what you choose MUST lead to the outcome I know. If I know the future I MUST control the present moment or else what I know is invalid. Is god’s mind reading invalid then?"
Christianity,fngc2hm,t1_fngbeit,1586927759.0,"You’re mixing choice and outcome of the choice.

Whether to eat the apple or not looks like a choice but it’s an illusion because someone’s foreknowledge passively forces the scene of choosing to happen. If God knows I’m going to slap you no matter what happens, even though I’m given a choice of slapping you or not at the present moment, I eventually will. If I chose not to slap you, then is god even god?"
Christianity,fngb89v,t1_fngaqzy,1586927072.0,Essentially you’re saying they chose their outcome. Another contradiction. Saying they produced their outcome means they have sovereignty over God because they could have changed what God already planned and foreknew.
