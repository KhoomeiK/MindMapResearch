Even so, I can't help myself thinking about how I'm going to mess up his life and set his house on fire when he does 'eventually hurt me'. It's become like a bad fantasy that I kind of enjoy... it's very frustrating for me but I can't get rid of the thoughts."

My dad took me and dropped me off and left long before me, he was almost home. Everything was great except it started overheating and shut down while going through a tollgate about 50km into my drive. Had to pull to the side of the road, phone almost flat, an hour away from being completely dark.. a guy pulled up behind me that saw the whole thing. I was very stressed, I wasn't in the best area. 

Turns out he was a cop from nearby. He helped me push the car out of the way and called people to come help me. He stayed with me for almost an hr making sure I was okay until help, and my dad, arrived. He didn't have to do that and it was greatly appreciated. My 19 year old self wouldn't have known what else to do in that moment.
