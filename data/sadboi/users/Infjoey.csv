Honestly I wish I had been smoking crack because the fact is doctors don't know why it happened and to me that is even scarier. I did everything right, and it still happened."

SuicideWatch,ffg2mo1,t1_fffq98q,1579897124.0,"I have two dogs. I love them dearly. When my one dog ran away and was missing for 24 hours I sobbed all night. Thankfully we found her the following day. They literally light up my life and keep my husband and I from wallowing in grief. I know my dog Paisley would be miserable if I killed myself.   

Holding your child for the first time after growing her in the womb for 7 months is an indescribable feeling. I never was a fan of other people's children either, just like I'm not a fan of most other people. But there is an evolutionary instinct to love your own child, and I felt it that night. You will never know what that love feels like and what it feels like to lose it in an instant, of which you should be thankful because it hurts like a fucking bitch.   

I am very sorry for your loss of your dog. I know it would be difficult to lose one of mine. What was her name? What was her breed?"
SuicideWatch,ffe57mx,t1_ffdpf7k,1579837011.0,"I saw it, and that does help a little. I just can't get over the selfish aching to hold her again and have not just any child, but her."

SuicideWatch,ffe4ztr,t1_ffdc06o,1579836849.0,"She was my longest pregnancy and only child. I'm terrified of having another baby. Amelia had a birth defect which caused her death. They didn't catch it until late in the pregnancy. I had so much hope she would make it, since other babies do. I feel like my body failed her. I had a miscarriage before her. Doctors and geneticists say it wasn't my fault and nothing I did, that it was random. But I can't help but feel totally worthless."
