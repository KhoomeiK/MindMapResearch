4. stirred the mixture on the stove continuously for around 15 minutes
5. Let it cool and added a normal tea bag in the hopes it would make it taste a little better (did not work)
6. drank it and waited about an hour and a half

Tasted absolutely horrible, but worth it because it worked and was pretty easy. I normally don't use stems, because there is barely any THC in them at all, but I've only got a gram left and need to make my weed last."
