Then after his wife's cancer diagnosis he went to a ""high dose"" of the Klonopin and after all the dust settled on his wife and she improved he tried to quit cold turkey; that destabilized him in a horrible way and when he tried to go back on it it didn't work. It's going to be a long road, benzos like antidepressants change your brain chemistry. I have gone through a milder story, still hell, but I'm still going. 

I have been worried about him since the first update, I was so happy to see this picture when she posted it yesterday.

There are no words that can give you an idea of the hell it can be, but spend a while reading through the [benzobuddies.org](https://benzobuddies.org) forum and search for c/t or cold turkey; that will scare you the correct amount as to how bad those drugs can ruin your brain."

The ego hangs on to whatever gives it the most meaning, if in the last few months something in your values has changed, where you left the person you were before, that's when before dying the ego will cling to whatever it can; and health anxiety is one thing it loves. If you can, therapy is the best option."
Anxietyhelp,fgg4ed8,t3_ey8s63,1580754008.0,"The key is to bring it down to a place where it's there but it doesn't overwhelm you. You are very young and your whole life is ahead of you, that said you are in a transition phase that is extremely overwhelming that passes around 25 where you have accepted reality by yourself and not dependent on your parents. One day you will understand what I'm saying but keep it in mind.

I would start with a free trial of Audible and hear the book ""Dare"" by Barry Mcdonaugh, if you can spring for ""Hope and Help for your Nerves"" by Claire Weeks it's also amazing. Just those two will make a major difference if you stick to them, even if you have to hear them a few dozen times. 

I would certainly tell your parents, and be prepared that they may not react the way you want, at first they may be in denial and will have to take a while to accept that you have anxiety,; I wouldn't be suppressed if they tell you they already know; one day when you are past 35 you will realize how they always wanted the best for you, and were right almost all the time. If they want to take you to therapy GO; learn to accept help and take it any way you can. Stay away from drugs if you can, but at all costs never take a Benzo like Xanax or Klonopin; NEVER.

Give that audiobook a try, it's the best place to start."

If you don’t have that then keep passing on people till you find that. There are some people like my wife that doesn’t worry about anything, that’s the kind of person you need.

lexapro,fcsn4vg,t3_eila85,1577920149.0,Both Psychs I’ve seen have said that for anxiety you have to be on the max dose of antidepressants. Going from half the max and below they only treat depression.

I am also taking it for health anxiety but my Psych said I have Panic Disorder that apparently covers all of them. I’ve had some rough days but will stick to it, I have another 6 weeks till my next appointment with him. I am on another few meds that I would hope to eventually kick and stay just on Lex."

The thing that works for me is staying bed for a good 4-6 hours just napping or staring at the ceiling, which is the opposite of what I want to do, that is obsess over symptoms and run for help. Other things that help are big high carb meals and watching romantic movies. For me once my subconscious calms down I start feeling normal again."

Withdrawals come and go, they don’t leave (I’m 19 months out) but do go down in strength.

Started feeling better even before the jump; the beginning of the taper and accepting what’s going on is the hard part.

Anxiety and all other symptoms come and go, recovery is not linear; after a few months you learn to appreciate and get air in the windows, and hold your breath under the waves until you make it to the other side."
