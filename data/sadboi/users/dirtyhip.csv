Last night I did my first past life regression meditation and I‚Äôm almost certain that I saw myself in a different life in a gas chamber. I am not Jewish, but I‚Äôve always had a fascination and deep connection to the holocaust. I saw myself as a completely different person in a body that was not my own, with stronger facial features, a shaved head, and emaciated body. I was curled up in a ball in the gas chamber and I was holding onto my newborn baby. From the emotions I was feeling I knew that I had lost my husband, other child, and all of my other family and me and my baby are the only ones left alive. All of my emotions felt so real but now I feel skeptical because I have never experienced anything like this."

I certainly have a lot of trouble opening myself up and being vulnerable around my family specifically, as I have struggled to fit in and abide by the rules and norms through my life. I feel a detachment and strong sense of resentment towards them, but I secretly wish we were extremely close and ‚Äúlovey dovey‚Äù for lack of a better word. You‚Äôre absolutely right, I am terrified of expanding my partnerships since I don‚Äôt want to get too close in fear of getting hurt. I assume at this point that I will die alone and always be unloved which are my greatest fears. What do you mean by my Scorpio stellium is very different from other Scorpio stelliums?

KUWTK,fp0usi4,t3_gafs1g,1588217398.0,"These two boys and psalm are close enough in age to be really tight knit while growing up. They will always emotionally support and look out for one another. This makes me really happy. 

On this sub, we have talked about how Rob was sort of neglected by Kris through his life and the rest of the female family have never been able to totally accommodate his emotional needs and fill the holes that they all left there. The Kardashians don‚Äôt know what to do with men. We have said it a million times. This is where my concern for young Mason comes in....

I‚Äôm thinking about his well-being as he grows up, and his place in the Kardashian Empire, since we have seen how it‚Äôs easy for them to OutKast people. Mason doesn‚Äôt have the luxury of having another male family member terribly close in age with him. 

Saint and Reign will be a duo, p and north are always gonna be super close, and dominate the scene first, together. Then the triplets and Dream are gonna be a little quad clique. Is that all of them? I lost count. Then there‚Äôs gonna be Mason, by himself, older then all of the others, and probably not receiving nearly as much clout or attention as the rest of the kids since he is the lone star. 

Imagine being Mason, growing up around the Kardashian women, SO MANY WOMEN. And constantly witnessing their exorbitant lifestyle, mannerisms, expectations, and habits? 

Then there are his male role models, which include his dad, and don‚Äôt get me wrong I love Scott, but he is not a good role model for a young boy to have; and he had Bruce, but lost that patriarchal figure before he was old enough to understand what was even going on. 

He seems to be really inspired by Uncle Kanye and loves his music. He would actually be a really great mentor for Mason creatively, but Kanye is mentally ill, and he is also a raging narcissist who oftentimes says some things that would have better gone left unsaid. 

It seems that Rob has put a significant distance between himself and the rest of the family, so maybe Mason will follow in his direction as he ages? 

I fear that Mason will become depressed in the future, and develop lord-disick-like coping mechanisms such as substance abuse, alcohol abuse, and excessive spending (but instead out of his trust fund). 

Ugh.... poor kiddo. 

I‚Äôm happy kourtney is his mom because she is the most emotionally in tune out of all of them. That gives me hope for the little dude!"

We lived on a super quiet, narrow, family friendly street, and I vividly remember a massive, creepy looking pickup truck turn onto the road and drive right towards us. Something in my head told me to run and hide, so the four of us all ran down my driveway and hid behind my moms minivan. Shortly after, the big roaring truck rolls up slowly in front of my house and comes to a stop. There were at least two men in the truck, and then suddenly one of them gets out of the passenger side. He was this bigggggg burly scary looking bearded dude and I can still remember that he was wearing a flannel and light washed jeans, and had to be in his mid to late 40s. They kept the truck running and he didn‚Äôt even close his door, and he looks around, then turns back to man driving, and says ‚Äúwhere did they go? I don‚Äôt see them.‚Äù I still remember the feeling of my heart dropping into my stomach in that moment. These men did not have good intentions. He couldn‚Äôt find us so he ultimately drove away, but this memory still haunts me. We have never talked about it since."
