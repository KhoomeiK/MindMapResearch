raisedbynarcissists,fpsdt94,t3_gemplk,1588871781.0,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. I really do think that there are some people who should never have been parents. Like mine. And it sounds like yours too. 

I know this is going to sound like small comfort, but you are ahead of the game with your self-awareness, introspection, and your solid knowledge that THEY ARE WRONG TO DO THIS TO YOU, and that it's NOT YOUR FAULT. (Caps to emphasize the validation!) You are quite young to have correctly arrived at these conclusions. (You're still in school, so I assume you're a teenager or early 20s). 

I am 48 and I am just figuring out in recent years that I was raised in an abusive home. They (mostly) didn't hit me, and I was provided with food, a nice home, good medical care and an excellent education, so what was there to complain about (people would tell me). I was not aware that ""emotional abuse"" was even a thing. Living the severity of the situation made me want to get far away from there as soon as I graduated high school, but I couldn't accurately say why.

I wish I had been consciously aware like you. Because I wasn't, I didn't realize that the partner I chose and married was emotionally abusive too. It was a different flavor of abuse (but no less severe) so I didn't recognize that the things he did were breaking my psyche down and making me miserable. I've been struggling with anxiety for several years; now I finally understand why. 

So good for you for seeing and understanding how things are! That's the basis from which you can make good choices for your life, and surround yourself only with people who build you up and support you. 

And in the meantime, good for you for reaching out for help. You don't have to go through this alone. I'm sending internet (((Hugs))) to you."
AmItheButtface,fls60zj,t3_fqu2s1,1585435106.0,"Clarification: I live in the US where many hospitals have already run out of PPE supplies.

Mea culpa: I know I should have thanked her for thinking of me when she shared the link of where to order them. And I could have expressed myself in a way that took her fears into account. I was just so focused on the fact that I thought what she was doing was so morally wrong. I know that as a physical therapist, you can’t always keep 6 feet away from your patients, so yes there is a bit greater risk for her than for me. But when I went to my physical therapy appointment a week ago, none of the therapists were wearing masks, they were just taking the sensible precautions (disinfection/sanatization, distancing as much as possible) and they seemed to be ok about it (I accidentally overheard part of their staff meeting).

Context: neither my sister nor my stepmother have any risk factors that would predispose toward a grave outcome. I don’t either; however I am disabled, and if I were to get sick and need a ventilator, under rationing circumstances (rationing is inevitable in this pandemic) the disability would probably count against me. Also if I were to get even moderately sick, I would not be able to care for myself, which I am barely able to do on my best days because of my disability, and I don’t have any family who is willing to help me. So it’s not like I have nothing to worry about. But I still think it wouldn’t be right for me to use 95 masks."

He committed emotional violence, in countless ways, instead of screaming at me. And physically, he didn’t punch me, but instead he physically restrained me and held me against my will, to control me and make me do what he wanted when his words didn’t work. Screaming would have been obvious, as would have been punching me; instead what he did was so insidious. He raged at me by doing things that would hurt my feelings; a ton of things come to mind related to his interactions with his “friend” who was also somehow “family” to him, who it turns out was his girlfriend before me. In hindsight I think that some of the stuff with her he made up, because he knew it was the thing he could say that would hurt me the most.

They say it avoids the problem of “adjacent segment disorder”, the phenomenon where the disc next to a fused disc subsequently develops problems, like you mentioned. My cervical ADR is a success, so far, and much much easier to recover from than fusion surgery (I had that too at other levels before the ADR).

I only half-way gave in to the hoovering. That is, I agreed to see him, spend some time with him, have sex with him, but I refused to be his girlfriend. I thought, no harm in having a good time until something better comes along. I told myself I wouldn’t trust him, I wouldn’t believe anything he said. And as soon as he acted in ways I didn’t like, I was gone. He didn’t have the opportunity to discard me again. But I found that I couldn’t un-feel what I felt.

Even though I’m in my 40s I had very little dating experience because I had been married most of my adult life, but even so, since I made that comment I must have been aware that getting to “I love you”s and suggestions of living together so fast just isn’t *normal*. (Incredible how much more I value normal now.) In my head at the time when he’d say those kinds of things, I thought, I’m just going to play along because this just feels so good. I still wonder what would have happened if I had actually spoken my mind? Hey, not so fast buddy, we’re having a great time, but there’s no way either one of us knows the other well enough to love yet....? Maybe he would have moved on to easier pickings? I’m not beating myself up over it, because there’s no crime in keeping some of my thoughts to myself - in fact I think an outside observer would have thought that under the circumstances it made me the more normal one.

I haven't been able to work in 15 years, and am not expected to any time soon. (I had head trauma and a collection of spine problems/8 major surgeries so far.) I find that everybody asks about careers or what you do for a living pretty early on in the dating process. It's a question I usually have to field at the first date, if not by phone/text before meeting in person. ""I'm not working right now due to medical issues"" always elicits follow-on questions. Ditto giving a vague answer that is truthful about what I used to do, but leaves out the chronology of it.

To clarify, I'm not embarrassed about it. I have come to realize I am not broken (that took time!). Tbh, I think I'm a catch - I'm smart, caring, fun, and pretty. I'm just concerned about not having the opportunity the to be judged as a whole person, as opposed to a collection of medical problems.

Will it set me back horribly, like the unwanted contact I had from him before? (Blocking him isn't the answer, he has circumvented it before; yet I refuse to be bullied into changing my phone number/email.) I will never have an interaction with him to provide closure like the other poster was able to have (she's lucky about that much), so I am concerned that it will leave me perpetually vulnerable to his mind games.

Are you prepared for how you're going to handle it if he does pop up again? The fact that he's stalking you on social media still, after all this time - I'd say that's a good sign that she is right.

I've come a long way, I have times when I feel soooo much more calm. I wouldn't say I'm happy. I'm quite lonely.

You are acting like a text buddy, so it's giving him the wrong impression that it is working for you..

When he texts you, suggest what you would like to do the next time you get together. If he likes the idea, suggest a place/time, and ask if that doesn't work for him, what time would. If he's too vague and doesn't nail down specific plans, then just tell him what you really think. Tell him that you don't know why he seems to be reluctant to meet up with you. And that if he changes his mind, that he should let you know, because you are interested. It gives him the benefit of the doubt - he may have something going on in his life that makes it hard to get together right now but he is interested too, so try to not be judgemental. 

This has the benefit of being true to yourself and quickly determining whether he is up to fulfilling your needs. The ball will be firmly in his court, so you won't have any second thoughts about it.

When you're ready to dip your toes in, don't worry, whatever it is you have in mind, it's available. With any OLD and probably tinder in particular, you have to wade through unbelievable numbers of unsuitable profiles. Just be prepared to swipe left *a lot*, to have the majority of matches not go anywhere at all, and to go on a lot of first dates that don't fit what you want. It's definitely not an efficient processi! But the really good news is, whatever it is you are after, you can find it. My tinder experience has probably been better than average.

I used to think this too. I don't anymore. I think now that it shows how little importance they put on their SO's feelings. If infidelity is intolerable to you (meaning you can't put up with it happening again), you must convey this with *action* (leaving) not *words*.

I'm so sorry your going through this. You'll survive, and then you'll be OK. It will take a while, but you will be OK.

BPDlovedones,f6x2ltk,t1_f6w3c69,1573240514.0,"I thought I laid down the law about it, I broke up with him because of it. I later put it in writing, when he wanted me back, that I wouldn't take him seriously about promises that he would stop until she was gone and he had no contact with her for a month already. I insisted he stop first, before I'd consider any commitment to him. Because that's what he really wanted from me more than anything else, to commit to a serious relationship with him, telling people we were a couple again, make plans to move in together, etc. I said he broke his word before, so I needed to see the change in action first. He just had me so turned around, he said it wasn't fair for me to ask him to do this, esp. to blow up the relationship he had with her daughter (I do believe the daughter was special to him in a non-creepy way), because he did not have confidence that I was willing to commit to him after he did that. And I did see his point about that, because I was honest with him about the other reservations I had about him, about other things I did not mention in the post....there were many! He said he wanted to talk to me in person about it, and I thought that was reasonable too, because before that it was all by email. And I thought, why not; even if I agreed to see him in person (or sleep with him, for that matter) I was still not going to budge one inch on giving him any kind of commitment, which I know for certain is what he wanted.

It's like my confidence in my position was eaten away at the edges. He is so persuasive, he didn't yell about it, he just just talked. (Until the last incident, but that's a whole different thing.) It's just like he quietly was trying to re-define what ""normal"" was, and while I knew deep inside what was and was not right, I lost confidence in my position over time. I'm glad I never budged on what he wanted most from me though. Thank god for that. Now I just have to re-learn how to trust my gut. 

This is why NC is the secret sauce!!! 

Good for you for ending it like you did. If she was willing to cheat on him to be with you, she would be capable of cheating on you to be with the next guy. It sounds to me like you dodged a bullet. 

Thank you for sharing your experience. It's really helping me understand things."

Things will get better. Progress isn’t linear."
BPDlovedones,f6vj69v,t1_f6uutai,1573187800.0,"I’ve been through the court process myself. Feel free to pm me if you want info about it. It was a whole education in itself.

Take pictures of everything, before you tell him or file with the court for either eviction or TRO (temporary restraining order). That way, when he damages things, you have proof that it got damaged after he found out about the eviction or the TRO. In some jurisdictions, the property damage can get rid of the 30 day requirement for evictions. That’s a right that landlords have, to not have their property destroyed.

For the TRO, I’m sorry to tell you this, but there’s a good chance that he will file one against you in retaliation. And it will probably be granted, on a temporary basis, until there can be a hearing, even if his application is a pack of lies. ***This is not a reason not to file one yourself.*** You need one to ensure your safety. I’m just telling you this so that you’re prepared. And make sure you have all your ducks in a row before he knows anything. Do not tell him you are going to file for one. You need to be the first one to file for a TRO. Otherwise, if he files first, even if he lies in his application, you might be the one who has to move out until the court sorts things out.

After your TRO against him is granted, you will also need to have a hearing before you can get a permanent DVRO (domestic violence restraining order). But the courts move so slowly, you’ll almost certainly have him out of your house by then. So then you’ll have to decide whether it’s worth it to you to continue with getting a permanent DVRO, depending on how much of a threat he is to you after he is out of your house.

If you can, get a lawyer. There might be resources available, see if there are domestic abuse advocates through your courthouse. Even if he has never hit you, it’s still domestic abuse, because of the threats and the property damage. He’s doing things to scare you, so he can control you. That’s abuse. There are lawyers who do a lot of these cases, so they will probably recognize it better than you. 

You are right to feel anxious right now, because you are under threat. It’s ok to feel that way in response to his actions and this whole situation. I just encourage you to make use of all available resources to keep yourself safe.

I know you feel you can’t leave because of your animals. Instead, can you have a friend or family member stay with you? You will be safer if you are not alone with him."

Mine wasn’t self-aware and was allergic to apologizing. But he really did bust his ass trying to make me happy. He truly did everything he could think of. E.g., once I was at his place and in the middle of the night I asked if he had some Advil, which he didn’t, and he just about jumped out of bed to go to the store to get me some. I tried to tell him I would wait until morning. He made me tea every morning and brought it to me in bed. He gave me the most thoughtful gifts for no reason. He really wanted to take care of me.

BPDlovedones,f6vdhji,t3_dt8pli,1573183155.0,"I’m so sorry you’re in this position. 

Can you try to shift your focus away from him and onto you? I’m not minimizing how bad his actions make you feel - actually the opposite. You don’t want to feel the way he makes you feel because of his behavior, so you need to make things about you, not about him anymore. Because that’s the only way you will get to feel differently. I’m making some assumptions here, but he’s probably not going to change in a way that’s going to get you what you need. It’s about what *you* need. Not what he’s feeling or doing or maybe might do. You can’t be responsible for his mental illness. Can you talk to a divorce lawyer? And a therapist, for yourself? 

No one else is going to be responsible for your happiness, so it’s going to have to be you. If the situation isn’t sustainable for your own contentment, then it’s up to you to make changes. The good news is, you can do that! You’re not the one with the mental illness, so you have a real shot at happiness, if you can dig deep and find the strength to get what you need. And when you feel like you can’t do it, you can reach out, just like you are doing now, and we can support you along the way! 

It probably doesn’t feel like it now, but there are better times ahead - of that you can be sure. And for now, one foot in front of the other."

Let me repeat: where she is now is NOT YOUR FAULT. 

You can't save her. In fact the opposite: being in a romantic relationship makes improvement of BPD symptoms even less likely, even for patients who are self-aware and committed to therapy. So in that sense, staying away from here may be the best thing you can do for her - not that you should choose this course of action for that reason. 

You should choose it for your own emotional health.

Please listen to the others who have recommended therapy for yourself. 

And mikedagd is wise, listen to him: NC is THE WAY. The only way. (I tried everything else.) The longer you are in contact, the deeper the hole you are digging yourself into.

It is so hard to see someone we love suffer, I can't even imagine how hard this is for you. But there truly is nothing you can do that could possibly help her. So try your best to shift your focus back onto yourself and your future without her. Things will get better for you.
