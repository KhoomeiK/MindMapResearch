mentalhealth,fr2du1u,t3_gm9rxy,1589835575.0,"I just recently told someone to about that I need professional help too. I didn't say anything about my selfharm and suicidal thoughts and other mental issues but at least now I'm getting a therapist.

I just wanted to say good luck to you and that I'm going through a similar situation and that I also believe both of us can get better."
mentalhealth,fr2da11,t3_gm8gq2,1589835303.0,"I really think that you should try to get some help. Talk to someone you trust or a therapist, it was the complete opposite of what I wanted to do when I felt like you do but keeping everything to myself led to selfharm.

It took me years to get the courage to tell anyone but ever since I did I can tell I'm getting better.

Good luck"
mentalhealth,fr2c0o7,t3_gm9bkf,1589834693.0,"Hi, I had a time in my life when I felt like you do. Do having energy and not wanting to do anything.
I didn't feel exactly like you do, but similar.

I'm going to get a therapist very soon but for other reasons. I really think you should try to get some sort of appointment with a therapist or maybe your family doctor if you can.

It's easier for someone who knows a lot about mental health to understand how you're feeling and to help you.

Best of luck"

I don't know if I should tell my parents about my selfharm and anxiety when I tell them about that I think I have ADHD. Cause I don't know if they have anything to do with each other. The only times I've told them about my anxiety have been after fights, when I can't control what I'm saying.

AskReddit,fnxqjqn,t1_fnxps8b,1587344239.0,"I'm scared to show them. I've tried to talk to them and their reaction is like they can't believe it's true. Probably because no one I'm my family has had any struggles with diagnoses, suicide, selfharm and depression. Only one of all of my relatives have diagnoses that I know of.

I'm also scared for rejection, my parents are supposed to be the ones to trust with anything and if they tell me it's nothing and it's normal then I'll keep living like this, because I trust them. And I know if I keep living like this I might end up commiting suicide when I'm at my lowest low.

Whenever I'm feeling guilty I always add up every time I've hurt someone to make myself realize how horrible I am and that it'd better if I just didn't live."

First of all, I'm under 18 and live with my parents which is why I need to tell them.

 I have always felt really different from my family. Anger issues, anxiety, depression, you name it.
 And at first I thought it was just my personality but a few years back I started doing research to see if there was anything that could help me. I thought ADHD was just being extremely energetic but the more I read about it and the more doctors I ask on forums about it I feel like it's really similar to how I feel and act.

 I can't really control myself which results in me hurting others and myself. It's been going on for as long as I can remember and it's killing me not knowing what's wrong with me.

I'm pretty fucked up too.
