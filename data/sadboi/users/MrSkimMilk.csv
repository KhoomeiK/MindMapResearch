The fact is that parents aren‚Äôt infallible and are often dealing with their own trauma and failings as a parent. They think it‚Äôs a phase. Or not that bad. Or not systemic of a greater problem (depression, anxiety, etc) They cannot admit to themselves that they failed. 


Teachers, pastors or whomever are too tied up with the institution they are involved in to really care about the individual. There‚Äôs papers to grade, lessons to give, a lot of outside impressions. They are told how to  view the world and our problems.


Sad to say that many adults we encounter as teenagers are too aloof or distant or distracted by their own bullshit to really care. Some do, but most do not.


True healing comes from within. Confide in friends or therapists who care and are focused on YOU! Not weighed down by the bullshit of everyday life."

You may shit all over this but it‚Äôs what helped me the most...have you tried working out? Even if you‚Äôre fit, working out releases chemicals in your brain that can stay with you.  It also helps you with your sleep cycle. I found myself being less restless at night. My university had a gym open late, so I would go to be alone and decompress from everything. It also affected me mentally too. I was able to set and meet realistic goals, which I found to be very rewarding. Small increases in weight, time or distance for example. The routine, chemical, and mental benefits helped me clear a lot of static in my head.



And, of course, therapy. A lot of places have free/low/sliding payments. Larger cities have free anonymous walk in clinics, too.


Hope you find your path."
