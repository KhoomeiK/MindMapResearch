I agree with this, and would add that the dominant person is also being told they are wanted, because they are being given free and open access to the submissive. They're being specifically told that their phallic presence (meaning penetrative, aggressive, assertive, initiative) represented by their fingers in the other person's body is not only always welcome, but it fills a void that makes the dominant infinitely valuable to the submissive. That's the basis of the submissive's desire to serve and worship. To secure that value.

gentlefemdom,fpwbaik,t3_gcc8v8,1588960438.0,"People are saying he is being punished, I do not see it this way. Please look at this eyes and face.

Panel 1. He is cocky. He knows he's pretty and he wants to dangle his cute behavior and appearance to get attention. He wants the attention because he feels lonely without it. His confidence is actually exposing vulnerability. He feels alone. This isn't his true personality, but it's the lure he uses to get what he needs from others. The first panel is bratty, but not truly authentic.

Panel 2. Notice the way his eyes change. Not just because he is gagging, but there is sincerity in his eyes now. There's a sweetness to the way he is looking and the way he is surrendering so readily. His cheeks are blushing and his lips are gentle. He's not resisting. He's being degraded and loved simultaneously. That need for attention comes from a place deep down where he understand that he believes he is worthless. He's begging for validation, not to be a brat, but because that's the only way he knows how to ask for what he needs. He hasn't been taught love as a passive consequence, he believes he has to ask for it, which is the opposite of what he wants to do. He prefers to know it's there, chasing him at all times, by default. The dominant person is not punishing him, they are loving him. They're giving him exactly what he is asking for, not overpowering him. There is no resistance on either side of this exchange. The reason the dominant person does not feel threatened is because they know his true self. By giving him what he is asking for, they are actually unlocking the part of him who wants to serve and give. The part of him that is helpless, submissive, and appreciative. He feels safe with her fingers in his mouth, and as a result, he is prepared to give himself to her in order to maintain that emotional safety in her possession. She doesn't need to punish him, she is effectively activating the part of him that worships her. It doesn't need to be a display of power, or a petty act of discipline. It's an understanding. It's a favor. She's granting him access to the part of himself he loves, despite thinking its worthless, and she is showing him that someone else notices it too. This is the farthest thing from punishment in my mind. It's grace.

Panel 3. He doesn't feel ashamed, assaulted, offended, or bratty. The string of saliva from her finger to his lips represents her acceptance of his internal state, not just his external beauty. She isn't afraid of him, or disgusted by him. She accepts him. She isn't looking at his pretty face, she is looking through him. To the core of why he submits. She isn't giving up power by giving him what he wants, she is gaining power. Like a drug dealer over an addict. The more he gets her approval and dominance, the more he needs it to feel safe and real. Look at the change in his face. There is surrender. His mouth lingers open, symbolizing his willingness to be invaded by her as many times as she pleases, because he wants to be filled by her presence. His tone changes from ""Sure, okay-"" to ""Thank you, Mistress."" He didn't want to resist in the first place. Being bratty was just his way of telling her that he felt alone, and she is the only one who can fill that void.

Existentialism,fptnkky,t1_fptmn6j,1588894624.0,"I disagree with your opinion here. You're framing this in a way that implies a person is free to choose their lens of perspective. You literally say

> It’s pretty much optimistic or pessimistic and the choice is ours.

This simply isn't true. You can try to learn about ways to view life optimistically, but to say it is a choice how you view things demonstrates a lack of understanding how the mind actually works. 

When it comes to something like the lack of meaning in the universe and the seemingly unnecessary suffering of our existence, optimism here would be assuming that there is or can be a better result than the one you've rationally concluded. You used ""distraction"" as an example.

> Distraction can be another word for occupied/busy which can have a positive denotation.

Again, I disagree. I understand what you're trying to say, and at a certain depth you're right, but there is a deeper layer where you are wrong and that is the layer I find most relevant here. If I set out to understand the universe and I genuinely conclude it has no meaning based on my absolute best rational effort, the rest is my reaction to that conclusion. I do not control my reaction to information. No more than you can ""decide"" to be happy when someone you love is hurt, or dies. Who we are at our core reacts to things based on the accumulation of our nature and nurture.

I can always make the effort to try to change by exposing myself to new ideas, new practices, etc. Maybe one of them will stick, but that is not something I control. No amount of discipline or will power can change someone from who they are, or how they perceive and react to their own personal truth.

What you are saying may sound uplifting and flexible, but it's actually very degrading and unhealthy. You're telling people they are choosing to suffer, when they aren't. You're telling people they're choosing to see a lack of meaning, when they aren't. These qualities - suffering and a lack of meaning - are inherent qualities of existence. They pre-date our own thought process and they are out of our control. No action we can take will change them, so blaming the individual for reacting in the way they do as if it were purely subjective and open to whimsy is just false and dangerous. It's one of the reasons people with mental illness can't get help and are alienated from their communities, because people view things like depression as just a ""choice"" not to be happy and see the bright side of life."

I have stood there staring at myself in the mirror and felt like I will never be beautiful because my rib cage isn't small enough or my waist and hips don't curve in a sexy enough way.

I am at heart a philosopher more than anything else, so my approach to trying to express my feminine side is rooted in something much deeper than just the standard societal expectations for beauty. I've been learning a lot about what it means to feel beautiful and what I'm attracted to. I'm happy to share anything with anyone who will genuinely benefit from the struggles I've faced with my own self-esteem."
feminineboys,fpsr3om,t3_gf414v,1588878187.0,"Unless you are transgender MtF, the goal is not to become a woman. Your goal should be to understand what makes you look the most attractive and go in that direction. Changing yourself completely down to your bone structure isn't making yourself beautiful, it's being someone else. 

Hidden secretly within your question is the question ""Can men be beautiful, or can only women be beautiful?"" Answer that question in a way that allows you to find your own beauty instead of trying to look like someone else. If you have wider shoulders, find the clothes, weight, posture, hair style, etc that makes your wider shoulders look beautiful.

Femininity is NOT the same as being female. A lot of what femininity represents is the ""beauty"" side of the ""beauty and strength/utility"" coin. Strength and utility are seen as masculine because there is an ""expendable"" and ""rough"" element to them. War and work, which are traditionally masculine concepts in culture, are seen as value created from sacrifice. A scar across your face is masculine because it isn't designed to be beautiful, it's a result of taking risks with your body in order to win and achieve and conquer. That doesn't mean a scar can't be beautiful, and here is the main point I want you to understand.

When you make a switch from masculine to feminine purpose, what you're doing isn't trying to become a female, or remove your scars. What you're doing is shifting the purpose of them and yourself away from ""My job is to be practical"" toward ""My job is to be beautiful."" So you're trying to make what you have the most beautiful version of itself, not change yourself into some sort of archetypal female. Does that make sense? If you have a scar, re-purpose the scar toward beauty instead of leaving it as a result of practicality. The scar itself isn't beautiful or ugly, it's how you are framing it that matters.

To prove my point, consider ""plus sized models"" who are female. They are obviously much larger than the typical female model, but they are still beautiful. While fat and muscle are usually more practical than beautiful, they aren't necessarily ugly. When you take any part of yourself and re-orient it toward being beautiful instead of being useful, you are highlighting its feminine element. 

Again, just to clarify, I am NOT equating feminine with female or masculine with male. I am NOT saying females are ""useless and pretty"" and men are ""expendable and ugly."" I am saying that for something to have a certain type of energy is based on how you purpose and view it. A scar is neither inherently masculine or feminine, it's how YOU present it that makes it so."
Existentialism,fpsm7zt,t3_gf8o0y,1588875839.0,"I feel like there is a hidden implication here that bothers me.

1. The universe is meaningless
2. Any statement about the universe is a part of the universe
3. Any statement about the universe is meaningless

This is all true, and I don't think anyone would argue against it here, but then comes the weird implication. 4. Therefore, feeling negative about the universe being pointless is not valid

This implication is backed up by the final sentence ""If this world is a vicious trap, so is its accuser."" Technically it's true in the sense that if the universe is a trap, then everything in it is a trap, but that's vague and not helpful. I also don't think the point the writer is trying to make is a technical one. I believe the point they are trying to make is that it isn't worth dwelling on the fact that the universe is a trap because that is itself a trap.

That isn't especially useful. It invalidates the natural human response to discovering their own absurdity. When someone intellectually understands the meaningless nature of their own existence, yet is unable to avoid desiring meaning, that trap is going to be painful regardless of whether or not you can identify it's a trap. It's like saying ""There is only one path to take, the path is lined with traps, but because there is only one path you should not concern yourself with those traps."" This is obviously incorrect. Just because you can't avoid the traps doesn't mean they won't hurt or cause you harm.

The trap of the universe is absurdity. We need to be happy, but we can't. We need to find meaning, but there is none to find. Distraction is the best hope we have, but no one is truly hopeful about distracting themselves until death. You can't simply stop thinking about it. Once you know it, it comes and goes as it pleases. That is the pain of existing. It shows up in everything you do. Whenever you suffer, you wonder, what is the point of my suffering? Is it at least worth something? When the answer is ""no"" you suffer even more."

DreamInterpretation,fpldxaj,t3_ge30ga,1588710982.0,"There isn't enough context to interpret this dream in a meaningful way. It doesn't mean that you want to have sex with your brother, if that's what you're worried about.

Whatever you were frustrated with him about in the dream, and the fact that he didn't use a condom, those are the keys to the meaning of the dream at the time. You said you were annoyed and mad at him, you never felt turned on. Ask yourself, why would you be having sex with a man (you said you're a lesbian) and why would you be repeatedly having sex with someone when it is annoying you and not turning you on? That is the message here. I can't interpret it for you without more information, I can just point you in the right direction.

I'll give you an example of a subconscious process this sort of dream could arise from, without asserting that this IS the actual source of this particular dream. Again, I don't have enough context to accurately interpret this dream, so my example is just to show you the nature of this sort of dream.

Let's say that you feel particularly sensitive to the way women are viewed sexually in society. Now let's say that your brother, being a man, has a hard time not objectifying women sexually. You think of him as a good guy and you're very close, but this disconnect in your philosophies creates tension. It's tension you ignore because it's not worth arguing about, and you don't want to come across as judgmental, but you do observe and notice the way he thinks about women and it bothers you internally. Your dreams will use him having sex with you as a way of portraying the emotional turmoil you are going through when he expresses this part of himself. Him having sex with you isn't about you wanting to have sex with him, it's about the way his sexual self-expression affects you. In dreams, there is no separation between symbols and feelings, they're the same thing. So your subconscious dream self will not view having sex with your brother as an inappropriate way to symbolize your feelings relating to him and sexuality. In this case, you are representing ""women"" in the dream, because that is what you're reacting to internally. The internal part of you that identifies as ""woman"" is representing itself in the dream and saying ""His sexuality bothers me"" by showing you having sex with him and not feeling good about it. You get the picture.

Once again, I am not making any statements about you or your brother. I don't have enough information. Your brother may respect women and you may think he's a shining example of an ideal man. This isn't the point. The point was to demonstrate for you how dreams work instead of seeing them as literal. I can't tell you why you had that dream, because dreams are about your subconscious and you haven't revealed enough about yourself or your brother, or the dream, for me to know what was going on. What I can tell you is that it wasn't likely about you wanting to have sex with your brother, especially since you didn't even enjoy it in the dream."

The fish represents your curiosity and its intelligence is your desire to learn and grow.

>Second dream: I am in my home with my mom. An old dark man decides to visit me. I seem to know who that person is and I greet him and treat him with respect but my mum seems suspicious.

This works well with my conclusion from the second dream. It sounds like you come from a family you are not entirely aligned with. They may be more traditional or conservative, not necessarily politically. You feel you are being pushed in a direction in life, either by family or by your sense of duty, that you don't actually want to go in.

DreamInterpretation,fos6owf,t3_g98lp7,1588024950.0,"The beginning of the dream is you two getting married. You state in parenthesis for us that you believe you are both ""the one"" for each other. This tells me you both think you are intending to get married, so your subconscious is correct to project this as a possible future outcome.

She meets your family, which seems to go well. Meeting someone's family is a social setting, it also represents deepening the social bond between you and solidifying that you are all part of one family in the dream marriage. In reality, most people are not completely honest around someone else's family, so what your dream family was seeing is what your dream self projected as your girlfriend's social mask. Social masks are designed to be liked by others, so it's no surprise your family liked her. 

Now everything starts to go wrong. She runs off to another country (adventure) with a bodybuilder (masculinity) and she's kissing his neck (sexuality). He is faceless, which means you aren't fearing anyone specific in your life will take her away. Your dream is representing two connected anxieties. First, that she is or will be unsatisfied with you because you can't make her happy. Second, that you can't trust her and you don't know her well enough to truly be in love with her and get married.

Confronting your aunt is interesting. The dream is using this interaction to symbolize the struggle between your naive trust (represented by the aunt, who you believe is a sweet person) and your fear of vulnerability (represented by you being hurt and becoming resentful). The violence here illustrates that these two sides of yourself do not feel that they can co-exist yet, and one of them has to be destroyed. You seeking out the help of your mother shows that you do not feel confident in the situation and you need someone to rely on.

You end up being shot, which is your mind's way of representing the fact that you don't feel prepared to confront the worst possibility, which is the root of your anxiety. Death symbolizes failure and loss of control.

My advice based on your dream is to talk to your mother and aunt about your future with your girlfriend. Ask them for general advice and listen to some of their life experiences in regards to planning a future. Maybe ask them what they wish they would have known to look back on their own lives, before they got married and had children, etc. Your dream isn't directly telling you to consult these two people, but they both play important roles in your life and both of them are people you trust. They're likely to offer a perspective that will enlighten you and help you prepare for possible complications in your future with your girlfriend.

No, they don't. You're misunderstanding my position and mischaracterizing consequentialism. Consequentialism simply means that the consequence is the basis for ethical judgement. If the consequence of you eating grocery store vegan foods is animal cruelty and death, and you say you are against animal cruelty and death, then you are not being principled. I brought up utilitarianism because you brought up math, which is specifically the type of consequentialism you are referring to. Utilitarianism is weighing the worth of pleasure to you and harm to the animals. It attempts to measure the amount of harm caused by you going to the grocery store, and the pleasure or convenience of doing so, and then weighs them against each other. It may then conclude that if the pleasure of going to the store is worth it to cause that harm, but then buying one brand over another causes less harm without reducing your pleasure, that is the optimal choice. I am not a utilitarian. If you are, fine for you, but you should not imply that simply because your choice causes less overall harm than someone else's choice, you are somehow doing more good, when you are STILL making choices to cause more harm than you absolutely have to. Hence, you are not holding a principled position to judge anyone else's position from. You're hypocritical in your logic.

> If I am of the egg eating sort and I am considering swearing off of eggs, but I still wish to bake, does the Flax industry cause more or less harm?

Ok, but you're not taking into consideration the fact that you aren't aiming at absolute minimum harm. Why not? Because it's more convenient for you to shop at the grocery store and buy from huge companies with immoral practices than it is to grow all your own foods. So is that the least harm you can do? No. Just because you do any calculation at all doesn't mean you are somehow making an objectively moral choice. You are living by your own values, nothing more, just like everyone else on the planet is doing by default. You favor grocery shopping over living more purely. Some people value the flavor of meat over causing death. Those are personal choices.

You're making exceptions for yourself you aren't making for others, and you're arbitrarily setting the line for what is moral at EXACTLY where you stand. That's hypocritical and honestly just immature.

The reality of the situation is that we should all be doing our best to start including more ethical practices in how we treat animals and any other living thing. Still, people need to eat and it isn't easy to feed billions of people without some questionable practices. Those are real decisions that real people have to make, which is why you'll go to the grocery store and eat a vegan burger that was made with unethical practices. To then turn around and judge everyone else because they're drinking milk or eating animals is hypocritical and divisive. 

Unlike the vegan community, which is pretty universally hated by everyone except for other vegans, I do not judge others for their personal choices such as eating meat, or not eating animal products. Everyone has their own tolerance for how much harm they're willing to cause others in order to benefit themselves. I make choices that I am willing to live with morally, and I don't assume that I am the universal judge of moral good. Neither should you, because you aren't. It's also literally impossible to feed the whole world at this point without causing ANY harm at all, so we have to deal with things as they are, not as they should be.

I choose to be a vegetarian because I know I wouldn't have the heart to kill an animal unless it was necessary for my survival. As a result, I don't allow anyone else to do that killing for me either. That doesn't mean I think eating an animal is inherently wrong. I do encourage others to genuinely consider the ethical consequences of their choices and what they really believe, but unlike you I don't judge them for their choices and talk down to them. For what it's worth, animals eat other animals, and even plants eat animals (i.e. predatory plants) so far be it from me to think humans are uniquely evil for doing what every single living thing does.

In the end, I want us to reduce unnecessary harm. There's no need to treat animals horribly and make them live in terrible conditions. A cow producing milk should be seen as a worker and protected by some sort of animal worker rights. As a living thing, we shouldn't be allowed to treat it unethically, just like we wouldn't treat someone working in a factory unethically and cruelly. That doesn't mean domesticating a cow and collecting its milk while taking care of it and protecting it are automatically unethical in my opinion."

The point is that we need to find BETTER ways to co-exist with other living things, which starts with not trying to cause them harm whenever possible. Rather than focusing on a holier than thou attitude that really turns people off from veganism, I think it's more important to focus on the underlying principle that we should improve the way we treat all living things and minimize the harm we do to them.

I don't have any feeling telling me where to go anymore. My whole life I was drawn to two things. Investing intensely in idealistic love, and searching for a meaningful and beautiful grand truth about the universe and myself. Forgive what will come across as ego, but I have essentially solved the philosophical mysteries of the universe, with some limitation and exception. I needed to find a loving god. There is no loving god. I needed to find purpose to existence. There is no purpose. I needed to find a special and personal destiny I could fulfill that would be meaningful and exciting. Life is mostly pointless suffering. As for romance, I did find love, but it wasn't the life-pervading, all consuming love I had hoped for. My partner is the best person I have ever met, and I am deeply grateful for her, but she (INFP 5w4) doesn't want to spend all her free time and energy on loving me. That's fair. No one does, or did. At least someone genuinely loves me, but there is no pursuit of oneness or intense intimacy. We're just sort of living life together, which is cute, but I never liked life to begin with. I was desperate for something other than just life.

With these developments, I do not see what there is left to pursue. I will not break up with my partner, who is a good person, sweet partner, honest, loyal, smart, beautiful, and creative. She's the best person out there and it would be suicide for me to take her for granted. Most of the time I don't even think I deserve her. Still, with ""truth"" and ""love"" both being at their limits, here I stand unfulfilled. Sometimes I get glimmers of hope, but mostly life seems cruel. I am bitter, lonely, unmotivated, and bored.

> ""If everything around seems dark... look again... You may be the light."" -Rumi. When I say the INFJ is a star, I do mean it with a similar intention as how you described it. To a star, everything around them is darkness, the abyss, because they are the source of light. Additionally, to the common-person, to stare at the sun is going to be harsh, intense, unpleasant, because oftentimes the truth is unpleasant.

That's a very lovely quote, but it's easy to say. I'm not so easily convinced. As I increasingly become depressed and resentful of the world, I give off less and less light. Kindness does not come free. Something far too familiar to a 2w1 and INFJ. People think it's manipulative to expect something in return for the love and effort you give. It's not manipulation, it's necessity. The world wants to parasitize you and drain your life force while simultaneously judging you for expecting reciprocated investment and intent. No. I won't continue to be anyone's light as long as the world is cold and predatory. I don't owe anyone anything. Even the sun will burn out when it stops being nurtured by the universe. Stars are not altruistic and neither am I.

> The ENFP is willing to put in the investment because they're always thinking in terms of best-case scenarios. Once they can see the possibility of a life-long, happy companionship with that person, they'll dedicate themself to that person, through the hard times.

Skeptical. It's vague. In everyone's mind, their version of love is good. The difficulties in relationships come from needing to love someone their way instead of your way. I just don't see an ENFP ever being satisfied staying at home having sex and conversations all day. ENFP's need an audience to impress. They need status and adoration from the crowd. You're playing too much into the fantasy. It's not realistic.

> I believe your INFJ is yin: negative, pessimistic, stuck in overthinking because of their demonic 8th Si function and the corresponding Ni feelings of those memories.

This is interesting. I would like to learn more about this.

> The ENFP sees the INFJ as the light and will show them how bright they shine.

You're only focusing on what the ENFP likes about the INFJ. No one lives their life for anyone else. What does the ENFP get out of it? Yes, you say that once they learn to be by themselves they can be happy, but why would someone go against their own nature just to be with someone else? Why wouldn't the ENFP do what ENFP's seem to do, and attempt to juggle the INFJ, keeping them on the back burner, while exploring lots of other connections so they can get the most out of their group?

> The ENFP's love of adventure will help the INFJ get out of the house, back into nature and museums and all sorts of places, without the anxiety of being in a group because the ENFP just needs an adventure buddy.

ENFP's aren't exactly planners though, and INFJ's aren't extroverted or desiring of adventure. It seems more likely that the ENFP would rely on the INFJ to take the lead, and if the INFJ didn't provide this sort of extroverted opportunity for exploration, the ENFP would become bored and either cheat on them or find friends to spend their adventure time with who will make it easier to have passive experiences.

> The INFJ may worry about all the ways the relationship could go wrong, but the ENFP sees the possibility where it goes right and lives off that.

The INFJ's intuition is quite the divine oracle. Blind optimism isn't charming to me. The ENFP may feel good imagining all the great possibilities, but the INFJ isn't going to feel good until living in a believable happy reality. The problem with selling someone a dream is that it tends to deflate once you try to live in it. ENFP's are perhaps one of the worst at this. They make huge promises with absolutely no ability to follow through.

entp,fmizy5j,t1_fmimwqr,1586120269.0,"This thread is quickly becoming exhausting for me. I find that I am acting more as an educator than a debate partner, whereby my primary job is to introduce people to concepts that are already established at a higher level, but I'm basically having to summarize the work for people who aren't familiar. Likewise, I find that everyone seems to be deeply struggling with understanding the nature of panpsychism, resulting in them arguing past me instead of with me. I don't intend to continue replying to people here, because it's becoming unrewarding for me, but I do want to at least respond to your post because you clearly put so much effort into writing it and I think that deserves some feedback. I probably won't elaborate a ton though, sorry.

> The definition you have provided is exceptionally broad, and invariably leads to not only the question 'what is being?'

Yes, you're absolutely right, but these questions are already elaborated upon in writing about panpsychism and consciousness. I already have a deeper understanding of my own definition of what is being, which is subtly different than mainstream panpsychism, but without any pre-existing infrastructure to work with I'm basically forced to re-explain all of panpsychic theory and that's not what I signed up to do. The definition is fine once you understand what is meant by consciousness within the context being discussed. Which is your job.

> A more technical definition still, is one rooted in physiology, ""the state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings"".

This is, no offense, a horrible definition for discussing panpsychism and consciousness. It doesn't address the actual philosophical questions being asked and yes, does assume an answer already. It's a totally different kind of consciousness and one that I'm not particularly interested in. 

> In medicine they do not use brain activity as a the indicator of consciousness, but assessments like the glascow coma scale

Once again... this is NOT THE SAME KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS I AM DISCUSSING. Please familiarize yourself with panpsychism more so you understand the notion of consciousness being discussed. You are talking about a completely different topic that is irrelevant here. It's like talking about light within the context of special relativity vs the context of flipping the switch in your living room. You're changing the topic to something useless to me, I'm sorry for being blunt, but it's the frustration I've accumulated from trying to talk to people about this in this thread for a while now.

> Reading through the other posts, you mention that the source you are using to define your position rejects 'emergence theory'. I am unfamiliar with the reference, but I would like to understand on what grounds you reject emergent properties.

It's not the source I am using, it's me. I reject strong emergence theory, I am the source of my own ideas. The reason I'm quoting other things like Wikipedia is because I'm so fucking exhausted from constantly repeating already established ideas that no one here is remotely familiar with or cares to research before trying to debate the topic. Please further research the hard problem of consciousness, panpsychism, and strong emergence theory. 

> so, if I was to examine this in terms of ""[nurological] activity generate consciousness the ability to experience being."" I would say that because the nervous system (supported by other physiological systems) is comprised of receptors that take in signals from the external world, a system of nerves send those signals to the central nervous system, which then process the information into ""experiences"", such as self-awareness.

That doesn't explain anything. The nervous system is simply an electrical system. If I attach a sensory receptor to a computer so it can intake information from the external world and process it centrally, are you also going to assume the computer has conscious self-experience? Of course you aren't, but your explanation doesn't go beyond that, you're just making a leap of faith that because it's happening within a biological system that the biology somehow magics the consciousness into existence even though none of the processes or parts you described give rise to consciousness even when added together.

> Absolutely not, a brain wave (oscillation) is a function of membrane or action potential, we can model that function using a computer, but the a computer is not doing that function it is displaying information that is coded into it using binary and logic gates.

This is just flat out wrong. I am tired of correcting factually wrong information.

""Scientists just created an algorithm capable of performing a complete human brain simulation. Now we just have to wait for someone to build a computer powerful enough to run it."" -[source](https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/03/22/theres-an-algorithm-to-simulate-our-brains-too-bad-no-computer-can-run-it/)

You are also incorrect that it matters what the origin of the brain wave is so long as the brain wave (or the electrical activity that generates it) itself is the medium. Likewise, chemical communication is still a communication of basic logical values. An ion pump is about as basically logical as you can get. A brain wave is an electromagnetic wave. I don't care what created it, it's still an electromagnetic wave and the information it caries is limited by the medium. You're once again trying to magically explain how the brain's biological nature generates consciousness, but your reason doesn't hold up.

> The nervous system, particularly the brain itself is exceptionally complex

Not really, not for the sake of what we are discussing. What you seem to be missing is that the important part here is the nature of the elements at work. To give an example, it's like saying that writing can be simple or complex, but the complexity of the writing is irrelevant to whether or not that writing does magic. Just because a magic incantation is complex does not allow it to disobey the laws of physics or logic. While the brain can be considered complex as a machine, the elements at work in the brain are exceedingly simple. Electricity and chemicals. Electricity can do amazing things, like operate your iphone, but it doesn't generate consciousness. No matter how complex the electrical network, consciousness is not the natural result because there is nothing about electricity that contains and generates the property of consciousness. When you open up your iphone, everything the electricity is doing is predictable because it's doing what electricity should do. When you open up a brain, electricity is still doing the same thing it does in your iphone, except magically the result is a self-aware existence. Your explanation seems to be ""it's complex"" but that's basically the neurological equivalent of ""god of the gaps argument"" by religion. You're pointing at the whole brain and saying ""concscoiusness!"" because you can't point to any specific element or property at work within the brain that explains how it becomes conscious of anything that's happening. No matter how many times or in what way you process input, there is no reason you should be conscious of it that can be found in the brain.

> I agree with the u/El_Baron_Blanco observation that the discourse on panpsychism is logically flawed by suggesting that ""all life is conscious because [it defines] consciousness as a qualia all life has.""... There are no answers here, just circular reasoning.

To argue this point is beyond ignorant. I can't tolerate you people anymore.

1. I didn't suggest all life is consciousness because I defined consciousness as a qualia of life, your brain is broken
2. I defined consciousness as the ability to have an experience of being. Life and an experience of being are two different definitions, not that you would understand that. Here is an example definition of life, since I have to do all your homework for you. ""the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death."" -Google. Please point out where ""consciousness"" or ""an experience of being"" is listed in that basic definition of life. Actually don't, because I won't be reading your reply. Here's another definition for you from Wikipedia. I know these are obscure websites that would have been hard for you to look up, but I'm sure in the future if you want to insult someone's intelligence like you have done with mine, you'll put in the extra effort to find these scholarly sources for yourself so you can be educated on the topic before you speak on it. ""Life is a characteristic that distinguishes physical entities that have biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased (they have died), or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate."" -Wikipedia
3. If YOU are defining ""life"" as having consciousness, then YOU are the one automatically assuming consciousness is a qualia for life. Even if that is the case, it doesn't prevent a debate about the actual topic at hand, which is WHAT CAUSES CONSCIOUSNESS not what fucking defines life."

Even if it was unhealthy, not everyone can become healthy in the eyes of traditional social views.

With your ""stage"" based model of personal actualization, how are you supposed to go through those stages? Are you supposed to meet people with those types and learn from them? Research their types and contemplate them? Try to mimic or behave like those types for a period of time? Is it something that naturally happens for each type without attempting it consciously?

I suppose it's true for almost everyone that at some point they settle down, but that doesn't necessarily change the fundamental motivations of that person. The character I am describing, based on myself, is very fragile and in a great deal of existential pain. You portrayed the INFJ as a star, shining brightly into the darkness. That is true on some levels, but perhaps it is more true that the INFJ contemplates the void and allows its darkness to flow into themselves. The pessimism you spoke of is a result of INFJ's seeking the deepest possible truth. Upon discovering this truth is terrifying, the INFJ is reluctant to look away, because the truth is all we really have. We stare too long into the abyss and we become victimized by its cold, heartless nature. We see it in everything around us. We see it in ourselves. We see it in you. From this point on, we can not return to optimism. We can not be cheered up. We can only share our soul, tainted as it is. Its flavor is hardly enticing. Fascinating, perhaps, but not for keeping. No one keeps the demonic artifact on their bookshelf, overlooking their vulnerable family and pets. They keep it somewhere safe and visit it only when they are curious about its power. 

It seems to me that what ENFP's do best is romanticize INFJ's understanding of yourselves. You never feel more understood and accepted than with an INFJ. If we can confront the black heart of existence without flinching, we won't judge your mischievous habits. Our understanding of the intuitive aspects of philosophy and science allows us to breathe life into your own ideas in ways you can not easily do on your own. To show you that the Ne seeds you plant in such a carefree manner could actually be grown into spectacular and wondrous trees. Not that you will necessarily pursue this, but it is of great comfort to know it is possible and meaningful.

I don't think an ENFP wants to tend to a broken genius, alone in a house with an introvert who doesn't want to leave, or be left. The ENFP would suffocate. I think the ENFP wants to know that this particular INFJ is theirs. That it will be available to them indefinitely for intimacy and exploration. I'm not sure that's what I was looking for in my story. My INFJ needs saving. Needs forceful loving and guidance. Needs someone who believes in them and shows them the way to overcome their own suffering. I'm not sure the ENFP has the patience for that sort of investment. The ENFP seems more likely to visit regularly with the INFJ and poke or prod them to see if they've made progress, and what that progress has to offer the ENFP in terms of experience. Experience they would delight in sharing with others, which is what they truly thrive in doing. Sharing with others what they've learned from their many unique relationships and connections.

I'm highly doubtful such an MBTI or Enneagram exists that would care for my character. It's not anyone else's fault. It's just the way things are."
DreamInterpretation,fmfdmws,t3_fuvw92,1586025051.0,">so it was idk this school but there was a baseball field so me and like 3 were chilling at the baseball field, there’s a game going behind us.

The baseball field is a place representing social-masculine-competition. You put yourself here because it represents your internal conflicts with your masculine self, especially as it relates to society. The social part is emphasized by the fact that it's a school, because school is the most social element of our teen and pre-teen years, which often talks about the social element of our inner child and how it experiences social environments.

>All the sudden there’s a bunch of screams, this random stranger of a girl ripped herself apart killing herself while she was on hardcore hallucination drugs

The girl is your feminine self. She is ripping herself apart and killing herself because you are killing the feminine part of yourself. The ""hallucination drugs"" represent that this is coming from a place of internal mental struggle and shattered internal mental paradigms. We experience altered states of mind on drugs, so you view the process of attacking your internal feminine self as an altered state of mind. Possibly due to it being seen as a mental illness by some, I don't know you well enough to say more.

>but for some reason I turned around and the dream transported to my house kinda, it was like my house but a different layout but everything my house has

Your house represents your internal world, private life, and family life. The fact that the house isn't exactly how you remember it is likely a metaphor for internal chaos, but it can also be just an imperfect memory of your home's layout projected into the dream.

>The pieces of her are being thrown out by the baseball players behind the gates and I keep running into the ones that have pieces of her.

The pieces of her are pieces of yourself. The players on the baseball team, unless you know them personally, represent strong masculine figures in society and in your social life. The way they are coldly treating the pieces of the girl, which was your internal feminine self, is how you feel the world is processing your trauma. They don't care. You feel disconnected, like people are watching you kill yourself and they just want to keep playing their game while ignoring you.

>I’m running, my friends are running, and it’s really through this obstacle course thing, not dangerous, but a lot of hardcore parkour and all, and at one point I’m swinging from the bridge.

The fact that your friends are running with you shows that you feel some people support you and are on your side. You're not completely alone and they are willing to face challenges with you. The parkour is just an expression of overcoming challenges.

>Im running as fast as possible to get away from the world and then I wind up in my? New layout of a house. And I have to avoid my living room.

Avoiding your living room is a mistake. You're too afraid of what happened, and you feel disconnected from it, which is why the girl was a stranger. This implies you are not fully processing your emotions, which can be dangerous. You're trying to compartmentalize your feelings so you can avoid them.

>I run around avoiding it but my friends keep checking it out and trying to find a cause and the house feels so scary, my mom and my dad and my stepmom and my family is in this dream by now

Your friends checking it out and trying to find the cause may imply that your friends are more willing to face your inner demons than you are, and that they are trying to encourage you to understand yourself, but you are ignoring the opportunity because you're afraid.

>there’s these two gay guys, I go downstairs to their living room I guess and he goes “why are you in here?”

This is impostor syndrome. The gay male community can be very judgmental at times, and it's easy to feel socially rejected. You specifically chose gay males because of their trope of being judgmental and harsh as a group. You feel socially isolated and you don't feel like you belong.

>I wash my hands except it was with charcoal toothpaste for some reason and it won’t come off on the water I’m freaking out. I’m freaking out the guys are talking bout me in such a sinister way like let’s frame him and then kill him.

This is more impostor syndrome. You feel like you are uniquely ill equipped for social life. You're making a fool of yourself and trying to cover it up. This describes your internal experience, because you are alone in a bathroom. Yet the experience is specifically about how you think society and specifically the ""catty gay male"" archetype views you. You'll be singled out and violently rejected from the group for not belonging.

>And I freak out, dry the charcoal on their towels and run out the room and they’re gone but I see them in the living room she died in.

You feel exposed and vulnerable. The energy they represent, that sort of judgmental social force you fear, is now in the place you are afraid of. You feel they will find your weakness, expose it, and use it against you. This also parallels the masculine force of the baseball players who were part of the setting where your feminine ""stranger"" self committed suicide on drugs. All of this means that you do not have a healthy relationship with masculinity, especially in a social context.

&#x200B;

>To me, I gotta keep avoiding that room eventually I realize I have no glasses on in my dream, and everything’s blurry and so I have to run to my room and I can’t put the glasses on it’s a struggle. My room feels terrifying so I eventually get them on and I run back out.

The glasses are associated with vision. You can not see into your future. You don't have a plan, and you don't know where you're going. You feel lost and in a panic. The fear is spreading to other rooms of your house. The house represents your internal world and psyche. Anxiety is taking over and threatening you wherever you go. No place is safe for long.

>I get upstairs to this lounge/bedroom and lay on the bed, and this movie is playing and it features my uncle and the girl who died

Your dream is trying to tell you that your uncle had something to do with the girl dying. I won't speculate about what that might be. It could be a coincidence, or it could be that you love your uncle and something about his energy/lessons can help you heal the dead girl. I'd need to know more about your relationship with your uncle to say. My first guess would be that your uncle is a negative character, not a positive one, and that his energy is associated with the cause of the girl's death. The movie playing is a representation of a memory, not usually the future. As a result, I speculate it has something to do with what happened in your past involving your uncle. Something he said, or did, that affected you and damaged your inner feminine self. You didn't mention being afraid of your uncle or that movie, so it's hard to tell.

>and then it suddenly transports to us in the living room she died in and then I woke up

Choosing to transport you to the living room instead of the baseball field is specifically focusing in on your internal/family life instead of your social life. This is connecting the dot with your uncle.

I would interpret this whole story in summary as: Something with your uncle caused you to kill your feminine self. In doing so, you now feel alienated from society and have developed an unhealthy relationship with masculinity. You feel like an impostor and are struggling with anxiety.

These are all assumptions. I don't know you well enough to interpret your dreams without more context, but that is how I would categorize the story being shown to you by your subconscious. It wants you to process your emotions, which you are failing to do. Please help the girl by balancing yourself internally. Your inner female feels like she has been murdered by her family, and your inner male feels like he is an impostor who will be murdered by society. To help them both, you have to sit with your emotions. Go back to the living room, figuratively, and allow the ghosts of your past to speak to you. Meditate on that for a few days and see where it takes you. Visually go back into the room in your mind and focus on your emotional reactions.

Best of luck to you. I hope my interpretation was useful and interesting."
enfj,fmf9n7o,t1_fmf7v5j,1586022713.0,"So here is my thing with ENFP's. I have seen videos and read articles about ENFP's gushing over INFJ's, but I dated an ENFP girl years ago and it was a very traumatic experience. She was extremely dishonest, cared more about getting the attention of the crowd or other guys than me, cheated on me multiple times, lied, and was extremely inauthentic. I understand it's not fair to judge an entire group by just one girl, but every time I watch an ENFP video, they have the same sort of tone and facial expressions she did. It always feels like they're more interested in how good they look to everyone instead of really connecting with anyone in particular for extended periods of time. ENFP's have been burned into my mind as social whores. I am truly sorry if that's not what you're like at all. I would hate to be judged that way by someone else, but I can not help the way that experience effected me. It was also right at the time I was getting into MBTI. 

I do think an 8 enneagram is ideal. I also agree no one's life is going to be about just helping and taking care of my character. My character is very intelligent and giving. An INFJ 2w1 like me. As a result, there will be an endless amount of reward for their partner, but here's the catch. The INFJ is heavily damaged and not functional or ""healthy"" as people irritatingly keep referring to it. The INFJ can not keep a full time job, has deep existential depression, anxiety, and is very clingy. I thought if I went into the fictional world I could find a character archetype who would realistically want to be with that person, but it seems that isn't the case. Even though the character doesn't do drugs, doesn't have a drinking problem, and isn't totally worthless like everyone seems to assume. For example, the character is brilliant and very helpful within the context of their relationship. Still, no one seems to want them. When you can't even write a fictional character who wants a character based on you, it's very sad.

I will read the link you gave me about ENFP/INFJ and I'm happy to hear any thoughts you have on the topic, but it will be very difficult for me to overcome my ENFP trauma and imagine the type as anything other than a social butterfly who will abandon me or my character at the drop of a hat to get attention from someone more interesting."

1. Can complex, reproducing forms evolve from simple forms?
2. Can consciousness emerge from unconscious materials?

The first part of the question, which is what a lot of religious people are really arguing, isn't hotly debated. It hasn't been proven yet that our bodies did come from self-replicating chemicals, but it's pretty close to being proven and the groundwork has already been laid.

The second part of the question, about consciousness, is exactly what we're discussing. Unlike the evolution of complex self-replicating forms from simple self-replicating forms, consciousness is a much more difficult and hotly debated topic. The two leading theories are panpsychism, which has been gaining a lot of supporters in philosophy and science, and emergence theory. Emergence theory is broken up into two parts.

""Usage of the notion ""emergence"" may generally be subdivided into two perspectives, that of ""weak emergence"" and ""strong emergence"". One paper discussing this division is Weak Emergence, by philosopher Mark Bedau. In terms of physical systems, weak emergence is a type of emergence in which the emergent property is amenable to computer simulation or similar forms of after-the-fact analysis (for example, the formation of a traffic jam, the structure of a flight of starlings or a school of fishes, or the formation of galaxies). Crucial in these simulations is that the interacting members retain their independence. If not (for example in a chemical reaction), a new entity is formed with new, emergent properties: this is called strong emergence, which it is argued cannot be simulated or analysed."" -Wiki on Emergence theory

Strong emergence theory is considered by many to be unscientific. Not on ""spiritual"" grounds, but according to basic logical principles.

""Although strong emergence is logically possible, it is uncomfortably like magic. How does an irreducible but supervenient downward causal power arise, since by definition it cannot be due to the aggregation of the micro-level potentialities? Such causal powers would be quite unlike anything within our scientific ken. This not only indicates how they will discomfort reasonable forms of materialism. Their mysteriousness will only heighten the traditional worry that emergence entails illegitimately getting something from nothing."" -Mark A. Bedau

entp,fmcd1hx,t1_fmc5ehy,1585943337.0,"> Ok, then let's go back to that. Why is ""what is it like to be stone?"" a meaningful question and not a misapplication of a concept?

What it is like to be a stone isn't really the point of my argument, but it is an example of a question that is important to ask for the sake of expanding the meaning of consciousness. If consciousness is generated by the brain, then it came into being in an unconscious world. This is extraordinarily difficult to explain, given the fact that there is no obvious reason that unconscious parts should generate a conscious result. As I stated in another reply to someone else, you wouldn't expect a brainwave pattern perfectly simulated in a lab, or on a computer, to generate consciousness. So why do we assume the brainwave inside a brain is doing it? The brain is chemicals and energy, same as everything else in the universe. It is easier to explain consciousness as pre-existing. Something that is focused and magnified by the structures and workings of the brain. The easier explanation is usually the better one, which is known as Occam's razor. The reason being that the more complexity required to explain something, the more likely it is that you're forcing the explanation to work.

As for the stone, it's just one example of asking the question: why do we assume consciousness is unique to the brain? We have no reason to assume that basic level consciousness, or the ability to have an experience, is only present in the brain or caused by brain activity. It's a case of mistaken identity. We're pointing at the brain activity and saying ""That must be consciousness!"" when in reality consciousness is what makes us aware of brain activity. Think for a moment. How much brain activity aren't we aware of? Look into examples like split brain syndrome. In split brain, the connective tissue that allows the right and left hemispheres of the brain to communicate is disconnected. This causes the left and right sides of the brain to operate independently of each other. The result is fascinating. Thoughts that occur in one side of the brain are segregated from thoughts that occur on the other side. When both sides of the brain are tested, they come up with different answers to the same question based on what faculties they have access to. This is not consistent with the hypothesis that brain activity is the origin of consciousness. Each side of the brain can have separate thoughts, and the individual with split brain syndrome can believe both sides simultaneously despite their conflicting conclusion. If consciousness is generated by brain activity, how can something like this be possible? 

I think people mistake consciousness for the part of the brain that mimics self-reflection. There are systems and functions within the brain that are designed to edit and review its own processes. I think those brain functions act like a mirror, reflecting the consciousness inherent to all things, including rocks. The rock doesn't have that kind of mirror built into its biology, so it won't have the same kind of experience a person does. That doesn't mean the brain alone is sufficient to explain conspicuousness. It simply isn't. There is absolutely nothing about the brain that can't be reduced to basic building blocks. The brain wave, in isolation, is absolutely nothing but an electromagnetic wave. If that is consciousness, then at the very least don't you have to admit that electricity somehow contains consciousness?"

> I chose to start with a more technical definition of consciousness that I am familiar with

I understand, but the problem with your definition of consciousness is that it makes it synonymous with brain activity. You're assuming the answer in the definition, which makes it pointless to debate. Also, that definition doesn't answer any of the important questions about consciousness. For example, if consciousness did not exist prior to brain activity, why does brain activity generate consciousness? The brain is a material object and there is nothing special about any of its activities. They are biological and electrical. If the brain is conscious, what is that consciousness made of? The biological, electrical, or both? Why do unconscious parts make a conscious whole? How is something being added (consciousness) by combining two unconscious things?

A brain wave can be simulated on a computer quite easily. If the same exact brain signal is simulated on a computer, would you assume the computer is now conscious? How about if I repeat the brain wave with pure electricity in a non-biological medium in a lab? Is the electricity conscious? There are no answers here, just physical phenomena."

> If there's not much to feel like to be a rock it means there's at least something to feel like to be a rock, that is we'd have to admit that stones are organisms if we play by Nagel's rules.

Why are you going in this direction? This has nothing to do with anything. I did not say Nagel's conclusion was correct, I said his wording is the inspiration for the definition of consciousness used. Panpsychism merely applies that definition to everything. You're wasting time trying to argue against a straw man. I never claimed only living biological organisms have consciousness and that is not what I believe. That is also not the standard definition of panpsychism.

""the doctrine or belief that everything material, however small, has an element of individual consciousness."" -Dictionary definition of Panpsychism

Please stay within the purpose of the debate and do not distract from the actual topic.

As for whether a stone has an experience. Yes, it does. The point is that it doesn't mean much to experience being a stone because there is no faculty. There are no sensory organs or anything to generate/process meaningful data, and there is no simulated self-reflection such as is generated by the brain activity of advanced organisms. As such, the experience of ""being a rock"" would likely be a bit like watching a movie with the TV monitor off and the sound muted. It doesn't matter what's happening to the rock if the rock has no way of perceiving it. That doesn't mean the experience of nothingness isn't an experience. Anything observable can be experienced, and nothingness is observable as an experience. Just ask people who are not dreaming while asleep. They're alive and even their brain is firing, but they have no experience of being alive during that time. That is the experience of nothingness.

Stones not being a form of life is irrelevant. That's based on your misunderstanding of panpsychism by using Nagel's conclusion instead of his definition.

> How can you have an experience without thought? I fail to see how consciousness and the ability to think are not intrinsically linked.

Thought isn't the experience. It is experienced. The underlying experience is just the passive awareness of what is or isn't happening. Thoughts describe the experience and analyze it. They abstract the experience and they render it symbolically through shapes and images, etc. You're actually making an interesting point in my favor here. Not all living things have the capacity for active thought. A single celled organism, for example, doesn't have a brain or the ability to render images or language. How would it think in the way you're familiar with? Yet it's clearly alive. While I can't prove anything is conscious from the outside, we can assume that if a single celled organism is conscious it certainly has an experience because it even has primitive sensory input and output. So at the very least the experience sans thought is possible, even if I can't prove it's happening. Thought is a byproduct of the higher brain functions. The ones that look inward and self-reflect on what is happening. They shouldn't be confused with experience.

Here is another example. When you react to your hand being burned on a stove top, you pull the hand away using information processed in your spine, not your brain. Your spine controls the behavior from start to finish. Only after the hand has already been pulled away do you begin to formulate thoughts about the experience as the data is processed in the brain. If the spine can control behavior, it can certainly facilitate an experience without the brain, but the brain is necessary for thought.

> I could ask a similar question -- what reason do we have to believe that sociality is observed in humans and other animals but not in bacteria?

Sociality is observed in bacteria, and sociality is not observed in all humans.

> The reason to believe that conscious activity can be observed in some configurations of matter but not in others is that we have evidence for consciousness in some configurations of matter but not in others.

Incorrect. The only evidence we have of consciousness is our own experience. We have ZERO evidence of consciousness in any other form. You can not in any way prove that I am conscious, and I can not in any way prove you are conscious. We have literally one data point and the rest are assumptions. Likewise, I can assume with the same amount of evidence that everything is conscious. The one data point does not in any way contradict either conclusions, so there is no proof of anything for either side. Consciousness can not be empirically measured. This is well accepted within the philosophical debate. Even neuroscientists do not believe that brain activity is proof of consciousness, they are different things.

> The limits of our faculties haven't stopped us from investigating reality, we're merely aware of them and factor them into our theories.

We investigate what we can observe. We can not observe consciousness. The scientific method requires an experiment and data. We have no experiment we can perform on consciousness, which makes it the realm of philosophy not science. There's nothing wrong with exploring and investigating reality, but don't mistake philosophical assumptions for scientific proof. We simply don't know what consciousness is, how it works, or if it's real in anyone else yet.

> Which probably explains why the hard problem of consciousness remains such a big issue. I wouldn't be surprised if the solution is to dissolve the problem rather than solve it.

This makes me sad for humanity.

> I wouldn't. But I might be inclined to consider the computer having experiences by your own definition. What's the difference between a non-thinking organism having experiences (since you think thought isn't relevant) and a non-thinking computer receiving data input?

That's right, the computer is having experience by my definition, but you don't get to adopt my definition only when it's convenient and disagree with it every other time. The difference between the experience of any two things is their faculties and processes. Especially those key processes and faculties which allow for the eventual self-reflection of consciousness. The more the processes and faculties act like mirrors for consciousness, the more self-aware a thing becomes.

> Just to be clear, when I called it daring it wasn't meant to be kind -- I think you made an unwarranted leap here.

That's fine.

> ...then I fail to see how consciousness can be the answer here, as consciousness would be part of the universe (by definition) and as such, would also be essentially information. Why should information be able to store other information?

No. Consciousness is not information. Consciousness is the experience of information. It is also not part of the universe, the universe exists within consciousness. Like a simulation on a computer. The computer isn't IN the simulation, it IS the simulation. It contains the simulation.

The quickest way to explain this is to have you imagine a state of zero information. Imagine absolute nothingness. No data. It can be experienced. The experience might not be complex or interesting, but it can be experienced. Nothingness is a state of being. Consciousness, by itself, with absolutely nothing else, generates all the information in the universe through its own states of being. Its states of being do not become information until consciousness experiences them. I understand this language is confusing, so I'll try to use another approach.

Let's take a single unit of information. We'll call it zero. Zero is the base unit of all information. Zero, when unobserved, does not act like information. You can not hold zero. You can not look at zero. If zero is all there is, then there is nothing. Now let's apply an observer to zero. What is zero when observed? Well, it's still nothing, but it's also something. The observation catalyzes zero into somethingness. A state of ""all potential."" For example, if I add digits to zero like this 00000 we have five zeroes. What does it mean to have five of nothing? Well, without an observer, it doesn't mean anything. With an observer, you can have five of nothing. How about 0 = 1 - 1? Without an observer, these are just states of nothing that don't exist. With an observer, they are separate states. 1 is not 0. -1 is not zero. Yet 1 - 1 is zero. Zero contains the potential for all other information. However, zero does not become activated as information itself until it is observed. How can something be information in one state, but not information in another? It isn't. Zero is always information because zero is always observed. Consciousness is always present in everything. Zero exists within consciousness, because without consciousness zero has no active element, it is not information, it is the absence of information. With consciousness, zero becomes the seed for all existence and information. Consciousness isn't information itself, it is the catalyst of information. When consciousness observes information, information becomes real. Without a consciousness, information would not be real. Consciousness is the substrate within which information exists."

Using a very different definition of consciousness than the one we are discussing here, so it's not applicable. You're talking about ""lights on"" consciousness. I am talking about a deeper meaning of consciousness as I defined in my original post.

> As such there is some evidence that consciousness is (at the very least, linked to) brain function, and as there is no empirical evidence that it is not than it would be more reasonable to understand consciousness as a product of physiology than it would be to assume that physiology plays no particular role in consciousness.

No. You can not empirically measure consciousness, only brain activity, which is not the same thing. Please google philosophical zombie. ELI5 - if the people you saw in the world didn't have any actual experience, but they had all the same brain activity and behavior, you could never know they didn't have an actual experience. Your brain scans would tell you that their body is functioning with their brain, but that says absolutely nothing about actual consciousness. 

Another way to look at it is, an fMRI is like looking into a window of the brain. Electrical activity is like the lights being on in the brain. A person being in the room to experience the lights being on or off is consciousness. If you see through the window the lights are going on and off, and you measure that it's correlated with the switch on the wall being flipped, that just tells you the switch controls the lights. It doesn't say anything about the light being associated with someone being inside the room to see them turning on or off.

It's a common one used in panpsychist debate. It's kind of the standard definition of philosophical consciousness at this point. Most people attribute it to Thomas Nagel.

> I suppose this includes sophisticated versions of experiencing being as well as simple versions, like animal consciousness, but wouldn't include bacteria and viruses.

Not in my conception, no. I believe everything has an experience of what it is to be self-observing that state. For most things the state of being X is basically nothingness because they have no sensory input. For example, it wouldn't feel like much to be a rock, but that doesn't mean there isn't a form of consciousness present in the rock. That's why I defined consciousness first, because people not familiar with panpsychism often get confused and automatically assume by consciousness I mean something to do with higher consciousness like the ability to think, which isn't what I mean. Consciousness is simply the ability to have an experience. So if you think about human consciousness for example, all the advanced faculties that make it a really advanced and complex experience aren't the point. We're not debating complex consciousness, we're debating the source of consciousness. Regardless of how complex the faculties of a human are, how is it that a human is even aware of its faculties in the first place? How does consciousness emerge from brain activity if brain activity is made up of the same components that make up unconscious matter according to the standard view? In other words, what reason do we have to believe that some organic molecules and electricity will generate the ability to be self-aware and have an experience if we don't believe that the organic molecules and electricity themselves have any experience?

> Furthermore, you're doing the opposite of what is usually done when a technical term gets defined -- instead of offering a specific, narrow definition you're offering a very broad one.

I'm offering the best definition we have available in the field of philosophy right now. Again, it's based on the essay ""What Is It Like to Be A Bat?"" from Thomas Nagel. It's the definition used by Annaka Harris in her best selling book ""Conscious.""

If you don't like my definition, please feel free to offer an alternative one. I'd prefer to avoid confusion over whether we're discussion higher brain function vs fundamental experience of being. For example, in pop culture to be ""unconscious"" simply means to be asleep or not awake. That isn't the consciousness I'm talking about and would not be interested in debating that.

> Why can't non-experience generate experience?

Let's frame the question this way. At what point should a computer with advanced intelligence become self-aware? What particular set of code, or configuration of its circuits, will lead to self-awareness? The point I am trying to make is that if we think of the brain as similar to a computer, just a set of hardware with electrical signals, there is no reason to believe that consciousness should spontaneously emerge from unconscious matter. Regardless of how you program it. Yes, we have senses, but why are those senses being observed by consciousness? If I attach a sensor to a computer, would you assume the computer is now self-aware just because it has a sensor and data input from the external world? I hope that clarifies a bit.

> And why is experience necessary for material things to exist (I find this to be an extremely daring thesis)?

This is more my own personal thesis. I appreciate you calling it daring, that was kind and careful of you. We don't have to focus on this, but the simplest way I can explain it is asking a question. If the universe is essentially information, and information exists only as states of a medium (i.e. pen on a paper, recorded states of an atom through an instrument, etc.) then what is the medium that information is universally written on? It's like a hard drive in a computer. If you save a file, it has to go somewhere in order to exist. In a computer it goes on the hard drive. What is the universal hard drive? Where is all this information being objectively stored so that it actually exists? To me the only answer is consciousness, because even information itself isn't self-generating. Information is generated by interacting with other information, but if the information isn't stored anywhere to begin with, how can it ever interact and manifest? It's very abstract, I know. I'm fine if you don't want to delve into that aspect of it."

1. Panpsychism is currently one of the most widely accepted and hotly debated alternatives to the emergence theory in philosophy and neuroscience. A recent example is Sam Harris' wife Annaka Harris who just published a best selling book called ""Conscious"" where she proclaims panpsychism to be the best theory available. She is a consultant to scientific authors including her husband Sam, a neuroscientist. In it she quotes multiple well respected scientists and philosophers who all consider panpsychism to be the leadeing theory, and emergence theory (that the brain generates consciousness) to be unscientific.
2. The definition used for consciousness is basically a reference to the essay ""What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"" by famous philosophical author Thomas Nagel. It's not my definition, I simply agree with it, so go ahead and insult Nagel, not me.
3. My argument against emergency theory, or he theory that the brain generates consciousness, is a common one used by popular proponents of panpsychism who are well respected within the philosophical and scientific communities. It was basically a summary of the hard problem of consciousness, which is one of the most seriously considered topics in neurology and philosophy to date.

You basically came out and focused on a straw man of what I said, claiming I just abused some self-created definition and didn't answer anything. You were wrong on all accounts and are a total waste of my time. You even got the basic understanding of panpsychism wrong, which you wouldn't have if you took 5 seconds to google it and read the wikipedia."
entp,fm9dc5w,t1_fm91l5c,1585866426.0,Maybe you should Google panpsychism before you try to come across as a genius. You made a fool of yourself.
entp,fm8x1o8,t1_fm8uyhw,1585857615.0,"First, let's define consciousness as the ability to experience being. Second, it is unreasonable to assume that the ability to experience can ever arise from anything else, let alone something material. Experience must be fundamental to the universe. Without experience as the foundation, non-experience could never evolve into experience because no configuration of non-experience would ever generate experience. Experience is the necessary element for material things to exist."
AskAChristian,fm8ucmu,t1_fm8tfem,1585856183.0,"> Not according to Christianity.

Cite the exact text that disagrees with my statement. Simply saying ""Not according to Christianity"" means literally nothing and is a useless contribution."
AskAChristian,fm8t5gx,t1_fm8p7mq,1585855542.0,">What do you mean “blamed”? You can’t blame a judge if he rightly gives you a prison sentence for breaking the law. How could you blame God for something?

God created man with imperfect judgment, else man would not be capable of sin. God may be self-proclaimed perfect, but we, as imperfect beings, are incapable of recognizing perfection. As a result, it makes sense that we would blame god for our horrible lives because by our standards we can not know what is and isn't right judgement, we only know what is and isn't pleasurable and painful. That is how god made us, to be resentful."
AskAChristian,fm8ongs,t1_fm8muc9,1585853179.0,"By that logic, God is responsible for both the good and the bad in your life, so can he also be blamed for your misery?"

entp,fm88wik,t1_fm7vxkg,1585844987.0,">Btw your search is kind of shit ngl. INFJs best partner would be the ENFP, followed by INFP, followed by ESTJ. Also INFJs are never submissive, they hate losing control over their life and future. 

Uhh...

Every Google result spoke about ENTP. Also I am a submissive INFJ type 2 enneagram. Weird assumptions."
mbti,fm88qkm,t1_fm7gjmt,1585844901.0,How does that translate romantically if I may ask? Do you know your enneagram by chance?
entp,fm69xzz,t1_fm68cay,1585789429.0,"Thank you. I have found the ENTP conversation to be a thing of beauty so far. People answer questions in here unlike anywhere else, with depth but also precision and clarity. I'm thinking of delving into other topics with you all :)"

Would you say that you like to be the leader, or as you put it, only when you're selected based on your qualifications? Do you desire the role for own enjoyment, or only when it makes sense?"
mbti,fm5qfn1,t1_fm5n0md,1585777911.0,Thank you for your input. Which MBTI are you?
mbti,fm5qdy4,t1_fm5k4qz,1585777885.0,Thank you for your in depth assessment! I'm just starting to learn about enneagram. I've been working with MBTI for years. What are the major differences and do you have any advice on how I should use one vs the other?
entp,fm59nwn,t1_fm54kj5,1585768892.0,Thank you for the blunt and honest assessment. Not everyone needs to be helped with passive listening and emotional venting. Sometimes people want help by logically understanding their thoughts and the world around them. Talking through things in a rational way analytically. Is that something entp night be good at and enjoy? Or does it still feel sticky?
yandere,flxpgq5,t1_flwu78y,1585587346.0,Thanks I will

DreamInterpretation,flr81h8,t3_fqnp8i,1585414872.0,"The field trip for school represents you being in sync with society. Your attempt to be witty is an expression of your desire to fit in. The hamster talking reflects the fact that the world around you has become uncertain and strange. Repeating what you said like a parrot also points to the relationship you have with your friends. You walking down the path on your own is your separation from society and thinking for yourself. The woman with no face is someone without a social identity or status. The eye in her hand she warns you about represents vision and intelligence, which you will develop if you continue moving down your own path away from society. The fact that her hand was wrapped and bandaged, and she was warning not encouraging you, is an expression of your own fear that you would regret this choice."
