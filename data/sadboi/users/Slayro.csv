relationship_advice,fnw4ffy,t1_fnupy7f,1587311223.0,"This guy is right, OP. If she was capable of something like this, at this point in your relationship, think about how bad it could get down the line. What will she smash up next? Your car? Your computer? Your dog/other pet? Your loved one's ashes? You? Your children? She's already hurt living things to upset you. Going unchecked, this behavior WILL escalate - It's  not *if*, it's just *when*. This is a clear sign of mental imbalance. She has both anger and impulse control issues. These things need to be addressed - ASAP, because she's now proven just how dangerous she is. As the user above mentioned, she even left you to clean up the mess BY YOUR SELF. Her behavior is cold, and depicts clear premeditation.

If it were me in this situation, I'd cut my losses. Something that a therapist once told me, is that many abusive partners begin to show their true colors around the two year mark. This has been true for me. Once again: She has proven herself to be dangerous. Don't let yourself end up being the one who feels bad. She needs help, and she has to do that on her own before she considers a relationship, in my humble opinion.

She likes feeling in control. She's breaking down your confidence so she can wrap you around her finger... and it seems to be working. You call her ""sweet girl"" and your ""dream girl"" in these texts. Why? Do you think this is the best that you can get?

I will tell you, though - I've been prescribed both. I'm on 900mg 3x daily gaba, and, the side effects kinda suck, so, I asked to make the switch. I tried it for a month and switched back to gaba.

You say multiple times in you're post that they're nice people. Nice people don't treat others this way upon meeting them for the first time. And, they most definitely don't post rude comments on a social media post that doesn't even concern them.

I'll say this again - YOUR FIANCE NEEDS TO CONFRONT THEM ABOUT THIS. If he loves you and respects you, then, he should.

Edit to add this: If my partner valued the friendship of people who were treating me badly, over fixing the issue or cutting them off, then I'd walk, personally."
