I'd say the best advice I can give to get out of a slump is to take a break. I know the pressure is on with covid-19, but you can't continue to flex a tired muscle. Watch a good movie, eat something new, go for a BUNCH of walks if that's an option for you in your state, but just stop thinking about it for awhile, then learn to say ""fuck the past, I'm going to move on. I'm not going to let past failure stop me.""

It's a creative outlet and will be looked back on as someone who stood up to bullies. Real bullies, like people that hurt people because they look different or act differently. You know, kind of like the horrible people that walk around daily in this world. So shove that self-righteous attitude right back where it came from. No one's a saint and no one's a sinner.
