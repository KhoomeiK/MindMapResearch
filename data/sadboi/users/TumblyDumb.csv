I've had a few off handed comments from people, who spoke about the way he died,  and it really struck me horribly. I'm sorry for your loss and that someone so terrible is bringing it up in sick ways to you. Have you tried to ignore him? I do that with most people as you we aren't always in a situation to be able to do anything. Maybe ignoring him would be best as it makes it so hes not getting his ego fed?"

Vent,f3iv0j9,t3_dh06z3,1570942685.0,People are quick to point out others past flaws nowadays and it's bad. We can't expect anyone to move on if we use someones past against them like that. You are trying to be a better person and I personally think that's really great! The fact that you openly admit to have been a mean person is a step in the right direction. I am proud of you. Keep at it.

What you say I agree with, and it isn't Americas fault that other countries aren't helping their own people. I worry about the children mostly. There will be some messed up adults later on and I'm not sure what will come from that."
worldpolitics,ewotwut,t1_ewojf1r,1565626585.0,"The detention centers may not be as awful as Nazi Germany, but immoral things are happening to people there everyday. Do you think we are so innocent in what happens to those people? And how else are families, who come here for a better life, supposed to get across with their kids? Obviously they don't all have cars or big buses looking to bring them. 
While I understand making sure that the kids are with the right people, how are actual families supposed to know that they need all of this documentation to prove they are parents? Many of these immigrants leave everything behind because of many factors. Like you said, nothing is just black and white.
I'm not saying we should just let people walk in. Many things in this country need to change."

MomForAMinute,es3d9w4,t3_c5mv2b,1561559857.0,"I've had about 17 surgeries and I always tell people that the worst part for me is getting the IV in. That being said, it actually isn't too bad and most places have great nurses who will tell you exactly what they are doing. Drawing blood is much easier and doesnt hurt like a shot. 
My doctors also know of my anxiety when it comes to needles and give me a little pill to help me relax. (Possibly Valium(?) Maybe you could talk with a doctor first and see if you could possibly get this before you get your wisdom teeth taken out? 
I also lay down with any shots or blood draws as it helps me feel more grounded. Also if I feel sick then I won't suddenly fall over. I completely understand how you feel, but you dont want to/ shouldnt have  to live like this forever. Maybe see a therapist as well for your anxieties? It may help and they may have suggestions for you."

Medicaid won't accept me as they combine the entire household earnings (?) Which is ridiculous as my mother doesn't make a lot either and my brother doesnt contribute to the house. 
I also feel a mass and pain in my right breast and I already know I cant afford to go to my doctor just to be told that I need a specialist to take a look. And I want to start schooling so I can actually afford to live, but the costs terrify me. I can't even finish having surgeries for a birth defect as I have no freaking insurance or anyway of finding help to get them finished and that also is a blow to my self esteem. Everything costs so much and its anxiety inducing just to think about."
