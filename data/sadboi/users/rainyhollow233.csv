relationship_advice,fq7r0e5,t1_fq63aig,1589150443.0,I don’t... know...
relationship_advice,fq30ti6,t1_fq2pa1c,1589061962.0,"How do you suggest I tell him? He’s asked me multiple times ‘have you told me everything’ and I’ve responded ‘yes’. This is really going to hurt him a LOT and I definitely don’t think there will be chance for a friendship, maybe in a very long time but I doubt even then. The only reason a friendship is forming now I feel may be due to leftover feelings."
relationship_advice,fq2uwo4,t1_fq2ps4t,1589060000.0,That is a very good point
relationship_advice,fq2pfha,t1_fq2ov9f,1589058359.0,"Well I’m trying to encourage him to continue his current relationship, I don’t think I worded this post right. I even suggested he delete me. I really think it would cause less damage to ghost him then to tell him this lie. It’s quite shocking."
BPD,fq0sg45,t1_fq0k6v9,1589037023.0,Woah I see myself in this post and I do not like it
NPD,fptl2tx,t3_gfabnn,1588893265.0,"Here’s my opinion; you think differently than them. Doesn’t make you smarter nor does it make them dumber. Your friends who are not disordered don’t value you for what you do for them, but rather the friendship you formed at some point. They give to you because that’s what friends do, and they may/may not expect anything in return. How would you feel if these friends stopped giving their time to you? It’s up to you how you live your life but using your “friends” for what they offer you (self esteem boost? Favours? Idk) sounds lonely. 

So to answer your question, no I don’t think your friends are stupid. They may not value themselves that highly if they let you walk all over them but it also sounds like they care about you to a degree. I think you’ll miss that when it’s gone."
BorderlinePDisorder,fprpp47,t3_gf3qbl,1588859580.0,Yes also INFP here that’s so interesting
BorderlinePDisorder,fpq13wh,t1_fppzqpd,1588813075.0,That’s alright x
BorderlinePDisorder,fppy9ix,t3_gerbbn,1588811487.0,"Alright alright I’ve been there, too. It’s the low low moments that make you want to just disappear, I know. But listen here, why say such mean things to yourself? What makes you so different that your life isn’t as important as everyone else’s? Not everyone is going to be an incredibly successful millionaire, there’s too many of us for that to be realistic. But what is true is that you are as important and significant as every other living being on this planet. Tell yourself that every day. And stop beating yourself up. Would you tell the things you tell yourself to your own daughter or son? No? Well that’s what you are doing. Inside all of us is just a child and once we are adults it’s our responsibility to treat it right. I can’t guarantee life will always be easy, but you’re already here and our days are limited as it is. Take the time to forgive, love and nurture yourself and your environment. Life is far from fantasy but it’s not that bad and it’s all we have. So trust me when I tell you that you are capable of more you just gotta be kind to yourself and work with what you’ve got. I’m not going to pretend I’ve got it all worked out either and sometimes I need to listen to my own advice more but I’m getting there, and I hope this resonated with you."
NPD,fpncju4,t1_fpnc28x,1588758087.0,"Yeah I’m female and as a kid I had a closer friendship to my dad but my mum was always there for everything and shes always had anxiety and been a stressed person, and her family is this way too, she can be a bit conservative so we were never comfortable talking about personal stuff. But she loves me very much and I can see that. 

Generally I can’t find any major red flags as to being mistreated by my parents in any way. I know I was always super desperate for their attention and felt inferior to everyone but I don’t know why. Also apparently my “terrible twos” lasted for 3 years if that means anything. From what I’ve heard though I was an easy baby and didn’t cry too much. So idk what all of this means or if it has any significance. I don’t have any brothers just me and my sister.

Thank you for the book recommendation I will check it out."
BPD,fpiivwd,t3_gdldqz,1588641834.0,I’m very much the same but I think for me it’s social anxiety because I don’t know what to say or how to act
BPD,fpiiq00,t3_gdcduu,1588641736.0,Yes. Yes. Yes. I’ll bulk buy 50 sheet masks on Amazon and a bunch of clothes to “start fresh”. I used to go and buy a whole block of chocolate when I felt the tiniest bit empty or upset. Better with this now but I’d say still once a fortnight I still go and buy a binge kind of food but I’m not sure if that’s a normal amount or not
NPD,fpii1ng,t3_gdn0sy,1588641334.0,"I think lots of people have the same thoughts and I do too but I always try to correct them and restate to myself why it is wrong to think that like I’m a child 🙃 but really we are just adult children who are still learning, that’s what I notice about npd and other personality disorders. I relate to a lot of what you said and, I struggle most with other females (I’m a female). I’m getting better with this once I became self aware but since I’m so jealous and intimidated by other females it’s hard to make friends and I degrade them in my head just to make myself feel better. Def not good and that’s my first task at hand to get over"
NPD,fpbxsaj,t3_gcjg58,1588481550.0,"This may/may not be as helpful for you as it is for me but I try to imagine how that person would react if they heard that, and how I would feel if I were that person.
Also, people don’t care if you’re a good guy as much as you care, it’s good to remind yourself that. We’re all pretty flawed and it only helps you make better and truer connections with people if you’re honest and vulnerable about those flaws. Most people aren’t looking for someone perfect, we all just want to feel safe and loved.
If you’re religious like me I also find it helpful to remind myself that God will be the judge, but obviously that’s not relatable for everyone. 
Also there’s no such thing as a good or bad person :) don’t get too caught up on that idea"
BreakUps,fp49ckf,t1_fp2wo5j,1588294297.0,Besides that I hope you’re coping alright and thank you for giving me hope (that I might find someone else)
BreakUps,fp474vs,t1_fp2wo5j,1588293021.0,"He’s 22 and he’s very committed to relationships so I highly doubt they’d break up any time soon if they did, so there’s definitely no chance in the near future at least. Even if he did come back I don’t think it would be for years but I don’t want to hold onto a false hope because that will mess with my head. You make a good point and on a realistic level I’m sure I will find someone again. Just looking at all the guys around me none of them compare to him and that’s really painful"
BPD,fosnp8q,t1_fosk5vl,1588034331.0,Or MAYBE it’s that our brains don’t process a healthy reciprocation as love so we reject it
BPD,fosn1td,t1_fosk929,1588033958.0,Omg no don’t let me get in your head ahah you may be different to me
BPD,fosjze2,t1_fosjsfi,1588032203.0,Like looking down on someone when they like me more than I like them (for once in my life)? I realised I was doing this and tried to stop but I just did not feel into them at all
BPD,fosjhvy,t1_fosjaph,1588031927.0,Yep can relate to that one 🤦🏼‍♀️ do you think it’s narcissistic?
BorderlinePDisorder,foojfb5,t3_g8grw7,1587940154.0,"I’m not diagnosed yet but I’m almost certain, and last year/a few months ago I slowly started to kind of figure out what’s wrong with me and make some changes before I found a name for it. Not nearly there yet though and I’m zooming my psych tomorrow :P"
BorderlinePDisorder,folacng,t3_g7zopo,1587858049.0,"Minecraft because it’s kind of therapy and never gets old, also I think there’s been an intruder on the camp. Cat to the right has rushed in to tell the leader (tortoiseshell on the right), the black cat is concerned and cat to the left is looking to see the intruder"
NPD,fod5k9w,t1_foaq4bq,1587680249.0,Yes I love Dr. Ramani’s videos. I don’t think she offers a guide for people who are narcissists themselves though
NPD,fod5a24,t1_foaq4bq,1587680102.0,Well after breaking up with my boyfriend I’d resorted to convincing myself that he was also a bad person as a coping mechanism so I didn’t have to deal with the guilt of how much pain he’s in. I developed real bad sleeping issues and I had to come to terms with what I put him through and that his pain as a human was very very real. Then that allowed me to reflect upon my behaviour with honesty and it’s been reaaaaaaal painful to do that. I really want and need to get better
BorderlinePDisorder,fo8crpr,t1_fo7ce2y,1587594091.0,"Thank you for your kindness, it’s not easy to open up about this stuff without hearing “well yea u should feel bad go die”.
How long has it taken you to get to the place you are now if I may ask?
I try not to self diagnose but it’s gotten a little hard to avoid the obvious signs. I have a psychologist that I started seeing a few months ago but we’ve just talked about anxiety and schemas so far. I want to book another appt and talk to her about this. I’m not sure if I should bring up that I think I may be bpd or tell her everything in this post and let her guide any diagnoses and therapy? 
Thank you again"
