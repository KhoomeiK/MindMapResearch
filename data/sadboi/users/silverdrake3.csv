It would be very difficult to keep track of which animals have lived how long in a herd/flock unless you gave them individual ID tags (which I understand most farmers do anyway) and track down individual animals when they get old enough. That's a lot of manpower for an insubstantial profit.

It seems more likely farmers would get a whole bunch of calves/chicks/piglets/whatever who were born at roughly the same time, raise them together, and slaughter them all the same time.

I think my toxic shame came from two sources. First, my dad was abused himself, and had an incredibly hard time talking to people he didn't know. He would regularly downplay his accomplishments (Me: ""Wow, you rebuilt that car's engine! That's awesome!"" Him: ""It's alright I guess."") and belittle himself (Him: ""I'm an asshole and I know it.""). I think that taught me it's ""normal"" to hate yourself.

Second, I didn't attend elementary school until relatively late (I was home schooled until I asked to switch). Unfortunately I had been working more on literary skills and my math knowledge was actually more focused on things like fractions rather than the times tables. As a result, I was held back to 4th grade (even though I was reading at a much higher grade level, 8th I think). As a result I thought I wasn't ""as smart as I think I am"" and have had a terrible relationship with math in general (not good when you're trying to be an adult). I thought that if I got A's in everything, they would let me skip a grade and I could get back to ""normal"". It never happened, and that was just proof of my failure. High school was much worse, because then I was failing at socializing.

So, yeah. Secondary trauma definitely lines you up for future trauma. I'm trying to learn to take up space again and forgive myself. Math and especially money/debt still trigger me, but luckily my husband is willing to take the lead on that. Someday, I hope to be able to balance a checkbook without panicking."

Sometimes doctors get it wrong. Sometimes a dentist will look at you and say that clearly you have a broken tooth (to follow your metaphor) or gingivitis or you need a root canal.

But then you get treatment and it doesn't seem to do much, the pain is still there and it doesn't go away. So when you get home you do research, and you notice that the symptoms for the disease the doctor says you have don't line up with your experience. You might even find another disorder that lines up more closely.

So for all that is good for you, **raise some hell!**

It was only after some DBT therapy that I truly realized that I can take up space in my life, and that if I think something isn't right I should speak up. I was frustrated that my life kept spiraling out of control even with heavy medication, and doctors kept insisting I was Bipolar. But my depression wasn't just depression. It was fear, anxiety, and self-hate among other things. My previous doctor called these ""mixed episodes"". They were literally the only episodes I was having, not the 'ups and downs' everyone else refers to.

So I raised hell. I told my doctors I was tired of feeling belittled and treated like a child in my own care. I sent them links to scientific papers. There was a controversial course of treatment for one of my other conditions (hypothyroidism), that I thought would alleviate the worst of my symptoms.

It took me correcting my own damn endocrinologist (TSH does NOT go up when you increase meds, it goes down!) and many lengthy email exchanges before he agreed we could try the treatment as a trial.

And you know what?! After a week and a half I am doing more with my life than I have in years. I take showers without my SO having to pester me. I walk the dog. I do the dishes. I'm writing again.

2. I prefer the human machine, honestly. We're pretty much a colony of cells all working together for a common goal, to survive. We even carry bacteria that don't show our DNA sequences. And that's pretty darn cool.

1. Body scanning

Sit/lie in a comfy place. Close your eyes and feel your body. Look for a spot that feels different somehow, warm or tingly or cool. Imagine you have a paint brush and start spreading that feeling around. Try to get every square inch of skin. I like to fall asleep like this.

2. Internal conference room

This one is a bit more advanced, and I recommend you discuss it with a therapist beforehand. Give yourself a day or two to prepare. Think of all the ''parts"" of your mind, like your anxiety, your conscience, or your maternal/paternal instinct. Give them faces. You're going to meet with them.

As before, get comfy. Close your eyes. Pick a number that's at least 50. I usually do 100. Imagine a staircase with that many steps. Walk down, imagining every step, the shifting of your body, your hand on the rail, the pull of gravity. Count the steps as you go. At the bottom, you'll see a door. Inside, you'll find all those parts around a conference table.

It may get scary. Things might get heated. Remember, all these characters want what's best for you, even if they have different ideas about it. You're their leader. Explain what you expect from them, and why what they're doing can be harmful. You're in control.

When you're done, go back up the stairs the same way, counting steps. I did this a couple days ago and I can honestly feel a difference.

ptsd,fiqom6r,t1_fiqd91b,1582648727.0,"I had a very similar experience. Several years and several therapists who would encourage me to talk about what makes me hurt, but nothing really to address either the flashbacks or bouncing back from them. I just kept feeling more and more broken.

Current therapist is like, ""We talked a lot about your trauma. Make sure you do something nice for yourself today. Take care of yourself."""

Is it 'cuz of most custody battles going in favor of the mother? Wait, that would mean that in the context the mom's the abusive one.

I'm pretty sure one of us is confused."
Equality,fi72gkd,t1_fi6cuoq,1582212886.0,"THIS! Forcing a child to spend more time with a parent they don't like (i.e. if the parent is abusive/emotionally unavailable) can cause a lot of damage. Their lives are most impacted by the decision, why not let them make it?!

I know kids are noobs, but at least treat them like they know what they want!

Sorry, child's rights are my big button issue..."

Dudeism,fgm9tc1,t3_ez86oo,1580920578.0,"I'm kind of working on the same thing. I've been a Donny for way too long (occasionally with frantic self-hating episodes that don't really have a character I can reference) so stress levels tend to be high.

I try to set myself up so I'm surrounding myself with things that make me happy and content, and discarding things that don't whenever possible. This is much like the Dude's sparse apartment-- he's got his rug, Caucasian ingredients, and is otherwise fairly minimalist.

I also do things, again, that make me content and happy. Enjoying the company of my dog, for example. Tea is definitely a favorite of mine, especially when combined with video games or a good video. I like [nature](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCONd1SNf3_QqjzjCVsURNuA) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Nj4gkoi_n5eCcrKCVOXKA), [letsplays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCioOMe7NDn9ko2H0hiKLHeQ), and I've recently gotten into [bonsai](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxWc7cn-M-22gie8oPslLcA).
