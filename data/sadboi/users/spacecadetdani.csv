SantaClarita,fpp705c,t1_fpnt90c,1588797063.0,"US Constitutional rights are not unlimited individual power. Yours ends where mine begins and visa versa. A state of emergency locally, state, and federally has been declared and that means that the voluntarily measures need to be taken for the sake of public health. As much as you're worried about your life resuming back to normal, the government is suppose to care about the overall public health. That is their job.

Let's go over your freedumbs, shall we?

No one is stopping you from having a religion. Simply asked you to move it online during a crisis for the congregation's safety. Pray at home until its safe to resume activity as stated by experts and authorities.

No one is preventing your right to air grievances, but also, no one is required to listen to your bullshit either. And we get a say too. Imagine that. There are also exceptions to free speech. Those exceptions are: incitement, no false statements of fact, no obscenity, CP, inciting the breach of peace (fighting), threatening the President, speech owned by others, commercial speech, restrictions based on special capacity of government officials and branches.

You can peacefully assemble in small groups BUT people are straight up ignoring the voluntarily measures for public safety which is why we are where we are. While governments may not deny a person's constitutional right to peacefully protest, they may regulate the time, place, and manner in which the protest is conducted. Currently the local and state government are telling you not to do this because a very contagious disease is ravaging our nation and are asking to stand apart, wear masks, and respect orders.

No one took your pew pews.

No soldier occupied your home without consent.

You have not been unreasonably searched or seized.

This is not a criminal case to argue the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth amendments.

The ninth is a mystery to the laymen. This amendment is sometimes used to stop the government from expanding its powers beyond those listed in the Constitution. Its also been used to argue a right to privacy for abortions without spousal permission. But its not something you can cite to say that staying in 7 days a week is harming you.

And lastly, the powers not in the constitution are delegated to the state, who told you to STAY THE FUCK HOME and you can't even do that. Pathetic."

With some time to reflect and absorb some literature on my diagnosis, as well as guidebooks on shunning, I've found that resilience in self preservation is key. Why am I telling you this? I'm tired too but I know this can't be it. Quotes that have helped me during my process are: ""Because the only way out is through"" (Robert Frost)  and  ""There are far, far better things ahead than anything we leave behind."" (CS Lewis). You've got to get through the hardest time to get to the good stuff. Its just ahead.

We discussed sex as a healthy part of growing up and left condoms in all the bathrooms just in case (two teenagers). I told her that virginity has a lot of societal weight, but realistically it does change dating once it starts. Once you’ve become sexually active, it’s expected in a relationship escalation with whomever you date going forward. That is why she should wait until absolutely ready. And she did wait. They both did. I don’t know exactly when it happened but I know it happened at our house and that she was being safe about it. She’s in college now, on birth control, with a steady LDR boyfriend.
