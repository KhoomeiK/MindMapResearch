migraine,fp49tw8,t3_gb7y6w,1588294569.0,I have fibromyalgia and get chronic migraines. I started seeing a musculoskelital(so) doctor. He is similar to a chiropractor but he also manipulates the muscles and it made all the difference. It turned out I was so out of place all over that it was causing a ton of strain on my muscles and in turn causing my migraines.
Fibromyalgia,fp1kqpl,t3_gas5um,1588238884.0,If you feel that you have been misdiagnosed I would get a second opinion.

It's less common in children but children to get it. Fibromyalgia isn't always easy to diagnose.
Gastroparesis,fonq3yz,t1_fonp4dw,1587924272.0,The calzone had a ranch sauce but I do get acid reflux bad from red sauce. I have had this calzone before with no issues but that could have changed. I do plan on keeping a food diary along with any symptoms I get so I can figure out what I need to avoid. I don't tend to have issues with dairy if they are low in sugar. I love ice cream but can't have it because I get really sick after. I was just talking to my husband about getting a ninja so I can make smoothies to see if that helps. I tend to eat more carbs then I should and I really want to get better nutrition. As it stands I only eat 2 meals that are pretty small because I can't eat much without stomach pain. Unfortunately since I am over weight my last gastroenterologist told me I must not be having issues eating since I'm so over weight and dismissed my worry about malnutrition. So I'm working on compiling enough information to take to a new Gastroenterologist when I'm able to get to one.

Gastroparesis,fon8xq5,t1_fomznjw,1587914766.0,"Thank you so much for your reply. I have only thrown up from GP 2x. I feel a bit better today and was able to eat some eggs and drink a bit of water. Unfortunately I got bad reflux and had some regurgitation and had to stay on my couch so I could be propped up all night. Unfortunately I am still learning what my trigger foods are and how much I can handle eating. It definitely feels more like a pressure and after the regurgitation episode, I feel like you may be right and I just over ate without realizing it. We had calzones the night before and I usually can handle them but I did eat more than I normally can. Along with still learning my triggers I am also still learning to stop while I am ahead and how much my body can really handle. I appreciate your help. It's nice to know I'm not alone in this even though I hate that at the same time."

I did find out that 20% of us with TOF end up with their right ventricle hardening instead of the typical getting larger and ""floppy"". I fall into the 20% and because of this I have to be on a water pill for life to prevent fluid from building up around my hear and lungs. Honestly from stories I have heard I feel truly bless that it hasn't been worse. I only had to have the initial open heart surgery and the rest have been heart catheterizations.

Gastroparesis,fjyqzx8,t3_ffdjj8,1583702712.0,It depends on how they do it. Some places you lay on your back after eating some eggs or oatmeal with contrast in it (you don't taste the contrast). Then you either stay in the machine for the full 2 hours and they take a picture every 1/2 hour. For me I got to go sit in the waiting room in between images.

AskDocs,fhwrpv5,t3_f55flm,1581927010.0,NAD but I'm going to assume the reason you ask is because with psychiatric meds you have to wean off of them. You don't need to do that with vitamins. It is safe to stop them. Of course if for some reason you are proscribed vitamins by your doctor it's best to discuss stopping them. I want to add that in the future you need to tell your doctor's when you are taking anything including vitamins because they can effect how your medications work.
