Advice,f3nxcwe,t1_f2lz1ak,1571003563.0,"Just this Thursday, I was called in by one of my school's vice principals. She sat me down and asked me if I knew that, along the lines of, my friend was spreading rumours about Mr. Rhodes being a child molester. So basically, my friend's mom called the school and attempted to remove Mr. Rhodes from the school and destroy his career.
Maybe I shouldn't have, but I warned both of my friends about him because I knew they had him for a period, firstly though just trying to find some more information about him. One of my friends kept saying that he was also an engineer AND in Atlanta. 

I knew she was lying and I lost interest and faith in believing this was really him, it looked less and less like him everyday, until now when I'm told that it isn't him. That her mom was trying to ruin his life.

I specifically told them not to say anything, but one of them is really digging attention and I know she didn't say anything but she told her mom. I just gave a statement, said it wasn't that I was saying that THIS is him. I was wrong, but I said 98%. I wasn't sure. However, my other friend said that she basically ratted me out by mentioning that I told her this in the first place.

Case closed. (On Friday, he looked distracted and a bit miserable and I felt so sorry, but I knew this wasn't my fault. Partially for giving her the idea, but I never spoke of it to ANYONE after that."

LifeProTips,f3h7jrj,t3_dh06pj,1570920025.0,"Not for everyone, including me. The sincere and mental force that always pushes down that idea. However, I don't think fear and anxiety are relatively the same. I've heard you've had GAD (same here) but some of us just can't handle those things.

Personally, when I'm hit and riddled with anxiety, I shake and sweat and basically negative emotions, but it isn't as easy as you're making it seem.

My limbs don't move. Even when I count to 1 2 3 and say I'm gonna say something, never has that ever worked. It's never going to happen and after so many attempts I've accepted it. Counseling is something that can really help for a lot of us though.
It's just the mental force when your physical firce doesn't work won't allow you to just 'face it'. That's what we're trying to run away and never stop running from. To flee, like a bear is chasing me."
HomeworkHelp,f3gqkqy,t3_dgztyx,1570914077.0,"I can explain it here:
So basically what coordinate value means, 7th grader here, is supposedly your x and your y. (x,y) like this.
X represents a number (any number) that stays on the x axis, the horizontal line on the your coordinate plane (like two number lines, but in a cross), and y is on the y axis, on the vertical line up.

When negative, there are things called quadrants, basically the 4 sections you see on a coordinate plane. 
Quadrant 1: the top right corner, positive.

Quadrant 2: the top left corner, postive.

Quadrant 3: the bottom left corner, which is negative, just negative numbers.

Quadrant 4: the bottom right corner, also negative.
(Best to memerize this, if you will bud.)

The origin point is the middle of the coordinate plane, literally where zero is. Neither negative nor positive.
Now to attempt to answer the question: The coordinate value (x,y) is negative at ______ and _______ of the origin point.

Both Quadrant 3 and 4 are negative so maybe use.. One of them? The wording is throwing me off, sorry. Maybe the blanks are bigger on the homework.

It's definitely Quadrant 3 and 4. Since 'the bottom' seems a bit off to answer the second blank, try 'to the left' or 'the right' depending on which one you use, Quadrant 3 or 4.

The second question is the same, except Quadrant 1 and 2 are the positives. If choosing Quadrant 1, put to the right.

I'm not sure if this answers it, is there a word bank? Anything other than 2 sentences? I'm a bit lost but I hope this helped. Good luck"

Later, things had gotten even better or worse for me. I began to know her indirectly from my surroundings, heard about her, even some mean things. I think I fell for her then.

My crush is a godsend, a beauty, almost mystic. Her adorable laugh, rounded cheeks, that.. Shyness she gets when talking in front of people and how her voice gets low and how intelligent she is. I don't care how she looks, I care about her and who she is. She's something far out of this world. I don't know. 

Something about how she is with her friends, people she doesn't like and how much people upset her makes me so confused about myself. My crush is herself, something else and all and that's what makes her my crush. She is an amazing person, that's why."
Crushes,f1pzwpm,t3_daiaqh,1569690941.0,"Hm, I'm definitely in a similar situation, but my advice is to maybe do accidental things that would start a conversation. Maybe you dropped your pencil and go to pick it up, but look right at her with a look. A friendly one, inviting if she looks at you back. Or, you could maybe try to check for instances where your crush might join the conversation with her friends and you, but I get it, a lot of us are way too shy ;(

Try getting interested in the things she likes. You're friends with her friends so try to indirectly or directly know more about her, look for anything common or to bond over. 

You could also hang around her friends more, maybe always have a spare pencil if she ever loses one. Overall, keep calm and be a good person. That would help a ton, offer help to people or her. I'm not sure, those are all I could think of for now. 
One day, maybe you'll be able to shoot your shot and, you know, maybe have her be the one you want always, but for now work up on the courage and don't worry too much. 

I hope all goes well for you, have an incredible day dude :) Also, it's a great and important factor to respect her, you know, be ready for her opinion when you talk to her because crushes always have this sense of keeping us interested in what they have to say all the time.
