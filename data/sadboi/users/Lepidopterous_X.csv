I have always said that truly special comedic actors have more talent bone in their body than the best dramatic actors. Not necessarily skill, but specifically natural born, irreplaceable talent. 

A lot of good acting we see at the movies is from having a great director, on-the-cuff editor, and casting producers that find an actor that already largely fits the role. But the ability to command an audience, engage a room full of people, and create wholly original, fully fleshed characters with consistent quirks and expressions for every situation‚Äîno director can bring that out. The writing is critical, but it all ultimately rests on the talent of the performer. 

Regardless of what you think of them, all the ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù comedies‚Äî*Ace Ventura, Austin Powers, Zoolander, Anchorman, Legally Blonde, Walk Hard,* etc. These movies would be **nothing** without the lead actor.

*The Butterfly Effect* has a few plot holes in it and I believe has a rotten score on RT, but in general it‚Äôs an incredibly dark and provocative existential experience. It was my #1 favorite movie for a few years after it came out.

TrueFilm,f9th5en,t1_f9t1m8q,1575623969.0,"I think the narrative was just overly ambitious and complicated, and thus confusing to most of us expecting a nicely packaged simple theme to get behind. It started too many threads, but it‚Äôs ultimately about growing up. 

At the end of *Frozen,* Elsa & Anna are essentially orphaned and left with these strange powers and an entire kingdom to rule. At the start of *Frozen 2,* we see how life in Arendelle has normalized and things are a little too still and comfy in the Kingdom. But just as they are growing complacent with how ‚Äúsome things never change,‚Äù a faint echo reminds Elsa that there is so much they don‚Äôt know about her powers. 

Thus they reluctantly choose to grow up and venture ‚Äúinto the unknown‚Äù to discover the ‚Äútruth‚Äù about themselves. And on that journey as things become uncertain and we don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôre headed, we must keep moving forward into the walled-up mist of harbored ancestral guilt and do ‚Äúthe next right thing.‚Äù 

So naturally Anna overcomes the black depths of depression to break her grandfather‚Äôs dam to restore order to nature & sacrifice Arendelle in the process as colonialist reparation for the long-forsaken indigenous peoples and Elsa becomes a Northuldran ice goddess fifth element enchantress of water memories to freeze her sister‚Äôs tsunami and save the kingdom while atop Olaf‚Äôs newfound sibling the mythical ice horse Nokk, representing Elsa‚Äôs maturation and coming-of-age since tamed during her near-drowning experience.

This brings me back to my own feelings I had to expel on canvas. I did a little **[write-up](https://boxd.it/KVCND)** of *Midsommar* after watching the movie last summer and it blew up on IMDb. It is more of a reflection than a dissection, but it probably complements your thoughts on the film well so I will just share it here!

> *I have always felt held. By a family... a real family. Do you feel held?*

One of the most universal and innately human desires is a sense of belonging. The human brain is not meant to be alone; we are evolved to be a part of something. Belonging fundamentally allows us to form our own sense of identity, establish social connections through community, and provides us with love, attention, security, and purpose. Perhaps more importantly, a lack of belonging is when we begin to lose sense of ourselves and who we are. This loss of touch with who we are when the world around us suddenly disappears... this slight loss of footing, dip in reality, always feeling somewhat displaced and perpetually unsettled... this encapsulates the mood of Ari Aster's [*Midsommar.*](https://boxd.it/KVCND) 

Aster has delivered a psychedelic genre-defying horror fable that wins its audience by creeping into our darkest corners of angst, longing, and loneliness. At its core, the film is about a young woman who copes with crippling anxiety rooted in a desperate and fearful need for love as she comes to terms with the end of a relationship. It's about anxiety, fear of abandonment, and moving on. It is a meditation on human belonging; an operatic catharsis played on the strings of emotional dependency; a journey both inward and outward, to finally let go of something that was never meant to be.

*Midsommar* is not a mystery or suspense movie. It unveils itself unapologetically, as if the filmmaker has no intention of hiding anything from us in the first place (the entire movie is visually depicted almost constantly in the background on walls or tapestries). Yet the film establishes its own rhythm and pacing. As the characters embark on a mushroom trip and grow weightless and spacey, so do we get entranced by the beautiful Swedish settings and sounds‚Äîat times indistinguishable from flutes being played by characters on-screen, and at other times, woven with a spell-binding aural hypnosis (listen to [‚ÄúAttestupan‚Äù](https://open.spotify.com/track/1j3ci3c2ZbHal1N4m0bCiT?si=-7b5vksrSpeJLOQTEA0hWg) without falling into a meditative trip).

Like *Hereditary* before it, the casting is exceptional. Florence Pugh portrays and embodies isolation and anxiety so effectively that the ideas feel nearly concrete. Her part as Dani demands an incredible range and her commitment to the role is apparent. Her character has an air of desperation to her. A perfect casting for a lonely soul. Jack Reynor, a critical piece to this opera as the unlikeable and detached boyfriend, also delivers in a solid performance that leaves us conflicted, or at the very least, challenged.

If Satan and Cannibal Corpse got together to shoot *Blue Valentine* in Sweden, I'd imagine it would be something like *Midsommar.* Aster taps into a dark and vulnerable place‚Äîhe opens the door to chests you may have locked away and have had no intention of coming back to. If you've gone through a break-up recently, it may resonate even stronger. It's uncomfortable, unpleasant, but ultimately, cathartic.

The director goes on to describe the film as almost a perverse wish-fulfillment fantasy. You see what you want to see. The inclusion of this overarching idea bears a universal relevance to how we can behave in the midst of the most toxic relationships. Entering the ethereal fog of H√•rga perhaps a metaphor for willfully indulging in our clouded judgment to escape our fears.

If [*Hereditary*](https://boxd.it/CcxBb) was a thematic exploration of inescapable fate, [*Midsommar*](https://boxd.it/NNQzV) is a tighter, more centered thematic reflection on emotional dependence. The thought given to the characters and script and the details within the various shots, symbols, and sounds will all surely leave many viewers coming back for more.

The screenplay is incredibly well written in its approach and Tom Hanks is absolutely perfect as [his sixth cousin.](https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/18/tom-hanks-related-mister-rogers/) 

Unfortunately by the second half of the film, the sweater unravels into formulaic melodrama so structured that you realize you already knew the beats of the film from the very first scene. It avoids going full Ron Howard and keeps a small-world feel, but it never really achieves legitimate poignancy outside of the one-on-one scenes with Hanks.

I found it to be disappointing overall, especially considering it‚Äôs in the race for Best Picture. It just becomes *very* by-the-numbers very quickly. It loses any originality it garnered with that beginning by rolling out the most predictable narrative.

Everything is neat and only really touched on the surface level. The only scenes that were strong were the intimate conversations with Mister Rogers, but they happen so few and far between. It‚Äôs fine that it follows a Scrooge rather than Mister Rogers (I actually found this to be quite ingenious), and formula can be forgivable if a movie has enough charm, but when neither the Scrooge (Lloyd Vogel) nor his family win over the viewer, it brings the movie down. *A Christmas Carol* lets you grow to actually care about Mr. Scrooge by the end. It really reflects on the life lessons he learns as he confronts them, and without spoon feeding or heavy handedness. 

In *A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,* it‚Äôs the same gist of the story but instead of visiting the Ghost of Christmas Past, Present, and Future to see Scrooge‚Äôs inner journey, it‚Äôs just two or three small scenes with Mister Rogers where Rogers says a few things and that‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs his journey. Lloyd has a ‚Äúlittle Timmy‚Äù moment with his child, but it‚Äôs so brief and we‚Äôre so estranged to the child by that point in the film that the growth is hardly felt. Even the article itself is written, wrapped up, & submitted so quickly, you can feel the beats of the film happening as beats of a film. It‚Äôs still worth watching with the right expectations, but the documentary was *so* much better. 

*A Beautiful Day* humanizes a saintly hero into an ordinary humble man to help us realize just how capable we all are of the simple kindness Mister Rogers exemplifies. A family film worth watching for the golden moments, the nifty score, and a tender performance from Tom Hanks. Go see it with a friend in need of inspiration and a cup of peppermint hot chocolate."

movies,f840j1c,t3_da8qul,1574226439.0,"What an epic and comprehensive post. I wish every movie had a thread like this. Just watched it this evening. Here are my [thoughts](https://boxd.it/SiOvF):

*The Irishman* is a film with its own breathing, beating conscience. Throughout the film, we are introduced to characters with the details of the gruesome fates that await each of them plastered on the screen. There is no mistaking many of these are dead men walking. Men with their fates sealed into the actions we are concurrently witnessing through the retrospective lens of an older, wiser person.

The movie is long, and it‚Äôs no *Wolf of Wall Street* in pacing, but it never gets slow or disengaging. It‚Äôs apparent that a lot of thought goes into instilling these moments with extra meaning or tension, from smelling something fishy to giving alcohol metaphors as someone who strictly doesn‚Äôt drink.

Acting is superb. Pacino is very Pacino, Pesci carries an intimidatingly loud silence, De Niro is great in every scene, and Anna Paquin gives a phenomenal ghostly presence. She may well have given the Oscar-nominated performance with the fewest lines in history (we‚Äôll see, Judi Dench...).

The de-aging effects have a *Polar Express*-y softness most noticeable in the early scenes. Makeup is only occasionally distracting (e.g. De Niro‚Äôs bright blue contacts). And there‚Äôs an early curb scene that should have been re-shot to be less old man.

*The Irishman (I Hear You Paint Houses)* is complete and wholesome cinema. It gives the Netflix generation a hangout sesh with some of cinema‚Äôs most beloved actors dishing out their same gangster core, but with the mental burden that haunts an aging hitman. The opening song contains everything Frank Sheeran is about to unfold for us over the next 3¬Ω hours. Over that time, the narrative weighs down the tune with a growing heaviness, all the way up until the poignant final shot. This is Scorsese in true form, doing what he does best, only with just a little more depth, wisdom, and humanity.

Has the quality and resonance of a ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω movie, but the various de-aging effects (while I respect the ambition, costs, & effort put into it) ultimately served as a notable distraction for me.

It may vary though, so you can always call the theater as the manager may be able to give more specific advice."
Cinema,f80hydx,t1_f80h7b3,1574129477.0,"I have already been listening to the *Girlhood* soundtrack a bit haha. Cheers, I hope you end up doing *Nightingale.* It makes for really interesting discussion for sure (as a lot of these well-done disturbing films do). *High Life* approaches sex and libido in a raw way, a little bit of a *Piano Teacher* vibe to it. 

And don‚Äôt mention it! I‚Äôll be checking you guys out. I love Haneke cinema and what you‚Äôre doing seems right in line with his perspective. Haneke and Aronofsky are my two favorites after Bergman. I like everything from them except *Happy End* and *Noah* respectively, though even those offer a few things to appreciate."

Side note: Despite my low score for *Nightingale,* it is my highest recommendation based on what you are looking for. My specific issues with the movie still remain, but my score has gone up since that time because of how provocative and well-written the film is. I think it‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre looking for, because it‚Äôs the kind of movie you can talk about for hours. It also just became available to stream on Hulu very recently!

The director Jennifer Kent also made *The Babadook (2014),* which has a lot of thematic symbolism and metaphor to discuss in it.

Also I just took a look at your list (nice list by the way!). I would say the first two films I mentioned would fit snugly within that list, as well as *High Life* by Claire Denis. The others are dark, but they‚Äôre not necessarily disturbing like *Funny Games.*"

TrueFilm,f7u4yyh,t1_f7tqyrn,1574010741.0,"Only time will tell as awards season unfolds, but at this point its biggest chances are for screenplay, and a legitimate contender for BP and Director. If I had it my way, it would be nominated for [Best Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/4vyLEx3a8nCHXSobvGXh2B?si=WiAScY9vSPm-qD_XEIRO5A) , Actress, Cinematography, and Costume as well, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs quite the Oscar darling to get so many noms.

*The Artist,* *Amour,* and *Roma* were all Directorial masterpieces, so I think Portrait‚Äôs BP nom will ultimately depend on C√©line Sciamma‚Äôs traction among her Academy colleagues. But on that note, Best Director chances may be slimmer if they get the impression I did, which is that it was a largely influenced, or at least not entirely original effort. I go into it a bit in [my review](https://boxd.it/RjIl3) here."
TrueFilm,f7qvvam,t3_dxhkqv,1573970465.0,"Very nice. I can see where you are going with most of your choices, particularly with *Parasite* (Palm d‚ÄôOr, and historic for Korean cinema), *Lighthouse* (a love letter to Bergman and the Greek Gods), *Endgame* (Bye RDJ), *Joker* fever taking over the DC fans, and Scorcese‚Äôs *Irishman* (consummate roles for a number of highly revered actors). I do think you are missing a few things that characterize 2019. 

‚Ä¢¬†January was the month of the dual Fyre Festival docs being released on Hulu and Netflix the same week. That was all the buzz when it came out (I personally prefer the one *not* produced by the Fyre team‚Äîthe Hulu doc, *Fyre Fraud).*

‚Ä¢¬†It is a year of horror sophomore debuts. Jordan Peele, Ari Aster, Robert Eggers, and Jennifer Kent all had highly anticipated and well-received second films. *Midsommar* has a massive following, with essentially Florence Pugh‚Äôs breakout role (who is now also getting awards season buzz for *Little Women,* and has been recognized for the relatively obscure *Lady Macbeth).* *Us* has lost steam since early spring but was ‚Äúthe‚Äù movie being talked about and topped everyone‚Äôs lists for pretty much a solid few months before *Endgame.* And Jennifer Kent‚Äôs *Nightingale* (follow-up to her 2014 debut *The Babadook)* breaks new ground in its handling of sexual violence through the female lens.

‚Ä¢¬†*Portrait of a Lady on Fire* is literally one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. The fact that France did not choose it as their Oscar entry for Best Foreign Film is exploding people‚Äôs minds. I can only assume it was a deliberate strategic choice after *Roma* lost votes in the Best Picture category last year for being a lock in the Best Foreign category (assuming *Portrait* will get the Best Picture nom). 

‚Ä¢¬†The most popular and prolific director of Spain essentially made his ‚Äú8 1/2‚Äù this year (Pain & Glory), and the starring role is a nearly unrecognizable Antonio Banderas and will likely land him his first Oscar nomination of his career. 

‚Ä¢¬†As much as some of us may hate to admit it, it is the year of the shitty Disney live remakes. *Dumbo* ‚û°Ô∏è *Aladdin* ‚û°Ô∏è *The Lion King* ‚û°Ô∏è then *Lady & the Tramp* just this week on Disney+.  It‚Äôs a nightmare and I hope it ends and soon. 

‚Ä¢¬†And lastly, speaking of Disney, *Frozen II.* And that is all that needs to be said about that one. :)"
