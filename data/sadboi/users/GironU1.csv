Some of these notes seam outdated. 

No more travel for many city people on the corporate level. So we are trying to ack voluntary like stage 4 to reduce hospital overloading. This being said, the poor still have to go to work while the richer works are all tempting in. Weath disparity right there.

Masks
Masks do work just the right kind. 
Currently using a pink two filter face respirator 3m. Not that cheap shit.
Last 6 month and total with right filter 60 bucks.

Gloves
Research lab grade. Currently triple gloving my hands if I am going to populated areas like airports and stores. So this would be similar to wuhun ppe process. But the big benefit is removal of top layers incase of area change.  

Eye wear 
Dont waer these much, but in many of the places I go, people are not acting like it is a deal what so ever. This means we are starting to see ass wholes who are actively getting people sick and coaching on others.
