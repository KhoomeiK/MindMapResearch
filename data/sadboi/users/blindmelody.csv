pokemongo,fqe2zon,t1_fqe1mef,1589300914.0,"fair point. i've literally never been able to set foot in masters before, since i've never had enough viable pokemon, and you would be surprised how much having a shitty phone limits your ability to get stardust. it's nigh impossible to raid or fight in a gym when your phone crashes or dies mid battle. i prefer great leage (my ultra team is still a WIP, although i'm maxing out my clefairy rn and very very very slowly working on getting giratina a second move). since i caught it in the wild with 3400+ CP i know that that's useful, although i think i was mixing up the attacker meta and the master league meta haha"

WritingPrompts,flsm4wk,t3_fqot9t,1585445298.0,"   INT Bar. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, in stark contrast to the biting cold outside. JANE is leaning against the bar, sipping a drink before she spots a STRANGER. They look familiar....

   She approaches them.

JANE: Hey.

   The STRANGER starts, and turns to face her. Their face is not especially remarkable, except in how distinctly and vaguely off it is. Something familiar she can't put her finger on; Something missing she can't quite place.

STRANGER: Hello...

JANE: Sorry for bugging you, but I can't shake the feeling that we've met before-

STRANGER: Definitely not. Nope. Never.

   They put their drink to their lips and turn away, and now JANE is very certain that she has.

JANE: Well... it's just, I never forget a face, so maybe-

STRANGER \[Dismissive\]: I've been told I have one of those faces, y'know?

JANE \[Skeptical\]: Right... but-

STRANGER: People are always like ""I've definitely seen your face,"" and y'know, they have seen your face, just like not on you, right? Happens all the time. It's a thing.

   They seem very proud of the excuse.

JANE: ....Okay. I'll uh. I'll leave you to it.

   She's finished her drink, and while her interest is piqued, if she doesn't remember, it can't be that important. She shrugs on her jacket on the way out, and braces herself for the cold. The STRANGER'S eyes follow her nervously.

\-----

   EXT an idyllic path in a forest. JANE is at her rifle, silently swearing her mark for going outside in this weather. She has very little to go on for this particular hit- no picture, just a description of what they'll be wearing, an exact time and place, and the assurance that there will be no witnesses from her own recon, so she's on high alert when-

JANE lines up the shot, as they turn, and-

JANE: ...What?

   Deja vu. She's seen that face before. She's seen that face in her cross-hairs before too. It's that STRANGER. They've stopped dead in their tracks and are staring down the barrel like they can see her. She doesn't move a muscle.

After 30 seconds- or years, take your pick- She hears a familiar voice shout out:

STRANGER: ...uh. You can- you can take the shot. Now. If you want.

JANE shoots up.

JANE \[Incredulously\]: *Excuse me?*

STRANGER \[Confused\]: Wh- I mean. I'm not gonna run, you'll just like- I mean you seem good at your job, so-

   JANE is understandably, pretty taken aback.

JANE: I- Well- You- You're not dead!

STRANGER: ...Are you- Are you letting me live? Is that what's-

JANE: No! No, I've killed you before!

STRANGER \[vamping\]: ...Noooo. No, like I said, I just- I just have one of those faces, so-

JANE: You fucking remember that? You remember *me?* And you're just- just fine with this?

STRANGER: Huh? Wait- no, no I-

   She takes a deep breath. Clumsily, she stumbles off the small cliff she'd perched herself on- she's pretty shaken up- and she strolls in front of them, takes a deep breath, and starts:

JANE: I have killed you before.

STRANGER: ...No this- this is definitely the first time I've been murdered-

JANE: No no no-

STRANGER: I mean- Generally, I'm no expert, but people only get murdered once right, so-

JANE \[Accusing\]: You've definitely got more than one.

STRANGER: I'm a... people. I promise.

   JANE looks wary.

STRANGER: ....

STRANGER: Okay. Okay, I'm not a people- person. Human. I'm not human.

   JANE looks warier.

STRANGER: Don't worry about it.

JANE\[deadpan\]: I'm already worrying about it.

STRANGER: Okay, well- \[he sighs.\] I'm Dion. You're Jane- well, today, right now, you're Jane.

JANE: How do you-

DION: Seriously, the questions are a lot. Okay? We will get there.

   She thinks about contesting that, but ultimately decides there's bigger fish to fry.

JANE: So.

DION: So... I'm kind of a minor god or something, and I can't really. Die. Per se.

JANE: A God?

DION \[Irritated\]: Little g. A god.

JANE: What's it matter?

DION: Wow, okay, you wouldn't like it if I called you Boba Fett would you? Different dude entirely. Rude.

JANE: Alright, alright. So, wait-

DION: No. So, I can't exactly die of old age. If you guys ever stop caring about me or my dominion en masse, I'd be able to die. So every now and then I just.... check in.

JANE: Okay... so what if we have stopped caring? You just get your brains blown out and that's that?

DION: Uh. Well. Before you people opted for more.... I dunno, sexy murders. Poison mostly. But yeah.

JANE: So you want to die?

DION: ....I never really though that far ahead. Honestly, it's kinda like uh... like giving myself an ego boost, yknow, like ""Hey, just making sure you guys still can't live without me.""

   JANE considers the entity before her.

JANE: Why have you kept hired me?

DION: Honestly? \[They rub the back of his neck\] The first time around, you were just starting out, and I was strapped for cash. \[They stop her from interrupting\] No I cannot just make more money. Not that kind of god. Anyway, you did such a good job! I mean, I've been murdered before, and boy, did you deliver. The service has always been great. So. For as long as you've been taking hits, I've been mostly getting your service.

JANE: So... are you saying my customer service is fit for a god?

DION: I mean, as far as gods go I have pretty low standards, but yknow, sure.

   JANE considers this.

JANE: Okay.

   She takes out a pistol and shoots them point blank in the chest. They start and look down.

DION: That was my favourite shirt! You never shoot there, fuck-

They are not bleeding. They are not in any form of agony, or shock, or pain. Just dismay.

Your argument boils down to ""they do what they want"" and that's a nonsensical way to run a game economy. If you think it's fine, then good for you, but I do not. And if people don't want to play, they don't have to, but if the goal is to keep people playing, then they should make decisions that keep people playing.

None of the things you're offering as explanations make any kind of sense, and you're hardly responding to any of the things I'm saying. You're speaking as though you've said something obvious. Maybe this is somehow much more out of my depth of understanding than I think it is, hell, maybe I'm suddenly having a stroke, but everything you've said seems nonsensical, and again, you seem so extremely unpleasant and dismissive.

Do you realise that the fact that you would need to be level 38 to play master league and there's effectively level caps for higher leagues due to how CP works is a good argument for why they should always be available?"

pokemongo,fhbhes1,t1_fhbexbn,1581442346.0,"First, obviously I'm rural, or else I'd already be raiding constantly. Secondly, this is a game, they're not making us do anything, and there's plenty of people outright refusing to play ultra on account of not having the option. Thirdly, I said this in a later response to someone else, but I'm not a fan of forcing intended play. Just because they'd prefer if we made use of all the leagues doesn't mean we should have to. If they so dearly want people not to stick to one league, then as opposed to forcing us into one course of action, why not incentivize it with different more lucrative rewards for other leagues. That's definitely more akin to the legendary example you gave. If they put legendaries in tier 1 raids as well, no one would actually do the tier 5 raids because there's no particular incentive to do so, ie, it's the only way to get legendaries. Meanwhile, if battling amounts to just grinding for dust and not actually having fun trying to rank up because I no longer have a reliable way to get rare candies and/or TMs to improve my team, I'll respond to that disincentive by just losing interest. It's boring to just jump in for stardust, especially when I don't have and can't get any star pieces. I know there are a lot of people who's interest is mostly strategic, but considering the massive casual userbase, I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that there's people other than me who find losing boring. Also, sure, you've got a bunch of pokemon made for great league, you said earlier you only ever play great league, but what about people like me, who are only just actually getting any kind of invested into PvP on account of never having the chance?
It doesn't make sense because its a disincentive for playing at all for people because it's not fun. Putting legendaries in high tier raids makes sense because it's an incentive to do high tier raids but doesn't discourage people from doing any raids whatsoever because there's still the reward of getting powerful pokemon, even if they're not legendaries, and yet, you can still do a raid and not be certain you'll lose. Not giving us a choice in this case doesn't make sense. If they really wanted to encourage stardust use, then having all 3 leagues and incentivizing each one differently makes more sense to me. Have different more lucrative rewards for the more expensive tiers so that people will want to pay out for them. If you could get more TMs and rare candies for ultra league then I'd definitely move on to ultra league eventually."
pokemongo,fhb83pu,t1_fhb7x38,1581436803.0,"It did work like that, briefly, but it turned out to be a bug. I will do that! Eventually."
pokemongo,fhb7s8h,t1_fhb73sw,1581436613.0,"It's a nice sentiment to encourage that, but it seems like forcing us into intended play personally. Like you wouldn't force someone who likes to sprint to train for cross country, and you wouldn't force a marathon runner to do relay. Is it really a problem if some players stick to one league? I'm sure in competitive pokemon there's some people who stick to OU and some who stick to UU, as well as some who like to dabble in all the different tiers, and that's not against the rules."
pokemongo,fhb7gy3,t1_fhb68nc,1581436428.0,"I have, I'm not, I'm not, they're not. The pokemon aren't missing from the teams, the teams themselves are just deleted."
pokemongo,fhb7bzu,t1_fhb632z,1581436345.0,"If they make money off of us walking, and you need to walk to unlock battle league anyway, why not just make it so people can play what they want? If people are gonna play whether they lose or not then what benefit is there in not having all 3 leagues open at a time? There's definitely folks who lose on purpose just for the dust, and they obviously will not care, but there's also people who genuinely enjoy PvP and would like to pick which PvP they do. I don't have an issue with spending dust, I have an issue with just outright not having the choice. I like Ultra and Great league, and I want to switch between Great league AND Ultra league. I kind of depend on winning for TMs and rare candy because raiding isn't viable, and those aren't things you can buy, and I can't find candy for the things on my team. My issue is with the removal of choice. I don't care about the stardust barrier that may or may not exist. I just do not like the fact that apparently, within a season, there's a limited frame of time in which I have access to something, for what seems to me an arbitrary and illogical reason."
pokemongo,fhb6297,t1_fhb4u4k,1581435575.0,"I know that (now) but I thought it'd just make more sense to have them all available, so you could pick whatever league you want to do at any given time. I like Ultra and Great League and want to do them both, whenever I'd like, in PvP, and it doesn't make sense to me that they'd be unavailable. There could be something I'm missing, likely there is, but I think them not being all available is weird."
pokemongo,fhb5r8g,t1_fhb4lux,1581435389.0,"I'd imagine that if people never played the ones they don't like, but all 3 are available, they'd get more money? Because then there'd be more people playing at a given point in time, whereas if people can't choose which league they fight, and just straight up don't the league that's available, it'd mean less profits. I don't really understand what you mean when you say that, can you maybe clarify it for me? I'm thinking about it from the perspective of someone like myself who wants to play both Ultra League and Great League intermittently, so perhaps that's why?"
pokemongo,fhazrkd,t3_f241vn,1581431415.0,"I wish the visit a new location thing applied to stops you haven't been to with *that* buddy. My island doesn't have that many stops, though we are (slowly) getting new ones. There's like no level 40 players though, so, it's slow, and I can probably never get that one."
computers,ffgjtoa,t1_ffgjcgb,1579907878.0,the idea of owning or buying a second laptop when i have one honestly seems so opulent to me... but youre right! i can always upgrade to a new one :)
computers,ffgj0zw,t1_ffgii3w,1579907355.0,"since it was a surprise gift that i got completely out of the blue, i wasnt able to give a spec sheet or anything. i dont really need a dedicated gpu except for maybe matlab, which i dont use offen currently, and havent really ever had any interest in upgrading laptops outside of memory and capacity. if i ever decided i did need the processing power i think id seriously look into building a desktop. i just happened to be given a laptop that has a pentium, and i worry about its ability to keep up with me. id feel really awful if i got a brand new laptop and it didnt last me very long."
computers,ffgi9k8,t1_ffghqcf,1579906847.0,"thanks! i'm just worried about running it into the ground. never had anything slower than an i5 i think, and i've found that trying to not have multiple windows open at the same time hasnt worked."
AnimalCrossing,felfibj,t1_felf7yp,1579220957.0,"Absolutely! I use a few databases but it's such an ordeal to look through them. I want to make it easier to parse, and I definitely intend to use as much data from New Horizon as I can."
firefox,fdjon70,t1_fdj04ou,1578481110.0,I'll look into that
firefox,fdirjzr,t1_fdiqqmz,1578449448.0,"I have the hard drive, although I have no idea what state that's in since leading up to its demise I was expecting a failure. I think it might still be functional (or at least, the data isn't gone) since I think the final blow was a power failure and not a hard drive one, although I can't remember what led me to that conclusion. No clue how I can get the data on it though."
firefox,fdilubw,t1_fdikukk,1578445787.0,Thanks for the response. That's really disappointing though.
pokemongo,fckyrag,t1_fckx9xu,1577736074.0,"I was going to say I don't know any lvl 40 players well enough to ask that, but I think in total I know exactly one level 40 from SLU and he's doing the best he can. We have at least one new stop, maybe up to 3, so there's at least some good. Next time I see him I'll ask, but I don't see him very often."

pokemongo,fck90a3,t1_fck72qc,1577719844.0,"I have! I haven't maxed my friends, but I already max my bag regularly. I'd like to upgrade it, but there's no nearby gyms and my phone does that dumb coin purchase glitch, so getting coins is also hard. Especially when people are so RUDE as to knock me out of the one instinct gym when there's a mystic gym AND a valor gym within walking distance and we never have any >:( instinct is very under represented here :/"
pokemongo,fck5wus,t1_fck5s90,1577717498.0,Thanks much! I'm doing my best to get to level 40. It's pretty slow atm.
pokemongo,fck3xry,t1_fck340d,1577715868.0,"Thanks for the advice! That last one is what I'm currently doing, people who are from SLU but no longer live here, or live in much more stop heavy islands and come here for work often have been helping out, and a few tourists join the discord I've started. I usually ask them to help nominate stops if they're at all able. Not sure how to go about reaching out to Ingress players, as far as I know it's a very small community here. 

As for the first two, I had no idea any of us had any power over those. Google maps has been very useless her up until the latter half of this decade, I'll look into it!

Also, happy Cake Day I suppose."
pokemongo,fck3ij8,t1_fck2zhr,1577715503.0,"I actually do see most of the stuff people submit here, and some of the worst ones are bus stops, though not very often. Since they're allowed in the rules, people submit them, but a bus stop here is very different from what I think Niantic has in mind.

Still, it be nice if there was some form of discretion. I understand the difficulty in lowering the cap, especially in figuring out how to do so for small towns/countries, but it's still a huge problem when the community access of a community based game is, due to an unfortunate compounding of factors, essentially behind a paywall."

Also she needs a name."
