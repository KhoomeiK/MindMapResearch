news,fkqmvfe,t1_fkqiuv2,1584450611.0,"On 3/12 I had a low grade fever after work and the following day my COVID-19 symptoms were in full force. I contacted my doctor and she advised me to self-quarantine and visit my local health dept for testing. I decided against going to health dept (OH) in fear of contacting if i didnt have it yet.  I let the weekend pass and symptoms worsened but I broke my fever. Doctor said that losing my fever meant I wasnt eligible for testing. However, my doctor ordered me on a 14-day quarantine b/c she cant say I dont have it. 
Call your Primary Doctor!"

Coronavirus,fkl3c4i,t1_fkkxu5y,1584297583.0,lol ptsd is really playin in my favor finally!
rapecounseling,fafolx7,t1_fafnzy4,1576028005.0,thank you. it feels good when someone can help bring me back to reality.
rapecounseling,fafnqwu,t1_faflzzj,1576027394.0,I really want to but I just fear the humiliation of it all.
CPTSD,f86h86i,t3_dz23sy,1574298136.0,Decided when I was 23 that I never wanted children. I’m 30 and still feel exactly the same now. I have nothing to pull realistic upbringing from outside of “television” and I just am so scared that all the fucked up things that feel stuck inside of me that make me feel “damaged”...can’t pass that down to anyone else. nah.
ptsd,f7wxi57,t3_dxqzqu,1574040724.0,Feel like I was sort of “conditioned” to like a certain type of sexual treatment because of some of my abuse. It’s hard to explain. But I definitely have seeked dangerous...re-victimizations. If that’s what’s we have to call it.
ptsd,f7bnphd,t3_dv2vch,1573573473.0,Right there with ya. There was zero “meaning” behind my trauma besides adults who were crap to me. I’m sick of hearing it and it makes me wanna scream.
ptsd,f723do5,t3_du5avu,1573352900.0,"This really resonates with me. Fuck. I’m so sorry for your pain and I really wish I knew how we could both throw this shit out but I haven’t figured it out, still. 13 fuckin years later and I am still drowning in him. he is the poison in my veins."
CPTSD,f2v8jlz,t3_de9yow,1570448295.0,"My big trauma happened from
13-19 for me and my high school years were extremely lonesome because of what was happening outside of school. I did not flourish. I did nothing. I just showed up to class, never spoke, never made a single friend in fear of everyone knowing my big-bad secret. I’m 30 now. I think about high school a lot and all the shit I missed out on because of the abuse I was suffering. 
Look. It hate saying this. But you, me, all of us here with C-PTSD..we are just different from most of the population. I hate that it’s the truth but it is. We are on our own careful timeline and even though it’s difficult..we can’t compare our timelines to those around us because they’re just not the same because of what we have gone through. Just know you are not alone in the way you feel."
CPTSD,f2v7wd5,t3_dedp4x,1570447978.0,Hi! I am exactly the same when I am at home. It feels good to be “little me” again in my own home where I know I’m finally safe to be her.
ptsd,f2v6kur,t3_decv8h,1570447200.0,I see zero future for me. The next 5 years? Blank. It’s normal to feel this way with PTSD. It blows. Gets tiring because I already feel like a freak but can’t even answer a simple “where do you see yourself in 5 years?” Bs.
CPTSD,f1d0yo1,t3_d8uwsa,1569371007.0,Yeah. My traumas left a path of destruction for years on not mine also others lives. It sucks.
ptsd,f19rhzq,t3_d7vx3x,1569276862.0,Groomed by an adult man starting at 13. Didn’t end til I was 19ish. Lots happened that my parents knew and just didn’t know what to do about. I might be able to relate pretty well. Your trauma is valid. I don’t know who I am out side of who he conditioned me to be. I’m 30 now. I’m so sorry this happened to you.
CPTSD,eytg676,t3_cyp5xj,1567435700.0,I really appreciate everyone’s feedback. Starting to feel a lot less worked up over the gathering. Thank you. ❤️❤️
CPTSD,eytg29i,t1_eytepme,1567435616.0,Thank you so much for this video. Her tips were incredibly helpful ❤️
ptsd,ey5ptvp,t1_ey50ryd,1566837517.0,"Piggy backing off this. Has helped me tremendously with extreme hyper vigilance and not being able to sleep. Keep your use in check and moderated. It can come to the point where no weed=freak out. I’ve gotten to used to using marijuana for sleep that when I don’t smoke, I don’t sleep. Just be mindful."
ptsd,ey3trbq,t3_cv8ffr,1566773486.0,"TRIGGER HEAVY. MUST GET OFF MY CHEST. Can’t stop thinking about your post because it resonates with me. Very similar. I’m obsessed with my rapist/abuser. I haven’t told my therapist. We still communicate. He treats me like shit and then builds me up and I crave it. I don’t know who the hell I am anymore because when I break fee, I’m “happy” but it feels so scary,uncomfortable, and unfamiliar from him and his control. It sounds too crazy to ever tell someone fave to face. He was almost father like to me in some ways more than my biological father so it’s all so fucked up. I’m sorry."
ptsd,expuj3u,t3_ctx7i7,1566494496.0,Hi! I experience the same issues. I go through cycles of intense ptsd followed by a week or two of “almost normal” and during those times...I don’t sleep for shit. My therapist said Benadryl or Zquil is okay to take temporarily for sleep.
cptsdcreatives,euxyefm,t3_chobhf,1564093244.0,Wow. I’ve felt this way for 12 years. Morbidly comforting to know I’m not the only one. I’m sorry.
ptsd,etm3vlp,t3_cc9oyw,1562951475.0,"Not sure what the situation is for medical marijuana where you are but I’ve been smoking daily for 5 years now-never have a dream or I do and I just don’t remember them. Once I quit smoking, they come back. Just something to consider."
rapecounseling,ert6mdf,t3_c3r9yr,1561233881.0,Wtf. Good on you. He should be supporting you right now and wrapping you with love & compassion. Not giving you ultimatums to “prove” the rape was real. I’m so sorry you’re going through this.
ptsd,eqggudk,t3_byc1il,1560036179.0,needed this. those suicide feelings are in full force past 2 days. not existing seems like the only way to rid myself of the demon.

rapecounseling,epyws2y,t3_bwmthg,1559653017.0,"Not bothering me and you are not in anyway being attention seeking/dramatic. Your pain is real. Your pain is valid. I’m sorry for what you are going through. Nobody should have to feel this way or go through this. I get it. I know what you’re feeling, though, if that adds any sort of morbid comfort. I know the pain. I’m right there too. I wish I could make us both better. But in time, with therapy, we will both find our ways. We will. We can."
ptsd,epr1vso,t3_bvlier,1559416716.0,"well..finding some comfort that others also get the whole “FUCK” fiasco that I go through, too."
cptsdcreatives,epjusq4,t1_epjs8yv,1559260960.0,"basically, lurker was my truth. something I denied and denied hardcore for years while destroying myself and my life. And others lives around me. lurker was always lurking behind me the entire time though. my truth followed me (lurked behind me) for 12 years. my truth was a monster. eh. sorry."
cptsdcreatives,epixn9w,t3_buuslb,1559244357.0,Really like this. Accurately depicts the lurker I led around for 12 years.
