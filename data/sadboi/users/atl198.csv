Nurses,fhyzvaj,t3_f599x5,1581987641.0,"I'm an RN who has worked in detox, psychiatry and hospice. I was not formerly a teacher but my sister and 2 cousins who I'm very close to are all teachers currently. I have to say that if I could do it all again, I'm not sure if I would become a nurse. There are several reasons for this but the main one is burnout (due to abuse from patients, the physical toll on my body, and unsafe staffing ratios/always working shortstaffed). 

Nursing has become unfulfilling. I never thought I would say that (and I'd welcome other nurses to chime in), but it's true. I spend 50% of my time doing something (meds, treatments, etc) and at least 50% of my time documenting about what I did. Yes, I'm aware that adds up to potentially more than 100%. That's why I haven't gone to lunch in months. That's why I have to hold it for hours before I have a minute to go to the bathroom. That's why I work 7 to 3 but rarely leave before 4:15. When I worked in Hospice I was literally told by my manager that I was ""spending too much time with the patients"". This was at a job in which I spent 45 minutes of every hour documenting, leaving 15 minutes per hour of patient contact as ""too much"" time with the patient.

Nursing is not what you think it is. It's not what I thought it would be before I switched careers. It's a constant battle to get things done from the minute you arrive at work until the minute you walk out the door, utterly exhausted both mentally and physically. 

Please also consider the hours required in nursing. As a teacher, I am guessing (based on the nurses in my family) that you do not work weekends and that you have summers off. Maybe you work a different job in the summers. In nursing, most new nurses work every other weekend and first shift (7 to 3) jobs are hard to get and pay less than other shifts. It's technically possible to get an 8 to 4 job Monday-Friday but if you think you do more work after your work day is done now, but consider this example. After being a nurse for 5 years I got a job working in hospice. The stated hours were 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and this is what I got paid for. Most days I worked 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. just to finish the volume of work, and so did the other nurses I worked with. Out of a starting class of six nurses in my orientation at the hospice I worked at, there is one person left at the two-year mark. There was absolutely no work-life balance and you did not get paid one penny for the hours you worked over 40.

As I said, myself and most nurses I know spend most of the day just trying to catch up. It is completely anxiety inducing and you get to a point where you start to see the patients as an interruption of your work. Can you see how utterly wrong that is? The only time I get to spend any time at all with my patients is on the weekends when all the administrative people are not working and there are not discharges going on all day. Weekends are also usually the only time I can take a 15 minute lunch and that I get out by 3:30.

So I have been a nurse for about a decade and the only way I am able to get hours that work for me and my family is to work per diem. That means I don't get benefits like time off or insurance. Yes, per diem means I can pick my shifts but I also am the first person to get canceled if the hospital census is low. I pay for my insurance myself and it is not cheap. But I take it as an advantage over having to work every other weekend or work a shift like 3 to 11 p.m. which would completely be unacceptable to me.

Last, I will just give you a snapshot of my typical day. Today I went to work at 7 a.m. and sat in report until 7:30 am. At 7:30 a.m. I immediately ran to the medication room because I was assigned to be ""Med nurse"" today. Our staffing ratio today was good - 3 nurses for 16 patients. However, one nurse is charge nurse and basically sits behind the nurses station all shift and deals with paperwork and any problems that come up. I started passing medications at 8 and finished around 10:30. That's a total of 3 hours standing on my feet handing out medications. And that was just morning Med pass. Throughout the rest of the day I still got medications for patients that had them scheduled or requested them for various things. I spent the rest of my time documenting and transcribing doctor's orders. In-between this I handled requests from patients and assisted in managing the more psychotic and/ or demanding patients on our unit. I worked through lunch and did not eat anything until I got home at 4 p.m. During all this, I dealt with verbal abuse from patients interspersed with the very real threat of physical abuse from the particularly psychotic patients. I got minimal help from my co-workers because they were dealing with a similar time crunch, just with different tasks. Since I was the med nurse, at the end of the shift I had to write in the report book for every single one of our 16 patients and this had to be finished by 3 p.m. . Since I finished giving medications at 2:22 p.m., this was a struggle as it always is. I left feeling exhausted and wracking my brains to try to remember if I had forgotten anything.

I apologize for the length that this has taken on. I had no idea when I started writing this how emotional it was going to make me. This is not a worst-case scenario. This is a normal day in the work life of a normal nurse.

I would also say in closing that because we are so crunched for time and are always rushing I constantly worry about making a medication error and having it affect my license. A career that I thought was going to be fulfilling and let me help people in the way I had always wanted to help them has morphed into a source of anxiety and both physical and emotional stress. I love the patients that I work with, as difficult as they can be. The sad fact is that nursing has become a profession where the patients get in the way of your workload.

Please feel free to message me with any questions. Best of luck to you. I wish I had known some of these things before I went back to school to become a nurse, which I did full-time while also working full-time as a CNA. It was almost impossible and I am still in debt. Good luck."

Psychiatric patients are known for making accusations against staff members at times - both male and female staff members, but it seems much more skewed toward males. No one at the hospital I work at ever goes into a patient room alone. That is basically to protect yourself from any accusations. We don't do as much ""physical"" nursing as other areas of nursing, but we definitely do some. If I have a female patient I always ask right away if she would prefer to have a female staff member. Just take this with a grain of salt because I am dealing with a different population. :)"
