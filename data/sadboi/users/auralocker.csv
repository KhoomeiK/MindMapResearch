depression,fm36n3d,t3_fsg8zk,1585714257.0,"the memories you have with your cat, your friend, are and always will be real, no matter what. I guarantee that even if he can‚Äôt muster the strength, kitty knows you in some way and loves you and will feel better with you there. I know it‚Äôs heartbreaking to watch, but the best way to say goodbye to your friend who has given you so much is to be there with them no matter what. All the love and joy they gave you was real. Death can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt take away all the times your buddy helped you perk up or feel love or just some emotion in this world. Just because something is over, doesn‚Äôt mean it never was! 

I‚Äôm truly sorry you have to go through this and my heart goes out to you, seriously. It never gets easier with these things, but celebrating the life they had and helped you build is always a comfort to me in these times. Just remember that grieving is ok too."

I really do understand wanting to make use of your time, but sometimes if your hobbies are linked to ‚Äúwork‚Äù they can just seem like ‚Äúwork‚Äù and not fun hobbies to some people, so perhaps that is where his headspace is at. Is it possible he‚Äôs trying to help you relax and detach from work with something that is not directly related?

I‚Äôve been in situations like that too and when I do have that happen I feel extremely awkward and feel like I should give that person some extra space. So maybe she‚Äôs finding solace in other members and it‚Äôs happening all over.

MakeupEducation,evo7fjf,t3_ckk9pl,1564640174.0,"So based on your post history it looks like you‚Äôre about twenty! I‚Äôm the same age so I‚Äôll share some of the stuff I use. : ) 
So absolutely starting with washing your face every day, mornings and night, is the best thing to start with. It helps get a lot of sweat, grime and dead skin off your face. 
Are you happy/unhappy with your skin? Do you get lots of blemishes? If you‚Äôre happy with your skin and don‚Äôt need lots of stuff to keep it away (as I do) then I wouldn‚Äôt go too overboard with the stuff you put on your face, so as not to irritate it further more.

Most beauty routines consist of three things: 1 . Cleanser. A cleanser is probably the most basic and help you with the extra push of keeping your pores and skin feeling clear. It gets all the surface level stuff. Currently I use glossier milky jelly cleanser because it‚Äôs so soft, and I really love glossier as a brand. (I really suggest browsing their website for starting makeup!! So fun!!)
2. Toner. What this does is gets all the under the skin grime and really helps keep acne away. I would suggest Thayers Witch Hazel Rose Toner because it smells great and isn‚Äôt too intense. It‚Äôs not too expensive either. 
3. Moisturizer! The reason for this is moisturizer helps your skin absorb all the stuff you‚Äôve just done to it; and also keeps your face so it doesn‚Äôt get too dry in the night :)
You can go for a cream, or Argan oil, there‚Äôs sooo many moisturizers in the market. If you don‚Äôt have specifically dry skin then a cream should do fine. I use Ponds (found at shoppers) 

Sunscreen- it is always a good idea to have this on. Even on grey days, the sun can damage your skin! A moisturizer with SPF in it can make it so you have a 2-in-1 so I‚Äôd poke around for those. Currently I use one from the Ordinary (another brand I suggest as they‚Äôre super inexpensive.) 
As for serums and mud masks- doing a mask once a week or every two weeks I find helps. If there‚Äôs a Lush where you live, go in there and they are so so friendly and can help you get started. 

Makeup is a whole other thing! Make sure to have fun with it and try new things that you think look cool. Even watching one YouTube tutorial can teach you new things! I also use pictures on Pinterest for inspiration when I‚Äôm feeling too bored with my routine.  Like I mentioned Glossier is a great brand as they have ‚Äúsets‚Äù of really natural starter makeup, so if you‚Äôre into the natural looks definitely check them out. If you‚Äôre looking for a similar list of basic makeup to buy I can always recommend  some other products as well! 
Happy learning!"

MakeupRehab,eudz4at,t3_cfvunl,1563731191.0,"I hope it‚Äôs comforting to know that a lot of people feel the same way, including me. For me it stems from wanting to be this ideal, ‚Äúbest version of myself‚Äù person so filling my life with pretty and material things is my way of coping most days. Even though I‚Äôve done therapy, it‚Äôs just really hard to accept yourself as someone who is worthy of love, and friends, etc.  I am not saying buying nice things for yourself is bad. But when it‚Äôs the only thing that makes you feel good, it‚Äôs time to take a step back."
