Makeup,fkin53i,t3_fikl8c,1584223942.0,I use a lighter to curl my lashes. Let it cool down a bit before you put it to your eyes. But it’s been a huge game changer for my straight as hell eyelashes!

introvert,falmebr,t1_falkapx,1576186790.0,Honestly makes me feel better to know that I am not the only one. But it makes me sad that we all have some sort of problems with this.
introvert,fal8opc,t1_fal3w9b,1576180252.0,"Yeah, I feel the exact same way. I have to tell myself it's okay, but it's tough some days."
Anxiety,f4wnljj,t3_dlxd9q,1571858025.0,"Congratulations! This is such a moving story. I still struggle with my anxiety but going to the doctor and getting medication has helped me immensely. It's shocking how different my life is compared to a few years ago. Reach out for help, you may feel like nothing is going to help but change can happen."

Anxiety,f2xvnyy,t3_dep7d3,1570483072.0,"I've been driving since I was 18 and I still get very scared and nervous about it. The more you practice and do it, the better you get and the more comfortable you get.  The nerves are still there but it's okay. Relax and do what you feel comfortable doing, just pay attention and you'll be fine. You're not doing anything wrong. I'm sorry if this doesn't help but I just wanted to help out in some way!"
Anxiety,f24hwo4,t3_dbshzq,1569952458.0,"I relate to this so much. I get so anxious, the smallest and simplest tasks become difficult or I just can't think. I hate it because I feel like I seem stupid to other people. It's gotten worse as I've gotten older. I really hope you feel better. Keep your head up!"
