All she wanted was her children to be happy, and I have an amazing life and a wonderful husband. I just didn't get to say goodbye to her, my siblings did the funeral without me. I didn't get the closure they did, no matter how awful it was.

Thank you again x"

We were supposed to get a revised edition for free but that was 2 years ago and still no sign of it. 

I don't want to name names, but I asked a question about how to overcome my, then, crippling performance anxiety and gain confidence in shouting/screaming and their answer was, 'Eh, there isn't anything you can do, just get over it'. Solid coaching there.

Just my opinion though, I'm sure there are a lot of positive experiences but it really wasn't worth the couple 100 dollars I paid."

Does she like the odd pampering? Do something small that makes her feel appreciated, a small surprise.  Even if she's not in the mood to receive it, it will register with her when she is in a good mood and will appreciate it. Little things mean so much when nothing else works. Tulsi tea is good for anxiety, make her a cuppa if the weather isn't too hot where you are.

Ask if she wants a hug or a foot rub. Have her put her head on your lap and stroke her hair. Sometimes I don't want to be touched at all but my husband will ask if I'd like a hug, he understands. My heart goes out to you both."

Think of your Mom if she were still here physically and you were feeling this way, wouldn't she want you to feel better? I know it takes a helluva lot of effort, willpower and strength to do, but hang in there until you're ready and then talk to your doctor, who can steer you in the right direction. 

There is also grief counseling, which is specifically designed for grief. You have endured a trauma, don't forget that. You are enduring a trauma, and you are surviving even when you feel like giving up. Please don't. I really hope you take my advice. 

Also, talk to your Mom. I find it helps me if I'm in a desperate state of grief, sometimes I just feel her warmth and I become calm. I'm not even super religious or anything, it just helps to know that she loves me too much to leave me entirely. Your Mom does too. The love for their babies is neverending ‚ù§Ô∏è

I do feel like I'm lying when I say I love her though, that part is still blank or numb.

Anyway, just wanted to let you know that you're not alone. Just look at all the people coming forward here with their own stories of loss and love. It's a unique heartbreak which binds us.

driving,fp8kbpp,t3_gbsswx,1588394579.0,"Hi! I have an Anxiety Disorder and I never, ever thought I'd be able to drive. I am 32. Just like yourself, I got my learner's permit this year in January due to a spontaneous burst of confidence (go us!). 

Actually driving the vehicle was terrifying though. I didn't think I'd ever get good at it, I was destined to let my fear cripple me and never learn from my mistakes. I learn something new every time I get into the car now and am oddly confident. Even my husband says I have improved greatly (I had a huge problem veering to the right without realising, which I am still working on. Even my husband, who  has been driving for 16 years roughly, makes mistakes the odd time. Just look at all the shitty drivers out there, they passed their test somehow. Trust me, you are doing AMAZING!) 

I've had panic attacks due to driving, the thing to remember is be kind to yourself. If you feel too anxious to drive, give yourself another day or two. There's loads of time to practice, and well done you for doing all the practice so far! 

I hope this helps, keep 'er lit! You're doing great!"
