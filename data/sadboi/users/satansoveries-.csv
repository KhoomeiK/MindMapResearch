edit: i looked it up, the fear of sharp objects is aichmophobia. don’t look it up because when you do you immediately see a lot of little tiny sharp objects and big knives too. i think the fear of small cuts and sharp objects are under the same name because every time i looked up ‘fear of small cuts’ only the fears of injury, blood, and sharp objects showed up and you said you aren’t afraid of blood or bigger wounds like broken bones and such."

emetophobia,f6rhqv2,t1_f6rg7av,1573104465.0,"thank you. it’s just been going on for about an hour and it got to me. i took ibuprofen and my ears feel better. still freaking out, but at least it as bad as it was earlier."
emetophobia,f6qucgc,t3_dsjf2d,1573086130.0,"god i cannot believe people like her. they’re inconsiderate, ignorant, selfish assholes. if you’ve been sick all night, STAY HOME at LEAST for the next 24 hours or so. i’m sorry you have to deal with this burden. it’s so stressful knowing someone around you has been sick and there’s nothing you can do but wait and sanitize everything lol. but i’m sure you will be okay, you didn’t come in direct contact with any of her that could actually get you sick, plus our paranoid minds make us clean everything after something like that happens, so honestly, i think you won’t get sick, and i know that doesn’t help at all, i’ve been there, but just go over the facts and know that you will be okay. :)"
mentalhealth,f6pt4w1,t3_dsgo46,1573063698.0,"for me it’s hormones, like sometimes during my cycle i’ll feel really pretty and i’ll want to go places and do things i usually wouldn’t, and then other times i’ll hate myself so much i think about ways i can change myself and change my appearance and shit. it really sucks and i understand what you’re going through, i probably can’t help because idk how to stop it either, but i just wanted to say i know how you feel :/"
findareddit,f6psx6r,t1_f6plyhc,1573063566.0,"not very many. i’m kind of in the middle of nowhere, but about fifteen minutes from a big highway. but as i said, it’s only happened once before at around the same time of day and only for about an hour until it completely disappeared."
findareddit,f6plt9v,t1_f6pkeid,1573059178.0,i thought it was me going crazy but i tried videoing it and got it in the video.
findareddit,f6plqqx,t1_f6pkeid,1573059132.0,"i honestly have no idea. i just moved here about three months ago and it’s only happened once before, and that time it was early in the morning just like this time. i live on thé top floor in the very front of the house so i can hear what’s happening in the neighborhood, but it’s a weird medium pitched ring that goes up and down in volume, and at first, it’s so loud that it wakes me up, but then it gets really quiet. it almost sounds like a tool is being used but then it gets quieter and continues not making and sense."
emetophobia,f5otv4a,t1_f5o6nd6,1572331934.0,"they do. we also have a really good family friend that stays with us, that i have learned to kind of hate recently. she was told before she even moved in that i have emet and that she is most definitely not allowed to tease me or show any signs of being sick while around me, yet she will gag, cough shit up, tell me her stomach hurts, etc. and my mom recently told her again so that she would stop, but she never stopped. so yeah, telling people sometimes makes it worse. it sucks having a phobia like this."
DidntKnowIWantedThat,f54dcyo,t3_dmdo1x,1571978323.0,it looks soooo easy and then i try it and fail miserably
emetophobia,f4wnish,t1_f4wef2w,1571857994.0,"it does suck. especially when you share a bathroom with three other girls, one of which doesn’t really care about v, so they basically disregard my fear and gag and shit to be ‘funny’."
emetophobia,f4wn4vt,t3_dli2zh,1571857853.0,"this did help A LOT. and although i have six siblings and they can catch it out of mere stupidity and their non-hygienic tendencies, at least i know that i might not get it thanks to my emet tendencies lol. thank you so much, this needs to be seen by every emet out there."
emetophobia,f4pex17,t3_dlb2ui,1571727104.0,"i have learned very well, and on my own how to talk myself out of panic attacks that have to do with how IM feeling. i’m proud of myself, even though i’m not very good with situations including other people, i’m still trying my best. and i’m proud of you for trying too. this phobia really does mess with your head sometimes."
mentalhealth,f4beutn,t3_dk5d4k,1571511388.0,"i don’t personally have this as much, but i have felt this sometimes. it’s weird and really unpleasant. i started scratching or pinching myself every time it started to happen, i don’t self harm, it’s just little pinched to make me feel human again, y’know?

(edit: had to fix a word lol)"
emetophobia,f4behbu,t3_djzhzj,1571511214.0,"i couldn’t watch them, and usually i try and block the sound out because it’s so fucking gross, but i can clean it up without it making me anxious. i can even look at it, and i usually do to make sure they aren’t throwing up something bad. it makes me nauseated, but never really anxious. it’s odd, this phobia."
mentalhealth,f49a94a,t1_f4847ka,1571460569.0,i’ll consider it :)
godtiersuperpowers,f47s749,t3_djm0z6,1571427173.0,"this would be amazing wtf i would do everything, i would finally learn how to drive, watch the sunrise ever morning, clean up, etc. 

wow my life is pathetic"
mentalhealth,f47qs67,t1_f46jxgq,1571426491.0,"thank you, and it probably was a bit of a head cold, mixed with not eating or drinking lol. i’m feeling a lot better now though, thank you."
mentalhealth,f47q5cn,t1_f45hl54,1571426295.0,"this is exactly what i’ve been doing. i did it before i moved, and after. nothing changed except where i was. i’ve gone through shows on hulu and netlifx over and over again and it’s getting really irritating and boring. it just helps to know i’m not completely alone."
