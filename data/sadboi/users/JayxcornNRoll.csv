Dreams,fp0g3sg,t1_fom9u6w,1588208584.0,I'd had a dream like this! i'm just remembering it. And i think it could've been the same fucking name! that's crazy as fuck. He told me to do something like write his name down and i couldn't remember it at all besides that it started with a k if everything's correct. if this is true... Then i have no idea what to think. I'm not spiritual at all or religious so i'd definitely have to reevaluate some stuff lmao
Dreams,fp0fi8n,t3_g85ima,1588208259.0,"Apparently your brain can't do that. Any face you see in a dream is a face you've seen in your waking life. even a stranger's face. Maybe you saw the face in a youtube ad or walking down the block. So yes these faces, according to studies are real. But i'm still sketchy about it because these studies also say you can read in dreams and i can read in all of my dreams that the opportunity presents itself and i can also tell time in my dreams."
mentalhealth,f7lx6hw,t3_dwmnok,1573849740.0,This has been happening a lot lately. Ok sorry you're going through that. You should take a break from the internet for a bit and maybe get some kind of help like therapy or admit yourself or something. I was admitted once. It's really not bad. It'll probably help you let o of the anxiety. I don't know. But I hope you find help.

mentalhealth,f6v83qe,t3_dt6mcp,1573179101.0,"I relate to you about the hiding trauma part. I don't really have friends though. I'm 16, f and I have only like 2 people that i talk to on the internet regularly. 
I feel like if I talk about it too much it'll look like I'm just looking for attention. Especially since I literally have told anyone about my fucked up childhood. I've only been diagnosed with depression and anxiety because I didn't tell the doctor about all the abuse I went through. So yeah, awkward as hell to just being something like that up. Don't really want to because I also don't want people to feel like they need to give me pity or something. I only vent over the internet occasionally because I don't like having to not say anything about it, sometimes I just need to talk about it to get it off my chest. I think compartmentalizing what happened for so long gave me enough time to sorta pretend that it never happen? Idk. I hope some day you can talk about your trauma openly to someone and that you can get help with getting through it."
