AskReddit,fo46qfn,t3_g53q03,1587499140.0,"Found out from a mutual friend that she had been making up lies about me, telling people all sorts of things that weren't true. She was a really POS friend to me the last 6mo - year we were friends and did a lot of awful things to me. She went and told everyone the stories about what she did, but switched the story around to tell everyone I was doing the bad things to her. I had no idea because we only had that one mutual friend, which I didn't meet until right at the end of the friendship. Turns out the POS friend did her wrong too but the POS friend told me about it so I reached out to the other girl and we together came to the conclusion she had been lying to both of us about a lot of things. I had been at the POS friend's house the night before I talked to the mutual friend and she was so rude and hateful towards me that I left first thing that morning without talking to her. Soon after I found out all the BS, haven't talked to the POS friend since and never plan to again :)"

bipolar,eunfovi,t1_eug2r07,1563928181.0,I just recently did that and I feel much better but def keep an eye on your anxiety! Once I came off mine the anxiety skyrocketed but we are working to solve that now. Good luck :)

bipolar,etx4x7a,t3_cdrdc7,1563291594.0,I know it’s difficult and I’m so proud of you.
bipolar,er38mds,t1_er380do,1560458071.0,"Yep, same here. They want to put me on things that slow my heart rate (which helps for the physical part of anxiety/panic attacks) but all of those literally just knock me out or make me outwardly calm but mentally in complete disparity."
bipolar,er38au9,t1_er2fg5r,1560457887.0,"Mine did that for the first month on it but thankfully it has almost entirely subsided. Some days I see traces of that issue lingering, but not to the point it concerns me. I hope things get better for you."
