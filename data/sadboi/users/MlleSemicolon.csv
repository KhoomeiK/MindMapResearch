I just filled out the BCCDC COVID-19 survey that was announced today. According to my records, and based on a couple of the questions asked in the survey, by my accounts I was very likely sick with the virus, first showing symptoms on Feb. 12., with symptoms persisting all the way to at least Feb. 27th.


I know that whatever bug I got came from close contact I had during a group meeting in a health care setting: on Feb. 6th I had the unfortunate luck to be the last one to arrive at the meeting, and there was only one chair available. A few minutes later, the guy sitting to my left (literally about 2 feet between his chair and those to his left and right) goes on to tell everyone (about 15 people) that he was very sick the week before. His voice was still raspy and congested.


I thought to myself: ""Fuck."" Why on earth did this person decide it was ok to come to that meeting, where he knew he'd be sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with others, in a closed room for about 2.5 hours... in a health care facility? And the facilitators were totally ok with that?


At that time I wasn't aware of anything related to the virus, but I immediately got concerned because, despite being in very good physical health otherwise, I have a history with bronchitis and asthma. It doesn't happen that I get sick with it as much anymore, but there's always the risk.



Fast forward to about 6 days later (Feb. 12): I'm wheezing, coughing, congested, the works.


By Feb. 27, I was having the worst gastrointestinal issues I've had in a very long time. Bad enough that I thought I'd have to call 911, or that I'd need to spend the night in my own bathroom. That went on for about 3 days. I thought I had eaten something bad, though I couldn't think of anything.


So... after filling out the survey today, I thought I'd have a look at the joint statements by the Ministry of Health and PHO related to the virus, to see if maybe the health care facility where my meeting was in Feb. had just been careless and not followed provincial advice.

Found nothing alarming in those earlier joint statements (February) except ""wash your hands and proceed as you would with influenza, stay home if sick, risk is low, blah blah blah"".


At the end of the survey there's the option to get contacted for serology tests. I'm very curious to see if they'll follow up with me. And if I have the antibodies / have been infected.



All of this to tell you that, in as much as BC hasn't (at least as of yet, thankfully) got hit as hard as Ontario, QC, NY, you can allow yourself a bit of schadenfreude."

>A wet market (also called a public market) is a marketplace selling **fresh meat, fish, produce**, and other perishable goods.


Just like the areas selling fresh prawns in Steveston (Canada), or oysters in Montreal. Yes, there are butchers and fishmongers in Brazil, just as there are in Canada and in the US. The point I'm trying to show you is that **wildlife markets** are not common in Brazil (the largest country in South America). The article makes it sound like **wildlife markets** are common in South America. That's an unfounded sweeping generalization by the article. Or at the very least, it could've been more specific. South America is an incredibly large area. 


Also, if you want to quote Wikipedia, here's an excerpt from the same page you pulled text from:

>**Not all wet markets sell live animals** but the term wet market is sometimes used to signify a live animal market in which vendors slaughter animals upon customer purchase. Wet markets are common in many parts of the world, notably in China and Southeast Asia, and include a wide variety of markets, such as **farmers' markets, fish markets**, and wildlife markets.
> Most **wet markets do not trade in wild or exotic animals**, but those that do have been linked to outbreaks of zoonotic diseases.

Sometimes the best they can do is work part time or volunteer, but not many employers can or are able to make accommodations for mental health challenges."

Thing is, except for very extreme cases that involve delusion, paranoia, etc, many people who have a mental illness still know right from wrong. I can't speak about what's like with addiction, though, as thankfully that's not one of the battles I fight. But having a mental illness doesn't excuse anyone from being a jerk. I'd say that showing the person the error of their ways, forcing them to make up for what they've done, is actually an important part of helping the individual manage their life. In other words, their responsibility for crimes is to be alleviated, but within reason. 

Onto your other point, for sure, in the case of certain mental diagnosis alcohol just exacerbates issues. There's a reason why psychiatrists ask during follow-up consultations about alcohol and drug consumption. So, yes, reducing access to alcohol, pawn shops, etc, would be a way to protect them and others."

worldnews,fne1c0t,t3_g0q6po,1586881310.0,"As someone who has lived in Brazil, has travelled extensively there, and has strong ties to people living in the state of Sao Paulo, the city of Sao Paulo, and a smaller resort town half-way between the city of Sao Paulo and Rio (Ubatuba),  I find there's a certain subtle prejudice in this report, a lack of context, and a lot of misinformation in the article and in the comments in this thread. It seems people automatically think of all of Brazil as having the same kind of social economical level, and that health care there is awful, that everyone is uneducated, etc.

So let me shed some light here.

The article states:

>The **government has focused on testing serious cases rather than all suspected cases**, according to the consortium, known as the Center for Health Operations and Intelligence. The center and medical professionals have also complained of long wait times to get test results.

If you think this is a practice exclusive to Brazil, and ""of course, Brazil would be like that, 'cause they're a thirld-word country, blah blah blah"", that has also been the method adopted in British Columbia, Canada -- a province that's being hailed as one of the examples for other Canadian provinces. I'm from Vancouver, and that's exactly what health authorities are doing here. Having symptoms doesn't guarantee you'll get a test. Most people here aren't able to get tested, because even if you call your GP and he/she says you have symptoms matching COVID-19, you can't get tested unless you're in really bad shape.

Yes, Balsonaro is an ass. The reason why he got elected is because the previously elected leftist presidents (Lula and Dilma-what's-her-name) managed to fuck things up big time.

Many had seen the Labour Party (where Lula and Dilma came from) as hope after decades of mismanagement, blatant corruption, elitism, etc. That didn't happen. So Balsonaro's election was partly a product of backlash against that; the pendulum swinging to the complete opposite end of the spectrum.

I don't know what the other options were candidate-wise, but there you go. Still, just as many well-educated people voted for Balsonaro, many well-educated people voted against him. You can't look at a country with a population of 212,236,662 and make a judgement across the board that everyone voted for him, just as we can't look at the US and think that ""everyone voted for Trump, hence every American is an idiot.

My contacts tell me that, at least in Ubatuba, a city of 90,799 residents, social distancing / quarantine measures were put into place weeks ago. All beaches are closed to the public. Tourists have been discouraged from going there for vacation/long weekends (like this past weekend). Beaches are mostly empty. Lockdown will go on in Ubatuba until at least April 22nd. Mayors of some coastal cities even tried blocking highways (but weren't able to, as it's not legal).

Local and state governments know that Balsonaro is a COVIDIOT and have taken matters into their own hands. In Ubatuba, there has been a large donation drive for blankets, clothes, etc, for homeless folks who have been brought in from the streets to an indoor stadium, to reduce their risk of contracting the disease.

Brazil is a huge country: ""If one only takes into account the contiguous United States, which crucially excludes the 663,300 square miles that comprise the state of Alaska, the United States is slightly smaller than Brazil at 3,043,615 square miles"" ([Source](https://www.reference.com/geography/big-brazil-compared-united-states-56968ef3254dc323)).

Health care / economical realities greatly vary between one region and another. For perspective, **the city** of Sao Paulo alone has the 18th highest GDP in the world (per city). ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_cities_by_GDP)). The 2019 GDP for the **state** of Sao Paulo was **US$** 407,451,351,573.47 (that's **US$** **407 billion** \- [Source](https://www.ibge.gov.br/explica/pib.php) \- I can read Portuguese). For comparison, the GDP for the state of Maryland in 2018 was **US$412.92** billion ([Source)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/248023/us-gross-domestic-product-gdp-by-state/). But the same metric for the state of Pernambuco, where another large Brazilian city is located (Recife), was US$34,905,906,506.38. (that's **US$34 billion).** By comparison, Vermont was the US state with the lowest GDP in 2018: US$33.73 billion). Wyoming was second last, with US$39.37 billion.

Brazil itself has the 9th highest GDP in the world ([2018 data from the World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=true&view=map&year_high_desc=true)), higher than Canada, Russia, South Korea, Australia, Spain, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, UAE.

The point is: a short article by Reuters doesn't give an accurate view of the many different realities around COVID-19 in Brazil. What's happening in the state of Sao Paulo, as an example, wouldn't be the same as in another more distante, isolated state, like Acre. There are many world-class health care service providers in Brazil, but unfortunately they're mostly in the Southeastern area of the country (states of Sao Paulo, Rio).

When reading an article like this, keep in mind that there's still a huge amount of North American / European prejudice from news sources. Not to say that there aren't people in Brazil who at first thought COVID-19 was ""just the flu"", but that also happened in Canada, US, France..."
