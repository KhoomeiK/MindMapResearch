bipolar,fbgsa98,t3_ecy81m,1576857421.0,"In my late teens, early 20s, I couldn't hold down a job for more than a few months. I've been at my current company for over 2 years now (24f). It's hard and I've had to take a few sick days (""stomach flu,"" but I'm pretty sure they all know it's mental health related). They all know I take medication and go to therapy, but they don't know my exact diagnosis and they don't need to."
