Pure consoles were seen and poor and crude compared to arcades, and with PCs becoming more accessible in the 80's the focus shifted to them.

The Amiga, the Commodore 64, and to a lesser extent the MSX were the de-facto gaming platforms in the early 80's, and their rise in popularity was precisely one of the reasons why Atari and the other pure consoles went under (the commodore was specifically marketed as a serious tool for work and education, that was *also* a console, so basically 3-in-1). The software companies just moved to them (in fact, many big companies like EA and Activision predate the crash, and they fared just fine on the PC market).

Yes, the market today would be very different without Nintendo, that can never be denied. They would have shooken up the industry regardless of what had happened in the early 80's, because the Famicon was an absolute sales juggernault.

LateStageCapitalism,fljm5ba,t1_flizu4j,1585218513.0,Thanks for reminding me of that book! Sade's a wholly underappreciated author.
