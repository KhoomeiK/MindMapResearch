BipolarReddit,fntrs7m,t3_g3m4km,1587247455.0,"Thanks :) needing it now! Currently I‚Äôm not on anything. I was on lithium and buspirone for physiological anxiety and zopiclone when I left. I kept it up for a few months, went back to my job, felt very depressed and that it wasn‚Äôt helping, so I made the bold choice to go off, and test myself off of it, because it wasn‚Äôt benefiting my life, essentially just preventing a manic episode. It wasn‚Äôt worth it for me! 

It‚Äôs been a long journey and it‚Äôs a long painful story I have to remember every day, but I‚Äôm learning every day to cope in my own way. I KNOW the most important this is sleep and a healthy environment. And I should know by now if I start feeling manic again. It took me a long time to understand what was happening to me. 

*Sigh* it‚Äôs a complicated life we have to live. 
I ended up typing more of my story below just because all the memories were flooding back. It‚Äôs not written nice - it‚Äôs all over the place - but it was therapeutic getting it off my chest and out into the ether I guess. Don‚Äôt feel obligated to read but if you want to read feel free! I‚Äôm new to Reddit I hope this isn‚Äôt strange? Lol



I had a bad experience during my first involuntary hospitalization in Feb 2016. The docs drugged me up with so much abilify that I don‚Äôt remember anything except laying in bed for 8 days. It fucked me up for years after that with my personality and functioning. Even worse is that is my parents got a court order to get me there. Cops came to my step dads and I was dragged out in handcuffs - my parents never even told me or sat me down for a conversation that they thought I needed to be hospitalized. I would have sat and listened. But they weren‚Äôt there for me at the time. There was no reason it should‚Äôve happened the way it did is what I‚Äôm saying. 

I‚Äôve been so so So Confused about this for years that it‚Äôs really made me think, if I don‚Äôt have my family looking out for me or supporting me then what do I have? I felt betrayed. And have been battling with this feeling - it‚Äôs the worst ever. Because I don‚Äôt know why they did what they did. And I was going through the worst time in my life and the way they handled me, I‚Äôll never forgive or forget. 


About a week or two before the 2016 hospitalization, I was raped in my step dads house by my step dads friend during a party. I was staying with my step dad - even slept on the floor for a bit - because my mom kicked me out on Christmas Eve - now February during this time at my step dads. 

(The way I lived my whole life, everything that was happening was very out of character and how my parents treated me - I think I got the brunt of their separation.)

So, my mom came to my step dads a few days later with a bag of misfit shit of mine. She wouldn‚Äôt let me get my own belongings. And since you don‚Äôt know me, fashion is one of my biggest passions, I always get noticed for it, it‚Äôs me. And all I had for months at my step dads was what I packed up for 3 days Christmas activities and the 2 times she dropped off old sweats and just fake laughed with my step dad. 


I told her that I got raped and she told me I was lying, and then said that I shouldn‚Äôt ruin someone else‚Äôs life if I go to the police. The fucking irony is insane. I was so scared and alone and also experiencing mania for months and that was the first time I went to my GP for sleeping pills and anti depressants because I couldn‚Äôt cope!. Fast forward to weeks later im being dragged in handcuffs to a cop car going to a hospital - my parents didn‚Äôt  tell me anything about what was going on. I was blindsided as it was set up. My step dad drove me to his place specifically for me to get taken to the hospital by police. Mentioned above ^

Needless to say I was anti meds after that experience. From the doctor at least, they didn‚Äôt help me. I had akathesia side effects from it that were so uncomfortable. 

Then, last March in Canada, I had another manic episode and got arrested for mischief, lol. I got taken to jail and was in court that day and got released after about 8 hours. I‚Äôve never been arrested before, let alone charged. My parents were in the court room and we left. They tell me where the car is so I walk ahead - I had bruises all over me from the cops and was in jail all day, I needed to walk fast. Well, I looked back and they were gone. I had no phone, no money, or my house key, just the clothes on my back. So I go into an adidas store because I was in the city center and called my parents 3 times. No luck, rang to voicemail, which I thought was odd because I was technically missing at this point and I had no way of getting ‚Äòhome‚Äô. 

Fast forward and I got arrested again for shop lifting. I needed out of my jail clothes and tried to walk out of the store and got caught. My intention was my parents would pick up their phones, pick me up, bring my money because I had well enough to pay for everything. The cops took me straight to the mental hospital ER and then I went to the inpatient unit for weeks and refused to talk to my parents. They don‚Äôt care and they‚Äôve told me that (well my mom specifically, anything mean she‚Äôs said to me).

The funny part to me is that I know she is jealous of me. I (had) a great life and a lot of friends and a lot of experiences, interests, smarts, humour, a mind of my own, I was happy and healthy. However, she is so manipulative now almost like she‚Äôs trying to ruin my life. I was living in BC for school in 2015. In the summer, I came home to Toronto for my grandpas funeral. My parents had just separated and moved to different houses while I was at uni, to this day I have not seen my belongings other than what was placed at my moms and what was in BC. Anyway, my mom ends up kicking me out and not paying for my flight back to school and I ended up losing all my belongings and also a year of school! Since I was 3 years old my mom was saying how she‚Äôs paying for my school - so this wasn‚Äôt a debate. She fucked me over. Then a few months later was my first hospitalization- and remember, I got there only through a court order. She tried other stuff through my doctor before that but since I was over 18 she couldn‚Äôt. Her last resort was a court order. Yet she NEVER talked to me. I feel like a lot could have been avoided, and I wouldn‚Äôt of had to go through so much pain if I just didn‚Äôt come home at all. 

I can‚Äôt shake the fact that I wouldn‚Äôt have been here, with all this trauma, if my mom didn‚Äôt fuck me over. They didn‚Äôt protect me at all. Considering post hospital I get treated horribly. 

I‚Äôve brought up the rape recently and the ditching me from court (which eventually led to my hospitalization) and my mom mocks me. She literally mocks me when I bring up my rape and how she didn‚Äôt help me. Like wtf? 
And secondly, not making sure I was safe after I left court, she just said oh you ran ahead, and I said I waited at where my step dad said his car would be and called multiple times. This mindfuckery and evil behaviour from my mom has destroyed the past 5 years of my life. However, I don‚Äôt want to throw blame but that is the truth. 

I still live with her unfortunately because I can‚Äôt afford not to right not in this expensive city but I know that when I leave when the isolation ends, I will never come back here or speak with her again. Oh god, please let‚Äôs hope that day is soon. I want to move back to amsterdam :) (I did an exchange there and was planning a move before quar). Wish me luck!"
BipolarReddit,fnti3k3,t1_fntf9te,1587242100.0,I hope you can get it figured out soon. I was in the unit for about 4 weeks (seeing my psych every day discussing the meds and levels was 1000% better than how my first psych was) & it took that long to figure out what what was working. Good luck! Sending virtual support!
BipolarReddit,fnsd2d2,t3_g3m4km,1587218952.0,"They prescribed this to me at the inpatient unit. The side effects outweigh what it‚Äôs supposed to do - for me at least. So I begged them to not take it and I stopped. Also, for me, it made me SO groggy and irritable during the day that it ruined my day. I‚Äôve had other sleeping pills that work simply (zopiclone) but seroquel was a devil pill."
canada,fno8bkf,t1_fnnc7qa,1587115900.0,My step dad told us we‚Äôd not get out of Ontario the first day (Toronto to BC drive) - we did. Beasts we are! Also - how underrated is Lake Superior? Beautiful to drive through.

bipolar,fnlnx20,t3_g2dpgg,1587056734.0,Thanks for the tips on how to start! I love drawing and paint watercolours (and took a painting class at a gallery‚Äîmissing those right now). It‚Äôs a meditative practice to me that I don‚Äôt often do enough. Nows the time to get creative and get me some acrylics and canvas! Where do you find your inspiration? I love inadvertently finding out personal style of work after producing a bunch of stuff. I find a lot of us with bipolar are very creative.
