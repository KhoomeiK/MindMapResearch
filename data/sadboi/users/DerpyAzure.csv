dating_advice,fk2qwj5,t1_fk2qjvu,1583807086.0,"Fair point, but either way, it's pretty unnecessary on this particular thread. People here are sharing their problems and trying to relate to each other, and this guy's like ""Lol, can't relate,"" like...did anyone ask at all?"
dating_advice,fk1drbb,t1_fk16iye,1583777603.0,Take your humble bragging elsewhere then; no one asked you.
soulworkeronline,fgfvb1y,t1_fbhq3zd,1580748396.0,"Fr, not everyone likes playing with female characters, **especially** if you're gonna genderlock the game. Fan service is nice but too much becomes a problem."

teenrelationships,fer2trx,t1_fepuv7a,1579349040.0,Thank you very much!
teenrelationships,fepdo7d,t1_fenuonu,1579317947.0,"That is a possibility, but with the way he spoke on the regular, I doubt it. It's not his personality."
teenrelationships,fepdl19,t1_feowm48,1579317886.0,"Yeah, I figured it wouldn't be wise to entirely leave him be. I tried speaking to him in short intervals today, eventually saying how quiet he's gotten. He said no one has really been talking to him and then I replied with, ""But I'm trying to talk to you,"" and he hasn't responded since..."

Vent,favdjuz,t3_eajqyr,1576357856.0,It's funny because they'll *assume* you're cutting them off when you were literally speaking first. It's so irritating and it's the fastest way to make my mom start screaming in an argument.
dankmemes,f9gi6xa,t3_e4uo6t,1575299715.0,I felt that.
Maplestory,f8fzdvn,t1_f8ftzvf,1574551613.0,"That's understandable, and no I don't click as it launches. The longest I've waited for it to launch before clicking was at least 5 minutes or somewhere around that range. I'll try and see how long it can go without me interrupting though."
Maplestory,f8fmk0l,t1_f8fli2t,1574546153.0,Well sorry for wanting to see if I should get back into the game or not??? I scrolled through this subreddit quite a bit to a couple days back and I haven't really seen a similar question yet. The most I see is people complaining about the Glory update. And I'm checking every option available to me before I go bump heads with Nexon's lackluster customer service because I'd rather read forums and get advice from others with similar issues than wait days at a time for help.
Mabinogi,f8bkijd,t1_f8bi2os,1574439026.0,Thank you :) Do you have any tips for making money too?
Mabinogi,f8bjqgz,t1_f8bjfz8,1574438498.0,I've tried that. Didn't really work if I'm posting this question. ;/

instantkarma,ey5wd4r,t1_ey3rx70,1566841870.0,"""That kid got what he deserved.""

Yes, he was pretty fucking stupid, but you do think he deserved to have his whole face ripped apart? His jaw was barely hanging to his face, a huge chunk of his cheek was gone. He looked like he had a damn shotgun blasted into his face. Yeah, I'm all for animal rights, but you people are just so sick and cruel."
