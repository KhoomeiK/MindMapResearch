stimuluscheck,fnbiijw,t3_fyv2nh,1586816131.0,"Hi. I'm kinda freaking out now for some reason from all of thia information. And now am afraid I wont be getting my check. 

I have been receiving Social Security for a permanent   disability since I was a minor. My parents had always handled that end of things and I also have never had to make any kind of claims (even now) unless I worked the minimum hours allowed by Social security at a job. I have not worked in 7 years while receiving an experimental treatment so I have not filed and had not been required to. 
I'm also in my 20s and am having a real issue fully understanding all the different types of social security that are mentioned, and  that for one (or more?) there are certain groups who have to file online? The ""Non filers"" as the IRS site calls it.  How do I know if I am one of them? Or if I need to do that because I don't have to file as per the kind I have. So this very confusing.

I don't know if I should do what the IRS website says anyway to be safe OR i am ok because Social Security has all my info and my bank account/direct deposit info and will be sending me a check so i can stop bugging out. 

Am I making sense to anyone who could kind of, explain it simplistically? 

Thanks folks, I hope you are all doing well and staying safe during this crazy time."

And the mental exhaustion is definitely brutal. You have to remember go take time out for yourself. Even just an hour. Take a power nap (Id probably fall into a coma I'm so beat lol) Or catch up on a show, book, anything YOU love. No matter how big your family, kids or not, you are not being selfish always remember that. Keeping yourself sane and healthy is a must. You cant be there for others if you aren't close to 100% yourself. 

As for clothes, I actually asked my uncle who is an MD and he said that washing whatever you wear out, strip down and wash as soon as you can don't re-wear it. Excluding a jacket or light coat. He said the hottest setting with regular detergent is fine. But not to wear anything twice. I found that I will have ""lounge wear"" aka comfy clothes while home that I change into and only dully dress when I go out to save laundry loads. And just do it when you can, it is ok to keep it in a plastic bag like you are and then doing a full load at the end of the week for example. Common sense really. Washing your hands works right? Same with clothes. You've got this. 👍

I teach from home now and my HS AP English juniors seem to think this is more a ""holiday"". I can see when and who logs in, 13 out of 22. Oy vey! But! I can lecture tiny jim jams so that's a plus. 

The delivery orders are hit or miss here. Like you I can wait two even 2 and 1/2 weeks before needing a delivery. It was just too crazy when I went out, and at 6am! ShopRite and Wegmans by me were like a scene out of the hunger games. I've also found smaller grocers, and also a deli/liquor store (Artisan so a bit pricey) have begun curbside pick up so that is a last resort. 

I have been cooking recipes that freeze well trying to save the non- perishables. (Doubling the recipes to bring portions to a few neighbors who are ill or at risk and cannot leave only to get a once a day ""Meals on Wheels"" delivery. ) Breaks my heart when their own children don't step up. I am legally my mothers cater once she was diagnosed with early onset. But, it is truly all worth the exhaustion. 

I hope you and yours are staying safe and are all healthy, I appreciate the response and also apologize for the novel length response of my own. Anything for some social interaction. 

Keep hanging in there. We will all get through this. Take good care! ✌"
preppers,fmb2551,t1_fmav108,1585916183.0,"Wow. Thank you so much, this is fantastic information and much needed. I appreciate the time and knowledge put in. I had no clue how fast and technical so much of this is."
preppers,fm96s4c,t1_fm8w19d,1585862792.0,Sweet. Now right now I can work with that. Thanks I appreciate the info. And I've got mote than enough bandanas.
CoronavirusNJ,fm8fzdw,t1_flyx4h9,1585848726.0,"Oh honey, I am so with you on the exhaustion and you sound like me. Plus doing for the few in my community that can't go out, I do sometimes wish it was just me, Id be fine. But you are doing something amazing. But! You and your health must always come first. Its not being selfish not at all. We can't give or help others if we are not 100% . if you ever need to chat or just vent I'm here. Hang in there and YOU stay safe."
CoronavirusNJ,fm8fjsd,t1_fly9qzq,1585848502.0,"Very smart. That is what we did. Well, I did. Yesterday I hit up our ShopRite, it was like the hunger games! And at 6am. But upon coming home we sanitized everything immediately needed and put the rest in the back storage room. I always toss any packaging especially from the post delivery. Instacart here is impossible I would love the option. Basically stalking the page for an opening is all one can do.
Wal-Mart delivery from their supercenters has been quite reliable. O really don't want to go out unless absolutely necessary, and I teach online all afternoon so its AM trips if needed which is kinda good.  Just be careful! One can never be too careful. Stay healthy!"
preppers,fm8ex9n,t1_fm8dj39,1585848173.0,Oh it absolutely does! Thank you so much for going out of your way. So appreciated. Just trying to get by and your help is immense. Be safe!
preppers,fm8bwqb,t3_ftpc4w,1585846571.0,You guys (and/or gals) kill me. Levity. Its quite cute.
preppers,fm8brct,t3_ftpc4w,1585846493.0,"Well...honestly I didn't expect it to turn into this. And the panic didn't set in right away. I have no excuse other than being naive and I was in Uni, we were consistently being told not to panic. Until we were all kicked out and sent home. Then it set in. And there is the financial aspect with one parental not being present and a little sis to look after. Really I was all over the place I cant make excuses. Of course now I should have probably listened to the bells and whistles. 

Don't think I don't feel like a complete idiot now. 👍"
preppers,fm89zd0,t1_fm89nyw,1585845559.0,Cheeky. Very cheeky.
preppers,fm89xp0,t3_ftpc4w,1585845535.0,"Thank you so much! Very helpful I didn't even think to check Etsy. Its basically for me and my sister. We're on our own right now and I have to go out because she is immune compromised. I'm not for now. We both had the big at 3 years old. Totally fine now. 

I really appreciate your reply. Thank you and stay safe!"
CoronavirusNJ,fm69w70,t1_fm5tt2i,1585789398.0,That's what I'm afraid of honestly. There's just something that doesn't feel right. And I'm not nearly prepared for those possibilities. I want to be. Bur good grief today was ridiculous and that was just for necessity.
CoronavirusNJ,fm4j542,t1_fm4gpl4,1585755129.0,"Completely empty as in supplies. Barely anyone at 6am. The ShopRite was like the bloody hunger games. The STOPNSHOP up tye road from me has been empty product wise for a while..and I know someone who works there. But hey, at least gas is at its lowest so I can travel around. Its just draining doing it for 3 other people as well."
CoronavirusNJ,fm42ygx,t1_fm41337,1585745152.0,You're kidding! Well now I'm going to have to reroute because my Stop & Shop is completely empty. And I've been out since 6 a.m. . I really appreciate the update and info you've been exceptionally helpful. Take care of yourself doll.✌
CoronavirusNJ,fm169y0,t1_fm155ql,1585672771.0,"Ah yes. You figured correct. I have to drive someone into Plainfield weekly and there are several shops, corner stores and even their large supermarkets most are fearful to enter other than the locals. Sad really. But it's where I found most of my remaining paper goods. 

Its pretty decent here (Edison/Colonia) but once travelling towards Clark or Westfield forget it. I really don't understand the hoarding mindset. I get panic, I panic all the time but...-sigh- Sorry for the ramble. Trapped inside and boredom..well better to chatter than become idle. One day at a time right?  Your replies are much appreciated especially the info. ✌"
CoronavirusNJ,fm14ito,t1_fm13tbp,1585671861.0,"No kidding? Id never think to have stopped there and I drive past all the time. Hey thanks!  

If your evdr in the area - Apparently the former ""Foodtown"" in Colonia is pretty well stocked as well. Everytime I've gone in there it was like stepping out of the Delorean into 1989. 
(And I digress.)  Thanks again!"
