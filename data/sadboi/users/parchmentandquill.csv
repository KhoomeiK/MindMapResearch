funny,fl0keho,t1_fkzmj07,1584709070.0,"I’d give you an actual, thorough answer, but clearly you’ve already made up your mind and decided that most homeschoolers are “nutters” and that, in your expert opinion, only a select few reasons could possibly be good enough to choose this educational method.

I could tell you that I offer my kids the choice to go to public school every year. That they attended a music school for homeschoolers for 4 years and three of them were involved in the All State choirs for the state, one ranking #1 for her age range. I could tell you that my daughter started college at 16. That my 15 year old will (hopefully) start in the fall. That my 11 year old competes on a chess team and plays first board and just right now logged into Zoom to join his engineering class because homeschooling doesn’t mean taking all one’s classes at home, and we can’t meet in person because of Covid-19. I could go on and on...

But you’ve already made up your mind to judge all homeschoolers under one umbrella. Not everyone has. So, I’ll share for them. And thank goodness I don’t have to ask your permission to do what’s best for my children."
