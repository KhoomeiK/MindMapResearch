Destroying gifts their friends gave. My sister's classmates and I contributed a lot of money to buy a blackberry bold 5 for her (it was new at the time and white, really pretty phone) and my dad threw it out of a car window on a highway on our way from church because she didn't come to the car quick enough so we could all go home.

Threatening a kid so much that they end up lying so they can get out of being questioned to tears only to be punished for what they didn't do.

Embarrassing your kids in public just so you can make it known that you ""control"" your children and their entire lives.

My sister and I don't talk to my father anymore because all he's been is abusive and controlling so we're better off without him. Our older brother on the other hand still sucks his warm teat."
leagueoflegends,fpcarcc,t1_fpc13pw,1588493550.0,"All I'm getting from this exchange is ignorance and entitlement. The BEE was made for people who've been playing for so long and had so much IP stocked with nothing to spend it on. When it got reworked to BE most people asked for a way to get rid of the excess because they owned every item that could be bought with IP. It's not profitable for Riot at all. It comes 3 times a year (start of season, MSI, and end of season). 

This should be general knowledge if you're someone who actually has crazy amounts of BE from playing for a long time. To say ""the patch notes are too long"" is why you don't even deserve the BEE. A little reading on EVERYTHING being released that patch, mind you not just balance changes, cant hurt you. 

Why should they make a button the shop for something that only happens 3 times a year and isn't even profitable to them? It's free cosmetics and you'll be an entitled brat if you think they should be begging you to come and get free stuff."
