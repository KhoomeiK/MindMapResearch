I recommend taking practical steps now. There’s probably lots of posts on here about things to do instead and I’m sure if you ask all of us would gladly share what we do. Here’s a few of my favorites 

* hug my dog and pet her for hours
* make a cup of tea
* FaceTime a friend 
* take a long hot shower 
* let myself cry
* write in my journal
