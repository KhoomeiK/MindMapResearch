And use https://armory3d.org/

Since it seamlessly integrates with Blender. And slowly scale your global collective up. Community driven but using opencollective we could for the first time also pay participators or contributers. It is basically a patreon.com for communities.

Together r/gamedev r/lightbulb and r/solarpunk we could build something awesome.
