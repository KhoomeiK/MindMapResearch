singapore,fmbu5q7,t1_fmbmf5d,1585933263.0,"The friends I had in mind when I posted this, I‚Äôm quite close to them, and for them the mindset is ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt not see my bf what, dating couples are an exception to this rule‚Äù so not really any rough patch reasons. 

But yeah, as you said if the couple has a legitimate reason for meeting up and has thought through it then at least it‚Äôs a bit more justified I suppose. But if they‚Äôre just meeting because ‚Äúhow can you expect me not to meet my bf?‚Äù then I feel like maybe they should reconsider."
singapore,fmbtqt2,t1_fmbozkn,1585933047.0,"That‚Äôs my thought. My husband and I are physical touch people and we did nearly a year of LDR back when we were dating so I definitely understand that feeling of needing to meet. But if I‚Äôm considering the community then I feel like it‚Äôs selfish to want to put yourself first. Imagine if every couple does that, then there‚Äôs still going to be a lot of movement in the community for potential spreading."
singapore,fmbjrjr,t3_fu8uo1,1585927754.0,"I have friends who are still making plans to meet their SO during this period sigh. Don‚Äôt know how to convince them, I just feel like it‚Äôs selfish to put your wants above the current situation."

AskReddit,fm6w294,t1_fm6mf01,1585804930.0,"I had two chickens when I was younger named Skinny and Fatty (this is what happens when you let children name pets). They were super close and would go everywhere together, and we would buy mealworms as special treats for them and watch them go crazy over them. Every night they flew into a tall tree to sleep. 

Sadly, one got eaten by a stray cat (we think) and the other became super depressed after that. Some time later the remaining one died of smoke inhalation when my house caught fire. 

I miss my chickens."

That way I can do it over as many times as I need and sometimes it helps with processing my emotions as well. I also write things down even if they‚Äôre really dark because it helps to get them out in whatever way I can. Would this work for you do you think?"

In uni though, way less pressure. I didn‚Äôt actually use my S/Us...too kiasu (what if I really need it in future but I‚Äôve already used all of them!?). What a waste. And now in NUS apparently you can just freely S/U like almost all your first year mods or something?? Jelly."
