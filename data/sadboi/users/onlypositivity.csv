Perhaps you mean public services? Those come about because maximization of social mobility and increased skill and wealth development is a core function of the state. For the same reason the state wants you to have more babies, it is also in the state's best interest that you be well-educated and have access to methods to improve your standard of living. This is a purely economic standpoint, and ignores things like ""pursuit of individual agency or freedom,"" which are often also goals of the state, but not always, using only capitalism as our descriptor (an authoritarian regime can be capitalist, for example).

Capitalism is not ""people doing mean things and the more mean they are the more capitalist it is."" Words have meanings.

The Democratic Party always has one overarching problem, and its the same problem that gives rise to cannibalistic leftist movements among college kids over and over - they lack an overarching narrative and a vision they can explain in simple terms.

This is bizarre to me, because they have a very clear vision of a liberal society that argues the government can enable social mobility and innovation, while letting market demand and taxation solve most problems that arise. Thats an easy message to carve into bite size chunks. Its an easy message that they can take back the concept of being *Patriotic Americans* from Republucans by running on.

If God is perfectly just, there can be no such thing as eternal damnation because punishment, by design, is temporary and corrective. Otherwise it isn't punishment, it's aimless torture, which is not just.

The Bible reads a lot better when Hell is not viewed as a literal place of eternal suffering, which it is also never described as. Instead, we get descriptions such as

> When Jesus heard him, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, “Truly I tell you, in no one[d] in Israel have I found such faith. 11 I tell you, many will come from east and west and will eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, 12 while the heirs of the kingdom will be *thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”* 

...which is clearly nowhere near the same thing.

To me, the idea of life as a tryout or test instead of life to be lived in joyous service to others is one of the biggest problems we have in morality. Jesus told us what we already should have known - we have failed to build a Godly world because we do not act in a Godly manner.

The belief that none are righteous, that you espouse below, I view as a corruption of Jesus's intent. Humanity is not worthless. If Humanity is divinely created, we *cannot be*. Instead, we need to understand that we are not God, that our instincts in action are likely wrong, and submit to an authority of peace and prosperity."
