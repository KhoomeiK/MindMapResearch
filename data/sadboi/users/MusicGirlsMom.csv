depression,fab624i,t3_e73bft,1575918295.0,"Saturday, I didn't end up cleaning that one spot but I did go out to the movies with my husband. First time I'd left home in a week.

Yesterday, I went with him to the grocery store.

Today I got some expense paperwork filed I was dreaded doing.

Not a lot, I know, but it's one thing a day."
depression,fa6avti,t3_e7trv9,1575822823.0,"""Why would you want to kill yourself? What did I do to make that happen?"" - My mom

She meant well, I know she did, but the biggest memory I have after a suicide attempt in college (a long time ago now) was how much time I had to spend making everyone else feel better. It wasn't about what was going on inside me, it was all about them. It was exhausting.

And people wonder why I'm an introvert."
depression,fa16kqs,t3_e7jenh,1575765414.0,"Check if her insurance had any sort of telehealth option like mdlive or amwell. PlushCare is one that saved my life, I called them and got Wellbutrin refilled the same day. It was seriously amazing."

Agoraphobia,f9z015r,t3_chknv3,1575736265.0,"Another vote for PlushCare here. From the time I set up the app, picked a doc, had my appointment, then got notice my prescription has been sent to my pharmacy of choice was all of 20 minutes.

She was a GP, though. She told me in my state they happen to have a psychiatrist you can see for other med check appointments and she referred me to him. They don't have one in all States, but they might in yours.

PlushCare takes my insurance (BCBS) so it cost me nothing by my regular copay."

Anyone else want to do just one thing?"
antidepressants,f9yiumv,t3_dmzsmx,1575729259.0,"I'm on day 4 here, feeling a bit of a high as well. It hasn't been long enough to be the actual drug taking hold, I think this is just the ""OMG I TOOK CONTROL"" high I get when I actually accomplish something I found to be difficult - like calling the doctor, asking for help, and being given validation that help is definitely needed."

antidepressants,f9ybcta,t3_e2x0sg,1575726284.0,"It takes more like 5-6 weeks before it really kicks in. That sucks, I know! I'm only on week 1 myself.
Give it time! But when in doubt, call your doc."
antidepressants,f9yahfi,t3_e417p8,1575725927.0,"I went through PlushCare, because my psychiatrist had disappeared (that's a post in itself!) and my regular doc said it would be a month before I could see her. Urgent Care can't give antidepressants, and in a month, I think I'd have been dead, so.... I started looking.

I thought it was a scam at first, like ""order meds from Canada without a prescription!!"" But I researched, read reviews in actual papers, read the BBB report, some actual user experiences, and checked with my insurance that this was something they accepted. They did. I finally figured what the fuck, it's this or death, so I set up the app.

Setting up the app, choosing the doctor/appointment time (there are hundreds of doctors in whatever state you're in), having the actual appointment, and receiving a text saying my prescription was called into the pharmacy I chose took 20 minutes. Seriously, 20 minutes. I could barely drive to my PCP in 20 minutes, nevermind the hour+ she's always running behind.

Since then, I've been doing more research for our daughter who's in college. We're moving to new insurance in January, and it turns it they have contacts with to two different telemedicine sites!

So choose carefully, do your research, know they're going to run you through the standard ""are you depressed"" questionnaire. If you've been on meds before, know what doses (if you can recall - I called my old pharmacy because I couldn't), and whether they worked for you (and if not, why not)

I had a list in front of me, and seriously, I could not have been happier. My husband picked up the meds on his way home. 20 minutes. At least that quickly it didn't give me a lot of time to change my mind!"
antidepressants,f9y7tcr,t3_e5bs4s,1575724795.0,"I had this exact issue. I'd been on 300mg Wellbutrin when my doc decided to add Zoloft 100mg. I did that for about 6 weeks, and while I lightened my mood, making me more likely to want to have sex, I was completely unable to orgasm, which was frustrating for both of us.

What I did is stop both meds and cycle down into a near-suicidal funk, so don't do that. Talk to your doctor. I finally found a new one and she put me back on Wellbutrin only (which actually raises my sex drive) then will think about adding something one that's settled in."
antidepressants,f9y5r0f,t3_e7cvv3,1575723822.0,"I can't help too much, as I just got back on Wellbutrin this week. I'm still vaping though, so all good there so far. I was on Wellbutrin for several years while I smoked refusal cigs though and there was no reaction.   

When in doubt, ask your doc of course :)"

depression,f9q4wwt,t1_f9pgyzc,1575555233.0,"Hi to both of you, I'm a Mom and I just wanted to chime in here because I think I had a similar reaction when my daughter told me she was depressed. It crushed me because as a Mom I want to fix everything for her, and depression isn't something I can fix. What helped me (and, I hope, her) was taking on the things I *could* do something about - she asked me to help her find a therapist and I did and took her there, when he suggested she try a certain light (we live somewhere without a lot of sun) I researched them and got her one, that sort of thing. So basically, what I'm saying is don't be afraid to ask your moms (or dads!) to help you with something, because most of us just don't know what to do!"
