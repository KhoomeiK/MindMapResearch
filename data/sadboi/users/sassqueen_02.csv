AskReddit,fpbqlhz,t1_fpbpour,1588476266.0,Okay so basically it's like having a super embarrassing moment. Like having something stuck in your teeth all day or tripping horribly in front of every one. It's not like these things happen every day but if it happens once (or the unlikely chance that it happens twice) you'll remember that moment enough to not want it to happen again.
AskReddit,fpboprw,t1_fpbnyuh,1588474948.0,"Thank you u/Space_Cranberry for the ultimate birth control. I will definitley not be getting pregnant any time soon. But I'm also a redditor so the chances of that happening are slim to none lol

AskReddit,fpaxeen,t1_fpaif9q,1588457699.0,"This is legit a real issue for me. Whenever I'm choking i blow it off as me just coughing or smth. But I think it has to do with my social anxiety and just not wanting attention drawn to myself. But now I'll be sure to hack it out next time. Dying in a bathroom stall seems like kind of a grim end for me lol

Edit: guys I promise I know how to chew food its just happened like maybe three times in my life. These moments are just etched in brain forever I guess. So no need to worry. I'm doing good :)"

I mean everyone has their own lifes to deal with and I'd hate for someone to feel like they have to talk to me in fear that I'm going to go off the deep end. I just want someone to talk to me because they care not because they're afraid I'm gonna hurt my self or something awful like that.
