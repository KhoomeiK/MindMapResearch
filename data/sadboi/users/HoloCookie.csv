Now the whole COVID-19 situation, I have to cancel my one year contract with my landlord because I am going back to my home country for who-knows-how-long.

I am certain that I will get higher than 55% in both of the courses but I won't get a high enough mark to bring up my GPA from last semester. Is it a good idea to choose Cr/D/F?

UBC,fg8t3vr,t3_exhucr,1580629296.0,Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us. We all have up and downs. Remember to take time to take care and love yourself. Assignments are just assignments. You probably won’t remember anything from an essay couple of years later. After all what really matters is your health and well-being. Drink some water and take a breath then start planing out your time to finish your assignments. It’s okay to miss one or two deadlines for some of the courses. I believe a majority of people studying here have missed one or two assignments. Stay positive and be easy on yourself ❤️

Take notes on paper in lecture: don’t copy the codes, instead, write down how and why a piece of code should be here.
Work through lecture starters as soon as lecture ends.
Start working on problem sets as early as possible.
Don’t rush through lab quizzes, those are important.
Go to office hours.
Practice as much as problems in the problem bank as possible.
Follow the recipe."

Try to think about other beautiful things in our lives. Memories and experiences are what truly matter. However I’m not saying that we shouldn’t try hard for the finals. One thing I think that’s really helpful is to trying to teach a friend. If you can explain how to solve a question clearly then you should have a fairly good understanding of the material. Also, it is cliche but practice makes perfect, go over more practice questions and take notes whenever you made a mistake and pay attention to avoid it. Good luck :)"
