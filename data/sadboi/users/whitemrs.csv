He didn‚Äôt want to hurt me so he kept it all for himself.. until he snapped... instead of talking about those issues with me he told me that it was all fine and I wasn‚Äôt aware about our problems even if I asked about some things multiple times. After one big fight he told me that he had enough and in fact he had some issues and problems with me (that he wasn‚Äôt really willing to share with me before). I tried to handle it correctly and I told him that.. all right. Now I know about them and I can do something about them. But.. he told me that he‚Äôs done and it‚Äôs too late. I fought for us for two months when he suddenly started acting like I didn‚Äôt mean anything. Just like this. I could stop existing. He became violent and hurtful. I tried to handle it with minimum dignity I had left in me just to save us as I knew that he was struggling with depression (freshly diagnosed) and tried to help him and support him even if he treated me like shit. Despite all the things I tried and I handled with patience he still treated me like trash.. it‚Äôs been a month since we hadn‚Äôt talked and he is sadly involving me in his financial problems. I‚Äôm barely handling what he had done to me mentally and now I am worried about my finances because he seems to not care about me at all. He is not interested about my mental health (he left me in pretty bad shape, I‚Äôve lost 10 kg in less than 2 months and had big issues with sleep but when I told him about it - he told me that he doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about it and he want to start fresh, without me).

Thank you for your comment. Of course I am considering therapy as it‚Äôs getting too hard for me to handle it all and I am really suicidal lately.
