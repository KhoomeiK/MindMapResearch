So? Sharing DNA doesn’t give them carte blanche to treat you however they want and you’re obligated to keep them in your life. 

If she adds additional and unnecessary stress to your life, tell her you need space. If you feel like you want to put effort into cultivating a better relationship with her, more power to you.  

It’s okay to say, “no” and have zero guilt attached to that.

I don’t get to feel sad, angry, whatever, because someone somewhere is experiencing it more intensely? You are allowed to feel pouty at the same time someone is devastated, and BOTH should be seen as valid responses. 

If you feel like therapy would help, get started. Ignoring your emotional pain doesn’t make someone else’s go away. 

In addition, it sounds like you judge yourself pretty harshly, and I do the same thing. A lot of this is because for an extended period of time I was stuck in a situation where appearances were everything, physical, emotional, intellectual; look a certain way, never show undesirable emotions, and always think about what you are going to say before you say it so you don’t embarrass yourself or others associated with you. 

I haven’t figured out how to get over this and STILL struggle with feeling like it’s okay to be, ya know, human. To make mistakes and realize the world won’t implode, that humanity doesn’t depend on how I look that day. In all honesty, I could definitely use some therapy since I feel like I have the emotional maturity and range of a robot.

Looking back on it now, I realize that the person I was in love with and wanted to marry didn’t exist. It was a version of himself that he wanted me to see. My guess is the ACTUAL person he was, started revealing himself after he thought I wouldn’t go anywhere a.k.a. because of the engagement. 

It hurt so bad and I second-guessed myself A LOT after I left. Now that the emotions are gone and I’ve moved on, I can see that I had stayed, I wouldn’t be with the man I loved, I would be with whoever he actually was after he stopped hiding everything.

The thing I discovered is there is no standard mourning time for what you lost. Many times I’ve heard people say this and it’s not a matter of “I should be over it by now” but rather “I want to be over it by now.” 

The one thing I wished I hadn’t done during the aftermath of it all was suppressing my feelings. It was one of the worst things I did when everything fell apart because it didn’t allow me to feel what I needed to in order to move on; feel angry, feel betrayed, feel sad, it’s okay to block out the world for a little bit in order to heal. I wasn’t smart enough at the time to do this and I found myself being stuck in a perpetual cycle of my sadness and anger rising to a boiling point and me trying to ignore it all and force it back down by sheer force of will. This made my mourning period last for years, so I don’t recommend following in my footsteps. 

I’m so sorry this happened. At times it was almost unbearable for me and I can reassure you that emotional meltdowns are completely okay if you feel the need to let it all out. 

Cliche as it is, time is your friend. (Just because it’s cliche doesn’t mean it’s not true.) You aren’t doomed to a lifetime of misery, although it probably feels like it right now. 

So, in a nutshell, it does get better. I’m in a healthy relationship now and we’ve been together for a long time. It did take me awhile to get to the point where I felt like I could trust someone again, so be patient with yourself. 

Best of luck!

 The thing that I find the hardest is growing up I’ve heard over and over, “you can do anything you set your mind to, nothing is impossible, you just need to try harder/practice more...” Mental issues aren’t like that, so when we try harder and and really focus on being better but nothing happens, your self worth shatters, even more so than before. This brought hopelessness into my life. If nothing will change based on the sage advice of social proverbs, then I give up. 

My view of the world completely changed because everything I’ve heard up to this point in my life applies to everyone else, and doesn’t apply to me. That means I must be irreversibly broken. 

I saw someone had commented that it’s more about not wanting to exist and I agree 100%. I actually talked to someone the other day and I described it as wanting to disappear.

My hang up was mental. Instead of being in the moment I’m wondering, how far does he want to go? If I initiated it, I’m wondering if he’s tired or maybe he doesn’t want to and is just going along with it, what pace does he want? Etc. Etc...

So I told him to be blunt about it. If he wants a blowjob after work, just ask. If he wants something more, tell me. If he’s too tired or not in the mood, let me know and it’s no big deal. In turn, I do the same to him. 

Granted, it’s not the sexiest suggestion because it does take away spontaneity, but I’m able to enjoy sex more because it allows me to get out of my own head and enjoy the present. It erases any doubt that he’s not enjoying it or doesn’t like this or that, because we’ve talked about it beforehand. 

We still have spontaneous moments, random make out sessions, and unplanned quickies so it’s not like I have a calendar scheduled out of future bedroom activities. 😂

askwomenadvice,esngzir,t3_c8fi70,1562132314.0,"First, my heart breaks for you, honey. I am so sorry that you had to endure anything like this. 

I’ve gone through something very similar. It was years ago, but I can still remember exactly how I felt during those times. I was in a long term relationship where I was the one with more experience so we started trying different things to see what he liked. Somewhere along the way it flipped to him making me do things I didn’t want to do, guilt tripping me, and I don’t really have another word for it, but blackmail seems to sum it up. 

Looking back I’m flabbergasted that I hung in for as long as I did - even now I can’t explain why I stayed. I swore I would never be in a disrespectful relationship, but it slowly seeps into you changing your idea of what is normal. 

But I do know now: THAT’S NOT LOVE. 

It took me a long time to trust anyone or emotionally invest in anything. I had a bunch of flings that only left me sad and unsatisfied, maybe I thought I could magically bang my way to happiness? I don’t know, I was dumb and had no direction in my life, clearly. Anyway you look at it, it wasn’t a fun time. 

I finally just started to ignore any romantic aspects and focused on what I wanted to do. If I wanted to work more hours, I’d do it. If I didn’t want to join friends on the weekend, I didn’t. I remember having an unexpected day off work and I decided a spur of the moment beach trip by myself was what I needed. I did things that were fun by my definition and turned off my “give a crap meter” regarding other people’s opinions. 

I wasn’t intimate with anyone for a long time. Anything past a kiss was out of the question. I never decided, “I’m going to start dating again.” I thought if it was going to happen, then it would happen. I didn’t want to force anything, I wasn’t in a timeline, and I was determined to be patient. 

There were lonely days, and lonely nights. I would get sad and even angry at times, all I knew for certain was that I didn’t want a repeat of the last few years and decided it was better to feel a little down than push myself into anything before I was ready. 

I did end up meeting people who actually cared about me as a person. Even if we were only friends, it allowed me to see that not all guys are the same, they don’t all react the same, and some can actually be protective and want what’s best for you. They’re out there, I promise - it may just take awhile to find them. 

You might need to take a different path than I did, but maybe something in here helped, even if it was knowing that you aren’t the only one who’s had these kind of feelings and frustrations. 

Please remember to be kind to yourself. His actions were not your fault. You did what you thought was best during the time this was happening to you. 

On the sexual side of things: I know it’s hard to believe, because I didn’t for the longest time, but there are guys out there that actually like making girls finish. Like, it turns them on because they were able to get you to cum. 

If you do start to date again and it gets to the point where you think things are about to get physical (sexually), stop things and tell him what’s going on. Boys will run away, but the men stay. (At least that’s been my experience) 

When you’re ready to get back into things, take it slow; maybe you need to be in charge of what happens in the bedroom the first couple of times. I know that being in control when I got back into an actual relationship built my confidence back up and helped me break out of the mindset that I’d never enjoy sex. 

Best of luck!

AskWomenOver30,escsw00,t3_c6vko1,1561838011.0,"We have talked about it being medical, but it was a little weird because he seemed really eager during our initial conversation to see if that was the problem and make an appointment with his doctor, but he hasn’t yet. Now when I ask him about it he always says it’s on his list to do, or he’ll get around to it. 

I love my husband and want to get through this. For me, sex is an important part of my life and and even more so when it comes to our marriage. 


Right now I’m just frustrated. Thank you for your suggestions!"
askwomenadvice,escs0gv,t1_escprqm,1561837364.0,"Thank you for your perspective! I hadn’t thought about him being afraid of another pregnancy; that’s an AH-HA! moment for me. 

I’ve tried making sex all about him (I gave him oral without expecting reciprocation 5 times last week), but all your other suggestions will help me think about what else he might like. 

I know it’s hard to convey tone over text, so seriously, thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to read my post."
AskWomenOver30,esck1n2,t3_c6vko1,1561831400.0,"Last week, but before that a year and a half, and then before that ONE event, another year. I feel like people my age (32) are out there having great sex, or at least sex at regular intervals. I can’t help but think about what I’m missing all the time.  

My husband and I have been together for 11 years, married for 8. Things started out regularly, like most new relationships do, and then slowly went down. About 3 years ago it stopped. Do not pass GO, do not collect $200. Not by my choice, mind you. 

We finally broke our year and a half dry spell last week but only he finished receiving oral. I’ve tried other times this last week to initiate something using oral because of his response to it, but as soon as I climb on top he’s completely lost wood; I mean ENTIRELY, and this would be within seconds. I’m so frustrated."

depression,esaid0v,t3_c6k74k,1561760320.0,"All the YES to this post. I’ve done this since middle school. I just stopped talking because I felt like I had nothing to say, or at least nothing that someone else was interested in. So I made a rule that I don’t talk to anyone unless they talk to me first. Like a type of “permission” given to me so that I don’t embarrass myself and have to avoid them for the rest of my life. 

I didn’t think anyone else felt like this."

depression,es8h6xi,t1_es8g8oq,1561697800.0,"It wasn’t my intention to imply infidelity, I was only trying to use that as my experience for feeling unwanted, etc. My ex-fiancée was my first serious relationship, as well. 

I wish I had some magic advice for you because even though I don’t know you, I remember that feeling. I don’t wish it in anybody."
depression,es8gta3,t1_es8e1nx,1561697410.0,"I totally get what you’re saying. My bad for not conveying that in my initial comment. It’s hard to get the desired tone over text sometimes. 

And I’ll agree with you again: I think there are expectations from both men and women about what to find attractive. I’m sorry you have had bad experiences with this. I feel ya.

depression,es8f480,t3_c6f9c2,1561695790.0,"I’ve been there. I had to end a long engagement because he was unfaithful. I understand not feeling wanted, needed, all those things. I don’t really have any advice, but know that you have someone to commiserate with. 

Not sure that this will help, but from my standpoint you shouldn’t feel bad or less manly for being sad or needing to cry. Everyone experiences emotion and every emotion is on a spectrum. Just because it sounds like you’re a guy on the intense side of the sadness spectrum, doesn’t make you less valid. It sounds like there’s a lot going on in your life and you’re dealing with it how you can given your circumstances. 

Anywho...rant over. Maybe you found something in here to help? If not, my bad."

depression,es8d6tl,t1_es6ws9v,1561694065.0,"I love this point of view. Your comment really made me think. 

When did trying to suppress someone’s emotions become a comforting tactic? Why do people do this? Just someone being there is comfort. Actually, that’s the simpler option of the two. No one should need to worry about finding “the right words” when just showing up makes way more of an impact."
depression,es8cks0,t1_es6oy5m,1561693545.0,"I don’t understand this expectation that men are only supposed to express “manly” emotions like rage, confidence, and such; but not sorrow, regret, etc. 

Dudes aren’t robots. There are no “good” or “bad” emotions, they’re just emotions. I wish more people understood this. I’ve been with guys that were robot-like and they all ended up being assholes, or a cheater, or whatever. 

I don’t trust guys that pretend nothing phases them. Keep being yourself. I’m not saying be a Mt. Vesuvius of emotion the first time you meet someone, but guys shouldn’t feel judged for being human. 

Okay. Rant over. Sorry about that...😐"

depression,es209f4,t3_buq56r,1561510492.0,"More people need to understand the difference between the two. Sadness is an emotion that everyone experiences, but that feeling eventually fades and get replaced with another. Depression is the perpetual feeling of everything described in the OP. 

The analogy I’ve heard and I like the best is: telling a depressive person there’s lots to be happy about is like telling an asthmatic they should never have trouble breathing because there’s plenty of air. It’s something the body cannot do (in most cases) on its own. More people need to understand this. 

Bottom line: we shouldn’t have to prove the severity or existence of our diagnosis."
