Other than that, they have a decent amount of power as long as you don't let your grass grow too high, otherwise it'll struggle a bit, but really that's with most mowers, gas or electric.  For a small yard though, they're more than adequate.  If I had a lot less grass to cut, I'd buy one again."

Life just wouldn't be worth living any more.  I just know I could not survive that kind of a loss.  My heart goes out to you.  That little angel's life was cut too short.  I'll never understand why things like that happen in this world."
GriefSupport,flj2cwp,t3_fp0fmt,1585196857.0,"One thing I can tell you is that at first, and probably for a while you'll be in a state of despair.  When I lost my dad to cancer 2 and a half years ago after a short 5 month battle, I was devastated.  The once strong man who was fearless and one of the toughest men I never knew, withered away to nothing and I had to watch it.  Powerless.  Helpless.  

After his death, I fell apart.  I sank into a deep state of depression.  My panic attacks and anxiety came back full force and I lost my job.  I was out of work for about a year.  It took me a while to pick up the pieces of my shattered heart.  The only thing that saved me was my first born child, my beautiful daughter.  I have a son on the way too.  

I have a family now.  Something he always wanted for me.  Although I still think about him every day, and I still miss him just as much as the day I lost him, life has gotten back to normal.  But it's a different normal.  It's a world without my dad.  I'm happy, but I'm not as happy as I could be if he were here.  I'll never reach that level of happiness ever again.  I'll never be the same again.  I've become more independent, more fearless, stronger, because I no longer have him to turn to for advice.  I no longer have him to teach me things, I have to figure them out on my own and I'm doing pretty damn good.

Always find ways to honor her memory.  Keep your love for her alive.  Remember that she brought you into this world and gave you a life.  You're going to miss her more than you could ever know, and it's going to hurt like nothing has ever hurt before.  Eventually, when you're ready, life will go on.  Stay strong, friend.  Sorry you're going through this."

It's your mind's way of sort of taking a step back from reality to help you cope when you've experienced or are experiencing something traumatic.  However, I for one, find that feeling very distressing.  It took a while to feel somewhat normal again after my dad's death.  It was horrible.
