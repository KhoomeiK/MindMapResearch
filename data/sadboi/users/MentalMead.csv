I'll be honest though this is pointless you can search for a meaning in theory it's a good distraction and it'll probably help. The reality is that you need to have something to look forward to, something to be afraid of and something to give you the strength to fight what you fear."

My cousin was an infj and we were best friends all growing up and we would spend so much time together, riding bike around town and just talking. We would literally stay up all night just talking about random stuff. I was the leader like we decided I was the leader lol, I'd usually come up with plans on what we were gonna do and we'd just go. If it was raining we'd go and play sinking ship or submarine and we'd cast spells or become werewolfs lmao.
    
In terms of relationships I wanna be clear I'm pretty traumatized because I had amazing relationships but equally shitty breakups. Both of the girls I dated in highschool dropped out after I broke up with them üòìüò≠ and me and my first girlfriend dated from 1st grade into 7th grade and then she left me because she had to move. 
    
I found out that my school left the upper balcony unlocked in 11th grade and I used to just hide up there when I'd get sick of class lol I found out when drama practiced and then I'd bring my girlfriend up there occasionally. It was to dark for them to see us but it was still kinda hard because her parents watched her attendance. 
    
I used to sneak out with this one girl all the time we would ride our bikes across town and flirt back and forth but nothing ever happened. She was an Intp and we ended up being really bad for each other but one time we snuck into a closed donut store stole some donuts and were riding back home then ended up running from the cops and hiding in a treehouse. We drew some pictures in there and made it home safe. 
    
I used to have a really big truck with a straight axle all lifted and big tires lol it was fun but I used to take my girlfriend out at night and we could watch the stars from the trunk with a full-size mattress in the back x) it was pretty nice. 
    
Went out tubing with the family one time and it started raining while my family all got out of the water afraid of lightning we snuck off and just danced in the rain for a while. üòÅ Then the sun came out like a ray of hope. 
    
One time walking down a bike trail I decided that we were gonna turn off the trail and in my defense I said maybe we'll run into an old settlement and find some cool stuff then we actually did. There was the remains of a stone house in an open patch out in the middle of nowhere out in the woods.

From my understanding feelings categorically are very wide and then emotions are more direct caused by repetitive feelings and become part of our subconscious mind.
