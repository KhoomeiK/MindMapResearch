Our cat started pooping after the other cat died and we would leave him home alone. We think he had some form of anxiety towards being alone. He went an a whole year pooping almost every day in different rooms of the house. After we started this system, he’s only pooped once and that’s because my mom forgot to give him the composure one morning. 

Let me know if you have any questions! And good luck!"

dechonkers,f9pftlk,t1_f9p24d6,1575533858.0,"My cat used to poop on the floor daily and we completely cured him of it! Here’s what we did:

Two things: we give him a special treat called “composure” by VetriScience with every meal. It has special mix to help with stress and calms cats down. And if he’s acting up that day, we will give him an extra one, just to keep the mood chill. But no more than three a day. 

The second thing is smell. We have a plug-in by Comfort Zone that releases a calming smell. You put that in the room he spends the most time in to get the full calming effect. We also have just a spray by Comfort Zone that we use in his favorite pooping spots. The spray makes the room undesirable to the cat to poop. 

Everything is available from Chewy! It has been three months since he has pooped outside the litter box on this system. It works super well!

Also on days we know things will be particularly stressful we will spray a little extra of the spray. Just to keep things calm.

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know! Shoot me a message, I’m on here at least once a day! Our vet said that what happens is that sometimes cats poop outside of a litter box to prove a point for a while or because of how they feel but they can then become stuck in this habit. This will help break the cycle!

Hope this helps!

Also side note: they really shouldn’t play with yarn because they can eat it then it gets tangled inside or stuck. It’s dangerous."
