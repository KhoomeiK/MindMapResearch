SuicideWatch,fqrcv9t,t1_fqpm9zw,1589581875.0,"I worded it a bit dumb, for me it was like I was the bass, too stupid to see what my isolation and lack of interests do to me when it mattered and when I could do something about it. Now I'm in the trench and even if I wanted to get up it wouldn't be possible, I'm just in too deep. I think a lot of depressed people feel like this.

I dunno, maybe my stupid metaphor is just bullshit, sorry to waste your time."
SuicideWatch,fqp6ui2,t1_fqoubyi,1589537119.0,"I remember I tried some online chat-service to help deoressed people, took about three weeks to get an answer.

Makes one feel really small and insignificant."
SuicideWatch,fqp03gl,t1_fqor1xd,1589530298.0,"I once saw a documentary about reef fish, one bass swam away from the reef into a trench. The deeper it got into the trench the less oxygen there was in the water until the bass was doomed.

Sometimes I think we're like that bass, but we are unlucky enough to feel emotions during our futile struggle to breathe again one day."
SuicideWatch,fqoq4mt,t3_gjvy31,1589521623.0,"I guess people do so to deny the misery of the world around them, it's easier that way I think. And some people like us seem to can't stop thinking about the things that make life truly terrifying, at least it's like that for me. My brain just focusses on the misery because there is not really much else for me to think about.

Most of us don't because we have little good in our life, sometimes I think we're like those animals in documentaries that just die because they weren't fit for nature.
A bit of ignorance might be necessary to live life."

Same here my friend, makes me wonder sometimes if there was a cosmic reason I wasn't breathing when I was born and modern medicine just interrupted..."
SuicideWatch,fqd98lo,t3_gi3bbc,1589283846.0,"Fuck that guy, it's not your fault that he's a complete asswipe.

As other here have pointed out, people get ruthless behind a screen, they know that they can't be harmed and try how far they can go. I had two ""friends"" who always made their move on depressed girls, getting with them when they where at their lowest. Funnily enough both of them are now depressed themselves and I think one of them is in the psychiatry."
SuicideWatch,fqd0kg8,t3_gi4r8h,1589275435.0,"I got both an addiction to caffeine and weed, combined with lots of trauma. You're not alone man, the paranoia gets me too. I often wish I could just roll i to a ball on the floor and stop living there and then.

The reason I haven't killed myself is that some tiny part of me still hopes to find a part of this nice world. Or at the very least that there comes a reason to put up with this world's bullshit."
SuicideWatch,fqcw0wo,t3_ghw4lx,1589270853.0,"Yeah, my parents always where pissed when I was depressed and wanted to talk to them about my misery. Telling me that there is no reason to be depressed at 24 because being bullied all my life and getting a disability the moment I turn adult, preventing me from achieving the one goal I had is no reason to be depressed.


I'm sure they will be devastated and cry and shit when I kill myself, telling everyone I was deoressed and they didn't notice or some shit. I hate life so fucking much."
SuicideWatch,fdl0xuw,t3_elu4me,1578515120.0,"I know this weird feeling of tumbling down, my friend. Just know that you are important as well and if the people you try to please don't hear you out or treat you bad when you get a little awkward then they aren't worth the trouble.


I mean I am the one to talk as a wreck with daily suicidal thoughts, I feel a bit hyhypocriticalBut as long as you are knowing that these thoughts are not good and you want them to stop you are on the right track, giving in is the worst you can do. Today I had to give in to the urge to bang my head against a wall, and despite my head longing for it to happen it felt really shitty and I felt really shitty afterwards. I think it is similar with suicide, your head wants to make something shitty look really good when in reality you will regret it(technically not sonce you are dead and don't have any thoughts anymore, but you get what I mean)"
SuicideWatch,fdk60xg,t3_elj38e,1578496874.0,"That's fucked up, man! I mean what your dad did. I.often cringe hard when I see photos or videos of me, if my dad thit this kind of shit I would be devastated.


Just know that you are not in the wrong, we all have a right to look crunched if we need to. Your dad is probably from a generation where it was shunned to show any sign of weakness, as you said it is probably hia fucked up was of trying to motivate you.


I have long since accepted that parents can be really retarded from time to time, just ignore that shit until you can leave them."
