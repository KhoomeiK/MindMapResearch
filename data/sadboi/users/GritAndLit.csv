Also, high divorce rates are misleading because they are highly raced and classed in the US.

I think romantic breakups have been sold to us in a neat, normative package: always a big REASON, always something WRONG for a breakup.

We put a lot of pressure on romantic relationships to end with a bang - but the fact is, not all relationships, romantic or otherwise, do end like that.

I have previous experience working with teens experiencing homelessness. So now I've started thinking that working in child welfare (not as an investigator but as a child welfare specialist) could be a good fit - busy schedule (which I really want), get to work with kids and families, potentially preventing some kids from experiencing homelessness down the line, and entering into lives at a really high-impact point. Plus, experience in the child welfare field seems like it could be helpful for any other roles I pursue later on outside of child welfare.

nonprofit,f6sisfv,t3_dsu91z,1573134826.0,"Sounds awesome! I am not sure where you‚Äôre from, but in the US there are a lot of universities with strong international programs, many of which require 1-2 years abroad (and fund it!). If you can land one of those scholarships, that could also be a great way to get a really targeted education and be abroad, then you could move abroad after graduation, perhaps via a fellowship (peace corps, global health corps, etc) or with the help of one of your contacts from when you were abroad. 

I second what everyone else is saying about volunteering and interning while you‚Äôre in school. Even if the experience isn‚Äôt specifically global, getting experience in that you could apply in a global context is a must. So for example I don‚Äôt know a lot about human trafficking, but for HIV/AIDS work nonprofits abroad often want experience working in that arena, even if it‚Äôs at a domestic-serving nonprofit. 

Also, depending on what exactly you want to do, consider pairing your international studies degree with a second degree which will help narrow your skill set. I had friends in college who did international studies and public health, urban planning, or languages. I‚Äôm in an MSW program now and also think a social work degree could  be a good pairing. 

Finally, consider alternatives to getting a full adult job in a nonprofit if something doesn‚Äôt work out. Most commonly I‚Äôve seen people able to move to a new country without a job because they are getting a graduate degree (sometimes through Fulbright or Rotary) or through other fellowships. It can be really hard to get a full job in another country if you don‚Äôt have a contact (and especially if you don‚Äôt speak the language fluently), so keep some options in your back pocket."

TwoXSex,f6eiq6d,t3_dr2hdt,1572804546.0,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable but it does sound like it‚Äôs getting in the way of living your life, which I‚Äôd argue is why most people eventually do see a therapist for things like anxiety and depression. 

An example: I have performance anxiety and it always helped me feel prepared before a big exam or a play. But I also sunk literally dozens of hours researching and practicing and studying, to the point that I was unable to have a normal personal life, and it eroded my mental health. I felt out of control. I eventually went to see a therapist and it helped a LOT. I still study, prepare, and practice, but now I don‚Äôt miss out on time with friends, family and my SO. 

So TL;DR - Most people‚Äôs anxiety does work for them in some way, and yours is helping you feel safe and protected from a very real and scary problem. But it shouldn‚Äôt be taking over your life like this! I‚Äôd see a therapist (maybe even a sex therapist) and have a frank convo with your OBGYN."

personalfinance,f0nra65,t1_f0nfzbx,1568778124.0,"Part of what is explained on the thread is that a lot of poverty is contextual and geographic. I‚Äôve spent the last four months counseling people on their financial goals at a nonprofit. I‚Äôm also an MSW student. I‚Äôve learned a lot, and I hope some of this is clarifying. 

Lots of budgeting tips and tricks involve things like buying groceries in bulk or buying at speciality stores. That can be EXTREMELY difficult if you‚Äôre already poor and you live in a food desert. 

Once you‚Äôre behind - and I mean behind in every sense (as suggested by the thread, check out generational poverty), it‚Äôs hard to catch up. 

Hard often becomes impossible because systems (in America) are built in a way that keeps certain people in poverty. From bus routes to payday loans to check-cashing services and even bank locations, there are lots of systems and institutions that make it really hard for people to escape poverty, intentionally or not. 

For info on the way the brain is impacted by poverty, I love this article: [This is Your Stressed Out Brain On Scarcity (NPR)](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/07/14/330434597/this-is-your-stressed-out-brain-on-scarcity) 

I know that was long, but I think we judge people really harshly when we forget to acknowledge what has made it possible for us to escape poverty or never experience it, and consider how and why those things might not be available to other folks.  I can‚Äôt distill every piece of literature on poverty, but encourage anyone curious to read up (and volunteer your formidable personal finance services, if you‚Äôre so inclined)."

psychotherapy,f062f1c,t1_f054lne,1568426972.0,"Dunno if this is allowed, but the NYT paywall is the bane of my existence so:

‚ÄúHarvard Medical School sends out an email when an esteemed faculty member passes away, and more often than not I delete it without clicking. I feel shame for not taking the time to read about the death of colleague whose life was devoted to medicine or science, but I do think about death a lot for someone my age ‚Äî perhaps too much.

As a Stage 4 kidney cancer patient at age 35, I ruminate more about legacy than I‚Äôd like. When I have encouraging follow up scans, as I did this month, the topic becomes less urgent, but I never stop wondering about the aftermath of my looming death ‚Äî whether it will be this year, five years from now, or some fantastical version of later life that I am capable of imagining only on my most aspirational days.

I was a mere assistant professor of psychiatry when I learned that the statistical odds were that I‚Äôd most likely die before my career had a chance to take off. Would anyone care about the 20 or so academic publications I poured my heart and mind into these last five years? I always imagined that I would have the next 30 to contribute something of lasting value. Knowing what I do now, I sometimes wonder if that time and energy should have been spent in other ways.

My ruminations become more intense when they transition to what I might leave behind in my personal and family life. Which of my older family members will have to endure the cruel task of attending my funeral? Will my wife be able to find happiness while being a widow who lovingly raises our little boy? He‚Äôs only 2 years old now. Will he even remember me when this is all over?

I entered therapy a year ago, shortly after having the first of my surgeries, which was aiming to be curative. But it turned out that the cancer had spread, and is now an incurable disease.

Being in therapy as a psychiatrist is an odd experience, a bit like Peter Pan chasing his shadow. I know how I‚Äôd respond to someone like me. Sometimes it aligns with how my therapist reacts and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt.

We have not come to any invaluable revelations or insights about my so-called ‚Äúadjustment disorder with depressive and anxious features.‚Äù (This is a fairly flexible diagnosis code that psychiatrists tend to use when a patient has good reasons to feel sad and worried.)

But the ways that the therapy has been useful have surprised me and remind me of a lesson from one of my early mentors: At the end of therapy, you may ask your patient what they found most helpful, and it will turn out to be the furthest thing from your mind. All of your most clever therapeutic interpretations may go over the patients‚Äô heads, but they will always feel the benefit if you care about them.

As a trainee, it seemed hokey. As a man who is desperate just to exist, it makes all the sense in the world.
Sometimes, though, I worry that all the time and mental energy I spend in those therapy sessions will be lost to the vapors of the universe when my story ends.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs strange,‚Äù I said to my therapist. ‚ÄúThere are people in my life who know me extraordinarily well. My parents. My brother. My wife. My closest friends. And then there‚Äôs you.‚Äù

He nodded.

‚ÄúOver the last year, you‚Äôve gained access to parts of me that no one else has, and I‚Äôm afraid that when I die, those parts of me will disappear, too.‚Äù


He paused and looked away, searching for the words he wanted to say. He looked back up and made eye contact with me. Tears were just beginning to well up.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never forget you, Adam.‚Äù

There was nothing profound about his words, but without my knowing it, his response was exactly what I sought in that moment and more notably how I needed to receive it, offered with a genuine sense that he truly cared about me.

The idea of what talk therapy is has evolved, but how people connect will always be at the very core of why it helps. For as long as I live, I‚Äôll never forget that moment, and my sense is that I have one less rumination clouding my mind during these invaluable months when my body still feels alive.‚Äù"

I‚Äôd be interested in any research into this phenomenon - is it pop culture? The age of the name (i.e. naming after grandparents)? 

For example, I‚Äôm not having kids any time soon, but I have been surprised at how popular Amelia has gotten - when I was growing up and fell in love with the name, no one I knew had it. But for some reason other people who are my age also have a particular affinity for it, so much so that it‚Äôs one of the top girls names in the US. Why is that?"
