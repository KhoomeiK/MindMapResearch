2XChromosones,f9fial9,t3_e4tl8j,1575273031.0,"Soooo many of us have had abortions. I had an abortion as a single woman. I had what turned out to be a one night stand during grad school. I knew I wanted children but could not imagine taking on being a single mother. It was early in the pregnancy. I went to a clinic in Boston where the doctor was THE KINDEST doctor I have ever met. My memory is of his taking my hand leading me in with the nurse. Hard to imagine his actually doing that but I‚Äôm saying that he cared for and about me. 
In my thinking about having an abortion I  believe or many would say, rationalize, that that soul was not ready to come into the world, could come back into the world as another‚Äôs child, or could come into the world as one of my children. It was too early to know anything about what the child would be. But I think of it as a girl and gave it a name. 
I have never regretted it. I am thankful that I could get an abortion legally. Am thankful to a dear friend who took me. 
Most of all I remember with gratitude having met a doctor that was so compassionate. And yes this was at Crittenton House in Brighton, where later there was anti-abortion violence. 
Best wishes to you!!!"
