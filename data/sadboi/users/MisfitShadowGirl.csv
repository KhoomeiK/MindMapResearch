runaway,fqza8up,t1_fql5zui,1589763147.0,"Everything depends on the person, but some people get even angrier if you don’t fight back. I suffered two very different types of abuse- my dad didn’t like us talking back, but my mom loved it. She wanted a fight and if you refused to give her one it resulted in physical abuse rather than verbal.
I think whatever type of abuser OP is dealing with they’ve probably gained enough experience to know what to say or do in an abusive event. Most kids learn unconsciously how to manipulate their manipulator."
runaway,fqz9tfn,t1_fqm47p2,1589762892.0,I agree- I’ve tried talking to mine and it resulted in a lot of gaslighting and even worse abuse.
runaway,fqidwr2,t3_git59o,1589394699.0,"It sounds like you tried to do this legally and safely several times with no success. it happens to a lot of people, especially with this new stereotype of kids hating their parents for no reason. I'm not at all against running away- a lot of people do it just to get away from their lives, even when they aren't in danger. However, you clearly are, which makes it very important that you are very thorough about all this. 

If you have any hope left in other solutions, I recommend you run to another state, (or even just a farther city in your state) and contact officials from there. they are more likely to listen without bias. Make descriptive journal entries of every act of abuse, and take pictures of any injuries they inflicted. Evidence always helps.

if all else fails, you can use the hundreds of resources on this sub to plan out your runaway. ask questions, read the articles, and prepare yourself. some are willing to walk you through the planning process.

good luck"

I do not have a line art/black and white rate, but my sketches are priced at $5 per panel, background not included.

Fully colored panels are generally $10 with my pricing, but that can go up or down at times, depending on what I'm drawing.

I should mention that to successfully work together on this, there has to be a lot of description and communication. You will need to give me either very detailed descriptions of what you would like drawn or some sort of reference or sketch you have on hand (even stick figures are better than nothing). I don't have the story in my mind, so a lot of communication goes into transferring your plan into my illustrations.

runaway,fk69jzv,t3_fgpv1z,1583896613.0,"Yes, a lot of adults aren't accepting of different gender roles or mental disorders, but that doesn't make it ok for them to disrespect your needs. I would try to seek medical help, maybe report the abuse. But running away isn't always the safest choice. Remember to look through every option before you make your decision. If this is who you are, then it's not ""rebellious."" It's just your guardians refusing to acknowledge and respect you. You can talk to trusted family or close friends about the situation, but if you are in immediate danger or getting kicked out, call the police or a hotline. If you do decide to run away, check out some of the other resources here and feel free to ask more specific questions as you think of them.

Good luck!"

My only critique is remember that even when your legs are folded, the knees are a bit square rather than pointed. Other than that your proportions look great!"

I spend a lot of my time just in my head jumping around these little imaginary worlds, creating stories and all that good stuff. Even if it's not an actual condition, it's still a good way for me to feel less stressed and safe. If you can sink into your imagination for a bit you might feel a little better, even if it's a temporary fix"

I get so freaked out. Sometimes I'll be thinking about something and I instantly panic because what if someone else can ""hear"" me?
It's completely irrational and I honestly hate that I don't even feel safe thinking things in my own head."

runaway,fd9bzj9,t1_fd7tfu6,1578231302.0,"I think it depends on where you are and how far if it from where you are going. I'm not sure what the weather is like in Oklahoma. If it's cold in the winter, don't leave in the winter. If it's scorching is the summer, don't leave in the summer. Check the weather on where you go so you can plan ahead on when you should leave and when you should arrive."
runaway,fd9b566,t3_ek9a1h,1578231016.0,"I brought my dog with me on my first run, so this is all based on my experience. Let me tell you, dog food is expensive, and medications are even worse. That being said, it's completely ok to bring your dog as long as your prepped to handle her.

I suggest that your dog eats what you eat, so know that you'll need food for two whenever you get hungry. A lot of people think it's a myth, but a ton of places throw day old food in the dumpster and some will give it to you if you ask before they throw it. Of course never go inside to ask but if you wait until they go out to toss it you could win a free meal. When you do have to buy food, aim for healthy and filling. Fruits and veggies and your best friend. I can promise you right now that's brand and store makes zero difference. Buy whatever is cheapest, and keep an eye on how much of it you get. You want to get enough food but if it's a perishable then make sure you can eat it all 
Before it goes bad.


If you can get vaccines for your dog before you leave it would be much better. My dog got a three year for almost all his first vaccines but I think there might be longer time periods. I can't imagine any other way for you to get her vaccines since you're under 18. Flea and tick is just something you'll have to go without unless you are willing to spend $60 every three months. You might be able to get a 12-month collar for it before you leave but that's it. I hate to say it but heart worm meds would be out of the question too. 

As much as waiting might hurt, you should absolutely train your puppy before you leave. I made that mistake the first time I tried to leave. My dog is little and cute but he doesn't listen to anything. He barked when I was trying to be quiet, he tried to pull on the leash when I needed him to stay close, and I had this constant anxiety about him getting attacked or hurt or starving. Of course, I went home for other reasons, but I knew I couldn't run with an untrained dog. 
Don't let any of that stop you from bringing your dog, all I'm saying it be prepared. Your dog HAS to be able to sit, stay, come, and be quiet without fail. Additional tricks can score you cash or free food from dog lovers on the streets. If you have a big or medium dog I would recommend training her to attack. This isn't only for your safety but also hers. Follow is also a good command if you ever take her off leash, but I wouldn't recommend doing that. The Internet can give you all the instructions of dog training.

You don't need much when you bring a dog. A short list is leash, collar with a dog tag (maybe with your email engraved instead of your address or your parents' phone number), collapsible bowl, and their favorite toy if it's not too big. I wouldn't recommend a stuffed animal; it won't last long. 

When you sleep I suggest you tie your dog to yourself. If someone gets near you your dog will wake up and it's more likely that you will feel her moving through the leash. Dogs generally won't care if they lay under your blanket or not, so don't stress about where she sleeps.

That's all I have for the dog portion. What you'll need it a whole other can of worms. I strongly recommend you check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/ceegp5/if_youre_new_and_need_advice_start_by_reading_this/?st=K511W9N3&sh=f76bf783). It covers almost everything. Aside from that all I would add is bring pepper spray and be prepared to act ten years older than you are. Look up prices and make calculations to figure out how much money you will have to make on the run to feed yourself and your puppy. Practice fasting before you leave so you get used to being a little hungry. I got down to the point where I only need one full meal and a snack later on. Water is everything. Never get dehydrated. Public water fountains are everywhere. I use a one liter plastic bottle and it weighs next to nothing when it's empty. A bar of soap works for hair and body wash. You can snag more at public restrooms. I cut my hair short after I ran. I did it myself and if looked fine and was twenty time easier to handle. 

Sorry if I went long. Feel free to ask me any questions. Good luck to you and your puppy.
