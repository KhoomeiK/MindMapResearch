schizophrenia,fk5os6x,t1_fk431rn,1583884903.0,Weird that you couldn't socialize with other patients..?
schizophrenia,fk3fcjn,t1_fk1vlly,1583830758.0,"Idk I talked to my psychologist and asked,  if I take antidepressants, is it fake happiness? She said no and that if you break your arm or have diabetes or whatever and take medication it's the same deal. You shouldn't be embarrassed by any means and your family should support you. There are options for insurance (I'm on Medicare and Medicaid)."
schizophrenia,fk3eyag,t1_fk30h9z,1583830200.0,Mutual. That's probably why I miss the hospital and my rehabilitation center or whatever it's called sometimes.
schizophrenia,fk3eki8,t1_fk2y4t1,1583829656.0,Classic.
schizophrenia,fk38qli,t1_fk377mm,1583822014.0,I completely agree. Lesson learned
eyedea,fk363z3,t3_fdi58g,1583819078.0,Not a song but an interesting philosophy. (I'm late to the convo) https://youtu.be/FCIiPH6IpPQ
schizophrenia,fk34zcx,t3_fg7qfv,1583817928.0,Definitely. I think that my hallucinations manifest somewhere in my subconscious like my dreams do. Interesting concept.
schizophrenia,fk34nk0,t3_fg7nt6,1583817606.0,"Eek. I stopped taking my geodon during the day and I always had this 'electrical shock' feeling in my brain (idk how to describe it). But I didn't want to take it during the day because it made me tired. Then, while drinking heavily, I stopped taking it all together and my withdrawals (prob from alcohol and geodon) caused me to have a panic attack and I had to go to the hospital. Idk my psychiatrist always said that once you're feeling good and you think you don't need meds, you do and you can relapse. Take care ☺️"

schizophrenia,fk2inas,t1_fk2gaf2,1583801890.0,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest? Idk if I like Dogma overall but I love this quote: Oraganized religion destroys who we are by inhibiting our actions, by inhibiting our decisions out of fear that some intangible parent figure, who shakes a finger at us from thousands of years ago and says, 'Do it..do it and I'll f-ing spank you'."
schizophrenia,fk2g13n,t3_fg4oi6,1583800237.0,That is awesome af. I wish I was artistic. I loved Joker and Joaquin Phoenix's performance in it. Is the first one Good Will Hunting?
schizophrenia,fk2fekv,t3_fg0jej,1583799841.0,"I would say around night time when we would drink tea and listen to music. I had my sister burn some CDs for me and the nurse let me play them for everyone. Also, activity time where I would shoot pool for an hour or so. Mornings were nice too because we got coffee and I read a lot. Someone else mentioned that it felt like a safe environment, and I second that."
schizophrenia,fjzwbse,t3_ffp9en,1583731623.0,That's sick!!
schizophrenia,fjzu7lf,t3_ffoecd,1583729544.0,"I find that if I make it a habit to go out in public or outside each day, it helps me not be so delusional, paranoid and isolated. I go to places like book stores, Pawn America for movies, Five Below, QuikTrip for food and Catholic Charities for food ect. I try to get outside and do stuff like disc golf or taking a walk. You could pick up a hobby like playing an instrument or diamond art/happy color to reduce stress and keep you busy. Listening to music especially helps me."
schizophrenia,fjziqj2,t1_fjzhovu,1583720689.0,"Yeah, I recently quit my job as a janitor a couple days ago. Don't think I'll accomplish much despite wanting to. Thinking about auditing some classes."
schizophrenia,fjzi4ko,t3_ffhqvo,1583720275.0,"Yeah, I just like being in school I guess. I just currently quit my job as a janitor. I feel like I'll never do anything better in my life."

schizophrenia,fjzfwoc,t1_fjzfka1,1583718784.0,"Thanks for the advice! Hah last question, do you regret putting the time and effort into your degree when you might not be able to work or was it worth it regardless?"
schizophrenia,fjzeu8h,t1_fjzdv15,1583718066.0,That's news to me. Can I ask you where you live?
schizophrenia,fjzd7jd,t1_fjzccir,1583716974.0,"I am just afraid I'll get my degree online and then be unable to work, leaving me with student debt. Vocational Rehab paid for my schooling but they generally don't pay for anything beyond an undergraduate, not that I'm ungrateful (for anyone looking for a degree, I recommend getting support from VR). So, what can you do about your student debt?"
schizophrenia,fjzbubf,t1_fjzbdxj,1583716063.0,I think I worded that wrong - how does your job work with your mental illness? Do you work at home? Do you work with people? I also did my undergraduate in psych online and would have no problem if I did graduate online.
schizophrenia,fjzairi,t1_fjysgxv,1583715170.0,Hi.. I am currently an undegrad and thinking of pursuing a graduate degree. I also want to go to school online and am interested in becoming an MRI tech but not sure how I'll deal with being around people so much. I was wondering what you went to school for and if it accommodates your illness?
schizophrenia,fjz50mt,t1_fjyecmf,1583711536.0,Humm maybe? That gives me a bit of hope.
schizophrenia,fjxbn73,t1_fjxbife,1583666432.0,Hahah perfect
schizophrenia,fjxb719,t1_fjxaoen,1583665783.0,And awesome idea for a new dating app!!
schizophrenia,fjxb65o,t1_fjxaoen,1583665748.0,"I agree with your point about not having to deal with the stigma. Many people automatically think I'm scary or homicidal or something because of misinformation about mental health. When I first started hanging out with this dude, I told him I was schizophrenic. He had to ask his mother (a counselor) to ask coworkers if I was dangerous and if it was okay to hang with me. That hurt."
schizophrenia,fjxa5yn,t1_fjx94cf,1583664271.0,Humm yeah idk.. I've just always wanted to date someone who has schizophrenia but don't know anyone irl with it
schizophrenia,fjx7fpb,t1_fjx6yiv,1583660342.0,But would it be more beneficial to date someone with the same disorder knowing that you are going through the same thing?
schizophrenia,fjx1x1v,t1_fjx0lfw,1583653035.0,I'll look into some of those and tell you what I think. I mostly like non-fiction. Not to seem presumptuous but have you ever seen the movie KIDS?
schizophrenia,fjwzwro,t1_fjnpp72,1583650709.0,"I read a lot as well. Areas of interest: philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. I think queer theory sounds cool; I'll hafta get in on that. Do you recommend any books on schizophrenia? Or something involving queer theory that I should check out?"
