relationship_advice,f60ylzp,t3_dq6qqy,1572629017.0,"I (18F) have struggled with very similar issues for a long time. You already understand that jealousy is often rooted in insecurity, and that's really good. A lot of people don't know why they get jealous. Illogical worries are usually a reflection of how we feel about ourselves, or of our emotional memory (i.e., having been cheated on, etc). Our brain develops associations to certain events as we go through life. Sometimes these associations (which are meant to protect us) trigger a response that isn't applicable to the present event. It's just a fundamental you-problem. And it blows. 

The only way to go about rewiring your reactions is to do some serious emotional work. Therapy is good, obviously, but if you can't afford it, utilize all the resources you have. For example, I'm poor, and I have a lot of accounts/subs on self-help in constant rotation. If you're interested in these, I can make a list of them for you. There are a lot of good, specific places on the internet, many that are run by actual mental health professionals. It's not a cure-all, but many things I've read about in these spaces has really helped me, as long as I retain/apply that information in my life; particularly about how to operate in a way that supports healthy relationships.

In the end, the reality is that your partner's character is always going to exist separately from your fears. If he respects you, he shouldn't do anything to betray you. If he doesn't, he might. If you're sure that he's committed to you, then the work falls on you to build your self esteem (with the support of your partner, if possible.). 

As far as day-to-day things that you can do to help ease this worry, I have a few ideas. It's important to communicate to your S/O how you feel. Try not to place blame on him or yourself. I think a good template for these discussions is often ""I feel _____ when ______."" It's okay to tell your partner that the jealousy is a stressor on it's own, and also in the fact that you fear he will leave you because of it. Sometimes we harbor on a thought until we're convinced it's true. But when we tell someone the thought, we realize it's so far from reality. That knowledge can make you feel a lot better sometimes.

It might also be helpful to work on this issue as a team. What can he do to help you feel a bit more validated? Considering this, as opposed to what he should stop doing, focuses more on the actual problem: your own insecurity. Unless he does something that is clearly a red flag.
Do you need more verbal affirmations? More touch? More quality time? Do some research on the 5 love languages if you haven't yet. It's been very useful for me.

And finally, what can you do to help him feel trusted? What behaviors help him feel loved and respected? It's always good to make it clear you're proud of him for the work he puts into his band, and you support him, as well.

I wish you the best of luck on this issue, OP! You have my support. Rock on."

relationship_advice,f5v6224,t3_dpfw48,1572484202.0,"I don't know your husband but it's possible theres missing context that explains this. There could be a logical reason that he saved the photos. I think you should mention it to him in a way that doesn't seem accusatory. Tell him how you feel, use those ""I felt _____ when I saw that you ______."" phrases. Until then, (if he's been a good partner otherwise), I'd give him the benefit of the doubt. Allow him the chance to explain. I hope this helps in some way! 

If you happen to communicate this to your partner, update us! Best of luck."

infp,f5llkrg,t3_dob2qb,1572280088.0,"im an infp female and i have this same exact problem. i really don't like the catty-type drama that can sometimes occur in friend groups of girls my age. i just don't entertain it, i don't talk shit and i don't care to listen to what juicy gossip is being passed around. so my fellow girls sometimes find me too shy or too stuck up. i have female friends and they're like me. but i can't just depend on one or two friends all of the time. like at work for example, it'd help to have some friends there. but the girls wanna talk shit about people, and if you don't participate, they talk shit about you. it sucks. to have friends that aren't super interested in the drama or mind games of socializing would be nice. just wanna hangout and have fun without that stress. but i don't know how to come across as friendly and no-bullshit at the same time. so i hear ya. don't really have advice but sometimes it helps to know that other people go through the same thing"
