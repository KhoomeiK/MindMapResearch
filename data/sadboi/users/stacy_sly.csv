I was always active - a dancer, took fitness classes but in 2005 I got serious. I teach Bodypump, general group exercise and dance classes. I direct a dance studio. My cardio consists of boot camp, barre, step and what I call ""CardiOya"" - a cardio Yoga-style class I started teaching recently. So, all of that put together means I don't have to really exercise on my own. I have to do it for work. I feel very strong. I can do 30+ pushups on my toes, feel really good doing high impact cardio. My goal at this point is to keep getting stronger and maintain my weight. I thought at 53 I wasn't going to ""get better"" as far as strength, cardio, etc. But you can get better!! I'm around 125 pounds at 5'4"" so I'm doing pretty good there but it's a constant struggle to not eat junk! :) I'm always sore LOL. It's mostly because I push it daily. I stretch, do a lot of two-a-days - cardio and then some sort of circuit/weightlifting daily. My job allows me to do that as far has having the time for it. Just last fall I was at 135 pounds - I didn't feel good at that weight. Heavy, out of shape.. I lost 10 going through a mental health ""crisis"" and I've worked hard to keep myself at 125 since. It's not easy but I'm committed!"

depression,fibkpcb,t3_f791jw,1582324044.0,I hear this. A year ago I thought my meds weren't working because some stuff had happened and I was getting depressed. Ended up going off those meds and trying 6 different meds that didn't work only to go back to what I was on a year ago and feel better again. It was a temporary reaction to life - not a depressive episode. Next time something like that happens - gosh I hope never of course - I won't be so quick to change meds.
depression,fi1ieg8,t3_f5nbbz,1582058370.0,"I guess if you're lying about it that's not cool. Are you sure you're not depressed? If you're saying you're lazy, worthless, etc. it sure sounds like depression to me."
depression,fg6vohq,t3_ex67l8,1580577956.0,I feel this way too. For me It’s like my brain is used to being depressed and doesn’t understand what these “new feelings” are of feeling better? They’re not really new but it’s been a long time since I felt good so I think my brain is confused.
BipolarReddit,fg06xnv,t3_ew67za,1580401544.0,I love this. Good for you!
antidepressants,ffpnnbw,t3_eugy4c,1580099663.0,Lamictal and Seroquel at night; Pristiq in the morning.
BipolarReddit,ffpnjna,t3_euf1ab,1580099580.0,At one point I just accepted it - that I would be on meds for the rest of my life. I don’t know when it happened. I guess it may have been about 5 years ago after a really bad manic episode I had. I feel better on them and I won’t let my mind trick me into thinking I don’t need them because I do.
antidepressants,ffpmya0,t3_eugk6m,1580099103.0,I did the genesight test and my doc put me on meds that showed my DNA would probably like I guess you could call it? I’m still on them today and doing pretty good. Doing the Genesight test was definitely worth it to find out what meds would most likely work for me.
antidepressants,ffk1lje,t3_eu2039,1580013021.0,One day won’t do that. There’s enough in your system to handle one missed dose. I wonder if you’re just getting sick - and I hope not. You’re right - prob not a 2-day hangover either.
antidepressants,ffig7in,t3_etr2wu,1579973117.0,It happens. Sometimes it takes a week or more for side effects to subside. Hang in there! More than two weeks of feeling bad though and I’d evaluate with your doc as to whether it’s worth it.
BipolarReddit,ffig1hl,t1_ffi6rx1,1579973002.0,Yes GoodRx! Can’t be that much on there. Don’t go through insurance. I get all my meds cheaper through GoodRx.
depression,ffift5u,t3_etkvgj,1579972843.0,And why did you guys decide to do this? Sounds like he went a little too far. On and on - if he’s your friend he should have sensed it was bothering you or at least realized he went overboard.
antidepressants,ffc4k70,t3_estxrp,1579791364.0,Maybe? Hard to say. I’m currently switching from Wellbutrin to Pristiq and feel the Pristiq has kicked in quickly. For a minute there I felt the two taken together was the way to go but then the side effects of Wellbutrin reminded me why I don’t feel that med is the best for me. It’s very possible that one will start working faster tho like you asked.
antidepressants,ff25jcw,t3_er5m4z,1579494400.0,It usually takes about a week or two for side effects to go away with Bupropion. I had a headache and bad tummy for a while and then it stopped and I felt better.
depression,fe00evo,t3_en7336,1578800074.0,I get this. It’s easier to be “sick” sometimes. If you’re better you’re just like everyone else too. No different. It’s a sick way to feel - I mean who wants to feel awful - but I do get it.
depression,fccm5m6,t3_egw1u2,1577600010.0,Same here. I’ve virtually stopped listening to the music that once inspired me. I know it isn’t good. Your post made me remember that thanks.
depression,fccl5sa,t1_fcbqmy9,1577599665.0,Thank you for that reminder. I want to believe. I’m just so beaten down. I know you are right though. I’m trying to find it.
depression,fcck85s,t3_egu121,1577599349.0,Yes. All of this. I can’t add much else. Depression steals your life. Things that once brought you joy don’t matter anymore. I personally can barely function. I have this huge cloud hanging over me and I can’t see out of it. Not even little shimmers of light. When? When will it get better. Why do meds take so long to work? I’ve had to start over so many times with new meds that I think it’s the reason I’m nauseous half the time. My body doesn’t know what’s going on. Please just make it stop hurting so much. Please.
depression,fcblj5f,t3_cml6ni,1577588260.0,"I can’t remember ever feeling this bad. It’s like there’s this dark cloud hanging over me. That doesn’t even explain it - it’s much worse than that. You know when you have this weird feeling that something just isn’t right? It’s an overwhelming sadness that won’t go away. There’s no relief from it. It’s a constant feeling. 

I don’t know how I’m going to pull myself out of this depression either. Many months of med changes, nothing seems to be working. I’m having physical symptoms now too. My stomach is a wreck; food doesn’t taste good; I’ve lost about 7-8 pounds so far. 

I don’t know what else to say. I need some relief. Just some small “good” feeling - a few minutes even - to just let me know that it’s going to be ok. That I’ll get myself back. :("
bipolar,fcagy8a,t1_factuhm,1577569057.0,"You start trying stuff that’s in the yellow column, the “use with caution” meds. That’s what I’m doing now. I’m trying Wellbutrin and it’s in the yellow column for me."

If not, you can sit here and cry if you want. We're here."" Wow. I have some really good friends. Just wow."
bipolar,fa96gj3,t3_e3csjx,1575863683.0,I’m on the same combo just having started lithium 2 weeks ago. Lamictal I’ve been on for years. I felt the same way - still do: “Shit just got real. I guess I really am bipolar.” So far I notice nothing. I’m still very depressed and now started having symptoms of panic. Does anyone know how long it takes for Lithium to kick in? The doc said something about blood tests letting you know if it’s at a therapeutic level. Maybe that’s when I’ll notice something. Meanwhile I still feel like shit.
bipolar,fa95vpr,t3_e7ydl1,1575863243.0,Genesight helped until there were no more on the list. :(
bipolar,fa95q08,t3_e83iye,1575863130.0,^ you said it: “the performance of sanity.” Daily for me. Lately it’s how to stop myself from crying when around other people. That’s a performance too.
BipolarReddit,fa8jmqa,t3_e7yiew,1575847776.0,I wish there was. I am in and out of stability. Right now I’m not. I’m on my 4th med change this year. I went from taking an antidepressant with Lamictal to no antidepressant and trying anti psychotics. Then we dumped the ant psychotics. Now I’m trying Lithium with the Lamictal. Luckily I have periods of 3-5 years where I’m stable. To me that is good. I wish I had years and years of stability but that hasn’t been the case.
bipolar,f9ctrd1,t3_e4ia96,1575227249.0,Oh yes. I miss mania so much but it’s so destructive for me. I hate that I have no energy right now. That I love to workout but now it’s a chore. That I don’t feel like hanging out with people; that I have no energy to even laugh at this point. My mania is usually all about anger so believe me people close to me are happy I’m “stable.”

bipolar,f9crw35,t3_e422x7,1575226752.0,I hate this. It’s so wrong. Just happened to me at my sister in law’s. Her son has been diagnosed ADHD but she says she found out her ex’s sister is bipolar. Says “that’s awful and can’t be treated.” Whatever. I looked at my husband like “don’t you dare say anything.” Luckily he didn’t. I hear comments like this all the time and ignore them.

BipolarReddit,f0uyq1r,t3_d6ofmz,1568955659.0,"I hear you on this!! I think that too for me with 24 years on meds. 

My doc told me about something cool tho - she said there’s studies out there that show if you’re bipolar (or other mental health conditions too) and don’t take meds for it you’re more susceptible to dementia when your in your 70’s and 80’s. 

I can see that. A brain that’s “sick” and never “healed” can get sicker? I just thought it was pretty interesting."
BipolarReddit,f0uyiq0,t3_d6i35q,1568955428.0,"Lamictal is the #1 reason why I am doing well. It saved me in so many ways. It calmed my mood swings, made me “sane.” I don’t think I will ever stop taking it because of course Bipolar doesn’t go away. No problems at all with it; no side effects that I can tell."
BipolarReddit,f0ux86q,t3_d6bl4z,1568953983.0,"I have the same problem. Antidepressants make me manic. Has anyone talked about genesight testing here? It’s DNA testing to see how certain meds will work. There are only a few antidepressants I can take that came up on the list. I was on one of those meds for 4 years - felt good - but it stopped working. Just started another one and feeling ok - not sure yet since its only been about 3 weeks. 

At any rate this test helps!!! Consider doing it."
BipolarReddit,f0uwsbl,t3_d6ofmz,1568953507.0,"I agree it is a brutal guessing game - a good way to put it. I’ve been in treatment for 24 years. I’ll never be out of treatment. It’s the card I’ve been dealt. 

I know that the one med that really made a difference for me was Lamictal. Have you tried that? I’ve never taken Lithium before. They have different properties but are both mood stabilizers. I think it’s worth a try if you’ve never taken it. I also take Seroquel and that made a difference for me too. 

Hang in there. It’s not easy. Lots of trial and error for me after 24 years. It’s worth it though."
BipolarReddit,f0uwc20,t3_d6ox9h,1568953031.0,"How many mgs do you take? My doc just increased my amount to 200 mgs. I used to be on 100 and in the last 6 months I went from 150 and now up to 200. I’m in a manic state right now so I need it. I hope to lower the dose as things calm down. 

A bunch of years ago I was on 300 and that’s when I felt brain fog. Told the doc that and she said we’ll watch it. 

I feel that I’m “not myself” when medicated. In fact I hate meds because they calm me down and I don’t want to be calmed down. But, in order to not lose jobs, friends and a host of other things I know I need meds. I think it’s kind of a “bipolar thing” in that many of us know we need meds but love the high of bipolar mania. It’s too destructive though for me."
