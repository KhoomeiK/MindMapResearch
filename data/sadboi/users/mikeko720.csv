hearthstone,fg4t6nq,t3_ewgs6y,1580510564.0,Hey the deck looks like complete garbage wasn't all that serious about it when I made it. But for some reason those particular set of 30 cards there seemed to word pretty well and there is dragons in it there's like four or five not many but it seem to still work. I don't know it was fun if you have the cards you should try it it was a lot better than what I thought it was going to be.
Hearthstone_Druid,fg1xpq1,t3_ewgcjh,1580434792.0,Okay okay the only reason I made this post cuz a couple of the people I played quit on Turn 3 once they seem what I was doing. I found it hilarious...lol

But had a couple Quest for priests and just decided to do them (Not  as bad as i thought.IT WAS FUN....) anyway my point is  priest players with your priest cards killing me in one turn ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ IT'S infuriating what I was getting at is basically priest look like it has like all kinds of cards to copy everything...but...idn. just what I thought I saw. Also had good ideas for Hunter and Warrior but not going to share all to myself

        P.S I made Highlander deathrattle priest deck"

hearthstone,f8xmo97,t1_f8xkpc2,1574924234.0,"Actually would have hit Legend a whil ago I'm pretty sure I did something I usually don't do I decided to play a tier 1 deck at least I believe it was Tier 1 it was when was like a aggro warlock when that was really popular and good so yeah i like in but I didn't Dennis start till the  the end of month and then it Cycles out of standard but yeah that's pretty much when I went from like rank 20 the rank 5 in like a day and then the next day I think I made it
 rink 3 my win rate was like 90% from 20 to 5"
hearthstone,f8xm6d4,t1_f8xluer,1574923645.0,How many wins have you got an arena? Weirdest thing when I first started playing I actually did really well in Arena that's actually started hitting 7 or eight wins anymore these days I only get like three or four winds seems like that or I'll go three and out
hearthstone,f8xlujl,t3_e2trrx,1574923272.0,Honestly I know what my problem is I refuse to take a tier 1 deck to Legend I know I won't feel as in accomplished if I do I'm a very creative person especially when it comes to makeup up cool decks that are fun to play I really just want to get there to Legend with something I created and no one else is playing or has really heard of I make so mini fun and wacky decks I think some of my deck ideas are genius I just don't think I'm good enough to play some of them
ArenaHS,f8xkgdz,t3_e2qluy,1574921808.0,Just off the top of my head Warriors sound seems like it's going to be awesome warmaster the copy dragons in your hand bloodswarm to copy things on the board too also Drake lancer will be good I believe so many things yeah just for your going to be sick
AskMen,f8xi4nq,t3_e2kkvh,1574919516.0,I don't think I would mind if it was my son but if it was my daughter dating an 18 year old guy it would be bad probably do something real stupid. When I was 16 I was dating a 23 year old I turned 18 we moved in together family didn't like it they said I was obsessed with her I would tell them I was in love but now I'm in my 30s and I realized it wasn't love it was obsession that sex
Battlegrounds,f8xh227,t3_e2t9u4,1574918551.0,Typo 4500
hearthstonecirclejerk,eypqr62,t1_eyppl3z,1567308181.0,Basically casting boom Zooka three times in a game is really good with death rattles
hearthstonecirclejerk,eypn117,t3_cy3v9a,1567304916.0,So you know you play Arcane Dynamo and most of the time you get a boom Zooka just rattles and things like Undertaker its pretty good still working on it making tweaks and stuff it's pretty expensive too.
hearthstone,evravu5,t1_evr73us,1564704516.0,I actually ended up trying something different like I just about clicked on that one legendary that I was going to get but I changed my mind at the last second and got it I can't think of their names that one casting neutral card that kills a murloc yeah I got two of those and made a hunter murloc deck with a little bit of Beast Synergy mix in
hearthstone,evp5x66,t3_ckk002,1564666822.0,Anyone know how you copy your deck list and moving from your Android to a comment
hearthstone,evp0s4e,t3_ckk002,1564663346.0,So I'm pretty sure I just made the best decks in The Meta and I can almost promise almost anyone they haven't seen anything like it
hearthstone,evok9hy,t1_evo3l2j,1564648876.0,First match I won turn 5 without testing it game 2 I ended up going against Mage conjurings calling got him down to 4 would have killed him next turn in my defense so I think he got his first two big guys out turn the five or six
hearthstone,evoibmv,t3_ckk002,1564647354.0,So I finally finished the deck very first game rank 15 I won Turn 5 hahaha I knew it
hearthstone,evo6ejs,t3_ckk002,1564639530.0,I did it got rid of Luti got Mukla I'm making at least rank 5 with this deck that I'm going make
hearthstone,evo5t2d,t3_ckk002,1564639156.0,I don't know I just like to be creative Trey out cards that don't get played much not that you can be all that creative with that card unless you count winning on Turn 5
hearthstone,evo5gqr,t1_evo451d,1564638946.0,Yeah I mean you have a point not like it's a good card I know that.
hearthstone,evo539n,t1_evo4ikz,1564638713.0,I have every Hunter card except one thanks though there's a few cards I haven't got to try out yet it fit what I'm doing
hearthstone,evo4nqu,t3_ckk002,1564638455.0,If it goes the way I think it will I'll be able to win like six turn and if it doesn't win the early game I don't think I'll have any problems midpoint. late game might be an issue I maybe a few spells and a Zul'jin maybe it's fine not till it's going to be that good anyway but I bet I can make it to Legend
hearthstone,evo3yaj,t1_evo3dgc,1564638021.0,I don't know I'm just trying to use a lot of the cards that are like that really cheap big stuff with some beasts synergy
hearthstone,evo2wkm,t3_ckk002,1564637394.0,Basically I only need 400 more dust King Mukla lol basically because I think I can make a really quick killing Hunter deck
hearthstone,evo2ktg,t1_evo2dlw,1564637195.0,By the way would that card be used in like a zoo Deck would that work
