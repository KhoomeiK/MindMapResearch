1. This was kinda like a long distance thing. We’d meet when we could both afford it. It went on for a year. But one day was a bit different. We was going to go away together, and being summer it was expensive. I had to save up for 4 months putting in extra hours. I bought my tickets and hotel etc. Etc. Then she didn’t show. All that hard earned money gone. Just like that. Then when we finally spoke to each other again, it didn’t take long to work out she had no intention of showing. This experience sent my depression into the gaping holes of hell. I got into cutting; my mind only thought of death, and I taught myself to tie a noose. It really killed me inside.
 
2. This was just a “normal” relationship that went on for 2 years. Although after a while it became toxic. I payed for 95% of what we did. As a result we broke up over a year ago and I’m still in a bit of debt. We broke up because she was getting with someone else when she was still with me. For my birthday we was going to go on holiday together, we done this before, but this time it was going to be a new country we both wanted to visit. Anyway, 1 week before my birthday we’re due to go. She breaks up with me. And wants both tickets. Remembering I paid for it. So she goes away with him, and I paid for it.... (yes I got it back eventually). 
 
 
I’ve been desperate for relationships in the past; I completely understand even if my 2 short stories make you want it more. But trust me when I say they really aren’t all they’re built up to be. It’s just disappointing and expensive. I’m over relationships and I think having SO’s is overrated. I didn’t even mention the complaining daily you have to deal with. 
 
Maybe I’ve only had toxic relationships; maybe I’m the problem, that’s more accurate let’s be honest. But you really don’t want a toxic relationship. Let’s go back to your bread analogy. If the mouldy break would give you daily diarrhoea for the rest of your life, would you still eat it?"

Whilst I do have a car and a licence. I’m in a similar situation. 
 
My ex cheated on me after 2 years of being with her. (2 weeks before we were due to go on holiday as part of my birthday celebration, on which she took the other guy, which I paid for; but I did at least get my money back eventually)
 
Some apprentices our age are earning the minimum £3.90 /hour. That’s just £175 a month. So £800 a month isn’t so bad. Just try to get some savings going if you’d like some spare dough (yes I know how hard that is, I’m in £k’s of debt as a result)
 
I also don’t have many friends, my old school friends are either married, with child, both, or in the army. I have just 1 friend left who I can only see once every month due to our work schedules. 
 
I binge on video games and TV series since mechanical screens and consoles can’t judge me. I watched season 3 of stranger things in just 1 day. (Amazing show btw). I also then went on to complete “The Crew” in just 3 days.
 
Everyday that passes now my parents ask me what’s wrong. And I just have to say “nothing I’m fine why?”. They never used to ask me this so obviously it’s starting to show worse. 
 
Try to take up a hobby besides video games, I always recommend golf to people but I know it’s not everyone’s thing. Sometimes it’s pretty expensive too which wouldn’t be ideal for you. But the range is cheap if you got a few clubs already. Alternatively you could learn a musical instrument? I guess it’s up to you.

For ME it happens the morning after I think about what I want to achieve in life. When I realise I got like 0.0001% of actually achieving it I become depressed for a long period of time and feel like giving up (a lot of people in the past have told me to give my on my dreams, including my parents; I wanted to prove them wrong; 6 years later I’m only further away. But again this something I’ve noticed for ME) 
 
Vague details are likely given to you because he may not know the source exactly, or maybe he is just become rather fatigued due to the low energy depression brings to you. 
 
Everyone is different so take the following as advisory and make a judgement from it yourself. If you notice he is depressed or tells you he is depressed, asking why isn’t a great idea. Simply offer him comfort. Make a cup of tea and watch a movie together or something. When I’m feeling really down I hate being asked what’s wrong. On the other hand if he tells you. Detailed or not, just accept it and ask how you can help, and let him know that you’re there for him if he needs anything. You’re allowed to feel anxious or worried; but telling them directly can only make it worse.

NoFap,eq9g8wb,t3_bxt1cb,1559905360.0,"I don’t think you need to see a doctor quite yet. Our bodies as humans are lazy, if we don’t need something, our body will get rid of it. For example if a champion body builder quit the gym and exercise for a month; their weight and aesthetics would be lost incredibly fast. Since they don’t need them to lift anymore.
 
My advice is to go to the gym and work on your Core strength, and glutes (ass muscles). This as a result will strengthen your pelvis. You’d be surprised how important core strength is in general. 
 
Along with core exercises I recommend squats and something like [this](https://youtu.be/L49T5D1x3qE) to really engage the core and pelvis. 
 
Most of all I recommend a clean healthy diet. I’m not saying go crazy for greens. Just healthier than you are now. Try to snack on fruit instead of sugar. And try to eat real clean chicken rather than something fast food or processed. 
 
If after a month of taking this seriously your problem persists; I’d then rethink seeing a doctor for if it’s an underlying issue. 
 
 
**Please Note: this is an educational piece of advice based on my 8 year knowledge of weight training and general knowledge of how our bodies internally react to change. I’m not a doctor. But I am/was a PMO addict for 12 years. My advice was based on a lifestyle that doesn’t already involve a form of consistent exercise and a poor diet. If my assumptions are true. I have complete faith in my advice as helpful providing you have no other underlying problems.**
 
 
Hope I am of help."
NoFap,eq9emno,t3_bxphgi,1559903137.0,"The way I see real sex is the following; 
 
Hookups or paid sex = relapse. 
 
Sex with a GF = not relapse. 
 
Hookups and prostitutes are just us giving into our PMO desires with a loophole. It’s still makes a negative effect on us. So it’s a relapse unless it’s a GF."
NoFap,eq9d0b9,t1_eq9cas7,1559900595.0,"Yea exactly, rather than seeing its as. 
 
“I relapsed after 30 day”
 
See it as “I fapped once in 30 days”"
NoFap,eq9bt9e,t1_eq8ph2x,1559898609.0,I’m 50d porn free but I struggle to kick masturbation and fantasising away with it. All my relapses are just MO and honestly it’s just as soul destroying as PMO. It may not be as “brain destroying” as PMO is. But in terms of emotional destruction it’s just as bad. GL in your 90 days
NoFap,eq7ypqn,t3_bxlq9j,1559855557.0,Never too late. It just means your rewire may take longer than others is all. This is also dependant in other factors. Such as how long fapping daily and how many times.
NoFap,eq7y1vf,t3_bxlin4,1559855237.0,Awesome post. You mentioned we all want to be loved. For people to love us like we want. Firstly we must love ourselves.
