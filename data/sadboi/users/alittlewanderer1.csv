mentalhealth,fqy1rkp,t1_fqvt8s9,1589741190.0,"hi friend! i respect your opinion, and i totally understand where you're coming from! however, i do think that our disagreement comes from a fundamental disagreement in philosophies, which is totally fine! we can disagree. you say that ""life isn't meant to suck."" i disagree. do i think life *is* meant to suck? of course not. i personally don't think that life owes us anything. people can find fulfillment in their lives and that's *amazing* and i don't want to discount that at all, but i don't think it's because they were owed anything. i also don't identify as religious and don't believe the universe owes us anything, so perhaps that does inform my beliefs. 

additionally, when you say that ""change comes in a favorable way"", i do agree. i never said to not enjoy the respites from the darkness. i'm sorry that my response was not to your liking, and i respect that because what's the right thing for me is not necessarily the right thing for you, and that's okay! however, i don't think it's fair to generalize my response as completely inappropriate. is it perfect? certainly not, and i get that my opinion can be very polarizing. of course, this is *not* me bashing you in any way, and i have nothing but love for you and anyone who reads this in my heart :) i just wanted to express my thoughts a bit more. take care!"
mentalhealth,fquy0vg,t3_gl2bq4,1589666264.0,"maybe this doesn't totally pertain to your situation, but something that has helped me a lot is learning the difference between laziness, procrastination, and executive dysfunction

laziness: i don't want to do the thing so i won't do the thing, and honestly i don't care about doing the thing so i'm not worrying about it

procrastination: i'm putting off doing the thing because i don't want to do the thing, but there's usually a reason behind it besides just not wanting to do it, like maybe the thing is causing you stress/anxiety/whatever, or maybe procrastination itself is causing that

executive dysfunction: i may/may not want to do the thing (doesn't really matter either way) but for some reason i just *can't do the thing* and it's really stressful and causing me lots of anxiety because i still have to do the thing.

learning to recognize which of these three things i'm doing in the moment has been incredibly helpful because if i'm being lazy? just ask myself, why don't i care? is this important and needs to be done? what are some steps i can take to do that? if i'm procrastinating, what's so stressful about this? will my stress be eased if i just get it over with now? executive dysfunction: what can i do to help me do the thing?

another thing that helps me is my little timer trick: i set a timer for 2 minutes and tell myself that i only have to work for 2 minutes- that's it. 2 minutes is a really short time, after all. if, after those 2 minutes, i can go another two minutes, i set the timer again for 2 minutes. rinse and repeat. if, after those two minutes, i decide i *can't* go another two minutes, i take a 5 minute break and then try again. 

and lastly, talking to someone helps! ideally a professional but covid exists so here's a [free resource](https://www.7cups.com/18399456) that might help! take care and be safe!"
mentalhealth,fquwkc0,t3_gl2ju0,1589665634.0,"don't get me wrong, life sucks. it's shit and it's hard and awful things happen all the time. but life's a bitch and you keep on living, because why not? you can die literally any time you want, so what's the rush? there are breaks in the snowstorm, times when it lightens to a flurry or even when the sun breaks out through the clouds and for a moment you feel the warmth touch your skin. it can get better, and anchoring onto those little moments is amazing. it could also get worse, and that would suck, but hey, you can die then if you really want to. you have a choice, regardless of what your brain is telling you to do. i hope you can stick around for another ray of sunshine :)

the one thing that i ALWAYS force myself to do on a bad day is to get out of bed and change my clothes. sometimes it's next to impossible and it's taken me literal hours to do that before, but that's the one non-negotiable thing that i do on bad days, and it definitely helps me feel better. i dunno how strict your lockdown rules are, but if you have a balcony or a backyard or are even able to sit next to an open window, being outside can help a lot (as long as it's safe!! your safety is your priority!) if it's possible, taking a shower (or even using baby wipes) can help, as well as doing small activities. something i personally do is i keep a lot of half-finished crafts around, like knitting or weaving or origami, and sometimes i can get myself to knit an extra row on a scarf or finish that half-folded flower, since it's easier to continue something than to start it. and of course, talking to people can help. personally when i'm feeling depressed i don't like to talk aloud, but texting friends or using a platform like [this one](https://www.7cups.com/18399456) helps. and if you can move around a little (i'm not talking full on exercising, but like a short walk, if possible, can really help. and if you have a good/less bad day, i highly encourage you to meal prep, if possible! i always make it a priority to prepare easy-to-freeze meals so that if i'm having an episode, i can just take something out and microwave it, which is way easier. ok this is getting long but these are just some things that i personally do, hope something helps! take care!"
depression,fpa33z6,t3_gc9ebq,1588439838.0,"eventually you do have to want to get better, but it's ok if that's not true at the start. part of what helped me begin getting better was talking to a few people about what's been going on. they wanted me to keep going, and i felt guilty about the thought of betraying them and giving up, so i kept going. maybe not the healthiest, but after pushing myself out of guilt, it slowly started turning into pushing myself because, well, if i'm already this close to being a functional human, who knows how much better i can get with a little mroe time. doing small things can help, if possible. finding little reasons to stay, whether it's a project or a video game or a book/movie/tv show you want to read. and there are always free resources online for you to talk to people, like [this one](https://www.7cups.com/18399456), as well as platforms like reddit. i'm rooting for you :)"
Anxiety,fpa2kmv,t3_gc8saq,1588439527.0,"i get that too, but it tends to happen less if i eat right and drink enough water and sleep well. doing things like that to take care of yourself can help. also, what can help me is exercising, doing breathing/grounding exercises, and talking to people, either irl or using a platform like [this one](https://www.7cups.com/18399456). hope some of this helps, or at least makes you feel a little less alone :)"

Anxiety,fnfxlpf,t3_g1it1p,1586917644.0,"first, a little sciencey stuff. while this isn't the case for everyone, the majority of depressive episodes self-terminate (they end by themselves eventually) and therapy is there in order to get to that place faster. so, know that this episode will get better, and seeing your therapist is a wonderful step. plus, that's probably why you were able to ""snap out of it"" that first time, in your words :)

second, the obligatory note that there are lots of free resources if you need to talk or you need a temporary substitute until you can talk to your therapist. [this one](https://www.7cups.com/18399456) is my fave, there are plenty more though.

now, onto the less sciencey stuff. as someone who's been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (still have that diagnosis) as well as major depressive disorder (not anymore, but in the past) i get that it's so so hard. the bad days are really bad, and it takes so much courage to have hope in spite of it. you're being really brave right now, and i think it's important to have someone tell you that. it takes a lot of courage to keep going despite feeling awful. but it does get better, and you've proven that to yourself already. you're really strong, okay? so keep being strong and lean on the people and resources in your life to keep you strong. i'm rooting for you <3"
