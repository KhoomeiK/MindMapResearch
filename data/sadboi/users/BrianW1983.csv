First, priests are always moved around anyways. It happens all the time. Priests go to different parishes depending on if there's a need like another Priest retiring.

Buddha was a real guy who meditated under a tree and never claimed to be divine.

So, Pascal's Wager is still true because even if Islam is the right religion, that doesn't mean Christians are going to hell. Same with Judaism. But, atheists will go to hell if these religions are true. Atheism is the worst choice according to Pascal because you can't win the ultimate prize.

AskReddit,fqqwtsz,t1_fqqv2vb,1589573395.0,"

1. Yes. There are many different religions. That's why one should study the various religions and find out which one is most likely to be true. Clearly, Pascal thought the Christianity was. Christianity is based on an actual person in Jesus. It's not the same as the Pagan myths like Zeus. Ask any scholar if Zeus was a real person and get back to me :)


2. There is some psychological research that one can actually create a belief. Or change one. So some people can simply act like they're nicer than they are and eventually they will actually become nicer. Cognitive Behavioral therapy is based on this.

If you were a serious Christian, you know Jesus was a real person. 

3. Jesus was a real God because he rose from the dead. We have the empty tomb and his missing body and the dozens of Resurrection appearances. He proved his God-like status by defeating death.

There's literally no reason why the Apostles would make up the resurrection story. They were murdered for it with no benefit. 

There's literally no other explanation for why Christianity spread so rapidly in Jerusalem unless something miraculous happened like the resurrection."
AskReddit,fqqqft0,t1_fqqogch,1589570103.0,"1. Of course it matters who his audience was. One must take Pascal's Wager in context. He was writing to the cynical gambling agnostics of his generation in Paris that thought Christianity could be true but they weren't sure. That's why he compares it to a coin toss.


2. Pascal wrote that we should try to convince ourselves to believe by studying scriptures and going to Mass and taking holy water. The atheists don't even want to study the topic.


3. Zeus was a myth because he was invented by Pagan religions. The vast majority of historical scholars believe that Jesus was a real person.

The atheists that compare Jesus to myths like Zeus or simply ignorant of historical time periods.
