AskReddit,fqcs0mk,t1_fqb39g9,1589267025.0,"I would argue that if you work hard then you should be able to afford a decent retirement, regardless of your career choice. If you listened to the advice given to you and went to college, then it's not your fault if that just turned out to be an expensive mistake that provided no opportunity for you. That's it's not your fault if your hard work doesn't get reworded while nepotism promotes others ahead of you. And it's not your fault if you had to establish your self during the great recession only to fall flat. It's not your fault if you lose your family and support.

The idea that these are all outcomes you deserve for choosing wrong, that you should burden yourself with responsibility for not being able to provide yourself with $500 a month from age 25 is insane to me."

BoJackHorseman,fgb1duk,t1_fgacqig,1580657561.0,"Who said remove his guilt? I just think the true burden of responsibility isn't being shared as it should. And of course it matters if you can't tell reality from fantasy because of drugs or hypnosis or sci-fi bullshit. If I shoot someone in a videogame and everyone acts stunned like I killed a real person because it turns out I wasn't in a VR SIM but in the real world then that is a night and day scenario to a individual deliberately shooting someone to death.

'>!Well if Bojack couldnâ€™t distinguish acting from reality, why would that matter? In neither of those cases would what he have done been acceptable.'!<

To flip this around so you can see my argument, wouldn't Bojack choking Gina because he was sober and saw Gina and wanted to murder her in full public view not have been worse than him losing his mind and believing he was Philbert, a noir detective in a fictional TV show? Because from your quote above it sounds like you see the two scenarios as identical and that's what I can't fathom.

Nobody seems to give PC or the director or any of the crew shit for the compete lack of health and safety concern for either of their actors.

BoJackHorseman,fga5q6q,t1_fg86mzz,1580647020.0,"Unpopular opinion: criminal action requires responsibility. Bojack was high on pain medication and out of his mind. He shouldn't have put himself in that situation, yes, but being out of your mind means you make bad decisions. Bojack is responsible for not getting help and continuing to work when unfit. He is not responsible for trying to choke Gina. He basically went mad and was no longer able to separate his role as an actor from reality.

Criminal responsibility should rest with the production team, including the director and PC who allowed someone clearly high on pain medication to perform a stunt that involved crushing another person's neck. That's fucked up.

I don't want to diminish Gina's reaction at all, that was completely on point, but since the incident was staged by production, I feel like they are ultimately the ones who should take responsibility. I guess I might feel different if it had happened at Bojacks house rather than on set of Bojacks house. I mean Philbert."
