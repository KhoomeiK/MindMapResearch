For instance, I felt constantly ugly or unwanted when I had a partner who was more stubborn than I was, and had constantly rejecting behavior (i.e. would start to initiate sex and then suddenly stop without explaining, couldn’t sit next to me on the couch in front of other people because she was so uncomfortable with PDA). If you can think of anything that happens like this outside of the other stuff, it might resolve the issue, but if you don’t think or can’t directly perceive that anything weird is happening in terms of communication like this, best to send her home and not make you two any more miserable."

relationships,f0u6kx9,t3_d6lnmt,1568935011.0,"I feel like you would need to talk to a therapist about this, because not many of us are equipped to make mass generalizations about the autism spectrum, but this is my take:

The way I see it, people with manic-depressive and personality disorders, whom you’re usually attracted to, have predictable character flaws that are opposite to your own and make them manipulate you emotionally and physically. While this may be due to their own prior traumas and neglect, it’s not acceptable for them to treat you this way and that’s what you’re afraid of.

I feel that the autism spectrum is way different than the others because it’s not related to how people perceive and manipulate other people...it’s actually the opposite. It’s an inability to perceive and manipulate other people because of lacking social cues. This may or may not actually be super compatible with someone like you.

Because of your history, you might think your new boyfriend is willfully doing things to annoy you or disrespect you (when you get to a certain point in the relationship), but it’ll actually turn out that he can’t predict what annoys you, and you’ll have to tell him up-front. If he cares about you, he’ll probably apologize and take care in the future. Also, it’ll be hard to be attracted to this kind of personality at first because you’re normally attracted to the push-and-pull of someone who wants you close and suddenly wants space, and does this in a malicious way. He probably will be fairly consistent and predictable in his wants. Again, I’m not 100% sure. But it sounds like if he’s been good to you so far and you’re attracted to him, he’s a good match."

He wouldn’t be in a committed relationship with you if he wasn’t into you, but he likes to run, sends mixed signals, and probably in a grandiose way, secretly relishes that you grasp onto them before he pulls them away.

I’d say, get out of there. The relationship is still new and you’ve already experienced a world of hurt and been called “clingy” so much that you’re taking all the blame. It’s time to find someone who actually likes being around you, and when they set boundaries, gives you a specific and clear time that they’ll return to you, or apologizes later for miscommunications without acting like it’s your fault or a ton of work. For instance, when you say, “Oh! I thought you meant we’d spend this morning together,” the other person is secure enough to say, “Oops, I’m sorry! I didn’t communicate well. Tomorrow morning/this evening instead?”

It might be hard to believe, because you’re attracted to this type of push-and-pull person, but there is someone out there who wants to spend time with you often and will reassure you when you get emotionally activated. Let him go find someone who doesn’t mind being neglected once a day (trust me, it will be just as hard or harder for him to find someone who likes being treated that way, as it will be for you to find someone who can support your needs)."

Even if this is a “submissive” role, it’s not a crime to want to make people feel comfortable and I don’t understand why it’s bad if everyone involved benefits from it, including you.

Try a therapist to see if you’re anxious to allow yourself to express your wants or to allow people to serve you as well (childhoods where you’re raised with narcissistic or demanding parents mean you feel unable to ask others for things). The way I see it, you have interests, and other people are simply telling you that your interests are too under-the-radar or submissive."

She never, though, enforces that I should be doing a task or threatens consequences. She just makes annoying comments and these aren’t very often. I’d say, if your mom threatens consequences for not doing a task or restricts you from certain parts of your life, that is definitely abusive behavior and to do what other commenters suggest and delete the app.

The main reason my mom has it, is because I live far from her and she could see if I were to be abducted with my phone. I may be a legal adult, but she sees me as still part of her family unit and she’s responsible for my well-being. Just because I’m in my early 20s, doesn’t mean I’m not in danger when I’m wandering a city by myself. If this seems more like her reasoning, talk to her about the other unnecessary comments or frequent checking, but try to be understanding of her perspective if she’s just trying to have a resource if you were ever in a crisis or kidnapping situation."

I just had a breakup with my ex-girlfriend for some of the same reasons. I would have talked about her the same way you talk about your gf: cool, insanely pretty, etc. and I was infatuated with her and always preoccupied over the details of the relationship. Ultimately, I couldn’t give up control over these tiny details — I felt it meant that as much as I was committed and willing to do things for her, she was not as invested in doing things for other people or seeing other perspectives, something extremely important to me. Our relationship was based on me doing things for her and worshipping her, which didn’t feel good in the end.

I, of course, couldn’t tell if I was just overreacting and sensitive (which it sounds like it’s hard for you to tell as well), but it’s important that you’re with someone who doesn’t make you feel like you’re overreacting when you ask for something."

I don’t know why people say those things — maybe out of bitterness. I think the people who saw quickly-forming relationships burn to the ground were from poorly managing passion and ignoring problems of communication and differences in values. The same people who are commenting those negative things probably really loved someone a lot, didn’t manage those feelings or the growth that comes with it (the people we are most attracted to, mirror to us our childhood hurt so that we can overcome it and become the people we are meant to be, but there is work involved) and are bitter that they settled for something less than passionate, involved, and requiring growth.

If it feels good, and you’re watching for red flags, then the start doesn’t even really matter. It’s from now on that you need to, down the road, regulate your emotions about someone you really love. For instance, later, does that person’s spontaneity that you loved in the first part of the relationship, turn into something you perceive more as immaturity or lack of regard for responsibility?

The hurtful part is that they don’t give you any tools for letting go or regaining self-confidence. It’s hard to let go of someone if you’re thinking, “Maybe they got scared of what wonderful things I could provide,” which could always be the case, if that eases your heartache any. But know that you still don’t deserve to be played with, even if it’s the result of a surplus of feeling rather than a deficit — they still made the decision to hurt you.

It’s hard to regain self-confidence and a will to put yourself out there for others if someone never gives you constructive criticism or a personal reason for it (“I think the ways you show support are different from the ways I receive it”). That’s not fair at all, and leaves room for you to wonder if you’re inadequate. But just know that, even if someone doesn’t like one thing you do or one way you communicate, it’s their job to first request that you change your behavior in a way that suits them and allow you a chance to do so.

When you were growing up, was it vital that you were a people pleaser, and were you punished for being assertive? This is often the case with young women.

First, allow yourself to be assertive. It does depend on the scenario. This whole plan takeover situation, in the group chat, you would probably want to say, “Well, since it was my offer originally, and I wanted to do this specific activity, I’d like to do that. Otherwise, you two can split off and do what you were planning to do, and I can go find someone else to do this with me.” It’s hard, especially if you didn’t have anyone else lined up to do the activity with. Chances are, they’ll realize their proposal is unfair and do your original activity (if your friend is comfortable enough with you and cares about you enough to take criticism), or they will truly split off (if this person is just an acquaintance and doesn’t care enough about your feelings) and you’ll have to wait until someone else can do what you wanted, whether it’s on the same day or the next week. Either way, you’ve thinned out the amount of people who are going to invalidate or take advantage of you.

It’s really hard when it seems like you’d take any company over no company at all, but the more you cultivate those friendships where you can express your needs and cull those that invalidate your feelings, your circle will grow stronger and you’ll grow more confident. Reminder that you can also always meet new people who, in a few weeks’ or months’ time, might be more considerate of your feelings than those who cancel or change plans on you.

Does she attend the same school she did before, and is it a good environment for her? Are there group counseling sessions she can access to meet more people like herself?

Also, if she doesn’t drive or have access to a car, be as fluid as you can about helping her get out to see her friends or having them come visit. Especially if they’re people who validate her identity and make her feel good about herself!"

BPD,eyekpyq,t1_eyejsj4,1567035140.0,"If you truly feel that way, and it isn’t just you feeling undeserving or wanting to split, maybe consider that you deserve someone who puts equal thought into your traumas! 

It is NOT that you are incompatible. I often feel the same way — I am sometimes hard to relate to, I have a hard time giving empathy when I feel especially rejection sensitive, but most of the time I am in the right mood to give, and oh, how giving I am. There’s a benefit to us who think differently about things...the kind of love and trust we give is a gift. That’s why inconsiderate and narcissistic personality disordered people are often drawn to us. We give a lot of ourselves in relationships, and when that sort of love is presented to the right person, it is a privilege and not an inconvenience.

But if you’re having doubts because you’re scared, and there’s true nurturing and care in your relationship...think about all the little things you can ask for in order to cope ahead rather than having a huge blowout. Ask your partner to understand you in the times that you’re not upset at each other and share your trauma if you’re able. If they love you, they’ll take the time to provide and understand <3 I’m sending you good, healing energy!"
BPD,eyecft3,t1_eyearfw,1567031851.0,"I totally understand that. My current partner is very much the same way... I say something like, “When people raised their voice at me in the past, or spoke to me even in a different tone of voice...” and then my partner immediately says, “Well, I’m not just anyone, I’m your partner! I wish you’d trust me.”

It’s hard to explain that it’s literally hardwired in us now. It may seem logical to them that when you’ve been with someone for at least a few months, trust follows, but there’s a whole lifetime of hurt and flashbacks of past experiences to get through. I try to explain that as gently as I can, because honestly my partner is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with, but sometimes it’s hard to have empathy when I’m so scared all the time. I say, “You’re not the one hurting me. This is my problem, and my memories that are hurting me, but if you speak to me in a soft tone of voice and are perceptive when I tell you that a certain tone bothers me, you can help me get through it. It’s not your fault at all and I love when you help, thank you.” Saying thank you and being appreciative always seems to help :)"
BPD,eydzqhn,t3_cwf0ll,1567026852.0,"I (20F, lesbian) burned my first relationship to the ground (thankfully, it wasn’t a very good one) by not knowing when I was overreacting or entitled to ask a question (i.e. “Hey girlfriend, why do you seem uncomfortable sitting on the couch beside me in front of your mother, who knows that we’re dating? Does this mean that you feel any less intimate towards me?”) and it would get to the point where I had told myself I was overreacting so many times, that my anger at the injustice and miscommunication just...broke through. And then I’d be crying and spiteful towards her rather than able to ask for something that might’ve started as a small request for intimacy or boundaries. Big oops. But our love languages were so different that it was bound to happen. 

I think for people with BPD, we’ve been so conditioned to cope with small injustices for others. So when they happen, we kind of just notice them and internalize the bad feeling they bring, and forget to point it out until it’s a really big problem because we were never really told that we were allowed to bring those uncomfortable and negative things to attention. It’s really hard to notice them right when something seems unfair and to pick that feeling apart from everyday rejection sensitivity. If you feel like something hurts your feelings, and your partner could do something about it without restricting their personal freedom too much (i.e. spending an extra hour with you is okay to ask, giving up their friends for you completely is too toxic of a thing to ask) then go ahead and ask, and trust that they love you enough to either say yes or to say no in the kindest way possible."
Parenting,ey8lbsj,t3_cw4pj5,1566922684.0,"When he brings it up, do you ever ask him how the men in his life expressed love? He might only know roughhousing because his dad/male guardian was afraid to use physical affection/tender play. Maybe it would feel like less of an attack if you acknowledged that he couldn’t help his upbringing and how he came to understand shows of fatherly love, but that he has the power to change it so that it caters to his son’s boundaries and own personal preferences instead. They can play pretend or read together, even if your husband never got to do this with his dad."
BPD,ey2nqwv,t3_cutbq1,1566744135.0,"YES. I was just about to make a DAE about this... 

I cried last night because my partner hasn’t been into sex in a while because of antidepressants killing her sex drive, and she was finally wanting to, and then got too tired and changed her mind at the last moment (obviously understandable, consent is key, and we’d had sex earlier but had to stop because a friend came over). But I was so disappointed because I felt like she was finally going to initiate again. And I’m like you where I don’t even understand my want for it, it’s not like I’m physically driven for it, but I really, emotionally want the validation of being that connected with my partner.

Sometimes the rejection or changing their mind (even though I respect their right to say no at all times) makes me feel like the rest of the time we have sex or they express physical attraction, my partner is pretending to in order to please me but doesn’t really want me to the same degree as if they initiated. I know that’s flawed logic, but is that maybe what you feel too?"
Parenting,ey2l658,t3_cv1xuc,1566742393.0,"No. I feel like his parents’ take on it starts to develop more of an insecure outlook on life, and even perhaps an insecure attachment to others. If you’re a kid and you think that you don’t have a right to use a resource and have to hand it over all the time, you probably develop into an adult who thinks it’s their responsibility to only please others, never expresses needs in a healthy way, and gets really possessive of people or resources because they think it’s bound to get taken away at some point.

You’re doing it right."

You have to soak it ALL the way through the rug, so maybe take it outside and don’t be afraid to pour a ton directly through the rug backing. Maybe even prop the affected spot up on a sawhorse or plywood so you can do this. Then let it dry completely so no chance of mildew. All better!"
Parenting,exzij7w,t1_exzh17w,1566666690.0,"That’s such bull, I come from a less-than-ideal home life and I would say that it makes me more kind and considerate — in a way, you have to get to the top through empathy, or at least having the appearance of caring. And no no, I wasn’t saying that you seemed stuck on the financial part, I just meant that if someone can’t do their share on dates in terms of money, then he certainly should be spoiling her with love and attention, and waiting for her to call the shots when it comes to physical intimacy or else he’s in a position of power over her. No problem, she’ll learn in time!!"
Parenting,exzfs3i,t1_exzf26o,1566665420.0,"Gosh, that sounds terrible. Maybe you’ve raised your daughter so well to be a caring, empathetic person that she’s taken on a “project” person and he’s taking advantage of it. If not financially, because love is certainly not about money, I’d expect him to spoil her at least with attention and not force sex on her as a one-sided expectation. I’m wishing her well!"
Parenting,exzdp71,t3_cutng9,1566664471.0,"Based on things other people have said and correct assumptions they’ve had, sit them both down when they come over and set some friendly ground rules! Say, “I understand that when she’s frustrated with us, she vents to you about things we’ve done wrong, but we are still her parents and love her unconditionally for who she is. When you come over, we expect you to be polite and kind to us and her brothers. We welcome you over here because we want her to be happy, but this is also our home, and we realize that the two of you can’t spend time at your house because you’re less comfortable there — being here is a privilege.” I was going to add something about expecting him to be less manipulative and take her on more dates in nonsexual circumstances, but I guess that’s trying to take away some of her relationship autonomy and treat her less like an adult — maybe suggest to her in private that she asks more of those things from him."
BPD,exu0li0,t3_cudcge,1566577687.0,"One of my problems in my relationship is that I don’t remember to ask for things that would help me cope BEFORE I get upset... I definitely agree with you on being on the “quiet” side which means I suffer in silence, never ask for anything, and then punish other people later when it seems like they didn’t care about what I wanted — they never knew what I wanted in the first place, oops. 

Maybe have small things you ask for when you go over to his house or before sex? Like, “Hey, after your video game is over/after we have sex, will you hold me for like 10 minutes before we do other stuff?” and then remind him again when it’s time. My girlfriend also responds really well and gets really happy when I say thank you and I’m smiley when I receive the thing I wanted — it gives her a little ego boost and makes her feel like a good girlfriend, so don’t forget to say thank you!!

I know that sometimes it doesn’t always work if you don’t remember to ask beforehand and suddenly you’re upset and don’t know why or feel like you can’t control it. I usually feel better if I say, “Hey, it’s not your fault, but I wanted ... and I forgot to ask for it before we did this other thing. Can we make sure we do it later?” and usually hearing that I’ll get it later (versus me thinking that I’ll never get what I want) is enough to calm me and make me feel happy in what we’re doing at the moment :)

I’m so happy for you that you love your boyfriend so much. Best wishes!!"

I think I assumed too that maybe you were comparing your trauma or reactivity to others because this is why I sometimes feel invalid when I ask for help, and then I remember that even neurotypical, not-BPD people seek DBT because it helps them break that tendency in their mind to recognize patterns rather than logic. It is human nature to have a hard time holding multiple truths constant or basing new knowledge on old knowledge! So we all really benefit from it.

Maybe tell your partner that you’re working on this belief, but it helps to have a little emotional boost for it, and once in a while when you’re feeling that way, you could ask him to clasp hands with you for a few moments and make nice eye contact or some other brief show of affection that makes your happy brain hormones spike up and puts your worries to rest. And remember to say thank you to reward him for doing such simple things to make you feel better — it’ll make him happy then, too, so neither of you will feel like this little reassurance is a chore for him."
BPD,exm4qxa,t3_cthizf,1566424500.0,"I ruined a relationship for very similar reasons, I had a hard time accepting disappointments and would get really, really upset, like terrible crying when my partner didn’t give me the affection I was expecting from a situation...

I’m in a different relationship now where I don’t get upset as often or to the same degree, and I realize it was partially because my old partner also had their own problems that made me especially reactive... for instance, she had intimacy issues that caused her to send me mixed signals often and I would interpret some of these as her initiating intimacy or romantic affection, and then I’d be really sad when it turned out she changed her mind halfway without explaining why. She also would get defensive about her tendency to do this and wouldn’t accept my explanation that it hurt me, or truly just could not see that she was doing this often.

My new relationship is more sustainable because I have a partner who doesn’t send mixed messages, explains her intentions most of the time, and when I’m upset, waits for me to comfort myself or offers solutions.

Can you think of any part of your past partner that might’ve been not sustainable for your wants and needs? It helps us get over old relationships when we realize that it’s not black-and-white, and we’re not the only ones who contributed to the emotional rollercoaster that the relationship became. Or, if you think that partner was entirely sustainable and it ended due to issues that you weren’t dealing with on your own, is there any way that you can tell him what you’re working on and let him decide if it’s worth another try?"

Instead of saying, “I’m sorry I was so upset and you had to deal with it,” afterward I say, “Thank you for sitting with me through this tough time, I’m grateful to have you as a friend and I feel a bit better now.” It makes the other person feel really good, too, and reinforces their natural inclinations to show you affection and care!"
