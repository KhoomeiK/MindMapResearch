If it’s found late into pregnancy that the mother’s life is in danger or the fetus is found to have severe and profound defects that are incompatible with life, the mother will usually chose to terminate. The problem is, usually when people relay this information, it’s left out that this was a wanted pregnancy with every intention to carry to term. No one, that’s sane at least, wakes up after 30-32 weeks of pregnancy and decides to have an abortion after all."
