I know you said they’re sister companies, but would this also be a good receiver to have?
Also what subs do you recommend them?"
hometheater,faupyf4,t1_faqwdmj,1576351008.0,yeah but the thing is I already have a home theater room with a 6.1 configuration (although it’s a bad Bose one though) I’m not going to downgrade to stereo after that so I’d rather build a proper 7.1 system. I’m willing to spend more.

hometheater,far23tp,t1_far1e8u,1576311109.0,Do you not a recommend a receiver that has native 11 channels? The amp seems to complicate the set up more. Also I’d prefer to get denon over marantz so what you would recommend in that category?  I’m not sure if I want to get two subs though before I get atmos however.
hometheater,faqyxhm,t1_faqykmd,1576310038.0,"It’s quite an old receiver, I believe from 2004? It doesn’t have support for any modern formats. The Bose Hit is also from the same time.  I was looking at the Denon X3500 as an upgrade, and then upgrade that in the future. I want to do atmos too, in the future I’d want to do a 7.1.4 build. I’m not sure if I  need the 2 surrounds but yeah. Thank you for all the advice btw."
