Small businesses, particularly in rural areas are really suffering at the moment and our area has just dealt with so much from the fires to the floods and it's heartbreaking to watch so many crumble under this pressure.. we hope the community comes together during and after all this because it can hopefully only make us stronger!"

My family's cafe has had to close and we have already been doing it pretty tough, it feels like nothing is worth it anymore and it doesn't feel like we may even be able to reopen the doors when this all blows over. We are feeling very trapped but it's so lovely to know that there are still kind souls out there like you. When I have the ability to I will pay this forward."
