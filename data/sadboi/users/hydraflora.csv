Too bad your psychiatrist can‚Äôt call or FaceTime you. It sounds like you need him/her right now. And no disrespect to your mom but in my opinion you shouldn‚Äôt have to put yourself in the line of fire for her. Especially since you have a form of PTSD, this situation sounds like it‚Äôs not good for your mental health and all the progress you‚Äôve made. Also imagine how empowered your mom might feel if she were able to stand up to your dad herself. But whatever you decide to do please be sure to protect yourself at all costs. And it‚Äôs worth it to reach out to your psychiatrist to see if they can counsel you in some other way, like zoom or FaceTime.

Ndads (and nparents) in general can be so exhausting. Luckily you‚Äôre intelligent and have gotten out from under his mental and physical grip (from what you‚Äôve explained in your original post). You have lots of life ahead. Your mother is lucky to have you but please be careful not to get sucked back in."
raisedbynarcissists,fnwu7jw,t3_g4dscs,1587325533.0,"First of all, good for you. Congrats on achieving your independence and helping your mom. What you‚Äôre attempting to do is a tall feat. It can be done and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre strong enough to do it but you said you‚Äôve never been able to communicate with him on an adult level right? Maybe you should take baby steps? You said you regress and have never been able to have an adult conversation with him. So I think expecting to negotiate your mothers freedom and financial decisions in the very first successful  ‚Äòadult‚Äô conversation might be expecting a lot.

I‚Äôm not trying to be negative at all. I have an ndad myself and it‚Äôs so difficult to be upfront with him when it‚Äôs something he doesn‚Äôt agree with or want to hear. You might not have the time for baby steps as you‚Äôre trying to get your mother away from him but if you do I would recommend you try and deal with one issue at a time so you can ‚Äòpractice‚Äô talking to him. 

Ugh I‚Äôm sorry you have to deal with him. And it sounds like you done a great job working on yourself. And now advocating for your mom. You said your psychiatrist recommends you go no contact? Are you considering that after you get your mom out of there? 

Good luck. Remember he‚Äôs the problem, not you.

Edit: on second thought maybe taking baby steps  is bad advice because then you‚Äôll have to have several conversations with him instead of one. Can you rehearse what you‚Äôd say with your psychiatrist and have somewhat scripted responses to trigger words and statements? That might be the best way to go on second thought."

lyftdrivers,fha5v0s,t3_f23d54,1581398076.0,"How defeating. I‚Äôm sorry about that. If you have the flexibility you should quit Lyft. I feel like they‚Äôre taking advantage of people that desperately need money. Why else would one drive for them?

I signed up as a driver for Uber and Lyft and only drove one day for 2 hours for Lyft and it just didn‚Äôt make sense financially. 

I was banking on the fact that my car happens to be a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù or ‚Äúluxury‚Äù vehicle but AFTER I went through the hiring process Uber said they weren‚Äôt accepting any select (or black?) drivers and there isn‚Äôt ANY demand on Lyft. So it ends up that driving for either is more of a liability for me than anything else. Is their mileage rate supposed to be so close to the state‚Äôs mileage rate? In CA it‚Äôs .575 cents but I thought that Lyft & Uber would offer a much higher rate because it‚Äôs a little different than running errands in your personal car for your job. When you drive for Uber/Lyft your vehicle is what allows you to do your job. Insane. 

I still beat myself up though and tell myself I should drive because I have the time and need money but I feel like a fool working for that amount of money. And then I have this whole internal argument about pride and letting my ego get in the way of doing what I need to do. But again I feel that pay rate is BS.

That‚Äôs the problem. It‚Äôs perfectly fine to be curious and ask questions but so many people are tone deaf.

Luckily the older I get the less it bothers me. But apparently there‚Äôs still some buried rage lol.

Most people: Do you ever straighten it? How much longer is it?

Me: 




But that might not be exactly what you‚Äôre referring to. I‚Äôm just going off on an angry tangent. It just bugs me that wearing your hair curly is viewed as being undone or something to be fixed, not proper. 

I had an ex boyfriend that had never seen me with my hair straightened because I simply think I look better with my curly hair, so I don‚Äôt do it. When we‚Äôd have conversations, and it could be about anything, he‚Äôd find a way to work in his obsession with seeing me with straightened hair. 

Like WTF? You know what makes me not nice? People‚Äôs non relenting desire for me to tame my huge head of beautiful, thick, shiny, potpourri smelling, curly-ness! Give it a rest already! But for example, I‚Äôd bring up some past event in my life like let‚Äôs say a graduation. And he‚Äôd ask, ‚Äúdid you straighten your hair for that?‚Äù  No! Or if there was an upcoming event. ‚ÄúYou should straighten your hair!‚Äù Come on! How about I suggest he texturizes his hair, and gets some 360 waves? I wouldn‚Äôt! Because I wouldn‚Äôt condescend someone like that. 

So that felt good. I know I‚Äôm being over the top. But I had to speak on that. And I do sincerely think I look better with my natural hair."

BravoRealHousewives,f0zdey2,t1_f0zc458,1569092626.0,Then isn‚Äôt it NOT surprising that someone like Joe is being treated like this? With all that‚Äôs going on with immigration and all the other charges you stated above?
nostalgia,f0z1bsm,t1_f0xeuld,1569083928.0,Haha same here! That‚Äôs why I love this sub
nostalgia,f0z11yq,t3_d7bo0p,1569083729.0,"Charleston chew is chewy gooey, but not too chewy!

Did I remember that correctly?"
BravoRealHousewives,f0z0wig,t1_f0y58mb,1569083617.0,"It‚Äôs kind of shocking that with all the issues going on with immigrants today, that someone like Joe is being treated like this.

What do you mean exactly? Sincere question."
raisedbynarcissists,f0z05fe,t3_d7ces3,1569083075.0,"Awww, try not to be so hard on yourself. Like you said, hitting was the only recourse you knew. And I‚Äôm sorry you experienced all that trauma as a child. If you are seeing a therapist tell them. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre for. And they‚Äôve heard it all, so no need to be embarrassed about it."
legaladvice,f0yzvty,t3_d7cfcn,1569082882.0,"You would think that she would have some type of insurance on the property? Maybe? If so, you‚Äôd only pay the deductible (assuming it‚Äôs less than the cost). Otherwise get your own estimates on the gate. Pain in the ass, I know. Maybe a gate ‚Äúexpert‚Äù could prove your point that it doesn‚Äôt need to be replaced. But that‚Äôs A LOT of money for what you‚Äôre describing."
BravoRealHousewives,f0n2qrf,t3_d5m6nv,1568759016.0,"I liked it, full of drama but it wasn‚Äôt cringey to me. But it does remind me of how my mom would tell me I looked and sounded like a cow when I chewed gum as a kid. It was so annoying back then but I‚Äôm thanking her as I watch Nene in the beginning of this interview üò¨"
BravoRealHousewives,f0n2jur,t1_f0mz2ex,1568758877.0,Me too lol. I guess I signed up for shitpost alerts and don‚Äôt remember. üòâ
nostalgia,f0kga3f,t3_d4e6vd,1568678839.0,"Thanks for posting that. Brings me back to waiting and waiting for the Muppets to come on and watch with my dad. It came on during prime time too, hardly any kids shows were on prime time, so it was a huge treat."
BravoRealHousewives,eztxiwd,t1_eztm1kg,1568140872.0,"I wish 3 million bought a palace in LA. More like a decent house in the hills or 2k sq feet by the beach. But definitely cheaper than Manhattan.

And then it seems that people that live in Manhattan ‚Äúneed‚Äù a 2nd house somewhere with some space like the Hamptons, Shelter Island etc. to spend the summer. So you truly need to be paid to live that lifestyle."
OldSchoolCool,ez1kf67,t1_ez1iwih,1567648516.0,"Exactly! I remember the sound of that thing closing with the extra flap that went over the play, stop etc. buttons."
nostalgia,eyy06oc,t1_eytrm65,1567567272.0,Yeah my older sister would put her hip hop tapes in and I would cry because I thought he was gonna break.

Sneakers,eytknaz,t3_cyqm0y,1567439031.0,Yeah dope!
BravoRealHousewives,ey5gl2s,t3_cvegpy,1566831133.0,Oh okay. From the way it‚Äôs cropped it was hard to tell. Thx
BravoRealHousewives,ey4rp07,t3_cvegpy,1566804540.0,What in the Dunkin‚Äô Donuts is she sitting in?
