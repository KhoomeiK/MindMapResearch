raisedbynarcissists,fnxl6pi,t3_g4dscs,1587340941.0,"What does your dad call you? I can’t translate 😉. I’m sure he knows he’s pushing your buttons though. Too bad your psychiatrist can’t call or FaceTime you. It sounds like you need him/her right now. And no disrespect to your mom but in my opinion you shouldn’t have to put yourself in the line of fire for her. Especially since you have a form of PTSD, this situation sounds like it’s not good for your mental health and all the progress you’ve made. Also imagine how empowered your mom might feel if she were able to stand up to your dad herself. But whatever you decide to do please be sure to protect yourself at all costs. And it’s worth it to reach out to your psychiatrist to see if they can counsel you in some other way, like zoom or FaceTime.

Ndads (and nparents) in general can be so exhausting. Luckily you’re intelligent and have gotten out from under his mental and physical grip (from what you’ve explained in your original post). You have lots of life ahead. Your mother is lucky to have you but please be careful not to get sucked back in."
raisedbynarcissists,fnwu7jw,t3_g4dscs,1587325533.0,"First of all, good for you. Congrats on achieving your independence and helping your mom. What you’re attempting to do is a tall feat. It can be done and I’m sure you’re strong enough to do it but you said you’ve never been able to communicate with him on an adult level right? Maybe you should take baby steps? You said you regress and have never been able to have an adult conversation with him. So I think expecting to negotiate your mothers freedom and financial decisions in the very first successful  ‘adult’ conversation might be expecting a lot.

I’m not trying to be negative at all. I have an ndad myself and it’s so difficult to be upfront with him when it’s something he doesn’t agree with or want to hear. You might not have the time for baby steps as you’re trying to get your mother away from him but if you do I would recommend you try and deal with one issue at a time so you can ‘practice’ talking to him. 

Ugh I’m sorry you have to deal with him. And it sounds like you done a great job working on yourself. And now advocating for your mom. You said your psychiatrist recommends you go no contact? Are you considering that after you get your mom out of there? 

Good luck. Remember he’s the problem, not you.

Edit: on second thought maybe taking baby steps  is bad advice because then you’ll have to have several conversations with him instead of one. Can you rehearse what you’d say with your psychiatrist and have somewhat scripted responses to trigger words and statements? That might be the best way to go on second thought."

And I didn’t know she was a figure skating coach. That sounds very interesting to me. When he asked her about her day and she was talking about work I couldn’t believe he didn’t have ANY questions, especially as a trainer. Seemed like a missed opportunity for some good conversation to me."
lyftdrivers,fha5v0s,t3_f23d54,1581398076.0,"How defeating. I’m sorry about that. If you have the flexibility you should quit Lyft. I feel like they’re taking advantage of people that desperately need money. Why else would one drive for them?

I signed up as a driver for Uber and Lyft and only drove one day for 2 hours for Lyft and it just didn’t make sense financially. 

I was banking on the fact that my car happens to be a “premium” or “luxury” vehicle but AFTER I went through the hiring process Uber said they weren’t accepting any select (or black?) drivers and there isn’t ANY demand on Lyft. So it ends up that driving for either is more of a liability for me than anything else. Is their mileage rate supposed to be so close to the state’s mileage rate? In CA it’s .575 cents but I thought that Lyft & Uber would offer a much higher rate because it’s a little different than running errands in your personal car for your job. When you drive for Uber/Lyft your vehicle is what allows you to do your job. Insane. 

I still beat myself up though and tell myself I should drive because I have the time and need money but I feel like a fool working for that amount of money. And then I have this whole internal argument about pride and letting my ego get in the way of doing what I need to do. But again I feel that pay rate is BS.

curlyhair,fcokwl3,t1_fcmd2u1,1577834812.0,"But our big hair is always a good topic of conversation. Like anything else that’s different.  /s

That’s the problem. It’s perfectly fine to be curious and ask questions but so many people are tone deaf. And it’s not my responsibility to compensate for their lack of social decorum (to say the least). So I handle it on a case by case basis. Sometimes I’m good at gracefully schooling people, other times I’m not. I wish I was better at it though. 

Luckily the older I get the less it bothers me. But apparently there’s still some buried rage lol. 

And I suppose it’s as you said OP, the passive aggressive remarks and all around culture (is that the right word?) that points to my type of hair as being the type thats inherently damaged, dry, or in need of repair. Products for fine hair don’t usually say that they’re grease deterring or that they fight stringy-ness. Know what I mean?

But on a positive note I do love my hair now and I really wish I started to appreciate it much earlier on."
curlyhair,fcm640o,t3_ehw7e2,1577765202.0,"I hate that so-called compliments regarding my hair basically go like this. 

Most people (when/if they give me a “compliment”):  I love your hair.

Me: Thanks

Most people: Do you ever straighten it? How much longer is it?

Me: 




But that might not be exactly what you’re referring to. I’m just going off on an angry tangent. It just bugs me that wearing your hair curly is viewed as being undone or something to be fixed, not proper. 

I had an ex boyfriend that had never seen me with my hair straightened because I simply think I look better with my curly hair, so I don’t do it. When we’d have conversations, and it could be about anything, he’d find a way to work in his obsession with seeing me with straightened hair. 

Like WTF? You know what makes me not nice? People’s non relenting desire for me to tame my huge head of beautiful, thick, shiny, potpourri smelling, curly-ness! Give it a rest already! But for example, I’d bring up some past event in my life like let’s say a graduation. And he’d ask, “did you straighten your hair for that?”  No! Or if there was an upcoming event. “You should straighten your hair!” Come on! How about I suggest he texturizes his hair, and gets some 360 waves? I wouldn’t! Because I wouldn’t condescend someone like that. 

So that felt good. I know I’m being over the top. But I had to speak on that. And I do sincerely think I look better with my natural hair."

And I’m sorry you experienced all that trauma as a child. If you are seeing a therapist tell them. That’s what they’re for. And they’ve heard it all, so no need to be embarrassed about it."
legaladvice,f0yzvty,t3_d7cfcn,1569082882.0,"You would think that she would have some type of insurance on the property? Maybe? If so, you’d only pay the deductible (assuming it’s less than the cost). Otherwise get your own estimates on the gate. Pain in the ass, I know. Maybe a gate “expert” could prove your point that it doesn’t need to be replaced. But that’s A LOT of money for what you’re describing."
BravoRealHousewives,f0n2qrf,t3_d5m6nv,1568759016.0,"I liked it, full of drama but it wasn’t cringey to me. But it does remind me of how my mom would tell me I looked and sounded like a cow when I chewed gum as a kid. It was so annoying back then but I’m thanking her as I watch Nene in the beginning of this interview 😬"
BravoRealHousewives,f0n2jur,t1_f0mz2ex,1568758877.0,Me too lol. I guess I signed up for shitpost alerts and don’t remember. 😉
nostalgia,f0kga3f,t3_d4e6vd,1568678839.0,"Thanks for posting that. Brings me back to waiting and waiting for the Muppets to come on and watch with my dad. It came on during prime time too, hardly any kids shows were on prime time, so it was a huge treat."
BravoRealHousewives,eztxiwd,t1_eztm1kg,1568140872.0,"I wish 3 million bought a palace in LA. More like a decent house in the hills or 2k sq feet by the beach. But definitely cheaper than Manhattan.

And then it seems that people that live in Manhattan “need” a 2nd house somewhere with some space like the Hamptons, Shelter Island etc. to spend the summer. So you truly need to be paid to live that lifestyle."
OldSchoolCool,ez1kf67,t1_ez1iwih,1567648516.0,"Exactly! I remember the sound of that thing closing with the extra flap that went over the play, stop etc. buttons."
nostalgia,eyy06oc,t1_eytrm65,1567567272.0,Yeah my older sister would put her hip hop tapes in and I would cry because I thought he was gonna break.

Sneakers,eytknaz,t3_cyqm0y,1567439031.0,Yeah dope!
BravoRealHousewives,ey5gl2s,t3_cvegpy,1566831133.0,Oh okay. From the way it’s cropped it was hard to tell. Thx
BravoRealHousewives,ey4rp07,t3_cvegpy,1566804540.0,What in the Dunkin’ Donuts is she sitting in?
