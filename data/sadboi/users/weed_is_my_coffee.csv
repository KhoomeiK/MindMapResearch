I know it sounds crazy. Why would I pray for her when she‚Äôs mean to me?? It‚Äôs not for her. It‚Äôs for you. It will help you to forgive her which will set you free. Good luck :)

hairstylist,fm9rcb2,t3_ftr9w3,1585874825.0,"To achieve silver/grey the hair has to be void of all pigment. Bleach up to palest yellow, pretone to remove yellow undertones and then apply shadow root and then lighter color to midshaft and ends. It's a difficult high maintenance color. Anytime you have to prelighten with bleach you MUST come in every 4 weeks for a root touch-up otherwise it turns into corrective color AKA expensive. Good luck üëç"

hairstylist,fl61x4g,t3_fmtrmd,1584851876.0,"There's a couple of issues going on here
1 Box dye is a one size fits all and that's not how to formulate color properly
2 We don't know what volume peroxide is in box dye
3 The volume peroxide you use is crucial for many reasons, one of them being; using the wrong volume peroxide results in breaking down the hair over time and making it overly porous which will result in color fadage
Ideally you would create one formula for the regrowth and another formula to brighten up/refresh the ends depending on fadage. 
Hope this helps :)"
