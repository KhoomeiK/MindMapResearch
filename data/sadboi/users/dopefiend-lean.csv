Antipsychiatry,fql735h,t3_gjf767,1589448548.0,I feel like people who seek out a career in the field of psychiatry and possibly to a lesser extent psychology are doing this for reasons that are more selfish than altruistic.

radicalmentalhealth,fql6d2a,t3_gjg57z,1589447819.0,I'm currently using psilocybin mushrooms to treat medication resistant mental health issues with better success than I ever had in 25 years of psychiatry. I always knew there were healing powers associated with certain psychedelic substances from recreational use in my younger years. I had sort of grown out of taking any of it I felt like so for 20 years I never touched them. I had developed fear especially for LSD after having a harsh time the last time I used it. So even after I started seeing these new studies showing amazing potential I was glad for others but I was too fearful personally. Eventually my pain exceeded my fear and I reached out to some folks I know and procured psilocybe cubensis mushrooms golden teacher strain. The results have been absolutely life changing to put it mildly. I definitely came in with caution. I started off nice and slow and although for me I don't just micro-dose I take significantly higher doses because for me it works better. I envision a day in the not too distant future where real and true relief is widely available to all. I only hope the powers that be don't make this an impossible outcome. Time will tell.
Methadone,fql3inh,t3_giw6q3,1589444975.0,There's nothing weak about asking for help. Best of luck.
Antipsychiatry,fql3dw9,t1_fqkc5bn,1589444847.0,Yeah I know from experience that many of the people who work in these facilities view the patient as an annoyance and I can imagine they are not always careful about cross contamination. Yeah I can't see how this would make a good option unless it was literally the only way to keep someone alive. Good thing for me I know all the things that I cannot say if I expect to keep the armed goons from dragging me away at gunpoint and locking me up against my will without a single crime being committed.
Methadone,fql0sm0,t1_fqj2kxy,1589442342.0,I agree completely. The tendency for the vast majority of methadone clients is to accept any new rules or policy changes without question. I realize that many people are not always in full compliance in ways such as having lots of dirty drug screens and benzo history and going up against the clinic seems like a good way to get thrown off. I have been this way at times and I know you just want to keep your head down so I get it. Then you have people who are working multiple jobs and raising kids or whatever and just don't have time to get into it. I understand but this is how they can get away with the shit they pull and they are well aware of it. Just like how they will change certain policies but only for those who fight them when obviously it should change across the board. It's tyrannical by design. Unfortunately I have come to the conclusion that over time things are going to get worse and not better. We need strong and effective advocacy.
Methadone,fqiurua,t1_fqh83e0,1589401165.0,"Well you surely wouldn't think they could get away with making people miss dosings due to policy but in my experience they do whatever they want to do. Rarely have I seen people stand up to them by even filing a greivance form much less getting representation from a patient advocate or going straight to whatever oversight organization is available. I have been on 4 different clinics over the years and I have seen them ignore federal regulations and the HIPPA Laws especially. I am not one to be trifled with because I seek out the information I need to see if they are within regulations if I feel like they are trying to pull some bullshit on me and it's at the point now they hardly even bother but it's not like that with most people. For instance my clinic has some new policies that are questionable at best and so I took them to task. One policy in particular is now for every 5mg increase of dose we have to have a separate Doctor visit. This is so they can maximize billing. I made them aware I was ready to fight this all the way up the ladder and they quickly came back to me and this was the solution.... they made it so it doesn't apply to me. Yeah just me. Everyone else is still under this bullshit, hardship inducing, withdrawals extending policy. So with all I have seen them do or try to get away with I put nothing past them.
For the record when I see someone going through and having to deal with this particular policy I contact them and tell them how they can get around it. I don't have time to fight this policy for everyone as much as I wish I could but my rent and other bills sadly have to come first. If I was in a position to help in a meaningful way I would."
microdosing,fqfjq9k,t1_fqffwtg,1589326137.0,"Yeah but for whatever reason you use these compounds for doesn't mean you get to judge people who take it for another reason. Rigid thinking is what causes problems. Recreational use of these substances in my younger years is how I came to know about the amazing healing power they hold and sure I think it's more noble to trip for healing or spiritual reasons the fact remains there will always be people who take these for recreational purposes because guess what..?? They actually can be extremely FUN. Chill out man, to each his own... live and let live."

microdosing,fqfi07v,t3_gihc2h,1589325240.0,This was nothing more than someone cashing in on the recent popularity of psychedelics in the mainstream. Honestly I couldn't even finish it.

Psychonaut,fqfgu77,t3_gij1nt,1589324637.0,I agree this documentary is nothing more than pop-culture. I feel like it's a group of people who have noticed the recent trend of acceptance of psychedelics in the mainstream culture and this is the result of their attempt to cash in. It certainly plays that way to me. It comes off as disingenuous. Plus we all know by now that Netflix will greenlight pretty much anything they are presented with so I think I can see it for exactly what it is. I imagine there will be more to come unfortunately and the powers that be are so threatened by psychedelics and the potential to transform society in such a way that they lose their grip of control I expect them to find a way to demonize these compounds with Media propaganda and possibly even staging false events that will be blamed on psychedelics. History plainly shows how they react when they don't have their boot planted firmly on the back of your neck.

I just see how common it seems to be on the forums I partake in and so yes from my perspective I feel like there's definitely a reason for the more is always better feeling that seems so prevalent.

I'm in the middle of finding what works best for me and I can say from experience that I definitely started out with more than I needed and I am finding things are getting much better as I move to smaller amounts but it's funny I am still reluctant because the thought of more is better is so ingrained...go figure.

This man according to OP has mental health issues and I happen to know for a fact that these things can be so intensive and cause one to suffer to such a degree as to become so desperate for relief that all rational thought goes out the window. Before you all drag this man to the gallows and hang him by the neck until dead.... without allowing him to defend himself I might add... maybe you should consider this situation may have more than meets the eye.

Psychonaut,fq98gc8,t1_fq97lbf,1589189383.0,"I feel like I should add something for the record. Yes, as a longtime psychedelic experiencer who has experienced catastrophic ego death myself and has admittedly also used these compounds for recreational use at least many years ago I can see how it looks. Alternatively I am also a sufferer of mental health issues and I know first-hand just how urgent it can be to need healing at almost any cost. This man likely had no malicious intent and was simply desperate for relief and not capable of rational thought. In fact I also must admit not being unbiased here myself only from a standpoint of desperation and need of healing. 
 Thankfully I myself have respect for these compounds and if I am totally honest LSD for me was taken off the table long ago as I find it too easy to go off the rails so to speak with that particular subsance. At any rate I wish everyone involved the very best. Thank you."
Psychonaut,fq97lbf,t1_fq7n9pa,1589188475.0,"Look I'm more looking at this from an angle of seeing this guy basically ""convicted in the Media"". Can we agree that all information given so far has come from one person who is in the situation themselves and therefore cannot be taken as an objective or unbiased party?
  I will admit it definitely looks like the guy did pretty much everything wrong and was selfish and reckless to say the least. At the same time I must force myself to remember that I have only been privy to what is one viewpoint of the situation and this person being emotionally involved is most definitely biased. The original post is written in from a ""victim"" point of view to a startling degree, in fact this comes off as being more a tale of ""woe is me"" and please give me support against this foul act done to me.
    Even if factually accurate it reads in such a way as to have everyone ready to hang this guy without being bothered to allow him to defend himself. It's a witch hunt and I am a little astounded at just how well it worked. Thank you for at least taking a minute or two to look at this from a different position."
Psychonaut,fq71yih,t1_fq6ol6n,1589140740.0,If the same judgement you use on this guy was turned on you especially on nothing but hearsay I guarantee you would call it unfair. This is the problem with Media... people have been trained and programmed to get one biased side of any story and automatically count it all as gospel truth. This is why the few can so easily rule and manipulate the masses. Critical thought has been washed away.
Psychonaut,fq70z6q,t1_fq6m63d,1589140378.0,Exactly. You will never get the full story without both sides. People should not be so quick to jump on the bandwagon and judge plus convict this guy without his being able to defend himself and offer his side of the situation.

radicalmentalhealth,fpztiz7,t1_fpwri8t,1589023410.0,Key is remember that many people have treatment resistant illness and many of the side effects of some of these meds are terrible and often outweigh any positive response. Blaming the patient is just plain ignorant when used as a generalization. Sure there's lazy people that won't take meds correctly but I'm sure this applies to many meds that have nothing to do with psychiatry or mental conditions... antibiotics comes to mind...Look into the history of psychiatry if you want something to blame people for and even current legal maneuvers that cause people to be taken into a psychiatric hospital or facility by armed police officers and forced to remain there indefinitely without having to first harm any person or personal property or having any sort of due process to challenge this procedure.

It pays to take some time and look into the rules in your specific area and rules that are basically standard across state lines or other boundaries.

It didn't matter if I stopped at a place I had never eaten before in my life, or if I bought groceries. My mind had very plausible explanations of how they could always manage to make sure whatever I got my hands on no matter how they made it happen.

Not sure if it's State law or Federal which would apply across the entire U.S. I live in N.Carolina wherever you are you can easily look up your various rights and laws/ legislation that would affect you in your area. The 72 hour law basically says at any point once you are delivered to the hospital/facility you can request a form that you dispute the validity of your being held. Once you sign that form they have no choice but to let you leave exactly 72 hours after you sign that form. Under different criteria of the circumstances that brought you in is a different law that works pretty much the same way except it lasts 7 days. Now once you sign the form you can refuse to participate in any session or medical examination besides the 3 a day vitals. Be aware that if you say anything in those 3 days or 7 days depending which law you fall under they may be able to use it against you and keep you anyway. Talking about suicidal thoughts or voices telling you to hurt someone are commonly used successfully to keep you. Also requests for medication can be used for the same purpose. You say you have been held on these involuntary psych holds on more than one occasion, well to me that means it is very, very important that you learn all you can about the legal aspect of these ""holds"" and also the rights you have in this specific situation. I say this because I know from experience they won't necessarily lie but they won't make you aware of the various protections that exist. They can be quite deceptive without actually lying, that being said I have also been told bold face lies. It's the same way with police when you are ""on the street"" if you don't know your rights they can get away with quite a lot. Take some time, download the PDF files of the Federal and State laws, find them with a Google search. And learn how to effectively combat this violation of your freedom. Over the years I have learned that they use deception and trickery to make you believe your only option is to comply but I promise you there are protections built in for people who may have been detained due to lies told against you or this power has been used as a means of punishment because you pissed off the cops or any number of ways this can be done to you in appropriately. There is actually a page or 2 in your paperwork that will advise you of certain rights but it seems to me that it is worded in such a way as to be confusing and I know for me personally when I wind up in this situation I am probably not doing my best thinking and you go over so many papers they have you sign it's easy for them to sort of gloss over the helpful information. It is truly like a game...who can use the system better, you or them. Don't sign anything just because they say you have to because if you really had to they wouldn't need the paperwork anyway. If it's overly confusing there's usually a reason for it my advice don't sign anything you don't understand. Every signature you give you waive a right or protection or you give them permission to do something. You can figure it all out and when you do there's not gonna be any more stays longer than 7 days max."
depressed,fn9ja63,t1_fn8hdex,1586775152.0,"Obsidianknightlight, i have a question. I have had trauma from a long time ago and this may be a stupid question but just how exactly does one go about ""facing it""? I only ask because I know there is a potential for real healing. At the wellness center where I receive various services related to mental illness i have a counselor, not exactly sure what credentials she holds but there's several letters after her name so its substantial, oh but she is not the psychiatrist. This being said I have tried to address this trauma with her assistance but I was her very first patient and this is her first job after finishing her schooling. I have been seeing various versions of counselor/therapist people for many years so I feel confident in saying she is completely clueless as to how to help me process this trauma. Only recently have i even been able to bring it up at all much less be willing to really get into it and there's no guarantee that I won't become unwilling again to acknowledge it or work on it. I know it still strongly affects me and I truly believe if I could address it in the proper manner i could really benefit. Any thoughts or insight would be greatly appreciated. My situation is such that the longer i go on without something getting better the bigger the chance for me to have very serious negative events that carry major consequences occur."
depressed,fn9ibp8,t3_g0a1vo,1586774109.0,"For myself when my depression is really dug in its literally impossible for me to even think on that level. I get so utterly hopeless and overwhelmed that most times the very best i can do is put off suicide for another day,minute, second...whatever. It goes so far beyond deep sadness i end up unable to function even in many basic ways. My mental illness moves all over the spectrum. I am diagnosed MDD(major depressive), OCD, panic disorder, mood disorder, and schizo-affective. Chronic pretty much life long suffering. The only upside i can see from having a condition that changes sporadically is that given enough time the depression will either lift or morph into something else. I want to say please don't kill yourself, i know how unbearable it can get and how it can seem like the only path to relief but if you really think about it life is so short anyway its gonna be over soon enough so if at all possible i will not doom my eternal soul. Wether you hold any religious beliefs or not it still goes by so fast i just can't see actually going through with it. Even though when I am in the throes of it this is not how i see it, or actually its an Internal struggle going back and forth. Best of luck to you, they say the sun eventually shines on every dog's behind and today I believe that statement. Carry on and keep fighting the good fight!"

Finally someone who can see through the bullshit like myself and is strongly against so called authorities ability to have you locked up against your will without due process or any crime ever being committed. And I see you know how mentioning certain urges/plans causes the legal requirements that prolong your detention and makes getting out a more complicated process. Psychiatry is junk science, look into how it was in the beginning. It will absolutely blow your mind. And although the propaganda makes many believe the practice has made great strides over the years and the brain is well understood as far as mental illness is concerned. I've done my homework and i am not impressed in the least. Diagnosis is calculated from input of the patient which can be deceptive, delusional, or just something ridiculous they felt like telling you to amuse themselves. Yup...science."

Although recent trends are ""wellness center"" type of operations that consists of psychiatric visit, individual counseling, case work, therapy or psychology access, certain specialized treatment options on-site as well such as Electro Convulsive Therapy...and that last one should give you a little insight into wether any real progress is being made in the practice at all. One more thing that depending on your particular case may be offered which is peer support groups. It on the surface looks like a innovative concept but I suspect it's motive is more of a billing ""free for all"" Because trust me i know from experience you get a separate bill for each and every aspect of the program you use and none of it is cheap."

Im like you I have yet to meet a single psychiatrist who actually put in the work to be most sure of what treatment program I would benefit from. I have had no choice but to find my own ways to medicate myself with things that not only work, they work damn well and are immediately effective, no 6-8 weeks just to see if you can tell a difference."

I know what you can or should say and i know what information if shared by me to them binds them to legal requirements that would almost always be disagreeable to myself. It's sort of a shame because actually when i have a psychotic break and have to be involuntarily committed i could actually benefit from some help but to access this assistance i have to allow my stay to be a significantly longer time, and am then required to go through an enormous battery of medical tests being poked and jabbed and prodded and more freedoms i am required to sign away and legally speaking they could keep you held against your will indefinitely if certain criteria are observed with respect to your particular case.

Sadly i never found one single enthusiastic psychiatrist, they all seemed to act as if patients were basically just a nuisance. Once or twice i was fortunate enough to have a P.A. on my case that actually cared that my life was being spent suffering from mental illness and I had nobody in my corner, at least medical professionals who were charging top dollar for me to come in while they acted bored/annoyed by me. I am always polite and not full of aggression and hostility at least until months have passed as I've suffered every single day to what felt to me to be a ridiculous degree and the people well paid to address this issue with me and offer some help. Eventually I grow hostile and aggressive with them and make remarks of how i will surely go out in a blaze of gunfire as I walk through office after office murdering those who instead of helping me could not be bothered to do this job they are paid so well for. Sorry for this but it's what kind of mindset i end up with every time. Truth is in my heart i don't want anyone to hurt and I don't want to inflict violence on anyone it's just a way that I feel may convey just how much i suffer and just how bad things are for me."
schizophrenia,fn6rnuq,t1_fn6luel,1586705989.0,"For me they almost always ask me what has worked in the past and ask me if I want to try it again.

And when I ask for their educated, professional opinion I almost always still feel slighted like they pretty much say well you know what has worked for you in the past so it's really up to you... So i feel like they aren't even concerned enough or have any passion to actually excel in their chosen profession by actually being thorough about your particular case and offering you the solution that will likely bring you some relief and allow you to stop the endless suffering at least to some degree.

mentalillness,fn6bcjw,t3_fzrmbw,1586694338.0,"I took the time, bought in, and began a years long quest of trying drug after drug, combo of drugs after combos... I followed the advice given to the absolute best of my ability. I had not yet come to understand that my illness which is subject to move all over the spectrum at will was/is medication/treatment resistant. So I took the advice of the professional people in charge of my case, Psychiatrist, Therapist, etc. But yes I do in fact have an answer as to what is one particular option when you simply cannot endure your illness and following medical advice didn't pan out for you. When you have nowhere left to turn you could do as many of us do to various degrees. Turn to ""recreational"" plants, fungi, and outright drugs the vast majority are illegal because it's against the law to take something that will make you feel better. This is one of the more hurtful consequences of some humans having ""authority"" to absolutely obliterate your life for the ""crime"" of putting a substance in your system in order to feel better, regardless if you are completely nonviolent, never steal or rob or otherwise cause harm to an individual or personal property. Of course there are certain items on the list that tend to breed violence and crime but not all drugs fall into this category. I know i got off on a tangent there but it just makes me so frustrated to know that the governments of the world can manufacture support and consent to even the most ridiculous and tyrannical ideas. Anyway I will move on lest i be lost down the rabbit hole. 
       My point is that for me..drugs is the hands down number one most effective means of managing symptoms and they function immediately, no 6-8 weeks wait and see while you are dying inside waiting for relief that in my case never came. The new med rollercoaster from hell while you hold on for dear life and get your hopes up high only to have them dashed before restarting the process over and over for sometimes years. For those of you who have lived it you know just how utterly defeating this can be. I won't actually condone illegal drug use or advise any specific person to try this option i will simply state that for me this was absolutely a life saver, literally. A chance to enjoy some real and true relief from this debilitating and stigmatized condition. Even beyond that actually enjoying life. Which is no small feat at least in my case. I must admit it can get tricky, it can get out of hand, can cause serious legal trouble, harm relationships and employment situations. I had to learn over several years how to be smart about engaging in this form of relief, what works for what issues, what should never be taken for any reason whatsoever, and the list goes on. It is a very complex process to do this successfully and there's always more that needs to be learned. At this point in life i have found a way for the most part of treating myself, enjoying myself, and keeping life more or less manageable. It was just my only viable option and it was either find a means of relief or commit suicide. I could NOT endure my life in the state of psychosis, despair, agony i continued to find myself in. It was literally life and death."
mentalillness,fn68ixy,t1_fn5tpeo,1586691549.0,"Problem is in my personal experience the ""help"" wasn't much help at all. Even in the extremely rare cases of finding a drug combo that actually worked and rid me of psychosis and other hard to manage factors they still did not change the fact that im crazy. Life was still difficult to navigate and people could still tell im not quite right in the head. Plus as i was essentially turning over my care and my life to the practice of psychiatry i decided to research the history thereof. Well that's a story of a nightmare in real life for a great many early patients. And even in the current era there is much that is not known about just exactly how some of the drugs interact with the brain to bring about the desired results. Truth is almost every psychiatric drug on the market can have adverse effects and make a person suicidal for instance or trigger manic episodes that can be super powered for lack of a better term. I know cuz these things happened to me...   can't say with 100% surety it was not just my mental illness and not the medications but take my word for it the meds brought extremely undesirable results to my life that came with serious legal trouble and helped me to injure relationships that were long-standing and very important. I know my story does not represent the vast majority of cases but i believe there's a more than significant percentage of people finding it was the 2nd most terrible option. I truly hope anyone reading this or loved ones etc has positive experiences and gets the life changing benefits we all hear of. Be safe and God bless."

This makes me without casting judgement just simply happy that this is the case. For myself and many others it is simply not the magic bullet some would have you believe. But when you take into account the absolute nightmare that this practice embraced in the beginning i don't see how anyone could ever have a notion that this has no bearing on psychiatry in the current era. If you are not aware of the incredibly nightmarish history of the practice and the beginnings i would implore you to educate yourself. Truth is always welcome right..??

 Yes, as far as I can see that statement is 100% true. But answer me this.... Just because there are multitudes of people seeking help in this regard doesn't necessarily mean they are getting adequate help. For me personally it took years for me to determine that my illness is medication resistant in many ways and even when I do find that combo that actually works it is only to a minute percentage of my illness as a whole, so it's either not effective at all, or it's i guess around 10% effective but comes with what I consider to be enough negative side effects as to make it not worth the trade-off. For all those who are receiving care that actually works for you and works well I can only say i thank God and i am completely supportive of sticking with what actually works for you. Count yourself lucky because it doesn't pan-out that way for all of us. Yes at the end of the day it would be SO WONDERFUL i could overlook the ""sins of the past""."

My illness has always been medication resistant except for mind expansion substances which works immediately and lasts for months and far better than anything provided by ""big pharma"" and without horrible side-effects.

       I say that to say this...   She's a fairly recent graduate and pretty new to the therapy game. I was/am her very first client when she took her first position in the field upon receiving her degrees. She personally (probably for professional reasons) has never admitted to taking psychedelic substances but I feel like either she has been educated to some degree about psychedelics or has actual, first hand experience. Whichever or whatever the case may be the end result is I can bring it up, speak to the healing I feel like I have been granted by my psilocybin use and not for the first second be met with judgement. Actually it's a subject that she always asks many questions and she has even told me ""off the record"" that if I maintain a dosage that I have gotten familiar with over the years and not all of a sudden do heavy doses I'm not used to then she is okay with it. I have been encouraged to share my experiences in session and as the results are always much more positive than some of the fear I can fall prey to at times while under the influence she basically in so many words encourages continued use. I might be wrong but I feel like the education these people are getting in this field is becoming more open to psychedelic experiences as time passes.
