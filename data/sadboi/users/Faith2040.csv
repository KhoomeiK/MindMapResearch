    In this era of globalization your friends don’t have to just be people near you. Make new connections online. 
   Maybe you can try some form of voluntary work, in social services perhaps? It can give you an opportunity to meet people you can empathize with, make new acquaintances and feel fulfilled knowing you are helping someone else. ?? I think it’s worth a shot.

I always obsess over living on a farm, I even signed up for farmers dating 😄 WWoofing,  I own an almanac  and when the mania hits I collect compost and replant vegetable roots"
bipolar_irl,ep5sxmi,t1_ep321jb,1559060502.0,Yup. I did the while nine yards too
bipolar_irl,ep5sp7z,t1_ep2lc5w,1559060420.0,So relatable. The hardest part is answering to the people asking about it. Can I just say “I think I was just overexcited and now I realize I can’t actually do this so I’m shutting this down” ?
bipolar_irl,ep5saw1,t1_ep2izgb,1559060281.0,"Haha. And did you genuinely think it would get there? Millions in revenue, because I tend to be very convicted of the potential of the business"
bipolar_irl,ep5rt13,t1_ep2yjbx,1559060106.0,I totally agree. We need this
