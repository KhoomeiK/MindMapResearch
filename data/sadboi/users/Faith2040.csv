I too am very charming, confident and convincing when I‚Äôm in an elevated mood. It is easy to get funded and start projects but as you said, it‚Äôs the follow through. I hope the universe sends that special person my way soon. God knows I‚Äôve tried to do it on my own but those depressive episodes kick me really hard. 
Again, congratulations and thank you so much for sharing *hugs*"
bipolar_irl,er4anbh,t1_eqq8rbk,1560485393.0,Well this is a success story we need to hear
bipolar_irl,ep61sql,t1_ep602ou,1559063579.0,"Did the same thing love. But hey, you already do it on the side so keep at it. You may not be aggressively marketing but do what you can when you can. Don‚Äôt let those cards go to waste. 
I handed out all the ones I originally ordered while still high on the idea just didn‚Äôt order any more"
bipolar_irl,ep5tvwf,t1_ep5frsl,1559060834.0,"Oh honey, this is story of our lives I suppose. Kudos on still having some of the bees. Who knows you might pick it up again and grow it. I always obsess over living on a farm, I even signed up for farmers dating üòÑ WWoofing,  I own an almanac  and when the mania hits I collect compost and replant vegetable roots"
bipolar_irl,ep5sxmi,t1_ep321jb,1559060502.0,Yup. I did the while nine yards too
bipolar_irl,ep5sp7z,t1_ep2lc5w,1559060420.0,So relatable. The hardest part is answering to the people asking about it. Can I just say ‚ÄúI think I was just overexcited and now I realize I can‚Äôt actually do this so I‚Äôm shutting this down‚Äù ?
bipolar_irl,ep5saw1,t1_ep2izgb,1559060281.0,"Haha. And did you genuinely think it would get there? Millions in revenue, because I tend to be very convicted of the potential of the business"
bipolar_irl,ep5rt13,t1_ep2yjbx,1559060106.0,I totally agree. We need this
