depression,fql1pwl,t1_fqkz7v1,1589443235.0,"I haven’t thought about this in a long time, but yeah, I think that is a major problem. Back in high school, I always HATED the “emo” kids because they were all about this supposedly suicidal and depressed image that was cultivated by pop culture, but if you really paid attention to most of these kids, they would end up betraying the fact that they were not really depressed. Some of them were, no doubt, but many of them weren’t. It was a popular act to threaten suicide over really dumb shit. Which made light of something that I felt a lot. It made me feel like a fucking joke, like they were doing a parody of my life.

Who am I to judge though, right. Now I’m the fucking asshole in society that I was talking about, right? What a mindfuck. It’s all part of the problem.

I can relate, about the gun. I’ve held a short shotgun in my mouth many times with 00 buckshot in it. Idk what to say honestly, but I hope you don’t do it. I hope you somehow someway find a way to enjoy life or bring some meaning to it. I hope I do too, but I haven’t really had much faith in hope in a long time. If you want to talk about anything, just reply back. I have no one in real life to discuss this type of stuff with."
depression,fqkuezf,t1_fqju4qt,1589436580.0,"I appreciate you sharing this.
You see these posts talking about people finally beating depression, but what I always wonder is... how long will it stay that way? Will they become depressed again? Are they really set for life and everything will be grand here on out?

Without seeing comments like yours, I’ve always just assumed that person is kinda set for life, but the reality is, most people will become depressed again. Feeing better may not even last throughout the whole day (for me). I’ve often thought/said/posted things like the OP, only to feel back in the same spot later that day. Then I feel like a fool for believing even for a while that I had really escaped it and I was going to keep feeling better.

Sure, your post may not be optimistic and some people may not like that but the fact is, it’s often what reality is, and for me at least, it’s important to see that I’m not alone, this happens to others too... Despite how devastating it is to feel as if you’re better, only to wind up back there yet again."

Of course, I’m not just typing “opiate”, but more detailed stuff. Like I used to find links to blue light, drug forum, etc, but that stuff doesn’t really come up much unless you put something like site:bluelight.org at the end. Just curious if there are sites or resources I might be missing out on."
socialistprogrammers,fo9jmku,t1_fo9exf6,1587621430.0,"I can relate so much. It’s just crazy to even hear from someone who sounds like they are even remotely in a spot similar to mine. When I’m in the office, all I see are happy, smiling successful faces, which kind of makes me feel like even more of an outcast, because I know that they can see what I feel written all over my face, and it’s nothing good. I’m not a good “faker” at all.

I’ve always had this fear of getting fired since I started working. And at first, it is definitely what drove my productivity through the roof.  For the first three years, the fear wasn’t really justified (well, I suppose it was actually... at least 3 people I knew got fired, now that I think of it), but now I just feel like I’m running out of steam, burning out, like you said.

Anyway... I think (hope) everything will be okay. I really appreciate all of your kind words, and the genuine conversation. See, I feel like this is what this “socialism” stuff is about for me, you know? Taking care of each other, being genuinely interested in whether another person is okay, beyond how it’s affecting “profits”.  Not feeling like I’m ruining someone else’s day because I’m not fucking smiling constantly. Which is the vibe I get most of the time. Like damn! I’m sorry you have to deal with my anxiety! Haha...

I’m glad I could make you happy, and you absolutely made my day. I had a fucking meltdown today and reading this made me feel 10X better. I’m gonna take your advice, going to try and get a daily routine established, I think that will definitely help. At the moment, I have no routine, it’s in shambles... but I’m gonna work on it. And I almost forgot I have even have PTO. Definitely need to take some time off."
socialistprogrammers,fo6b3jh,t1_fo5szlz,1587553245.0,"Wow, another great post! I just want to say thank you so much for posting this. You really have no idea how much it helps... this is my first time saying this but... solidarity, comrade :)

You are right, it does feel good to be productive, when I’m not productive I feel so anxious and depressed and I’m always in fear of not meeting expectations and immediately start thinking, “oh god, I’m gonna get fired”. Yet, I feel like if I were given the opportunity to be healthy again, I could do much better.

Also, about “invisible disability”, you are so right. Unfortunately no one else around me really sees it this way, despite me giving my boss a letter from my psychiatrist asking that I be able to work from home 3 days a week (the office greatly increases my anxiety, leading to more depression). And yes, our “goals” this year are just that... ever increasing productivity... 10% less in one area... 10% faster... 10%more... etc.

As far as taking care of myself, too. I feel like there just nailing everything here. My case may be more severe than others or rare, idk. But I feel like because of this situation I’m in, I find it damn near impossible to take care of myself. Since taking my first job out of college, and things getting progressively worse, I’ve eventually reached this point where I literally don’t take of myself at all really. I have excellent insurance, but don’t even use it. I can’t blame it all on my job I suppose, as my anxiety also interferes with this. But I feel like it would be much easier if I had the time, and I really could get myself taken care of better.

Thanks again so much for the post, it really did mean a lot. I’ve saved these comments. I plan on reading your other posts tomorrow (well I guess today lol) at some point."

Alas, I squandered the time, and am now miserable with my work (that is related to my degree, I just feel like I have zero free time.)

Work on a foundation (some sort of small business?) to sustain your future self while you still have the time! Don’t be like me! Don’t wind up a slave to “the man” for life!

LilPeep,eymaz0t,t3_cxntwd,1567204051.0,"A few days ago, I’d posted another sticker my GF made, here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/LilPeep/comments/cwar0m/my_girlfriend_works_at_a_print_shop_and_printed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

If anyone is interested, let me know, she can print these two stickers, and possibly other ones, if there is enough interest. If anyone is interested DM me. We can print in any solid color, and they peel off, there is no invisible background, only the design itself. You can stick them on anything, I chose my car window. If there is anything about this that breaks the rules, mods, let me know and I will delete this post, or you can delete it yourself and let me know. I didn’t see anything specific in the rules about it.
Thanks guys, love you all and Lil Peep!"
LilPeep,eyma2kf,t1_eyfi8of,1567203369.0,I could probably make you one
LilPeep,eydngq9,t1_ey9mjmf,1567021707.0,Thank you

Also, curious what drugs Maggie is using?

Anyone know?"
LilPeep,evtkr75,t1_evtjxz0,1564772507.0,This is what I always thought it said. Makes more sense to me.

socialistprogrammers,esd00rn,t1_erobfcy,1561843442.0,"Just make your tweets private to only friends and don’t add potential employers or coworkers to your friends. Idk if you can do that on Twitter because I don’t use Twitter, but Facebook. I’ve said similar things and never had any problem. 

Or just delete the tweets. I don’t think it is unusual these days for prospective employers to check out your social media accounts. But I’m not 100% sure."

SuicideWatch,esa86b0,t1_esa7xbn,1561753731.0,"Mine has gotten a little better, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things will turn around for you soon. ❤️ I'm here if you want to talk."
SuicideWatch,erdpsv1,t1_erdh31t,1560751401.0,"Thanks... it helps to hear thing a like this. Sometimes I just don’t know if I’m tough enough for this life. I kinda consider it a miracle that I’ve made it as far as I have. It’s just crazy because I did so great on my own despite the depression and anxiety, always did what I knew was “best” for me all those years, I didn’t start falling apart until 2 years into a “great” job. But the last few, I don’t know where everything fell apart and I lost myself. Even back then though, I was severely depressed. But not to the level where I just didn’t care about anything, which I’m closer to now.

I think a big part of it is my work environment, it’s a huge open layout so you are constantly surrounded by people and it feels like I’m in fight-or-flight mode all day.

Anyway I’m just rambling, thanks for your input man."
SuicideWatch,erdpcar,t1_erdn923,1560750811.0,"Thanks. Sometimes I just need to hear something that isn’t super positive, but still hopeful. I appreciate your input"
SuicideWatch,erdnk1f,t1_erdmqvh,1560748630.0,"The most frustrating thing is that no one can ever truly understand us, the pain we go through, unless they have been us. I think everyone's pain is unique. I get so tired of hearing the positivity shit and ""you can do it"" shit, like I don't think you understand people, I'm already diagnosed Major Depressive and Generalized Anxiety, how can I stop using the one thing that works for me and I can actually control. These pep talks sound very nice sometimes and I see how people can get sucked into them and believe it, but at the end of it, it doesn't change anything in my life, and I'm pretty powerless to change anything, at least I feel. I guess that kind of stuff works for some people, but not everyone. I can't be bullied into being happy. Everyone has to find their own reason to live I believe, and I just haven't found one that I won't fuck up.

And Yeah, I got lucky by going into Comouter Science... lots of jobs and good pay.

Hope things are going better for you now."
SuicideWatch,erdex12,t1_eqpkryh,1560739778.0,"Wow, I can really relate. Except I am the drug addict in my situation. But no one gets why I use drugs, to cover up pain they’ve never felt and couldn’t comprehend. I have had the battle with suicidal thoughts for a long time now too. They want me to be happy, but stable use of opiates is the only way I know to suppress the suicidal thoughts. But they don’t understand, mainly my girlfriend.

So much I wish I could say to her to make her understand and I wish she could just love me for who I am. I don’t really get wasted on stuff, I just take enough to function. But that’s not okay with them, they want me to be 100% clean.

It’s funny it’s like we’re in the same situation in one way, but opposite sides of the table the other way,"
SuicideWatch,eqoi4u4,t1_eqo4h1i,1560188831.0,This is my greatest fear in life.
SuicideWatch,eowuznq,t1_eows4o9,1558915254.0,"Exactly... I can't see a future for myself either.

I guess I always thought I would do great things. I never wanted to be a 9-5 slave for the man. But I don't know if I'll ever break free. It's like it's an endless cycle, every week, rinse and repeat."
