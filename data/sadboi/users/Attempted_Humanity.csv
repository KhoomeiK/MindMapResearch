I say each area is at least a little different as far as population density and observed spread. Regular testing as a percent of the population, testing of sewage, antibody testing - all just emerging or recently developed as possible options to gather data and make decisions.

Lives are not replaceable like income or jobs. I do think anywhere the virus is allowed to spread unimpeded has seen a huge uptick in illness and death. Whine about your hospital all you want - nothing will change the fact that the global supply of medicine and PPE cannot sustain a large population of critically ill patients. We can’t keep this going at high levels even if the high levels are only sustained within highly dense population centers.

The blame lies with a for-profit healthcare system taking advantage of a habitually sedentary and unhealthy population.
