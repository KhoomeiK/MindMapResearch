depression,fq9fjkj,t1_fq8ozfm,1589196633.0,Bro that is the reasons i would say . Anyways the last one is just the worst imo. Ofcourse all of them are terrible but the last one you can't addapt to and over time it can drive you crazy. You can also count it as lack of control.
depression,fq6quph,t1_fq6iarh,1589136617.0,"I am really happy to see this answer. I think its just about grasping those oppurtunities and turning it into some sort of improvement. Just wait for every factor to settle in and be patient. And this, this is what i'm totally trash at. I have to teach myself how to not be frustrared over everything and how to never give up or i will stay the same. I have been just surviving for so long, it seems as if i lost some of my abilities due to lack of work and alotta depression. Anyways thanks for the reply, really do appreciate it."
depression,fq5ftdr,t3_ggub8p,1589103754.0,"I really don't wanna be salty but holy shit, you're a lucky one. Just accept that you dont always have control over everything. There will be things that are considered (by you) unpredictable. Nobody can know everything or predict everything so therefore theres always a matter of luck there. Thats why we call it luck, if it was certain we wouldn't be dealing with a problem. So accept that you cant control every element. You cannot factor everything in. You just dont have control. And its okay to feel feer. To sometimes feel jumpy. I by all means, dont mean high levels of any of these symptomes but ofcourse like any other thing, low levels of all this effects are alright, even good. So what i would like to say is everything you do in life, everything you want to achieve will only be possible if you are lucky enough. Than you can start factoring in any other factor such as tallent, smartness, cleverness or among. So just do what you have to do but don't give up unless you are forced to give up. For all we know, you and i could be dumbest humans alive with the lives we went through. But here you are, here i am. Thankfullness might be what you need..."

AskReddit,fp5tlvn,t3_gbblg3,1588339616.0,"There are endless kinds of possiblities and nobody can know all of them so when something shitty or unlucky happened to you or is still happening just dont give a darn. Thats why we call it luck, if we knew it would be certain.

So yes, we live in a shit world where you first need the luck to achieve something. Than you can start factoring other things such as tallent, smartness, hard work or else."
learnprogramming,fa9zfc7,t1_fa91dbq,1575897679.0,Wait whats wrong with being c level.
