I still struggle a lot. But there is things to live for. You weren’t put here for nothing. If you tried ways to change and it doesn’t work, you have to change your approach. If that doesn’t work, try another way. You’re talking about you’re obesity. That can change man. You have to be willing to commit. And I know that’s super hard. Addictions are hard to crack. Especially food ones. But it can be done. There has to be something in this world you enjoy that keeps you going. If not, try to find it! 

I know it’s hard, you are a human. You matter. You may not feel that way given your circumstances. But people care.
