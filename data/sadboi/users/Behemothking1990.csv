LosAngeles,fhziu1l,t1_fhzif3y,1582000716.0,The landlords took it to court in front of a judge she tried to evict me and lost the case because they told her she couldn‚Äôt rent out that room because it didn‚Äôt have permits. And I already wrote her a professional letter right after the housing department sent me the letter saying she violated the law and had to pay out relocation assistance.
LosAngeles,fhzhpkf,t1_fhzh7hh,1581999841.0,Yeah the property is a private home with the back room I‚Äôm living in. Code enforcement came out and did the report. I gave a copy to the housing department and they sent me a copy of a letter saying that the homeowner had to pay me out relocation assistance.
LosAngeles,fhzg77z,t1_fhzfgph,1581998680.0,I did pay her she gave me receipts and I made copies of all them took them to the housing department and they told me. She Couldn‚Äôt collect rent because it was an illegal unit and it was not registered with the city. I‚Äôm just confused on the relocation assistance and how it works. Because I‚Äôm disabled and low income would I get paid out the maximum amount?
LosAngeles,fhwn6uf,t3_f52nyp,1581921560.0,"Ok I went to the office in North Hollywood on  Laurel Canyon Blvd and victory. The LA housing department and they told me a third party company will help me find a new place to live and they will also determine the amount I will receive for the relocation assistance.. I told the office that I was disabled and gave a copy of my disability letter, because the landlords put on the Application that I wasn‚Äôt disabled.."
LosAngeles,fhwmden,t1_fhwm4pj,1581920674.0,How was the process on getting relocation assistance? How long did it take for you to receive it? Did the housing department help you find a new place?

LosAngeles,fhwhzpg,t1_fhwgjst,1581916417.0,Yes I have the lease and the court said the lease is not Possible because it‚Äôs an illegal unit with no permits that‚Äôs what the judge said when the landlord trying to evict me last year and I‚Äôm still there and now the landlord went to the housing department to file the declaration of intent to evict. So the landlord can pay me out relocation assistance this is the first time I‚Äôve gone through this and I want to know what happens next. Also I am disabled and the landlords put down that I wasn‚Äôt disabled on the application.
