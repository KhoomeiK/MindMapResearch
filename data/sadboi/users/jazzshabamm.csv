bipolar,fptk570,t1_fpswewu,1588892756.0,"I hope so! I'm used to meds making me hungry, when I was on Seroquel I would wake up with granola bar wrappers all over the place and no memory of eating them and during the day I snacked constantly because I felt like I would fall over if I didn't eat. I'm glad to hear it reduces anxiety... I've declined the option to take a higher dose of Klonopin even though it just takes the edge off my anxiety. Although, if I just get a full night of sleep for the first time in God knows how long, it'll be worth switching meds again."

After Seroquel I was put on Latuda and I would go days without sleep. 120mg of Latuda barely did anything for my mania. Right now I'm taking 1.5 mg of Zyprexa with my other meds and feel significantly less manic. Although I still get the occasional shock when I look at my bank account and think where in the hell is my money??! Spending is my biggest impulse along with eating. (I guess that makes a mall with a food court my worst enemy LOL)

I have a moderate workout routine that I plan to start whenever I wake up and continue. I cut out frozen food and ive been trying to eat more greens and fruits. Aside from yogurt and cheese, I can't stomach dairy so I have soy milk and cashew milk. I drink water constantly and have limited myself to 1 cup of coffee a day. 

If it ever warms up and the covid crisis calms down, I'll go back to my extreme walking as I call it. My brother and I walk 3 to 8 miles three times a week. We joke that it's our excuse to hang out and play PokemonGo, which works for my motivation."

Full disclosure, my SL practically begged me to quit my job and be his new SGA (I was a regular customer buying steam gift cards weekly and every dragon Ball z tee I would see), which at the time seemed like a good idea. I did make double what I make now and held a higher position in management at my old job, but my SL's offer was too good to pass up even with the pay cut. Now I realize he was feeding me BS to fill an empty position.

WomensHealth,fezy4fl,t1_fezwyac,1579463142.0,And thank you so much for all of this information. It's much clearer to understand than flipping through Google search results and the doctor spewing all kinds of medical terms at me. I also have a question. When I had the BV I had a strong smell of ammonia coming from my body. I was guzzling down water and could not get enough to quench my thirst. The doctor checked and I didn't have any urinary tract or kidney issues. But the smell was so bad that I could not go to work. What would cause such a horrendous smell?
WomensHealth,fezxi89,t1_fezwyac,1579462978.0,What would be a good maintance product? Between the monistat 1 & rePHreah probiotic I have gotten a good bit of relief. I've cut excessive sugar out of my diet and added yogurts with live cultures. I only tested positive for the yeast infection not BV when I saw the doctor yesterday. The antibiotic medication that starts with an M (I forget what it's called) made me so sick with the oral dose.
WomensHealth,feq5oe7,t1_feq5d5y,1579337996.0,I'm taking women's probiotics. I take a multivitamin as well. But I do eat oranges regularly. The infections became less severe after I started the probiotics.

GameStop,fd7igzb,t3_einnc6,1578205058.0,"AT&T is horrendous. I worked for a franchise type deal previously owned by GS and sold to Prime Communications.

legaladvice,fd7hiee,t1_fd7haox,1578204600.0,On the 17th I woke up violently ill and when I called my manager demanded I work my shift that night regardless of how sick I was. I could not work in the condition I was in.
legaladvice,fd7haox,t1_fd7eyzv,1578204500.0,"The health issue was a non contagious bacterial infection, my store manager pushed me and tried to get me to divulge extremely personal information when I said I was sick. According to the HR handbook, when calling off for a sickness, you are only required to tell store leadership that you are sick and provide proof of a visit to the doctors. I'm not unionized or anything, just a regular retail sales manager. I was sick before work on the 17th when I called off long before my shift. I have actually had this problem for awhile and it was heavily implied that I would be terminated if I continued having appointments (on my days off) so I ignored it... Leading the infection to spread to other organs and tissue. It was a mess. I'm all cured now though. It only took a week of antibiotics to fix. I have no contract but my store leadership is in constant breach of HR policies and somehow finds a way to always weasel his way out of the messes he creates. 

Due to the current pit that I am in, I won't disclose what retail company I work for, but based on posts by other employees in their subreddit, other employees have been put into similar situations and worse. 

I guess my main question is, why would they put me on leave, call it two different things (suspension or leave of absence) and never notify me directly."
legaladvice,fd77e0m,t1_fd76ii9,1578200396.0,I never discussed a leave. I just said that I needed one day off to go to the doctors to get antibiotics and I would work my next shift because I was far too sick to work that day. I submitted doctors notes for the day I called off and I had the paper filled out by the doctor (who was very confused) so that I could have my absence/suspension ended. The most confusing part is that one person I talk to will call it absence another will call it a suspension. I have no clear answer to why exactly I am not working right now. I don't think one call off in a over half a year of employment waranted this situation.

bipolar,eyst3qb,t3_cyaiaa,1567411133.0,"I was approximately 110lbs when I started taking Seroquel. I hit 165 and that was my breaking point. I have no energy and just want to sleep because of the seroquel....however I started off slow with a workout routine and eased into dieting. More so eating better than actually dieting. I'm currently fluctuating between 147 and 150lbs, just kind of stuck there. I've gain muscle and visibly lost weight everywhere but my stomach. Seroquel is truly a double edged sword for me. I love that it makes me feel better overall but the weight gain and constant exhaustion is annoying as fuck.

For clarity: I am only 5ft tall & I'm aiming to be 125-130lbs, hopefully with some muscle. I never ever want to be skinny enough to count my ribs again. Not to mention going from a B cup to a DD was awesome."
bipolar,eym3dqi,t3_cx6k0r,1567198468.0,"Update; two days later he's suddenly come to his senses and realized ""I meant that shit"". Its not that I'm bored of him, I'm bored of my entire fucking life. But anyway he feels hurt and depressed, wasn't exactly my intention but that's how he feels. Idk what to do anymore. Like I said I love him but shit has got to change."
bipolar,eyjttig,t1_eyjtama,1567128071.0,Sometimes. Some days are amazing. Some days are boring. And rarely shit like this happens. Idk. I probably never should have went home last night tbh.
bipolar,eyjsjpk,t1_eyjbhj6,1567127092.0,There is a 99% chance he would have probably broken up with me if he knew I took an extra 5 minutes to take my friend home at the end of the shift too.
bipolar,eyjsejn,t1_eyjocqi,1567126983.0,"He said ""things will get better"", who knows though. He's on seriously thin ice though. I love him so much and terrified of losing the only thing that's been consistent in my life but if he just sees me as ""bipolar me"" not my own person I guess things wont work out. It makes me want to cry thinking about it."
bipolar,eyj8g5x,t1_eyj7ns6,1567114120.0,"I'm not going to. I'm not even talking to him till I get an apology. If he's truly committed then he should apologize and admit he was being an asshole. I really love him and I dont want to kick him to the curb but its inexcusable and I actually feel worse now than I did when I snapped on him. 

Just because I'm bipolar does not mean I'm not capable of having my own thoughts. 

It breaks my heart saying this but I dont think I can spend my life with someone who thinks every time I get mad or say something he doesnt like is because I'm bipolar. 

I'm scared. He was the one that convinced me to go see a therapist and psychiatrist. He made me realize I did need help. And he has been my rock in my shitty life."

bipolar,ey7p1y7,t1_ey7oxsl,1566893383.0,"Feeling indifferent and just doing whatever I want is usually a dangerous combo for me. I try to find engaging activities to stimulate in a healthy way. Reading, walking through the woods, etc. The feeling eventually passes. Sometimes I feel it for days or sometimes it lasts months."
bipolar,ey7ou70,t3_cw0jw0,1566893068.0,"I can relate sort of. I have my emotions and attachments, I'm going through the daily motions, but my life seems monotonous and boring. I'm not suicidal but I'm indifferent to the thought of dying. I came close to doing something irrational and impulsive that would destroy everything I've built but I chickened out at the last minute. 

Not the same, but I get what you're saying."
bipolar,ey7lgha,t1_ey7kdqx,1566888354.0,"He had a really awful day about two days ago and I decided to pick him up from work and take him on one of my ""adventures"". We just drove around, talked, and ate nachos for an hour or so. He didn't want to go home after work so I thought escaping the monotony of his daily life for a few hours would be nice. And it was nice for me too. Something different than the norm. Obviously I can't even begin to imagine what he has been through but I want to be there for him. We both REALLY like Star Wars--I've never met anyone who knows as much about it as I do. He is technically my manager and calls me young padawan sometimes. It's quite quirky lol. But I know when he vents or talks about dark stuff he wont smile. I just want to do what I can to be there and be something good in his life that doesnt make him hurt."
