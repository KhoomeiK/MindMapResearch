Essex,foqjgtc,t3_g8zsas,1587994944.0,"Hi live in Leigh on Sea. We have the c2c line to London. Fenchurch Street takes around 40-45 minutes.

Parking is awful unless you have off street parking, and the crime rate is fairly high. Especially in neighbouring Westcliff-on-Sea and Southend. We do have good schools though.

North of London Road to me is slightly cheaper than my area and I live right by Leigh Broadway. During normal times between here and Southend you can get any type of cuisine you desire, Lakeside shopping Centre is a train ride away and we also have the longest pier in the world.

Do look at the crime rates and area on Google maps though. Happy to answer any other questions"
