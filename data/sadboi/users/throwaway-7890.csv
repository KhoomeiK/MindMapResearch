I'm undergoing severe depression since the past few weeks and eventually I've started looking at the bigger picture here. Once you're back to your healthy self (which is inevitable) you're going to turn everything around and make up for lost time, you know it! It's not you, it's the condition.

But so far I have had no such issues with Seroquel, started two months ago. Infact, as a tranquilizer, I've always felt better taking it during a depressive episode.

But usually I tend to skip it twice/thrice a week due to the drowsiness, and sleeping in for hours. I guess our bodies react to it differently, but I still wouldn't be too quick to blame the Seroquel. You should check in with your doc"

She has a long way to go, and learn. While the process may hurt those around her. I take special care to ask everyone if I have hurt them in any way (post mania and depression). 

Decide what is best for you own self."

I've experienced something exactly similar this January and it kept prolonging with no signs of improvement.
The only way it got better was when I swallowed a lot of stress around me and it eventually triggered mania. I thus snapped out of the low, and I haven't found myself in that gruesome mental state again.
But that's not safe, I don't recommend it. Although it worked for me.
I am glad knowing you are getting sufficient sleep!"

bipolar,eqpwaav,t3_bz35nl,1560205742.0,"It is extremely likely that this is depression. It may not seem entirely obvious to you, but once the mood starts dropping lower you'll see.
So my advice is to prepare for it! Make sure you don't schedule an important task in the coming days, or plan your week ahead for when depression does hit.

Start taking sufficient sleep. It will help the most."

bipolar,eqlfnht,t1_eql5iva,1560143510.0,"Hey thanks, I am in better state these days :)
I had just been off my meds for about 5 months now (my doctor doesn't know) which I decided when I hit an unbearable low. I figured they're not working.
I started taking them again about a week ago and I really want to reach my optional dose again asap (where I left it) and hopefully manage increasing it to avoid falling into bipolar depression again. It is really taking its toll in my life. I'm 23 turning 24 soon and I really can't afford the (what seems like) endless lows at this phase in my life. It's costing me a lot.
There is so much I wish to learn and experience and achieve, all of this is really holding me back.
I guess me quitting my meds for a while was maybe in wish of forgetting I have bipolar at all ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
