EstrangedAdultChild,fqwi9sp,t1_fqwgj1v,1589705409.0,"Very happy to answer and help a fellow human out :). 

I'm also an advocate of meditation, I am a amateur instructor and have been for some years. I was studying it as well for certification, ended up pausing. But its beneficial, agree. For me, there was a limit to what it could do. I needed a deep retrieve and grieve on body trauma and memories stored. That's where therapy helped. 

Ps congrats on what sounds like wonderful #selfcare!

The critical things I got from therapy were: a sense of 'I matter...really, I do' (this had evaded me for years!), allowed me to feel truly safe for the first time with sensitive and vulnerable info about me and my world, gave me access to suppressed things within me, helped me validate my TRUE self and real feelings re disappointment re family. Gosh and so much more. It really helped me see me as a totally separate being, helped me see the family as a unit and with roles. Was easier and easier over time to access feelings instead of intellectualize (a defensive coping mechanism for trauma). 

My social support was therapy (but I ended it now, though it's very comforting knowing I can go back anytime). It was also me myself and I. And my partner. I didnt find that I could really be around others a lot while I did this process. And if I was around others, it had to be boundaried. Therapy helped me reevaluate how I give my time, to whom, and so on.huge victory for me as a former people pleaser. I also joined a facebook estrangement group, it's nice knowing it's there. And some reddit groups. I do have 1 friend who knows my story, known her just 1.5yr now. But we take the friendship really slow and steady. We are respectful of each others limits and personal issues, so we dont push. This is a first for me with friends, truly. Because previously I had big issues with having the confidence to set boundaries, and I'd routinely create a reenactment of the dynamic at home where I was expected to play free Counsellor, sometimes without reciprocity, or, with no equal return. That HAD to stop. It has now. But I will have to be vigilant on this matter for the rest of my life. Not hard, as i have good new foundation now, but replacing the faulty relational inner template HAS to happen for healing to happen...so I believe based on my experience anyway.

Initially, i went grey rock with my parents. Then low contact with them. Meanwhile I kept trying to remain open to my 3 siblings but that got Hard. 2 are young and still in the fold, effectively brainwashed like I was. One was on good terms with but she came to my place and stole things twice. I finally had woken up to all the crappy things I was used to accepting and said ENOUGH! that sibling blocked me in everything since. I'm okay with that. Now, I am no contact with all of them. There's extremely minimal and shallow reciprocity from my youngest 2 siblings re my life, so I stopped kissing their ass and trying to have a relationship. My parents got mad I stopped playing the free therapist but it is what it is. I dontnhear from them and I dont reach out. My sibling who stole tried to call re covid but she's a flying monkey for them , she baits to get info. So I don't respond. It's sad. And I really gave an inordinate amount of my childhood and life and time to them all. But it is best for me to let go and move forward because no matter what, noone is accepted for themselves. It's just roles and power games. But I finally learned that I dont even have to bid in and play. I can literally walk away . Not just physically but emotionally too.i dont have to feel bad or guilty. It is what it is. And I didn't create this mess myself. I was born into it. All I'm responsible for is my own welfare. And unfortunately, I can't be well and around that dysfunctional atmosphere. It only brings me down and leads to self betrayal and resuming old roles. And I refuse to go there. Hope that helps"
EstrangedAdultChild,fqwekoa,t1_fqwdjj5,1589701635.0,"I feel like I've had it in stages. Like when I first moved out of home at 19, I had such a rush of energy and feeling free. Then, in my early 20s, circumstance brought me back home. Then I regressed into my old role somewhat. Leaving again at 24, total relief. But also came apart as I realised their love was conditional and my parents had somewhat used me as an inhouse child therapist. Again at 30 upon entering therapy, a feeling of rebellion. Now 33, a feeling of peace and acceptance through grieving and allowing myself to mourn for what I missed. Different stages...different growth"

AskWomenOver30,fqku91h,t3_gj7ytg,1589436443.0,"I had stockholm syndrome (trauma bond) to my family of origin. Bottom line my parents were abusive, neglectful, manipulative assholes. It took 3.5 years of therapy to unpack it all. And even though I moved out of home at 19, it was not enough to 'get them out of me'.

I've changed SIGNIFICANTLY since I was 25. I've had life altering situations (a sexual assault at 23) - which then provided more clarity on my families inability to have empathy or handle vulnerability. 

Coming from dysfunction is not easy. Its confusing to get out of and feels like you escaped prison often. 

These days I have no contact with my family of origin and am healthier and happier for it. But it's still hard because it's not natural to not have contact, however, I cannot tolerate abuse or disrespect. I have had my fill.

So. Today, my life isn't perfect. I'm 33. I'm in some debt. I'm in the second highest COVID-19 country in the world and it's not easy. But. I have the love of my partner and that's all I ever wanted. I just wanted warmth. And I have it. 

My mindset has matured to value ME. I dont tolerate disrespectful people or gossipy mean jerks. I keep my circle small and practice self care daily. I dont always do well but I am consistent in effort. I focus on my partner too, and his recovery from his own dysfunctional family, and am working towards becoming a therapist. I'd say I've matured, grown, broken free, broken out of the mould, and finally learned I deserve love. A lot of change happened especially, between age 25 to 33 for me. Remarkable change really.
