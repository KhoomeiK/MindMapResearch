mentalhealth,etlxbtd,t1_etlgkkr,1562947397.0,"She told me she was gonna bring my mom in to give her some papers because she was going to refer me to the psychiatric hospital but when my mom went in & took the papers, the doctor started asking her questions as if THEY were in session & I said ""I'm feel uncomfortable with her being here.""  My mom stood up & was about to leave & the psychologist raised her voice saying ""No, you sit down! I'm the one in control here & I will not let you two get out of control. I won't let you disrespect your mother like that.""  to which i said ""I have not disrespected her"" & she said ""you said you were uncomfortable & it gets me very mad because I don't have a mother & I wish I did.""  after that she said some stuff about me going to get antidepressants, we were done so I was walking out the door when I said I was gonna kms & that's when she told me to do it. Not once did I raise my voice to her nor did I disrespect my mother. She started raising her voice & bringing her personal life into the session. I thought that was kinda weird because no other therapist had done that to me before"
