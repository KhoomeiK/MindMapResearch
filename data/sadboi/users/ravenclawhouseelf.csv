I feel better about myself because I'm using my time to better myself. I dont feel any different in terms of sexual health. But I'm only 10 days in. 

As of right now the hardest part is the 20 or so minutes in bed before I fall asleep and the few minutes between waking up and getting out of bed.  Those are the times I'm most tempted to to pull out my phone and surf. But so far I've avoided it.

I will say that my will power does feel slightly stronger than it did 10 days ago. So maybe that's a result."
