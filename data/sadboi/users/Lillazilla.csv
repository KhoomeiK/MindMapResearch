Her main problem is that her mother refuses to get her help, even though she's been hospitalized, and shames my friend for self harming and being mentally unstable. Her mother has convinced her that she's lazy, dramatic, and doesnt need help and I hate not being able to help or intervene and she's getting so much worse. Nothing I do helps her. I validate her, it doesnt work. I listen, it doesnt work. I give advice with what helps me, it doesn't work. I hate seeing her like this, I just wish I could call CPS but I know I cant because she loves her mother so much and being taken away could make things so much worse. She's talked to school counselors and teachers and other adults and they've offered to help, but not only does my friend's mother refuse to get my friend help, SHE REFUSES OFFERS FROM OTHERS WHO WANTED TO PAY FOR HER TO GET HELP."
