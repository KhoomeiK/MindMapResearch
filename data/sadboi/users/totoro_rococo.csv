But speaking from my time with manic psychotic breaks and mental health problems in general, I really empathize with that inherent distrust of thoughts. It's very confusing to try and reconcile a ""ghost"" speaking to you and the voice in your head. In fact I think it can be very harmful, cause it leads to compulsions. You know one of the most common questions for general authorities at like firesides for teens?

A blurb about the book: ""Beginning with the roots of the disease in demonic possession and its secular successors, Davis traces the evolution of obsessive behavior from a social and religious fact of life into a medical and psychiatric problem. From obsessive aspects of professional specialization to obsessive compulsive disorder and nymphomania, no variety of obsession eludes Davisâ€™s graceful analysis.""

AskReddit,ev5olds,t1_ev5m62j,1564236772.0,"Well, specific intentions matter more than specific phrases, I think. Communicating from a growth perspective means that you work to have a default intention to understand another person. You have curiosity and care for them, even if their words/tone are combative or otherwise off-putting. It's an intention to focus on what matters-- and since emotions are signals for our needs, you may be *think* you are talking with someone about X but their emotions and your own are actually signalling you both need Y. It also means focusing first on observation (self and person you are talking to), before jumping straight to interpretation.

If you say ""You're a jerk because you said something mean!"" then you have front-loaded an interpretation that can shutdown meaningful growth. If instead you said--""You said this, and it made me feel this way. What prompted you to say it?"" You give everyone a chance to be clear on what happened, before jumping the gun."

AskReddit,ev4yxy5,t1_ev4lung,1564224330.0,"There's something I just heard in this psychology [podcast](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/podcast/a-mindful-approach-to-nonviolent-communication-with-oren-jay-sofer/) that might be relevant. We all are trained to communicate with ourselves, and with others, from our families, society, the media, etc. This communication we learn can be full of bad habits. When people go about communicating from a ""deficiency"" perspective, i.e. ""I didn't become a doctor, so I want my son to be a doctor"", they can act a little more desperately. When you communicate from a ""growth"" perspective, then you are more willing to be flexible when things don't go how you want. 

We all have relational needs, social needs, as much as we need food and water. When we think of our ""higher needs"", like feeling you have a purpose in life, spirituality, etc...that's where some of our most long-standing emotions come from. If a parent is not succeeding in meeting those higher needs, they may lean on their children in a way that influences their autonomy. Again, because it's coming from a deficiency stand-point. If we rely on others to fill a ""hole"" in us, we will be desperate. If we are open to others to help us grow, but are hopeful and confident we can also grow on our own, then we will be generous."

OCPD,ev4rtag,t1_ev0rhiq,1564220108.0,"It's difficult because procrastination of any sort is an emotional problem, at it's core. Not to mention with OCPD there's the problem of task-hoarding. Even self-care can become difficult because of emotions that are involved, and then we avoid it. Note how in depression people tend to have really messy rooms...namely because it's emotionally difficult to engage in cleaning for them. Small things, but lots of stress. 

All the ""shoulds"" in the world can set us up to be disappointed in ourselves, which then makes us have negative emotions to the task at hand. It's a tough problem. Basically, the people that do well on self-improvement tasks like exercise are invariably the same ones that have associated positive emotions with those things, and enjoy them. So if your app is annoying for whatever reason, maybe try another avenue for meditation, something that is easiest to attach positive emotions toward. Thanks for posting on this sub, and by the way, there is a great Facebook group dedicated to OCPD with like 200+ members if you're interested."
