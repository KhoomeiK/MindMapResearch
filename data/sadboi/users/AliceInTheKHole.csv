Well people in anarchist societies still get those jobs done. Like i provided good and honest arguments. Under capitalism the main incentive for work is ""do it or you die"". That's not really appealing but people still do them. If you think that work should be imposed through negative reinforcements like that then that's just a fundamental disagreement on what kind of society we want.

Most of the work that people do now is not for the betterment of society but to make profits for someone else. There wouldn't be shortages even if work hours go down since the work that does get done is actually meaningful. If people's needs are met why are there homeless people, why are there people that starve to death, why are there people without access to drinking water etc. They are not met.

Yes i agree, the fact that liberalism is the staus quo doesn't validate it in the slightest.

""Global liberal democracy"" is pretty close to the status quo, obviously it's practically impossible to have a consistent ideology on a global scale and speak for yourself.

You said you wanted evidence to back up the theory, implying you want to see if it's possible, only now you shifted the conversation to is it better. 

Theoretically i would say yes in every aspect. I think if you would disagree it would either be because of a lack of understanding or a fundamental difference in what we want out of a society. 

If you study Makhnovia/Free Territory you'll see that it was very efficient and it was strongly aligned with the theory, which as i said is better.

GenZLiberals,fqxkk3y,t1_fqxdths,1589733734.0,"Yeah sure so i've already touched on the incentive to work in another comment but i'm gonna explain it again more in depth.

So first of all you mentioned that the incentive to work in a Marxist-Leninist society is not getting shot, which is really interesting. Ok. Now let's think about the work incentive in a capitalist society. Well, you work for money. Why? Because you actually need it. Why? Because basic needs that are indispensable to life are traded on the market. Therefore if you don't work you don't have money and you don't have access to those needs and you die. To me there is not a real difference between getting shot and starving or dying of a disease you can't afford to treat. You can try and argue that it's different but fundamentally it's the same. You work or you die.

Now let's talk anarchism. There are different schools of thought, but the overwhelming majority of anarchists advocate for the decommodification of basic needs and distributing them according to need. I've already talked about that in other comments so check those if you want.

What that essentially means though is that your fundamental right to life is unconditional, which that's how it should be with all rights. Now the thing that's left to talk about is work and the incentive behind it. And this is where those different schools of thought spring from. I don't want to get too specific or advanced but we can, for the sake of argument, split them all in market based (markets are not exclusive to capitalism and they don't need a state either) and gift based i.e. communist (no markets, no currency) economically speaking.

The markets would be made up of worker co-ops, the MoP would be communally owned and they would trade luxuries only, since needs are decommodified, as we've established.

Common incentives to work under both systems:

Since everyone has their needs met and you don't need to work for a capitalist that can fire you if he's unsatisfied with your labor for whatever reason (you're too slow, you don't work enough etc.) there would be first of all less work for people to do and second of all work wouldn't be as unpleasant, since you know that you have your needs met no matter what. The reason why people are overworked today is because you have the CEO that wants to maximize profits for himself and that means overworking his employees, who'll accept or take their chance at another company, knowing that they could always not find work and die.

Other reasons for working would be respect earned, the betterment of your community and possibly mankind, self-realization, pursuing your passions etc.

1. Market anarchism specific incentive to work would be getting paid with some kind of work compensation that can be exchanged for luxuries, more unpleasant and difficult jobs would naturally have a better pay. 

2. Anarcho-communist specific incentive to work is similar to the market one but since there is no market and currency, benefits like more vacation time, payment in the form of luxuries etc. would constitute the incentive. 

>Also, what about the arts? I can only see art flourishing in a capitalist society. The arts don’t expressly create material value to the community, but rather have value from the cultural enrichment they provide. In a capitalist system people have the choice to create art, and the equilibrium rate for what they produce is decided by the market as people decide the monetary worth of what they create is? How would this possibly work in an anarcho-communist society?

I think it's very interesting that you bring up art since i enjoy it quite a bit, but i couldn't disagree more with your conclusions.

In a capitalist society artists can rarely dedicate themselves to their passion since first and foremost they have to make a living. They either sacrifice their time by getting some kind of job that doesn't even pay that well or they risk even more by trying to make a living out of their art. Art is a form of human expression, how can you put monetary value on such a thing? The artist then has to sacrifice his own ideas and make art that sells, rather than art that evokes emotion. I think you've heard of the ""starving artist"" stereotype. All the artists i've ever talked to say that it's incredibly hard to make it because of these reasons. In capitalism, you can have a Vincent van Gogh slave away at a corporate job that doesn't benefit human culture, only the pockets of the CEO, who will probably he himself decide what art is worth paying for. Under capitalism humanity serves the economy, when we're being told it's the other way around. 

Imagine now that the artist has his full needs met. He can dedicate himself to pursuing his passion without fear that his art won't sell and that he will starve to death before someone decides that his work is worth paying for.

That's the whole point of anarchism, you see? To ensure well being for all, because yes it is more than possible, and allowing us to fully dedicate our lives to our passions, to our arts and to our crafts. To allow us the liberty necessary to pursue self-realization."
GenZLiberals,fqxcdtu,t1_fqx7ukz,1589729855.0,"I can see where you're coming from. I used to think the same. I'm not an utopian, i always want to approach situations in a pragmatic, scientific way. 

Having said that, it's way more advantageous for someone to cooperate with their community than to just try and exploit others. People are also ultimately a product of their environment. I don't think anyone that is born into this world naturally wants to harm others. That's what a capitalist society makes you believe. It alienates you from your community and promotes this hyper-competition since nothing or very little is promised and everything has a price.

When the transition between feudalism and capitalism was being made, people could and probably did make similar arguments. ""It's human nature to harm others in your self-interest, without a king to rule over us, we would just all be at each other's throat."". Turns out, it's not only possible, but even more efficient. It's the same situation now with capitalism and the state. You're born into this world and you're being told about human nature and how people are greedy and that we need an authority to rule over us to ensure that that won't happen, when in reality it's exactly that authority that is greedy and turns us against each other. If people must be kept in check who keeps in check those that keep us in check? And so on... 

If it's human nature we want to study, then we shall take a look at the beginning of mankind, the hunter-gatherer era. If humans are fundamentally greedy and exploitative how is it that there was no king, no state, no money to rule over us? How did we not only survive but evolve so much if we were at each other's throats constantly, fighting over any scrap that we deemed valuable? That's because if we go back to our roots we can see that it is cooperation that lead us so far. And it is cooperation that will lead us even further. If you start questioning everything around you, you'll start to see that things are not as essential as you're first lead to believe.

Why would you take more than you need? If it's free you literally have no reason to take more than you need. What are you going to do with the surplus? You can't sell it since people can get it for free.

Besides that i already mentioned that there would be people that would take notes of who takes what. There would obviously be a limit to how much you can take. You won't be able to fill up a truck with everything saying that you need it all for yourself. 

>How are personal property rights protected in a stateless society?

Private property would be abolished. The MoP's would be controlled by the workers.

>So with the airplane builders, this is the same thing. I think you'd be hard pressed to find one person in the world whose ambition in life is to do manual labor on an airplane factory assembly line just because they want to help their community.

I acknowledge that some jobs are less appealing than others. There are ways in which you can encourage people to do them.

If we don't abolish money, then that's pretty straight forward. You pay the workers enough so that those jobs get done.

If we do abolish money, we can provide those workers with things like more vacation time and luxury goods as compensation, besides the formerly mentioned things.

It's also worth noting that without having capitalists that want to maximize profits, people wouldn't have to work as much and if everyone has their needs met work wouldn't be as unpleasant.

>This also brings up the question, how do you run something like a factory without a hierarchy? Supervisors and managers are necessary to make sure everything is operating efficiently and production is on schedule

Does this mean that people only get what they need of food and water? How do you determine how much water someone needs to drink, shower, cook, wash dishes, wash clothes, etc?

You would have something like a warehouse or a store that's managed by a few people that keep inventory and keep track of who takes what. People would simply take what they need just like in stores now but you wouldn't have to pay. So that's the situation with needs. 

>As for shelter, if there's no personal property what happens with my home? Can anyone come live in my home and I can't stop them unless by force?

See the distinction between private and personal property. I value personal property very much as it is essential to individual freedom. No one will invade your house, your house is yours to live in, the only people that would move in are the ones you let in. 

>But without a state to pay them for their labor, why would they maintain the roads? What if a worker wants to do something else other than maintain roads? What if all the workers decide they want to do something other than maintain the roads?

Not all anarchists are against money. Even if for the sake of argument assume we abolish money i already went over why people would still want to work. Why would road workers want to work somewhere else when building roads is what they've been doing and is what they're best at?

Some forms of anarchism are not against money so the road workers would simply be paid for their labor in that case, on top of the work compensation that i've already mentioned in a moneyless case. You don't need a state to pay people, you need a government. Again, see the distinction in the definitions. 

>That's not what I meant, I was asking who manages airports and train tracks, who builds planes and trains?

The workers, just like now. Same thing with the road stuff. The state doesn't make things, the workers do.

This is similar to my way of thinking back when i was a liberal too. It's so common not because of its efficiency, but because it's mentained by force through the state, which is, as i mentioned, a monopoly of violence within a territory. Just because ""it works"" and some societies are ""successful"" doesn't mean it's the best system. Feudalism has worked for way more time than liberalism and some empires could be called successful, but now it's basically extinct. There was a time when it was the status quo but that doesn't justify it in any way. Succes is relative and liberalism definitely works better for some more than others, usually at the expense of those others. It's unsustainable and i think the world will eventually turn to anarchy one way or the other anyway.

GenZLiberals,fqwhw5r,t1_fqwgf9e,1589705008.0,"Well in that case you'd plant more apple trees. There would be people that would study the supply and demand of things and prepare for any possible scarcity. In the event of scarcity, resources would be rationed taking into account who needs them the most. Kids, old people, sick people etc. would have priority in that case. 

Scarcity is not a flaw of anarchism. It's a situation that can be present in any economic system. Now that i've explained how anarchism deals with it let's draw a parallel with capitalism using the same hypothetical. 


If there are not enough apples that naturally means that the supply is lower than the demand. Seeing that capitalism is a system that seeks to maximize profits, someone with enough capital would buy the whole supply of apples and they would create a monopoly on apples, which would be really lucrative for them at the expense of everyone else. It won't be taken into account who deserves or wants the apples the most, only who's willing to pay more to have them. 

We've reached a point in which we have enough for everyone though. How is it justified that we produce enough food for 10 billion people each year and there isn't even 8 billion of us, yet 3.3+ million people have already literally starved to death only from the start of this year? That number is only going up every day and whenever it goes up by one, some human being, somewhere was left to starve and that's only taking into consideration the food situation, without mentioning anything regarding drinking water, shelter, clothes etc."
GenZLiberals,fqwgnpl,t1_fqwfhjm,1589703737.0,">How does anarchism allow well being for all?

By decommodyfing basic needs and distributing them according to need. 

>How can you meet your basic needs like food, water, and shelter?

Same answer as my last one. How can you meet your basic needs under capitalism? You don't. I'm not going to do the math rn but if you add people that literally starve to death because they don't have food, people without drinking water, people without shelter etc. you'll get a huge number.

>How do you protect your property rights? (Or do you even believe in property rights?)

There would be no private property. The MoP would be collectively owned. 

>How can you travel from one place to another, who maintains the roads?

The workers, they're the ones that are doing it now. 

>How do you travel long distances like from California to new York? (For a European analogy, I guess London to Athens?)

You'd free to leave an anarchist society whenever you want to. 

>How do you send mail?

Just like you do now. 

>What are the incentives to innovate and create new technology that improves people's lives?

The betterment of your community and possibly even mankind, pursuing your passion, the appreciation that comes with it, self-realization etc."

Let's assume there is no money though. First of all, basic needs would be decommodified and distributed directly according to need so there is no need for trading those. It would be a gift economy and any trading would involve non-essential luxuries only. Your example is pretty clear cut and vague at the same time. Does anyone else have what that person has? Is there anyone else that can provide that thing? Where do they have it from? If it's a desirable thing and more people want it, it could be produced more so there's enough to go around."

Yes.

As leftists we do not strive to a society where everyone’s height or eye color are the same or that everyone will produce the exact same work, hence “from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.” 

Yes. 

But this doesn't have to do with egalitarianism. If you're using it as a counter argument it's probably the most gigantic strawman i've ever seen in my life. Egaliterianism doesn't mean that everyone should be a clone of each other, identical in every possible way.

But these are like extremely weak arguments or full on strawmen. Egaliterianism doesn't mean that absolutely everyone will have the exact same opportunities in life and that everyone should have the exact same outcome in every respect of their life.

Saying it will never happen is kinda irrelevant. First of all, it's completely possible, especially in smaller communities and second of all, assuming that there will always be some level of discrimination doesn't mean that we shouldn't constantly fight to try and minimize that as much as possible.

Reasons why i read theory:

-Different perspectives. I read stuff i partially or even totally disagree with. Why? Because it allows me to see other people's point of view. If i find something i agree with, i consider how i can incorporate that into my views. If i find something i disagree with i stop to think why and i form counter arguments, which can be useful when debating people of that opinion.

-I like to keep an open mind. If there's one thing i hate it's echo chambers and desperately clinging to a set of beliefs even when there's no real reason to.
