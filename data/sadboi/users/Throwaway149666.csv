tulsi,f4u5qs1,t3_dls639,1571799844.0,Haven't you heard? You're not allowed to post this here and if the moderators find out you could get banned. Crowder (who broke the story) is supposedly not a legitimate source.

relationship_advice,f28s2q4,t1_f25qej8,1570069287.0,"Ugh. Wish I would've had your foresight. I sent mine. The conversations started again and that was fine for a month or so before I decided she was bad for me and cut it off for good, but my letter essentially cleared her conscience when she didn't deserve it."
ChoosingBeggars,evnmi7e,t1_evn64tj,1564627764.0,"I don't understand all of these people who are upset over a contract that they WILLINGLY enter into knowing full well they won't get paid. 

If people refused to do unpaid internships they would literally cease to exist. And if employers needed people for those positions they'd realize they have to pay for them. 

How is this a difficult concept to grasp? No one is holding a gun to your head forcing you to do this job for free. If you want to get paid enter into a paying contract..."
SuicideWatch,evi9mw3,t3_cjorcm,1564539155.0,"I feel you. I just got turned down for a job today too. 

I operate a business that's failing and am out of cash reserves. The wife has completely given up on me perusing this endeavor and I don't blame her so I'm trying to hit the job market. Turns out that I'm remembering the whole reason I had to go work for myself in the first place. 

I'm no good. 

Any qualifications I may have are negated by the fact that I have a criminal record and the only options I [might] have are for jobs that prove my life is meaningless. Jobs that will just keep me miserable. Jobs that will keep my income in the range of 'barely getting by' ensuring that I'll never own a house or be able to afford to start a family (as if we're not almost out of time to do that anyway). 

To everyone here saying not to kill yourself over a job, maybe it's not just a job. Maybe it's the only way toward some semblance of a positive future and knowing that any hopes and dreams you MAY have had are simply no longer possible..."

adultery,eriigs0,t3_c27nip,1560898470.0,I came to Reddit today to hear exactly this. Thank you.
SuicideWatch,eqx3n0x,t1_eqx23ek,1560364760.0,"I'm sure they believe that. But as you well know from visiting this sub, people often need to be saved from themselves. That goes for parents who dig themselves into financial graves trying to support something completely useless as well.

An example: Full time caretakers of those with Alzheimer's or Dementia often devote everything they have to the person they're taking care of and anyone who has gone through that before will tell them they need to make sure they're thinking of themselves just as much if not more than their ""patient"". It's common that caretakers of these people will find themselves having strokes, literally killing themselves because of the unbelievable stress they're under, and they still continue with the same self destructive behavior because it's ""in the name of someone they love"" when that person can literally offer nothing in return."
SuicideWatch,eqx1t1h,t1_eqx1hgz,1560364149.0,For some people I'm sure that's true.
SuicideWatch,eqx13zb,t1_eqwzufb,1560363920.0,Any reputable carrier will pay out after 2 or 3 years of having the policy for suicide. In my policies there is only an exclusion for dying while committing a crime so I could off myself the second the ink dries and so long as there are no 'material misrepresentations' in the application they are under contract to pay.
SuicideWatch,eqwy9pd,t1_eqwtim2,1560362990.0,Some of us have life insurance policies which are the only way we'll ever be able to repay our parent's investment. I for one know that I'll never amount to anything that would get even remotely close to the $1.8M they'd receive if I offed myself and that to me doesn't sound so selfish.
therapy,epc1wl9,t1_epbysmv,1559149290.0,I'm simply explaining the logic my therapist gave me for being willing to reduce her price.
therapy,epb4bix,t3_budbwo,1559137561.0,My therapist reduced her rate by $50/week due to financial constraints. In their profession ethics take precedent and the ethical thing to do would be to help you keep regular treatment by any means necessary. All you have to do is talk to them about it.
