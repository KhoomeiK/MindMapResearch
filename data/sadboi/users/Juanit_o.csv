I think for him it's not the fact that you don't like or know his show it's the fact that you lied to him about it. You could replace the cartoon with soccer, or a band, or a hobby. Yes he's kind of over reacting but also you shouldn't lie about stuff, it makes it easier to know someone's likes and dislikes right away and see if there's an alignment of personality traits. Next time I'd say just be honest, if you've never seen a show, heard of a band or what not just say so and he can show you why he likes that certain thing.

Was nowhere near as accurate as I wanted to be but I learned from there, from reading, from videos n whatever else I could find. Last thing new shooters need is an angry gun store comando yelling at then n discouraging them making them feel dumb. I'm not downplaying safety at all but they need to learn the bare bone basics somewhere. We need as much allies to normalize gun ownership.
