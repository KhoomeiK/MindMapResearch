EDAnonymous,fqx2vh4,t1_fqvpz9b,1589724523.0,I’m not trying to deny kids eating disorders that are on tiktok but to be fair most of them think that if you skip breakfast one day you have anorexia. Yes it’s disordered behavior but they are doing it simply because it’s became a new trend in way. Most of them just see it as a way to make relatable jokes.

unpopularopinion,fd9ly1m,t3_edqtzu,1578235170.0,"I’m saying this in the clearest way possible. Stop. Feed your body the energy that it needs. It’s one thing to be on a diet and have craving for pizza, donuts, etc. but when you begin to feel like hunger makes you feel “good” or maybe even accomplished then that’s the beginning to something dangerous. If you don’t like the feeling of being full you can just eat in small meals throughout the day. Please treat you body right. It does so many amazing things only if you provide it the energy it needs <3"

depression,fct8iau,t3_eihb2v,1577935698.0,This is the most relatable post ever. I feel like a complete waste of life. I’m not worth anybody’s time they’ve given me. All the opportunities handed down to me. I don’t deserve them. It doesn’t help when my mom went through blood sweat and tears to give me a fortunate life. There’s millions of people dedicating their lives just so they can have a single chance in getting an education. I shouldn’t deserve this. Everyday I feel guilty in having such a privileged life with me not doing anything to earn it.
