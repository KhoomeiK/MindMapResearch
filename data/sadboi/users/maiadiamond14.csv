They are a good feature of yours! Your hair looks healthy but have some fun with it! Since you're young now's the time to try different colours. Do something bold, I've found getting my hair done dramatically increases confidence. Not everyone looks better with weight loss - think barbie ferrera or parris goebel. Your mouth is a bit on the small side but you're cute when you smile! maybe overline your lips and watch some tutorials on making your lips bigger. Confidence more than anything! Not sure how young you are, but the toys are a bit strange. Maybe clean your room and fill it with slightly nicer things, if possible! A photo is 90% good lighting!"

Being nervous is okay! It shows that you want to be there. But don't be nervous because you desperately need a job, be nervous because *this* was the job you want. Be interested in what they are talking about and respond with non-verbals. If you nod your head they should subconsciously nod back. Try and not face them head-on, as it's very confrontational. If you assume a relaxed posture, you will genuinely feel more relaxed and come off that way too.

Have a list of questions prepared for them about your pay-rate, employee culture, ask if anyone has ever left on bad-terms, success stories, how high the ladder can go within the company.. There's a lot of small things you can do that are separate to experience. Experience helps, but with experience comes complacency. You can't train attitude."

If I was you I'd check in on your daughter, find out how she honestly feels. She might be a little embarrassed too. Just be there for her. It might be good for her to learn that adults can make mistakes too. Guilt and regret are healthy emotions and you don't need to be a perfect parent to be a good one.

Maybe make a decision in yourself whether you did the right thing or not and start from there.. then you can go about fixing things, if thats what you want to do.

Good luck random stranger! I hope you'll be ok!"
