bjork,fqt8azy,t3_gkld4k,1589632945.0,Oh. I never read that review and I think it would royally piss me off if I did as Pitchfork is infamous for stupid reviews. If I had Twitter I’d retweet this to that guy on the regular.

bjork,fq5lotk,t3_ggyxd2,1589110109.0,It was also “It’s Oh So Quiet” for me because it was on heavy rotation on MTV and I was obsessed. EDIT to say that this was 1995. I’m old and reading about people being in high school not too long ago and discovering her is great but also a reality check. Wow I’m old. 😭
AskReddit,fq3pzza,t3_gge8dn,1589068901.0,Yeah it was many years ago on this date. She was 14. I suspect it was an aneurysm due to a direct hit from a lacrosse ball to the temple. It was my (and probably many of the other students’) first wake).
