raisedbyborderlines,fr4mtsa,t1_fr4h6fv,1589892419.0,"Yeah, that’s a good point. I’ll try to find a new therapist - I just hope there is an availability close to where I live, as public transport or Uber still doesn’t seem very safe to me despite our lockdown long having been lifted. Do you have any advice on grey rocking her? It seems so difficult to me, because she just kind of pins me into a corner and goes off on me in a tearful speech if I refuse to engage..."
raisedbyborderlines,fr4mfl3,t3_gkpd12,1589892147.0,"I can relate very well to this. Like you, it took me a long time to figure out that my mother has BPD, and that none of her behavior was ever normal. It hurts and in my experience, it takes a long time to even come to terms with it. Therapy helps a lot."
raisedbyborderlines,fr4m6ac,t3_glh3cv,1589891972.0,"I can relate so well myself. My BPDmom is very similar, she’s a clean freak and everything needs to be perfect and untouched all the time. An example: We have a couch in the living room that we are only allowed to sit on in certain positions and if we have a blanket underneath us. We are not allowed to rest our heads on the headrest without a blanket. We are not allowed to sit down heavily but need to slowly lower ourselves down onto it. Nobody is allowed to have pens anywhere near them when sitting there. Or food. Or water."
raisedbyborderlines,fr4ljtq,t3_glxwvu,1589891527.0,"So many things...but one recurring theme was her not allowing me to hang out with friends anywhere but at home where she could keep an eye on us. Doing things like going to the mall with friends was completely unacceptable, and she hated almost all my friends from school and later university, saying they were “primitive” and a “bad influence” on me. I remember pleading with her to go to my best friend’s birthday party when I was 16. She said no because “there will be boys there and bad girls who want you to drink and smoke and have sex”. I remember pleading with her at age 20 to let me go out for a sushi dinner with a female friend at university (I couldn’t afford to move out, so I was stuck throughout all my years as a student). She said no and flew into a rage after randomly seeing my friend on the street because said friend was wearing shorts and “that’s unacceptable company for me.” 


I could go on. The result is that I’ve mostly lost interest in socializing, and only am able to enjoy it after longer periods of not seeing my mother (which are rare). It sucks, and it’s made me a supremely boring person."
raisedbyborderlines,fqt15nm,t1_fqq00q3,1589626367.0,"Yeah, I agree...but it’s so hard, her BPD is in overdrive by now because of the long period of being at home with my dad and me, and now she’s trying to control everything. I mean sometimes I’ll leave my phone somewhere for a bit and she goes “you need to have your phone when he texts because he will be disappointed if you don’t reply immediately”. I don’t engage her in these things but she just goes on and on, and it’s basically noise pollution at this point."
raisedbyborderlines,fqpzdce,t1_fqpss7r,1589556721.0,"Thank you for your kind words! I ended up canceling on my boyfriend for tonight and am laid up in bed gaming. Meanwhile, my mom is telling me I should have gone because “after all, you took a two hour work call yesterday and didn’t cancel”. Erm, yes. Because those two compare. Besides that, I am trying very hard to keep her out of my relationship - I don’t talk about it at al but she keeps digging and digging and even tries to read what I’m texting if I make the mistake to have my phone out when she’s anywhere nearby..."
shingles,fqjalrl,t3_gi74qq,1589407292.0,"I also have an outbreak (ny second one already so I know what to expect) on my upper thigh, close to my groin, and my god, my lymph nodes are awful and so are my hip and lower back. I got a very high dose of vitamin B prescribed by my doc, like I did last time, and I’m pretty sure it’s what helped keep the pain at bay back then already."
depression,fks0sp6,t3_fjthj0,1584479911.0,"I feel similar. After almost two years of crippling nonstop depression, I finally managed to find a bit of joy in life again, and even found someone to date and feel excited about. My second date already got canceled because my country is in complete lockdown, and I’m not allowed to set foot outside if not for groceries or a pharmacy run. I just went back on anti anxiety meds, after this period of actually feeling stable enough, and it’s terrifying me."

raisedbyborderlines,fhxjq34,t1_fhxc9ma,1581955933.0,"Exactly! It could be either her having this manic kind of enthusiasm about something or her screaming, crying and wailing about some terrible injustice that happened to her. It’s terrifying sometimes."
raisedbyborderlines,fhtdlo9,t1_fht740u,1581873371.0,"Yep, same here. She shows me off to all her friends, gushing how smart I am and how beautiful and hard working, and at home she tells me how I’m a slut and immoral girl who has made too many mistakes to have a good life. (Meanwhile, this sort of confuses me because while she also makes me sound like an alcoholic, drug addict or homeless - when in reality I have a good job, I don’t drink regularly, and have never even smoked pot, nor do I see the relationship she’s referring to with “big mistake” as a big mistake, seeing it’s been a long time since it ended and didn’t leave me much worse for the wear eventually.)"
raisedbyborderlines,fhtd1a5,t3_f4q26x,1581873244.0,"That was a perfect example and explanation, and reminded me very much of my own mother and her love for me. All her reality is filtered through this BPD lens, and it distorts anything she sees into something either terrible or great, no inbetweens."
TwoXChromosomes,fhdvofx,t3_f2gv0z,1581504018.0,"File a complaint against him (via Title IX, for instance) - he already crossed a boundary when insisting on the details, and he behaved in a very unprofessional way after learning said details.

I have told her I don’t want to have children for multiple reasons, but she doesn’t care in the slightest. However, what I’ve found too over the past five years is that she is absolutely horrified whenever she even gets a whiff of me sleeping with someone as long as I’m not married or in a long term relationship. It’s awful. There’s no winning against BPD."
raisedbyborderlines,fcx95cm,t3_ejdfv0,1578056075.0,"This is so me!! My mother does this all the time, especially with her being in pain - she always manages to find a way to tell me how bad a state she is in and how she feels like dying all the time. When I however tell her I’ll go with her to see her doctor (to get properly checked out or to treat her preexisting issues, which are most certainly treatable), she doesn’t want to. Because she’d rather be miserable than give up control."
raisedbyborderlines,f9o8jd8,t3_e62kwe,1575498753.0,"Oh my god, that’s so me. I always lied to cover up that she was ill - I never told the truth about how she threatened suicide when I didn’t behave like the little angel she wanted, or how she yelled and cried when I wanted to go out with friends. So I told people I was meeting others and couldn’t make it. Because my mother was a child I needed to take care of for all my teenage/young adult years."
raisedbyborderlines,f8q9ly2,t3_e1f1m0,1574714259.0,Absolutely same here! I feel like I’ve been mothering my own mother for most of my life - I do not have any desire to further sacrifice my own needs and desires for someone who needs me as the center of their universe.
