I do feel happy from time to time through the few small things that happens in my life, I can't even imagine how it would be to lost it completely. I wish you can somehow gain it back either by yourself or by the help of a shining knight in armour."
depression,fjpjfn0,t1_fjnmie9,1583552422.0,Thank you for your concern. I do feel there are people who's cared for my well-being both irl and online and I'm cared for them. I understand that dying would hurt all of them and that is the last thing I want but I'm still wavering about it. Your kind words are appreciated regardless.

Because I'm genuinely think that my existence serves no purpose and continue living would just be a waste of money and my mental strength. But I still want to drain the very last bit of happiness in my life before my ""deadline""."
