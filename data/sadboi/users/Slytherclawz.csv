How to get out of this loop? I wish I could give you a more ‚Äòon and off‚Äô switch solution. For me, I‚Äôve had to just act on my intuition and see where it goes instead of thinking the opportunity to death. This has personally been to my benefit throughout the years. Studying typologies is also just an excellent way to go. To understand astrology beyond all the bullshit market-driven stereotypes and newspaper horoscopes takes a good bit of study but it has helped me to not go overboard with my Ti and usually confirms my Ni. I study other things as well. Maybe some other forms of psychologically evaluating yourself and others will help overall ü§î

You know part of it my be blurring your own sensations with the sensations of the others since we‚Äôre so chameleonic. That really adds to the anxiety doesn‚Äôt it?! ha... oh god"
ENFP,epq5lzt,t1_epq221e,1559399944.0,"Yes :) I'm so glad you asked this question.  I will say to begin with that my functionalities are kinda funky (get it?) because I lean towards Thinking opposed to Feeling on SO many levels but overall identify as INFJ. I can't speak exactly to your experience but you hit the nail on the proverbial head with the keeping our bullshit away from others tidbit.

A tendency I see in others with the same Type is the inherent love for advancing humanity while innately being turned off by humanity's uglier side. This can make us depressed sometimes and also alienated because it doesn't always seem like everyone else is as agitated/depressed about the same things.

Absorbing energy is frigging crazy and most INFJ I have encountered absorb energy so much that they will just withdraw from communications so suddenly it can even turn others off. I study a lot of things and this helps me deal with it. Otherwise my life would be conquered by anxiety.

INFJ are often spiritual people as well and I notice that they like to get really deep and shun superficiality with spiritual topics. To try and wrap the mind around these beautiful subjects takes years of devoted studying and being alone so that we can process all of this information through our thinking and intuition. This might sound a lil out there but because I absorb so much energy, I have to be alone in order to process it all. I live with an ESTJ who can't understand how anyone can spend as much a time alone as I do and actually enjoy it. I study and write and think and that's all that I need. It's a thing of inner development which I believe many INXJ types feel unfulfilled throughout life without which is apart of introverted intuition. I believe INFJ have a thing for quite consciously finding a friend unlike any other within themselves or developing a bond with their inner voices. Some of us are pickier than others about having this 'relationship' infringed upon even if the infringing is just our perception. Sounds kinda cold despite that many of us tend to be quite 'warm' people, just as you mentioned

Also what you said about our J. Because we can become so focused and attuned to intuition I think many INFJ doorslam, sometimes regrettably so, when we feel like we've outgrown others"
ENFP,epq0mqe,t1_epngx5q,1559396669.0,"Damn you are on point! I give so much that It's fair to say I expect a fair enough back from my friends. Oh that J! Extroverted sensing and all that. I stay extremely focused when others are literally falling asleep. I've had to teach myself to love my independence instead of becoming disappointed with others. And this is also part of why I'm an introvert. Judgement is in no form or fashion a bad thing until it is. Like Bob said, ""Too much of anything is good for nothing."" Judgmentalism itself certainly does manifest in INXJ types who feel extremely alienated from the world and thus bitter. For INFJ it's our introverted thinking defense mechanism replacing our otherwise extroverted feelings. So yeah sometimes it sucks balls.   


I personally can say I don't build walls to keep my friends out. It's more of the opposite away around for me. Maybe because, at least according to Jungian typology, i'm INFJ as opposed to SaphirMeer's INTJ sister. I strongly dislike passive aggression and beating around the bush. Other than that, I do have to come out of 'perfectionist' mode when it comes to human interaction because I can become so persnickety it does my own effing head in. So yeah I do get annoyed by A LOT. I also concur to exuding a me-first attitude in life. Hear mfing hear! but anyone who's known me for a short while can tell I am the opposite of selfish; I think that's also due profoundly to my upbringing which is to say I can't speak for every single INFJ. But yeah, on point."

You need to pursue yourself first. Cliche and easier said than done, sure but it's the truth. You may feel this way about this man now but when you adventure and discover more you may wonder why you ever waited around in the first place.

&#x200B;

Maybe he isn't responding to you as much as you'd like because he's already in a committed relationship but can also sense that you want him and so is trying not to jeopardize what he already has. Maybe he has a whole lot of things on his mind in and consuming his time in general"

infj,epi616u,t3_buqz31,1559235031.0,"My door slams are as respectful or as cold as the person having the door slammed on them. Sometimes I give a sincere, thoughtful explanation. Other times I metaphorically Sparta kick em out the door and chuck the bird as I watch them disappear down into the well. I think this is because of my absorption of energy. There is a certain amount that is wise to receive and rebound gently but If someone tries to spear me with energy then I rebound that energy without grace. 

I don‚Äôt know what the ‚Äòofficial‚Äô answer is but I‚Äôm gonna say when my Fe is encumbered by a lack of having my Se and/or Ni fulfilled I door slam and often recede into my Ti. So if others don‚Äôt give the respect, time, and energy given and therefore expected it makes me withdraw from interacting with my Fe (I‚Äôm quite all or nothing) because it‚Äôs draining feeling let down. Oftentimes this being ‚Äòlet down‚Äô is in the form of friends not maintaining the same desire for growth & evolution (Ni) and/or maintaining a drive to accomplish the plans we put forth together (Se)"

infj,eov6osv,t1_eoultyp,1558889728.0,Had this experience just yesterday with one of my only friends I don‚Äôt have to catch a plane to see. Not to be overlycritical but it‚Äôs as if all I need to do is say the word ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù next to him to make him cringe. I got tired of absorbing his smart alec and sarcastic responses and simply asked him why he feels the need to be a smart alec as soon as he feels he‚Äôs being pressed too closely or even slightly challenged intellectually. His body language immediately tensed and his voice became shaky as a disagreement ensued which was partly argument and partly me showing him it‚Äôs not alright to get defensive or passive aggressive every single time he feels like someone‚Äôs touching his sensitive spots. On the other hand I began practicing how to feel emotions without acting on them or showing what I‚Äôm feeling when I was 14.
infj,eov226x,t3_bt6yl7,1558886959.0,"Yes it is. Some ‚Äòtests‚Äô are more accurate than others. It does well to study multiple psychologies and typologies from the complex to the simple. This can give you a well rounded agglomerate of your self. And don‚Äôt let yourself be fit into a box based on typing üôÇ 

Also ask your closest people what they think you are based on descriptions and functions of the Types. Think of other people who solidly fit INFP or J and compare yourself

I get INFP on this one site while on a more accurate site I continuously get INFJ (mostly) while also being encouraged to look into the INTJ type since I lean strong towards Thinking in the T/F functionality. Because of the other things I‚Äôve studied for years I know that, if I were to allow myself to be put into a box, I‚Äôd select INFJ for sure because of my life experiences and the way I interact with others üôÉ

Look for Frank James on YouTube. He has been one of the only people I‚Äôve encountered to relate to me on levels I didn‚Äôt think others could. I think that if you are able to relate to his INFJ experiences it‚Äôs a pretty good indicator you are INFJ üëçüèæ
