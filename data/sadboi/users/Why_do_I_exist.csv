I try not to, but that's impossible. Comparing yourself to others is human nature. No matter what you do you always feel inferior when you see others succeed because of something out of your control.

Who said I'm not taking care of myself and not putting effort? I workout daily, eat healthy, on my way to earn a college degree and immigrate from a 3rd world shithole. How is that not taking care of yourself? I asked out girls, tried every approach. Being myself, being loud and talkative, assertive, mysterious and distant. I even got straight to the point and asked girls for sex. Nothing worked. You can't fix your height and face. All I wanted is a girl I grow up with and support each other on our ways to success. Not a gold digger or a single mother that suddenly acknowledges your existence when you reach that success. If other guys can have that since they're teens, why not me?
