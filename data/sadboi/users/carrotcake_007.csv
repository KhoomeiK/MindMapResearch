toastme,fl7jmys,t3_fn0vet,1584903103.0,"I remind myself that I can withstand anything for 10 seconds. Then another 10 seconds. And another. I know it doesn't sound like much but it's gotten me through some intense waves. I'm so proud of you for not giving up. You can do anything! You matter. The world needs you. The people in your life love you. Keep taking it one day at a time. I believe in you

BPDmemes,fky3exy,t3_flcz1g,1584640635.0,I'm in this picture and I don't like it
BPDmemes,fkxm9he,t3_fl80hy,1584631078.0,Only time will tell lol
BPD,fkvp236,t3_fkti67,1584573748.0,I've felt this when I'm in the middle of a body dysmorphia spiral. I can't look at myself in the mirror because I don't recognize my face and I can't connect with the person I see. I got triggered by the movie Burlesque the other day. It's never happened before and it's not the first time I've seen the movie. But there I was feeling so insecure and terrible that I had to turn it off. You are beautiful even if your brain can't see it at the time. I'm here for you if you need to talk

BPD,fk6124d,t1_fk5znvz,1583891592.0,That just happened to me actually. I felt more like a project on a to-do list than a person. I thought I was being paranoid so they became my FP anyway
BPD,fk4qxn6,t3_fgh8zj,1583865851.0,This is why I don't like talking about it. People either run away because PerSoNaLitY DiSorDeR or they want to fix me
BPDmemes,fk1tc91,t3_ffw96z,1583786458.0,I feel that in my soul
BPD,fjfsq10,t3_fd0ed9,1583299236.0,For sure. I have that problem with the mirror in my bathroom all the time. I feel like I can't connect with the person I see
niceguys,fbhodpk,t3_edfmsl,1576878493.0,"An ex did the same thing to me. Told me he was in the hospital because he slit his wrist. He blamed me for not loving him and sent a really bloody Google photo. When I freaked he laughed, send it was fake, and said he'd actually just cut his own throat...

Congrats on getting out of there when you did"
toastme,fb6em41,t3_ebmjf5,1576548370.0,I love the color! It looks great on you
toastme,fb1kxq3,t1_fajgnwn,1576438044.0,Why thank you. I bet you look fabulous without makeup! I have a hard time talking about this with my friends or family because I don't want to bother them
toastme,fb0jsj7,t1_fb0bwc6,1576426631.0,"Yes please. I'd really appreciate it. I just can't believe that I fell for it. He seemed so genuinely kind when we first met that by the time I started to feel that something wasn't right, I didn't know how to get out of it"
toastme,fb09750,t1_fajzxiu,1576423867.0,"Thank you! I'm starting an SSRI later this week and I'm optimistic. I know it takes time but I'm so ready to not feel like this before. I've always struggled with feelings of emptiness and figuring everyone would be better off without me but it's gotten worse since October. I was dating someone that I thought I really liked but I found out too late that he was a nice guyTM. By the time I got out of it, I had been emotionally and sexually abused. I've been blaming myself for months because ""how could I be so stupid"" and ""he was right, no one else will 'love' me"". My therapist says that I'm slowly making progress but I'm excited about taking this next step.

Sorry that was probably too much info"
toastme,faxk5cl,t3_easxyr,1576385099.0,Congrats! You're amazing!!
aww,famtbw7,t3_e9wp1g,1576212291.0,I will gladly give him all my money
toastme,famjv1m,t1_falasp2,1576205612.0,"Not gonna lie, you made me sob lol I really needed that today. It was so hard to leave my house to even get to my apartment. I felt so helpless staring at my boots knowing that I had/wanted to put them on and leave but not being able to actually get up and go. I want to prove that I'm not lazy, that I am motivated to get better, and that executive dysfunction really is a thing. I just want to thank you for being here and hearing me"
toastme,fami7n7,t1_fala74w,1576204477.0,Thanks! Being a Disney character would be epic. I thought about auditioning to be a character at Disney for a while but alas I'm too short lol
