It's hard to say whether the economic impact of COVID-19 will be worse than the deaths. I think, on balance, that the economic impact of the deaths would be about the same (or worse) as the economic impact of avoiding those deaths.  
I'm part of a research group that studies social reorganization events with and without population collapse both historically and prehistorically. In general, whether or not a society will reorganize seems to be a function of its robustness--roughly speaking, a society's ability to absorb or deflect catastrophic events--and resilience--a society's ability to rebound from catastrophic events, usually through transformation, but sometimes bouncing back without much change in day-to-day operations. Robustness and resilience are trade-offs because they consume resources. The fewer resources available, the more change is necessary to recover when a society's robustness fails to adequately dampen the event.  
The problem is, the larger a society becomes, the more resources it consumes in ensuring robustness against specific and predictable catastrophes.  
The US had institutions in place to be very robust against pandemics. Unfortunately, those institutions were systematically dismantled beginning in about 2016. The result is a tradeoff between currency and human capital. Arguably, costs in human capital weight more than costs in currency, but the losses can be equivalent. In fact, under capitalism, the costs in currency and human capital are weighed against the benefits, and the optimal exchange is presumably met.  
So we can assume, generally, that the economy losses are optimized not only when some amount of life is sacrificed for currency, but also when some amount of currency is sacrificed for life--so long as the amount of each being sacrificed is sensitive to demand.  
The real question is how much do we need to change in the system from prior to the pandemic in order to stabilize our society?  
If we look at catastrophes in the US over time--the San Francisco earthquake, hurricane Katrina, the WTC bombings, etc--and examine the efficiency of response--things like the cost and duration of rebuilding--we see that the US has become somewhat less resilient over time. This is partially due to the growth of income inequality since 1980, and partially due to the costs of operating our society. As a result, some amount of social reorganization is required to rebound from this pandemic. The US *should* examine what the society needs in order to function appropriately and respond to those need with structural institutional changes... for example, new social support programs and some means of paying for them (usually taxation, but that's one institution; can we imagine other options?).  
My concern is that the current administration is too rigidly focused on maintaining status quo. The real loss to our economy won't be the deaths and financial costs we bear as a result of COVID-19, but a complex decline resulting from a failure to change our institutions to address functional deficiencies we can identify during this period of hardship."

Now that you have your two equations, solve for `n` in one of them. Having done that, substitute `n` in your second equation with the expression from the first equation and solve for `x`.
  
It's much more difficult to make mistakes if you follow this procedure.

Jokes,fm2hax5,t1_fm1ugqb,1585697468.0,"In English, a preposition is a word that shows a relationship between two nouns. These are words like *for, to, with, against, between, on,* and so forth. It's technically not an error to end a sentence with a preposition, but it annoys people who consider it a hard-fast rule, and it's somewhat less formal.  
  
A dangling participle describes a term used in a sentence that modifies a noun to which the participle isn't connected. Consider the sentence, ""Falling from the sky, I saw a blue light.""  Was I falling from the sky, or was the blue light?  
  
In the joke, the question ""What was the 1-2-3 for?"" ends in a preposition. Formally, this sentence would be, ""For what was the 1-2-3?"" but it doesn't sound very elegant.  
There is no real dangling participle in the joke, but because 'for' is pronounced like the number 'four,' the man is left with *something* dangling.   
  
The second punchline approximates a double entendre, but isn't truly a double entendre because ending the question with a preposition doesn't truly result in a dangling participle; participle serves only as an unconventional euphemism for 'penis' in this joke."

Nor is it a stretch of the imagination to assume that without appropriate action, every adult will get sick. This is a ""novel"" virus. Our immune systems don't currently have anything pre-built to combat it and prevent us from ""catching"" it. Our immune systems cannot suppress the infection fast enough for it to not become contagious in an infected individual.  
  
I'm not panicking or trying to cause panic. The way you're presenting the information in a way that suggests people shouldn't care and shouldn't distance themselves socially or shelter-in-place.  
  
My primary interest in this conversation is to point out that we do need to put these measures into action in our own lives to slow the spread. Without these measures, mortality rates in these other nations would be significantly higher.  
  
The fact is that as the death tally increases, more people will panic and commit suicide. Our best option is to keep calm and shelter-in-place.

I think that claim would need a citation, too.  
But imagine if absolutely nobody practiced social distancing. In 2010, the US had [~113 million people between the ages of 18 and 44](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiT0eLilLboAhXbWM0KHT9jD5IQFjABegQIZRAI&usg=AOvVaw11ZaHiC5nQSvDVUHdPzuAt).  
COVID-19 has a fatality rate of [0.2%](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/) (deaths/cases) for people in each decadal cohort from 10 to 50 years old.  
0.2% of 113 million is 226 thousand.  
If nobody decided to stay at home, it's safe to assume that everyone in the US would be exposed in a matter of weeks (if US population is 327.2 million and each person only spread it to 2 other people, it would only have to spread ~29 times to get everyone sick). If every ""young person"" (18-44) caught the disease (whether cases are staggered or simultaneous), we could expect 226 thousand deaths for this age cohort in the US, and significantly more due to an overwhelmed healthcare system. On top of that, nearly half (48%) of all american adults have cardiovascular disease, which is one of the pre-existing conditions associated with higher risk of death due to COVID-19.

theydidthemath,fl1s2bj,t1_fl0tpb9,1584735121.0,"For people who have a difficult time imagining how far this is, I can describe it to what is probably a weirdly narrow subset of you.  
  
If your town was developed for agriculture, the length of your square-shaped block is probably 1/8 of a mile on each side (~201 m... blocks were designed around the length of a furrow, or 1 furlong in agricultural townships; this standardization is why I can reach some subset of people). 148 m is almost 3/4 of that distance (148 m = 0.736 furlongs).   
  
Imagine you are standing at the intersection of main and center, and your friend is standing directly in front of the house numbered seventy-something (odd or even, take your pick). If the house numbers skip from 60 to 80, then in-between the two houses. This is roughly the distance of 148 m."

But I think what u/something693 is saying is that maybe these people aren't eating the onion. Maybe they're thinking they're making a clever comment and y'all got woooshed by their satire.  
Think about it... every one of their comments is technically true.  
  
That said, I have no way of knowing whether they think they're being clever or actually ate the onion. I have both kinds of people on my timeline... and I think the ones who think they're being clever actually *are* being clever, but only because people who say these sorts of things (and would respond this way) *actually exist.*  
  
I dunno man, tough call.  
  
Edit: note the distinct lack of any reactions to the main Facebook post other than thumbs-up and laughing. The only mad faces are in the comments... I think they're definitely doing satire."
