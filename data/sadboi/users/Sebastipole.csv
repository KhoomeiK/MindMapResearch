SDAM,folcze4,t3_g7kvac,1587859597.0,"Sounds like we had a very identical childhood, if I didn't know any better I'd say I wrote this post and forgot about it!

I've been diagnosed with CPTSD, major depressive disorder and social anxiety and I'm a total Aphant, crazy how identical our situation is.

Father and mother dragged our family around the country, constantly moved from school to school growing up with domestic physical and verbal abuse in the immediate family, I was also sexually abused when my mother left me and my brother/sister were left with some random family (I really don't remember much as to why this happened)

I have some form of memory issues, partially related to the CPTSD growing up, it's been proven that growing up with trauma effects brain development to cope with trauma, specifically hippocampus, and the pre-frontal cortex. This was helpful while growing up to cope, forget, move on and survive but once we reach adulthood, when our brains development slows, and stops its very difficult to change the pathways that our brain has developed that cause the memory issues, but not impossible to resolve.

I don't know your full situation but if you haven't, I really recommend you find a psychologist that you trust that can help you work through these past experiences, as well a an understanding GP. I'm still early into my treatment, which has taken me a long time to seek help for, I'm 28, had multiple psychologists, psychritrists and GP's but I've always flaked out from treatment at some point for various reasons, be it work, social or family, but now I'm finally in a position that's allowing me to care for myself properly and it's made a huge difference to my well-being, memory, depression and general outlook on life.

Right now I'm doing 16/8, focusing on eating an appropriate amount of protein, macro/micro nutrients, almost zero processed food, all fresh veg with a small serving of meat, fish, lamb, chicken whatever I feel like cooking.

Keep note of the positives that are happening around you, no matter how small.

At the end of the day I'll reflect back, or the week whenever I'm feeling down and unmotivated and see the progress I've made or that I've had positive experiences recently.

Don't be afraid to talk to your friends either, isolating yourself will only hurt you more, trust me, I've got a lot of experience at that and never, not once has disconnecting from my friends ever been beneficial to me at all.
