I dont like hc because i dont like dying and having to redo all the time lost. I dont like trading either so i always play SSF SC.

Honestly noone will give a flying F what you play 😉"

Lots of times minions just stand around. Some bosses (p2 lambach) they dont attack at all. Archers+mage golem shoot into walls. We really need icons at the bottom for the minions (number+health perhaps). Collision/hitboxxes are terrible. Zombies are squishie af. All minion ai is slow af.

Trying to build block/life and the minion nodes ofc.

Feels like minions were added as an afterthought.. they need a loooot of work!"
