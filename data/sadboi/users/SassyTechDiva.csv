My mind wasn’t spinning on the negative things. I wasn’t constantly trying to process interactions I had with people...it was like my brain forgot it had depression.

I had a similar situation the other night. Reach out to 4 friends (reaching out to 1 is hard enough for me to do but I was in a bad way) to help me talk it through; 1 never answered, one answered then threw his new relationship in my face then quickly retreated, a 3rd inquired then disappeared but the 4th one made me feel like they actually gave a shit. “I wish I knew what to say.”
