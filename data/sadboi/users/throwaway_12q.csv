It may feel irrelevant now because everyone you're comparing yourself to is the same age.

What I mean by ""easier"" is something like medication. It's a good way treat depression, but, after finding the right one, it's as easy as eating food. It's just popping a pill everyday, and consistency is the key for any kind of treatment, whether it's daily exercise, daily journaling, and etc.

After more than a decade of depression, I'm looking for something else that can be a quickly available crutch to put me on the right path. I'm exhausted and my hope is nearly gone. It's a last ditch effort to save myself from the worst. Hahha... sorry, that was dark."

Like I said, my outlook for the future is getting bleaker and bleaker everyday. If there is a way to find a ""shortcut"" solution (even if it is to briefly improve my mood and outlook enough to provide a jumpstart in establishing good habits), I want that. 

By ""shortcut"", I mean something as simple as taking medication. Like lifting weights everyday can be difficult, but I know I can put on gym shorts everyday. I just need a different kind of help right now aside from conventional advice.

I read an article in the New Yorker about studies being done at Johns Hopkins with minimal doses of psilocybin in controlled environments (eg monitoring by a therapist, mood music, blindfold, etc...). The results were pretty promising.

But the fear for me is that I've had hypomanic episodes that were triggered by heavy marijuana use. I'm not sure if it was the marijuana or the fact that I was smoking it every waking moment, but I know I don't want another episode. 

I get that psilocybin is a different chemical, but when you're comparing a hallucinogen and a mood altering substance, it's hard to not be more afraid of the hallucinogen.

depression,fdo9lii,t1_fdo7iki,1578601259.0,"Yeah I see your point. I guess what I’m asking might be pointing more towards what some would call a shortcut solution.

I consider medication to be a shortcut solution. What I mean by that is the effort it takes to consume the medication versus the possible upside (eg. elevation in mood, improvement in outlook, etc) is so low in comparison to CBT. 

For CBT to work, patients must go to therapy consistently and practice methodically healthier thinking and self awareness. Depending on the severity of depression, it can be an arduous process. Compared to popping some pills, CBT is quite involved. *Of course, finding the right medication is a journey in and of itself, but I also liken this to finding the right therapist. 

So my question was regarding a form of treatment that targets the brain whether through electrical stimulation or some other chemical means to rewire it."

As someone who's posted here, I've received a few PMs that started off with the usual: ""Hey, how are you? I felt like you needed to talk to someone.""

I really appreciated the sentiment, but it felt like a forced interaction. Not without care or consideration, but catered specifically to be a body to talk to and knowing the intention behind it, ironically made me feel obligated to politely respond, but pussyfooted (for a lack of a better word) in my attitude. 

This is only because I know it's a sincere, but more importantly, an instantly sympathetic reaction to a sad post. It's not something I expect to be a meaningful, lasting relationship, but one born for a moment out of immediate sympathy. Like a hand on the shoulder. 

I do appreciate them. I really do, but I also can do without it, and like the moderators here have said, comments are all I need. Commiserating, advice for me or anybody relating to the OP, or a simple upvote to show support is really all I'm looking for.

I graduated from college as a Biochem major pretty late at 27 years old. I don't really have any hobbies right now. I used to be interested in dance and music. I currently binge watch YouTube, binge eat, and lie in bed 24/7. 

I currently live with my family, and I have an okay relationship with them. They're very worried about me and have absolutely no idea whether to kick me out of the house or to continue supporting me. I used to have friends, but I have isolated myself completely as of 4 months ago. I had a few hypomanic episodes and did some incredibly insane things (ie. got naked in front of my friends, started fights on the street, put myself into debt, etc) that embarrassed me completely. I rarely go outside unless I absolutely have to for appointments with my psychiatrist. Just being outside makes me very anxious. 

It's never been this bad. I just have a lot of shame about how little I've accomplished and the mistakes I made when I was manic.
