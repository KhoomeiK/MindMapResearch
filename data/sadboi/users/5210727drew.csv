personalfinance,fj5vpci,t3_fbpoy7,1583044875.0,"I think it depends on how important your time is. I buy coffee every morning, and I also buy my lunch, but I know that I am able to be so much more work if I get an extra 30 minutes of sleep and wake up early to make my coffee. I value convenience, and being able to work a little bit more efficiently because I will make more money, and not use that time making lunch or coffee. Just me though. However, if things were to be tight, I would prep at home."

After mortgages, taxes, and insurance, I probably spend about $2500 a month on general expenses like eating out or travel. This is the spending group that I’ve been having some trouble cutting back on."
