nonmonogamy,f7hpoya,t3_dwagsh,1573745255.0,"We made a pact to die at eachothers' side. No matter who we meet,  however much we change, what our environment looks like, we will always choose to be there for eachother and our family. Some years may be dreadful and maybe we cannot stand the sight of eachother but the bigger picture and the higher power always trump the negative feelings which spring up. Don't sweat the small stuff,(it's all small stuff.) If someone else would be willing to accept one of us leaving the other and causing pain and turmoil in the hearts of several children, then that would not be love on their part but malicious selfishness. Neither of us could stay with a person like that and they would probably get reamed a new one and kicked to the curb for suggesting it. Ours is a business partnership as well as a friendship and romantic relationship and the company's stability is of utmost importance because of all who rely on it."

The groundhog breathing technique also works for me...sometimes! I sympathize though. When my husband goes on dates they have to be during the day or early evening because we practice family bed with our kids and they would also be anxious during the night to know where daddy was. We have discussed sleepovers and the only way to stabilize the environment would be to send us all to a hotel,  thats two hotels for one night lol. There's no way we could afford that.

FWB to a lot of younger people just means fuck buddies and we dont share intimate personal stuff with each other. Text messages are solely to schedule hook ups and not talk about our day or just call for no reason.  That's awkward for everybody, partners included.

It would be important to establish what to do with our finances (i.e. split mine from his, remove joint credit accounts,) if someone were to come after child support so we do not endanger our family financially. We barely make rent as is. Also, what living arrangements, ( I would prefer new mom to move in with us or get a bigger place jointly, etc. and if not then time arrangements would get very sticky with 3 kids needs as opposed to one and need a lot of tweeking. ) Other than planning for the worst case, we dont have a written contract, just agreememts."

Just because you develop a deeper connection with one person and hold them closer doesn't have to take away from other relationships if the others know the drill. My partner and my goal is to die at eachothers' side and there's nothing wrong with our desire or our choices which would enable that to happen. Indeed, ALL relationships end, til death do us part is a thing. One should not be chastised for living their truth the way they see fit if it doesnt cause harm to anyone.

All outside lovers are FWB at most or ONS. We work constantly and have kids so at the most we have time to see lovers twice a month and that's if we're lucky. tbh its more like a half a dozen or so times a year.
