depression,fqpfm4b,t3_gk7mgh,1589545138.0,"Hey, thanks for your well written post, it’s very relatable. For me it’s an ongoing struggle to balance honesty with being ‘fun’. I think some level of openness is needed; if you have to pretend all the time then the friendship will just cost you a lot of energy. However I have learned that being too honest can indeed scare people away or make them find you annoying and exhausting. Im not sure where the ‘cutoff point’ is. 
I try to be excited for my friends and interested in them even when I feel very bad myself, but I dont think it’s enough for them.
So sorry I don’t have a clear answer for you but you’re not alone!"

depression,fkafwx8,t3_fhbysc,1584006243.0,"I’m sorry for you, that sucks! Guy, girl, dog, alien; you are allowed to have feelings! Sometimes life’s just shitty, that has nothing to do with gender. I’m proud you took the step to share this with us. It was perfectly legible, and this is a good place to vent, so feel free to just write it all down here if it helps!"
depression,fkafqbz,t3_fhcgwj,1584005999.0,"Congratulations on graduating, that’s an amazing achievement! I understand you’re feeling lost right now and unsure about what the future might bring. It must feel hopeless for you, Im sorry. From an outsiders perspective I see someone with a lot of potential though! You have a degree, you are motivated and willing to work; you just need a place to land your feet and get started. I hope you find one soon!"
depression,fkafk5j,t3_fhcmpa,1584005769.0,"It sounds like you have a lot on your plate, no wonder you feel overwhelmed! I’m happy you’re taking steps in the right direction by going to counseling. Unfortunately it takes time to work. It’s hard putting in effort when you dont see results. I hope you can keep it up a bit longer. A fucking random from the internet is cheering for you :)!"
depression,fkaf8hs,t3_fhcuhf,1584005336.0,"Congrats on going to college, that’s awesome :) The housing situation does sound shitty, I’m sorry. It’s totally ok to cry for a bit, you are allowed to feel sad about it."
depression,fkaf5jb,t3_fhcwhu,1584005228.0,"I’m sorry, you must feel awful to neglect yourself like that! How about a little step today? If a full shower is too much, maybe a quick washcloth or wash your face? You deserve personal care!"

depression,fjlo9ig,t3_fe2ral,1583450721.0,"Im on 60mg fluoxetine against depression and for mood stabilization and it has really helped. It took quite a while to find the right one, but Im happy I kept trying. I still have offdays and winter is hard, the cold and the dark affect my mood a lot. But its better. Not perfect, maybe not even ‘good’. But better."
depression,fjlny7u,t3_fe2ssw,1583450518.0,"You are completely right; it is hard to respond to this! I see that youre hurting and that emotions are running rampant. That must suck so hard for you! I dont have an answer or a solution to your pain, I wish I did.  Thanks for taking the effort to write this and giving us some insight in your depressive state. Im sure lots of people can relate!"
depression,fjln6az,t3_fe3vvp,1583450020.0,"That sounds like quite the mood switch! That must not have been nice to experience, im sorry for that.
Sounds like you were doing great the last few weeks, thats awesome! It’s ok to have an off day where you question the point of it all.  Allow yourself to feel the emotion, then try to pick up the pace where you left off. You did it for 2 weeks, thats great! Be proud of that!"
depression,fjlmqtl,t1_fjkqfqw,1583449749.0,"Im happy to hear that! Yeah those meds kinda suck but hopefully they can help calm your thoughts for a bit. For me the numbness subsided somewhat, hopefully they do for you too. ‘Never’ sounds so big, try to focus on today and now. You are here, and you have people around you who love you. Thats awesome! I wish you all the best for your recovery"
depression,fjjscam,t3_fdrd0n,1583410587.0,It sucks that you feel this way. It’s hard to not overthink the past and keep thinking what you couldve done differently. I’m sorry you feel lonely :(
depression,fjjs5h6,t3_fds87f,1583410401.0,"Losing people close to you sucks. The hardest thing might be that youre hurting so much and you dont know if they are too, if they miss you or if theyve moved on."
depression,fjjs18j,t3_fdscih,1583410278.0," Not about coming back to life, but I have imagined being able to see the aftermath of my death. People seem to forget your suicidal episodes quickly, like they werent serious. Or maybe they just dont care. So yeah, sometimes I imagine being a ghost at my funeral and yelling ‘IS IT REAL ENOUGH FOR YOU NOW?!’ 

I’m glad youre still here after your attempt two weeks ago. How are you today?"
depression,fjjrs6f,t3_fdshsv,1583410028.0,I’m sorry you feel this way :( you dont sound boring at all; quite the opposite! You seem to have a sensitive and creative mind and your words touched me! Have you ever thought about writing or doing something creative?

Yeah, the couple can invite whoever they want, but of course their choices have consequences and can hurt the people around them.  So are they ‘wrong’? No, maybe not. But that doesnt mean it wasnt a dick move!

How does your boyfriend feel about this?"

depression,fiq4juj,t3_f97im7,1582634876.0,"It sucks, but sometimes our emotions do get the best of us.  You sound like you have a lot bottled up, so no wonder that at some point it just bursts out. Try to find a way to let it out in a healthier way before you lose control. Go running, draw your feelings, go to the middle of the forest and scream as loud as you can. If you find something that works for you, you can prevent lashing out at your SO like that in the future. Best of luck!"
