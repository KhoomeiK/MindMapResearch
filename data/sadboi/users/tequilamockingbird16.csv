I know in my state, Illinois, the Board of Education has changed their standards/requirements for graduation. Now, even if a student doesn't meet their required hours, the decision as to whether or not the student is adequately prepared and should graduate on time is left up to the individual university. My university has been working with current interns to get them virtual training sessions and access to PD's, and as far as I know everyone is still on track to graduate as scheduled."
schoolcounseling,fqr5yys,t3_gjbc3k,1589578220.0,"I am currently in grad school, on track to graduate and start applying for jobs next spring. I am definitely worried about finding a job, as well. One thing I have going for me is that I live in a really big city that has a huge school district, and I know from researching that there are frequently job openings posted throughout the whole school year. Just because I apply/interview does not mean I will get the job, of course.

My plan is to do everything I possibly can to graduate in spring 2021 (as opposed to August or December), so that I have the whole summer to apply and interview for jobs. That's when most of the hiring happens for the next school year. I'm also going to be open minded. That may mean applying to suburban districts, charter and private schools, etc. At least in my district, my supervisors have told me that there are typically far more elementary positions than high school, so that's another piece to be cognizant of. Luckily, I am equally open to both elementary or high school positions."

Most of my profs have been saying ""hope to see you in the fall for in-person classes"" but several of them have added that there is a real probability we'll be online again and to prepare for that. I doubt Loyola will make the official call until much closer to term start. Personally, I am in a small grad program and most of my classes are around 10 people. My hope is that they will say if your class is small enough to maintain social distance in the fall, you can resume on campus. If the class is a lecture with 75+ people, then perhaps those have to stay online. We'll see."
girls,fot9ra8,t3_g17jkw,1588048006.0,"Yeah, similar for me. I watched the first handful of seasons back when I was in college and my early 20's, now I'm in my late 20's and am rewatching during the shutdown. I related to Hannah a lot when I watched the early seasons because I am also a chubby writer gal. I didn't like her character exactly and knew she was really cringe, but it took until my second rewatch to realize that literally *all* of the characters are awful people. And I think that's the point. You're supposed to see a piece of yourself in them and, like, yikes. Which... yeah, check.

I also was really heartbroken over the Hannah/Adam drama and split, and very much 'shipped' them and wanted them to end up together back when I first watched. Now after rewatching, I still enjoy their relationship but I don't see them as endgame. They were a great 'first love' story, and they helped make each other into the people they eventually grew into.

I also laugh so much harder at so much of this show... it really encapsulates dating in your 20's. I've had more of those experiences now than I did when I first watched, so I find a lot of the sex scenes and couplings hysterical because it's like... Oh, I totally knew a Charlie/Marnie couple. I totally had my 'Adam'. etc."

Soooo yes, same boat as you - hardly anyone is consistently doing the work. It's frustrating, but I also get why it has to be this way and can't really think of a better solution we could've implemented on such short notice. I work in a district with many low SES students who did not have access to computers/wifi/etc, who are caring for younger siblings or working, who have family members who have COVID, etc. So it doesn't feel right to penalize them if they can't get it done.

I will say, in the last week the district has stepped up and delivered computers to loads of kids who didn't have them before, and that has been a game changer. I'm seeing kids login to Google Classroom who haven't at all so far. I guess we'll see if it keeps up or not."

schoolcounseling,fn2a5rz,t3_fs287b,1586582261.0,"As an aside, I am rewatching the show Friday Night Lights right now, and one of the main characters, Tami, makes it sound like she just wandered into the high school one day and out of the blue they just offered her the job of school counselor! I'm watching and I'm like, ummm this is Texas. Sis needs two years of teaching experience and her damn master's. None of that is ever mentioned/part of the character's background. \~\*School counselor problems\*\~"
schoolcounseling,fn29ng9,t1_fn0qx9v,1586581819.0,"Yeah, like I said I don't think it's impossible to be a good school counselor without a teaching background (and clearly that's the way the field is shifting, so...), but I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on how integral a teaching background is. I agree, counseling isn't teaching. But *school* counseling and teaching overlap an awful lot.

I look at it kind of like a principal. Almost any principal program that I know of requires \[x\] years of teaching experience first. Teacher and Principal are entirely different jobs. Totally different set of skills and job descriptions. But as a teacher (and as a school counselor!) I would *never* want to work for a principal who hadn't been a teacher first. It would be tough to take their advice and evaluation of my performance seriously, knowing they've never been on the business end of 30 chatty 7th graders whom they need to teach a complex lesson to. Reminds me of a Brene Brown quote: ""Unless you're also in the arena getting your ass kicked, I'm not interested in your feedback.""

Obviously teacher to principal and teacher to counselor are different scenarios, I just use that to illustrate why I think sometimes it is vital in education to hold a particular type of job before you hold a different position.

While I taught, I learned classroom management skills, discipline, realistic relationship building with challenging students, and lesson planning - all vital to a school counselor's role. I do not think you can adequately learn those difficult skills, which need to be practiced nearly constantly, through an internship experience. Not to the same level. I would also feel totally lost, personally, navigating the climate and political game that is unique to schools without my four years of experience working in them previously. I recall some of the things my classmates in my program will say and just thinking to myself, ""Uh. That's *not* how that conversation with your principal would really go. Sounds nice, but doesn't work like that."" I already have a working knowledge of class scheduling, administrative portals, FERPA, IEPs and 504s, etc etc. Sure it can be taught in a class, but that just doesn't compare to living it. Personally, I love my counseling program but it focuses a lot on philosophies of counseling and big concepts and not a ton on the actual day-to-day realities of the job. I feel I have such a better handle on that part as a former teacher, and frankly, I worry for some of my classmates who I think are going into this very wide-eyed and are going to be smacked with a harsh reality on their first day. I think it can be hard to really know what you're getting into without experience working in a school/teaching first, and ultimately I think some of these folks will spend 2 years and however many $$$ on a degree just to find out it's not what they thought and not the right fit. I don't have those concerns.

Anyway, those are my 2 cents. Like I said, most states are shifting away from this requirement anyway so not like it matters much! It's my advice for an aspiring school counselor - yours to take or leave."
schoolcounseling,fn0o0m0,t1_flzg4hd,1586545480.0,"I guess this is an unpopular opinion, but I don't think its illogical at all to expect school counselors to have teaching experience first. That was the requirement in my state for many years and it has only recently changed. I am one of two former teachers in my cohort and let's just say it really, really shows. I feel so much more confident and like I understand what I'm getting into, because of my teaching experience and work in a school. I don't think it's *impossible* to be a good school counselor without teaching experience, I just know I can't imagine how overwhelmed I would feel right now (ending my first year of an MEd program) if I didn't have it."
schoolcounseling,fn0msdl,t3_fu5m5s,1586544825.0,"1. I would say that good schools are looking for: experience working with kids/in a school/in some sort of mentorship programing, a decent GPA, and good letters of rec. On the whole, I believe school counseling program admissions are more holistic than other grad programs tend to be.
2. Yes, I would make sure you have experience like I detailed above on your application/resume. I was a teacher for 2 years. If I didn't have that experience, I would certainly focus on getting a job in a school because it gives you a much more realistic picture of what your work life will be like and what it's like to work with students. Some people like subbing, and more power to them. I'd throw out working as a paraprofessional as an alternate option (that's what I do now as I'm going through my grad program).
3. CACREP accreditation and its importance depends on the specific degree you're getting and what you want your options to be. Personally my degree is an MEd in School Counseling and I only want to work in schools; I have no interest in mental health counseling/private practice/etc. CACREP doesn't matter then.

One last note: personally, I would avoid a for-profit institution like the plague."
schoolcounseling,fn0lxmi,t3_fwl6la,1586544374.0,"Hey there. I think you should certainly apply! Be open minded and apply to as many programs as you feel comfortable with/can afford to. Any good school counselor knows that schools DO NOT just care about GPA and grades anymore. Absolutely address some of the challenges you've faced, how you've overcome them, and how they've only made you stronger and more committed to your goal to become a school counselor and help other students overcome their own challenges. Personal statement or an essay is the perfect time to address that.

Also, what kind of experience do you have working with students, in a school, or in a mentorship/counseling-esque program? In my experience, this is actually much more important than having a sky high GPA."

schoolcounseling,fmttsbb,t3_fwykat,1586378874.0,"Personally, as someone who attends an in-person program that has recently switched to online learning because of COVID-19, I cannot imagine doing a fully online program. In just a few weeks, I've felt the quality of my education drop in each course and it's frustrating. Professors keep mentioning ""Oh, we were going to do this activity... but we can't really do it effectively online, unfortunately."" Most of my classes were discussion based and a few of them still attempt it over zoom, but it is just not the same. Online discussions are much more awkward - you can't always see who you're responding to, people interrupt one another, it just isn't as impactful. Often these discussions have been turned into PowerPoint/lectures, and those just aren't as engaging. I find myself being distracted by other things and zoning out. I very much miss my in person classes and hope they can be reinstated in the fall for my second and final year of the program.

Granted - the program I attend was not meant to be taken online and my professors have had to unexpectedly transition to e-learning, so a program that is intentionally online may be different. I understand that it is much more convenient and potentially more cost efficient, so the right choice is different for everyone. It's just been my experience that in person learning is much more engaging, lends itself better to networking and making connections with my professor and classmates, and actually teaches me more."

badroommates,fkow2or,t3_fjerjy,1584396291.0,"I recently discovered that my roommate has been using my Keurig coffee pods (that shit is expensive!!). Keep in mind that (1) She never asked if she could use my coffeemaker in the first place, and (2) I keep all my foodstuffs in my personal kitchen drawer, coffee pods included. That means she went digging through my food drawer in order to help herself to those. Rude.

Long story short, I now keep my coffee in my bedroom. The same girl never bought a roll of toilet paper in the 3 months she's now lived here, and I got sick of asking her to pitch in so now I also keep my toilet paper in my room, and carry it back and forth to the bathroom with me. It's just mind boggling to me how some people were raised...

In your case... tough to keep frozen veggies in your room lol. I'd write your name on everything as others have suggested, and perhaps she will get the hint. Then I'd wait and see if it happens again. Maybe it was a one off or a mistake. If it does happen again, then a conversation is definitely in order. I'd be pissed."
