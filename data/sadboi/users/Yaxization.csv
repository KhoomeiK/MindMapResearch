NoFap,eydgi4i,t1_eydfuyr,1567018248.0,"absolutely no regrets, I'm a better and happier person but not due to the fact that I'm not watching porn all day.. of course I had more time to spend on other things.. but I don't think that no fap worked for those goals. 

hitting the gym and reading books really helped me to get into relations , find new people and start to love myself.. but I think I could reach those goal event without no fap"
NoFap,eydg4hs,t1_eyddr60,1567018062.0,"after those years I reach the conclusion that not masturbating is not affecting my life at all.. no one now that I'm on no fap, no one treats me differently , I feel exactly the same (except on first month trial.. I was convinced that not beating the meat will transform me into a sort of super man.. but guess what? after 2 years... nothing changed at all

sry for my English"
NoFap,eydfv6s,t1_eydfoyx,1567017935.0,nope but not beating your dick will not change absolutely nothing dude..
