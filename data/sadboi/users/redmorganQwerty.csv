Dissociation,fgpvxue,t3_ezumzy,1581013046.0,"You sound desperate, first you have to acknowledge that, that desperation or another feeling that you can have. That's always the first step. The second is to know that the symptom's doesn't disappear in two or three weeks, for me it take almost one year but gradually you'll get better. Thirds is that often you'll feel worsa than before and that is normal, most of the mental illness work like that, they are cyclical. Four if you live in a place were you feel you emotion invalidated , defend your feelings, they are valid , being sad is not bad, being loss it hurts but you gonna get thru this.
Finally exercise yourself. Push ups , jogging, etc. If it make you sweat is better. Remember you're not death yet"
