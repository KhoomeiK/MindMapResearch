It was only when he started stepping on everyone's toes and wouldn't give anyone any creative room that they took him away from any decision making that didn't involve toys.

MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fb758t7,t1_fb74x6c,1576574637.0,You must have missed the entire campaign against CM that started months before the movie came out. The bombarding of negative reviews were not from people who had seen the movie. They were organised by troll groups after Brie Larson did an interview where she rightly pointed out that there needs to be diversity among film critics because not every movie's target audience is white men. Incel groups went to war on review sites. It was literally all over the internet. I'm seriously amazed you missed it.
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fb74dd2,t1_fb73aa0,1576573258.0,"Exactly. Specifically because trolls bombarded it with negative reviews before anyone had seen it - the movie hadn't even come out yet.

My dad still let him back outside, but he started basically spending more and more time around his property and with him (my dad gardens in his spare time so the cat would hang out with him). One day the neighbours were moving and my dad was really worried but then the neighbours apparently approached him and said they know the cat prefers to be with my dad so he can keep him if he wants. I say apparently because I wouldn't put it past my dad to just keep the cat inside until the neighbours had no choice but to leave without him lol all my dad's cats before and since have been ones he's found off the street, so he has a soft spot for cats in need."

I've had to change my mindset albeit in a different context - when my now hubby and I started dating, my self insteem took a massive nosedive. If I saw an attractive woman around us, I'd get incredibly jealous, and if I saw my hubby glance at her I'd get upset. I knew it was incredibly toxic, and while I kept my thoughts to myself, I knew I couldn't live like this, so one thing I started doing was: when I saw an attractive lady I'd switch my thought immediately to something complimentary. I'd think ""wow she has incredibly nice hair. I wonder who her hairdresser is."" Or ""she has great legs, it's good that she makes time to go to the gym and look after herself."" 

It took time but it bloody worked. If a parade of naked chicks walked past us now, I wouldn't care in the slightest. Good on them for being so confident in their skin.

I'll add that I was first diagnosed with depression at age 12, so I often think my disinterest in learning to drive had a lot to do with that. It may have been a factor for Macin too. I imagine if I lived in an area where public transport wasn't easily accessible that my parents would likely have pressed the issue, much like Macin's seemed to."

I had consistently tracked my cycle for almost two years at this point and I assumed I knew my cycle. Our bodies do weird things. If you want to minimise your chances of conception then rely on birth control, don't rely on your wife's body consistently behaving the way you expect it to because mother nature is a bitch."
relationships,f5vg2yq,t3_dpd5sm,1572488535.0,Your request is completely reasonable. My hubby and I both got tested before we started having sex early in our relationship. Let him be offended. Regular STD testing should just be something anybody who is sexually active does. It's just part of maintaining your health (as well as the health of future partners).
AskReddit,f5s05vg,t3_dotgmd,1572407467.0,"My hubby's cousins, only it's mummy's money. Mum (hubby's aunt) is an incredibly hard working woman in her 60s and a self-made multimillionaire. Kids are in their 30s and wouldn't have a single thing to write on their resumes. House bought for each at 18, a high weekly allowance, plus all bills covered by mum. I once stayed with the daughter for a few days as I had a specialist appointment in the area and it was literally just drugs and alcohol around the pool there 24/7. She had a cpl friends living with her who also didn't have to work, she paid whatever they needed so that they'd stay home with her and she wouldn't be lonely during normal working hours."
Pets,f5pi56g,t3_dooa4j,1572359937.0,"My almost 20 year old boy has done this since he was 6 months old (also neutered). I honestly tried everything. Every vet I saw swore by those pheromone sprays (feliway) but he just pissed on the wall dispensers. They put him on antidepressants when he got a bit older and while it helped lessen the amount of pissing, I'd still find spots. I ended up getting a cat enclosure built along the side of my house. He loves it and has shelter out there, a garden, sunlight, and tends to keep his pissing on the fence out there. He has house access but it is restricted, so while I'm still cleaning up after him, it's in a contained area that is easier to handle. Beats randomly coming across his piss spots by me or the kids walking through the puddles. After 20 years of this, I understand all too well the frustration."

I honestly think they expected nothing but praise and the criticism seriously took them by surprise. I dislike the whole ""we gave up 10 years of our life,"" like I'm not sure what they expected when they decided to take on a mammoth story like this? It speaks volumes about why we got such a rushed ending."
UnresolvedMysteries,f5jftux,t1_f5it9sd,1572227349.0,">You'd have to be crazy to have gotten away with murder, successfully hidden the body and then attempted to make contact!

I'm currently on board the 'intended kidnapping, accidental murder' theory boat, but the bit I quoted above has me wondering about the possibility of the husband's involvement afterall. Like, the case hits the public and suddenly the kidnappers make contact. Almost like the husband thought ""crap, fingers are gonna be pointing my way, my reputation is at stake, better remind everyone that they need to focused on the"" kidnappers"" who haven't been heard from since the day my wife went missing."" I dunno. It's an odd one. It does sound like Tom is the prime suspect now, judging by the lake search and the dropped focus on the men in the surveillance footage."

raisedbynarcissists,f5cgtkt,t3_dnd8n3,1572134844.0,"Thanks for sharing. My older sister was the golden child, I the scapegoat, and it's only been the last few years (we are in our thirties) that we've both been opening up to each other about our experiences. I realise now that she too was a victim, just in a different way.

What's interesting in our case is that recently she's said to me that she's become the scapegoat. I'm LC with our mother, while my sister sees her frequently (my sister is a workaholic so relies on our mother to help with her kids) and she has been telling me about certain things our mother has said and done that are all too familiar to me. I truly believe that me being away and not contactable means that my mother is directing her self hatred at my sister now. I feel terrible for my sister and am supporting her as best I can, but I also feel validated in that yes my experience did happen."
