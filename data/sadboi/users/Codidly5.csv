baseball,fobesst,t1_fobam2m,1587659063.0,"Maybe, as someone else in this thread pointed out, Grisham walked and scored a run in the first inning, Yelich wouldn’t have been hitting lead-off. 

It’s easy to point to injuries as to why a team did or didn’t win, but looking at what was controllable on the field at the time of the game is what matters in my opinion. Like, of course Yelich is much better both offensively and defensively than Grisham, but if you play the game of “if Yelich wasn’t hurt they win” then an equally likely outcome is that Yelich could have played and struck-out every at bat. In that case, even if he makes the play in RF that Grisham flubbed, that original Grisham first-inning run is off the board, and two runs would’ve given the Nats the lead anyway.

All of that is pure conjecture, of course. I just prefer to think about the relatively controllable elements within the game, rather than point to injuries as a reason that a team lost, especially in what was such a close game; it almost cheapens it, in a way."
