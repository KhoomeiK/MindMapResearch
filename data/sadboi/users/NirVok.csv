I read a lot and so in turn I tend to come up with all sorts of story ideas of my own and I'll make a note of them and for any that I feel like I can actually expand on I'll do more with it. Normally I'll come up with a rough general plot  of how I'm thinking of where I want the story to go, mostly as a guide for my own sake, and then I'll come up with characters and some backgrounds and descriptions of them. Along with any other thing I can think of that might play an interesting part in the story like governments or corporations, even just locations. I seem to have a knack for naming things. 
I'll get up to the point of maybe making a bit of an outline for it but rarely get past the first chapter. I'll get it written down then go back through it to see how it reads and I tend to scrap most of it because it feels too drawn out and winded, I feel like I keep over detailing things because I can picture it in my head and try to put it all down on paper, but when I take like two or three pages describing a room I just feel like it's a bit much. The problem is I do it like all the time.

I'm still struggling with it tbh cuz now I just feel alone and neglected. It doesn't help that I'm fairly anti social and don't really go out much or put myself in an environment to meet new people, I've always been on the really shy side, so when the people I care about don't even bother to check up on me I just feel like a part of myself has been stomped on and why should I even try anymore. Sorry I just kinda took the opportunity to vent a little here but I guess in a way I can say that your not alone in feeling the way you do, there's more of us out here going through something similar.
