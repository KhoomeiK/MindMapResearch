THEY. There has to be 2 parties unable to control their lust. So far, it’s just you and your only reason for wanting to get married is so that you can have sex. You could literally be marrying a serial killer, but that’s okay with you because at least you got to have sex, right?

Also, yes there are situations where you should get married right away in order to avoid premarital sex

There are people who planned their weddings in April and May and have had to cancel them due to what’s going on in the world. Those people are going to the courthouse to get legally married and having the ceremony later so that they can have sex. That’s a situation in which you speed up the process.

At the very least, a separation needs to happen. There needs to be ground rules such as both of you going to individual therapy and possibly even marriage counseling. A time limit needs to be set. I’d say anywhere from 6 months to a year.

You’ve mentioned nothing about church. Do you two go to church? Are there any elders who can guide you through an appropriate separation?

Even though everything you’ve said in terms of what you two have both done to each other is awful, I do want you to know that there is a possibility for restoration. It will be a lot of work and it will suck, but it is possible.

I’ll say something like, “I listened to this today and it really made me think! I’d love to hear your thoughts on it.” Then that evening, we are able to talk about it. It gets him in the word and allows us to connect as well.

He does the same with me but will send me an article or a specific verse he’s focusing on for the week and we talk about it.

The number one issue, if you are Christian and I assume you guys are since you’re posting in a Christian sub, is that your husband shouldn’t be lusting after other women. Only you.

2. Look up articles on betrayal trauma for the time being - since you aren’t able to see your therapist right now. Some articles have great tips for dealing with flashbacks, triggers, emotions, etc. 

3. Stay as busy as you can. Idle hands are the devil’s playground. In a case like that, when you have idle time, your thoughts will ruminate on what has happened. Find a hobby or get back into a hobby that you used to love before all of this. Find a new show on Netflix or Hulu (that is clean and happy), so that it can take up time in your mind. 

4. Journal. Allow yourself one hour every day to get your thoughts down. That can be your one hour to be upset, cry, be angry, etc. Then, put the journal away and move on to something positive and something that will bring you joy. 

5. I said this already, but stop communicating with your ex! Stop.

You need to completely grieve the loss of your son. That HAS to happen before any sort of healing or forgiving can take place. You said you immediately jumped back into work and back into normalcy. 

Take a step back. If you don’t allow yourself to properly grieve, it will continue to fester. 

I’m not saying what your husband did was right. He went behind your back and did something horrible. But if he has genuinely apologized and repented for his actions, you two will never get anywhere until you forgive him. Forgiveness doesn’t mean that you’re okay with it. You will never be okay with it. But it no longer gives power to this thing that the devil so clearly wants to use as a force to separate you two. 

Restoration is possible. These aren’t issues that are grounds for any sort of divorce in the Bible. 

Keep fighting. The devil wants you to give up and he wants to win. Don’t let him.

I won’t fault you for either. She took it way too extreme by giving you enhancement drugs. That could have been a deadly situation. 

I went back and read your first post. She’s obviously in very deep, and it seems as though she is not willing to try and work on this. 

If that is the case, there’s nothing you can do and it would be best to leave. If an addict doesn’t want to get clean, there is no point in trying to reason with them. 

If she begins to show any sort of remorse and she wants to try and work this out, then you have to decide if it is worth it. This is not an easy process and she will most likely relapse...but restoration is possible. It just takes a lot of work.

I felt pretty bad and there was a line starting up behind me. Another register opened near me and several of the people went over to that one. The lady directly behind me decided to stay as we had struck up a small conversation about random things. She didn’t have much in her hands, so I decided to just add her stuff to my ticket so she could go along with her day. It was less than ~$10 worth of stuff, but she was very sweet and appreciative! It for sure felt good. 

Thank you for the opportunity. 💜"

Even now, after years of this and my husband being sober for over a year, I STILL get anxious looking through his phone. But it has to be done. We have a 24/7 “stop, drop, give me your phone” rule. It may be extreme to some - but it was necessary for us. He knows at any point and time, I can look through his phone and he won’t have a chance to delete or hide anything. I don’t even do it very often because we have parameters set on his phone, but I totally understand your anxiety. But...it has to happen. He has to know and understand that whatever he is doing needs to be stopped NOW. 

His word is not good enough right now. He broke your trust and he has to EARN that trust back. Honestly, he does not have ANY right to privacy right now because of what he has done. 

I know it seems extreme. I know you don’t want to do it and he is definitely not going to like it, but boundaries need to be set. And he needs to be kept accountable for his actions. 

I’m here if you need to DM me any time. 💜"
loveafterporn,ffv2cqc,t3_evck2f,1580254075.0,He’s your husband and there needs to be some sort of accountability. How serious is he taking his recovery? Does he have an accountability partner that can go through his phone and check?

As far as the breakdown, it seems pretty equal."

Seek out and get connected to a group as soon as possible so that you can both get more support. Do not stop pursuing God or your wife or your marriage.

The devil wants to win this round. Don’t let him."
Christianmarriage,ffoz9nq,t3_eubvbl,1580083589.0,"Have you told her what you’re telling us? I know that seems like an obvious question, but is there open communication there and if so, how has she responded?"
DelphiMurders,ffoughb,t1_ffnv4gb,1580081974.0,Ah yes - I love when people disagree with me by only correcting my grammar and not giving an actual argument.
