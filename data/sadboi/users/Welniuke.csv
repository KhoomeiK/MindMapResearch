""wow they're really uneven"" ""they're kinda saggy, I wish they were perkier"" and much more) so I totally understand You. A lot of men are cunts when it comes to hook ups, they just want a quick cum and the girl or how she looks doesn't matter to them as long as they feel satisfied. These type of guys also have 0 regards for our feelings.

Kissing + trying to masturbate is the worst 'cause I'm doing everything for him and have to somehow remember how to kiss, how to masturbate and pretend I'm feeling at least something when all I'd like to do is to completely get lost in my thoughts and just relax not thinking about what I have to do or how.

TheMonkeysPaw,evsfdo4,t3_baehee,1564744243.0,"I see a flaw with Your edited argument. The idea that people would stop working because they have money makes no sense. People would actually actively seek out to create things because they'd have the time and resources to do so.  There are million of people in this world who are creating things as hobbies are doing it for free or would continue to do it for free if they stopped getting paid for it (just obviously would do it less frequently) and then there are those of us who need to first provide for ourselves and thus as much as we'd like to explore a certain craft or service we simply can't because we prioritise our well being which directly correlates to having money so we could survive in this world. 

Yes, there might be a few people who wouldn't do shit... But they're also doing the exact same thing right now by living off of benefits provided by the government because people pay taxes and support those who can't work and those who simply exploit the system. Yet they are the minority (if they were a majority our society would have fallen apart a long time ago already). 

Everyone I know has something they would love to do but the only thing really stopping them is either money or an education (which in certain cases also requires money and then connections, because the field isn't funded well so opportunities to work in the field are limited which also leads to the lack of money). I so far don't know any person who doesn't have some sort of passion, even if they aren't actively pursuing it.

socialskills,evp6ntk,t1_evp1odg,1564667289.0,"Same :( 
I guess it's because of the whole introvert / extrovert thing. 

The people who keep talking about doing all that fun stuff and seem to have photos on their social media with outings with friends (I mean like big groups of friends and their friends friends and etc) seem to be extroverted. Generally, they seem to not find what to do at home, alone and they seem to have high social skills which makes meeting new people and connections easier for them. 

Meanwhile, I and probably many other people on this thread with similar experiences, are probably introverted in a sense that they do enjoy spending time alone or with close friends. But that we generally enjoy spending our time alone by reading books, playing video games, watching films or even going outside or to events alone. However, while this might make us knowledgeable in certain topics, it doesn't make for fun stories to tell about all the ""crazy"" stuff we did. 

Doesn't make us any worse (or better) though 🤷‍♀

We all have fetishes, it's just disgusting to fetishise a race. Especially since this girl doesn't actually like Asian men. A lot of Asians tend to be dark skinned and overall look nothing like her pale skinned idols, who are all supposedly very tall and very skinny, a lot of whom have also undergone plastic surgery (nothing against that) because the industry simply demands it.

Anyone who backs her up also seems to completely miss the point. 

Honestly, I've been there and I've known crazy K-pop stans like that (who forget their idols are also human) and You should keep Your distance from her until she matures enough (if she does). Seriously, most people who aren't into K-pop underestimate just how crazy the fans get. It can ruin friendships and not just because of the hobby itself, but because for the crazy stans it changes how they interact with others. Again this doesn't apply to everyone, some just really enjoy the music, but some end up being koreaboos (""anyeong, how are you, oppa?"" yes people try to speak like that and I wish I could say that this is the minority, but not from my experience)"

That just sounds unprofessional no matter how You look at it. The artist should have at least informed You that they don't want to / can't work with You if that's the case. Completely ghosting a potential client is bad for any business and he's making the whole studio look bad.

I mean it's possible the artist is the type of person who doesn't like to talk about designs for free because well their advice also costs time and maybe they've been fucked over by someone in the past who got tips from this artist but had stuff done (or were an artist themselves?) somewhere else. Valid too. But then they should just drop a message saying they don't do this and here's their price for advice. That's also valid.

Yes, sometimes things like this will happen; when telling a story or exchanging information You might end up having to mention Your EX partner or their relatives, or friends. It's normal.

I understand why You're upset, I get it. This does sound stressful when You know that You can't spend money however You want, because You have a budget. However, shouldn't things like these be thought of BEFORE going on a trip? 

It was obvious You were going to have to eat so on top of the boat costs it was obvious there were going to be additional expenses on food. It does feel best to actually let Yourself splurge a bit when in a new country to actually have a taste of their cuisine instead of eating something You could also make at home.

Used to love it as a kid and I got really creative with my excuses as to why I couldn't go outside to play, but then high school came where I didn't make any friends, but saw everyone get into these social groups + social media and smartphones peaked then so I couldn't even escape everyone else's ""great lives""when I was at home. 

&#x200B;

Went to uni and I did everything to seem like that ""cool kid""I aspired to be in high school. Didn't work, but I got good social skills and went out of my comfort zone, made one great close friend, and a few other friends I cherish. None from the modules I took in uni (some of the new found friends aren't even from uni). I was and am alone there, always. Kinda awkward.

&#x200B;

Why it didn't work? Because although I was doing everything I thought I was supposed to be, turns out it's not what I enjoy and I was just feeling a deep FOMO.  Plus, I actually wasn't very good at it and am still considered a weirdo.

&#x200B;

On the bright side I've come to the realisation that the thing I value the most is being myself, which makes me weird to a lot of other people. Well that and I love solitude. It's still hard to see everyone having a bunch of friends and doing the things I think I should be doing (going out, socialising, going on trips and whatnot) but honestly those things are often very draining for me and I can't do it to the extent people tend to do it. FOMO is still a bitch ofc (gosh I really can't concentrate with background music playing because I'm losing my train of thought, haha). Basically what I'm trying to say is that if You enjoy being by Yourself or are *introverted* as they say (and You most likely do / are, because I've noticed that the social people we see are usually the people that can barely spend a second alone and will meet and talk with any stranger because it's fun for them) then learn to remind Yourself that it's okay and You're only feeling FOMO, however, it's not something that You'd actually be happy with. 

&#x200B;

Close friendships are hard to make and it's okay. Cherish anyone You're close with (even if it's a family member or an online friend) and don't let societies norms and expectations dictate how You live Your life. Easier said than done, but just try.

Otherwise, You're fine. You simply have a quite attainable dream, that's no need for a therapist to get involved (again, just judging by the post, other factors can change this). 

&#x200B;

Nor does it sound like You hate Your job. Not everyone find self realisation through work and that's okay too. People like us will always feel ""eh"" about work and wish we could enjoy life itself. 

&#x200B;

I might suggest looking for a hobby, a passion instead of making a life change. That way You might feel like You're getting the most out of life without having to sacrifice Your stability and relationships for it. Maybe. It's definitely worth a try before making a drastic impulsive change."

Your sister is an absolute asshole for not being able to admit her wrong and what she did AND blaming You for what happened all those years back. The ""making up false homophobia accusations"" part is her basically saying that everything that happened to You when You were 16 is somehow not because You were gay and that it should be alright to have treated You this way. She's putting the blame on You for literally everything that happened.

People also find feet sexy yet people are still allowed to wear sandals and open toed shoes. This argument makes 0 sense. We'd all have to be wearing a sheet over our entire body if we didn't want to show anything sexual. Again men's torsos are also sexual (the nipples, the pecks or manboobs, the arms, the bellies) yet somehow these are allowed. Again. Argument makes 0 sense. 

Also some people find kids to be sexual so now do we lock up all the kids because of some sick fucks? Yeah no, we don't."
TooAfraidToAsk,eufsd1n,t1_eufs561,1563789007.0,"Depends on who looks at them.

Now You might say they're not and to some they're not, but to me and a lot of people I know they are. I also know a lot of people who don't find breasts sexual at all. So no. They're not sexual at all. No body part is sexual unless You specifically have an attraction for it. Otherwise they're just body parts and should be normalised. 

I mean let's remember the story of how women's feet or ankles could be shown because they were sexual and inappropriate. Ain't the case now, is it? Same with breasts. If You try to change it, it will change eventually."

By having a picture of me with a cleavage on IG I can immediately know who to talk to on tinder and who not. The majority of guys will immediately me like ""tits 😍"" > they get unmatched.

TooAfraidToAsk,eufn2h5,t3_cg80zt,1563781590.0,"Because men are allowed to post butt naked pictures of them, but women will often get reported. It's considered too sexual for a woman to show her ass, but not for a man. Women's breasts are still ""inappropriate"". For me these pictures are just a way to feel good. Like I feel so good in how I look I want to share it with others (like how sometimes we see such a beautiful subset and we want to upload it for everyone to see). I just want my body and me feeling good in it to be accepted. On top of this, when I was a teen I was extremely self conscious. Sure I knew what a real woman looks like because I lived with women, but otherwise I'd only see porn and men's reactions on these perfect women. I thought I was born a freak for not looking like them when I hit puberty. But now I'm seeing so much body positivity of women of all shapes and sizes, all sorts of breasts and labia confidently sharing their pictures and it makes me feel good about myself. Seeing the confidence and knowing that it's okay. 

Idk it's really tough to explain the thought process. But mostly it's about normalising what is normal, but society deems it abnormal."

MentalHealthSupport,eued589,t3_cg3gs1,1563741395.0,"The cause can only really be determined by a professional. I do this and my psychiatrist thinks I have OCD, then again this isn't my only issue. 

Personally I just try positive self talk. It started from an exercise that the psychiatrist suggested I do and I made it my own. It's hard at first, but try to learn to catch Yourself thinking like that and then stop and think the opposite. It really helps me when I write it down and actually have a conversation with myself. I never write the negative things I'm thinking, I just write the reply, something I'd say to a friend who would be panicking in that same situation. It helps me look at the situation objectively and calms me down a lot.

If my explanation is hard to understand (and it probably is) here's an example: let's say You're terrified of an upcoming job interview. You take a pen and paper and pretend it's Your friend who is telling You all those things that are in Your head.
Let's say this is going through Your head: ""What if I will walk into the building and I walk into one of their glass walls and the HR person sees this, laughs me out and makes every person in the office laugh at me and then they just tell me to leave because I just made a fool of myself and they don't want to hire a failure like that?!!"" 
So You write something like: ""okay, logically thinking what is the possibility of this happening? In it's entirety - none. And even if it magically does happen would You even want to work in a company with such a toxic environment? You're worth much more than that and a simple human mistake (happens to everyone at least once) isn't something to publicly shame You for. This isn't high school. You're a confident person, I believe in You, You'll do great"". 

Not a great example, but I personally expand a lot and write things that I might not personally believe in (I have self esteem issue, but I will still write ""I'm beautiful"" even if I feel like I look like rotten garbage) to boost my positive self talk. It's worked really well for me and occasionally really turned things around for me after I've been in the dumps. When I used to do it more often (I'd just sit an write for like 30min non stop in the evening) I eventually started talking to myself in a similar manner whenever a situation arose where I didn't have time to write it all out. It made me stop the never ending circle of worst case scenario and try to focus on something realistic and hyping myself up to not feel anxious. 

Idk, it's not much but that's what I can offer from personal experience. Maybe it will help. I hope it does if You ever try it."

Cutting is a very u healthy coping mechanism and I wish I had some advice on how to stop it.. I've seen a post where supposedly a girl was advised by her therapist to draw with a non sharp object (like a non toxic marker) on all the places that she would want to cut, supposedly. I can't verify if it's true and if it really has helped anyone, but that's honestly the only suggestion I can offer, I'm sorry. 
I really hope You seek out professional help. Mental health is as important as physical health. You're not feeling well so don't be afraid to ask for professional help. Don't diminish Your suffering just because someone else, somewhere is feeling worse. There will always be someone worse off, but this will never invalidate Your own feelings and experiences. 

One of the things that helped me was that I had a goal ""to be happy"". It's silly, it's stupid, I know. But I ended up googling a lot on this ""how to be happy"" thing. I'm not a professional, I don't know if any of it actually helps or is just a placebo. But I did anything I could find that required the least amount of effort. Even if I didn't believe in it (for example: positive self talk). It won't erase the problem, but might help even if just slightly, to cope with it.


Thank You for Your concern, it's really sweet of You and I am better now. Far from perfect or what I'd consider ""good"" (I slip up much too often). Hope this serves as a reminder to You that thins DO get better.

I'm sorry I can't offer substantial advice to make You feel better. But I can talk from personal experience having been in a similar situation as You. 

I've always been an introvert and an indoors person, I loved spending time on the computer. Then high school came around which meant I had to change schools + social media and technology got much bigger with everyone suddenly having smartphones. I saw everyone being out going, I heard people talking about their parties and what not and I felt like I was missing out on life. I got into an extremely bad place, that's when I started cutting. I felt like a freak, like I'm wasting my time. I also started going to my schools therapist. What I learnt from her and the years after high school (the time when I keep remembering her advice but only now do I believe it having experienced it for myself) is that You don't have to be outgoing. You do not. You don't need to be like everyone else and force Yourself to go out when You can't or don't want to, when You're not feeling up for it. It's okay. It is. You're not wasting a single second by being different. You're not wasting a single second by not going out. And don't think that these are the only ""good years"" you have left. You'll be able to go outside even when You're older and You'll enjoy it much more. I know You feel pressured to be ""like everyone else"" because that's what puberty and high school does to us, but You don't have to be. Youth is overrated, life doesn't end when Your first wrinkle or gray hair shows. It's okay to feel unwell and like You don't want to go out. You don't have to force Yourself to do it and You shouldn't beat Yourself up for it."
