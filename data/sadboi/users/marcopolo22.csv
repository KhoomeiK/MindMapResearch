I agree with this — it’s impossible to progress throughout the game without killing dozens of folks who don’t deserve it (RIP half of Strawberry), so I don’t think it’s necessary to play evil towards the front. The nuances bad-to good transformation comes naturally as you play out the story.

The point where Arthur finds out he’s sick is (IIRC) the first time his honor determines the images he sees. If he’s bad, it could be the story of turning things around. If he’s good, it’s the story of a man discovering the goodness that was in him the whole time."
Catholicism,fqcskbv,t3_ghxlad,1589267530.0,"I was near-suicidal back in November/December. Passive suicidal thoughts... I didn’t make any explicit plans, but I couldn’t stop daydreaming about doing it. I was hating myself and constantly sad and wanted to fall asleep for a very long time. Mixture of genetic depression, SAD, and unfortunate life events (unemployment + romantic heartbreak).

I say this all to give you context on the degree to which I can (or cannot) empathize with your condition. I am so so sorry that you are suffering from that. I just said a prayer for you.

As far as advice, I found it helpful to think about the things I’d be missing out on if I left the world, big and small... everything from being best man at my brother’s wedding to the new season of Brooklyn Nine Nine. It reminds me of a good quote about these situations, “You don’t need to be happy about the future, you just need to be interested.”  

In the end, a combination of medication and therapy helped right the ship. I can share more about my particular experience with medication, if you’d like.

We all love you. No matter what. Not only do we love you, but we appreciate you. You’re great.

Try saying this: “I’m not ok right now, and that’s ok.”  It sounds weird, but it allowed me to feel sad without being upset at myself for being a pessimistic downer.

Also, call your friends. Tell them what you’re thinking. Most, of not all, serious depressive thoughts are plainly irrational (nobody likes me, I’m a failure, etc). When you say it out loud to another person, it forces you to realize the silliness of those statements. Talking to your friends can be like a splash of perspective.

I know you didn’t ask for non-prayer advice but it’s 2 am and I just finished red dead redemption 2 (but not the epilogues, no spoilers!!) and I’m typing away with love and prayers."

I define loving someone as wanting for them to be in a state of grace, meaning they would have to show genuine contrition to both God and their fellow humans for the mortally wrong things they’ve done. If Adolf Hitler were alive today, I’d hope he would realize the wrong he’s done, experience genuine sorrow and regret for his horrific actions, and make the appropriate reparations (i.e. surrendering himself to the authorities). I wouldn’t wish for him to keep believing horrible, hateful things. I wouldn’t wish for him to stay evil. 

That’s love: the basic hope for people to be good and leave sin behind them.

washu,fnvw4sq,t3_g42x5t,1587306165.0,"Background: I graduated in 2017 from the college of arts and sciences, studying economics 

Academically: Very strong across the board. The biggest groups are probably pre-meds, computer and biomedical engineering, and business students, but there’s a wide array of majors after that. I don’t think it’s possible to pick a major which isn’t robust, challenging (in a good way) and respected.

Socially: genuinely kind and helpful culture. I never had a single experience of another student being academically competitive and “cut-throat,” which you do hear about at other schools. We’d help each other cram and study. Super supportive.

In my experience, almost everyone I came across was good-hearted. I think there’s something about attending a school with less name recognition than a UChicago or Cornell that draws more humble, head-on-straight kind of kids.

Even though the sports teams perform well, there was little to no sports culture when I left. I think I’ve heard that football is getting people now, which is great, but it still doesn’t compare to D1 schools. So students rely on other things for community & fun — cultural shows, clubs, IM sports, Greek life, etc. 

The main concern of social makeup is that WashU is still playing catch-up in terms of economic diversity... they redirected money towards school development in order to become the top school that they are now, but that meant scholarships to low-income students took a back seat. They’ve only recently started to reset that balance, now that we’ve established ourselves as a top school. I don’t think it’s a reason to not attend the school, but it’s a bit awkward, and something to keep in mind if you ARE low-income.

Regarding humanities: WashU has a great literary history and excellent humanities faculty. Again, it’s one of those things we’re they’re strong across the board, so you can’t really go wrong. I took a lot of history/poli sci courses and thoroughly enjoyed them. Writing/English department is great as well. Philosophy dept had some of my fave classes I’ve ever taken. Rest assured, if you study the humanities in art sci, you’ll have a wide array of great courses and profs and subjects to pick from. I can’t really say how it would compare to other schools, except that I was pleased with it as a social sciences major who spent a lot of time in humanities classes :)

CatholicMemes,flk5fzk,t1_fljzxa4,1585234305.0,"> So if you have confession and you confess and are perfectly contrite you will be forgiven, will you still be forgiven even if your motivation to go to confession was fear of hell and death? I understand that as imperfect contrition.

Fear of hell and death is a rational, emotional part of contrition, but it shouldn’t be the main thing. I think the best way to explain this is to share a popular American prayer of contrition (at the end of confession, one has to make an “act of contrition” to be absolved. I typically just freestyle one using the basic format of this version):

O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee,

and I detest all my sins because I dread the loss of Heaven and the pains of hell,

But most of all because they have offended Thee, 

my God, Who art all good and deserving of all my love.

I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace,
to confess my sins,

to do penance,

and to amend my life. Amen

> Thanks for all the other information, is the penance that they give you used to forgive the temporal or eternal punishment for the sin?

You’re very welcome! So there isn’t really a distinction between temporal and eternal punishment, as all mortal (i.e. serious) sin results in the same thing: separation from God. We Catholics describe this is being out of a “state of grace,” and confession is what brings us back into that state of grace. We believe that if one dies while NOT in a state of grace, then they spend their eternity away from God in hell.

So regarding the temporal/eternal thing... mortal sinning and repenting is what brings us in and out of the state of grace, and whatever state you’re in when you die is pretty much the choice you’re making for eternity. 

HOWEVER, there are a ton of qualifiers to this last statement, such as:
* Sin is only mortal if the perpetrator has free will, knowledge of the wrongness, and does something deeply wrong.
* If you are contrite and get hit by a bus while walking to confess a mortal sin, you’re good... it’s the thought that counts.
* It is possible to achieve a state of grace through an “act of perfect contrition,” where one truly is fully sorry —not for the fear of hell or want for heaven, but because they deeply regret hurting God’s feelings by disrespecting Him. (Sounds very Protestant, right?)  Basically, one has to be of P U R E heart to achieve this outside of confession. This isn’t something to depend on, though, because we humans are dumb and often misdiagnose our moral standing, so the sacrament of reconciliation (confession) is still the go-to. 

To give an example of the act of perfect contrition thing: I once waited in line 35 minutes for confession and didn’t get heard. I had felt bad all week, and so badly wanted to be back on the same page with God that I cried. Afterwards, I realized, “Hey, if I was so sad to not be in union with God that I cried... I think he heard me.”  I still went to confession the next week, but it was comforting to be back in a good place in my relationship with God.

Anyway, I gotta get some breakfast, but please feel free to ask any other questions you have!"

CatholicMemes,fljv8n3,t1_fliokhp,1585227496.0,"No it’s a good question! Honestly the explanation you were given does make it sound that way, and unfortunately it seems that a decent number of Catholics treat confession with a presumption of mercy (which, as mentioned elsewhere, means they weren’t truly contrite, and is a sin in itself).

But typically, the priest might ask context questions about the sins to get a better understanding of where you’re coming from, especially if they want to prescribe you a more personalized penance. If there is plenty of time and no line, it’s common to have a conversation with the priest, asking him follow-up questions and talking things out. It can basically become spiritually counseling. It’s awesome. 

And anyone can go to confession, for the record! You just won’t get formally absolved at the end if you aren’t confirmed Catholic, but you’ll instead get blessed, and that’s always nice. I speak from experience as a Protestant->Catholic convert :)"

Coronavirus,fkts29z,t1_fkt7qqa,1584532754.0,"See I had the opposite — fever and aches, but no respiratory issues. My best guess is a seasonal flu, but there’s no way to know for sure."
thebachelor,fkt15cr,t1_fks9m41,1584503392.0,"I actually read up on this recently, some seemingly legit studies found that, given normal wear and tear, jeans only really need to be washed 2 or 3 times a year. They have as much bacteria at 1 week as they do at 5 months."
StLouis,fkrxjz1,t1_fkr0ah9,1584478033.0,"I worked there for 2 years as an IT consultant, and I 100% agree: there is 0 tangible need to be in the office, and that’s the case for most desk jobs there. I get the preference for working together, but their rigid rules were unreasonable and counter-productive.

Unfortunately, management is unnecessarily demanding of workers to have good “optics,” often for no good reason. One of the Charter bosses would be upset if a consultant worked from home one day, despite the fact that these consultants typically never interacted with charter employees or did so in a way that couldn’t be easily accomplished over chat. 

And that was when there WASN’T A FUCKING PANDEMIC

This article doesn’t surprise me, but still infuriated me."

What kind of stuff have you knitted?"
toastme,fkpi8ko,t3_fj97lf,1584410773.0,"I’m so sorry, man, that sucks. So much. You’re going to find your true match some day, I know it — you’re too handsome not to!

In all seriousness, I wish you every bit of luck and strength and courage. You’re great."
toastme,fkpi2yt,t3_fj9xm8,1584410668.0,"You are an AWESOME person. How do I know? Because you’re that freakin great.

Keep making us proud and being the most *you* version of you, because the world is so much better for it :)"
toastme,fkphuh2,t3_fjh85h,1584410510.0,"You’re an awesome looking guy who I would happily chat up! Keep your head up, and try to remember that life will bring all sorts of new people in your circle. It sounds like the current circle of people doesn’t have many matches, but over time, you’ll find those people, and they’ll hold on to you :)"
toastme,fkpholw,t3_fjhqbh,1584410403.0,You 100% did the right thing. Your selflessness and prudence and strength is so needed in times like these. Thank you.
toastme,fkphive,t3_fjue7f,1584410299.0,"I’ve dealt with depression too. You’re not alone. I’m thankful you posted. You’re a great person, and I’m excited to see what your future holds for the world — no matter how many ups and downs it has. Stay strong, and try to keep your head up, king — but don’t beat yourself up if you need to rest it down for a bit."
toastme,fkphac6,t3_fjv8pw,1584410141.0,"You are brave and wise to look elsewhere to discuss this. Thank you for coming here.

“Be a man” is such a shit fallacy which is a major cause of depression. FUCK THAT NOISE. I still deal with that at 25. You are all the better for already realizing that, and I promise it’ll only get easier to ignore that crap and make life decisions with confidence and moral guidance, as opposed to shit people."
