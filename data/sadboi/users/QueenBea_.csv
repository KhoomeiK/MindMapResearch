But as far as annoying freebies; I have a yarn subscription box that I receive every month, and I ordered two in December. Both boxes came with these little, mini beanie hats with a mini pompom on top. They‚Äôre adorable, but I have no use for them and I feel bad throwing them out, especially since the yarn is definitely acrylic (aka plastic).

I do like useful freebies though. In that same box they sometimes send free buttons, crochet hooks, pins, stuff that is generally used by everyone in the craft. That kind of stuff I like! As long as a freebie is directly related to the item you‚Äôre selling I think freebies would be nice. But sending stickers to people who buy embroidery might not be useful to everyone"

My only comments are as follows:

- pictures. I‚Äôd recommend taking pics on a white or stark background in strong natural lighting. This will make the yarn pop out more, and it better displays the colors IRL.
- take pics of what the yarn looks like once it‚Äôs knit/crocheted. I usually won‚Äôt buy yarn unless I can see what it looks like once it‚Äôs worked up. It doesn‚Äôt need to be anything fancy; even a quick machine knit using those kids toys! Something that‚Äôll show the customer a more clear idea of what they‚Äôre buying 
- list exactly what percentages of each material the yarn is made out of.
- list care instructions in the ‚Äúabout‚Äù section of each yarn

The other images posted in this thread are real and are easily fact checked online. At 12 weeks a fetus is barely developed and definitely does NOT look like a miniature infant. It‚Äôs worth noting that the first image I shared was from a pro life website where a mother shows her 12 week old fetus after a miscarriage. The second source is a pro choice site sharing what a 12 week old fetus looks like because of the insane amount of misinformation trying to make fetuses look like miniature babies, when in reality they look like bloody clumps of organ pieces and skin. It isn‚Äôt until around the second half of the second trimester and third trimester when the fetus is distinguishable as a baby.

ChoosingBeggars,fi4j72m,t1_fi4g21o,1582142255.0,"A nurse in uniform is likely either on their way into work, which all first responders do before being on duty, or are on one of their rare breaks. If a cop or EMS is on break then they also aren‚Äôt going to have to run off on a seconds notice because they‚Äôre on break; they actually have state/government required breaks which they‚Äôre actually capable of taking. Nurses frequently are required to go without any breaks.

Your inability to have a discussion about this without resulting to name calling is more telling of your attitude and personality than mine. Unlike you, I‚Äôm capable of discussing a topic that I‚Äôm not emotionally invested in, and that certainly doesn‚Äôt effect me whatsoever since I‚Äôm not a nurse. Your rigid and seeming unsympathetic line of thinking is very concerning considering you‚Äôre a teacher, and to me it sounds like you‚Äôre mad that nurses provide a more crucial service role that actually are life and death and are therefore more deserving of discounts similar to first responders than teachers are; especially when your only argument is about how much money you‚Äôre spending. This conversation isn‚Äôt about which job spends more money. It‚Äôs about how people who sacrifice massive amounts of personal and family time, mental well being, and who risk physical injury daily in order to provide life saving services should all receive a nice perk here or there for working a thankless job."
ChoosingBeggars,fi4fdsh,t1_fi4eav7,1582140075.0,"If EMS is given special discounts or accolades then I think this should also apply to any medical professionals who are risking their lives, emotional and physical stability to better society just as they do.

If someone is risking their lives to provide life saving services to society they should also be considered on the level of EMS, police and firefighters as they‚Äôre providing the same service. I also find it funny that you‚Äôre resorting to personal insults because you aren‚Äôt able to respond to my questions to you about why EMS apparently deserve something as stupid as coffee discounts but apparently nurses don‚Äôt; while they have more job duties and higher education than EMS."
ChoosingBeggars,fi4dso3,t1_fi4cg8a,1582139157.0,"I‚Äôm curious to know why you think EMS is entitled to a discount but not nurses? You also ignored a large chunk of what I said. Nurses are also frequently away from their family. Most work nights and are left to sleep all day. They‚Äôre expected to pick up crazy overtime, usually working 60-80+ hours a week. EMS is with the patient for the trip, but nurses are the ones caring for them every day in enclosed spaces with them for long periods of time, having to clean up after them and handle bodily fluids of sick people. They come into prolonged contact with MRSA, C. diff, flu, pnemonia, and other highly infectious illnesses every day. They are left to restrain belligerent/high/confused patients three times their size alone, and are frequently punched, spit on, kicked and slapped with no legal recourse and an inability to switch the patient to someone else.

I fail to see why they shouldn‚Äôt be considered on the same level as EMS. The shifts are the same if not worse, the workload is the same if not worse, and while EMS are usually slammed with work, they still only have one patient at a time. Nurses are HEAVILY understaffed and generally have 10+ patients just for themselves (California average with their mandated rations is 4 per nurse). NY can go over 15 patients per nurse, for 20 hour shifts.

Nurses actually have a higher suicide rate than military because of the stress and mistreatment for their profession. Not to mention most nurses are horribly underpaid, receive little to no benefits, while cops are granted awesome pay, benefits, and pensions. Nurses also are frequently given no breaks while working at a minimum 12 hour shifts, and barely have time to even pee."

Not to mention the abuse (both physical and emotional) that they deal with on a daily basis. They stand between life and death daily, and one wrong move can lead to someone dying. I‚Äôm not sure why nurses aren‚Äôt included with cops, firefighters and EMS. Nurses do a lot more than people think. They aren‚Äôt wiping butts and moving the elderly around; that‚Äôs CNAs and LPNs.

cats,ffki63t,t1_ffk30sy,1580023164.0,"It can be a very long process! My best advice is to try to learn her body language so you can figure out when she feels comfortable with you approaching and when she doesn‚Äôt. The next stop would be trying to socialize her. Feed her treats one at a time, and take one step closer to her with each treat. Stop as soon as she shows any sign of fear. Do this until she‚Äôll eventually eat them out of your hands. From there you can try to pet her while she eats treats. 

Here is more awesome advice!

I also HIGHLY suggest looking up Jackson Galaxy! He can socialize even the scariest, most aggressive cats. He is amazing. A lot of the times a cats fear can be cured by introducing more play, but most importantly figuring out the root issue (such as other pets, children, etc)

Don‚Äôt give up yet! There is definitely hope!"

cats,ffkgypr,t1_ffk835y,1580022594.0,"At first she was absolutely in shock. She stayed under my bed for a week straight, calling out every once in a while. We had her in my bedroom with her food and litter so she could slowly acclimate to the house (and so she could have a safe space to retreat to) and Dax my male cat would constantly try to get into the room. At first I thought he might attack the Gis, but when we let him in to try to let him get used to her scent they clicked after a very small round of mutual hissing. She followed him around like a little chick! Thankfully she wasn‚Äôt afraid of him like she was with humans. Funny enough, she reacts to other cats with intense aggression now. Kittens she can handle. There was just something special about Dax, and he taught her how to be a cat as if he was her mother!

Now that Dax is 8 and lazy and fat while the Gis is still young and playful he gets annoyed with her constant energy, but they still play together nightly and I catch them cuddling and grooming each other at least once a week"
cats,ffkg37n,t1_ffjpmuq,1580022189.0,That happens so often! It‚Äôs awful! Facebook is such a sketchy place to find pets. It‚Äôs wonderful to be able to take these animals from bad homes/irresponsible people (or uninformed people) so thank you for taking the kitten in!

Before him I had taken in 3 kittens from my backyard who were abandoned. We had a massive feral cat colony who seemed to use our yard as a breeding ground! We rehomed those little guys once they were older and socialized. I have a soft spot for the cats who need some help!"

He was a very happy, outgoing, playful kitten and the Gis and her brother were the only available babies at the moment, so he was scooped up immediately. Kittens usually aren‚Äôt allowed to leave the shelter the same day they‚Äôre adopted, I think usually due to multiple applications coming in and screening possible pet parents, but thankfully I was allowed to take the Gis the same day! We needed to go back about once a week for vet visits for shots, deworming, and due to her digestive issues but they knew she‚Äôd cope better in a home than in the shelter once her brother was taken home!

Fun fact! Their estimated birthdays are Valentine‚Äôs Day!"

She picks up her toys and throws them for herself using her claws, begs for attention with her paws, scoops food out of the bowl with her paws... you get used to it! She‚Äôs too cute to be mad at!"
cats,ffjmja5,t3_etzqnk,1580001688.0,"(all mentions of abuse will be placed in parenthesis and are only in the first paragraph, there are mentions of animal death)

Full story: 

(A good samaritan found the Gis and her brother tied up in a garbage bag next to a dumpster. They were only a month old and were left with their deceased siblings and mother. We‚Äôre unsure if it was a birth gone wrong and the mother and siblings died, or if this sick human being killed them. Due to the ages of the Gis and her brother were assuming it was abuse. The Gis has some digestive issues that could be deadly in kittens, so we sometimes wonder if that‚Äôs why her siblings died rather than considering what she may have went through for that first month of her life).

They were taken to a shelter where they were evaluated. Her brother was generally unharmed and acted like any normal baby, but the Gis was traumatized. She was terrified of humans (especially men), and any unexpected noise or movement would leave her cowering in fear. She had severe separation anxiety when her brother was placed in the kitten kennel so she was put in the pen with him. I happened to go in a few days later and as soon as I saw her I knew we were meant to be together.

I was only 18 and the women at the shelter tried to convince me that the Gis was unadoptable, as she thought she‚Äôd never be a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù cat and would inevitably be returned to the shelter and euthanized. I immediately adopted her and brought her home. Thankfully she got along with my male cat (Dax) who was also abused (rescued from a hoarder) but it was a long, uphill battle. I would have to wrap her up like a burrito to socialize her, and she hadn‚Äôt learned how to clean herself yet so I had to wipe her butt when she used the bathroom and gave her sponge baths with a warm, damp cloth. 

She barely ever left my room besides getting food and using the litter box, and any sight of my mom would send her running back to my room and under the bed. She immediately showed some signs of improvement, because while she was still terrified of other people (and of me a lot of the time) she would purr during our socializing sessions.

Within her first year she started to lay in bed with me, at a distance and ready to jump, but this showed she was learning to trust me! Within the next 2-3 years she allowed me to pet her for longer amounts of time on her terms, but she would not allow any handling. At 4-5 she began to sleep next to me and would follow me around the house. She loved to be pet but would easily get frightened. She has changed so much within this past year! She lays in my lap, begs for attention, and purrs basically constantly. I still can‚Äôt handle her, but whenever I‚Äôm home she‚Äôs always right next to me, begging to be pet. I love her more than life itself, and it breaks my heart knowing that so many cats like her aren‚Äôt given a chance. She has become the sweetest, cuddliest, most misunderstood cat I‚Äôve ever had the chance to meet. She has special needs and some brain damage, but I wouldn‚Äôt change her. She has PICA (most cats try to eat plastic and yarn, but the Gis will try to eat anything bite sized; glass, rubber, coins, dust, lint balls, litter... it‚Äôs a constant battle!) and digestive issues, her short term memory is awful, and vet visits are super scary because of her fear of humans, but every second with her is worth it.

She had returned the favor and gave me a reason to keep on going through the hardest moments of my life. At times I felt the world would be better off without me, that my mom and boyfriend would be relieved if I was gone, but I knew the Gis wouldn‚Äôt be able to cope without me because I‚Äôm the only one she knows and trusts. She‚Äôs lived with me and my boyfriend for three years now and while she allows him to touch her I know she wouldn‚Äôt have any quality of life without me. So too bad for her, she‚Äôs stuck with me for the long run!

Every day she‚Äôd follow me to class or the store. I knew she passed when she didn‚Äôt greet me in the backyard like usual. I think she ran away to die because she didn‚Äôt want me to find her like that. That cat was probably the most intelligent cat I‚Äôve ever had!

He was a huge trouble maker but got a little better when he got fixed. He was cuddly sometimes, but mainly liked to wreak havoc lol, a few times he knocked the TV over. He‚Äôs 8 now, but when he was 7 he got very sick for the first time in his life. After a few vet visits and lots of IV meds he was getting better. As soon as he was home he‚Äôs so much cuddlier! He sleeps next to me every night, follows me all around the house, and he still has his moody moments but within the hour he‚Äôll be back in my lap.

I‚Äôve always loved him more than life itself, he was my reason for not committing suicide during the hardest moments of my life, and our relationship now is even better. It‚Äôs awful to know that he‚Äôs now an ‚Äúelderly‚Äù cat and I‚Äôll eventually have to say goodbye.
