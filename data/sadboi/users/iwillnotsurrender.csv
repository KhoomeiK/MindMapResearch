I didn't read the interview so I don't know what the situation was. If he wasn't out at the time, people shouldn't be making a big deal out of it. I'm just telling you what he said in the interview.

EDIT: Just read an interview with Saff. He said:


""In Tiger King, Saffery is identified by a name he doesn't use, and referred to using the wrong pronouns. “I don’t care if they’re calling me she; I don’t care if they’re calling me he. On a daily basis, I am called 17 different things. I never really took it to heart.

""I love being able to speak on this,” Saffery says. “Obviously it’s not something that I’ve even actively participated in ever, so, for context, my conversation with Rob was that he asked me, ‘What do you prefer? Saff or Kelci?’ And of course I said Saff because that’s what I’ve been called for the past 20 years. I was in the Army prior to the park and they always use last names. So, Saff was my preferred name. And I’ve always gone by him since I could say that out loud. My family was always very supportive—it was never an issue.""""
