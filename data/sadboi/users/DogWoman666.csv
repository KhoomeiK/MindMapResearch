bipolar,f1aycm3,t1_f1axvaw,1569314005.0,"To clarify:

Educate yourself on meds, as you seem to be doing, keep learning. Psychiatrist wants to help, only knows what you convey in words. Write down all your symptoms, really think. Highlight top 5. Number them #1 being the worst.

Start there. 

Find meds that focus on those specific 5 s. (More or less, just keep it reasonable.) 

Know what meds you want before your appointment. 

[if any of this is preachy my bad, I’m tired & wanna share bc I relate to your post & juuuuuuuuust finally got on what feels like a stellar combo of pills for my brain but we shall see. I won’t send if I edit so just gotta hit post knowing it’s gnarly, my bad. Hope something clicked & if not disregard the jumble & good luck.]"
bipolar,f1axvaw,t3_cgubi9,1569313197.0,"I feel ya on losing faith in meds & then revisiting after some ups & downs, sounds just like me. Swear I’ve tried everything they have, evidently anti-depressants (SSRI’s) can trigger mania. I didn’t have a suicidal thought til my docs pez-dispensed every pill on the market; taking something to help kinda became life/death.

People prescribing are just people, whom treat a LOT of people, so do your homework & decide which pill you wanna try. Have a plan & a solid support system. 

Suicidal thoughts/ideations kinda forced my hand into trying lithium, again. Six years ago acting psychiatrist (nurse practitioner) started me on lithium for suspected bipolar.  A paranoid friend urged me to get off bc of health risks. I switched to depakote & went on a vacation & didn’t bring meds - withdrawals, anxiety & stress overload triggered psychosis/possibly mania. Woof.

I bounced around meds trying to find something, all categories, but couldn’t get myself to stick to anything.

Ups & downs, boatloads of mania/possibly psychosis, spirals of suicidal ideations, wicked depression, insomnia.  Anger. Anxiety. Anxiety. Anxiety. Anxiety. 

Wanted to do it no meds.
Loads of pot.
Dumb.

Everything overwhelms me. 
Pot helps a bunch, but paranoia of breaking laws kills the vibe. Debate heavily moving to weed-legal state but not choosing weed over my family. 

So.

Fast forward to now, I started lithium & seroquel a few days ago & so far so good. My mental health providers are not 100% sure if I actually have bipolar, so our plan with this round of meds was to treat specific symptoms.

Friday my doc asked me which symptoms I want to focus on, my immediate response being suicidal thoughts. 

Lithium is evidently has a history of combatting suicide, so this was a no-brainer for me. The last time I tried lithium, 5.5-6 years ago, was the last time I held a full time job. The med has been around for awhile so that set my mind at ease. I’m going on four days, thinking I need a higher dose bc I’m flirting with mania but not quite manic. Suicidal stuff seems less but it’s only been 3 days so idfk yet.

Seroquel is what psych wards shoved down my throat & I distinctly remember being able to sleep & having control of myself when the nurse Ratchets swarmed. 

When I give in to take meds. I need them to work. Not in 6 weeks, now. This is why I chose two big boys, don’t have patience or motivation or discipline to keep taking a pill & hoping it works. 

Also I hate taking pills & loathe schedules & anyone dictating even a moment of my time; so I take my pills at bedtime & this has been working well for me. 

I don’t always want to sleep, so having a pill that helps my body turn down for rest is worth it. [seroquel]

As for the psychiatrist doling meds, use this to your advantage. Keep asking questions on here til you figure out what cocktail will cover all your bases. 

Focus on symptoms, what specific problems would you like the meds to help with?

Depression, for me, is a result of isolating & racing thoughts. Crashing after mania. Self loathing.  

Taking a med that gets me out of the house kinda kills the depression before it starts. Squashing the anxiety & halting racing thoughts helps me organize my day with a smidge of clarity, and I’m only on day 3.

After 7 days I’ll double my lithium intake & lawd I can’t wait. It’s been awhile since I’ve been myself & I was just convinced that lithium was bad, bc my friend’s opinion. Educate yourself. Scholarly articles. Know your symptoms, focus on those & not the overall diagnosis. 

You’ll find your cocktail, I believe it has to get worse before you decide to get better. 

Good luck. 

Keep hashing it out on here & don’t settle.

If not, my bad. If you’re female they prob didn’t bat an eye at blood, and even if you’re a dude maybe they’re thinking you woulda said something if it were bad enough?

Idk, unless you’ve cut before that they are aware of I don’t think they’d automatically assume you’re intentionally behind the mystery blood but that’s just my two cents. 

Talking helps, so please keep posting. Vent it all out, every little whisper of stress; purge. The obvious is to go talk to a professional, are parents supportive of this? As in would they help you find a professional & allow you to keep pride & confidentiality intact? 

I’m rooting for you.

For what it’s worth you sound like a movie/video game character who is so badass but doesn’t see it in themselves. Like Harry Potter kinda, Katniss, type, just blind to your own awesomeness.

Can you try something, if you hate it, no bigs...

Instead of cut, how about run. Run til you can’t. Any outfit. Any shoes. Headphones if you can find them, if not just go. Let the adrenaline of running in public fuel the endurance. Burn off the stress. Get a natural endorphin rush. Feel self pride. It works for me, I’ve never cut but but I’ve never had the urge; my thoughts say die to end suffering. 

I’ve been too lazy to run & swimming in suicidal thoughts. 

You sound young enough to mold a stressful habit into a healthy habit, so maybe if you’re too overwhelmed to run for you, maybe you could run for me. Test my theory. I believe you can stay ahead of the self-destructive thoughts if you keep the adrenaline in your control, which cutting is probably a rush of sorts.

Point is, cutting caused stress bc of the missing bloody pants. A run may sound bad but that’s exactly why I’m begging you to try. Push your comfort zones. Make me jealous & I’ll run too.

This isn’t about me, just trying to find what motivates you. For me, I can help others but struggle helping myself. 

I don’t pretend to know your battle, but I’m intrigued by your entry here & felt compelled to share. Makes me sad that a younger person feels trapped into cutting. Nip that habit & morph it into something that feeds the adrenaline but doesn’t hurt you. 

Running or public speaking. Both exhausting, one super terrifying. More terror equals bigger rush. 

Open mic stand up, go talk about the silly girls in your school? 

Let’s find an outlet for your stress, cutting isn’t the answer. I’m not judging. I’m not preaching. I’m not telling you what to do.

I’m asking you to try to find a healthy release. 

Thanks."

Diary,f06205w,t3_d3q3xa,1568426597.0,"Yowza. This feels like a kick in the face to read, felt like something I could have written.

But not today, today has been a good day. It’s not been a particularly great year(s) but today I pushed myself out of my comfort zone & lent my time, energy, effort, focus, attention & loyalty to my family. The phrase “it’s not all about me” has been thrown in my direction a time or two, but living in such a deep, dark depression made it impossibly difficult to factor anyone else in while every moment was life or death. 

Yes, there are horrible people in this world;
Not everyone is awful. 

Homie I want to blow my brains out most days, but knowing the impact it would leave on my family halts all planning before it turns from ideation into a real thought. I can’t carry the weight of all the evil in the world; things feel bleak & hopeless. However, every so often I put myself out there and find PEOPLE (ohhh how I love to hate all people) who unknowingly inspire me enough to build a tiny shred of hope in my empty cavern of a heart. 

What I’m learning about depression is if I decide to isolate I will remain fucking crazy. The end. 

I have no options aside from forcing fear to fuck off and go beyond comfort and fucking socialize. 

Obviously eat, sleep, safety, shelter and drink water. 

Socializing was natural before I went off the rails, then I withdrew and hated everyone and quit every relationship and gave very little to accommodate the small handful of people who persevered through my social blackout. 

Finally, I feel strong enough to socialize. Travel with my family, which is what I’m doing now. 

Yes people suck and the world sucks, but there is still hope, purpose and great reasons to survive; trick is finding the people who provide this without effort.

You’ve maybe not found your tribe, please don’t quit searching for them. 

What group of weirdos would you blend right in with and be the happiest version of yourself? Find them. If you have friends and family now who you reciprocate love with but they don’t “get” you, that’s fine, keep them, but find your people. You got this. 

Also idk anything other than I’ve been in a my own personal hell for a long time & ive been forcing myself to be there for other people instead of letting depression, fear of abandonment, and anxiety woo me back into another week/weekend of isolating with Netflix, dogs and video games. My isolating game is pretty solid, but if I spend too much time alone, yikes. Paranoia. Fatigue. Insomnia. Sleep deprivation. Hallucinations. Fear. Agony. Grief. Shame. Regret. Self-loathing. Guilt. & the list goes on. I can’t remember the last time I had fun.

Today I had fun. 

Today my brother graduated across the country & I drove out with my sister, begrudgingly & wildly conflicted, and supported him. It’s been an amazing day. I wouldn’t have crawled out of my self-hate pit if I hadn’t have shoved off the voices that begged me not to come. Instead I’m here, had such a nice time with my family, loads of laughs & pictures, just a great time. I didn’t think about offing myself today & really can’t remember the last time I can say I’ve had a full day where I didn’t think about how to die. 

So. 

If my endless rant does nothing more than give you an annoying ear-full, then that’s a-ok with me bc it sounds like you maybe just need a homie to help you figure out what you wanna do with your life; we all need a buddy sometimes. 

What would make you happy? What’s stopping you from going for it? What are you afraid of? How annoying am I? 

Ill shut up, just needed to reply & if I edit I will absolutely erase & not send so I’m just going to let it roll & see what shakes out. 

Your post hit home with me. I know what it’s like to want it all to be over. 

But today, something sparked hope. Hearing about one of my brother’s instructors who went from suicidal to thriving, man, didn’t even know that was an option. Feel like I’m going to live here in Agony City forever. There’s hope, please don’t give up.

Teach your child how to declutter, what helps my nieces & nephews is meeting needy kids who otherwise wouldn’t have toys, books, clothes, etc.

My nieces & nephews are growing up privileged &  their houses are loaded with STUFF.

I don’t remember my mom ever assisting me on getting rid of stuff, or encouraging it, as we didn’t have much aside from handmedowns. As an adult I struggle not only getting rid of stuff but breaking the impulse to drag more stuff home.

Im in the process of forcing myself to unload now, it’s hell but my god is it liberating to unload piles of sentimental stress.

Take a break if you’re worn out but if your house is still cluttered, you still have work to do.

What’s helping me is removing bulky furniture that inevitably houses packed drawers & collects clutter. 

Less is more.

For me, selling is more stress, so I pass things on to friends and family & needy families rather than goodwill. 

Get rid of stuff that you don’t actually use. Including decorations. Less is more. Keep what adds the model home feel and anything else let it go. 

Another trick is using boxes/bins (prefer boxes bc they are free) and load up stuff you’re struggling to part with, throw it in the garage, basement, attic with a date on it. Leave it. When you stumble across it, if you don’t KNOW what’s in that box you’ve not been missing it. Get it out of your life before you open it & have sentimental obligation to re-distribute clutter into your home.

Congrats on your clothes! I just did mine last night & super proud but wanting to go back through and thin my wardrobe again. Keeping versatile pieces & ONLY comfy stuff that fits NOW & I’d wear today. If I wouldn’t wear it as a first option, bye bye. It’s hard, but eventually you’ll need to add a piece or two to your wardrobe & will have a clearer vision of what NOT to buy. 

Also, get a friend/relative who isn’t a packrat to come be the coach/voice of reason. You got this. 

As for your daughter’s toys, she’s young enough to transition into a more minimalist individual if she’s taught now. Clutter is the root of anxiety & depression for me. You’re not throwing her toys away, you’re alleviating distractions so she has free access to her creative side.

Artists used to fill their studios with all their favorite stuff to inspire paintings, but as time passed they realized all that stuff was actually blocking their creativity. Stuff is distracting. Hence art studios being completely free of clutter.

Your daughter is learning from you. Do you buy stuff every single time you enter a store? Always? This is teaching her to do the same. Window shop. Browse. Even when you stumble across something you NEED & have been looking for, resist. It’s empowering. The sales economy is designed to hook you into a cluttered life. All that stuff isn’t making you happy. Every time you organize it and move it and research how to get rid of it, imagine if you wouldjust unload ALL excess, how much time you would have to catch butterflies & draw hand-turkeys with your 3 yr old? Stuff does not equal happiness, but that little ping of happy when we shop makes it terribly difficult to have that dream home; I want it too. I only ever get close when I pack stuff away and live in my daily space as if I’m visiting; personal items minimal. 

If there were a fire, and you had time to get stuff out, what would you take with? Maybe shove all that stuff in a room/closet so your beloved sentimentals are out of your face (take note of how large that pile is & continues to grow) Then go through & do a massive declutter overhaul & unburden yourself of money “wasted.” 

Idk if you shop a lot or people constantly give your family stuff, but if you’re cluttered beyond comfort there’s too much coming in & not nearly enough going out. Decluttering isn’t a one time thing, set yourself up for success by instilling a donation/gtfo box/bag/system that is consistently available. Keep going. You got this. Would maybe be easier if whole fam helped, but if that’s too much then send them away for a weekend, enlist help or really good food & music & load boxes. It’s a lot of work, especially getting rid of stuff when you beat yourself up for the price you payed for the item, if you’re anything like me. 

You can do this!! 

Less is more!

You don’t need all that clutter.

Every cabinet.
Every drawer.
Every closet.
Eventually! 

I’m learning as I go & research a ton & by no means have it all figured out but I feel like we are in similar boats. Did not mean to come across as all-knowing or preachy, just excited to actually talk about this bc my clutter has been drowning my ability to clearly have a plan for my life. Time to change it all. No more impulse buying. No more yes yes to anything free. No more self-loathing for a messy house. Less stuff means less stuff to dust, clean, organize, sort, etc etc.

Whew.

I did the whole social media on mania extravaganza & have been slowly healing from that train wreck ever since. I have been kinda off-grid for a few years and keep close contact with very few people and even have those at arm’s length. Something about fully trusting people is absolutely impossible once I’ve lived through all the psychosis & paranoia. 

Thanks for sharing. pm me if you’d like to keep writing about your highs and lows, or here works too I’m just not as brave about sharing all the crazy shenanigans I’ve gotten myself into. 

On a super positive note, you recorded an album!? How incredible is that?

The friends that didn’t make it through your darkness maybe didn’t need to be there and your subconscious kinda helped you weed them out. It’s easy to romanticize about how great people are when they are no longer around, but let’s not forget that they kinda bailed on you in your darkest hour. I have to remind myself that I’m still healing and the friends tough it out through my years of struggle may or may not be in my life in a few years and that’s only 50% on me. Those who don’t support me taking care of myself aren’t ones I need to sacrifice & gamble my sanity to keep in my life.

Hope you appreciate yourself, even through all the madness and chaos. It’s tough, I know that, but everyone has some crazy in them even if they never let anyone else see it. 

Thanks so much for writing and please write more if you it flows, it’s incredibly comforting to read (idk how to word that) but it greatly helps me know I’m not the only one 😊"
bipolar,ey7cmu2,t1_ey7cc42,1566878440.0,"Ahh thanks for this, love hearing about successful people who know the struggle. 

As for your lsd induced mania, yikes. How freaky was that? I can somewhat relate, as my first “episode” I swear I was drugged, was in a foreign country where drugs are rampant so it’s not unheard of but I’ll never actually know if I just went bananas all on my own or if some sort of pill was involved. Either way it was a freaky time that haunts my ability to travel to this day. 

Thanks for sharing, I appreciate it greatly!"
homeless,ey7akrt,t3_cvwgp1,1566876563.0,"Congrats on your new found freedom!

Check out Hobo Ahle on YouTube, she started living in her car just between apartments and kept doing it, going on a few years now. She’s doing the vanlife now & it’s incredibly inspiring. 

You can park & sleep at most Walmart’s, if it’s not allowed signs will be posted. 

As for showering, getting a gym membership seems to be popular for people living in their vehicles. Be weary of contracts as I’ve noticed a lot of people mentioning they are difficult to cancel as well as hidden fees. 

Good luck to you, have faith in yourself, you can do this!!"
bipolar,ey792cj,t1_ey78j31,1566875266.0,"Ahaha! Omgosh I relate so much to finding literally any other reason for me spazzing out, brain injury & all that! I made the mistake of heavily involving my family and it was absolute hell, bipolar became my entire existence & now I’m just trying to find a psychiatrist who can really break it down for me & let me know, with confidence, that there is a life to live even with bipolar! Thanks for the reply, I hate that anyone else suffers but gawd it’s nice having people to relate to!"
bipolar,ey769jg,t1_ey73cjl,1566872982.0,Hallelujah!

bipolar,ey70lbo,t1_ey6zb8t,1566868596.0,Thanks for your reply :)
bipolar,ey6zpq8,t1_ey6z49j,1566867917.0,"Excellent question, idk, maybe I am in fact not bipolar, I just feel like I was so hell bent on not being bipolar that I refused to accept the diagnosis."

homeless,ewc41ks,t3_cmx600,1565277607.0,"You’re welcome. I wish I knew the right things to say or places to send you to get help. In my state there are food pantries where you can go to get free meals, and offices that will help you get back on your feet. Social services of sorts. I’d imagine there is someone at your college who can point you in the right direction. 

I don’t understand how financial aid works, I thought you didn’t have to pay anything until you were finished with school. 

You have options. Have you begun applying for jobs? Anything just to get some cash together to get sorted? I’m just throwing out ideas. 

There are places in the world where you can work on farms for free accommodation, WOOF is what you’d wanna look up if this sounds appealing at all.

Otherwise you can enlist in the military, I did 4 years in the Air Force & my school was fully paid for after. It’s not as scary as it sounds, plus you don’t need any money & you will make loads of friends. Also you will be a beastly version of yourself. Don’t go into this option without careful thought. PM me if it seems like a good idea & I can help answer questions. 

If you can fit everything you own into a backpack, maybe this is an opportunity to travel and see where you actually want to be? 

Just know there is someone in Iowa who genuinely cares and wants to see you thrive. This situation sucks, but it is your welcome fiesta into adulthood. This can only break you if you let it. 

Pm me to vent. I really do believe you can handle this and will be stronger because of it. 

Good luck today & well done on selling some of your stuff.

I hope you are eating 😁"
homeless,ew5rp94,t3_cmx600,1565143426.0,"You can handle this!

Do you have a car? Can you stay with a friend? Have you connected with a professor who could help you navigate this situation? 

You will get through this. Breathe. 

I am sorry you are going through this. You can handle this.

You are strong."
