When I got diagnosed anxiety and depression it helped me realize that I was ""different"", that I shouldn't care what everyone else thinks about me, that I actually matter, and I have been on meds and, well, I still struggle, but it somehow helped me, personally without diagnosis or someone to tell me that my struggles actually matter, I am not sure what would happen, I was in a very dark spot where I managed to drag everyone around me down with me, ruined a relationship for probably other reasons too, but it was just a mess.

&#x200B;

What I would recommend to you is to write a diary, just simple things like how your day was, what occupied your thoughts and so on and if you decide that you want to seek professional help the diary will be a VERY useful resource to them since it is so much easier to think back and be like ""it probably was horrible"".

&#x200B;

I do believe we all struggle somewhat with a diagnosis or not, we all need to take care of ourselves and it is really hard in some cases, professional help or community help, whatever works for you and whatever options you have."

OCD,ffzw4br,t3_ew5ygq,1580394432.0,"First of all, no one here can diagnose you, if you are concerned you might have OCD or any other mental illness you SHOULD seek professional help or talk to your doctor about it (not sure how doctors in other countries are, but in Norway they do what they can to help you, even talk, and I should also mention that my doctor is also a certified psychologist)

It sounds like you have intrusive thoughts, from my understanding also known as unwanted thoughts, they can be horrible and violent, they can be of children, elderly, loved ones or just random people, and they are awful.

In OCD the main reason for getting a diagnosis from DSM-V(5) is that you have obsessions e.g. Can't touch or be near things because then I will be contaminated, intrusive thoughts. And also have Compulsions like excessive handwashing to get rid of contamination, checking, mental rituals and so on.

I think you might want to get checked for an anxiety disorder instead, but of course get checked for OCD aswell, I am NOT certified to diagnose or to self diagnose you, all I do is provide information my psychologist told me, I fulfill a lot of the requirements, but I am not diagnosed with OCD"
