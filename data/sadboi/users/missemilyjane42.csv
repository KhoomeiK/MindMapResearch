Most of the current mines are in Northern Saskatchewan, but there are also closed mines in Northern Ontario (and not too far from where this map's District 13 borders).  Maybe this information could play into a general Hunger Games scenario - especially when you also consider almost all post-apocalyptic fiction describes Canada as automatically annexed to the US in some form or another.

The names on my list are Canadian famous and I'm not sure how well some of them are outside of the Great White North, but I don't care because they're good people and deserve the shout out.

1) Chris Murphy, bass player and defaco frontman of Sloan. Growing up, Sloan were as just perfect as a band could be far as I was concerned, and Chris, in particular, was one of my heroes as a bass player growing up. Problem was, I was a bit of a loner in my love for Sloan when I was in high school and I had a lot of friends try to convince me that the band sucked, and the dudes from the band were assholes. Fast forward several years later to when I'm of age to attend 19+ shows. I'm still a fan because Sloan doesn't know how to release a truly shitty record (they have ones that are subpar in relation to others, but they're never complete write-offs) - and I learned very quickly that Chris Murphy, specifically, greets fans after every show. The others make appearances from time to time, but Chris has figured out the benefit of being patient and connect with fans - even the obseesed ones. He's a good dude, still my hero for his generosity, and absolutely not the asshole everyone tried to lead me believe.

2) Steven Page, formally of Barenaked Ladies. BNL were another *very* big deal for me in high school. They were the first band I became obsessed with that weren't the Beatles; and through them, I was introduced to Sloan. I am sad that I never got the chance to photograph a BNL show with the classic line up. But I have done a number of Steve's solo shows, and have had the opportunity to chat with him a few times as a journalist and as a fan.  When I had the opportunity to interview him, it was one of the rare occasions where I was genuinely scared to talk to a musician, because all I could think of was being 15 and attending my first BNL show; but he turned out to be one of the humblest musicians I've ever met. It absolutely felt like he was as flattered that I want to talk to him as as I was honoured to interview him.  Such a great talent, and I'm so glad he's doing absolutely amazing work. (Side note: his guitarist on tour, a dude named Craig Northey, is a legend in his own right with his band, Odds.  On top of being the one major rock star who consistantly remembers me and who I was when I started doing the media work, his band were one of my first major followers on Instagram - and they started following me before I started following them.) 

3) Max Kerman, lead singer of Arkells. I've crossed paths with him a few times (last year he was very kind to a very drunk me who wanted a selfie with him at an after party) and I have at least one mutual friend who does confirm to Max to being as generous and genuine as he comes off as.  But the thing that's making me feel like he's basically one of the best human beings on the planet right now is that everyday for the past month, he's been giving ""music classes"" to his followers on Instagram. To watch him interact with his fans has been one of the happiest things I've seen online through this crisis. He loves what he does, he loves that he's helping people get through this stupid time, and it feels like he's having the time of his life regardless of how miserable things are right now."

I know it's probably not the best idea on the face of the planet; but as a music photographer, live music has been my life for the past few years. My heart has been smashed twice so far. I was scheduled to do photos at the Junos and was actually on the ground in Saskatoon less than 24 hours before they cancelled it; and Sloan's spring tour was scheduled to go through Montreal on my birthday at the end of April. I had a big awesome day planned for that one that included a big sandwich from Schwartz's. Now I'm going to be lucky if I'm able to order in and sit on my front stoop with Sloan playing over my Bluetooth speaker.

So now I'm sitting at home, which is generally fine because I don't mind being alone at home like this (three consecutive summers of unemployment absolutely prepared me for this), but I've ended up spending most of the time going through years of photos on several hard drives and taking time out of my day to watch the delightful Max Kerman teach people how to play Arkells songs on Instagram - so now I'm driving myself crazy because all I really want to do is plan a roadtrip to Hamilton for the Rally in June (maybe see if I can score a press pass, mainly because I know I won't be able to leave my camera at home), but even I'm super aware it's probably going to get axed at this point.

At the very least, there had better be a Live Aid-style celebration when everyone around the world is allowed out.  We're going to need the pick-me-up.

Not to mention, it could leave those of us living in downtown Hull in a very undesirable position. I've purposely have gone into Ottawa to go to the Shopper's on Bank St for groceries because a) its almost $1.50 cheaper to get certain staples like milk in Ontario and b) I find it quicker because instead of waiting for a bus that only comes once every half hour to take me back and forth between my house and Maxi/Walmart, I'm only waiting five minutes max for any one of five buses to get me back and forth between the stop at Bank and Wellington. (And I get a bit of a walk in, which is nice.)"

AskReddit,flchoaj,t3_fnszg7,1585031254.0,"When the Juno Awards were cancelled.

The Junos are Canada's Grammy Awards. Massive deal for me. I'm a bit of a failed musician, and after wishing for years that I could have a foot in the door of the music industry in some capacity, I took journalism in college and have become a concert photographer.  I've now done media at four Juno Awards. 

This year's Junos, scheduled to be my fifth and first in a city and region I'd never previously been too, were in Saskatoon, SK. I actually purposely bookmarked extra time to explore the city before all the events started.  There was zero intention of cancelling the whole thing - even when I boarded my flight on the Wednesday, organizers were determined not to cancel. I was on the ground in Saskatoon less than 24 hours before the entire thing was called off. I was scheduled to fly back the following Tuesday, and I was determined to stay and just have a staycation in a different city. The weeks leading up to my trip were extremely difficult and a burden on my mental health, so I just wanted to make the most of my booked PTO.  By all intense and purposes, I probably could have hung out for a bit as domestic flights haven't been completely restricted even now; but family back home in Ontario began to panic about me being so far away. (Canada's big, yo!) So they scrambled some money for me to fly home Friday, and I came back exhausted and completely destroyed by the whole thing.

It was not a good time. Saskatoon is lovely from what I saw of it, though."

Anxiety,fl64fad,t1_fl5hj7r,1584854104.0,"The weird thing about the media saturation after 9/11 is that I think it's probably the one thing that, low key, shaped who I became - a nervous, anxious wreak of a human being in every way, shape and form EXCEPT for when it comes to news media.

I was 16 in September 2001 and I was absolutely obsessed with the idea of taking music in college - but that particular semester, ended up taking a lot of communication and media courses, thinking radio was going to be my plan B if progressing in music wasn't in the cards. I actually don't remember finding the news coverage to be overwhelming; and even made sure to find physical media (newspapers, magazines) to kind of put in a memory box. I very much embraced news media, and it followed me for years. When I was ready to try college again (after at least one failed attempt), I chose journalism as my focus.

That said, I will admit with the rise of social media, the news became too much; but because of my media background and a little bit of CBT therapy thrown in for good measure, it's not an issue. I actually turned my radio off completely after the 2016 election because I couldn't handle the winner's voice anymore, and cutting back on my social media use was a lot easier than it's been to stop touching my face.  These days, social media gives me the general headlines, and I carefully fill in the story by researching what I need to know to fully educate myself on world issues. That said, I miss the radio dearly because a silent house is not my favourite thing on the planet, but removal of that anxiety made it worth it. 

Now in this stupid dumbfuckery, I'm finding that because I don't consume the news media at the frantic pace comes at us these days, I'm actually not scared at all of what's happening. Like, I completely understand that its serious and would be in my best interest to stop biting my nails, but I'm not scared because I read so analytically. I have been able to calmly gather and prepare for what feels to me like an extended seasonal unemployment (I work in a university cafeteria and I was going to be laid off at the end of April anyway), only collecting EI while sitting on my couch playing video games and not finding other work is socially enouraged at the moment. And when I'm on EI, waiting for work to come back in the fall, you're damn right I isolate myself in my house because, with my income limited, it's just best I hunker down and wait for work to comeback. I know I'll get through this, because I've been through it.

What IS causing me stress right now is that my mom just isn't taking any of this well at all, and it's because of everything she's reading and hearing from what her friends are telling her, and I'm internalizing her fear.  I'm trying to get her to use my Disney+ account to watch something I know will help her take her mind off things, and I'm trying to get her to educate herself using the same patient reading I do, but she generally dismisses it as me being analytical - and then tells me it's what makes me smart in her eyes. 

So yes, the news media sucks most of the time. But that doesn't mean you have to let it rule your life.

PS: If anybody wants, I highly recommend two Crash Course series to help anyone who wants a boost to keep their minds aware during this period.

[Crash Course: Navigating Digital Information ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtN07XYqqWSKpPrtNDiCHTzU)

[Crash Course: Media Literacy ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtM6jSpzb5gMNsx9kdmqBfmY)

ottawa,fkzv4or,t3_flkvz5,1584681324.0,"For circumstances mostly beyond my control, this is looking to be my fourth summer in a row unemployed and on EI - but the first time, it's completely acceptable and kind of encouraged for me not to seek summer employment while I wait for my full time job to come back. As soon as I finally find toilet paper (I was out of town when the Great Poop Panic began, and I'm down to four thin rolls of the cheepest No Name two-ply money can buy for my single ass), my to-do list will be fully wiped and I technically shouldn't have to physically leave my home for a good long while. 

Once the shock of not stressing about anything at all finally subsides, I might actually have the mental capacity to actually create *something.* Anything. I'm supposed to be a writer and a photographer, and the anxiety of maintaining two jobs to make ends meet has really taken its toll in the past few years. Hopefully with my mind free and with all the time in the world at my disposal, I might finally learn to sustain my artistic and creative passions. 

Fingers crossed, of course."
