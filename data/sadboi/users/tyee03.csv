BPD,f3wq2sr,t1_f3wlzlc,1571214773.0,I agree. Ive been such a hermit crab lately. Its a relief that im not alone but it sucks that you go through it too. ðŸ’™
BPD,f3tlzwn,t3_di4xqw,1571139423.0,"This fits me to a T. Atleast the last 12 months i have not felt ""genuine happiness"" i just feel empty. Like you know your body and where all your organs are etc. But theres just nothing.. nothings there anymore. Its just a facade that i have to put on because me being unhappy around others brings them down. No one wants to hear about how bad your day was. I always feel like i bring a storm with me everywhere i go. Im sorry you feel this way and i honestly hope you get all the support and help you need whatever that may be. Just remember your not alone."
BPD,eyhnc8h,t3_cx0sot,1567089827.0,"Its understandable, the last two days i have literally had to tell those around me not to leave me alone out of fear ill do something. 
It can be so crippling some days but i swear there is always going to be good days, one thing that will make you smile. 

If possible maybe you can facetime or even call your mum. Me and my mum are quite distant but i still like calling her when im really down. 
I hope it gets easier for you soon, there is always some sort of support on here. If you ever need to chat feel free to dm me."
BPD,eyhk9nn,t1_eyhfco6,1567088481.0,"I relate to this one alot, i know what my triggers are and why i fuck up and always complain and wish i could do better but then my motivation to change is not there. Then i think im a waste of space and that ill never be happy and emotionally eat. 

Last year i went from being diagnosed with bpd and getting really sick and became underweight, threw up all the time, anxiety was at an all time high.. to this year going complete 180Â° and doubling in weight. And ofcorse that made my depression so much worse. 

Im trying to work through it now, had a bad couple of months but im looking forward. 
So i cant really give any advice but ive only just found out theres a Reddit for this and its nice to know im not alone you know."
