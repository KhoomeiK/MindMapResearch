Meanwhile remember that the shadows cannot hurt you. They can trick you and scare you but they are not real. 
Feel free to message me for good advice (on how to deal with them) or if you have questions."

Ok. I'll give it a go :)"
schizophrenia,ewr6afm,t1_ewr679j,1565696141.0,"I'm at least pretty happy with getting it as shots. It also takes away the feeling of being sick, not having to pop pills literally all day every day"
schizophrenia,ewr649s,t1_ewr5w8o,1565695957.0,"Do you get it as pills or as a shot? 
I've never reacted well to anything but Abilify - as a shot! I get it once a month and it's very smooth, after 3 months I'm side effect free. I just get a little tired afterwards because of the adrenaline rush (I fukken hate needles).

If you get pills maybe you could talk to your doc about switching to injections? If it's even a possibility with your current meds ofc."

schizophrenia,ew3i813,t1_ew2yllt,1565080204.0,I know the feeling you're talking about or at least I get a very specific feeling before/with hallucinations as well. But when I'm tired I don't register the feeling before I'm hearing stuff.
schizophrenia,ew291pd,t1_ew244hs,1565041044.0,"Of course! That's a great tip, thank you. I have a dog and a cat so there's always an extra pair of ears to check :)"
schizophrenia,ew1rzk3,t1_ew1rmt2,1565030131.0,Thank you! I guess I just gotta trust myself more when I'm trying to explain them to myself. And not become paranoid.
schizophrenia,ew1rgcy,t1_ew1r6ho,1565029788.0,"Yea yea! I can really relate. Faint background radio music is one of my reoccurring hallucinations. 
But what about sounds that can't be turned off? Any advice?"
schizophrenia,ew1ozn3,t1_ew1o67x,1565028209.0,"Awesome :) that you'll try! 
My ""rules"" are using 5 senses, find 5 objects to look at or even touch and breath and at least 5 deep breaths. Good luck :)"
schizophrenia,ew1jcun,t1_ew1ii3j,1565024649.0,"I'm sorry to hear that. 
I can recommend therapy and doing the work that it requires but also grounding and being in nature has helped me when feeling like everything is wrong/fake. 
The last time I was about to slip into a psychotic episode, I was able to stop it by going outside and really focus on things I know; the smell of the rain, the sounds of  birds chirping and the cars in the distance, the taste of my cigarette.
Feeling the solid ground underneath me pretending that I root my feet into it. 

It sounds stupid and silly but it's worth a try. It helps me feel real and with that my surroundings become real as well. 
Does this make any sense? Do I just sound like a stupid hippie? I'm sorry if that's the case"
schizophrenia,ew0q6za,t3_cm8300,1565001569.0,"I have the same feelings and thoughts sometimes - now after doing weekly therapy for 3 years + being well medicated not so much anymore - and it's very unpleasant and confusing. 
Are you in any kind of therapy?"
