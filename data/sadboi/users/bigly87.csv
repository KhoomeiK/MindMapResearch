relationship_advice,fqmsi0k,t3_gjs597,1589482787.0,"I dont exactly know how she is by your description but I can some how relate myself to her. I'm super super extrovert and my whole life being relied on ""having people around"" if had a free afternoon, I would called 10 people to hang out if 9 of them were busy...Interestingly I realized it end my 20s, when I moved abroad. Imagine knowing little language, no friend and absolutely no hobby that doesnt require someone else to be involved. I absolutely had no idea how to entertain myself...and ofcourse that made me coming ""needy"" in relationships. In the new country I had to move alot again, even though I was fluent in language but boy, was it easy...? I was growing older at the same time and at that some point you prefer have your own safe zone, and not waste your time with people you arnt close to, even if it means watching Netflix by yourself for entire Friday night. Man it took me years to get use to Is...i literally became someone else, do I like it? I dont know; the feeling that I need that person more than she needs me was killing me. Constant feeling that I how needy and weak I am..I'm still struggling to find a way to enjoy my time by myself. Dont know if it helps...but maybe you can understand her more if that's the case. Cheers."

BipolarReddit,focw9oh,t1_focv7bx,1587676715.0,Thanks. Actually that's very true. I just read a simple article and thats how exactly he is. So this has been caused by his severe depression I would guess?
BipolarReddit,foche1l,t1_focg0xw,1587671351.0,Not sure about injections but they gave him antipsychotics in the beginning since he was very delusional.  I should also mention that he has stopped his medication so many times in last 8 yrs On and off + heavy weed smoking. each time he gets worst. Maybe each time stoping medication for months has caused brain damage?
BipolarReddit,fobrg86,t3_g6qn3q,1587662864.0,We were told his blood was tested regularly in the hospital. During last couple of months

So many symptoms can be in common  and also some different in different people. Your adhd might be different than mine. Put some time on it, i would  say and therapist help for sure.  Cause i can feel how much ADHD is affecttig my life and accomplishments in my 30s way more than 5 years ago.

sexover30,fh99o61,t3_f1hocw,1581376240.0,"Thanks everyone for responding. The only and only reason that i believe that I know women body in general is because i have been told in my relationships...and if they were not honest in period of 4yrs or 2yrs or couple of times hookups...then i dont know how to measure my skills or expand my knowledge and i do believe that everyone's body and preferences is different.  
However this current case was something that i never encountered in my life. The fact that someone can love another but not enjoying making out with them is very strange in my experience but now i know it exists. 
Thanks for your time comments again."
