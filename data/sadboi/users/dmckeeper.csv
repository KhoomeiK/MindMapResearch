mentalillness,fjgcs84,t1_fjfwxii,1583322231.0,Sending you lots of positive vibes. Keep fighting. You are not alone. Message me if you need anything.
mentalillness,fiy1e1a,t3_f9gpqr,1582830572.0,"Hi! 


Internet stranger here, and I am not in your shoes, nor have I been. Instead, I am in your husband's shoes. My wife is currently receiving treatment at a local facility. I love her with all of me. To the depths of my soul. She has many issues that have never been truly delt with. Counseling here and there through the years, but never anything substantial. Things get better, but always regress and I understand that is typical with mental health issues. 

I want to give you some prospective from the other side of this issue in hopes of letting you in to the impact mental health has on the ones around you. This is tricky, I know. It is a mess for everyone. I in no way mean to downplay or degrade what anyone goes through with mental health. It is serious and complex. The brain is so powerful and not dealing with the issues you face personally, makes it extremely difficult to relate and respond. 

For me, and I can only speak for me in my situation, it isn't that we want you to act like you don't have these issues, but understand the impact they have on those around you who love and want to support you. I want my wife to get the help she needs, and it is incredibly difficult for her to see how bad things are in the moment. We want to help, and often have no idea how to do so, so we are helpless. Begging for her to get help, watching the help that is offered be turned away. I know that is part of the illness, but from the outside, it doesn't make sense. She knows she needs help, but refuses the help from professionals at every turn. That becomes frustrating and disheartening. If she loves her family so much, why not get help? All part of the illness, I know. 

As for the kids, there has to be some level of protection. Some consistency in their lives. As a parent, and partner, I have to file for full custody in the off chance something happens. I don't suffer as my wife does, so clearly I have to be the parent here. My wife is unreliable and when she hits a low, it can become dangerous. It is my job to protect my child. That isn't saying she is a terrible person who can't be trusted, but that responsibility has been thrusted upon me to act in my childs best interest. My little girl needs her mom, but a healthy version who makes sound decisions while in mom's care. Every parent should want that. Every parent should fight to ensure their child grows up in a safe environment. If my wife's actions seriously hurt my child, the impact on her mental health would be beyond repair. My wife would not survive that trauma. 

You are right, those of us that don't suffer as you do, do wish this wasn't the case and wish there was a way for you to act normal, but it is way deeper than a quote from a terrible comic book movie (we can argue about the movie). That is such a simple look at how the outside views mental health and does little to forward the conversation from either side. We want the hurting to stop for everyone. I don't want my wife to pretend she doesn't have issues, I want to help her work through them and be the best person she can be, for her, for her family, for the ones that love her. 

Again, I do not wish to downplay how you feel, or anyone suffering through this. Your issues, my wife's issue, and everyone else just trying to survive this, are serious, deep, and painful. I hope you get the help you need. I hope this for everyone reading this. There are people that love you and want to support you. There are people that want to see you grow through this. There are good days and bad. Highs and lows. You don't have to pretend to be anything. You are who you are and if anyone tells you otherwise, fuck em. You don't need that. 

To all of you, keep fighting. Keep going. Keep living the best way you can."
