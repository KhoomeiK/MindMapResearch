solotravel,fp49xaw,t3_gb8bcp,1588294622.0,"For me it was last year when i went to Japan and went on a guided tour to a park not far from Mt. Fuji and to 5 ""sacred lakes"". When we got to the lakes we had time to walk around and this is when i found out that solotravel was the best way for me to travel. I didn't have to worry about another person not liking the things i wanted to do and none could tell me that watching a guy cook nuts under high pressure for 15 minutes was boring. It made me realise that ive missed out on so many trips because i didn't have a person to go travel with me. And that's why I'm planning a solo trip around the world ( kind of )."

Go on a trip somewhere, go out once a week or even one a month. You just have to take baby steps and when you notice you can do more you can go out more and travel more etc. At one point you will have done so much travelling and going out that you'll want to take things slower and at that point you will have done everything you've wanted.
P.S. I'm 21 and I'm still travelling and going out and i think I'll slow down when i have a girlfriend and want to buy/rent a home.
Good luck with this, you'll figure it out."

I found this design on a reddit post from 1 year ago and at the generator section you only need 2 hydrolic presses, you can put the engine crafter down a bit and add another starter and press for engine/1s. At the top you can turn the copperwite makers and add another roller so that you dont need the left separator.
