Maybe she thinks she has the magic egg that can convert a deadbeat into a prince. 

Or maybe she thinks her options are limited since she's saddled with one unsupported child, and the best she can do is get with someone who doesn't have a problem with that. (Not saying that's the reality, I'm saying she may have esteem issues and thinks she doesn't deserve better.)"

Anxiety,f7drauk,t1_f77k0gj,1573626429.0,"I'm glad to hear it! I'm working on more covert ways to do this when I'm work. A good one is to go for a ""bathroom break"" and run up and down the stairs (they're pretty private in our building.) Quite a few people do this to sneak in exercise. If you don't like to share that you have anxiety, chalk everything up to trying to get in your daily exercise. Double points if you have an apple watch--it will tell you when to move. If you feel an episode coming on, blame it on the watch and do your routine. 

The chest tightening one is the worst for me. I try to attack that with 50 push ups. If that doesn't work, fast shuffles will. Basically, stand up, and run as fast as you can, in place, making your feet ""shuffle"" on the ground. It looks odd, but it cranks your heart rate up very quickly and burns that nervous energy quickly."
Anxiety,f77egbg,t1_f75fj76,1573453083.0,"I don't know if you're ""using up"" the nervous energy, or if you're providing your brain with an easy explanation as to why your heart is racing. Maybe it's a combination. Anyway, I'm glad it helps. The wall sitting seems to be the best for me, as I carry a ton of stress in my legs. (Plus, it's very easy to do in an office--everyone assumes it's for people with bad backs? Go figure.)"
Anxiety,f77ecqh,t1_f74nmj1,1573452960.0,"The increased activity is just a bonus. The theory is that something that you're unaware of triggered a panic response. (It could be as simple as drinking too much caffeine.) Now, your brain is scrambling trying to figure out why you're heart is racing, and can start inventing reasons (unreasonable stressors) so that the brain and body are in sync. If you don't provide the physical reason (i.e. exercise), then your brain searches for a mental reason (I must be afraid because...) and the brain's reasons aren't always rational."
Anxiety,f74b34u,t3_dubotu,1573400038.0,"I try to make my activity match my feeling, after the fact. 

So, if my heart is racing, I'll do something that will make my heart race. I'll go for a run. 

If my chest feels tight, I'll start doing pushups. 

If I get the funny feeling in my stomach, I'll do crunches or planks.

If my legs get a nervous, twitchy feeling, I'll do a wall sit.

I think once my brain and body are synchronized (my heart is beating fast BECAUSE I'm jogging) things get back to normal. Either that, or I've burned off ""nervous energy""

It's a bit more difficult to pull off in a crowded office, but it still works. (I'll just make an excuse that I'm ""stretching"" or ""my foot is asleep"" something.)"
