BPD,fqd6l65,t1_fqd2w3z,1589281489.0,"I'm so glad you've found some value in it! I 100% agree about the ""high,"" the way I've described it to people is, it doesn't get you high but it gets you ""not-sober"" which I think is deadass that relaxed cigarette feeling. I didn't even consider the flavor because I have always mixed my green with flavored tobacco which kind of dominates the flavor. When you smoked it in a bong, did you notice a big build up of resin getting on your lips? That's been my biggest issue (but I continue to smoke in the bong because the flavor is masked by the tobacco.) 

I'm also glad to hear it worked to lower your tolerance because as soon as my wife is done with her whole pregnancy thing, I'm going to take advantage of that. Weed was just not not not getting me high anymore, and I did not have the impulse control to take a T break."

I am on SSI disability (I’m actually not sure which specific diagnosis I have that enables me to be eligible, it could have been Tourette’s but I believe it was “social anxiety.”) I would have never in a million years gone through the process by myself, but my county mental health center assigned me a case manager who knew a tonnnnn about it and basically held my hand through the whole thing. It was comparatively painless. 

Be patient with yourselves, you deserve patience with this, check out your local resources, shoot them an email or even have someone call for you if you can’t. The sooner you get the ball rolling, the better.

Good luck my friends."

BPD,fkg0upl,t3_fi06qa,1584147179.0,"My girlfriend (who has BPD) and I were all day every day smokers, at least 1 bowl every 2 hours for over 2 years without fail. We are now over two weeks sober from THC, and this has been the easiest time I've ever had quitting.

CBD Dry Flower changed the motherfucking game. It smells, feels, and tastes just like regular green. My THC highs were already milded out because of my tolerance, the high from the CBD dry flower is almost identical to the high I got after increased tolerance. The only side effect (including psychological ones!) I encountered switching from plain Mary Jane to CBD dry flower was my hands/body still got super sweaty from the lack of THC. 

Maybe something to consider for anyone out there who feels dependent on weed. Before, if I thought I might have to go a day with no green it would be full body panic attacks. Now I feel a lot more in control, so that even if I go without the dry flower I know it'll be all good. 

Plus, I think CBD dry flower is legal in most places (at least in the US) so you never have to worry about a dealer and shit."

You don’t even have to outright say it, certainly not in the first session, most therapists will be able to discern a lot of what you mean. Most therapists are also really good at being objective and sort of mentally blocking their natural human instinct to *judge* a situation.
