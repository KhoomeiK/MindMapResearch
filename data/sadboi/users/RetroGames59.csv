meraki,foqpawq,t1_foqou11,1587998322.0,Absolutely will do ! Seems I was getting 60mb this morning on 2.4ghz and a little bit over 130mb on 5.0ghz my Xbox which is hard wired directly to the cable modem/router it's getting same speeds. Possible some underlying issues with my ISP.
meraki,fopmk4l,t1_fopmdzn,1587965573.0,Not even getting 100mb.. xD I'ma test tomorrow device directly hooked to cable modem.. worse case scenario I would be needing to buy a faster router..
meraki,fophmyq,t1_fopflcs,1587961729.0,2.4ghz it's on 20mhz 5.ghz it's on 80mhz

meraki,fopdkus,t1_foparoc,1587958815.0,One AP connected to a DOCSIS 3.1 cable modem/router that wifi has been disabled on just set higher bitrates on ssid channels still getting less than 70mbs and I have a 500 mb plan.. I tested with my meraki.com and speedtesf both same problems I rebooted both my AP and cable modem without any changes in using cat5e
meraki,fopat6c,t1_fopankw,1587956945.0,Thank you kind sir I'll try that and report findings
meraki,fopajd8,t1_fopagry,1587956767.0,Ok I'll try to do that change I believe going higher bitrates will disable 802.11.b/g I guess as long as I have ac should be enough

HPPD,fkfosn9,t3_fhvl4e,1584139205.0,Gotta change your lifestyle completely stop doing drugs change your perception of life maybe meditate to relive some of the anxiety have a buddy system when you feel the symptoms are coming back I found out that if I force myself to stop paying attention to them I forget about them.
HPPD,fke792k,t1_fkdzszf,1584106925.0,Well I have seen a tremendous progress since mine started almost three months ago. The depersonalization it's completely gone tinnitus gone my visual snow have decreased tremendously I do believe there is hope at least in my case if they won't go all away I think I'ma learn to ignore them and cop with them. I do think it's all a perspective if you are looking for those symptoms you will see them. Stop doing drugs I do think there is hope and your brain it's very powerful it could heal itself if you do believe it. I'm currently taking 40MG of verapamil daily  and I think it's helping. God bless everyone !!!
HPPD,fkdftxg,t3_fhrfcp,1584077256.0,"I get that vision from time to time, mostly been having visual snow and can't see for shit at night all I see it's pixels and shadows. Been like this for about to be 3 months hopefully my brain can heal itself :("

I won't take any other medications I'm completely aware of my symptoms but won't like to have any other side effects with stronger prescription drugs. I'm going to try exercise and meditation to relive some of that anxiety.
HPPD,fk8ivrc,t1_fk8ij47,1583956888.0,Wow thank you so much for taking the time to explain it very detailed for me i'm currently experiencing some like symptoms and unable to get it diagnosed MRI scans show no noticeable trauma or injury and did two eye exams with an opthalmologist and nothing there either.. my neurologist wants to put me on 40MG verapamil to threat it as migraine with Aura like symptoms. been like this for about to be 3months.
