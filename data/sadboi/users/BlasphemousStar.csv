Sometimes the wrong word comes out despite knowing which word I was trying to say. 

Still beats the shit out of any other side effect."
bipolar_irl,f4ujy9j,t3_dktdfz,1571814115.0,"Yuuuup! But it took years and when I went in the psych basically went ""yeaaahhh... sounds like bipolar!""

I didn't realize the symptoms were symptoms either. Thought they were my personality and I was just a weirdo half the time and depressed the rest. Sleeping around half the time and drinking myself stupid when I was up seemed like I was just prone to benders. 

I also pictured bipolar as more dramatic. Like how it's portrayed in pop culture and didn't realize a mania doesn't have to be full blown psychotic episodes or delusions of grandeur."
bipolar,f4uj825,t3_dluq44,1571813121.0,Even with sleeping pills I'll wake up for a few hours then conk back out again. It's always worse if I'm on too far one end of the spectrum. Might be because I get anxious even depressed too.
bipolar,f4uj4pq,t3_dlqqyw,1571812990.0,"Went blue then bleached out to blonde. (My psych saw the multiple color changes and immediately upped my abilify). I've had EVERY hair color known to man natural or not. Green was not my color. 

I shaved the sides of my mid back hair one night. I giggled while cutting preshave.  Self haircuts with bangs and whatnot. 

One of my tattoos is a special I saw and HAD to have one day. I'm actually attached to it now because I found a way to make it sentimental but it started with $50 tattoo special soo... 

Then I got my nipples and navel pierced in the same day. Lost the nipple rings and had it done again on a different bender a year later. Second time hurts more."

I should be in the loop. I'm important and smart enough to do things people should just trust me because I'm great!

AskReddit,f0almqw,t3_ciyul3,1568516137.0,"I'll tell you how mine dealt with it. 

She listened to what I had to say, requested specific examples of what I was talking about and used a few tests. 

I think it depends on the disorder. It's fairly obvious that if you're impulsively buying everything, getting 3 hours of sleep and getting drunk and sleeping with randos (when this is not usual for you) that you might be a bit manic. 

I can imagine that if people go in and say ""I'm depressed so I need x y and z they're little more skeptical."

A doctor will honestly be a better idea so they can make sure you didn't hurt anything. 

Ice never hurt anyone though if you're in pain and need a temporary solution."
