Anxiety,fqhlq64,t3_fnz5n3,1589379539.0,I feel like May has become the month of crippling dissapointment more than healing. I've never felt this low and depressed in my entire life. Ontario extended their SOE for another 3 weeks and I'll be another 3 weeks after. I just don't know how long I can live life like this.

Anxiety,fpxol91,t3_fnz5n3,1588986475.0,"Does anyone else feel unable to feel optimism? I live in Ontario which has little interest in telling people when we will finally get some sweet relief. Its a snails pace of curbside pickup and opening hardware stores but nothing else.

For me I just cant envision it anymore:( Like I read the good news thread but we've been so entrenched in this that I just think ""this is my life now"" 

My personal situation, no longer have my job (contract not renewed) and have no idea if Ill ever find a job in a wrecked economy. I've developed deep deep depression to where nothing excites me anymore...

I just want this bullshit to end. I wanna live again

And then I saw the press conference. Doug Ford announced his plan and his plan was that his government was planning to have a plan. I thought I was listening to Dutch Van Der Linde from Red Dead 2.

The light at the end of the tunnel was a train and today I feel like an empty shell. This horrible situation has no end in sight here and it feels like an infinite time vortex of shit. I know U.S. politicians have their problems no doubt but at least they seem to have an interest in starting normalcy again. 

Anyway /rant. Not ever allowing hope in again."

The enormity of how long this could possibly go is really eating away at me and i fear Im getting worse and worse.


The uncertainty is killing me. Someone just asked the top Ontario doctor about the now infamous 2022 article and he gave a 10 minute non answer of word salad. No one seems to know when we can even see extended family and friends.

Anxiety,fn81d30,t1_fn7znox,1586731864.0,Most Canadian outlets have been pure doom and gloom (hence why I stay away from it) so this is a welcome change. I hope this holds since we've all been at home for a month.

Anxiety,flwat0f,t3_fnz5n3,1585544521.0,"Hey everyone. This thread has been amazing and has helped me out immensely in tempering my apocalpytic anxieties I have. I really began to spiral the day the NBA was cancelled which felt like a plot in a bad end of the world movie.

Now that we're in the thick of it (im in Canada) I'm not so much afraid of the virus as me and my immediate loved ones are all relatively low risk. My sister is 8 months pregnant which is causing all of us some panic and every day I wake up hoping and praying she's alright before her due date in May.

What my fears are now moving to is the aftermath. How long will life be shutdown? And from that, if it is in the many many months (3, 4, 5, 6??) that are being thrown around in the media for different countries what will the global economic impact be? I am so fearful of a great depression scenario as I am 26 and just starting to get a foothold in my working life. Im also just fearful for the impact on society..


Sorry for the rant and I don't meant to alarm anyone, I've just fallen into a dark place tonight. I feel like I'm mourning my own former life and I'm just so worried it will never return. Sorry again, I hope someone can help me find a bit of perspective. Love yaull and stay safe."
