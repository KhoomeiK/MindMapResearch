Now when it happens I'll feel weird and shitty for a few days or weeks. I'll have low level hallucinations, poverty of speech, and mild paranoia for some of it. Then it'll get worse with delusions and nightmares for a few days. Then it usually goes away.

Avoiding stress, drinking, and paranoia triggers during episodes has helped. I used to let myself spiral out."

I grew up living with my mom in my grandfathers house. My grandfather is a really decent guy. Loves me to peices. Always made sure me and my sister were taken care of. My mom is essentially a depressed teenager. Just goes to work and then plays video games and chainsmokes.

When I was 15 my mother finally got her own apartment. My quality of life dropped significantly after that, and I spent most of my time at friends houses. The apartment was always filthy, there was almost never any food in the house, and we didn't get along. I always faught with my older sister, and my sister and mom were constantly screaming at eachother. I stayed out of my moms hair and did whatever she asked, so she favored me. Still a miserable situation though.

After highschool I couchsurfed while keeping my belongings at the apartment. Eventually some friends got an apartment and I moved in with them.

The day I came back to get most of my things, my sister and my mother were having one of their endless screaming matches over something stupid. My sister just never lets arguements go, and my mom is easily instigated, and its a vicious cycle. 

So I'm quietly packing my shit and my sister starts the arguement up again and I tell her ""if you don't drop it I'm gonna kick your ass"" (which I'm not proud of saying even if I didn't mean it) and my mom starts screaming at me ""HIT HER! FUCKING HIT HER'!"".

Just watching this spineless woman, too chickenshit to abuse her own kid directly so she's trying to instigate it through her 100ILB son disgusted me so much I didn't set foot in there again for a long time. I only got the rest of my things when I knew she wouldn't be there."
