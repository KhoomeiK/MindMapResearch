-Our politicians are all incompetent and corrupt (even tough the corona-crisis makes it look like this isn't the case)

-We are deeply in debt and keep sending money we don't have, even giving other countries money that we never get back 

-We let too many refugees in without any control (Just to be clear : I am all for helping people in need, this is no racist pov) , which lead to letting bad people in too (that's not exclusivelyGermany's fault but it would take to long to type out the Details), which leads to an increase in crime, increase in racist and facist activities and therefore even more crimes. 

- Our politicians ignore the most important problems of the country (we don't have enough teachers, doctors, nurses, police men and a lot of other stuff)


This is only a small part of all the problems we have. Either we will go bancrupt in the next 20  years or so, or our country will destroy itself with a civil war. Either way : We are fucked !"

The light fades, as does the Stench of Hospital and the Sound of the life-supporting machines around you. As your eyes finally are completely closed everything is black and silent. You are dead.

""CONGRATULATIONS - you're our billionth Customer ! You get a free seat beside my Throne!"" a cheery Voice suddenly breaks trough the Peace and Quiet of Death. The stench of sulfur bites in your Nose.
You open your eyes, slowly.
 Before you stands a middle-aged, blond Man in a Suit. You blink. He's still there. You blink again and again. He just stands there, smiling. 

""Wh...Where am I ? Who are you ? I..."" you have trouble getting the next Words out. 

""Ah, yes. Yes you are dead"" the Man cheerfully states ""and I am the Devil. Welcome to Hell!""

You open your eyes fully and take a look around. You are standing in a large lobby-like room. Everything is clean and quite nice looking. The Walls seem to be made from white Marble , decorated with colourful Gemstones. You rub your Eyes in disbelief. 

""I always pictures Hell differently "" is all you get out. 

The Men laughs, his eyes gleaming in a light orange . 

""Oh make no Mistake. Hell is probably just like you pictured it. But this is just the Entrance - the lobby if you want."" He points to a big Window in one of the Walls. You take some slow Steps towards the Window, which is more like a hole in the wall, then an actual Window. As you reach is and look outside you see large rooms, that seem to be carved out if stone, yellow smoke rising from the ground, flames and millions of people in different kinds of torture. You can see them screaming but you don't hear anything. The stench of Sulfur is stronger here then it was in the middle of the Lobby. 

""Wow..."" Is all you can say. 

""Before you ask why you can't hear the screams : After some thousand years they get annoying. So everybody who comes here gets muted. We only turn on the Sound for special occasions"" the Devil jokes. You look at him in disbelief. 
""Don't give me this look. I am joking of course. This Walls are just soundproof.""

You Brain seems to slowly accept the Situation and you seem to be able to think more clearly again. 

""You did say I am the billionth Customer ?"" you ask.

""Yes, because you are. "" 

""How can this be ? There must have been billions before me""

""Oh, there were. But you are the billionth Customer this year!"" the Devil exclaims. 

""Oh, do there are a lot of people in a Seat next to you ?"" 

The Devil laughs. 
""Actually not. We have different prices every time. You are the first one to Win this particular one.""

""And what exactly does that mean for me?"" 

""Oh , it comes with a lot of perks"" the Devil explains. "",First you get your own Demon to serve you, second you will not get tortured  and third you can decide the Method of torture for almost everyone you wish. There are some exceptions where you are not allowed to, but only a few""

At first you are a little shocked by the Power given to you. But then you recognize this is Hell. So, you can't really do any damage with it. There are only bad people here. Your eyes light up. 

""This sounds absolutely awesome!"" you exclaim ""I can't wait to start""

""Great. I am really curious to what you will do with your possibilities. But I am sure it's gonna be legend - wait for it - dary!"" the Devil says with a wink. ""Let's go, I have a lot to show you."" 

In the blink of an Eye your surroundings have changed. You now stand on a Big platform-like rock in the middle of Hell. You can hear the screams and the smell of Sulfur is really hard here. But it doesn't seem to bother you this much anymore. 

""Oh, I forgot to tell you"" the Devil says ""You can teleport all trough hell. Just think about where you want to go and you will be there in an instant. We have a really great Theater down there somewhere you should definitely take a look at sometime"" You are awestruck by this whole situation. The View is gruesome but beautiful in a Way. 

You turn around to face the Devil and see him seating on his throne. It's made of some dark wood, with ornaments and gemstones like you have never seen before. And completly different from what you imagined. Next to him is the same Throne but in a smaller scale and with different gemstones. 
""This is your spot , by the way"" He gestured to the smaller Throne. You slowly step towards it, still not sure if this is all real or some cruel Joke. 
You carefully take place in it and instantly feel powerful and king-ly. 

""Oh and if Course, as mentioned you get your personal servant"" he smiles. ""THOMAS!"" his Voice seems to echo trough all of hell as he yells the Name of your new servant . 

A small, ugly creature materialises out of nothing and appears before your feet. It instantly bows down before the both of you. 

""The Devil ignores the small Demon and looks directly at you. This is your servant Thomas. He will fulfill you almost every wish you have. Be it Alcohol, Sex or whatever else is on your mind."" 

In the next Hour or so, the Devil shows me around. And there is a lot more to see in Hell then I would have tought. Of Course there are billions of torture chambers, but also Shopping Malls, Cinemas, Theatre, Bars. It looks like a whole City in here. 
""My Demons are free Workers"" the devil answers my unspoken question ""they work their shifts and then they have free time. And they like to spend it similar to the way humans do. Of Course there are some differences. Our Alcohol is much stronger, no drugs are illegal and basically anything you want to do you can . Basically this city you see is just the shape of a giant demon-playground"" he smiles. 

""Can I use these things too ? Like the Bars and the Cinema?"" I feel like it's a stupid question. 

""Of Course you can. You are the Co-Devil so to speak. The second King of hell. And they know that. You are free to go wherever you wish , as long as you stay in hell""  He stops as he sees the slightly sad look on my Face ""You are limited to hell, I am afraid. But once a year you can visit earth for a week. You can choose your form and all and basically can do whatever you want . But be warned: There are rules to that, I will explain when needed"" Your face looks a lot less sad now.
""So I basically can go on vacation once a year?"" You laugh. The lord of all evil joins your laugh ""Of course. Not only you, but I take vacation from time to time too. As do my Demons and servants."" You are surprised by all that. 
""It hasn't always bin that way."" the Devil continues ""the Demons formed a labor union some centuries ago. That's when that all started.And I have to admit : It works surprisingly well"" 

You her shown around some more, there are really a lot of different places here. Even Parks and Museums, Coffee-Shops and whatever one can imagine. 

After he has shown me around the Devil leaves me to explore , explaining he has other things to do. 

""Thomas"" I call for my personals Demon. Instantly he appears in front of me. ""Yes, Master ?"" 

""Can you tell me if my Ex-Wife is here ?"" I ask him. 

""Yes, she is. We already checked, as the Lord figured you might want to visit her"" I smile. ""Show me where she is, please"" 
An instant later Thomas and I are standing in a torture chamber. In the middle of the Room there is a Rack where she is bound to. She is naked and bleeding. I watch a Big Demon torture her with all kinds of instruments. Her screams are the hardest I have ever heard. 

""Thank you Thomas"" I turn to my servant ""You may leave now. I want to enjoy the show for a while"" My servant makes a bow and dissapears into thin Air. 

I watch the Torture for a while, registering that they always heal her when the damage is as much as possible and then start again. 

""Excuse me?"" I go to the big Demon that just wanted to hit her with a Baseball Bat , spiked with Nails. 

""Yes Master ?"" 
""Can you Demons change Forms ?"" I ask, feeling stupid.
""Yes, Master . But only to gruesome things. Monsters, Wolf's and cute Bunnies - stuff like that"" 
""Cute Bunnies are gruesome ?"" 
""Of course. When you are not able to cuddle them "" he winks. 
I can't help but laugh. 
""Well, then I think I want to change her torture"" 
""Yes Master?"" 
""She is deadly afraid of Spiders. Would you change your appearance accordingly and use some spiders to torture her ?""
""Of Course Master. Let me just get them "" and with this he dissapears.
I am alone with my Ex-wife for a Moment. 

""I did it my Love. I found a way to be the billionth Customer. And I will get you out of here. But I don't know how. Till I have a plan, I have to let them Torture you more. But I will do my best to hatch a plan quickly"" I whisper. 
Just as I finish my sentence the big Torture Demon arrived again."
WritingPrompts,fj0z288,t3_faqvrl,1582910103.0,"""Gays are the servants of the Devil and God will smite them"" the Preacher bellows trough his Megaphone from his wooden box on the sidewalk of a busy street, encouraged by a chanting and  yelling crowd.

I decide to ignore him, despite being sad that he uses my Words in this Way. As I make my Way trough the Crowd I see a couple walking towards the angry Crowd. It consists of two Men, who are holding hands and just seem to enjoy their Time together not being aware of the Situation they are about to walk into.
As they have almost reached the Crowd, the ""Preacher"" notices them . He turns in their Direction, pointing his finger at them.
I stop in my Step, watching the Situation unfold. 
Of Course I know who this Couple is. I know who everyone is.
I know their Name are David and Thomas. I know that David is a Nurse and Thomas works in an Animal Shelter. I know that they are great People. I know that the only reason they don't believe in me is because every Church they try to join is poisoned with lies and prejudice. 

""See!"" the Preacher yells into his Megaphone ""This Devil-Worshippers are trying to mock us by showing their Sins in the Open""
The Crowd yells. I can feel the aggression rising. The Couple tries to turn around and go the other Way, but are suddenly surrounded by the rowdy gay-hating Crowd. 
Before they can realise a bottle flies and moves towards the loving gay couple. In a blink of an Eye I move myself between them and the bottle, letting it burst on my back. Luckily nobody noticed me teleport to this position as the crowd is distracted with spitting at the Couple and calling them every Name in the Book. 
I turn around, my Eyes angry with rage. 
I usually try not to intervene in humans Life too much, but I am done. Done with the lies, the poison , the hate and all the cruel things people do, using my Name to justify them. 
""Leave this People alone"" I say, my Voice echoing off the Walls from the buildings around us. Heaven thunders as my Voice seems to fill the whole City with thunder. 
Some of the surrounding people look scared, taking a step back. Others just seem to ignore what is happening.
The Preacher seems to be shocked for a second , but unfortunately finds his Voice again. ""Step aside!"" he yells ""Let us punish this Devil-Worshippers in the Name of the Lord!"" I half-grunt, half-laugh at his try to become the center of attention again. 

A smile hushes over my Face, that could almost be described as devilish. I laugh over the irony on the inside, as I speak directly to the Preacher. ""And which God would that be? That tells you to attack 2 people for loving each other?"" 
The Preachers face gets red in anger. ""Which God? What a blasphemous Question that is ! There is only ONE God!"" he screams. 
The Crowd cheers and yells again. 
""And your God did tell you to attack this two people ?"" I ask, calm and almost cold. Doesn't the Bible say ""God is Love""?"" 

I wouldn't believe it if someone told me that it's possible for him to become even redder, but somehow he manages. 

""God tells us not to lay by a Man like you would by a Woman!"" he screams again. I almost pity him for being filled with so much hate. 
""And we have to punish everybody who doesn't follow the Word of the Lord!"" 

""You have to punish EVERYBODY who doesn't obey the Lord ? Must be a hell of a job"" I laugh. He visibly starts to shake with anger. He doesn't seem to like my Humour. 

Without having to turn around I see a Man - a follower of the priest- run towards me from behind, trying to attack me with a baseball bat. I wait till the last second and then take a step to the left , sending him stumbling into the crowd. 

As the Preacher just takes a deep breath to scream about me being a Devil-Worshipper too, I look him in the eyes and say 
""Tell me, what is the highest law your God gives you?"" 
He freezes for a solid minute before stammering “I am the Lord thy God, thou shalt not have any strange gods before Me.” 

""No, No. The other one!"" I say, keeping myself from grining.

The Preacher looks confused. ""What do you mean?"" His Voice is much quieter now. 

""Oh, you know ""Love thy Neighbour"" and all that"" 

""That has nothing to do with..."" he starts. 

""Wrong!"" I let my Voice thunder again. ""It's the most important Rule of all! It counts for everything."" 
The Preacher seem to have lost something on the Floor as his Eyes seem to look for something on the Ground. 
Suddenly his Head jolts upwards ""But the Lord ordered me to cleanse the streets of this evil!"" There is his old , yelling, arrogant Self again. 

Before I can think about it, I hear myself say :
"" I have never ordered anybody to do something. Nor did I order any Wars, Witch Hunts or anything else you have been doing in my Name for the last 2000 Years"" 

The Preacher opens his mouth to scream something again, but one look from me and he isn't able to get his tongue to move. 

The Sky darkens and thunder and lightning seem to surround me as I continue to speak. 

""I am so sick of People like you. Using my Name to spread Fear and Hate. Sick of seeing you do cruel and disgusting things to each other, trying to justify it by using my Name. I never wanted Hate, War or Greed. I sacrificed my Son to show you that I am all about love. And you turned it around and used it to kill and torture each other. I am so sick of it! ""
As my Voice gets louder , and the sky gets darker people try to flee. But nobody seems to be able to move. Lightning seems to hit every corner of the Earth. The contrast of blinding Lightning before the pitch black Sky is as beautiful as it is scary. 

Bursts of light break trough the Darkness as an army of Angels breaks trough the dark clouds. Millions of Angles come flying down to earth, landing on buildings, Crossways, Parking Lots and wherever they find a place to land, till everything is surrounded by big, black-winged Warriors with flaming Swords. 

""This will now end!"" My Voice isn't local anymore. It can be heared all over Earth. ""This are the Lord's Angels. They know my Law, better then anyone else.  Whenever somebody preaches that I hate gays - they will be there. Whenever someone tries to kill someone in my Name -they will be there. They will make sure, that nobody , ever again uses my Name to justify disgusting , inhumane or stupid actions with my Word!"" 

A big lightning seems to hit the center of the earth, piercing the whole planet, coming out on the other side. Heaven thunders . 

Silence. 

It takes some minutes , till the first humans get over the shock and try to understand what just happened. They realize the Angels standing around everywhere. 
The Preacher is one of the last ones to get himself back together. 
He looks shocked and awed. 
""But , But... The gays..."" he stammers. He Coughs, takes a deep breath and holds his Megaphone to his mouth, as he sees one of the angels pierce him with his looks. He lets the megaphone sink, looking defeated. 

By the Time he has realized what has happened, I am long gone. I am sitting on a comfy chair at the Top of Mount Everest and watch as people start to come together, talking about what they witnessed. 

""Pity"" I sigh. ""I really liked this Body. Now I will need a new one"" 
One of my Angels standing next to me. 
I sigh again as kook down on mankind, really curious to see, what their future will bring. 

""Well, let's see want happens in the next 2000 Years"" I think."

I know how you feel. But leaving isn't the only option. 
There are so many things you can do. 

If a party sucks , you can find another party. You can do something to light the Party up. There are so many options. 

As stupid as it sounds : Find something in your life you can change. Doesn't have to be something big like moving to another country, but something small, but important. 

Use another route to go shopping. Take a stroll in a different direction as usual. Do something you don't want to do (that doesn't hurt you) , like going out with somebody for a Coffee or Beer. 
Clean your house/apartment/room. 

It sounds stupid , but doing one small thing can lead to a chain-reaction of events that may help you fell better.

Can we please try to be aware of the people around us ? Even if we have our own depression, our own war inside us, we should try to see when somebody needs help just as we want somebody to notice it in us.

Mental Health and physical health are more connected then most people realize. 

Give the Meds some time and try to do some things your body might need to make the depression at least slightly better (it doesn't always work, but for me it did, that's why I am writing this )

Force yourself to get out. Do a little stroll trough a park or around the block. It might need a massive amount of strength to do that, but fresh air can really help. 

Try to eat healthier - Fresh Food can give you some Vitamins and stuff that your body needs. 

Try to get some sleep. It can help your body to react better to everyday-life.

You basically just need 1 toxic person to make the whole group be a bad idea. And if course it could happen that two or more persons in this group have a problem or an episode at the same time. But that would be manageable. A toxic person however would be worse.

depression,fi2379t,t3_f5ttj2,1582070427.0,"Great Idea. 
Maybe it doesn't have to be Video Games (for people who dont like them) 
Maybe a group of struggling people could motivate each other to go out and do something together. Something you can easily stop when someome gets to uncomfortable. Like Billard or Bowling. Eating Ice-Cream. Small stuff.

But starting with Video Games is a great idea for a group to know each other and get comfortably with each other before they go out in the Wild !

depression,fi0kpxc,t3_f5si2a,1582039202.0,"I don't know if this will work for any of you, but I wanted to share my Experience with this topic. 
I have really hard depressive episodes, where I do basically what OPs Boyfriend did : Put myself in a Bubble and shove everyone away. Be rude to people who love me - sometimes even cruel. 

When I first started dating my now-wife, I was always scared what would happen if I get an episode while we are together. 
I tried to do anything I could to not let that happen. But Depression is a Bitch and there was a Moment were I got grabbed by it and thrown into a really hard Episode . 

I was rude to her, we started fighting, I said mean and cruel things that I would never have said or tought otherwise. 
It took days for me to get myself under Control again and almost a week after that before I dared to call her and talk to her. 

She was really hurt and I think I spend about 4 Hours of just apologizing and telling her I didn't mean what I said till she accepted it .

After I explained to her why I said and did what I said and did, she only asked one thing that helped me a lot :

""Is there something I can do when you have an Episode?"" That's all she wanted to know. She didn't try to ""save"" me or told me to get into Therapy and get my shit together. Or anything else that would have hurt me. She just wanted to know if she can help me. 

We now have the agreement that, whenever I have an episode, she gets a message with just one letter . So she knows that everything I say could be cruel and mean. But not honest or true. And she knows to leave me alone as far as possible, because this way I get over it faster. 


Long Story short : It may cost you a lot, but ask your BF if there is anything you can do. If he finds something, then do it. Even if it means not talking to him/seeing him for some days. 
If not, then maybe you can find something together. 

Don't know if that helps, but I wish you both all the best :)"

I just meant sometimes there is a step between sadness and depression, where it should be possible to find a way to stay in sadness instead of going into depression.

New try:

Usually you don't have the option to decide against depression, but there are some instances where you can see depression coming and avoid it. But that's mostly only possible  for people who aren't clinical depressed. 
I hope I could make more clear what I meant. :("

Sorry for being insensitive, but : If your pet dies, it's okay to be sad. But being depressive for weeks because if it is stupid and it angers me. Because that's a situation where you can DECIDE against being depressed, if you have a medical Depression it's not that easy.
