Maybe I read it wrong but I think you‚Äôre missing the point of that phrase.  The phrase ‚Äúwomen support women‚Äù or ‚Äúgirls support girls‚Äù was started in response to the way that women tear each other down.  Men and women tear women down, so the idea was to stop doing that and support each other.  It doesn‚Äôt necessarily apply to women who suck ass and are mean.

AmItheAsshole,fqhh2r1,t3_giw5q9,1589376852.0,"NTA because you‚Äôre trying to protect your kid.  But, I do think you can handle it a different way so your son doesn‚Äôt feel blamed in place of his friends. Your son is not responsible for the actions of his gross friends, and his sister can‚Äôt do anything about it either.  Your son is the one who needs to tell his friends to stop flirting with his sister, and he needs to be firm about it.  Maybe you can figure out a way for his sister to not be around if he has friends over.  To your son it will seem unfair if his sister is allowed to have friends over but he isn‚Äôt.  

Does he have any female friends? If he doesn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre basically telling him he‚Äôs not allowed to talk to anyone or hang out in person which really sucks, especially if his little sister can still hang out with hers.  

I know exactly what you are talking about, though, wanting to protect your daughter.  It‚Äôs normal and I don‚Äôt blame you for that.  Saying these things to a 14 yo is disgusting!  I‚Äôve been through it myself and have dealt with gross men since I was like 8!  I would be happy to have a parent that looked out for me like that!  However, this solution also harms your son.  I‚Äôm sure he has friends that don‚Äôt hit on your 14 yo.  Maybe let him hang out with his friends at home, but find out which ones are nasty, and which ones are normal, then get rid of the nasty ones.  It‚Äôs a win for everyone. 

Also your son saying he‚Äôs 18 and gonna move out bc he‚Äôs ‚Äútired of this shit‚Äù sounds like he doesn‚Äôt feel heard in your house or that he thinks you do more for your 14 year old than him (I‚Äôm not saying you do, but a response of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of this shit‚Äù sends a message that this isn‚Äôt the first time this kind of thing has happened).

Dreams,fmyvp2m,t3_fy31rd,1586497208.0,"I saw a video about this or read an article about it or SOMETHING because I remember!  It said that many times when people lucid dream, some objects/vision in general gets blurred when they see words/numbers/music/etc.  like if you were to read a digital clock then it might be blurry, or if you were sending a text, or trying to read sheet music.  Sometimes if instead of it being blurry the words just change constantly and randomly.

  I forget why it happens but i think it‚Äôs that many people don‚Äôt have that kind of visual memory.  Like you can think really hard about what a full sentence would look like on a piece of paper but your brain can only think of a few words at a time‚Äî the others get blocked out or the letters get jumbled.

Dreams,fmyuj23,t3_fy7odz,1586496173.0,"Idk being basic here tryna to take a symbolic literature esque approach.

Long story short:  something in the way you‚Äôve dealt with the past is going to change very rapidly and suddenly, which could very well affect your lifestyle even if you don‚Äôt quite notice it right now.

You driving in an old car probably has something to do with the past.  How youve navigated yourself through life, how you‚Äôve dealt with problems, etc.  it‚Äôs basically your way of lifestyle before (somewhat) recently.  

You pass homeless children who say creepy shit to you and then find yourself on a dark road.  Homesless could represent an anxious fear you have a about the future and how you think you could fail/have problems with money, or that you will lose something.  Especially if the children are orphans, a threat of losing something seems like a possibility.


Finding yourself in darkness in literature usually can mean something like having a fear of losing control or not being able to affect your future positively, uncertainty, ignorance, you don‚Äôt know how to solve a current problem you have, etc.

Now this faceless-four-legged monster comes at your car out of nowhere, probably causing much fear.  It launches your 50s car into the sky, potentially meaning that some HUGE CHANGE is coming for your present and past.  Your past actions will change for the better or worse in the future, and how you handle situations will change.  You also have a huge change that effects you physically and in the physical world for better or worse.  

Alternatively, you could feel that some things are just getting worse in life since having a monster barge in on your way of life now is kind of uprooting.  

Especially because this monster is faceless, that could show uncertainty in these eventual changes in life.  It represents how you do not know the outcome of your actions in the future."

Idk what happened to mom and brother, but my dad and I went into a tunnel, the roller coaster slowly passing trophy cases with only the heads of characters of the children‚Äôs show lazy town, then the mayor of lazy town stands at the end of roller coaster tracks with a guillotine, prepared to chop off me and my dads heads.  

I‚Äôve had this dream for 14. Years.  Every time more shit gets added on.  The summary I‚Äôve provided is not all the additions, no, it‚Äôs the very first of this dream I remember having."

AskGirls,fmy1rsq,t3_fxxv4n,1586476300.0,Someone did something that I thought was really nice for me.  It‚Äôs similar.  If you get a shadow box picture frame and put a really nice photo of you two together then put Hershey kisses inside it‚Äôs looks cute plus is sentimental.  You could do this with multiple photos/frames and put different things in it like notes or objects too
AmItheAsshole,fmuve5h,t3_fxbnct,1586399737.0,Jesus Christ YTA i don‚Äôt even understand how you could possibly think that would be a good idea.  your kid is going to hold this over your head for the rest of your life.  This is favoritism at its finest

AnorexiaNervosa,fmt8ps2,t1_fmt89m0,1586368657.0,damn you really got me there
AnorexiaNervosa,fmt5nj8,t3_fxap9p,1586367255.0,"Yeah same.  As a kid I remember my friends playing wii fit and it would always tell you your bmi.  I always had like a good BMI, but because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúunderweight‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt having it.  Literally as a first grader I had body issues and can still look at pictures of myself as a kid and see how my stomach poked out.  

I remember at Christmas this year my cousin told me that when I was like six I told her I didn‚Äôt like the way my stomach looked.  I don‚Äôt remember saying it but I do remember trying to suck in 100% of the time"
AskGirls,fmsu88a,t3_fx261w,1586362086.0,no.  they‚Äôll only make fun of you if you‚Äôre an asshole
AskGirls,fmstr1n,t3_fx4485,1586361872.0,"It really depends on the context and how good of friends we are.  If you‚Äôre a dude and you just call women bitches A LOT and for fun/a joke, it probably wouldn‚Äôt come off too great, in fact I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd like it at all.  I‚Äôd say moderate how often you use it.  Like literally your sentence ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a few bitches....‚Äù yeah no just call them women it makes you look trashy and like you don‚Äôt care that much about women.  If you‚Äôre not making an explicit joke then try not to call girls bitches.  It ain‚Äôt cute

But on the flip side if you‚Äôre talking about someone who really is a nasty bitch I‚Äôd say you have every right to say it."
