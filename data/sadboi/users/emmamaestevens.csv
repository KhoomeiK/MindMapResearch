BPD,feej60r,t3_eop9j8,1579034820.0,"People say you only have a diagnose if a doctor diagnoses you, but I disagree. I think it’s to shoo away people who glorify mental illness or hypochondriacs. You’re different, you clearly understand from a logical perspective that you have the disease. They’re going to diagnose you based on the 9 diagnostic criteria for BPD in the DSM-5, and you can Google it. You need 5 to have BPD. If you have 5 of those things- and no one really knows that but you, if you truly understand what it means, which it seems like you do- then you have borderline personality disorder.

That won’t change a lot in terms of the medical benefits of having a diagnosis, but I hope for your self-esteem knowing your diagnosis despite if the doctors don’t diagnose you- which doctors often don’t because of the stigma around BPD!  

Good luck!"

BPD,fd019wk,t3_ejq341,1578112132.0,"I don't think it's appropriate to talk about exes with your current partner, especially if it's upsetting you. And I think there is a healthy balance for sharing how you're feeling and it sounds like you're having trouble finding that. Maybe now that you've tried the other extreme, you can slowly introduce self-expression and venting back into your relationship. Because keeping your mouth shut all the time is definitely bad for mental health and your relationship. I don't think asking, ""I feel uncomfortable when you talk about your exes, can we please leave that off the table unless it's absolutely necessary?"" is an unreasonable request. In fact, I think you're totally in the right to be uncomfortable, to a degree. Don't let it rack you're brain, stay strong, stay rational. He's with you because you're the one he chose to be with. But he doesn't need to bring up his exes all the time. That's just gratuitous."
BPD,fd007ke,t3_ejqjjf,1578111652.0,"No one can actually decide if you're borderline except yourself, as far as I'm concerned. But I'll give you my two cents. I feel very strongly that borderline is my exact diagnosis and I am the same way- I'm not manipulative, I don't split and I don't have violent outbursts. 

If you haven't already, I would suggest looking up the DSM-5 criteria for BPD. There are 9 criteria and you only have to have 5 to be considered borderline. Because of that, borderline can look really different for different people. There are a lot of negative connotations with borderline that I think you might be associating borderline with. You can be borderline and have good relationships and many people I've met on this forum are kind, loving people. 

Personally, some of the things you describe sound like borderline to me, and I say that mostly because they sound like things I do myself I know are parts of my BPD. Being overwhelmed with emotion and running to the woods, desperately needed validation from others, sounds to me like a part of borderline. I describe my moments of overwhelming emotion as ""episodes"" as well, and I think that's a key part of borderline, that our emotions are extreme but only for a short amount of time. It's not like bipolar where it lasts for weeks, for borderline an ""episode"" of extreme emotion can last minutes to hours. 

Please don't cut. I know it's tempting. But I've been cutting since I was 12 and it's the stupidest thing I've ever done. You don't have to cut to have borderline. Self-injury is only one of 9 criteria for borderline. 

Here's the important thing: whether or not you're borderline isn't that important in the long run. The benefits of the diagnosis I've found are being part of a community of people going through the same thing and being in treatment specific to BPD. You can still do DBT treatment without being officially ""borderline,"" and I suggest it. DBT is really helpful for controlling extreme emotions like you describe. As for being part of the community, here you are! I hope you can find some comfort in this forum, whatever you decide your diagnosis is."

The best thing to do is to listen. There's no need for unsolicited advice of anything like that. But it's also okay to remind your friend after a conversation like that, every once in a while, ""Hey, just so you know, I'm here if you ever need anything."" 

I imagine it can be hard to listen to two people joke about something so serious, but as someone with mental illness, that experience is *so* cathartic. They have to trust you already if they're letting you be a part of that! Anyway, I'm going on and on a little bit, I just want to reiterate that I think you're on the right track.

I thought because he had a ""personality disorder"" he was a bad person. Turns out, he was just a bad person. It took me getting diagnosed with BPD to realize this. However, when I was first diagnosed, I absolutely lost my shit in the mental hospital fighting this diagnosis. Then they gave me the literature and it's like- oh shit, that's me. And you learn that 1) there are 256 ways to have this disease based on having at least 5/9 criteria, so it's unlikely any two borderline people you meet have the same symptoms and 2) it's just a disordered way of thinking, it doesn't reflect on your innate goodness. You can have diabetes and be a bad person but diabetes doesn't make you a bad person, you know? There's so much stigma about this disease and honestly, I think it stems from the title of the disorder and it's history of being a throwaway/lost cause diagnosis. 

Anyway, stay strong and try not to let the judgement of others hurt you. I don't think most people even know what borderline is. And if you ever met someone who mattered, they wouldn't care that you had BPD. People might have stigmas even, but if they're good people, they can change."

mentalhealth,ewld2m6,t3_cor9wl,1565518075.0,"Until it gets severe, I usually only see my anxiety and depression symptoms when I’m idle. I go to work, run errands, hang out with friends. I’m happy. Then I go home and I’m alone with nothing but my thoughts and miserable. That, and being tired can be a blow to your mood if you’ve already been working overtime without knowing. I recommend looking into meds/therapy because in my experience these things rarely resolve themselves. Hope you find some relief."
