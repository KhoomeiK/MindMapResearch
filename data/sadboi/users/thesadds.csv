depressed,ep2zsyz,t3_btucsq,1559014947.0,"I hate my job too dude, they hired me as a bagger and all they have me do is be the janitor. There is lots of awesome people that work where I do but I never get to talk to them because im always cleaning. My boss always hires new cashiers even though he knows I want to be one so bad, I’m already trained for it and everything all he has to do is make the change and hire a janitor instead of using me. My friends who got hired at the same time all got promoted. And on top of all that a girl who worked there asked me out and we had 2 “dates” and after the second she said she wasn’t looking for a romantic relationship and she got back with her ex a week later. Sorry for the rant but god damn I feel your pain."
