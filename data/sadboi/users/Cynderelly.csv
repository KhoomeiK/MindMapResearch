For Christmas this year, his brother bought him a picture of meme man and framed it. 

The way my boyfriend trolls me is a lot sweeter. One time, there was ice all over my car windshield and doors. It was so bad that I couldn't open my doors.. I work early in the morning, and before he woke up (I thought), I texted him complaining that I'd have to call into work because I can't open my stupid car doors. About half an hour-45 minutes later, he texted me saying ""good morning! Are you sure your car doors are frozen shut? You should go check again"" so I did.

Not only did he scrape the ice off of all my windows and somehow manage to open the passenger door, he'd put a thermos full of coffee in the cup holder.

When I texted him, gushing about how sweet he is, he insisted ""I have no idea what you're talking about"".

Then in 7th grade, after my spine was fused and I looked ""normal"", suddenly I had more friends and boys liked me lol. This actually isn't even something I realized until I was already an adult. 

I got incredibly lucky. My cousin also had to have his spine fused but went to a different surgeon, and shortly after his procedure he had to have another one to fix a pinched nerve that was hurting so much he'd scream until he was too worn out to keep screaming. 

My surgeon was so good, people have asked me before if I'm a ballerina or some other sort of dancer because of my ""perfect posture""

ETA: every doctor I've ever seen who has seen my back (and the huge scar) has said something along the lines of ""oh, you had your spine fused? Wow... I couldn't even tell..."" which tbh made me wonder if they look at medical history as much as they should lol.

I understand wanting to protect your friends, but you can't control them and prevent them from making stupid decisions. You can only be very vocal to them about how you feel and then hope it'll sink in, knowing that it probably won't.

relationships,fq0gz9u,t1_fpzwhzt,1589031719.0,"I'd be concerned by the phrasing ""the best part is that you give off no red flags"". I mean she's being stalked so it's understandable that she feels this way, but that phrasing sounds like she's mentally stuck on her ex boyfriend and how crazy he's acting.

alcohol,fq0amzy,t1_fpybpw8,1589029461.0,Damn :( hopefully you can reschedule
relationships,fpyeg40,t1_fpy3dw3,1589002471.0,This is really important OP. Does this happen often? Has it happened in the past?
