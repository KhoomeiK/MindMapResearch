psychotherapy,fpv6yem,t1_fpv18cg,1588936995.0,"Ye I think the profession can be quite a bit harder for introverts. I am incredibly extroverted, so for me I don't feel drained by my sessions, rather I feel quite energised. Even during isolation, whilst many people are struggling with it, the reason I think I have been coping so well is that having sessions with my clients over zoom has meant I haven't felt at all isolated during this time. Having this constant contact with my clients really brings me up. So I imagine for someone who is naturally more introverted, this will probably be a bit harder to deal with. 

Therapy was essential for me to deal with my compassion fatigue, particularly with a focus on DBT and schema therapy. Exploring/identifying my maladaptive schemas ie unrelenting standards/perfectionism and how it was affecting my work was really important, and being OK with the middle road rather than being caught up in the extremes/dialectics of my perfectionism was helpful. 

A really big part of it for me was the gradual realisation that as a psychologist, I only actually have a small influence on my clients life, especially when you take into account the bigger picture and everything else that impacts on the clients life. I initially assumed way too much responsibility for my clients outcomes and if one had some kind of setback, I would immediately blame myself entirely and tied my worth as a psychologist to this. I placed a lot of pressure on myself to expect complete 180s from my clients even though I only spend an hour a week/fortnight with them. We can't account for what our clients do for the other 167 hours per week. When my therapist helped me to accept this, it was really liberating for me. I can only be responsible for what I do in the single hour each week I have with the client. The rest is completely out of my control. This realisation helped me immensely and lifted a lot of my compassion fatigue"
psychotherapy,fpk34by,t1_fpju9xu,1588687019.0,"I second the active coping. 

My first 6 months was tough, I had symptoms of compassion fatigue and I had some work absences as a result. It motivated me to start learning salsa dancing. I then started attending social dancing in addition to my classes every week, where I now dance 3 nights a week. I can't tell you how essential it has been for my maintenance of well being. It's physical activity which is always good for well being, but the skill also uses a completely different part of the brain to when I am work. When I'm dancing, I'm in a state of flow and I'm able to completely disconnect from work. It is also social, and it is nice to have easy and friendly conversation with people after an entire day of just listening and helping others. I would have totally burned out in my first year and possibly risked dropped out of the profession if I didn't find this as an outlet. It helped me immensely. 

I'm now 18 months in, and I feel like I have a really good balance. It is a huge learning curve working out how to maintain your own well being when you are responsible for others."
therapy,fpjq18n,t3_gdtht9,1588677520.0,"I feel that I could have written this myself.

The solution for me was therapy. My first therapist was an amazing woman who did extensive re-parenting with me. She became a kind of model of a parent, someone who responded to my emotional needs in a way neither of my parents were able to. Gradually over time, I learned to trust that there are adults in the world who will validate me and care about me. This took around 5 years or so in therapy to get to the point where I felt I had largely processed the trauma. 

A big part of my healing was also forming a stable and healthy romantic relationship. So much of my childhood trauma was played out in my relationships which for a long time were codependent and lacking trust. Finally when I met my husband, he became another model of a very stable and responsive person who I could trust.

I think a combination of a terrific therapist and an emotionally stable partner were the things that really healed me."

AskEurope,fp3p8e3,t1_fp2oy2h,1588283317.0,"In my experience, the Balkan identity is not something people generally identify with as strongly with over here as they do the Eastern European catch all. I think so much of that has to do with with growing up outside of the direct influence of Europe, and instead being influenced by parents/grandparents more outdated ideas of European identity. Hungary and Romania would definitely be considered Eastern European, due to the iron curtain divide like you already explained.

Greece is another thing all together. In Australia we have another kind of identity that evolved during the mass European migrations of the 50s and 60s, called 'wogs'. This used to be a derogatory label given to anyone from southern/Mediterranean Europe ie Italians, ex-yugos, Greeks, Turkish, Lebanese, Cypriots, Maltese, Spanish and generally most Middle Easterns.  Over time, particularly in the 80s and 90s, the wog label evolved as something to be proud of. But this Southern European/Mediterranean identity is something that people identify with much more strongly over here than the Balkan identity. I think this is because of the unifying experience of moving to Australia via boat at a similar time, with barely 2 cents in their pocket, generally without much education, and they generally worked on farms or factories so tended to have a lot of interaction with each other."

There is a 'click', you feel instantly understood, you don't feel like you need to explain things at length, there's almost a feeling of them being able to read your thoughts and interpret them better than you can. For me it's somewhat intangible, just like chemistry with any other person. A genuine belief in their ability to be able to help me is paramount for me returning. Them having the confidence to tell me that they will be able to help me also has an incredibly positive effect in getting me to commit to therapy and to return. 

What's made me run for the door.... Not having the above feelings. I personally also find it unhelpful when a therapist just sits there in silence and waits me to guide the entire conversation. I understand that approach can have utility and some may prefer that, but I can't stand it. I love it when my therapist talks more, the more they talk, the more I can learn from them. I have viewed all my therapists as teachers, teachers can't be that effective just being silent at the front of the class, there needs to be some instruction and guidance for it to be worth my time and money.

Rather than searching for a schema therapist, it might be more fruitful to search for a therapist that appears to have good reviews, and then enquire with them whether they are trained in schema therapy. Sorry I can't be of more help with that.

Please just remember that you're on a journey. As humans we are a work in progress until the day we die. Therapy can't resolve every single one of your difficulties. I have been in therapy on and off for 10 years myself. In my experience, therapy was really useful at particular times in my life, and other times I needed to just live my life. I learned so much in therapy and in many ways it was life changing. If anything, I had an over reliance on therapy for a while, it became my crux. But I also needed to just let life take its course as well and just experience it, and grow from the things that it threw me. Each romantic relationship I have been in healed me in ways that therapy never could. Going through grief, travelling, working in different jobs, studying, navigating challenging friendships, those things were learning experiences that changed me and helped to alleviate a lot of my former difficulties. So much of your growth and change will come from just experiencing life outside of therapy. And given how young you are, there are so many opportunities that are out there waiting for you. I know in the really distressing and difficult times you just want all the pain to stop. Things will get easier as you develop the skills to cope, are able to process your past and also as time goes on. Good luck!"
therapy,foj0tib,t1_foix0b6,1587803908.0,"There is a vast evidence base behind therapies like psychoanalysis and schema therapy. The reason that CBT is considered the gold standard therapeutic approach is because it has been the most researched therapy in the world. However, that doesn't mean other therapies are less effective, they just haven't had as many RCTs done as CBT. I understand if you prefer a more structured approach, that is a personal preference and it needs to suit you. However, schema therapy can be quite structured when compared to psychoanalysis, so I think it still might be worth looking into. 

Below is a literature review done by the APS which summarises the evidence base for different disorders. Have you been given a particular diagnosis according to the DSM? Without one, it's a bit more difficult to ascertain which research base is going to be most relevant to your situation (the review is based on DSM diagnoses). However, the document is at least a starting point for you to have a read of the relevant research behind the different therapies

https://www.psychology.org.au/About-Us/What-we-do/advocacy/Position-Papers-Discussion-Papers-and-Reviews/psychological-interventions-mental-disorders

Also, pretty much any therapy can be considered to fall under CBT for Medicare purposes. If you are discussing your cognitions and behaviours with the therapist, it technically falls under CBT. CBT is a very wide umbrella term that pretty much all other therapies fall under. Also, more effective therapists tend to integrate different therapies together to best fit their clients. It's incredibly rare that you'll find a therapist that does only strict psychoanalysis or ACT etc. So even if you decide to do a different therapy like psychoanalysis, there's a very high chance that the therapist will also incorporate some CBT approaches as well. So in terms of Medicare, your therapist will be able to 'massage' the approach so that the treatment can still be subsidised. Every psychologist I know who works under a MHCP works like this. 

Another thing to note: research shows that the therapy modality actually accounts for only 1% of treatment outcomes. Also, overall there is little difference in the effectiveness of the different treatment modalities. What is more important is the relationship with the therapist, how good they are at developing trust with clients, and the quality of the therapeutic alliance. If you are interested, look up Scott Miller, he has reviewed a lot of the research into treatment effects, you may find it intriguing to read his stuff. It's just another perspective: perhaps you just didn't quite 'click' with your previous therapists? Finding the right therapist is like finding 'the one' in a romantic relationship. You either have a great chemistry or you don't. If you don't have that 'click', then no amount of training or specialisation will help that therapist to influence better treatment outcomes for you

therapy,foip0gh,t1_foibzrq,1587792523.0,"Thanks for clarifying that. I think you've done really well with your efforts so far. Please keep persisting. Your life and wellbeing is worth the effort to keep working on developing skills that will ultimately help you. It sounds like you are young (gathering that you are a uni student) and you have already committed yourself to therapy and improving yourself. I think it's awesome that you already have the self awareness to seek help and try different things when you can see something perhaps isn't helping you reach your therapeutic goals. It's a strength, harness it! 

In my professional opinion, it sounds like there could be unresolved traumas/childhood experiences that may have contributed to your perfectionism which is causing daily anxiety for you. In my opinion, CBT and ACT are about fixing the present, not the past. They are not modalities that are focused on delving into the past to understand WHY you behave/think in a particular way. In my opinion, they are like band aid solutions, they aim to reduce distress and anxiety symptoms in the present, but they do little to resolve past trauma. I agree with one of the other suggestions here, psychoanalysis could be more helpful to get an understanding of your past. Some elements of schema therapy could work as well. If there is a specific unresolved traumatic event, then something like EMDR could help.

As a starting point, I suggest reading Reinventing Your Life by Young. It is an incredibly insightful book in helping to identify whether there is a schema that has developed as your filter for viewing the world. The book also explains how these kinds of schemas develop. I suggest reading the chapter on Unrelenting Standards, which is the same as perfectionism. 

I say all this also from personal experience. I relate to a lot of what you said about perfectionism, so it could be helpful for as well to understand your past from this perspective. Unrelenting Standards is one of my core schemas. I personally wasn't able to effectively manage my anxiety and regulate my emotions until I had a good understanding of WHY I had developed in that way, and then I worked on resolving the traumas that contributed to my perfectionistic schema. Even just having greater awareness of how my past was contributing to my present helped me to become a bit more conscious in the present moment of thinking or behaving in ways that were more adaptive or helpful. It helped me to be more mindful in the present that my automatic thoughts and behaviours had developed because of events that happened deep in my past, and were in large part unrelated to what was actually happening to me in the present.

therapy,fjcrxum,t3_fckgkk,1583234214.0,"Although not everyone experiences outright abuse in childhood, no child has the perfect upbringing, even if it seems like it from the outside. As a psychologist, I can attest to the fact that even the most well adjusted people carry some scars from their childhood that need to be healed as adults. In my experience, no one has a perfect childhood. 

I don't say this to invalidate your experience. It sounds like things were really tough for you growing up. You have every right to feel that so let down by something you had no control over. However, I guarantee that your friends with seemingly perfect upbringings still had some issues to resolve as they became adults.

Myself, I have had borderline tendencies my whole adult life. I had a seemingly 'good' upbringing, in that my parents did not divorce, I had a roof over my head, and they loved me. But I still developed traits of a personality disorder that commonly develops out of an abusive childhood. Daily life is often a struggle for me. Emotions feel like razorblades cutting through sunburned skin. I have the need to control things in my life to the point of manipulation. People describe being in a relationship with me as 'walking on eggshells'. It's not easy. And I had what many outsiders would consider a good childhood. My traits developed from small dysfunctional nuances in my parents relationship that ultimately had some pretty dysfunctional effects on me that I didn't quite understand until well until adulthood. From the outside, most people in my life assumed I was 'fine', including my parents. 

I'm just sharing this as it may give you a different perspective when you compare your life to your friends. You don't always know what happens behind closed doors. Your friends may be suffering in a far more subtle way. Everyone has some scars that need healing."
psychotherapy,fj4yb4l,t3_fbe7d6,1583019819.0,"Fellow Aussie prov psych here. It's really great that you've taken the steps to start healing and have committed yourself to therapy! My own trauma has manifested itself in a similar way to yours, however the cause seems a bit different. You can absolutely be an effective psychologist, as long as you continue to practice within your level of competency. It's good that you have already identified that (at least for now) you may need to refer on any clients that need trauma work, until you have a) completed sufficient training and b) you have lowered your own risk of being retriggered. 

Reading one of your comments, you mention you are currently focusing on EFT. The fact that your therapist has started firstly on doing emotional regulation with you is the first step in trauma therapy - stabilisation. She is possibly already gearing you for the next step. Only once you are stabilised can you start to delve deeper into trauma. Schema therapy can be really helpful for this, as it ties in psychodynamic therapy with cognitive therapy. I am currently doing schema therapy myself, and it's been very eye opening. I suggest reading the book Reinventing Your Life by Young to give you an overview of what's involved.

The fact of the matter is that most of your clients will present with some sort of past trauma which has manifested itself in dysfunctional thoughts and behaviours that impact on their present. It's why people go to therapy. To be honest, I think you will find your scope of work very limited in the future if you intend to avoid doing any type of trauma therapy with clients. If you envision doing therapy and not just assessment in your work, then you'll probably need to start processing your own trauma in order to eventually be competent to deliver trauma based interventions in the future. You can become adept at delivering strict CBT which only focuses on what is going on moment to moment for a client, but that only works as a stabilisation technique, and doesn't do anything to heal clients' past traumas. It's like a ""band-aid"" technique.

It takes time to heal from past traumas. It also takes time to become an effective therapist. I am of the belief that as therapists, we can't teach what we don't know. I personally think it is ESSENTIAL for all therapists to have their own therapy (I don't actually understand why this isn't compulsory during our training in Australia), to make us more self aware, and also so we can better empathise with our clients sitting in the chair across from us. You've done really well to be able to identify what you can and can't do at the moment in terms of delivering interventions. But I encourage you to delve into your trauma, rather than avoid it. As therapists, we should strive to be models for being authentic and effective. Most of our clients dysfunctional behaviours comes from repeated experiential avoidance, and if we want to model effective behaviour to our clients, experiential avoidance probaby shouldn't be our go-to response when  something is difficult.

Best of luck in your journey :) happy to answer any questions if you want to DM me"

Also have a look at photos in magazines etc and see how celebs pose. As much as I don't want to encourage celebrity worship, they have body poses nailed. Try a few different ones in front of the mirror and see what is most flattering for you. 

Also, I find the most helpful thing is to look at a bunch of different photos of yourself. Compare the ones where you think you look better with the ones that are less flattering. What is it that makes the difference? Is it the way you're smiling (teeth VS no teeth), the way your head is tilted, do you look better looking towards the right or left, have you squinted your eyes too much, the way your hair is styled etc. There's so many variables. 

The kind of clothes you are wearing can make a difference too. Some clothes photograph better than others (depending on the person obviously). Ie big wide brim hats look can look great, but they often don't photograph well in daylight as it casts a huge shadow and makes your head look much darker than the rest of your body. Closed toe shoes that cut off sharply at your ankle can make your legs look stumpy if wearing something short, so shoes that show more of the foot can make the legs look a bit more elongated.

sydney,fgwwrd2,t1_fgvag78,1581166676.0,"Agreed. Sydney born and bred. I used to moan and complain about it until I lived in London. Gave me a very different perspective. I moved back to Sydney a year ago and I'm the happiest I've ever been living here.

Sydney is an amazing city and I feel very fortunate to have been born here and to have the freedom to live here. Like other people have said on this thread, there's a reason it's the most most visited city in Australia and so many foreigners want to move here.

You create the life you want regardless of the city you are in. You can be happy anywhere. If there's things in your life in Sydney that you are dissatisfied with, then that's up to you to change it.

Congestion? Move somewhere where you can walk or cycle to work. I live in inner Sydney, I don't own a car, I live in a place with rent that is (by Sydney standards) very reasonable, and I walk everywhere I need to get to. The money I save on not running a car, I can put towards the slightly higher rent that comes with living in inner Sydney. I never deal with the stress of having to sit in traffic. It's a lifestyle choice that you make. You can't blame that all on Sydney. 

Bad value? Most big cities in the world are expensive. You can move to a cheaper (which will definitely mean smaller) city but there's a pay off - less job options, potentially higher transport costs to get to jobs that are possibly located further away, lower salary. It's a balance. 

Sense of isolation? Create the community you want. I used to bitch and complain that Sydney didn't offer the kind of communities and social life that I wanted. After then moving to London and being forced to create a completely new life from scratch, I realised that I was just lazy in Sydney, and didn't put in anywhere the same amount of effort I did into creating a sense of community for myself in London. Moving back to Sydney, I now put in a lot more effort and I have created an incredibly rich, vibrant, fulfilling and connected community for myself. It wasn't Sydney's fault. It was my own."

CityPorn,fgucxnu,t1_fgu48tl,1581117777.0,"I'm from Sydney, and to be honest the only time I have experienced the so called rivalry is when people from Brisbane or Melbourne visit Sydney and talk shit about how much they hate Sydney, or when I visit either Melbourne or Brisbane and the locals say ""Brisbane/Melbourne is so much better than Sydney isn't it?"". Almost all the Sydneysiders I know love Melbourne and really enjoy visiting it. Brisbane is less visited, but same deal, most of the Sydneysiders I know like Brisbane and think it is a nice city. Whenever I have friends from Melbourne or Brisbane visit me in Sydney, I never go on about how I think I live in a more superior city, and yet for some reason I'm expected to cop slack when I visit either of those cities just because I'm from Sydney. It's tiresome and pointless. 

That's just been my own personal experience, and I don't speak on behalf of every single Sydneysider. 

All the cities are different and have their own unique culture and vibe. Rather than making baseless comparisons, why can't everyone just value the good things that each city has?"
AttachmentParenting,fgo1qov,t1_fgnxjkj,1580957769.0,"It's true that being close in age doesn't necessarily mean you will have a close relationship. But being closer in age will make it more likely, given that you are more likely to have things in common due to being similar developmentally. 

I have 2 brothers, one is 1.5 years younger than me, and the other is 8 years younger. The brother who is closer to my age did everything with me when I was younger, it was easy for my parents to get us to do activities together given we were at similar stages developmentally and as such enjoyed similar activities. We were pretty close as kids and have grown to be very close as adults. However with my other brother, apart from being a kind of baby sitter for him sometimes, I didn't really build a close connection as we were just at such different stages developmentally. When I entered my tumultuous teen years, I was even less interested in creating a bond with a kid. I then moved out of home so by the time my brother was at a more similar maturity to me, I wasn't around much. We have only just started to properly connect over the past couple of years, now that we are both adults and finally have similar interests and can go out to the same places. 

There are no guarantees that having children closer in age will make them automatically close. But having them further apart in age definitely creates some challenges with fostering a relationship"

I know what I'm about to say is anecdotal evidence, but every female I know who uses online dating apps has stated that they feel it favours men more than women. Men are (generally speaking) wired to be able to separate sex and emotions WAY more easily than females. It means that apps like tinder make it an uneven playing field when (generally speaking) women get emotionally attached very quickly after sex. It means that for any guys on there who are using it merely as a means of just having fun and not looking for a relationship, it's SO EASY for them to immediately arrange casual sex (rather than the 'traditional' way of meeting someone at a bar, tuning them all night and then hoping to take them home at the end of the night). With dating apps, at any mere mention of 'not interested', a male literally has at his fingertips hundreds of other women that he can contact immediately. He can attempt to tune dozens of women in an evening, all without even having to leave his home! 

I'm highlighting this as I think dating can be hard for both men and women. Complaining that online dating is skewed one way or another is just another excuse. In reality both men and women experience unique difficulties due to their sex differences."
dating_advice,ff2egui,t1_fezyh41,1579502783.0,"It annoys me immensely when single people say that 'online dating isn't my style' or 'online dating doesn't work'.

I met my now husband online. There were loads of nice people I met through online dating before I met my husband. There are loads of people on there JUST LIKE YOU who are wanting companionship and commitment and don't want to fuck around. Overall it was a fairly pleasant experience for me (as far as dating can be enjoyable.....overall dating wasn't amazing fun for me and I'm glad I don't have to do it any more). Sure there were some arseholes online , but I met just as many arseholes meeting them 'organically' through friends or shared interests. 

For a single person that says 'online dating doesn't work'.... Well ye, of course you would say that. You wouldn't say that something 'works' until you're in a long term committed relationship or married right?? It's equally correct to say 'meeting someone organically doesn't work' if you are not in a long term relationship or married.

The comments were more out of genuine interest and happiness for me, rather than jealousy or disdain. The comments have all been made by clients of a similar demographic ie middle class women over the age of 50 that all have daughters. As such, I assume the fact that I am at a similar lifestage to their children generates their interest in this. I guess if you had something similar happen to you, you would need to use your judgement as to whether you feel it is worth exploring with them in a subsequent session. Personally I didn't think this was relevant for me given my clients' presentation and context. 

Both my supervisors wear their rings at work and have never suggested to me that I don't wear mine. I think it entirely depends on whether you prefer to adopt an entirely blank slate approach. I don't generally make a habit of self disclosing unless I think it's beneficial to the relationship, or unless they specifically ask me a question.

dating_advice,fd2obzr,t3_ejsx5q,1578150064.0,"The people who you have known for a while who you become attracted to were once strangers as well. That sense of familiarity and emotional connection develops over time. Your friends were all strangers to you at one point. You're losing out if you are going into dates with strangers with the expectation that there will be an instant spark.

I met my husband via a dating app. So many other people I know have met their significant other through dating apps. It can work. Perhaps you just need to manage your expectations better? View dates with strangers as opportunities to learn more about yourself and what you like (and don't like), have fun, and potentially make a new friend. Developing an attraction is an added bonus, not the main goal. 

It also pays to be patient. It took a good 3 months for me to develop a solid connection with my now husband. It was a really slow burn initially, but it paid off in the end. I eventually had a moment of clarity where I could clearly see how compatible we were and that there was very solid foundations for a strong relationship, I then became even more attracted to him. Attraction is not always instant. Don't be fooled by movies where people meet their soul mates and 'just know' immediately that they are destined to live life together forever.

dating_advice,fbho29a,t3_edb021,1576878271.0,"In a world that has a population of 7.5 billion people, there are guaranteed LOADS of people on this planet that you would be compatible with. The concept of ""dream man"" or ""the one"" is a total illogical fallacy in a world full of that many people. Dating is a numbers game, pure and simple. Meet as many people as you can, and you will increase your chances of meeting the ones you are more compatible with.

You've put this guy on a pedestal and say that he's the one who got away, but how good was he really if he didn't even love you? To me, this suggests you need to work a bit on your self concept. Everyone deserves to be in a relationship where your love is reciprocated, and yet you still label your ex as the one who got away.... To me, that's absurd. From my own past experiences when I was younger, I've learned that the one that got away is a total fallacy. The one who got away will continue to have that label until you meet someone a bit more compatible who you have a somewhat healthier and happier relationship with. Then when you break up with that person, THEY become the one who got away, and so on and so forth. Stop with the labelling, or recognise it for what it is - it's just a label! ""The one who got away"" is just a label that you have assigned to this person. He was a flawed human (just like every other human) who didn't love you. That's another more accurate label. 

It also sounds like you might be trying to tick boxes, which is dangerous. NO ONE will tick every single box. The only boxes that should matter are ""do I love this person"", ""is my love reciprocated"", ""do we make each other better people"" and ""on any given day, is our relationship about an 80 out of 100"" (because NO relationship is ever going to be 100 out of 100 all the time. I think 80 out of 100 is a pretty decent compromise given that every human is imperfect). 

Further to this, if you are focused on what was and what could have been with your ex, you are doing a disservice to every other person you have dated since then. They've got no chance when it sounds like you are trying to recreate what you had with your ex. Any person you have dated since then has been doomed. That's not fair on them or on you.

I don't mean to come across as harsh, and I'm sorry if anything my comment offends you at all. But it sounds like you want to move forwards, and some hard truths are normally good for this"

Etosha is incredible, it offers the best safari experience in Africa by far, we camped at Okaukuejo and Halali. It is a mistake to camp outside of the national park as you miss out on viewing the waterholes at night which are action packed. You can literally spend all evening with a glass of wine watching the spectacle from your campsite. None of the other famous national parks in Africa offer this up close experience at night, instead you need to book a night game drive. Etosha is also very good value cost wise when you compare it to places like Serengeti/Ngorongoro Crater. 

Sossusvlei/Dune 45/Deadvlei is stunning and not to be missed. The Skeleton Coast is very eerie. Camping underneath the looming Spitzkoppe was a special experience. The Kamanjab area offers a chance to visit the Himba who are fascinating and very fun to meet. We also visited a cheetah sanctuary in this area which was a really special experience.

Part of the unique experience of visiting this country is that it is the second least densly populated county in the world. It means you can drive for hours without seeing a soul. Driving to Solitaire or stopping at Rostock Ritz offers a glimpse into a very solitary life.

Luderitz, Epupa Falls, Fish River Canyon and kayaking along the Orange River are still on my to do list.
