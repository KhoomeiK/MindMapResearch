NarutoFanfiction,fehmwmc,t3_ep1xvq,1579119783.0,"As a fic writer (and someone who wrote a nart fic), here are my tips
-characterization. Make sure the characters act like how they actually do. Making them act in a way so different from how they’re written can turn readers off
-don’t put pressure on yourself. Write when you feel like it. Sometimes, you can make yourself not want to write when you put all these expectations on yourself 
-try to ignore purposely rude comments, but listen to criticism. It will only make you better
-spellcheck and grammar"

Don’t forget the bleeding all over your nice underwear and bedsheets :)))) but yes, having a period is so *privileged* ugH you got us!!!!!!!! Anyone that has one can tell you it’s hell and the fact these people claim that it makes you privileged is so insane and lacking in empathy.
