BeautyGuruChatter,foeeh0o,t3_g71jjj,1587701804.0,"(TW: sexual assault, child sexual abuse) Jeffree Star will be going live on Chris Hansen’s YouTube channel- Have a Seat With Chris Hansen- on Sunday to discuss the allegation against Dahvie Vanity. Most of you probably already know the situation by now, but for those who don’t: Dahvie Vanity is lead singer of a band called Blood on the Dance Floor who gained popularity during the MySpace era. The large majority of their fans were (and still are) teens and preteens, and Vanity allegedly used this as an opportunity to groom, sexually assault and rape numerous girls, a majority of whom who underage. After touring with Blood on the Dance Floor for some time, Jeffree Star tweeted that he had seen Dahvie Vanity with an underaged girl, calling him a “childfucker” and stating he regretted working with him. Later on, these tweets were deleted and Jeffree once again started working with and touring with Blood on the Dance Floor, giving zero explanation. This has come back into the spotlight lately as result of Chris Hansen’s videos interviewing Vanity’s (alleged) victims. Jeffree Star has done many things that have angered me but this one has been the most infuriating to me over the years. I honestly don’t think anything he can say at this point can redeem him, but I’m going to watch the video anyways to see how the hell he attempts to explain himself. Hopefully he chooses to do what he can to make a difference now by speaking truthfully and bringing to light some of Vanity’s crimes."

The reason many of us choose to use weed for medical reasons is because it is not chemically addictive; I chose to treat my panic attacks with THC instead of with Xanax (which has been prescribed to me in the past and offered to me by my current psychiatrist) because I know the addictive potential of Xanax and I have watched it tear apart a friend’s life. Additionally, two of my closest friends’ fathers are recovering addicts and both now use marijuana to treat their pain instead of the pain pills which they were originally prescribed and became addicted to.

Weed is not. Frankly I find this post kind of offensive and incredibly ignorant, and I think almost anyone who has an actual addiction and been through treatment would agree. 

Edit: I am also tired of weed themed makeup and against it for my own reasons (I think it’s ethically wrong to make money off of this while tens of thousands of people are incarcerated for it and none of the profits are being donated to help their cause), but the comparison of marijuana to chemically addictive, life-ruining substances is harmful and offensive."

It was a thoroughly awful experience and I imagine it seemed like a huge waste of money to my parents. I quit halfway through the year and never looked back. If Boy Scouts had been open to girls when I was a kid I think I would’ve had a far better time there and learned some actual useful skills instead of basically how to be a 1950’s housewife.

Edit: in this case though I think this person’s symptoms are actually way more fitting of Borderline Personality Disorder, which is commonly misdiagnosed as Bipolar. BPD people do actually have mood swings triggered by the tiniest things because the parts of the brain responsible for emotional regulation are physically smaller, making people with BPD capable of acting irrationally and having extreme emotional outbursts at seemingly tiny things. BPD is treatable though, I myself have it and go to talk therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy every week as well as take medication to keep my symptoms in check pretty much so that I don’t end up like the girl in this post. I have become a much more rational person and much more capable of handling my emotions to the point that most of my symptoms are barely noticeable anymore. People with BPD are not evil as many like to make us out, but if the disorder goes unchecked and untreated it does have the potential to make someone act toxic and manipulative, as I believe could possibly be the case with this girl."

Its a good way to do it if you don’t have a good surface to roll on and don’t want to spill any weed. I also find the joint doesn’t canoe nearly as bad when it’s an even width throughout."

relationship_advice,fm1lqcs,t1_fm16ykr,1585680712.0,"What an awful, sociopathic thing to say. I agree that this girl sounds like a toxic mess and no one should ever sacrifice their mental health or happiness for their partner, but to say you should never date a girl who’s been raped or has a mental illness? That’s fucking awful. Horrific. Mentally ill people and rape victims are just as capable and deserving of love as anyone else is. A person having experienced trauma and hardship does not make them a worthless piece of trash unable to be loved by anyone. Congrats, you win the award for Worst Thing I’ve Seen in Reddit in Months."
relationship_advice,fm1l3h8,t1_fm0u7iv,1585680385.0,"Yeah, I was hesitant to say this at first because I feel awful questioning someone’s trauma, but I have to go with my gut and my prior experience here and say I think she might be lying about being raped. It took me 10 years to admit to myself that I had been sexually abused, and another 2 (as well as quite a few drinks) for me to say it out loud for the first time ever. Of course, their are some victims who don’t have this same reaction and are able to speak freely about their trauma, but to be able to describe it in graphic detail and constantly repeat those details voluntarily? I can’t imagine myself or anyone else I know who’s been sexually abused or raped being able to do that. Even more so, the use of her trauma as a guilt tripping/sympathy-gaining tactic to make your problems seem lesser; that’s awful toxic behavior and not how someone who’s genuinely traumatized acts. To be honest, her behavior really reminds me of a girl who lied to me about being raped- she constantly brought up the “rape” at times when other people were trying to vent about their issues, and would describe it in graphic detail in a way that was intensely triggering to me because of my experience. She was able to describe it in so much detail without shedding a tear or letting out a single shaky breath. I went against my gut and believed her though, and cut off the person who had supposedly raped her. About a month later, she admitted to having made it up because she was angry at him for dumping her, and a few weeks later she asked him out. This girl was a raging narcissist and known for trying to one-up people and had also faked multiple mental illnesses in the past. It was fucked. I truly hope that’s not the situation here but I can’t help but see the similarities."
ChoosingBeggars,fm05wg6,t3_frzaey,1585645971.0,"I worked in a small, authentic, family-run Thai place for a few years. I’d have this conversation with a customer almost every week:

“Can I get the Pad Thai extra spicy?

- “Sure, how spicy do you want it?”

“As spicy as you can. Do your worst.”

- “Are you sure? Thai spicy is very hot. Most people can’t handle our spiciest”

“Trust me, I can handle it. I’ve had worse.”

Then 15 minutes later when the food came out I’d get called over to take away the dish and replace it with a milder one for free because the original was “way too spicy”"
tifu,fm047wz,t1_flzp9kd,1585644052.0,"Shopping on acid is a wild experience. A friend and I walked to 7-11 once after we had just taken some new tabs we’d got in. We hadn’t expected to start tripping until we got back but they hit pretty much as soon as we got into the store. Spent anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours wandering around in there, I still have no idea how long it really was. When we came in the Coca Cola slurpee machine was at the beginning of its cycle and by the time we left it was completely finished."

AskWomen,flyomk7,t1_flx8wzv,1585606085.0,"That’s a very sad case of wasted talent as result of untreated mental illness. It seems like he’s had brief stints of proper medication and treatment- there were periods of time where he went a while without tweeting anything wild or saying anything crazy and it seemed like he was doing better. It’s been while since he’s seemed mentally healthy though and at this point it seems like we’re seeing more of his bipolar symptoms than we are of his actual personality. Untreated or improperly treated Bipolar I can really fuck a person’s life up and seem to completely change their personality. If you listen to his first album, The College Dropout, and compare it to later albums like Yeezus, you can really see how much self awareness he lost and how much the disorder took over. He went from rapping about his insecurities to calling himself a god."
BPD,flus5km,t1_fluqt1d,1585508903.0,"That does sound like a rough situation, sorry you’re having to deal with a shitty roommate during such an already challenging time. I think your best bet in this situation is to remain civil with her but focus on yourself; you already know she’s going to piss you off, so its best to find healthy ways to get your anger out until you can find new living arrangements. You can’t control what happens, but you can control your reaction to it. Fortunately, a diagnosis of BPD is not required to start DBT; I actually didn’t get diagnosed until a couple months after my first DBT sessions. Try searching online for DBT near you, obviously everywhere has switched to zoom conferencing for now but I’d assume most are still accepting new patients."
BPD,fluos7e,t3_fr9hcm,1585506917.0,"Congrats on signing up for DBT! You’ve started on the path to mental health. The number one thing my therapist reminds me of is that seeking help means you want to get better; bad people don’t want to get better. Good people do. So you’re not a bad person. Remember that. However, it is possible you’ve acted in ways that have hurt people unintentionally. I know I have in the past. Sometimes when you love someone a lot and really trust them and feel close to them, you can unload all your emotions and baggage on them without even realizing it. To you and me and most people with BPD, a relationship like this seems amazing because you feel like the person truly cares about you enough to listen. However, from the other side, it can seem suffocating to the person you’re venting to. They may feel like you’re unloading all these issues on them and there’s no way for them to help you. They might feel like they’re making things worse, or like they’re not strong enough or smart enough to help you. Sometimes, it may even seem like you just want them there as someone to complain to rather than someone to be friends with. Whenever I tell a friend about a problem I’m having, I always like to remind them first that I’m just venting and that if they’re not up talking right now it’s okay. Also, whenever you feel yourself getting mad at someone and starting to split, have yourself make a list of all the things you like about them. Maybe even tell them some of the things. This can help you prevent yourself from thinking in black and white and cutting people off while worked up. Another essential skill is being able to walk away from a tense situation; figure out a way to let the person know that you care about their point of view but that you don’t feel you’re in the right state to talk at the moment. “I need some time to cool down, could we talk about this later? I don’t want to say anything I don’t mean” is a good way to go about it. It gives them a peak into your brain and lets them know you’re trying your best to be fair. Good luck with treatment! I think you’ll find it pays off."
BPD,flunpiy,t3_fraa8s,1585506294.0,"Are you by any chance in DBT? DBT skills can be incredibly helpful for things like this. One of my favorites for when I’m splitting and unable to tell whether a person is genuinely toxic or if I’m just being irrational, is to make a list of all the things I like about the person- all the things that contradict the bad things I’m saying about them in my head. Maybe she does the dishes a lot, or lets you vent to her about work. Keeping yourself from thinking in black in white (good vs evil) is essential to thinking clearly and being rational. Really push yourself to think of all the things you like about her. If you can only think of bad things, that may be a sign that she actually is a toxic person who shouldn’t be in your life. Either way, take at least a day to let your emotions go down before making any drastic decisions or saying anything that may start an argument. Managing BPD symptoms really is all about rewiring the way you you think."
BPD,flumz14,t3_fqxf9c,1585505873.0,"Sometimes when my friends start hanging out with new people I have this feeling at first like “why do they deserve so much of your attention? I’m the one who’s always been here for you.”, but I have to remind myself that this is not a healthy way to think. Just because your friends are meeting new people doesn’t mean you’re becoming any less valuable to them; remember that they’re also growing and developing as a person and part of that includes getting to know new people and maybe coupling up. If I were you I try to reach out to their new friends and get to know them. Even if you don’t instantly click with them and all become best friends, you’ll be doing a good thing for everyone involved and showing that you’re an accepting person who’s open to change. Another thing that I think can be a factor with BPD is the black and white thinking- feeling as though you have to either be best friends with someone or not friends at all. It may seem like it’s not worth talking to someone if you’re not going to become very close, but it’s actually really good and healthy to have a circle of casual acquaintances and friends of friends. Try to view this as a positive thing- it’s your chance to meet new people who you already have a friend in common with."
trashy,flulyx1,t1_flsirjo,1585505285.0,"How? Explain yourself. People with BPD experience difficulty controlling their emotions and fear of abandonment and become defensive when they feel they are being attacked; this woman was not being attacked. She became aggressive and confrontational for no reason and acted toxic just for the sake of it. This is not representative of BPD. I don’t know why you’re so set on making victims of a disorder out as villains, but it’s cruel and ignorant of you. Please reconsider speaking on topics that you know little to not nothing about. Your actions have consequences; think of all the people who are struggling with BPD who have now read your comment and decided they are too afraid to seek help or treatment and be labeled as monsters."

teenagers,flsatg8,t3_fqbj9c,1585438037.0,"Kudos for sticking with her despite her issues! I have BPD and I’ve lost of couple friends as result of it; my emotional reactions are too much for some people so even though it’s rough and I miss them I had to accept that they needed to put themselves first. However, I’ve sought help since then and am doing much better now. It’s a common misconception that people with BPD are unable to keep friendships, but that’s definitely not true; you just need to make some adjustments sometimes and find the most effective way to communicate. Sometimes your friend might misinterpret things you say as being mean or aggressive, and she might get very emotional or even start thinking you hate her; remember that this is just the way her brain is wired and she doesn’t truly distrust you. People with BPD have irregularities in their brain structure that causes them to not be able to handle emotional distress as well. Most of our symptoms stem from a fear of abandonment; we can be constantly afraid that the people we love most don’t actually love us and are about to leave us, and some people may go to extremes to prevent this perceived abandonment, and in extreme cases the person might become manipulative (this is not on purpose, people with BPD usually don’t recognize when they’re being manipulative). Remember that if things become too intense it’s always okay to back away; you’re her friend and you should support her, but not at the cost of your own mental health. If things are getting too heated or you feel like an argument is coming, the best way to deal with it is to say “I don’t feel like this conversation is productive right now. Can we talk later after I’ve had some time to cool off?” Assuming she’s not in treatment already, you could also recommend she starts a DBT group. DBT has been incredibly helpful for me in managing my symptoms and being a more patient and understanding person. 

Sorry for writing a novel lol, I have a lot to say on this topic. You sound like a lovely person and your friend is lucky to have you in her life. Remember that the most important thing you can do for her is listen."
