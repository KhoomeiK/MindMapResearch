misanthropy,fql4r2x,t3_gi75qp,1589446201.0,I think maturity as it relates to this instance means you are able to rise above the pseudo-insults and not give them the oxygen they need to survive.

misanthropy,fql2tlz,t1_fqhb4qv,1589444295.0,"I‚Äôm not a part of this sub, but as an outsider I may have some perspective. It appears as if you want to keep a broad appeal to maximize exposure to misanthropy but do not wish to sacrifice the essence of true misanthropy as you see it.  The answer is less people. More restrictions and tighter guidelines to preserve the intellectual integrity of the mission. Use national parks and nature preserves as a similar metaphor. To keep the parks enjoyable the DNR is there to enforce guidelines of behavior. I‚Äôm sure it sucks to be a gatekeeper but if you truly want to run this sub, you have to tell people ‚Äúno.‚Äù And also correct them, otherwise they will not understand the error of their way and resent the cause you have spent so much time and effort to cultivate. It only takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch. You have to stay committed to monitoring content, which is a thankless task, but extremely invaluable to keeping a community such as this clean and running effectively.
