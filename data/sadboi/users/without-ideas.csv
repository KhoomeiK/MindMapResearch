And I think your brother is not mentioned because of the shame your parents might feel because they couldn't see it help that your brother committed suicide.

I think that to end it all is not the answer.

May sound kinda hippie new age bullsht but in situations of complete overwhelming, like the one you are experiencing now, looking into Vipassana meditation, might help.

There's even a documentary of murderers that changed through this meditation.

Might help put things in order an in perspective.

You might realize that you can be one of the world's good people, that help make it a better place.

Try looking into it

ExistentialSupport,faxxjt0,t1_faq6yic,1576391610.0,"That's it for me too!

Optimistic nihilism,
Trying to make other people lives better,
And gratefulness."
SuicideWatch,faxx5st,t1_faqoslp,1576391426.0,"I am really sorry to hear all that!

But as for your loved friend who doesn't want to be with you, made me think that if she is telling you that she's out with others and that tears you apart, you should sit and talk to her, explain that these things hurt you. Maybe she'll understand. Be open and clear with her.

As for your father, it must have been quite a shock. But we can try to look on the perspective that he was the one who raised you, who educated you, who, without obligation, chose that you would be his son. That's, in my view, a noble act and makes him even better than if he were your biological father all along.

And about your other friends, people tend to get scared in tough situations. But if you talk to them and say what you need from them in this moment, I think they will do what they can to help you. Friends are who we count on in hard times.

As for the three years, I agree with the other guy who said that doctors can be really wrong when it comes to predictions. I heard of a case that the doctors have three months to a guy and it has been more than 12 years now and the man is still alive.

Maybe if you tried, if you feel like it, to help other people. Anything, even small things, little kind gestures, like smiling to a stranger on the street. Maybe you could feel better, since you are using your time to make other people's lives better. We tend to feel rewarded by other people gratitude. And it might bring some lightness to your life.

And lastly, try to talk about your suffering and what you expect from people. It might help you and the people that you care. Might make things easier.

Be kind to yourself and others.
Test yourself as a friend.
Comfort yourself.
Seek a light and weightless life.
Seek peace.

I am here to keep hearing!

You are important!"

Thank you for presenting it to me! Made my day!

I happened to stumble upon their ""**Optimistic nihilism**"" video. It's a really good counterpoint to what you are feeling now. I recommend you watching it, if you didn't already. If so, watch again and let their words sink in, i believe it will make you feel better. 

And for me, that's what I thought about life at all. It was nice to see it somewhere else.

Live a happy life, doing things that make you feel good. And try to make other people/animal feel good too (for bonus points) :D ( I, for instance, saved a beetle from drowning today... Made me feel good... Made me think that in some way I improved the world... his world.. I don't know... but I guess you can understand what I'm saying)

Be kind to yourself (emotionally and physically), enjoy your existence.

Seek pleasure with no harm (within your moral code)

And thanks again, for making my world better today!

Hope I helped in some way. :D

depression,faf6m8a,t3_e8s2zj,1576015650.0,"I believe that our feelings come from some place.
We all have them from time to time. Those depressing feelings.
I believe we have them because of some events in our lives. It may not be all clear to us why we are feeling like that, but, in my view, there is a reason for them.
So, what helps is talk about them with somebody.
Because once we speak, we put things in order in our heads, and we may even be surprised by what comes out when we talk about our feelings.
So try to talk to someone about what you are feeling. And try to seek some reason why they are there (they might look silly to is sometimes, but it helps to speak about what you feel).
So the start in the process of getting better is just to speak and try to discover why you feel like this.

ExistentialSupport,fac3tn2,t3_e6uyan,1575933111.0,"I agree with toxictoy, and to add something, in my conception it's just a matter of perspective. Because if you think in yourself when you were younger, like in highschool, you were in a totally different place than your job now.

So like buddhism teaches, the secret is to find balance. Even in existential questionings. Because in one end we might ask ourselves ""why am i repeating the same stuff for this whole time for too long?"" and in the other we may think ""since the earth is eventually going to end, why do i even do anything?""

So, for me, the secret has been enjoying little things in my days. (of course there are rough days, but i really enjoy most of my days). Like toxictoy said.

And the balance for me to deal with those kind of existential questions has been make things that make me happy, trying to help whomever i can (within my possibilities - financial, emotional, timewise, etc.), without harming myself.

Being happy, making people happy, making lifes better, making the world a little bit better.

Because in the end, for me, what matters is not so much existence per se, but lives. Mine and others."

It's really important to share your burden with others.
Once we share we feel lighter.
It's hard to talk about negative stuff, but if you keep it to yourself it will only increase.

Share and allow yourself to be helped by others.

Life is hard sometimes, but there are people that loves us, and there are good people in the world, and they (we) are here for you in this hard time.

Psicanalise,fa6w51s,t3_ce4kfg,1575829158.0,"Não podemos tomar a citação de Freud como a resposta completa. Já que, podemos considerar que o suicídio é um sintoma ""por ter vontade de matar outra pessoa (pulsão de morte), mas canaliza o alvo em si."", mas não devemos esquecer que todo sintoma resulta de elementos do inconsciente, que, por sua vez, são feitos de elementos da realidade. 

Então, o tratamento seria, através da análise, a compreensão de quais elementos inconscientes levaram a pessoa à tentativa ou aos pensamentos suicidas e, para isso, devemos identificar as experiências das nossas vidas responsáveis por criarem os conteúdos inconscientes que nos levam ao caminho do suicídio como resposta.

E, eu concordo, ""Se for o seu sintoma, recomendo procurar um analista, se você for um analista, recomendo que procure uma supervisão."", e adiciono, sempre converse com as pessoas. Porque afinal de contas, aprendemos com a psicanálise que a fala tem o poder de cura."
depression,fa6qlo5,t3_e7qvet,1575827532.0,"First of all, since its my first post here, hi Reddit!  


This guy ""Hornman84"". Listen to him.

Remember that you are important to someone. Even if you don't know this person yet. Trust me, we all are important so someone.

I'm a psychologist and one thing i think it helps it's talking about the things that are bothering you with someone you trust. (or even here, we're here to listen and try to help).

Try to break down the reasons that are making you feel worthless, and talk to people close to you about that (or to reddit, or even me)

Once we order things on our heads and share those concerns with people, it becomes more bearable, because once you share, you don't have to support the weight alone. You are not alone!

I hope you can see that are good people in the world trying to genuinely help a stranger. For that reason, for believing there is still good in the world it's worth to keep living.

Don't give up! Share the most you can, it will make you feel better!  
Stay well!"
