Supplements,fgm60b5,t1_fglxp8i,1580918617.0,"Thank you so much. I just bought the DE and psyllium powder. When you said “an equivalent amount” of psyllium, do you mean just the same as to whatever amount of DE I took?

I appreciate this so much. Also where did you learn about this specific approach? From a book or a lecture?"

BPD,fgjvlc2,t3_eytnzr,1580852247.0,"Yes, I obsess about things. I’ve tried making myself think a positive thought for and as a response to every single obsessive thought however- in an attempt to reprogram my brain. 

Sometimes I think my brain is addicted to sadness, and I just really want it to learn to associate positive things to the negative until it slowly becomes addiction to happy thoughts instead.

Mainly joy and gratitude for the small things around me. Not sure if this helps"
BPD,fgjv7zv,t1_fgjr16e,1580852041.0,"This is totally what I was going to say in my response. I love my DBT therapist because I very self-consciously tried to explain this idea to my therapist one day, super sure that he was going to look at me like I was messed up when I told him that I basically “acted” in all of my interactions because my real personality feels super child-like / crazy to me so I don’t show it much.

However, when I told him, he had the best reaction that I really needed to experience and see because he just shrugged his shoulders and said “so what? Life is a show. We are all acting on some level. We all have a child hidden inside of us. But you know what? If it’s going to be a show, I’m going to make it the best damn show I can.”

It always stuck with me. Sometimes I think my “voice of shame” needs to be put in its place and told that I’m not “special”, I’m just like everyone else and what a relief :)"
BPD,fgjuoag,t3_eys4w0,1580851734.0,"That’s awesome, forreal!. I think it’s so cool when life presents us with the chance to learn a new like “skill” kind of and we actually succeed in choosing a different path for ourselves, even if it’s just for a bit. Like for now, you chose yourself and your desire to improve yourself over other things and I think that’s dope.

It’s like character building for the brain kind of. 

Good luck on your DBT journey!"

puppy101,eseipg9,t1_es2elbk,1561900246.0,"Maybe make your post a little less condescending and chastising next time. She’s doing her best and you can’t force a puppy go to sleep. Just like children, you have to let them wear themselves out and work out their exhaustion themselves sometimes while you simply watch. And sometimes puppies manically cry when they’re exhausted and so in that sense they kind of are “crying for no reason.”"
puppy101,es1t53w,t3_c5h1rb,1561505091.0,"I have an 8 week old puppy who becomes mentally unhinged and manically insane when she’s tired and about to crash. I basically have to sit there ignoring her after a certain point because she just runs into furniture and cries at the top of her lungs for no reason. 

She also has no sense of balance so she falls off of my tall bed if she tries to sleep with me but she cries if she can’t sleep with me. So I’m always waking up to crying from being scared from falling or crying from wanting up in the middle of the night. 

I feel your pain. Im just counting down the months until she mellows out a bit around 2 years old. 22 months to go"
puppy101,es03cga,t1_erxdjr3,1561464250.0,This actually makes so much sense! Thank you!!
