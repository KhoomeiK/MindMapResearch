I take prescription sleep meds and melatonin. If I go to sleep any earlier than midnight, I wake up anywhere between 1-3am and can‚Äôt get back to sleep. Some nights it‚Äôs a struggle to stay up that late, not because I am overly tired but just because I am bored and just want to go to sleep. I know if I do, it will be disastrous. 

There are other nights I lose track of time and I find I am awake watching TV until 3-5 am. I will still take my sleep meds and just go to sleep. I will then sleep til noon or so. 

My usual routine is bedtime ~12:30am, wake up between 6-8am to pee. I have chronic pain issues so I will go back to bed on the heating pads for a while.

Can you explain in more detail what time you try to go to sleep? Is the same time every night? What time do you want to get up every day? In the past what was your routine? And how much sleep did you require/do you think you need?

Coronavirus,fkjjfmg,t1_fkiia4w,1584247794.0,"I was watching Neil Degrasse Tyson or whatever that astrophysicist‚Äôs name is. He was explaining something very similar about how the only safe place to be is Africa as it is called the Cape of Hope. Because chances are, the rest of earth definitely won‚Äôt be where it is now if there at all. He went on about this black hole but I definitely didn‚Äôt understand that!"
CoronavirusUS,fkjfoht,t1_fkjc1ho,1584244539.0,"Not sure, you can be sick with pneumonia and need antibiotics but not have blue lips. Blue lips is a sign of hypoxia or not getting enough oxygen in your blood. So depending on other illnesses you have, coronary illness, kidney disease you can have a mild case CV and be very sick or be perfectly healthy and get CV and become very ill very quick. This virus is very unpredictable. What is not unpredictable is how to slow down the spread of ANY communicable disease. They all work basically the same way."
CoronavirusUS,fkjeskk,t1_fkj5ieg,1584243828.0,"This actually makes sense. As a communication company, their services are required so people can work from home. I would like to think there will be a triage system so that like hospitals, Charter is only being dispatched to assist true problem solving calls for businesses that require telecommunications. I know if I lose cable etc, I will be upset but it won‚Äôt be life threatening. If a 911 call center goes down, that‚Äôs another story. No new residents installations should be scheduled for the next two weeks."
CoronavirusUS,fkj5vzv,t1_fki9nn1,1584237016.0,My thoughts too

CoronavirusUS,fkiygx8,t3_fikh61,1584231659.0,We as a community need to help each other. I don‚Äôt believe ppl will lose their homes/ etc initially. During a SOE we are all in the same boat. Just think of the class action law suit that could be brought against any one entity over loss of job etc because of a pandemic. This is another reason why I keep telling my son we need to save money and not spend money as soon as we earn it. I wish everyone the best of luck.
CoronavirusUS,fkixvfh,t1_fki5ack,1584231240.0,I believe Trump has asked for relief of some sort I can‚Äôt remember what he called it.
CoronavirusUS,fkixscz,t1_fkhqkzk,1584231179.0,Why was this downvoted. I thought about the same thing!
