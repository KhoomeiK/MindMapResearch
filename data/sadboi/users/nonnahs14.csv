That being said, along with what has already been mentioned in the other comments - set an intention for the trip. What do you hope to gain from the experience? Tripping teaches you a lot about yourself and the universe, so what do you want to get out of it? It can be just a bit of fun for some people, but do be prepared to see the deepest parts of yourself that you tend not to think about. For me it's a kind of therapy. It will change your life so just think about areas of you life where you'd like to grow."

internetparents,fmxvre6,t3_fy0mhp,1586472837.0,"Oh man, you took me back 15 years asking these questions.

1. Most teenagers hate themselves. I did, most of my friends did even though they pretended not to. What helped me is thinking all these negative thoughts about yourself are just echoes from what you've heard from other people and media your whole life. Being a teenager is awful, awkward, you're figuring out what's expected of you by your peers, parents, teachers, and its easy to be hard on yourself. You're right about puberty, it fucks with your head. Give yourself a break, try to be kind to yourself.
2. Yes. You can masturbate as much as you want. People make a lot of masturbation jokes but almost everyone does it. It becomes more normal and less taboo when you become an adult, it's healthy. Anyone who doesn't masturbate is either lying or missing out. Enjoy your body.
3. Your hormones make you feel sexually energised and sometimes that can be confused with admiration, so although you might be attracted to this guy, you might not be gay or even bi. Sexuality is fluid, and it's not black and white. If you are gay or bi then thats fine, just explore the idea and see how it makes you feel.
4. If I could go back in time and give myself a piece of advice, it would be stop TRYING to make people like you. I know it feels like the most important thing in the world right now, but honestly you won't give a fuck in 10 years time if you have genuine friends. I know its cliche but just be yourself. Being a teenager is about discovering who you are, don't let other people's opinions and expectations shape you. Relax, be authentic, and the right people will like you for you. Everyone else can think you're a dork and it shouldn't matter. Only care about the opinions of people who care about you.

Good luck navigating puberty, its a rollercoaster as I'm sure you've realised. You'll be fine.

I'm glad that theres a culture of using drugs safely to spread awareness of this kind of stuff."
internetparents,fmtgtvt,t3_fxb7ih,1586372476.0,"She's your mother, if you have a good relationship with her then she won't hate you. She's probably incredibly angry with you. You put her family in danger when there are thousands and thousands of people dying out there. You did fuck up, but this won't last forever. Just reflect on it for a while, think about how this has affected your family, understand why they're mad at you. Then you can make a proper apology, and move on. People fuck up all the time, what's important is what you learn from it."
Drugs,fmtfwvm,t3_fx6aql,1586372033.0,"I completely understand and agree with your main point here, but I think its stupid not to have a fear of drugs even if you use them. Drugs can be incredibly unpredictable and have such negative effects on you, that by the time you realise, its too late to just stop. I do think that most of this comes from them being illegal though, lack of education, misinformation etc. But it is important to be weary. Even weed isn't as innocent on peoples lives like stoners say it is - it took a lot for me to stop smoking it every day and it affected me a lot. All drugs have dangers to them, yes even shrooms. They should always be treated with caution, never think you're invincible.

I do agree though, I feel sad for people who are TOO scared to try them because they're missing out on so much. I wouldn't be the person I am today if it wasn't for all of the drugs I've ever tried. Drugs have made me a more open minded, passionate, grateful, compassionate person and I think that opportunity should be made available for everyone in a safe, educated way."

bigboobproblems,fms6kqm,t3_fx4yx0,1586348119.0,"I'm an E cup (although I think I've grown again) but people tend to not believe me because my back is only a 30, so yeah although some D cups are bigger than mine, they're smaller in proportion. How women don't understand how bra sizes work is beyond me."
Parenting,fmpcgmn,t3_fwkjj2,1586278373.0,"My mother hit me a couple times as a kid but then immediately apologised and I've never been angry towards her because it wasn't abuse, it was just a single mother to 3 kids losing her rag. Its ok to get it wrong sometimes. The main thing here is your husband. Based in what you've said in this post he is an absolute asshole. He is probably the one contributing to a lot of your stress if this isn't unusual behaviour. If you're in a position to be alone then let him leave. You're probably better off with just you and your son."
