Stimulants. This group of drugs has treated ADHD for several decades. These medicines might help you focus your thoughts and ignore distractions. Stimulant meds work for 70% to 80% of people. They’re used to treat moderate and severe ADHD. They may be helpful for children, teens, and adults who have a hard time at school, work, or home. Some stimulants are approved for use in children over age 3. Others are approved for children over age 6.

Some stimulants are Adderall, ritalin, focalin, vyvanse


Non-stimulants. In cases where stimulants don’t work or cause unpleasant side effects, non-stimulants might help. These medications can improve symptoms like concentration and impulse control.


Some non stimulants are intuniv & strattera


Antidepressants. People with ADHD often have depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder too. They may take an antidepressant to control mental health issues or other conditions along with a stimulant for ADHD

There are tons of antidepressants but wellbutrin in my, humble, has been good for ADHD for me. 

And about your family... you are an adult. At this point it is up to you. If it isnt interfering with your life then dont do anything about it, but if it is it is probably worth looking into further, no matter what anyone thinks of you.

mentalhealth,fnx2pxq,t1_fnx0n2w,1587330310.0,"Most good therapists and psychiatrists will tell you if you ask. Just straight up ask what their policy is for involuntary hospitalization.

If it helps Ive been through several therapists/psychiatrists and have never been hospitalized. I have schizoaffective disorder and Ive told them some intense suicidal thoughts and have been floridly psychotic a few times during appointments. It takes quite a bit for them to FORCE anything on you

If your therapist seems too uncomfortable with suicidal thoughts get a new therapist. They dont have enough experience and you should never feel the need to have to “baby” your therapist.

It is unlikely anything you say will be too shocking to them.

You are only hurting yourself by keeping things from them. The longer it takes for you to be open the less they can help you"
mentalhealth,fnwwhly,t3_g4cp6u,1587326815.0,"You dont want to deal with schizophrenia- its horrible and scary and a lifetime of medication and hes right, a potentially shorter lifespan.

You DONT want that. 

You want attention. Which isnt necessarily a bad thing. Have you tried talking to him about how you feel? Have you tried seeking therapy? 

If you go to therapy the sessions will be all about YOU and you will be able to explore these feelings you are having without having to worry about anyone else suffering but yourself.

It sounds like you DO have issues that therapy would help with because no, it isnt normal to want to suffer. 

But this isnt going to go away on its own. You need to at the very least be honest with your boyfriend because if you dont, it sounds like you may end up resenting him and that is definitely not the direction you want to go in. 

Best of luck to you. Depression is hard. Schizophrenia is hard. Both things cause people to suffer. Both things need treatment"
schizophrenia,fnwuben,t3_g4apey,1587325594.0,My voices dont really say complete sentences to me. They say more phrases that dont make sense or speak to each other with words that are jarbled that sound like two people talking in another room. They sound really real but after a minute or so I can usually tell its a delusion
mentalhealth,fnwkqh5,t3_g40fx1,1587320250.0,"I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type.

Take medication. Keep your sleep schedule regular. Dont experiment with drugs. Join support groups like NAMI or DBSA. There are plenty of things you can do to make things easier"
mentalhealth,fnwkjls,t3_g438v7,1587320143.0,"If he actually believes hes got a disease it probably isnt munchausens and more like a somatorom disorder. Munchausens people generally are aware they arent ill but create/fabriacte fake symptoms for attention. His sounds more anxiety related from what you are saying here than needing attention related.

Still same issue, different name.

Just continue to try to convince him to stick with mental health care would be my advice"
mentalhealth,fnwi0xn,t3_g41t77,1587318757.0,One of the people I share my apartment with found one of my pills and texted to everyone asking whose it was. I was pretty embarassed. I dont really tell anyone irl about my condition tho so thats really it. People stigmatize it too much
mentalhealth,fnwh26d,t3_g46bmh,1587318236.0,Dont do this. It is just opening the door to shame and sadness and any refief you get from it will not be worth it
mentalhealth,fnwgwoe,t3_g46jxn,1587318153.0,Its actually a ton easier for me to interact here than IRL. There are less social rules to remember and less pressure to respond to things immediately.
mentalhealth,fnwgkhh,t3_g47e5d,1587317975.0,"Im 24 and I suffer from schizoaffective disorder. It was really hard for me at first but after a while, with medication and therapy, things have gotten a lot better.

If I can do it you can do it. Theres nothing special about me that cant work for you too."
mentalhealth,fnwgdpe,t3_g404pw,1587317873.0,"Im like this too, especially socially. Sometimes social stuff moves so fast that its basically impossible to keep up. I come off as really socially dull. Idk if its because of medication or mental illness but its extremely frustrating feeling so behind everyone all the time"
mentalhealth,fnwfk66,t3_g4986w,1587317430.0,"This might be a mixed blessing. I mean. Now you dont have to hide it from your dad. Now you can get help.

Do you currently live with your Dad? If not I recommend telling him to call you when hes calmed down enough to have a calm conversation with him and then just be as honest, while still being kind, as possible. This will be hard for him and hard for you but if you can communicate in a healthy manner what you need, this could work out well for you. 

Im sorry things are hard for you, but it sounds like you have a caring friend"
schizophrenia,fnukze5,t1_fnukvjd,1587264606.0,Def! Im going to keep track of how things go and if they get too bad Ill just start right up again. So it should all be good either way
schizophrenia,fnuk5os,t1_fns52wp,1587264039.0,This is too true and a wonderful post.
