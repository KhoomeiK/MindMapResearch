Advice,fkkztn9,t3_fj2d1b,1584295435.0,"Restaurants, grocery stores, fast food. All used to high turnover rate. During interviews donâ€™t tell them youâ€™re leaving in just a couple months and donâ€™t feel bad that you are. They are used to employees coming and going"

StudentLoans,fcwmr5e,t3_ej4w03,1578030043.0,"Good for you and keep it going! I like how you added you had some fun time for yourself, it makes me realize debt doesnâ€™t have to be scary while being attached to you. Itâ€™s important to live life as well and not be so wrapped up in paying it off. Thanks for the story!"
truelesbians,fcwmf2x,t3_ej937m,1578029751.0,"My partner and I have been dating for almost two years. We super liked each other on tinder back in 2015 when I was going to University in SF and she was visiting for the holidays on break from high school. I messaged her but she never message back since she lived in NY at the time. Rewind to summer of 2017, I ended up transferring to a school in Idaho and got tinder again and scrolled back on my past conversations. I clicked on our lack of a convo and ended up stalking her IG and realizing that we both now went to the same college. I followed her and that fall we would often see each other on campus but no one acknowledged the other. Partly because she had a gf at the time and I am shy. Finally, I was stuck in an airport for about 8 hours because of a flight delay and we ran into each other and thatâ€™s when we started talking and havenâ€™t stopped since. Itâ€™s crazy how life kept bringing us together. I often think sheâ€™s my soulmateðŸ˜½"
truelesbians,fcw1wea,t1_fcvljd0,1578015235.0,Iâ€™m sorry you had issues in those places but good to know about the others
truelesbians,fcuvwhi,t1_fcuuu3j,1577989613.0,Thanks for the tips! Weâ€™ll definitely check out the guides before we choose a place
truelesbians,fcuvobu,t1_fcusspi,1577989489.0,"Thanks for the comment, this was extremely helpful. Iâ€™m definitely more masculine than my partner, I think of myself as a stud and my partner as more of a fem. Iâ€™m comfortable in my skin and donâ€™t mind the looks, I just wouldnâ€™t want it to extend past that."
truelesbians,fcutt8i,t3_eirw1w,1577988352.0,"Iâ€™m currently in a relationship with a woman who has a very high libido while I donâ€™t. I find this as an opportunity to focus on her needs and wants. Just last night, she was wanting to have sex and I didnâ€™t feel like wanting her to go down on me or be inside me, so I always communicate that with her and then we play a game of her bossing me around telling me what she wants and what Iâ€™m allowed to do next. I think it all just takes communication and you being comfortable with your partner. The anxiousness will go away as you gain trust and feel more comfortable."

Advice,fcowqbv,t1_fcolptw,1577843671.0,Thank you. This helped a lot.
truelesbians,fcntlyx,t1_fcjbdo3,1577818168.0,Exactly!
truelesbians,fch5xly,t3_egnbtb,1577647592.0,"What helped me the most was unfriending the person completely. Off of social media and even blocking them from reaching out to me. I know that sounds a little immature but it helped me be able to focus on my own healing rather than being concerned what they were doing or who they were with. 
Also time. All my healing progressed by being away from that person and letting time take its course. 
Iâ€™m sorry that happened to you, very shitty."
truelesbians,fbspml2,t3_ee8zsi,1577058462.0,"Depends on the ex! Some Iâ€™m friends with on social media, some I havenâ€™t seen or spoken to since we cut ties. Just depends on how it ended for me. It always took me a year or two before I could befriend an ex though. I always need healing and closure time"
Dermatophagia,f5s3qbb,t1_f5qfrrb,1572410760.0,Do you bite when the skin is wet? I typically do it a lot when I get out of the shower and the skin is still wet :/
Dermatophagia,f5s3lv7,t1_f5qpv1h,1572410633.0,I was thinking of getting something like this. I think I will invest. Itâ€™s worth a shot
Dermatophagia,f5qbldo,t1_f5pjh35,1572375116.0,I think Iâ€™ll try this for sure
Dermatophagia,f5piisy,t1_f5out9p,1572360201.0,Yeah Iâ€™m constantly moisturizing. It helps temporarily but then I always get back to biting them. Iâ€™ve been thinking about going to the doctor and trying to get on some anti anxiety medication and see if that helps but I havenâ€™t made the time to do it yet
Advice,exj0of7,t1_exj05yy,1566339487.0,Thanks for the reassurance. I feel like Iâ€™ll be fine but thereâ€™s this thought in my head like nah youâ€™re fucked
