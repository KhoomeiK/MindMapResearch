Trouble is Didi does this thing where he has said this is about thinking style and yet a lot of the descriptions are about behaviour and while you might be able to predict behaviour from thought I don't know if you can predict thoughts from behaviour.

For example poor communication being symptomatic of both Impressionistic and lateral thinkers.

Some labels are given more objective clarificaiton whilst some are only defined through descriptions of characters personalities.

Also for what is supposed to be a chart for thinking style there is a lot of discussion of behaviour. Whilst you can say that you can predict behaviour from thinking style I don't think you can track back from behaviour the thought process.

What makes this grid intriguing is that whilst the labels might be wrong the placement of anime characters did seem to follow a logical pattern. We just have to figure out the best was to describe what that pattern is.

Ideally you would have a  test that would rank people according to the two axis and then deliver them to a results page that would then give the information associated with their sector.

I have always been fine with lexical versus impressionists, for some reason the have always fit perfectly in describing what they mean to describe. They are describing a preference towards categorisation. However Digi did make the point that Lexical people will tend towards an OBJECTIVE lexicon. The're categorisations will be according to objective measures as far as possible. I thought Lexical captured this idea quite well as impressionistic implies subjectivity.

Having thought about it after doing some reading and watching some of Digi's old videos I decided that what he means by lateral is really multi. Some people describe constantly having multiple streams of thought at any one time (though this isn't possible technically speaking as far as we know in psychology), being able to have multiple simultaneous thoughts. I also noticed that Digi tends to approach a problem by building multiple solutions at the same time, or creating a project that is actually four projects in one.

He is still very much a critical thinker though, all his analysis videos involve a lot of analytical and critical thinking but both are examples of linear thinking. The fact that analyses itself is linear ha borked the chart somewhat.

You can say that there is a kind of approach to analysis u can take with lateral thinking but it is not analyses itself. Analysis through the use of your accumulated data is analytical thinking which is a linear process not lateral.

I was just watching his video ""Balls Deep in Adventure"" his Kusomega design blog.

It is helping understand his idea of lateral thinking (as did your explanation of House of Leaves). Digi can't focus on a train of thought for more than a few seconds. He has to run one train of thought whilst also running parallel thoughts along side it.

He was trying to write a light novel but he couldn't write the novel whilst also teaching himself about story boarding, learning how to work with artists, creating accompanying comics, and also thinking ahead to making a full Manga whilst also thinking about context is which these pursuits fit together to be a single ""story"" in his mind.

He can't have a project without having a project about the project and projects in accessory to the project. A work, an idea, is really concept requiring exploration through many different mediums simultaneously some of which will explore the meta of the work.

And it all seems to be th e only way he can think about things.

It's like he is Inception diving on his own mind. He has thoughts then thoughts about those thoughts etc constantly running two or three layers deep.

Baring in mind all analytical and critical thought is linear. Lateral thought is only brought in if:

1.) Current paradigms aren't working

2.) You are in a purely creative mindset.

What percentage of the day can you stay in either mindset? Maybe some artistic or philosophers could spend 50% of the day never having a linear thought but that seems unlikely. 

People who can think laterally only do so maybe 10% of the time, you use lateral thoughts to jump from one linear mode of thinking to another.

The longest I have seen someone use lateral thinking for example would be someone solving a puzzle. When stuck on a puzzle you brain storm solutions. But you only ever brainstorm until you have an idea at which point you implement the new idea. Implementing and evaluating an idea is all linear. Artists, engineers, scientists, customer service agents, all might use lateral thinking when stuck on a given problem. Anyone can use this thinking strategy but no one is in a lateral mindset for any extended period.

Putting lateral and linear on a axis and then saying L is 100% lateral is to completely ignore what these thinking strategies actually entail.

The difference is that Digi is only interested in the cognitive aspect as opposed to the cognitive and behavioural. A shift in psychology that already happened in the early 1900s."
Neurotyping,fnmianq,t1_fnmg769,1587071927.0,"Did you mean ""instinct"" in that first sentence? I would say that is impressionistic. These people will follow concepts that make sense to them in terms of their subjective experience and language but will find difficulty in explaining these concepts or thoughts or decisions in objective terms.

Liner v Lateral just isn't an even divide as all people will be linear the vast majority of the time. Lateral thinking is a tool that gets you our of one linear thought and into another. Someone being 100% lateral would never form a rational thought, they would hop constantly from concept to concept without ever perusing a single one. Digi really doesn't understand lateral thinking as it was conceived by the guy who invented it and as it is commonly understood.

The characters he describes as 100% lateral are very linear thinkers who just know how to think laterally when necessary.

So really the vertical axis is more like logical or mental flexibility, your ability to abandon a line of reasoning as necessary, again this is starting to sound like Trait Openness in psychological terms.

Openness

A person with a high level of openness to experience ... enjoys trying new things. They are imaginative, curious, and open-minded. Individuals who are low in openness to experience would rather not try new things. They are close-minded, literal and enjoy having a routine.

---

I also think that the vertical axis is also describing someone's proclivity towards practical knowledge versus theoretical knowledge. It seems to be conflating multiple variables at once."
Neurotyping,fnmh29l,t1_fnmewoc,1587071293.0,"N2 yes.

I think you got the majority of characters spot on at least as far as I can tell. Adam does use lateral thinking at the end when he chooses to disconnect as that is an attempt to approach a situation by adopting a new concept. However up to that point his thinking is still mostly linear.

Pascal is quite lateral as seen in his need preference for education across all subjects

To be honest I don't think it is possible for anyone to think laterally more than a very small parentage of the time as lateral thinking is the opposite of rational thinking. What percentage of the day can you be irrational?"
Neurotyping,fnmfk2l,t1_fnmb0uh,1587070523.0,"Absolutely the idea of he axis is that people can display the different extremes to different extent. However the problem with vertical axis is exemplified with L being positioned there. Because Digi has analytical and lateral thinking conflated when they are separate.

Critical and analytical thinking are linear processes. A 100% lateral thinker would be someone unable to think critically. The value of lateral thinking is that it allows you to break out of current logical traps and look at a situation from a new paradigm.

L beat Light because L can employ lateral thinking where L really can't to the same extent. However both characters are far more linear than lateral as most of their time is spent using critical thought and deductive reasoning. They are logical whereas lateral thinking isn't logical by definition.

A true lateral thinker is a truly creative person, a person whose thoughts leap from one idea to another outside or even against logic."
Neurotyping,fnmend9,t1_fnmdr6b,1587070057.0,"I would like some radical changes. The vertical axis needs redefining, something closer to Openmindedness. Closedminded - Openminded. Not sure that is right either though. 

Openness is a psychologically valid metric."
Neurotyping,fnmeagb,t1_fnmdnlo,1587069873.0,Sweat! I know it's not as good as NA in some ways but I would still love to play it!
Neurotyping,fnme5xq,t3_g2hhks,1587069809.0,"Putting Nui off the grid, such an HI - Type thing to ;)"
Neurotyping,fnmcukl,t1_fnmal2x,1587069131.0,"There will always be flaws, we just have to get to a stage where we are happy the flaws don't break the whole concept.

I mean we can nitpick the category labels forever but all that matters is there are definitions that we can all refer to.

I think the whole model is flawed to the extent that Linear and lateral thinking are tools that are used situational and aren't an inherent trait.

Also analysis is a linear thought process not lateral but that is NEVER going to change no matter how much I point that out.

At the end of the day we are doing this for fun and I don't want to spoil the enjoyment that exploring these ideas brings by getting hung up on perfecting the model."
Neurotyping,fnmcdlx,t1_fnltgiy,1587068889.0,"I wish this was on PC, would love to play it. NA is my favourite game of all time."
Neurotyping,fnmcajg,t3_g2js3m,1587068846.0,"Also I wouldn't put any character above the halfway mark in terms of Lateral thinking. They are all machines and the entire narrative (of Automata at least) is of machines trying to break out of their current paradigm.

9S is probably the most capable of lateral thinking given his creative problem solving skills in combat:

Spoilers?

1. Using his flight suit to crash into the Engels arm to save 2B, 
2. use of the coastal mortar and use of the missiles in the fight against the boss monster.
3. Saving himself at the end of routes A and B

All good examples of problem solving using lateral thinking. However he uses linear reasoning most of the time.

The red girls though, that is interesting. Their only real example of lateral thinking is what they engineered as the cycle of the machine war. The machines are defined by their lack of creativity and this idea they had to create the cycle of endless war seems like the only example of lateral thinking that comes to mind.

Arguably the most lateral thinkers are the Pods, they seem to go through the biggest cognitive shift out of anyone. Except Jean-Paul! Who seems to be a machine that fell down a lateral thinking black whole and basically went insane! 

Jean Paul should be top left absolutely."
Neurotyping,fnmavdc,t3_g2js3m,1587068126.0,"Still playing this game as I started for the first time a couple weeks ago. So loving this chart.

Are we calling these graphs, charts, grids?"
Neurotyping,fnmaih0,t1_fnm9n7u,1587067946.0,"Not about being superficial I just wouldn't discount the subconscious effects of these labels. The whole point of the concepts we have been thinking about is that many people think and reason using impressions. Many people will naturally resist certain labels based on the impression the label gives.

On the other side really lexical people will resist a label if it's definition doesn't match their self assessment."
Neurotyping,fnma1vg,t1_fnm7p7r,1587067710.0,"That's the tough thing because social media facilitates lexical discourse not impressionistic, at least unless people are going to post paintings or songs about neurotyping lol!

I would hypothesis that the people who jumped straight into creating N graphs of their own based are the people on the I end of the axis. Whilst us Lexicals are the ones writing endless paragraphs about the concepts and labels and category labels.

I bet if you tallied up image posts versus text posts you would get perfect correlation between the Is and Ls"
Neurotyping,fnm9jpi,t1_fnm7dpz,1587067452.0,"You are absolutely correct. I am happy for us to just to settle on any 16 words as along as we all agree what they mean. There will be advantages and disadvantages to any labelling system. 

There is just a fear that certain words influence people too much, I think shadow guardian was a good example though I think even bookkeeper fits this. No one is going to want to say they are a bookkeeper. So the words should be as neutral as possible."
Neurotyping,fnm94dl,t1_fnm2xo9,1587067239.0,"As long as we have a definitive model with official definitions then we can all use it. Some of the problems I see are baked in at this point and probably won't change. 

My biggest two issues are:

1. Linear/Lateral are opposites but they are not a continuum. Both are tools anyone can use, they don't describe innate cognitive styles that Digi would like them to. They are situational, you might be linear at work in the office and lateral at home with your hobby. You are linear when following rules but lateral when problem solving.
2. Analysis is linear. Digi founded this model on the idea that analysis is lateral when that just isn't the case by any definition of analysis outside of his own and that is causing a lot of confusion. Linear thinking can be both analysis and critical thinking, lateral thinking is creative not decisive.  I think the model itself is a product of Digi's lateral thinking but the whole attempt to explain it, define it's variables and labels, and implement it is all through linear thinking. I think Digi uses more linear thinking than he realises."
Neurotyping,fnm8b0o,t3_g2kzm7,1587066840.0,"I would love to keep revising the model. However all that really matters is the we all agree on the definitions and how it should be used. 

We could discuss changes to it forever, I certainly would make drastic changes, I even think the whole Linear/Lateral axis is incorrect as a concept.

However all that really matters is that we all agree on the concept. So if Digibro just lays down definitive meanings then we can lay down our tools and just work with his definitions, his final version."
Neurotyping,fnm7aa7,t1_fnltfkn,1587066331.0,"I don't know about that because linear is analytical (analysis really is in the wrong place on this model). The utility of this modal to organise people into data points or categories is nice, systematic way of working, it's a way of building data on many subjects through a single paradigm (linear) as opposed to trying to solve a single problem be using many different paradigms (lateral)."
