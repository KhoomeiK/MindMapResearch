I once hired a woman with no experience but had a desire to learn. Let’s call her Sarah. Sarah needed more training, coaching, and helped out a lot more. She took longer to ramp up but slowly and surely she did.
Ten years later, Bob is still in the same position he was in when I hired him, which is fine. Bob is content. Sarah on the other hand is now my peer and manages another team. I personally referred and advocated for her. Sarah is the least-experienced, highest-risk hiring choice I ever made due to her complete lack of experience. But you know what? She was a blank slate that wanted to learn. She is still the best hire I ever had and not for anything I did. I did nothing more than give her an opportunity. She did all the work to get where she’s at. The point of this is to illustrate out that where you start isn’t indicative of where you’ll end up.

For example, I have a specific targeted behavior and my barrier is nothing more than a note that reads, “Don’t be stupid!!” It doesn’t have to take much, just that when I  confront it I must consider it. It’s not someone else telling me to not be stupid, it’s me telling it to myself. Now I can push right past it in the moment. It won’t eliminate me from engaging in the behavior.

Additionally the concept of religious faith is something I can’t reconcile. I’ve lived my entire life without it and feel no need for it. I do not hold a negative opinion of those that do, however. 
What I firmly do believe based on a lifetime of observation and some studying of human development and sociology is that as a social species all humans have an evolutionary need to feel valued and validated. Where we get them from can from from a wide variety of sources but we all seem to have this innate need for them."
BPD,ff8upg8,t3_es8ucf,1579696729.0,"Firstly I say that the blame isn’t one-sided. You may have some fault in it but it’s a two-way street. How you behave is your choice but you didn’t choose to have BPD. You may not know how to get better because you don’t have the skills to do so. Not knowing any means you have the ability to learn them. It’s only on you if you choose not to learn them or dismiss them outright. You can love. You have that capacity, but, in my opinion, I say to first try and love yourself. You may not feel it in this moment but you are deserving of love. You suffer from BPD but it does not define who you are.
Though I may have no hard evidence to support it, I am of the firm belief that as social beings and as a species we have an evolutionary need to feel valued and validated. You are worthy of it.

If you don’t have any DBT skills but are interested let me know and I’ll share my DBT Skills Manual with you. Side note, the skills aren’t only applicable to those with BPD but they can be equally beneficial to everyone."
BPD,ff8tgic,t3_es96x4,1579695459.0,Stereotypes are an emotional response to a generally observed behavior of a particular demographic. They are individualized by the person assigning the stereotype but they are an uninformed response. They are more reflective of that person than the target.

BPD,ff8sy55,t3_esaj5t,1579694894.0,"I’m on the opposite side of the spectrum. It may be helpful or not. That’s for you to decide. I don’t know anyone here personally and they don’t know me so how they feel about me is of no real consequence. In this subreddit all that is truly shared is a common ailment. My experiences, emotions, and behavior are my own. How people react to my posts is their decision and not reflective of me as a person so I don’t truly care. I post for me because it makes me feel good. If they get upvoted, sure it feels good and validating but if I get downvoted I don’t really care because I don’t carry any of it over when I’m not on Reddit. I have no emotional attachment. If I get downvoted or get an aggressively negative response I just roll my eyes and think they’re an idiot. Right or wrong it’s just how I am. Pleasantly debative responses I don’t mind because whether or not I agree with them there can be some benefit because they may offer a different perspective I hadn’t considered and I rather enjoy a good debate. Take this response with a grain of salt if it’s of no benefit. It is simply my experience."
BPD,ff8rjmf,t3_es7rhg,1579693224.0,"Here’s some skills that may help:

- Observe and describe your emotions and behavior.

I also locked myself away in my room with the blackout curtains drawn and light never on. Reflecting back I don’t think it was entirely bad per se. The vacation from people had some benefits but the length of it was excessive and the behavior long term has as many cons as pros. It’s not as beneficial as I think it is and it puts a strain on my relationships with others.
BPD,ff8q7hc,t3_es9hie,1579691447.0,"I still go to 11 on the reg but I’ve significantly curtailed the extreme outbursts. Like you, I’ve never been physical. I will not break from that because I find it utterly reprehensible. I’ve struggled with anger issues as long as I can remember. I don’t feel remorse (I don’t have the capability) rather I get upset at myself for violating my strict code of decorum. One thing I’ve learned in therapy is that it’s okay to get angry but my behavior is a choice that I alone make and that’s what I have to work on if I want to change it. DBT has taught me that when I have the urge to have an outburst that instead of going immediately to it to instead first take a step back to evaluate and consider if my outburst would be appropriate and beneficial. What would it solve? What is my motivation? How would I feel upon reflecting afterward? It’s not easy at first because it’s what you’re used to doing so it takes practice. But this simple added step, at least for me, has helped tremendously. I can still have outbursts but I’ve slowly raised the threshold to a much higher degree that for small shit it’s no longer my initial reaction and I’m unlikely to have one.

The DBT program I’m in is built around her manual and we use it in both my individual and group therapy sessions. I was even able to get a copy of it in pdf form so I can have it on my phone to pull it up and reference it on the go when I need it. The great thing about it is that the skills can apply to anyone and I’ve been giving it out to friends and family when I hear they’re going through anxiety and/or depressive periods. 

If anyone wants a pdf copy just DM me."

politics,faflkqz,t1_faeev9v,1576025827.0,My dad is primarily the reason I blocked it. He’s a privileged conservative Boomer and it’s terribly unfortunate to see that channel rot his brain. We try to avoid political discussions because I’m quite critical of his uninformed opinions. That’s the worst part. His opinions are woefully uninformed and based on Fox opinion shows. There’s no critical thinking and no verification of facts. I can’t even call it confirmation bias for him because it isn’t. It’s just pure ignorance. But he’s been indoctrinated his whole life so he just accepts what he hears from them as legitimate.

BPD,fa8mkyo,t1_fa85r74,1575849710.0,FP hasn’t come up once as a term in my DBT group or individual therapy. I’ve only seen it used outside of therapy. I use codependent because that’s what I see it as.

Her behavior doesn't match up with any PTSD symptoms I've encountered but I don't know all of her symptoms or if she has any other ailments, diagnosed or not, contributing to the behavior. Having spent the greater part of the last two decades around mental illness I have enough concern that I'd like to see a mental health professional evaluate her so she can get the appropriate help."
