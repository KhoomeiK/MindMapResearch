The gallbladder is essentially a “holding tank” of bile and it releases a small amount any time you eat. When you have it removed, there’s no more “container” to hold it and your body releases too much and that can cause diarrhea. For the majority of people that subsides within a few months. A small percentage of people’s bodies never really adjust (like me) and you can develop chronic diarrhea. I also developed IBS afterwards but I don’t know if that was a direct correlation."
