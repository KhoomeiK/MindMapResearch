This one comes with a story

Back during highschool, there was a guy at a different school that used to harass me (small town), he did lots of gross things and most of them pretty perverted and nasty, he and his friends would come to bully me when walking home and he got my phone number through other kids and sent me texts and called me all the time just to harass me and make me mad. Eventually I got him to stop when I was walking down the street and saw him alone and without his other friends for the first time and I confronted him and warned him against doing it again. 

It stopped for a while but then he moved out of town and it started again. After highschool I went to a house party with some old friends, low and behold someone I barely knew invited him to the same party. We made eye contact and he sunk into his seat. I walked over to my friend (the one throwing the party) and told him either he leaves or I leave I dont care which one. 

My friend doesnt like conflict so he said he hadnt done anything wrong at the party so he didnt want to just kick him out, so I said fine by me I'm leaving. As I was walking out from the basement just FUMING mad at just the sight of this guy he stands up in front of me blocking my way out and says ""hey man we were just young dumb and full of cum right?"" I fucking knocked him on his ass right there I just went blank with rage. I got pulled off of him and people basically dragged me outside. Afterwards I just turned and started going home again.

I'm normally a pretty tame person, I never fought with anyone and everyone at the party enjoyed my presence and no one ever had any kind of conflict with me but they never knew the story between me and that guy. I guess they cleaned him up asked him what he did to me cause no one had ever seen me that angry before and told him he better leave in case I decide to come back.

Never seen that guy again. Hopefully for good."

fucking terrified of what was to happen I told my parents who then called the police.

They were fighting an undead beholder as a sort of mini boss, I was rolling for the random eye ray and was pretty consistently getting the paralyzing ray. 

The beholder is sitting at one health, had come back twice with undead fortitude when I rolled paralyzing ray once more and aimed at the blood hunter (the player character) and then he says to me ""are you gonna roll paralyzing rays the whole time? Roll it again""

I proceeded to ask ""are you sure?"" 4 times and everytime he said yes, so I rolled again, it was the only time I rolled a disintegrating ray during the whole fight. His max HP was 49, and that's exactly the amount of damage I did. He was instantly dusted, and that same turn the wizard became unparalyzed and finally killed the undead beholder. 

As far as I'm concerned, he asked to be killed. He is a good sport and we all had a good laugh about it but he challenged the dice gods and they told him no."
