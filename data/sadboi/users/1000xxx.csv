I find that although religious people don‚Äôt agree fully with religions other than their own, what really sets them off is someone who just doesn‚Äôt believe in anything at all.

Kind of in relation to this, I remember when I was younger, about 14 or 15, I tried my last time (before ultimately becoming an atheist) to build a relationship with god. I remember going to youth group, church, and praying everyday, often in tears asking for god to talk to me. I would even ask people ""how do you know god talks to you?"" And everyone I asked could not give me a clear answer. And I was starting to feel that I either couldn‚Äôt hear God because I wasn‚Äôt listening or God was testing my faith. I mean the latter would be pretty manipulative. ""Let me see if I don‚Äôt talk to her if she‚Äôll still believe in me or give up on her faith.‚Äù But fast forward a little later in high you know after questioning my beliefs and now I am an atheist.

exchristian,f6fbp7k,t1_f6ac9jv,1572812585.0,">What's crazy is at the time you convince yourself it's actually good for you to feel that way

I know! Often if I questioning why I should fear God, I would often repeat what I was told by my church and family that man should fear God. I couldn't understand why someone should have to fear a divine being who apparently loves us all. But I felt like there could be a hidden truth to it so I continued to fear God in the way I thought I should which was constant repenting of my sins, praying, and worrying. 

I also struggled with self harm and while I personally didn't do it because of feel un-okay with myself due to toxic religious beliefs, I think my mental health was one step to moving away from God when I realized that praying and being saved wasn't saving me. It's crazy because I remember writing all these letters to God begging him to make me happy an to make my life good because people told me ""Jesus saves."" It was so liberating when I rebelled against that. And although my life wasn't perfect afterwards, having an open mind definitely improved my perspective on life. So grateful for that."

I knew in the back of my head it didn't make sense and that I lot of the damaging beliefs I were being told such as those regarding homosexuality and sex were not right. Yet, I was so young and wanted to remain innocent because I felt bad for questioning it and probably didn't know if I would be able to live a life without it so that's why these weird phases/behaviours happened a lot."

sleep,ezwiq8z,t1_ezua4ts,1568217605.0,"Yeah I hate that too.

depression,ezswmzm,t3_d1z3jp,1568113231.0,"The first part of your message sounded like me! Being 18 and looking at all these people and how they buzzed along in their lives always with something to do as if their life‚Äôs purpose with their motor, while I felt so incredible lost. I think it was a combination of an existential crisis and depression. It was my first year of uni. I not only was questioning myself and life, but I felt numb and was failing to see why anything matter. My mental got a lot worse by second year and my grades suffered badly.

Definitely one thing I am happy I did: I didn‚Äôt give up. After that year, I had the best summer of my life. My grades got better and slowly I‚Äôm tatted to pick up the pieces again. No, I‚Äôm not necessarily better now. I still have moments. Just a couple weeks ago I made a post here. 

I took a looked at your profile (I swear I am not stalking lol) and you said in one post you were 18 which was the age when I felt lost and I was dealing with similar feelings at the time. 

You have so much time to heal and to grow. And you will grow whether you like it or not! Your brain is still developing. Both me and you are so young we are basically babies!

Seek some help if you need to. If you‚Äôre in school, see if there‚Äôs a counselling centre you can go to. You can talk about anything. Breakups or depression. It‚Äôs for anybody. Also, see a GP if you‚Äôve had feelings of depression for a while. Take care of yourself OP!"

Day by day though like you said. I‚Äôm trying to be positive. Something as simple as doing a load of laundry can feel productive. 

I guess what makes it hard is comparison. Seeing how others can accomplish so much in such little time. Seeing my peers have more opportunities granted to then because of that. It can be hard.

selfimprovement,ewuiq1q,t3_cq8a5a,1565782573.0,"I think this isn't an overnight thing and requires you understanding yourself and others too. One, is you have to view the criticism objectively. For example, if my boss yells at me for something I wasn't even doing, my reaction as I human is to get upset for her to even accuse me, but I first analyze the situation and if there was any accuracy to it. If there was not, I think about why she might be lashing out at me and realize she is likely stressed and on her toes and feels like she is losing control and needs to control others. However, I try not to get too hung up on why someone might have said what they said because it doesn't matter. What matters is if it was their own personal matter or legitimate criticism. In some cases, you may be able to ask them to explain more. If they seem to be emotional and going in circles, it is usually something to do with themselves and not you. 

Also, if there are people who are always screwing you over and making you upset, you need to ask yourself if you really want these people in you life. You don't have to stick around people who make you feel like shit. 

I think just working in retail for 3 years too has shown me that while there are the sweetest people in this world, there are also people who are just inherently miserable and will treat people like shit for no reason.  And the fact that some people you just can't make happy and it isn't your job to. That is just the reality of the world. Just be kind and respectful to everyone regardless."

I remember before my eating disorder, I thought dieting was good. Hell, I thought it was virtuous or one of those ultimate life goals to pursue weight loss. And many, many people do. Even now after my eating disorder, despite some relapses, I still find is disorienting to think of who I was at that time because it was like I was another person.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love her and understand her concern considering her upbringing and the fact she never had acne.

menstrualcups,eufatur,t1_euf9z4k,1563767765.0,"Oh no! It takes me about two minutes right now since I‚Äôm new to cups and want to ensure it‚Äôs open. You might want to push it bit higher if it‚Äôs not opening. Also, I find that my cup kind of has to be be pointed to the side to get to stay open. I find running my finger around the rim helps too! Some people do a full 360 turn to get it to open. The internet might have better answers on how to get it to open. Keep trying!"
menstrualcups,eueq4pk,t1_eudixfn,1563750861.0,That‚Äôs awesome! What kind of kettle do you use?
menstrualcups,eueq271,t1_eue0i9g,1563750808.0,Yikes I‚Äôd hope that‚Äôs not the case. But wouldn‚Äôt that be painful if it was? And I think I would feel it being pulled off my cervix when I take it out. I thought it was just because of how I pinch it causing it to spill inside of me.Maybe I should have measured my cervix before getting the cup.
menstrualcups,euepv7z,t1_eueed4f,1563750655.0,Hmm well maybe lube would help! I may buy one for my next cycle and see how it works. Thanks!
menstrualcups,euepr78,t1_eue8uj9,1563750567.0,Yes I also thought it would be messy and I know that mucus string you are talking about! I am starting to slowly get less messy with it but I am still finding it hard to do when the cup is quite full.
menstrualcups,eudh1m3,t1_eudfpcz,1563717090.0,"I use the diva cup wash in between washes. It works great and I got it on sale so yay. I like boiling it between washes. It isn't hard for me to find a time to do it when nobody is around, at least for now haha. I could just imagine it being annoying for people in larger households and, again around people who stigmatize periods. Somebody brought up using a kettle and I think that is a great idea too.

For pantyliners, I am going to look into both reusable panytliners and those light flow thing undies. Also as for discharge, sometimes I just change my  underwear during the day it gets too much for me haha, but somebody with heavier discharge this probably isn't option."
menstrualcups,eudeq1z,t1_eucqahk,1563714861.0,Thank you and congrats on your first time using it! I think that's the other cool thing about the cup is you get to actually see and learn how much you bleed.
menstrualcups,eudejj3,t1_eucqz68,1563714677.0,"Yes, I will soon be getting rid of these! Just using up the ones I have left before I choose more eco-friendly options. I noticed these and pads can cause irritation for me as well."
menstrualcups,eudehu7,t1_eucu6h7,1563714629.0,I have never even though of a kettle! Thank you!
menstrualcups,eudeevo,t1_eucumic,1563714545.0,"Yeah that was my concern so thank you for telling me that! I would love to find one that's higher capacity and similar to the lunette because that cup has worked pretty well with my body. 

The baby wipes is a good tip, but I still may have to wear them for potential leaking since I have dealt with that."
menstrualcups,eude7tk,t1_eucxi04,1563714344.0,"I may look into lubricant, but it hasn't been entirely necessary for me! Usually if it's nice and wet and I have it folded down well, it doesn't hurt. But lubricant might make the process easier.

Also, I was going to use alternate methods like vinegar or hydrogen peroxide to sanitize, but on the manufacturer's website it says these method could degrade the silicone."
menstrualcups,eucnpwv,t1_eucmoy8,1563680553.0,I should try it! I have a day left in my cycle to use it so I will try tomorrow  to see if that helps. Thanks!
menstrualcups,eucnmif,t1_eucnaj9,1563680467.0,"Yes! I sometimes wait to insert the cup so my next cycle I am going to try inserting it immediately to see how that helps. Also, I am considering getting a higher capacity cup. Although I know most cups can hold 15 ml of blood, it seems I can only allow half of it to be filled because my grip when pulling it out pushing blood up inside me. And yeah I probably just gave a heavier flow than I thought haha!"
tarot,eu82b3b,t1_eu71zez,1563548193.0,"Haha! Tarot just wants to help, even if it‚Äôs an a tough live kind of way. I did a additional reading today for each card using an oracle deck called the dark goddess oracle and pulled the goddess nemetona is represented by secrecy. So I think a lot of this card is definitely represented by emotions and not properly expressing my emotions or feeling them and also isolating myself in the intense emotions I have been experiencing."
tarot,eu82114,t1_eu7r3n8,1563548024.0,This is also a great interpretation! Thank you
tarot,eu6rszg,t1_eu6qrud,1563507380.0,"I can definitely see diligence and hard work being apart of this. Like posting on a consistent basis and trying to connect with my audience and other influencers. As for page of swords, i see it kind of as a lacking experience card but having the youthfulness that incites intelligence and creativity to eagerly get something done. I think that‚Äôs why it goes well with Knight if pentacles because i think it is showing that is more about consistency and putting the work in when branding yourself rather than just putting yourself in a niche.

And no this is not let‚Äôs play although that would probably be fun! Thanks for the help with the interpretation!"
tarot,eu6rcer,t1_eu5x3pe,1563507045.0,Hmm I could definitely see this too! Thank you for the interpretation
tarot,eu6qjxk,t3_cd2cju,1563506486.0,"Hey everyone. Today I did I quick card pull regarding Instagram. I asked my card two questions:

What is my niche: page of swords

How do I get into it: knight of pentacles

I‚Äôd really appreciate help interpreting this, thanks!"

tarot,eu4wxdx,t1_eu4uyxd,1563465042.0,"I think this could be true with my friend circle right now. I love them, but I feel for the past few months, we just haven't been ""vibing"" the way we once used to. Over the pat year of so, I felt very close to them and would tell them everything, and now I have been doing a lot of stuff independently. We still talk, but it's surface deep. A part of me wants to change, but another part wonders if I should let the universe take its course because I cannot force people to be close to me. And regarding fear of being alone, yeah that's very true. I feel like these people are the people I have been closest to in my entire life and we have had many spiritual connections and moments with each other. But, I need support. I need people I feel connected to. Even if if it is just one or two people. Surface deep conversation is okay sometimes, but it can't fulfill me. 

Sorry for this blabber. I guess you saying that really triggered something I have already been thinking about so thank you for bringing this to light. It helps."
tarot,eu4qlvj,t3_cetcj8,1563460927.0,"I am using the rider Waite tarot deck. The question I asked my cards today is ""what 3 habits can I start doing to doing to be a better person?""

 I drew wheel of fortune reversed, five of swords and page of cups.

My interpretation:

Wheel of fortune reversed: I need to give myself the authority to take control of my own life and do the things I know are going to help and to put my fate in my own hands. I think this is true because I feel like for a large part of my life I need validation in some form that what I am doing is ""right"" for someone my age or something like that. It‚Äôs the reason I watch so many lifestyle videos like vlogs and morning routines. They can be good to inspire you, but they can be kind of damaging if you are looking for some way to make your life feel normal or to compare yourself, your life, your productivity, etc. to another person. 

I think it‚Äôs also a reminder to steer away from negative thoughts because of the negative cycles they have put me in before. As a reminder that they are vicious and will have me trapped in the more I engage in them. 

Five of swords: this five of swords card I think is to remind me to try not to withdraw my love too much from people just because I feeling my own insecurities like feeling nobody cares about me. Especially when I experience FOMO. You see in the picture that not only is the man holding two swords and his own, but there‚Äôs also two lying on the ground. This insinuates that two people he was battling have left or loss the fight. Being cold, withdrawn, and short in response will not do anything for me. It only pushes people away from me and hurts other people.

Page of cups reversed: I need to stop doubting my intuition and to just start engaging in things for the sake of keeping my creative fire alive. I often doubt myself or think ""what‚Äôs the point? What if it doesn‚Äôt turn out the way I want it to?"" Who cares. If you let your emotions and head keep talking you out of doing things you want to try, you will end up unhappy. And of course, it‚Äôs better to try than to die wondering what would happen if you did. When I see this card, I imagine this man just taking the cup and dipping it into the ocean and capturing a fish. You know the quote, ""there are plenty of fish in the sea?"" I see this card as the man proving to himself that there are plenty of opportunities, you just need to start and choose the one your heart feels drawn to."
tarot,ettx9m2,t1_ettw2ab,1563198703.0,"Goodness, this is making kind of emotional right now... To get that and then ace of swords was just like a reality check slapped in my face. I feel like I have so much to re- evaluate. Thank you so much for the insights!!! I will likely do a follow up spread to see how I can ""put this pedal to the metal"" and follow my heart."
tarot,ettucmu,t3_cd2cju,1563196269.0,"Hi fellow tarot enthusiasts! Today i did a spread about going back to school in the fall and am trying to interpret what I got. 

For the likely outcome of going back to school i got the moon and 9 of cups reversed. 

For the likely outcome of taking a break and reconsidering things I got ace of swords. 

I would appreciate any help interpreting this! Thanks!"
SkincareAddiction,etsz2ft,t1_etrotht,1563159551.0,I think you might be right! I have noticed the past few days that the area around my nose has been dry. I kind of took a skincare break and was just cleansing my face and applying sunscreen and it didn‚Äôt burn when I did it this time tonight! A bit tingly but nothing major or concerning. Thanks!
SkincareAddiction,etqu3w3,t3_ccyqha,1563102294.0,"Whenever I put my cerave moisturizer (the one that comes in a tub) on my face after I have applied my TO gycilic acid, their is a burning sensation around my new and eye area (my sensitive areas).
