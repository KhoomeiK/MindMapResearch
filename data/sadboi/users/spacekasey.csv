Anyways I went to his hometown of Rivne to visit his parents.  His dad actually missed the Soviet Union and said as much to me while I was there.  Also played “Go West” by Pet Shop Boys before dinner; specifically a fan video that was ONLY real footage of Soviet armies marching 

Wild shit. He made a great borscht though."

Just placed a 180 order and they substituted 2 items (for actually decent substitutes) and were out of four small items. Not too bad. I wish there was a way to quickly pick something else before picking up my order, like since they were out of pork chops I could have asked for a different protein, but it’s no big deal. Ordering has been so easy (and pick up too) that I’ll just schedule another order four or five days out for what I need. I don’t like Walmart obviously, but it’s working for me not going in to the store."
BPD,fnpi1ug,t3_g30neu,1587145868.0,"Yeahhhhhhhhh. 

I’ve found myself thinking of my ex boyfriend daily - overthinking what happened to us. How he had lied about dumb things and I lost trust and became distant just as he was really starting to fall in love and understand his mistakes. How mean I was to him at the end when he began to do really sweet things and yearn for my approval and how quickly I tried to move on. One night during a fight (we were both drunk and not as in control of our selves, he had yet to start therapy) he said “all you’ll ever be is a killer” and I had to end it. (I worked in a shelter and had done a lot of painful euthanasia lately. He really hit my nerve.)

Now, almost three whole years later, I feel more understanding and have grown out of the little strange place I was in, I feel more alive and in control of myself and my reactions and I miss the best friend I ever had. If he hadn’t moved out of state with his new girlfriend already I’m sure I’d have tried to rekindle things. He started therapy as soon as we ended. I’d always wished he’d started sooner and it made me mad way back then. Now, I’m just proud of him. Idk. We chat friendly like. A long time ago he told me “it’s weird - I don’t think anyone will ever be as warm to me as you were”. And I’m so sad I turned cold on him when he needed me. 

ANYWAYS. Yeah. I’m lonely as fucking hell and that’s always been my whole thing; my family was never there and I hate being lonely but it feels I always end up that way 🤷🏻‍♀️

I still feel like we’ll all be fine and there’s some kind of order to the chaos. Take solace knowing we’re all on this boat together."
