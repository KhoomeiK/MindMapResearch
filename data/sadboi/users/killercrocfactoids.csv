She would repeatedly come in my room and force my shirt over my shoulders and say “I know you secret” (she is literally the most dramatic person in the world) one day we were playing with a puppy and it scratched her so my parents said it looks like she cut her self, and I said no she didn’t I was there when it happend. So she decided hey why not lift his shirt off his shoulders now, in front of not only my parents but my parents friends so I pushed her away. She then told my parents that I have huge cuts on my shoulder and they still haven’t said anything about it."

No but seriously I understand the fear but I try to think of it as a nap without a dream, I feel like comparing it to something more common in daily activity’s helps cope with the idea of there being nothing, but if it really scares you just think about what you’re doing in the present and live for that, instead of worrying about something so far away when you have your whole life to enjoy."
