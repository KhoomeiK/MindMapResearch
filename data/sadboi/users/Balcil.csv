If you identify as non-binary, then I suggest the metrosexual styles of K-Pop stars. Most male K-Pop stars have a mix of femininity and masculinity."
BrainFog,ffwgy8d,t1_ffvp1y9,1580300643.0,It is something I am considering for obesity. So I heavily researched. It fixes your gut bacteria. OP was thinking the antibiotic might work because it affects the gut bacteria. So that is why I suggested it. I would not normally suggest it otherwise unless you have reason to believe that your gut bacteria is affecting your brain fog. It is not researched enough to know if it is effective for mental illness and mood disorders.

AskCulinary,ffvhjxx,t1_ffv3xuy,1580264267.0,"Higher food chain fish(and other animals) are more subject to the build up of toxins(bio accumulation). Think mercury 

Here is an example with easy numbers. This is somewhat simplified. 

1 amount of toxin is in each krill. Each salmon eats one hundred of krill, so it gets a 1 * 100 toxin. Each tuna eats one hundred of salmon and other fish, so tuna gets 1 * 100 * 100 toxin. A smaller shark eats one hundred tuna, so the small shark gets 1*100*100*100 toxin."

MakeupAddiction,ffuuvip,t1_ffu8212,1580249783.0,Some oils can irritate the skin around the eyes. I am not familiar with other oils to know enough about them. Although olive oil is not nearly as bad as coconut. Also jojoba oil can be used. But that is not something most people have laying around unless it is for skin care.
MakeupAddiction,fftex6o,t1_ffsxjxw,1580218571.0,"I see feminism as a desire for everyone to be equal regardless of your gender. I HATE radical feminism that is against men and/or transgender. I literally consider you female because according to science your brain is female. The brain is what matters not your body.

I live in the south so I see a lot of people who don’t understand and are ruled by the fear of what they do not understand. I am cis female, by the way"
MakeupAddiction,ffte8bz,t1_ffta237,1580217967.0,"Practice and just plain play around. Your face is your canvas. Literally set aside a few hours and just play around. And take it off afterwards. I also like to play around with special effects makeup/Halloween makeup. I think turning myself into a zombie has helped me know what not to do.

Everyday makeup should be kept simple, at least at first. Pick a few items to use. I tend to do mascara, lipstick, and sometimes eyeliner. I might use foundation, but just in areas that are red or darker or lighter then the rest of the face. 

To remove, use coconut oil or olive oil. This is a natural remover that is also good for your skin. This works on most makeup, including waterproof."
