BPD,fr216pl,t3_gm65st,1589829386.0,Sometimes I'm scared to make plans because I don't want people to cancel on me. I often make excuses to not go. Yesterday my friends invited me to lunch in the late afternoon and I had a million excuses in my head as to why I couldn't since I had to be at work at 6.I dont like to live my life like this not feeling close to other people.  Instead of making an excuse and sitting at home I got my house clean and lunch made for my bf before I left the house to meet my friends. Win win situation for everyone. Don't miss those precious moments in life to feel close to others. They don't come back
progresspics,fqxjtg4,t3_glcc11,1589733404.0,Wow your skin!! Keep it up:)
BPD,fqw1wh5,t3_gl6xfh,1589690584.0,I did this SEVERAL times.  The last time I was proud that I actually called it off. People who gave me uncertainty and anxiety used to peak my interest. It was like savoring bitter wine on my tongue. When you really need to change you will. I got to the point that I really just wanted someones love and couldn't chase anymore.
BorderlinePDisorder,fqw1pae,t1_fqv5rzv,1589690434.0,Thanks :) yes it's really important to do this for yourself. I never realized how important it is to enjoy the little things in life. They are actually quite big. I had a huge epiphany eating chocolates and crying . I don't know how to explain it but it was one of the most beautiful moments in my life.
BorderlinePDisorder,fqt38y5,t3_gkfgcp,1589628494.0," About 6 months ago I was eating very poorly. I think our relationship with food is a huge reflection of self love and worth.  I used to go to the store and just buy the cheapest things or whatever was on sale. I never went into the store thinking about getting myself something that I felt like eating.  I never bought sweets or anything that cost more than a couple dollars. I also ate 1 time a day maybe 2. I often forgot to drink water and just filled up on coffee at work.  
     I had just met my boyfriend and he pointed out to me that I smoked more than I ate or drank water. My body really didn't look too nice but at the time I didnt realize it. He started making me eat really often always taking me places and buying me chocolate.  He taught me how to love myself more in that way. I gained some weight but that's inevitable when you arent eating enough. 
   So I want to encourage you to treat yourself. What sounds really good to you? Go out and buy yourself a nice coffee and whatever you want to eat. Enjoy the sun and really taste the food. Take your time in the moment.  Don't think about food like matinence."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fqt1647,t3_gklaj8,1589626379.0,I'm very picky about restaurants.  I definitely feel like the places I frequent are worth it. If something cost more than $15 per person then it better be some braziallian steak or a freshly caught fish.
BPD,fqlm906,t3_gjfzwi,1589461555.0,"  I think my mom has bpd for sure. I also did suffer some abuse and separation from my father. She said from a young age that when she would just tell me ""Don't do that "" in a stern voice that I would loose my shit and be sad for hours and she would have to reassure me that everything was fine. I also had a reoccurring dreams of being abandoned or forgotten by my family since elementary school (before the abused happened at 8yo)
   Now after loosing someone really important to me I was able to find out the problem. 
    This sub helps me though. When people talk about their problems I can see ""wow that thinking is so unreasonable "" and I can see more clearly how I do the same things. I also don't particularly like hopeless posts. Sometimes these people need help though. They really feel helpless. 
    Every day I'm fighting and challenging negative thoughts and fears that I'm not truly loved and preparing to be betrayed and when I feel myself going into a episode I get on here and just start reading."
BPD,fqjkfsy,t1_fqd7c4r,1589411209.0,"Sadly our loved ones blocking and unfollowing people is never enough.  At least for me I'll just put something else under a microscope. I told my bf today that I feel like I'm not a good looking as some of the beautiful women he's following and that I know its normal for me to look at beautiful women but I dont want him to want someone else more than me and then he just said ""you're beautiful and I love you"" that made me feel better for now lol. I feel stupid always after I vocalize these thoughts"
BPD,fqe4v91,t1_fqd7hep,1589301785.0,It's a nasty feelings often it brings me to tears either because of the idea that my paranoia is right or because I know that I'm not right and yet I still have to work hard to argue with myself before I say or do something I dont mean. I have to challenge these ideas until i convince myself I'm just overthinking.  Anytime i act on these suspicions I regret it completely and feel really embarrassed.
BPD,fqcmvm5,t3_gi3isg,1589262546.0,"I never feel jealous of another person's success but in relationships I'm extremely jealous. For example if my boyfriend is following a pretty girl and it's not someone I know I irritates me and I always check to see if he likes her pictures and it makes me really mad. 
   When he doesn't answer my messages right away but I see him on Instagram I start to get paranoid that he compares me to other women."
intermittentfasting,fqcmodb,t1_fqcf6k6,1589262381.0,I had a friend who was always skinny until he started eating like 5 meals a day mostly lean protein
intermittentfasting,fqcdh8p,t3_gi3f6m,1589255560.0,I wouldn't even do intermittent fasting if you want to gain weight. Eat more carbs. Maybe do some potatoes and chicken in the bone broth.
Hair,fq3n3vg,t3_ggfwhu,1589068078.0,Change the style and make it shorter! But still keep it long. EVERY girl I know regrets it when they chop it into a Bob and look at old pictures. My best friend went through this.
BPD,fpzyh19,t1_fpzube5,1589025540.0,"Yes it's been really nice to find this board. Sometimes when I feel like I'm freaking out I start to just read through everything and it really makes me feel like ""wow this is a real thing "". I have tried to explain it but it is really hard for other people to understand. Sometimes I feel like people tell me things like I'm stupid or like it's a easy fix.  It certainly hasn't been easy. My mom even told me that when she would correct my behavior as a child that I would cry alot and need to be comforted for hours in the rocking chair just loosing my shit kinda feel the same just adult sized."
BPD,fpzuz68,t1_fpzrwgf,1589024054.0,Sounds like nothing now but it feels like forever when i thought about dying everyday.
BPD,fpzu9i9,t1_fpzcppu,1589023740.0,Yeah I don't bring it up as often as I should. I am always surprised by how receptive he is because I expect that he will get mad but he only gets mad when I'm ugly or treat him like he did something to cause the jealousy. He has a very healthy mindset towards most things.  I am really ungrateful of that in the moments that I look for something to hold against him.
BPD,fpzsvcs,t1_fpymeg2,1589023097.0,Do you feel that doing a dbt workbook is anywhere close to talking to a therapist?
BPD,fpzsj40,t1_fpyp72i,1589022905.0,Yes even this morning he had to work early and i woke up too and he told me to go back to sleep and I felt like he didnt want to see me or he wanted privacy for some reason. And I was so convinced for that and he said it was just out if respect and wanting me to rest. He's a really nice guy and I keep living in my past with a new person. Its not fair but I dont know how to move on. I still feel hurt by all that happened before.
BPD,fpzrvzr,t1_fpy68qg,1589022597.0,"Thanks for your help and recommendations.  I will definitely ready these. About a year ago I think I was completely out of control, in denial of a problem, using alot of different drugs. It took about 6 months after stopping the drugs to get my actions under control but I was still crying for hours every day. I read a dbt workbook and that has helped alot with self control but the emotions and thoughts are still a daily thing. The crying is less but still often enough to see a problem."
BPD,fpy0ce9,t1_fpxvwd4,1588993279.0,I'm afraid of being left behind and forgotten. It's always been my fear from a young age. I had a reoccurring dream of my family forgetting I existed. It actually did happen with another guy. Just disappeared because he didn't want to deal with me and married another woman. If that happens again I'm not sure I can handle it.
BPD,fpy04x5,t1_fpxzq18,1588993158.0,I'm scared to admit just how jealous I am.  I dont want to lose another person because of jealousy:/ I know you're right. I still havent ever been to therapy I've just been trying to take control of my actions but the thoughts are all still there. Have you done therapy??
BPD,fpxqnp2,t1_fpxikd1,1588987627.0,I did express my jealousy very much at first because I couldn't control myself but I think I'm more scared of losing him due to my jealousy to another woman. I talked to him about it about my fears and irrationality luckily he tries to understand but I'm afraid to express that jealousy anymore.
BPDmemes,fpohlej,t1_fpnvm66,1588784630.0,I've definitely completely lost people in my life due to my behavior. I havent ever gone to therapy but I do feel like I'm getting better at times. The hard part for me is trust. Even if someone didnt do anything to loose my trust my brain wants to trick me into being suspicious.  Or I start just splitting because of the smallest thing I just try to recognize what's happening and not act on first thoughts and assumptions.  It has to be done right away though or it becomes really hard to control a emotional reaction  because it just builds more and more.
intermittentfasting,fpnh5im,t1_fpn7kcr,1588762719.0,About 3 weeks! This is my 4th week and I've not lost anything this week but hoping I will somehow pull through with a little something!
BPDmemes,fpmu6so,t3_gea5zz,1588741835.0,I think I may have broken this! I havent scared my boyfriend off yet. He's amazing.  I share with him how I feel and that I know its irrational and he brings me back to reality and sets healthy boundaries .
intermittentfasting,fpmtqtv,t1_fplkn4d,1588741492.0,💪Thanks!
intermittentfasting,fpmtp24,t1_fpld1cd,1588741454.0,"No actually I never thought about that either! But I definitely would be allowed to if I brought some they just provided masks, gloves, and sanitizing supplies."
intermittentfasting,fplc4kc,t1_fpl81mz,1588710072.0,I just drink water and eat salt packets I probably look like such a weirdo lol! Honestly I feel pretty full after 2 large meals i feel like if i did it that it's too much. We have had 20+ cases but they cracked down on ppe and social distancing.  They write people up within 6ft of eachother!
intermittentfasting,fplap7g,t1_fpl81mz,1588709341.0,When I feel dizzy I just drink water and eat salt packets. I probably look like such a weirdo. I'm really getting used to it! I feel pretty full after having 2 big meals. Yeah we are going through temperature checks and have to wear masks.  There has been over 20 cases in my warehouse so far:0
intermittentfasting,fpl7dpj,t1_fpl6spm,1588707676.0,I eat from 12-5! I work overnight in a warehouse so I walk alot and I think that helps since I'm not eating while I'm there. On my days off I give myself a bigger window like 1-9.
intermittentfasting,fpkzn6m,t1_fpkvhvd,1588703796.0,Thanks! I was feeling myself today I am down 8lbs !
intermittentfasting,fpkpbnt,t1_fpkmfnz,1588698695.0,"Yeah sometimes it's best to just lay low and wait till everyone asks you "" what did you do?!"""
intermittentfasting,fpkm5vf,t3_ge0bxq,1588697135.0,I've definitely had people tell me IF isn't healthy and 95% of the time that person is overweight and not happy about anyone's progress.
intermittentfasting,fpklora,t1_fpjzv6h,1588696901.0,That sounds good! Kinda like tomato soup?
intermittentfasting,fpipseu,t1_fpighr5,1588646032.0,Lmao right you could make a soup I guess. I just like the seaweed crunchy. I drink a cup of the broth and have about 4 small squares of the seaweed. So far following these rules I lost 8lbs in like 3 weeks even eating carbs and nutella later in the feeding period. I've been doing 18/6 and a couple days a week 12/12. I like to do 24hr fast1 time a week. I'm still learning but so far so good! I could probably loose more weight if I ate even more clean .
intermittentfasting,fpiflb4,t1_fpicjau,1588639894.0,I add a little pink salt cause it kinda taste weird without it and yep sometimes with some seaweed but obviously don't put the seaweed inside.
intermittentfasting,fpifhju,t1_fphi42z,1588639834.0,Actually I feel like it really had made my hair grow sooo fast too
intermittentfasting,fphf57d,t1_fphbqq9,1588620185.0,It's high in protein! Also low carb and low calorie. The body is the most sensitive to the first thing you put in the body. Just protein is best. About 30 mins later I will eat like forreal!
intermittentfasting,fphc16c,t1_fphbu8g,1588618592.0,Yeah I dont think you need to really count the calories as long as you know you're not having too many carbs. I just use my blender and put some ice and water and it's like a frozen drink! It's really delicious.
intermittentfasting,fphbbso,t1_fphatxz,1588618237.0,Ahh okay well that could be a problem. 1.) Its usually containing gluten which is really rough on the body after  a fast 2.) Its very high in carbs. Maybe try something low carb and high fat then 30 mins later eat whatever you want! I know you said you are veggie based I also like to break my fast with a chocolate pea protein shake.
intermittentfasting,fphakp0,t3_gdh5s0,1588617862.0,How do you break your fast?
intermittentfasting,fphah7u,t3_gdhdvy,1588617813.0,Wow! You look great!
BPD,fovyu77,t3_g9smkr,1588109932.0,"   For me personally the best way to know is to just ask someone uninvolved what they think about it. My emotional reaction is right! But my assumptions that make me have the reaction might not always be right. 
    I've been doing so good recently to let my emotions come however strong but not react until I'm calm. And it's okay to have discussions with people about the feelings I get and acknowledge that its extreme and just keep fighting. 
   It will all pass! Good luck to you my friend. I hope you have a wonderful day."
BorderlinePDisorder,fouj6rd,t1_fouigtk,1588085049.0,"Yes ofcourse sometimes I just want to escape how I used to by using drugs. Not gonna lie I still haven't finished the book but I've went far enough so that it helps me. I have alot of things I'm trying to do aside from check myself emotionally.  Right now my plan is just a couple small things. In the last 2 weeks I lost 8lbs so that makes me feel really good, I'm also slowly paying off my debt $2400. I try not to spend alot of time thinking further than that because it makes me stressed. As far as the emotions I let them come and dont fight them. I just keep telling myself ""you know the drill "" it WILL pass."
BorderlinePDisorder,fougtgp,t1_fougg2d,1588083802.0,"I never have been to therapy but I feel like I've come a long way with this book i really recommend to everyone here ""the dialectical behavior skills workbook"" . I couldn't afford therapy in the worst times of my life."
BorderlinePDisorder,foue1te,t1_fotriib,1588082269.0,Yeah I understand totally. I'm still trying to get a hold of the emotional roller coaster. Luckily in my new job this hasn't shown too much. I've made friends with all the employees and I just act silly when I'm sad and it wears off after a few hours.  It's really tough sometimes.  Are you in therapy?
BPD,foudu14,t3_g9jba3,1588082146.0,I understand how you feel. Right now I'm in the bathroom trying to regulate my emotions while my boyfriend just woke up to watch the news. Its important to remember in these moments to be grateful for everything I have. That also makes me cry but like a happy cry.
BorderlinePDisorder,fothxbf,t3_g97t2w,1588054455.0,"Remember your bills, pets, payday.  Before acting go to the restroom or focus on a task.  Breath deeply and try not to cry because it onsets more emotions.  If you are in customer service then make someone happy or have a small talk.  Utilize your peers to bring you back to reality. Conversations are everything.  Sometimes people tell you what you need to hear without you even expressing the extent of your feelings and problems."
BPD,foq0kzk,t1_fomgowf,1587978606.0,Yeah same before going to sleep I probably cry and get really happy like 3 times. Its hard to accept that this is what I have to deal with. I wish I just felt normal sometimes
BPD,fo77w5a,t3_g40uid,1587573770.0,"Wow that brought a little bit of the past back to me. That's really fucked but I'm proud of you for that self respect.  It's a hard lesson to learn.  I was once talking to a guy for over a year and in the end he told me that nobody wants to deal with my ""breakdowns "" and that he already had a child and didnt need another. I was madly in love with the guy and he said I scared him because I self mutilated and would have daily emotional breakdowns. Well after he completely ghosted me and got married I realized HE was the problem. I have a much better control of these reactions because I'm no longer in love with someone who gives me constant anxiety and uncertainty.  I no longer feel like I have to fight everything inside me to make someone care about me. I think if a person is a trigger then maybe they really are just toxic. We have hyper senses that sometimes take things too far and personal but it's an amazing gift when we dont distort it."
BPDmemes,fo76r6o,t3_g3zj3v,1587573216.0,I used to be really quiet when I was growing up. I never was shy but I just had very little interest in getting close to others until I was about 18 years old. I started being very social and outspoken. I genuinely love people and make friends everywhere I go. I'm the worst at keeping in touch. For example I wont read messages for weeks sometimes . The only person I respond to in a timely manner would be my boyfriend. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed with a ton of messages and I just dont feel like talking.
HaircareScience,fo5mevw,t3_g3x44h,1587529318.0,I'm telling you from my own experience having dark brown hair and bleaching it myself. Go to a professional. In the long term it could be cheaper than all the products you will buy to achieve the color you want and to repair the damage. It's taken me about 4 months to repair my hair since going to a professional.  He gave me a beautiful ombre and oil treatment since then I promised him I wont touch my own hair lol.
BPD,fnusc9f,t1_fnsiptn,1587269803.0,It has alot of good coping skills. Sometimes i feel some panic coming on and I remember some of the things that I established as grounding to reality. It's really hard to have trust or to not think of the worst like someone died because they didnt answer the phone.
BPD,fnsbxhm,t1_fns5o3v,1587218190.0,"Well I started reading this book that helps to bring me back to reality when I start to panic and think irrationally . It's called "" dialectical behavior skills workbook"". This has probably saved my relationship a few times."
BPD,fnsbn9m,t1_fns5o3v,1587217995.0,Lol wow sorry. Don't listen to me. I actually think you're doing really good with dealing with that. I wouldn't be able to handle it as well as you. Its true that in healthy relationships it requires some distance but I guess what is hard to see is the difference between is distance and drifting away.
BPD,fnrf88q,t3_g3hfdr,1587187163.0,It's pretty draining to try to make someone happy. Probably because it isn't possible. Maybe you've put him in a tough situation.  Distance doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't love you. But one thing I wish I knew in the past is self respect. Don't feel desperate for someones attention. If you don't have it get what you need from someone else.
BPD,fnres1l,t3_g3gxlb,1587186789.0,Don't confuse your instincts with bpd. Sounds like he's full of shit. Possibly cheating. Trust me no guy would be out at 2am if it wasnt for some ass. You need to stalk him one night. Pretend you are sleeping and follow him. Or just leave with no explanation. That would get his attention.
BPD,fnre3pj,t3_g3e3yp,1587186235.0,I went through this in the past. It still hurts because I didnt win. I lost I was the one who acted foolish and desperate. I lost all my will to live and cried for hours everyday for months. I regret not being a complete bitch to the guy when I had the chance to. I wish I loved myself enough to stop it ahead of time and demand the love and attention that I needed. You deserve to be happy. Remember that you deserve to be happy.
intermittentfasting,fnox9qv,t3_exbpfm,1587135340.0,"Your stomach is extremely sensitive after a fast. It's best to stick with lean protein. What I do is first drink cinnamon tea , then have some dried seaweed with a pea protein shake. There is some foods that should be avoided after fasting such as raw veggies, eggs, gluten, garlic, onions, carbs altogether really, and dairy.  Also never combine fats and carbs when breaking a fast."
glutenfree,fmzfb4h,t3_fy3ckw,1586518410.0,"I have a weird history with gluten. When I was in HS I started having extreme digestion issues, hives, went from 135lbs to 115lbs and burning intestines. I went gluten free after a visit to the gastroenterologist. I had a blood test for celiac and was inconclusive. Years later I tried to eat it again and it didnt do anything. So I had been eating gluten from 21yo to about a week ago (I'm 24). I now weigh 169lbs but still am size 5? Anyways my boyfriend noticed that when I eat gluten I get really irritable and when I was sleeping I was breathing really hard having a asthma attack. I stopped eating gluten and sense then my stomach just hurts all the time and it's like burning inside. It's like I can feel all the damage from the gluten.  It's almost as if when I ate gluten I was like high and numb. It's been really frustrating going GF again. I hope to feel better soon."
BPDmemes,f74ztjb,t3_du9zly,1573410317.0,I forget to eat and drink water for days sometimes lol. Then I crave disgustingly delicious foods and coffee. I look pretty good tho. ;)
