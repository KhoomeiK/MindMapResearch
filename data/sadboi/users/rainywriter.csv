It isn't something that can be controlled of course and I certainly felt more emotionally charged last night. But I just personally feeeel that if people want to be in this community, they should show care and support and not thoughtlessly downvote. I also noticed that my second post was immediately downvoted again which leads me to think that a specific person may have been trolling and I think they should leave the subreddit if they are going to mess with me or anyone."

relationship_advice,ficjzm3,t1_fiajf7t,1582349640.0,"I stated this in a previous comment but I'll say it again.

While standing up for him would be the right thing to do,  I believe it ispossible that her anxiety contributed to her inability to handle confrontation.

I'm not trying to justify her actions but at the same time I kind of am because I think empathy and understanding on her end and her legitimate illness (because, yes, mental disorders are a real illness).

I also think that OP is trying to heal the situation and not make it worse by focusing on that specific issue. I think that focusing on the fact that she feels inadequate and both of them affirming each other that this is the arrangement they want (if they both still do), would be more of a priority in their relationship than to fight over who didn't defend who.

OP also asked for ways to reassure his wife. And communicating that he appreciates everything she does and that he is happy to provide would be the way to go.

They can maybe go over ways to help her deal with confrontation in the future after the main issue is resolved."

I use to use pH balancing vaginal wash and it almost gave me PID. My gyno told me to use nothing but water and that has fixed the issue and I haven't had any issues with it since the years I've done this.

1) I trust professionals over Google.
2) Water is probably safer than any random commercial product with chemicals.
3) I'm not going to not wash my vagina at all since I clearly have a reaction to ""gyno approved"" vaginal wash. Water is better than nothing.
4) Why would I quit doing something that has given me the best results and no problems... Yet everything else I have tried has created medical issues.
5) Why is anyone focusing in on trying to give me advice on what to use on my vagina when the post wasn't really about that??? I have my vagina figured out and I'm happy.

BUT, they are two totally different experiences and chances are she doesn't feel as fragile as you may feel she is. Like, she probably feels safe with you and if you guys communicate, you really shouldn't feel bad or worry about it. Honestly. Because she also doesn't want to be looked at as damaged.
