depression_help,faohhbb,t3_ea650s,1576264450.0,"People don't realize that saying variations of ""your life is good, what do you have to be safe about"" Is so damaging. I know I don't want to feel sad, I know I would give anything to not feel sad anymore. But I just can't help it! Even though you haven't had a good time with antidepressants before, there are many kinds out there and it takes time to find the right fit. It's taken a long time to find the right dose and the right doctor. But it does happen. I'm sorry you are feeling so sad, I hope so so much that it lifts soon."
SuicideWatch,f91r6x2,t3_e37dqt,1574998717.0,"There is someone out there who will love you and care for you no matter what. I told my boyfriend the same, there is always going to be something, I can't help it. And he loves me despite this for many many years. I know there is someone for you. Don't lose hope, hold on to hope. It's all we have."

mentalhealth,f702a35,t3_dtv7se,1573323451.0,Hoping you can find someone who supports you. They are out there. Mental health problems are just like any other disease and should be treated as such.
findapath,f6y3dkk,t3_dtp2fe,1573266441.0,"Absolutely pursue it. Life is all about growing, unfortunately we stop doing this because it is out of the ""norm"". Go get your degree, it looks like you have done great research. I'm 27 and getting a second degree online, even though it's challenging I am so happy I am getting closer and closer to my goals."

toastme,f5rf5yc,t3_dopw0t,1572393359.0,"That feeling of loneliness is the fucking worst. Been there my friend. All I can say is try new things: drawing classes, pottery classes, volunteer, go to a spoken word open mic night (wonderfully open people there in my experience), sign up to be a foster home for pets. You look crazy cool, and would love to have a friend like you."
