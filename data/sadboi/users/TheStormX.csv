UnsentLetters,fh7q5s8,t3_f1na6y,1581341586.0,"Don't blame yourself. Blame the other person who took advantage of your insecurities. One thing I know about people like them is that they don't know how to keep a relationship, because their partners eventually find out what they are about and leave them.  Then those predators go and search for victims, usually in applications like Tinder, who they can manipulate and push to do things they are not comfortable with. One thing is for sure in your situation, that you didn't do anything wrong!!!"
