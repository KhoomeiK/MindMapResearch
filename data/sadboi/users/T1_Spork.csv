Terraria,foj3duu,t1_foiblaw,1587806769.0,Calamity buffs it and the Pearlwood Bow and Hammer so it's at least *servicable* if you somehow have nothing else. The bow is extra interesting though since Calamity buffs it to fire a triple rainbow.
Warthunder,fnkr78r,t3_g2433s,1587037528.0,"The ammo racks definitely are the Syonan's biggest weakness. Even a 40mm Bofors cannon can detonate them without much difficulty. You can even potentially snipe them using a US 3-inch gun or Russian gunboat cannon firing APHE.

Outranging them isn't too difficult as well, just stay beyond 2km so the AA guns can't reach you, with your only danger being their cannons which aren't too difficult to dodge as a smaller boat.

With this in mind, you can easily harass a Syonan beyond their AA range if you have a Bofors or larger cannon on your boat."

Warthunder,f3k5mww,t1_f3k42t6,1570962130.0,"Don't got much experience fighting in the Swift as I'm still grinding out the modules in AB Assault, but I can offer a few tips.

The cannons absolutely shred. You barely need anytime on target at all to secure a kill, even with stock belts, and you get a decent amount of ammo. Fire in short bursts, as that's usually all you need.

Acceleration and top speed is very good and it's fairly nimble. As with all jets, you want to keep your speed up and avoid taking turns unless absolutely necessary. There's also no airbrakes, which is something to keep in mind."
Warthunder,f3k3y7r,t1_f3jmx1a,1570961594.0,"Oh definitely. Especially aircraft such as the A-36 that get 1 minute reload on the bombs that can absolutely devastate an entire fleet on its own, while still being nimble enough to dogfight. The constant plane spam gets really annoying really fast.

I think in-air reloading should be removed, forcing players to land to reload."

Of course everything is a bit rough around the edges. I'm definitely planning on making a custom gui for the ship info instead of attempting to cram as much information as possible within the dialogue boxes.

I'm still not sure if I want to use those sprites, but those won't cause me any copyright issues thanks to creative commons and I think they look pretty neat too. If you were wondering what I was using before, they were assets ripped straight out of FTL. I'm still deciding if I want to commission some backgrounds or other sprites though."

Warthunder,f1nsixq,t1_f1mfei8,1569625130.0,"I totally agree with you on planes in AB naval battles. If you kill someone there's a very high chance there's a bomb with your name on it. If your in something with shitty anti-air like the Mutsuki or something with NO anti-air whatsoever like the first Clemson then forget about it.

Honestly, disabling in-air reloading and forcing players to land to reload would solve a lot of the problems with planes in that mode.

It's a bit better once you get proximity fuse shells though, swatting planes out of the sky from 5km+ out with the Sumner on AI gunners never stops getting satisfying."

The pills themselves are small, so you should have no problem swallowing them with water. If you get zoloft YOU MUST TAKE THEM WITH WATER unless you want your throat to burn in agony for hours, speaking from experience.

They take a few weeks to finally take effect. In my case it was moderately effective and made my mood more neutral rather than happy but better than depressed constantly. Unfortunately it seems i eventually developed a tolerance since the drugs don't seem to be as effective anymore, something to keep in mind. You might need swap between drugs til you find one thats right for you.

Good luck."
