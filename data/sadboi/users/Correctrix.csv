truscum,fq0geam,t1_fpyc0f8,1589031449.0,"1. I trained my voice before transition to sound male and heteronormative because I sounded weird.  After transition, I mostly just reverted to the soft, kinda cute-sounding voice that I used when speaking to my partners, but started consciously avoiding the lower reaches of my pitch. Over time, this just somehow started to pass. I astonished my flatmate yesterday by proving to her, with an app, that my everyday voice is actually in the middle of the male range.  She thought I'd just be in the low female range from the subjective impression it gives.  If I had Yeson and raised my voice to even an androgynous pitch, it would become one of those voices that's so female that I'd get gendered female even if I looked male.  I used to be on the radio before transition.  With surgery, I could seriously be an audiobook narrator or something.
2. I know that women have lots of variety in the shape of the vulva.  It's not that.  I mean, I have an oval birthmark which is now straight down one side because it was sliced in half.  That just wouldn't ever happen except in the event of one's crotch undergoing major surgery.
3. Transition *is* about perfection if we're going to put words like ‘full’ in front of it and declare it to be so complete that the thing it's addressing (transsexualism) is over and done with.  The degree of transition that I have done is sufficient for someone to be a woman without prefixes, sure.  I'm not a ‘transwoman’; I'm a woman and I happen to be transsexual.  It's just not enough to pretend that the incongruence that pushed me to transition no longer exists.  It persists, just as a low and manageable level.  I still have some male/masculine traits as a consequence of being born mostly male, i.e. being transsexual, and these still give me the occasional twinge of dysphoria. I'm in remission, not really cured.  99% isn't 100%.
4. I think you could say that if it were at the level of the average cis woman who just feels bad about a bit of facial hair or whatever. And that is *almost* the ballpark I'm in. I've certainly met cis women who are more insecure about their beauty, weight, femininity, etc. than I am. But the fact is that *I* know that my bassy voice is specifically due to my male puberty, etc.  Passing isn't a binary thing.  I think that a very clued-up person could clock me.  Someone recently worked out I'm trans due to some of my past anecdotes being incongruous, and the way I dodged a menstruation question.  She emphasised that nothing about my voice, appearance or behaviour gave her a clue, but... surely if I were 5' tall, with huge hips and a soprano voice, I could have got away with any number of dodgy anecdotes without my being trans popping into her mind.
5. Yes, it puts me in essentially the same boat as a post-menopausal woman.  I've pointed this out to TERFs myself.  But I'm in that boat at a young age specifically because I'm trans.  It's just an example of being trans having a lingering effect.  Hey, at least at 41 I'm now old enough that I could actually be in premature menopause, and it becomes more plausible with each year that goes by."

truscum,fpyathr,t1_fpy5uoj,1589000022.0,"> Okay, I feel like we are coming closer to an understanding

That can't be happening.  This is an online argument.  I'm pretty sure we're supposed to go back and forth, ignoring half of what we say, and the call each other Nazis.

1. My pitch is actually entirely male. I'm naturally a bass-baritone.  You'd crap your pants if I dropped to the bottom of my range.  I somehow pass due to the feminine *way* I speak.  I don't really understand how it works.  People occasionally seem uncertain of my gender on the phone, so some of the gendering of my voice must be bolstered by my appearance.  When I make completely involuntary sounds (not ordinary coughing or sneezing, which are quite girly, but seriously choking on something, or vomiting) I find the bassiness of it rather disconcerting.  I would so *love* to be able to sing, but I can only hold a note at low pitches.

2. I think that Dr Chettawut did an awful job. I've had one-night stands with men and women, including trans women, without being clocked, but I myself see a bajillion trans-specific flaws in my vajayjay, and would like them fixed if possible.  The vast majority of cis women don't need this.  They might have chunky beef curtains (as an ex of mine indecorously put it) that they'd like to reduce, but not features that just don't look like a natural vulva.

3. That's a reasonably full transition.  It's enough to consider someone a woman with no discrimination or caveats.  However, the transition isn't *really* full.  There is more to do, and the person is still transsexual.

4. But it's cosmetic surgery that I specifically need because I'm trans.

5. My fat distribution, breast size, body odour, etc. would deteriorate towards a less female default.  It would be very much like menopause, which causes many cis women to feel dysphoric and unwomanly.  It's not something I should have to deal with at this age.  It's not so horrifically man-like that it makes me actually not a woman or whatever, but it's something that I specifically do face due to my transsexualism.  Also, if I'd had breasts for 20 years longer than I have had mine, they would be bigger and thus could lose volume without my figure becoming androgynous."
truscum,fpy4mt4,t1_fpy1i7f,1588995904.0,"Someone who has indeed fully and truly transitioned would be without any gender congruity.  However, such a transition is impossible, and we're not currently even very close to it.  When I ordinarily say ""fully transition"" I am referring to doing everything that is possible.  Transsexuals before the 20th century, for example, did not fully transition by our current standards, but deserve credit for transitioning fully by the standards of the time.  They did the best they could.

I myself have not fully transitioned if we apply a really strict definition, because the fact is that the only reason I haven't had Yeson voice surgery and an SRS revision is my lack of funds.  But for most purposes I loosely state that I have fully transitioned because I've had SRS, am legally female, and am never clocked as trans as far as I can tell.  If I were sure I could never have any more trans-related treatments, I'd say ""oh well,"" and not be terrifically distraught.  However, without HRT some of my secondary sex characteristics would indeed fade (without being totally nullified), and that would be vexing."
truscum,fpy20s0,t1_fpxzpb2,1588994295.0,"My flair is a joking response to the narrative that we're not ""biological women"" but just ""identify as"" women.  I'm biological, and the majority of female things about me are indeed biological (my breasts, my mind...) not cybernetic or something, or purely cultural.

I don't claim to read 100% female on every single one of the myriad dials that make up a person.  Not even any cis people can boast that.  I have to recognise that there is still way more gender incongruence in me than there is in a normal cis person.  It doesn't make me a dude, or NB, or overly humble about stating my femaleness, or feel very separate from other women, or anything like that.  But it means that there is still pretty clear evidence in me that I have a history of transition, i.e. that I am a transsexual woman.  Although no one ever seems to clock me, I would definitely be able to if I met someone just like me.  I don't have anecdotes of girlhood.  I have never menstruated.

I'm not saying that the mere lack of one of these things is enough to make someone not female, or trans.  I'm saying that *I* lack these things specifically because I'm trans, they are numerous, and they cannot be remedied.  I'm like someone with HIV treated by modern medicine, whose viral load is now negligible and is asymptomatic for AIDS.  I'm in remission, but I still have the condition called transsexualism &mdash; just as, if I'd been born with XXY chromosomes, I'd always have Klinefelter's, even if well-managed and virtually indistinguishable from someone without it.

With the transgenderism of the gender radicals out there, I fully appreciate not wanting to identify or been seen as trans.  I never tell anyone, and I consider it pretty much an insult, given what the term has come to refer to.  But if we're talking about the legit medical condition that leads to gender incongruence as evinced by gender dysphoria that pushes patients to make a full transition, then that is admittedly something that I have been born with and shall die with, no matter how successful my transition or how little I end up thinking about it in daily life."

It should be widespread.  It's definitely not limited to the face or neck.  You may have gathered that impression from EDSers doing the ‘party trick’ of stretching skin there.  I’m guilty of that myself: it's a part of the body that is almost always exposed, so you can stretch it right in the middle of a sentence, in an unplanned way, to make the point that your skin is hyperextensible, and subjectively people are more freaked out by things happening to the human face than they are to, e.g., forearm skin.

The hEDS criteria are, however, vague about how skin hyperextensibility is to be assessed.   The [cEDS criteria](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/eds-types/#cEDS) are clearer:

>Skin is hyperextensible if it can be stretched over a standardized cut off in the following areas: 1.5 cm for the distal part of the forearms and the dorsum of the hands; 3 cm for neck, elbow and knees; 1 cm on the volar surface of the hand (palm).

>Another is joint flexibility. The only clear sign I have is that my elbows bend backwards about 10–15 degrees.

It's a (highly unlikely) longshot hypothesis that I myself am looking into to explain my own EDS symptoms and abnormal sex hormone levels.

If your FBN1 mutation is so rare that it has no name, it seems a good candidate for being the culprit of other quirks (apart from CTD) that don't closely correspond to any known syndrome.  It's apparently on chromosome 15, which is implicated in Prader–Willi syndrome, for example, which can cause hypogonadism.  So, there is some precedent for mutations/deletions around there to affect sexual development.

The medical profession is so focused on horses rather than zebras (even people with EDS, which isn't really all that crazily rare, take years or decades to get any attention) that I suspect that you'll never get much more than shrugs from doctors.

As for your individual features:

The position of the bilateral lumps you have found posteriorly in the vaginal introitus would imply that they are inflamed or hypertrophic Bartholin's glands (which lubricate the vagina).  From what I understand of the progression of testes from their original unisex position inside the body (because they're analogous to ovaries), it's a very late process even in totally male babies, completed as late as nine months after birth.  With your female phenotype, I wouldn't expect them to descend virtually out of the body the way those lumps have.  Moreover, for your gonads to be described as ‘testicles’ (even if you had a high degree of masculinisation), I believe that you'd have to have the SRY gene (on the Y chromosome).  There is also the fact that testicles should not swell in arousal, but a blocked lube gland definitely would.  So, I think they are enlarged Bartholin's glands.  I suspect that they need to be surgically drained, or perhaps you need antibiotics to allow a duct blocked with pus to clear itself.

When you say that you have seven extra holes near your urethra, I'm not sure whether that's already including the expected pair of tiny ducts from the Skene's gland (female prostate) and similar pair from the aforementioned Bartholin's gland.  This should add up to a total of six holes down there anyway.

I seem to remember reading that the Skene's gland is often quite variable in how it drains, not always coming to the surface in neat bilateral ducts, but sometimes instead only reaching the outside to one side of the urethra, with another duct opening inside the urethra as in males (as this is the essentially the gland that makes seminal fluid).  So, if your Skene's ducts deviate from the standard two, it's probably not that weird.  I think the majority of women never actually look (since you pretty much need a magnifying mirror to really see such tiny openings properly).

If your ductal openings are very loose (you indicated that you can stretch them a few millimetres wide), I suspect that it's due to your connective-tissue disorder.  This may make them far more noticeable.  A lot of women could be walking around with some tiny abnormality like that, and never realise, due to their tight connective tissue.

Anyway, I'm no expert.  I hope you find some answers.  You are an awesome space creature.  Live long and prosper.

They don't get that a lot of us just **are** pretty damn unusual and interesting people.  When I tone myself **down**, people find me quirky (and either cool or annoying depending on their tastes).  We don't need to try hard to be interesting.  I try to stay within some basic norms because I live in a society, not because it's in my nature to conform and be at the 50th percentile of every trait I see.

ehlersdanlos,fpnea6p,t1_fpndieh,1588759881.0,"Yep, I had a lot of fatigue and bowel problems stop when I accidentally cut out gluten.  A doctor, who assumed that I was too stupid to actually manage to get into ketosis, asserted that the benefits I was seeing were due to gluten intolerance.  This pissed me off, but I then decided to experiment.  I tried eating pure gluten on a keto diet, and eating sugar on a gluten-free keto diet.  Both consuming gluten and inhibiting ketosis gave me ill effects.  So, since then, I've been gluten-free, and also stuck to a keto diet intermittently.  I sometimes just want to eat proper fruit and vegetables too much to stay in ketosis."
