Blogging,fpb7p8p,t1_fpb7fzl,1588463876.0,Did you use picture adverts like they have the name of your blog on there? I was thinking of starting posting blog adverts when I get monetized so that it is not completely wasted money. I am just not sure what to add or even how to start. I might try a Facebook advert but not spend a lot of money on it as I do not have a lot of money to be wasting as you said. Thank you for the comment :)
