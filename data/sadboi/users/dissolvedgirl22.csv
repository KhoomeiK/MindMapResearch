schizoaffective,ffcg10v,t3_esoabi,1579798667.0,I‚Äôm 35 and just recently had a friendship with another person on SZ spectrum blow up in my face. It was so painful and triggering. I think I‚Äôm ready to get comfortable with ‚Äúgoing it alone‚Äù outside of immediate family relationships. My issues are so complex and debilitating and my past is so complicated that the barrier to entry for friendship with me is a quagmire. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it to trust anyone new to overcome that. Maybe I‚Äôll feel differently someday but I‚Äôd rather be alone than constantly heartbroken over a ‚Äú friend‚Äôs‚Äù judgment and abandonment.
schizophrenia,ffauog0,t3_esdp9t,1579744902.0,"I have to tell myself every day: it‚Äôs okay. To be average. To be gasp ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù even. To feel the burn. The nature of my struggles will never be obvious to others, they will judge me, and I may never have anyone who will tolerate me aside from my husband and son. It‚Äôs okay. I lived with this for 35 years and it seems like something deep down inside me just aint done living."
