If your world was reality, literally anyone with power could be removed in a split second because of an accusation from any woman. It’s essentially a modern political assassination.

Do you know how many black men have had their lives ruined by false accusations from white women? Obviously that’s not the case here but “believing women who say they have been raped” blindly without scrutinizing those claims is damaging and frankly rather idiotic.

Biden worked to pass the ACA which made health care more affordable, and he has realistic plans to make health care even more affordable. Trump’s plan, which luckily failed, was going to make health care even less affordable and accessible. 

Biden’s not nearly as bad as the Bernie bros are trying to portray him as. All of Biden’s bad votes are unforgivable. All of Bernie’s bad votes are just simple mistakes. All of Bernie’s plans are perfect. Biden’s plans, which are progressive, are just lies.

Honestly, it’s time for you all to change your approach. The grievance politics failed in 2016 and 2020. It would also fail in 2024. Hopefully you all will use the Biden administration to advocate some practical solutions. No need to make the fight for universal health care harder than it needs to be with single payer.

politics,fkog3q4,t1_fkof1ld,1584386524.0,"See, you proved my point. Single payer and healthcare’s response to a crisis aren’t terribly related.

Biden’s plan is only a starting point. Bernie’s plan is a work of fiction. The goal for Biden voters is to eventually move to a well regulated market system with a public option. It’s a much easier implementation system than single payer, meaning the transition will cost less, and more importantly, it will happen QUICKER. You’ll have affordable health care in 3 years. With Bernie, you’ll be lucky to get it in 5.

I’d encourage you to read more literature on health care policies. Bernie and his propaganda arm have been misinforming the public. Switzerland has, arguably, the best health care in the world and they don’t even have a public option. There’s many routes to get to affordable, universal coverage. Single payer is arguably the worst route because it would decimate the economy (imagine what’s happening to restaurants right now happening to the private health care industry) and would create so much red tape so as to lower health care outcomes. It could work in theory, but we’d need to set up a system like what works in other countries and transition over 15 years"
