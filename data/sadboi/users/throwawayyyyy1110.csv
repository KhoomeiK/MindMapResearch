bipolar,fpvgszr,t1_fpvbq6u,1588944446.0,Ok I will. Thank you.
bipolar,fpv8i19,t3_gf2xfx,1588938392.0,"Just reading that list makes me tired. I don’t even manage half that stuff. Haven’t left my apartment in days (covid shutdown too). 
Don’t slip up and don’t commit suicide are the constant daily exhausting rules. I keep looking at the clock and thinking when will this all just be over. Life’s just so goddamn long."
bipolar,fpv82sa,t3_gfbr0j,1588938019.0,This is great. Thanks.
bipolar,fpv80pa,t3_gfpwiu,1588937967.0,Seroquel/quetiapine. I’ve developed a bit of a tolerance but 15 years on it and it still works. 20mg p/n. If I’m really anxious I take 2. Knocks me straight into oblivion.
AmItheAsshole,fpv4rty,t3_gflupe,1588934866.0,"NTA I’m so sorry this happened to you. I have bipolar disorder and don’t disclose this to hardly anyone. I’m so private about it and have to do similar things that you do to protect my mental health.  Of course you had no obligation to disclose that you had schizophrenia. 
I would feel betrayed if I was in your position and would have little or no trust left in these “friends.”  It’s up to you if you want to redevelop any trust. One positive is that at least they apologised."
AmItheAsshole,flqcqqi,t1_fln3aq6,1585389108.0,Piggybacking. Have bipolar disorder too. The gf needs to take her pill for delusion ‘cause there just ain’t no reason on the planet to put this in your cv unless you’re applying for a place on a paid trial for a new mood stabiliser.
AmItheAsshole,fl2dm3m,t1_fkt1jjg,1584748598.0,"Yeah there is a lot of truth to this. I choose it. With regards to legal requirements, it sounds like we live in different countries. In the past I have tried to address it openly with disastrous results so I’m just not doing that again."
AmItheAsshole,fks9fca,t1_fkrn73l,1584485095.0,"Jumping on the back of this. I’m diagnosed bipolar disorder with anxiety as well. Medicated. I struggle EVERY day with going to work and anxiety blah blah blah. I have never brought it up at work, never avoided or refused to do work duties, no one at work even know I have bipolar disorder. I can’t believe what this employee is doing with regards to disrupting your business.  She needs a dose of reality. I say fire her and address it honestly with your staff. If they see her as a victim, they’re being sucked in."
raisedbynarcissists,fkg559s,t3_fi6ekq,1584150187.0,"I remember my dad giving me a walloping in public in front of my mum and brother. I remember crying uncontrollably in the car and no one did anything. I truly hate my dad, mum and brother. I have absolutely no contact with my mum and brother and limited superficial contact with my dad. The ugly memory and hatred and realisation I was the scapegoat have NEVER left me. I will carry them with me forever. (Lately I’ve been vaguely hoping my mum catches Covid-19 and dies). What you’ve just experienced is horrible. All you can do is survive and have your own life without them in it. Thinking of you."
AmItheAsshole,fk6wad6,t3_fgs2ol,1583919021.0,"You sound a lot like my brother. He’s controlling and literally screams at family members and his (ex) wife when they won’t do what he wants. He’s becomes FURIOUS when anyone challenges him or defies his authority in any way. 
When his (ex)wife left him and took their child with her, she made sure there were people there when she left so she was safe. 
He was gobsmacked she would leave and just could not understand for the life of him why she had gone. He was just bewildered that she would then level charges of abuse towards him and want nothing to do with him. Because he was such a NICE guy who would never hurt anyone. He was the VICTIM. 

If everyone around you is running from you, hiding from you, refusing to talk to you then it’s pretty obvious you scare people and mistreat them and they want you out of their lives."
raisedbynarcissists,fk2h2wh,t3_ffsqmb,1583800906.0,"Welcome to my world. Most of the time, I’m surprised if someone sees me because I’m so used to thinking I’m invisible. I never expect anyone to seem happy to see me. I was either invisible growing up or ridiculed by my family so now if I get through the day without anything negative happening I consider it an overwhelming success."
bipolar,fijqnls,t3_f86tgx,1582460356.0,Yes to this. I’m up and down so much that usually friendships end because I withdraw so many time and the other person just gets sick of it. I feel so different from other people. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to fix that feeling. I’m just so good at being by myself now.
BipolarReddit,fijqje2,t3_f883sn,1582460216.0,"Totally relate to this. Right now, I’m pretty convinced that my work “friends” really dislike me and the only way to protect myself is to not be around them and withdraw from them. I don’t really know the tricks to stopping this way of thinking. I’m so used to it now. I know that I’m used to spending a LOT of time by myself and that seems to be easier that constantly being confused about whether people like me or not."

AskReddit,fhjv067,t3_f3i60f,1581656417.0,My dad talking to his friend right in front of me about me becoming a teenager saying “yeah she is starting to look that way.”  Made me feel uncomfortable in my body.
AmItheAsshole,fh7hp6u,t3_f1f1n2,1581332404.0,"NTA.  I (42f) recently told my brother (44m) to stop using family members as his therapist. He was calling me and other relatives multiple times a week to talk for HOURS late into the night about his myriad problems - bitter divorce, custody battle you name it. He’s been doing this for decades. I was the only one to say this to his face. My mum enables it by letting him do this but not me. Ain’t nothing wrong with putting down boundaries."
BipolarReddit,fh6puqd,t1_fh4h014,1581303162.0,No one in my family will even say the word bipolar. Even though everyone knows I’m diagnosed because my dad told everyone without asking me first.
BipolarReddit,fh6ovpz,t3_f1bfxx,1581302607.0,When a friend says something that hurts my feelings and I have to pretend i don’t care even though I know I’m going to practically sob about it later alone because I’m so over sensitive and will doubt my very existence if even 1 person insults me.
raisedbynarcissists,fgwgbhk,t3_f0lnhh,1581160787.0,I’m sorry this happened to you. I’ll never forget the day I was about 14 and walking with my family. I started to walk a bit faster than my dad after he had said something to me. He grabbed me and started hitting me and said never walk away from me when I’m talking to you. My mum and brother were there for all of it and ignored me as I cried.  Those memories never leave you.
BipolarReddit,ff5kvae,t1_ff57h90,1579597770.0,For me it was this suffocating intensity of feeling when every thought was terrifying and led to extremes like barely eating and thinking my flat mates were trying to kill me.

They are all in a little pile at the back of my bookcase. I love him."
AskReddit,fcn2l9m,t1_fcmoo8d,1577801504.0,I do this too. I’ve always blamed it on having bipolar disorder and being a bit of a hermit. I swear the best convos I have are with myself. I can really get into film critiquing with someone’s opinion I respect.
raisedbynarcissists,fc2dhix,t3_efq5g8,1577353804.0,Thank you for putting into words something I struggle with every day. Even my work colleague mocks me for not acting my age sometimes. I don’t know how to “make myself grow up” at an accelerated pace. Nice to have a shout out.
bipolar,f94wu4u,t3_e3je3w,1575107763.0,But also knowing the best thing I can do for friend when I’m in that mood is ghost them bc it would be FAR FAR worse for them to actually be around me.
BipolarReddit,f8x1nco,t3_e2lejm,1574905817.0,"First off, you’re not alone. You might feel it right now, but there’s plenty of us out here struggling with study and/or employment and being able to complete stuff. You’re not alone so please don’t commit suicide. 
I started my undergrad degree when I was 23 and didn’t graduate until I was 30 due to hospitalisation, being unwell, not coping etc.  I was glad I finished it, completing it made me feel good about myself. 
So ask yourself - how would it feel if you stopped pursuing this path? Would you feel relieved? Hopeless? Could you consider other options? 
Taking your own time to do something is no failure. It’s just taking your own time to do something. This is your life and an advisor or whoever put you off achieving this part doesn’t get to make your life decisions for you."
BipolarReddit,f7ykp8p,t1_f7y2zyl,1574096744.0,Excellently said.
BipolarReddit,f7e0rz3,t3_dvhoym,1573640576.0,I thought long and hard about having a child and ultimately decided against it. I have BP type 1. I wasn’t so worried about passing the BP on. Now I’m a couple years older and I know I made the right decision. I just could not have handled the stress.

mentalhealth,f6ydwyp,t3_dtmqje,1573276131.0," Very happy birthday, sincerely. You got one thing - you’re still alive and have survived it all. That takes guts and courage and probably only you know just how much. I was alone on my 40th as well - I find relationships hard to sustain and cocoon in my cave too much. You have the right to feel good about yourself and the right to reward yourself (in a healthy non-drug way) for the fact you’re still here and still working on things."
BipolarReddit,f6ydk6a,t1_f6xt1o9,1573275745.0,The puppies will always love you.
BipolarReddit,f6ydgh0,t3_dtpx76,1573275635.0,"Well thank you for this goddamn beautiful compliment. I know I deserve it but no one else has ever taken the time to give it to me. People are always telling me I’m too sensitive, don’t have enough resilience etc.  And I’m thinking “you have no ideas how strong I am”."

BipolarReddit,f6q2tsu,t3_dsi526,1573069798.0,"Hey, I can relate to some of this especially the part about not having the energy to pretend everything is ok. I don’t really do that so much anymore as you’re right, it is absolutely exhausting. I put on a smile at work but I just don’t have the energy for small talk and chit chat right now. Mostly I find if you’re smiling a bit but mostly staying quiet, people tend to assume you’re generally ok and they leave you alone (sigh of relief). 

For now all I do is go home and cocoon and the only time I leave the house is to go to support groups. That’s where my life is at right now, I’m taking care of myself and that’s ok with me. If anyone has a problem with that, too bad. 

It’s ok to let things be messy for now - finances, your mixed moods and everything. Just take care of yourself and keep asking for help until you find meds that help. That can take awhile but there are good combinations available.

Oh and yeah, I fuck up almost every friendship too. So I’m gonna take a break from that for awhile and just stop even pretending “have great friends” is on my to do list."
BipolarReddit,f6q1y3n,t3_dsjfe0,1573069257.0,"I’m on 100 mg of quetiapine and it does sedate me in the sense that I get almost 8 hours sleep every night and it dulls my mild paranoia. 

I don’t think it’s working for you the right way looking at how unmotivated and maybe detached you are. Or maybe it’s not the quetiapine at fault, maybe you need a better antidepressant? Are you able to see your doctor or psychiatrist about this?

Also those 2 papers will be there anytime to complete. You feel the way you feel and if you need help now just let yourself focus on that and take the pressure if yourself academically if you can. Take care."
BipolarReddit,f6q1dmg,t3_dsfl2n,1573068910.0,"I didn’t really like being in hospital (public system psychiatric ward) but I know exactly what you mean. I can’t put my finger on it but it was something to do with being able to acknowledge to myself I had hit rock bottom and didn’t have to pretend any differently anymore. 
Ironically, when I was in an expensive, private psychiatric clinic there was no sense to f comfort and every day was a nightmare."

BipolarReddit,f6le6wj,t3_drvgcs,1572940163.0,"750mg lithium, 100mg seroquel. Please don’t stop taking your meds. I know it feel frustrating and lack lustre now but I don’t think coming off them is the answer. I’ve gradually regained some creativity and fascination with aspects of life. I’ve learned to live with things I’ve lost - I can’t read for hours on end like I used to. 
The honest advice I’ve gotten from doctors and therapists I’ve respected is that bipolar’s there for life and so are the meds. The long haul is more about figuring out how to get your life the way you need/ want it alongside the meds. 
Take care."

BipolarReddit,f6b1ygt,t3_dqrw3f,1572766831.0,"This. Exactly what I experience. Those lines “you make people feel uncomfortable” and “people can see how you feel on your face. “  That stuff just starts to destroy you after awhile. 
I’m just surviving it right now, one day at a time. Honestly I have given up trying to have a “normal” life with constant friends and relationships. 
Without stability of mood, it’s just exhausting try to keep things even outside of myself."
