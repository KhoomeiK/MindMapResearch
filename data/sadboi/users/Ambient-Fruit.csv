My main worry is the storyline :

Will the quests be shallow?

will the characters be memorable?

how diverse are the player's lines gonna be depending on the clan? 

will it have a lasting impact on us like vtmb had?

I hope they are taking their time to polish the game and not just pushing the date due to the current status of the planet."
