I’ve done some crafts & worked a couple jigsaw puzzles but there are frequent chunks of time where I couldn’t tell you what I had spent my time doing. I can’t focus on the tv so have I just been staring at walls or what? 

I meet with my therapist on line & that has added just a bit of much needed structure. Do you have support people you can connect with?

BorderlinePDisorder,fjix3pz,t1_fjithbx,1583377760.0,"I made a distress tolerance box when I took DBT. There are no rules, you can have fun with it! We decorated our boxes with cool paper &/or ribbon and I put things like gum, pics that inspire joy or inspiration, perfume samples, playdoh, & a deck of cards in my box.

It’s meant to employ a grounding technique to engage as many of your 5 senses as possible when you are upset. They taught us that when your SUDs (subjective units of distress) get too high, you can’t think clearly. So you can pull out your distress tolerance kit, engage your senses to bring you back to the moment & lower your SUDs, putting you in a better headspace to use your other skills.

I was nervous about therapy & DBT class but gradually I started using more & more skills without even noticing! Of course I still have moments of crisis but I don’t know how much worse it would be if I didn’t have those recovery skills “in my toolbox”. DBT class saved my life. Seriously.
