But also I'll never not recommend self-care and mental health work. Life will always throw challenges, but there are SKILLS YOU CAN LEARN to handle them better.

I didn't stop drinking after 5 arrests.

I didn't stop drinking after over 18 months in rehab/mental health facilities. (multiple stays)

I didn't stop drinking when it cost me my dignity, my respect, or the respect of all my friends and family.

Because deep down, I was in PAIN. At first I didn't even know it was there, but even when I knew, I didn't know what to do about it. It was unbearable, and apparently nothing else was more important than numbing it or pretending it wasn't there. 

This year I was finally honest with my therapist, took an assessment, and now I have a diagnosis that actually makes sense:

I have Bipolar (type 2) and PTSD. I wish I'd found out sooner, but it is what it is...

I'm working on meds now. Still early days, but I'm not drinking a fifth of vodka every night, so progress!

I don't know your situation, and I try really hard not to tell other people what they ""should"" do, I try to just share my experience/perspective and hope it helps in some way.
