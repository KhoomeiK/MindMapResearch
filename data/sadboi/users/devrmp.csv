I'm pretty sure my char got misgendered a few times as well but, I have started clicking through the text quickly so I don't have to see that. But, now I miss out on the rp :("
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fc4tppm,t1_fbj2hj4,1577428055.0,"You can conditioner more if you want. The key is to not use shampoo to remove the oils from your scalp. More washing -> more oil production -> more split ends, dry hair, and in some cases damaged hair. And I usually don't even rinse my hair over those 9 days.

Also, sorry for the late replay!"
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fbi3daj,t1_fbhks4j,1576889621.0,"Step 1: Don't wash your hair too often (I wish my hair about once every 9 days - this will take some time to build up to but if you keep washing your hair less you can get to this point)

Step 2: Make sure to use conditioner and leave it in for enough time

Step 3: Don't use a hair dryer

Step 4: Don't brush your hair too much

Step 5: Cast a spell to remove bad hair days from existence"

bipolar,f6ahotb,t1_f64wfrx,1572757037.0,In my case it's just about comfort since I'm obviously trans or at least I think I still am. It's nice to have someone that won't misgender me and make the whole experience horrible.
