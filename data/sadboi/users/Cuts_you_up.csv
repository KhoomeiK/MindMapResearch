 Why?

Because if you're alone too much you start losing social etiquette. It's the small things that you start to lose like, telling a good joke, listening to others with compassion, not interrupting or flow of conversation. In life you WILL need to interact socially, especially when this all blows over. Conversation comes easy to others but not for us (for us its work) and if you don't use it, you'll lose it and it's going to make you real awkward and dislikable."
