totalwar,fkixjog,t3_fia4qf,1584231009.0,"I'm currently doing my 1st brettonia campaign and like my 3rd campaign ever.

What I'm doing is having 3 or 4 separate Lords going round as a blob. 

1 is a Lord with a few paladins, some trebuchet and loads of archers.

2 is a Lord with some knights, best I can afford to maintain. 

3rd is a life mage. 

4th is just a lord. 

I'll move 2, 3 and 4 to locations they can support the fight and then engage with my archers and trebuchet. 

Use the paladins to engage the blobs while trebs and archers fire away. Mage to health the lords and paladins. Cav to charge the blob. 

I currently have 3 seperate armies like this, 1 fighting Marienburg with louen. 2nd is the enchantress and has landed in the jungles by teclis. 3rd is putting down rebellions near skaven light and sartosa and I'm not really sure where to take it afterwards. 

For sieges I trebuchet the towers, wall, soften with archers then push with cav and Lords. I give my paladins and Lords flying mounts when I can so while the tebuchets are doing their thing I'll dive on artillery or solo units when I can. 

That said, I am playing on normal so take what I say with a grain of salt."
