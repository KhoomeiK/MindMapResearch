Trufemcels,foxi4pq,t3_g9xo4t,1588144710.0,"I am so sorry girl, this world is so unfair and it has hurt us so much. Your classmates are cruel, while your teacher is HORRIBLE. She ignored you when you tried to explain your situation and open up to her. As an educator, she is supposed to be someone that students can trust and even be vulnerable and open up to, but she failed at it. It just aches my heart so much reading this, and it hurts when I think about how hopeless and defeated I would feel if I were in that situation."

Trufemcels,fmzyx7i,t3_fxe7c5,1586532310.0,"When I was in elementary school in 4th grade, there was a boy sitting in front of me. Almost every girl in my class had a crush on him, and I was kinda meh. Not until when we accidentally touched hands as he turned around and borrowed my eraser, that I had a crush on him, at that moment I literally froze and stuttered my words. I tried everything to have conversations and interactions with him afterwards, as 10 year old me was still dreaming about having a crush and so. I tried to borrow one of his Harry Potter books as I thought if he let me borrow it, he would let me be closer to him (lol silly old me). There was a beautiful Stacy who also wanted to borrow his book and I had an argument with her about the fact that I asked him first. As I was holding the book in my hand, he grabbed it aggressively from me and handed to the Stacy. He let her borrow the book first instead. I was in shock, my heart was literally shattered into thousand of pieces at that moment. I did not talk to him ever since then. At a very young age I realized that lookism was real, and that I had to try harder in order to achieve anything in life."

UOW,f83srj0,t3_dwm4l2,1574219955.0,"Hi! First of all, welcome to UOW! 

For your first semester, I think you should enrol yourself into classes on your study plan in the first year, rather than enrol in electives (the classes that you added for fun). Check out the key dates on UOW website as well. You should look into UOW Students Buy & Sell group on Facebook for more information or concerns throughout your course, and find other students that also enrol in the same course as you, this subreddit is not too active so you might not get replies here.

Regarding the accommodation, I personally rented a room near campus so that it is convenient to travel to uni. It would definitely be a lot cheaper living off campus, as single rooms are around $140-200 and double rooms are around $200-250, compared to living on Kooloobong campus ($280-$300 for single person or some sort). Living on campus definitely has a lot of benefits though, you make a lot of friends around and it is a big community there that can help you with all sort of stuffs and it is definitely more secure as well. 

If you need any more help, just message me and I'll be able to answer it :) Good luck!"
