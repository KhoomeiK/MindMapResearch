ADHD,f67usla,t3_dqkh1a,1572723005.0,"If it's your first time using stimulants, you should feel euphoric for the first couple of weeks. The feeling isn't meant to be subtle, so either your metabolism is unique or the dosage is too low. Or it could be a bad brand, not all generics are alike. I personally like Teva. 

ALSO, avoid consuming anything acidic, having coffee can reduce the effectiveness of the medication."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,f5z6vgj,t1_f5yeb6f,1572568779.0,"This is definitely a thing. About a year ago I was involved in a car accident. Nothing major, but when I got home after the fact, my mom asked me what time it was when I got hit. Turns out that right around that time, she was out gardening when she heard an ambulance, and all of a sudden got a bad feeling about something happening to me."
BPD,f5xk9pu,t3_dppdlx,1572542094.0,Lol yeah my whole persona changes
BPD,f5t3c64,t3_dp78ns,1572449512.0,"Yeah, and with therapy i would sometimes find that i would be more curious about what my therapist makes of me rather than focusing on therapeutic work. I always saw it as some sort of self-absorption, but you putting it in the frame of having a lack of identity puts it into a healthier context."
SuicideWatch,f52m1vt,t3_dmg28p,1571951423.0,"Trust your intuition, if you don't know why you're in college or what you want to do, it's better not to spend your time or money there and to take a year off instead. Life isn't a linear path, don't let your parents guilt you into staying, because although they may have supported you thus far and have dealt with a lot from their own lives, their perspectives may be limited by the fact that they are immigrants in a foreign country."

CPTSD,ezupgwg,t3_d2a34s,1568157986.0,"I feel like most people define being safe as the absence of negative feelings about yourself, but if that's feeling safe, it's not enough for me to have productive therapy sessions. I need to feel genuinely cared for and valued, but it's hard for me to generate those feelings with a therapist since they're paid to spend time with you. I only feel truly safe around best friends or loved ones."
CPTSD,ezmtq4x,t3_d0wgc1,1567996858.0,"You put to words exactly how I feel at work. My shifts consist of me driving a van with a coworker. I'll happily listen to whatever issues they're having and expand on them, but when i talk about what's going with my emotional life, they either don't contribute anything or change the subject shortly. They'll get offended and think i'm an asshole because i'm not excited enough to talk to them. Shit's hard to fake after 13 hours. Then coming back home to a Nmom. It's infuriating."
socialskills,ez8bdqx,t3_d0486t,1567738778.0,"You have a point, but the issue of social anxiety is an emotional one, not cerebral. It's almost impossible to NOT focus on yourself when you're sensitive to potential rejection or have a low sense of self worth. I've been at both ends of the spectrum. Best cure for social anxiety is to have a good emotional support system that makes you feel understood and like you belong."

ADHD,evmktnn,t3_ckeb7x,1564609427.0,"It sounds like she's annoyed about the prospect of certain behaviors being scapegoated by having them labeled as 'ADHD-exclusive"" behaviors. Either way it doesn't seem to me like she came from a place of understanding given how curt her reactions were. I suggest taking actions that show that you are putting in the effort to remember things, but if she's not able to understand, that's on her."

ADHD,eramnkk,t3_c13kev,1560647881.0,"Could it be a combination of a fear of rejection and wanting to impress the girl by being someone you're not? It's a cliche suggestion but the less you care, the better. Don't try to force things or freak out if they're not going your way. Do you have meds? They can help immensely"

It's funny how family members feel entitled to verbalize their ""concern"" about meds when they don't even bother to research the very medications or conditions they're warning you about.
