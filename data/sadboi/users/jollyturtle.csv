I am a teacher myself and trust me that they want to know if there's anything they can do to help. That's why they went into education and work with kids.  

I don't know if your parents are rational people, but if you are in the US, you can remind them that mental health professionals are legally bound to confidentiality (the law is called HIPAA), so no one else will know you go unless they are sitting in the same waiting room! You can even call it ""life coaching"" if that makes them feel better."
actuallesbians,ew4kz0y,t3_cmharm,1565112842.0,"One trend I see really hurting young girls is being pressured into sending sexual texts or photos and then these getting shown around school, posted online, used as bargaining, etc. Going along with self-love and consent (and understanding that no one that truly likes and respects you will pressure you to give any part of yourself that you don't enthusiastically want to give away), this topic could be brought in. It's so cool that she is open to talking with you. If she does start getting pressure to sext or if a photo/chat does ""leak"" to her peers, she can come to you instead of trying to hide it."

Anxietyhelp,ew4b1p0,t3_cmllg5,1565106806.0,"Religion can help people get through all sorts of emotional episodes, so if you believe in Jesus in your heart you can find strength and comfort in him.

But it won't ""cure"" a medical problem.

Would your mother tell you the same thing if you had diabetes or cystic fibrosis?  I met one crazy person who told me that diabetes could be cured with positive thoughts, but hopefully your mom's not that cray?

Hope and positive thoughts are always good and will help, but it sounds like she needs an education as to what mental illness really is."
Anxietyhelp,ew46ddc,t3_cmiyid,1565103848.0,"Take basic precautions and be observant (e.g. I'm a teacher so I always make sure my classroom door is locked), keep fit in case you ever need to run or fight or carry someone, but otherwise, there is nothing besides trying to vote in the right people and trying to make the world a better place with your presence. You are much more likely to be hurt in a car accident than get shot by a terrorist. It's a fear that I understand, but it's not a very rational one to change your life over. Don't let these terrorists win. Live life proudly."
TwoXChromosomes,ew1ssxb,t1_ew1pd33,1565030653.0,"Agree - ""travel"" does not equal ""fulfilling life.""

I'm 32 and have lived abroad and traveled to over 35 countries. Love to travel! But does it ""fulfill"" me? Do I have a perfect life? No. Moving from one set of coordinates to another does not do that.

Of course, neither does just having a kid because you don't know what else to do. I've not had a kid, and am on the fence about it. I've heard from other mothers that ""wanting to feel fulfilled"" is the absolute wrong answer to the question, ""Why do you want to be a mom?"" 

Can't speak for everyone else, but I feel like searching for fulfillment is a lost cause. I used to bounce around trying to get ""fulfilled,"" and at least for me, I'm giving up on that. I've managed to feel ""fulfilled"" for about 2 hours at a time max. My new goal is *contentment* at least 51% of the time. 

I don't recommend leaving everything to backpack around Indonesia OR having kids as a remedy to finding your true happiness. You'll be disappointed in either."

nailbiting,evxbt8x,t3_clnqdt,1564887624.0,"I've compulsively picked at my fingers for 2 decades, and just this year I found something that works for me. I don't know if it would help those who bite rather than pick, but I'll still share.

A nail salon I had been going to (manicures used to help me stop picking for like, maybe 2 days) started using a nail painting procedure called Powder Dip. Once you get your nails ""dipped,"" they are really thick. I literally cannot use my nails to rip at my skin. It even makes scratching an itch hard, but I've been keeping my nails painted non-stop for the last 6 months and I've gotten completely used to it, and my cuticles look so normal! The paint will not come off on its own, and it's impossible to pick it off like with regular polish or gel. So it lasts 4 weeks (until the nail has grown too long and you've gotta do something about it). It's $40 a pop, but in 20 years of hypnosis, rubber band snapping, ring fiddling, and even glove wearing, it's the only thing that has helped me to no longer be that girl who picks her fingers.  I'm going to start researching how to do this procedure at home so I don't have to keep spending so much money. And hopefully, with enough time, I'll have kicked the habit and no longer need to do this at all (it can't be very healthy for my nails - but it certainly can't be worse than creating open wounds in my fingers every day for 2 decades). But I will be patient because a habit of over 20 years will take longer than half a year to break.

Good luck! I feel your pain."

But now I’m 32 and totally over it. I’ve even been able to sometimes look back fondly on the friendship we had knowing full-well we’ll never be friends again. 

Don’t contact them anymore. You can repeat to yourself: “The [insert friend’s name] event is over. I need a better life” as a mantra. And know that it’s all over now and you can allow yourself to move on.

I know now that it’s not *my fault* for not responding how I would have liked to. I was not expecting it, I had 5 seconds to respond, and I am not he one who did something wrong.  It should not be my burden to be “at the ready” for being violated at any moment. I don’t want to live like that. 

Until I read your post I literally hadn’t thought of this incident from my past for several months. It happened 8 years ago. It took me about a month to shake off the whole thing and forgive myself. But time did heal the wound. 

Sorry about this bitch and her asshole friends. It’s normal to be pissed and hurt. But in the end your strength will prevail."

He kept at it for a while, but eventually he veered off after all I kept repeating was ""No English."" and then horrible Polish.
