Worked for a travel and hospitality group, the main revenue making brand of the company I worked for laid off 60-80% of its employees. This was after asking to take pay cuts the month before with reduced hours, so they can pay less severance pay.

They are trying to not pay notice pay for their employees, because it's a tough time so they can break the law. The executives are of course are still there. At my brand, today the executives are make a huge sacrifice of ""-30%"" pay. Asked us how much we would cut of our salaries...

I'm protecting my core team and I last week, so I draft a letter signed by my immediate team with 3 options: 1 highlighting a minor cut with the same hours, 2 more cuts with less hours for everyone, 3 more cuts with less hours and detailed how my supervisor is dead weight and he should have his hours and pay cut more. Getting ahead of it, so I plant that seed that he's useless...because they are planning that this covid will be better in 3 months lol...not planning for the whole year lol.

Exec in charge emailed me huffing and puffing saying he was appalled that I called it a negotiation and that I did it as a team, it's not negotiation...it's survival.

I just thought,""what about the survival of everyone else you laid off, that you're trying to not pay an extra month. -30% salary, but you expense everything..."" Survival, right...scumbag

Update: 

I was let go with 1.5 months pay, forced to sign a resignation letter. When asking for the termination letter to extend to the unemployment office...HR is giving me the run around. I might get or I might not. I don't care...just sorry for my core team...going to miss working with them. I have about 6 months to get by...I just hope there aren't more mutations so a vaccine can quickly take care of the two dominant strains."

You'll find people that don't do any real work in companies and just play politics. While young people soldier on and get forced to do all the work. You will find bosses that hate you so you don't get ahead or can't communicate with them ever.

I get you have passion and are disappointed that someone that was supposed to be open-minded is really full of bias, petty emotions, and what not.

You have two options, make the best paper you can, stand your ground and take that B or C with pride, or change the topic and get a higher grade, but going through the motions and writing a half assed professor-approved paper.

It's one class that won't matter in the grand scheme of things. The grade matters so you keep getting grants. 

In terms of arguing with your mom, she's just cranky or complaining from being in a shitty situation all the time: we all are in a shitty situation unless you're part of the top 1%. Just smile at your mom's complaints and walk away, or use calm detached tones when talking with her.

The biggest challenge of getting to where you want to go is controlling your emotions and approaching things in a calm matter, it disarms the people you are talking to, allows you to manipulate them to your benefit, expose their biases and weaknesses to get them on your side. You can't effectively study your enemy when you're angry. Study and manipulate your opponents to work with them or crush them."

Keep fighting until I can't anymore. For what...I don't really know."

He's never had lights shone blinding in him in his face or guns drawn at him just because his pants and hoodie were too baggy, or just because he looked threatening. He's never been pulled over because his car was too nice or too beat up.

He's never had a loan denied because he lives in the wrong zipcode. He's never been called racial slurs when working retail. He's never had people look down on him because of the color of his skin or quality of his clothes.

He just hasn't."

I wouldn't have missed out on much. Everything else this past year has been a disappointment filled with regret of bad decisions made and just trying to move forward.

I saw how climate change and over tourism has destroyed one of the best snorkeling spots in Thailand. 

Sometimes I fight with really heavy bouts of depression with some suicidal thoughts, but I keep fighting the good fight...gotta keep going until you have nothing left...I guess, its what is socially acceptable."
