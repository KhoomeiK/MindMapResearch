I'm hoping there is a light in all this and that I have a chance to be meds free. Like I said, the side effects aren't the best with medication. I find I'm more myself off meds until of course I get a psychotic break down. But I hear there are chances where you can be find without taking meds anymore so I'm hoping it will be my case.

It's very hard condition to have but now I take an excellent medication and have had no symptoms of schizophrenia in the past year and a half. I plan on stopping medication when I'm 29 to see if I can handle it for the last time, if not I'll know it will be for life (the medication and the disorder)."
AskReddit,fcc7nrx,t3_cdqmob,1577595312.0,"When I wasn't on medication it was scary. For me it began with delusions like I'd believe my friend stoled from me (when she didn't) or I'll think that the bracelet I'm wearing is cursed and causing me to be delirious.. Then I lost the bracelet and I saw a black figure far away holding it, which scared me. I then found my bracelet in my mum's car.

When I start seeing people, the thing is the people you see usually look exactly how you would see a normal person in the streets or like how you would see your friend. Which is why it was hard for me to understand reality, but then they'd disappear right away in plain sight. Sometimes they looked like they were dead, I saw a girl with no eyes, just black sunken into her face. That was another weird experience I had. As well, the voices are scary sometimes they're in my head or it sounds like they're behind me or around me. It sounds like a familiar voice at times, and sometimes it sounds like a voice you never heard of before. They don't tell me to harm myself but they say weird things. Like when I was at my friend's house I heard a voice say ""they're going to hell"" and another point I heard a prayer verse. Luckily, the voices don't come often when I wasn't on medication, oh and once they said ""your coworker is trying to kill you"" and I'll see an image pop up of that person. It's honestly very weird. As well, I believed it was the apocalypse at one point and that the dead were coming alive.

Oh and I had an issue where I thought my mum wasn't truly my mum that she was an imposter posed as a robot. Also I thought I was dead and nobody could  see me, that my body was going to get buried because I thought I felt my heart stop. And that I turned into a ghost. There's much more I've gone through but now I'm back on an excellent medication with very few side effects. I haven't relapsed it's been over a year and no symptoms what so over of schizophrenia. Hope this gives some insight!"
schizophrenia,fcc4wrx,t3_ebtnte,1577594451.0,The title is somewhat contradicting each other. I believe it does cause schizophrenia but not to everyone.
