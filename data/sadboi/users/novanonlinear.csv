BPD,foh8e6e,t3_g70ov2,1587761752.0,"THIS, and I cannot stress this enough, is so accurate. Truly makes me angry! 
It’s funny how I’m always the one who gets called out on my behaviour, just because I’m borderline even when the other person is being equally unreasonable."
BPD,fnsko7t,t3_g37inw,1587223592.0,"That’s what matters most to me! As long as I can reduce the impact on other people, I feel like it’s a small victory. 

The only other thing that’s helped me is removing myself from the situation (when plans get changed) - if I can’t cope with it then it’s best for me not to go into something feeling emotionally turbulent. I’d rather miss out than hurt anyone."
BPD,fnqy9md,t3_g37inw,1587174882.0,"I’ve struggled with this badly in the past! I’ve often ‘ruined’ social events for myself by getting too upset about it too. I used to be so angry with people who cancelled on me - always thinking they were doing something more fun with someone better than me.

But I also think I just find it harder to readjust than most people - and so I become unnecessarily upset and angry. 

I’ve been better lately by just relaxing my expectations a bit - and only thinking one step ahead. Easier said than done, but progress all the same!"
