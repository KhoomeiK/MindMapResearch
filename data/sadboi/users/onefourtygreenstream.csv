However, nowadays, it's hard to do that amount of exercise. If you're only burning a couple of hundred calories, it's really up to your discretion. If you feel like that extra sustenance helps you keep to a good program, eat them back. If you don't need them, don't eat them. Listen to your body when it comes to this.
