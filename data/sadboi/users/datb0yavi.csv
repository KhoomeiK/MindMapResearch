I think it's only androids, but there's this app called automate, which you use to essentially build programs to automatically do things on your phone. I mean, you're an engineer so it may seem ""easy"" for lack of a better word, but it's fun to see what you can make. You can browse the community and download there programs too.

One I made myself for example is, when I insert headphones into my audio jack, spotify opens, resumes playback, and sets the ringer and notifications to silent, while keeping the media volume at a point that I like.

Advice,fg5t7v8,t3_ex1jz4,1580537997.0,"I know a couple of people with ""useless"" degrees. They always say it was wasted time. Sure, your family expects certain things, but if I were you, I'd take some time and give some thought into explaining to your family the predicament you're in, just like you did for us in this post. Lean heavy on the debt thing as it appears they won't budge on the education part. If they ABSOLUTELY won't agree with you in any way, finish your degree. You'll be in debt, but tbh, it's a better move because you'd be surprised the jobs you could get just because of the fact that you have a degree, no matter what it's in. Even if you get a garbage job, but it's ahead of people with no degree, it'll still make you look better when it comes to promotions. I personally think college is a waste of time, and should be avoided, but only if you have the money to survive NOT going to school vs going to school. You gotta balance everything out you know. Like I said, lean heavy on the financial burden, and I mean HEAVY, because if there's one thing every person on the planet understands is money."
