mentalhealth,fqmiejh,t1_fql6rnk,1589477958.0,"Yeah, there's some societal pressure in that regard. Relationships are often linked to success. As a probable narcissist, I just gravitate towards what's a good look combined with what I think might feel good.

One of my father's favorite activities is talking about what other people are doing. He enjoys telling himself and others that other people are a failure so that he can feel better about himself. He'll often say someone should just find a partner and other things also linked to success. It's not good thinking to be influenced by.

I have to find an identity I can stick to and enjoy myself, because that's what I've been looking for *all along*. My desire to be in a relationship is just a *misguided* attempt of enjoying myself by relishing in perceived success. I wouldn't actually be able to enjoy myself if I were to be in a relationship because I'm not prepared for all that's part of a relationship. I'm not *there* yet.

So really, while I do feel virtually the same as before I made this post, I have at least taken the step of realizing it on a conscious level.

A lot of the media nowadays can make relationships sound like a commodity. I don't think movies/memes/shows/whatever should be blamed, but rather, we should always be aware that they're written for entertainment. They follow a specific writing pattern that's likely not on the same ""wavelength.""

I likely have narcissistic personality disorder, so I recognize that my desire to have a girlfriend probably has nothing to do with the way people often feel that.

NPD,fqdnym2,t1_fqd0xfe,1589293476.0,"Hmmm, you might be interested in how similar my life was to what you just described some 5-6 years ago when I was in my teens.

My parents started having really bad fights and wanted to get a divorce, which they never did. I took advantage of the situation and sided with my father, because he had all the ""power"" in the household. I helped him in their arguments, which escalated into physical aggression. I admit I participated in that too.

After about a year or so of fighting, my father got a restraining order and had to rent a house. I moved in with him and we lived there for about 10 months before returning home. We moved while my mother was out, so she came home and found the whole house empty. I avoided all contact with her during these 10 months.

My parents agreed on ignoring the restraining order after my father manipulated my mother and convinced her that life can be easier for both if they just go back to living in the same house. It's clear he just didn't want to pay rent anymore.

They started fighting again not too long after that, but I began siding with my mom. My dad moved out to another house yet again for a month or two, but I stayed with my mom this time around.

Nowadays, they get along some 50-70% of the time. They have these petty arguments pretty much daily over silly things such as a misplaced fork, plate, or about nobody having taken the trash out yet. Or linguistic choices. Once in every several months they'll have a more serious fight and won't talk for days, but that's it. They gossip about the neighbors and get bothered by anything the neighbors do, saying they'll call the police and so on as what seems to me like a way to pass the time and ignore all the problems they should be facing.

It's worth noting I'm hardly ever held responsible for anything nowadays. I think the fact that I went up against both of them during traumatic times has left them scared of confronting me. My father in particular seems to be the most affected by this. There's an elephant in the room in a way, and they don't want to mention it, so they only blame one another for things and I get away with pretty much everything.

I think there's a lot that can be discussed here. You can DM me if you feel there's more we can talk about."
NPD,fqbxgyt,t1_fqbtlo6,1589245854.0,"Without giving it too much thought, I think a meaningful relationship would be one where I don't feel like I have to be the best. It would feel good for me to not feel threatened by people who are better off than me in certain areas. The thing is, I feel better than everyone by default, but they are a threat to me when I realize they're doing well in an area I care about. Having had a partner before, I hated the idea that I had no way of knowing what she was actually thinking. If she saw a guy with a motorcycle that's better than mine, she wouldn't mention it, but she'd *think* about it. She would see proof with her very eyes that I'm not the best person she could have found.

I start to feel like I have no control over the fact that she'll think gradually less of me.

Of course, I'm sure this also tells you I define myself by my success, not who I really am...whoever that is. 

I have no doubt this can be traced to my father determining whether a person is worthy or unworthy by their success, marital status, knowledge and so forth, but I'm sure kids I went to school with who harassed me with this mentality also played a huge part in me only paying attention to my achievements when seeking to determine who I am.

But for some reason, it feels like if I were to not be like this anymore, my life would lose meaning. My sole purpose in life is to achieve high status so that I can be worth it. But I guess that's because this is the only life I know for now.

Another thing I want to mention is that I always look for people's flaws. I degrade them in my mind once I find out that they're not doing as well as I am in some area I care about. Perhaps that's where a lot of this comes from - I don't trust people because I feel they're searching for my weaknesses so they can feel better than me. Of course, just like me, they're not going to stick around unless they feel I'm better than they are.

I've felt curious about meaningful relationships, *especially* when I figured they could be what was going on (even though it wasn't), but at the end, I can do without them. I think that's partly because I've never found ""genuine meaning"" in a relationship to begin with.

The piston's downward motion is not caused by a torque, it's caused by a force; but the connecting rod, which is attached to the crankshaft, is already part of a rotating motion. That's where a vehicle's torque ""begins""; nothing to do with the transmission whatsoever.

You're right in saying that you cannot create more horsepower with gearing, but that has nothing to do with my point.

My point has to do with torque being enough to tell how a vehicle will perform. You do not need horsepower if you know the right data.

If you know your vehicle's drag coefficient, gearing and have its torque curve from a dyno run, you can draw a curve for minimal torque necessary to sustain motion at the given gear and RPM.

If your torque curve is above the minimal torque curve at 5,000 RPM, that means you can rev over 5,000 RPM in the given gear. If the two curves meet at 5,000 RPM, that means you have reached maximum RPM for that gear, regardless of where the redline is. You can perfectly ignore power and still have a good idea of what a vehicle's performance is like based on wheel torque compared to resistance (which grows exponentially)."

Again, power and torque are directly proportional, so whatever can be taken from horsepower can also be taken from torque.

The formula for acceleration mentions force, not power. What force do you think that is when talking about cars? It's torque.

Force is used for every calculation of acceleration, cars included. The fact that they have wheels, engines, horsepower figures, or whatever other reason will not make them behave any differently under the laws of physics.

The idea that having higher torque than another engine ALONE is always better is misguided. Basing yourself off a torque curve from a dyno sheet and required torque for acceleration is not."
explainlikeimfive,fpij7m3,t1_fpiig2r,1588642027.0,"Power is not as useful as torque because it cannot be calculated without torque. Like I said in my comment, dynamometers measure torque, not horsepower. Horsepower is merely a product of torque.

If your torque is perfectly equivalent to the forces acting against your movement, your speed will remain the same. If that's your peak torque, you have reached top speed. If your engine can produce more torque than is needed to fight these forces and is doing so, then it's capable of doing work, be it towing or acceleration."
explainlikeimfive,fpii6ps,t1_fpidvrv,1588641418.0,"Engines do not ""produce"" power. They produce torque, and horsepower is only a number that's calculated based on torque. Dynamometers measure torque, not horsepower.

When a cylinder fires, it's acting the same way as a cyclist pressing his foot down on the bicycle's pedal. This is a force, which, due to the presence of a crank, becomes a torque.

So, knowing that horsepower is a product of torque - not the opposite - we know that anything to do with horsepower will go back to torque. They're directly related. If you don't have enough horsepower to accelerate or maintain highway speeds, that's because you don't have sufficient torque in the first place.

In order to maintain or gain speed, you need to fight forces (air resistance being the main such force). Your force needs to be equal to these forces to maintain speed and higher in order to accelerate. So if you're using wheels, this force is referred to as torque.

The engines you mentioned produce lots of torque, but not at the required RPM. In order to travel at X miles per hour with Y gear ratio, your engine speed will be Z RPM. If the engine and wheel torque at Z RPM are not at least equivalent to the forces trying to stop your car, you will not be able to travel at that speed."

explainlikeimfive,fpi36c8,t3_gdei4x,1588632754.0,"Torque is rotational force. What keeps a wheel spinning is a force, and that force is called torque.

When you spin something, you are applying a torque to that object.

Of course, where there's motion, there's energy, so we know that where there's a torque, there's also some energy. Energy in a specific time frame is called power.

Horsepower, as the name suggests, is a unit of power.

Obviously, the more torque you give, the more power you get in return.

With that being said, there's another factor that's part of this - revolutions per minute (RPM). That is, how fast the object spins.

When horsepower stays the same, torque decreases at the same rate at which RPM increases. You can switch horsepower, torque and RPM in this statement in any way you want and it will still be true.

In other words, torque, horsepower and RPM are directly proportional to one another.

The car's engine produces torque. Horsepower is then calculated based on the torque produced and the RPM at which it is produced.

However, as far as combustion engines go, the horsepower/torque figures you hear about cars are not fixed values. These are peak numbers. That is, at a certain RPM, the car will reach its peak torque and at a certain RPM, it will reach its peak horsepower. Google ""(car name) dyno sheet"" and you'll likely find a sheet that shows this.

Now, how does torque affect how fast a car goes?

When traveling at a certain speed, there are forces trying to stop you, like air and rolling resistance. With that in mind, we know you need at least a little bit of torque to keep your current speed, or else you'll eventually stop.

The more torque you have, the more resistance you can fight against.

If you have only the torque needed to maintain, not gain speed, you have reached your top speed. Giving the car more gas will have no effect.

The more torque you have than is necessary, the more potential you have to move mass. So if your car is lightweight, you will take less time to reach higher speeds. If you're towing, having more torque means you can gain more acceleration with more weight being towed.

And last but not least, you might be thinking: how come a 700-horsepower sports car can't tow like a 200-horsepower pickup truck?

Simple: refer back to horsepower figures not being a fixed value. The truck actually has MORE power at low RPM, which obviously means more torque. The sports car cannot start moving if there's too much weight to tow because its torque is less than what is needed to start moving when towing X kilograms. It cannot reach 700 horsepower because the load being towed stops it before it reaches optimal RPM."

1st - 479 N m  
2nd - 313 N m  
3rd - 237 N m  
4th - 193 N m  
5th - 158 N m

The tyre has a circumference of \~75 inches, so the radius is \~12 inches.

I have a dyno sheet for it. [Here it is](https://i.imgur.com/3inqdPw.jpg).

I was originally going to ask how can I figure out my bike's acceleration from this dyno sheet. I know it goes from 0 to 60 mph in \~9.3 seconds (2.987 m/s²) with a weight of \~506 pounds, so I know what results I'm supposed to get, but I don't know what formula will give me these results, and then also give me accurate results for any other vehicle's dyno sheet.

I know that if the engine were to produce the exact same 20.5 N m starting from 1 RPM and up to 9,000 RPM, the bike would accelerate faster due to it having more torque available throughout the entire range, but I don't know how much faster it would accelerate with that torque output.
