Also I think as they grow older they get more affectionate and lazy although I might be wrong. We've tried taking him outside on a harness before and we've trained him to walk on a lead which is superb but we haven't really had the time to do so lately.

And I also get nightmares that keep me awake and it sometimes gets so bad that I'll stay awake for numerous days and just wait until I pass out. For me, I find it easier if I don't think about the things that scare me. It's easier said than done and will take a lot of distraction and focusing on other things but hopefully over time these nightmares will slowly stop. That's the thing with nightmares, a lot of the time they'll come and go. If you have a pillow or something then squeeze it and cuddle it, it might not help for you but I found it somewhat helped for me. I imagined the pillow as someone I knew who I was very close to at the time. It seems kinda creepy but it helped, so maybe try something like that. Or try meditation.
