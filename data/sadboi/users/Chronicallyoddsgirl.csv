5-6 months to get your SKs completely comfy with you when you don't cohabit with your SO? That's a lot of pressure on the kids. They've known you for what, a year? How much time do you actually spend with them? Are you sure this is a reasonable expectation?

And why is it on YOU have to find the money, on your own, to find a place big enough for everyone? Wouldn't splitting the costs of a flat maybe help you get a car that allows you access to your personal support network as well as his family one so you don't have to chose? By this plan, are you going to have to wait until you can afford everything for BK&SKs in order to have your baby?

It seems like you're putting a lot of effort and heartache into trying to get a joint life together and under one roof, and he's not. What would happen if you stopped doing all this one-sided work into making your relationship work? When you have your baby, can you see him making as much of an effort to be helpful and accomodating with your biokid as you are with his kids?

Honestly, IMO, your relationship doesn't sound stable enough to add a baby. That doesn't mean *you're* not ready for a baby, but maybe reconsider him being part of this choice. Go back to Berlin, to your support network, have a baby that's all yours via sperm donation in a flat you can afford. Parenting is hard enough without an unhelpful maybedaddy who can't communicate."

At a guess, from what you've said, his actual kink is making you genuinely distressed. He's been chasing the high of making you uncomfortable, and finally received it, and he's not letting it go. That's why he keeps switching it up, won't respect your no, and won't be open to playing with others who actually enjoy the kink. He wouldn't enjoy it with a partner who actually enjoys it.

Decide what you need. Take your time thinking this through. What's a reasonable amount of time alone? Time gaming? Time with her? What's a reasonable split on chores/cooking? How much can you do and still be happy? Figure out where your boundaries are negotiable vs non-negotiable. Talk to her- give where you can, be firm where you need it. Personally, youtube videos drive me nuts, but you can watch in ways that don't effect her, like using headphones or watching in another room.

Approach the topic calmly. Give her space to process if she needs. Maybe brainstorm with her activities she can do while you're occupied. Encourage her to join some kind of online chat/call friends/ect for company, this pandemic is brutal for people-persons.

AmItheAsshole,fnp5lhv,t1_fnojkp5,1587139618.0,"(Not excusing them, but giving some context to their reaction)

To them, you were rude first. Baby gifting has a whole set of unwritten rules that vary from place to place, that usually gets introduced by your mother/older sister/aunt. You have rough family relationships, so no way of knowing what you were getting into (and imo they're generally stupid rules anyway). 

Everything from who throws the baby shower to how to distribute your registry is part of this, but on cardinal rule is that you *never, ever turn down gifts and ask for money instead.*

To you (and me), it makes sense. You want to kit out your baby as safely and beautifully as possible. You don't want second hand smoke on hand-me-downs, and you want the experience of buying things for your baby. Just money gives you all that.

To them (and my female relatives), by turning down the things they picked for their babies, you are negatively judging how they raised their kids. What's good enough for their family is not good enough for yours? You don't even want *new* stuff they pick. Their money is good enough for you, but their gift choices aren't good enough for you? Do you not trust their decision making with children *at all*? They probably feel like you're calling them inadequate parents. In their opinion, you were insulting and they responded in kind.

Sometimes relationships don't come down to right and wrong, but tact and compromise. Figure out your core boundaries (like no second hand smoke!!! Or decorating the nursery yourself), and see where you can bend a little. Can they buy a small gift? Maybe a book each, with a note inside, something tangible to show their love for your baby, but still leaving you to decorate the nursery freely?"

Was your sister's girlfriend being honest in saying the screenshots were showing toxic behaviour? You mention you and your girlfriend and fighting a lot. That doesn't sound very healthy. 

Try to reframe it a little. It's not her sister hating *you*, it's her sister is encouraging her to stay out of *an unhealthy relationship*. That's not a slight on you, that's someone who wants what's best for your girlfriend. That's a good thing!

The solution can't be expecting your girlfriend to hide it from her support network when things get bad. That's unfair. She deserves support, just like you do. 

The solution is find a way for your relationship to be a positive thing for your girlfriend. Do what you can to create a healthy relationship with her, that her loved ones will be happy to see her with, and they will like you. Do you need therapy? Does she? Better communication? More space to cool down? What can you do to make things less toxic?

And if you can't do that, then yes, walk away...you can't be mad at her because her family loves her and wants her happy. Once you get into the territory of behaving toxicly and expecting your partner to hide it for you, you're heading a bad direction fast."
