Let‚Äôs focus on facts that are relevant. A GF or stepmom is *never* supposed to coparent with baby mom. That‚Äôs for OP and the child‚Äôs mother to do. It is telling that she was doing the negotiating with baby mom for OP and struggling with that (because that shit is impossibly hard). 

Why was he not doing it for himself? 

If OP had done his own dirty work, his gf would never have had an interaction with baby mom in the first place. 

OP has strong opinions on who matters and who doesn‚Äôt. GF would‚Äôve known this from living with him and the way he treated her- her concerns were imaginary. Her needs were the rantings of a traumatized individual. She was expendable. OP let her do his work while he minimized her concerns, ignored her requests to work it out. Then be reacted abusively when she got inappropriate. Ripping her out of the kid‚Äôs life, giving her a day to find a new place to live, and calling her a child abuser was a massive overreaction. It was tossing her out.

She *was* inappropriate. But her intention was good. She was trying to defend the child from a demonized mother. Interesting word huh? Look how black and white OP is about his exes.

She was being used by OP to triangulate baby mom and it backfired because this time baby mom did what OP wanted. It didn‚Äôt occur to OP that GF might have had warranted confusion and upset feelings over this. It‚Äôs very likely she was trying to be what OP wanted her to be. 

Stepmothers and ‚Äúbonus moms‚Äù are constantly held to an impossible standard and if they ever make a mistake they‚Äôre routinely thrown under the bus because they‚Äôre the perfect villains. 

OP got a ton of validation for his abusive behavior. His horrible reaction was heroic to a lot of you. If you relate to him or think he‚Äôs a ‚Äúking‚Äù you should try to challenge yourself to try and see it from another POV."

I am the second wife of a total scoundrel, and while the breakup before me wasn‚Äôt infidelity-related (so it didn‚Äôt give ex wife 1 hard feelings about me), she still hated me the entire time we were together. 

After I left him I cautiously approached her asking for time with her sons, who were my stepchildren. Our ex was being stingy with visits.

She surprised me by opening up, we compared notes on what it was like being married to him, and we ended up slowly becoming friends. We now basically run his ass. We collaborate about our kids‚Äô vacations, and check in with each other before we check in with the mutual ex so that we get our kids‚Äô needs met (he‚Äôs still a scoundrel).

I sure hope you‚Äôre not a fertile male who sleeps with (or aspires to sleep with) cis women. Because that would make you ‚Äúan issue‚Äù wrt abortion.

Get fixed if you are!

Demand the male BC pill!

Lift a fucking finger to carry a fair share of the weight of prevention. Be useful.

My philosophy or religion have NO impact on any other woman‚Äôs body and here‚Äôs why: 1. I can‚Äôt knock anyone up. 2. It‚Äôs their body, their choice."
MurderedByWords,fopq5v3,t1_fopnao1,1587968600.0,"you realize, right, that men run religion...globally? Women tend to be more religious, but men attempt to do most of the lording ‚Äîover everyone who will tolerate it. 

Religious women and non religious women agree: abortion is to be avoided. Those of us who have a religious objection to abortion may still be pro choice. People can be religious and political, you see. Especially if it directly impacts them. That‚Äôs why we have the famous saying ‚Äúthe personal is political.‚Äù

Men really could prevent unwanted pregnancies but they don‚Äôt want side effects or any discomfort. That‚Äôs for women. They don‚Äôt prevent pregnancy because it doesn‚Äôt matter enough to them: it doesn‚Äôt happen inside their bodies. The ones who can‚Äôt even bear to get the snip ‚Äîhow could they ever cope with the pain of an abortion. The only thing that scares a lot of them is the financial risk of becoming a father. 

The argument is about who gets to decide: and that‚Äôs women. It‚Äôs tense because many men, using whatever authority they could muster, including religious authority, which they put themselves in control of *in spite of being generally less religious than women are*,  still desire yet more power over women. Women having agency threatens them."
MurderedByWords,fopoiip,t1_fopnao1,1587967194.0,I‚Äôm a woman against abortion and in favor of men 1. Stepping up and using effective birth control 2. Accepting they have NO say about women‚Äôs bodies.
MurderedByWords,fopn175,t1_foouwn4,1587965958.0,"It boils down to control over women. To put it very simply:

Men don‚Äôt want women controlling their own bodies.

When women use birth control and abortion to control their own bodies, they are destroying what men feel entitled to: women‚Äôs bodies, women‚Äôs agency, a bigger cut of the power. 

Men want control over women‚Äôs bodies and the final say in family planning. And many want it while taking zero responsibility for actually preventing pregnancy. 

Think of all the men who refuse to get vasectomies, some well into their 50s, forcing women they sleep with to stay on dangerous hormonal BC, which becomes increasingly hazardous after age 35. They have no intention of becoming fathers. But if a pregnancy happens, THEY expect women to ‚Äútake care of it.‚Äù 

Side note on accidental pregnancy  ‚Äî100% are caused by irresponsible, fertile men who couldn‚Äôt keep their legs closed. 

Women naturally have the *right* to determine who lives and who dies when an unwanted pregnancy arrives in HER BODY.

That‚Äôs more power than any man has. Really think about this. What man can legally say: ‚Äúthis person doesn‚Äôt get to exist; I‚Äôm gonna end them.‚Äù Not many. A king maybe? But every woman is born with this right. 

Anti choice is about power, about men being so threatened by women wielding power. 

Women naturally get to determine who will be born and who won‚Äôt. That responsibility is intrinsic in being the one with the womb. 

Women who birth babies are forced to carry most of the burden of parenthood. Men are habitually reliant on women to do both the dirty work of parenthood, and all of the dirty work of avoiding unwanted parenthood. 

Most men are way too selfish to even prioritize their partners‚Äô sexual needs, lol. They say things like ‚Äúorgasms aren‚Äôt everything.‚Äù Many of them basically just show up to sex, and get their needs met, & their bodies left intact, and their hormones unfucked with, (which they feel is the normal, natural way of things, since side effects or any, like, *periods of discomfort* are women‚Äôs work. 

But they still feel they should have *the ultimate say* because:

AmItheAsshole,fnksp6x,t3_g25iwf,1587038837.0,"NTA. What a disaster, I‚Äôm so sorry OP. üíî

I also feel bad for OPs mom because she‚Äôs just lost her daughter.  I don‚Äôt blame OP for leaving. But that mom must be heartbroken. She must have offered not to put the baby in your room by now, no?  Even if she did, Dad‚Äôs house is looking pretty good rn because his partner is more likable, and no newborn.

Mom didn‚Äôt have to ask her kids permission to marry or have a baby. But you just don‚Äôt put a newborn in a teenager‚Äôs room so they can become a live-in nanny or let stepdad make sexists comment about training for motherhood. That alone would have me dragging my partner into marriage counseling. The stepdad sounds unbearable.  I‚Äôd be looking for escape too. 

I agree with others who thought mom looks to be in a bad relationship. She has given control over to a person who isn‚Äôt respectful of women and isn‚Äôt comfortable for her children to be around. I hope she gets out, gets her shit together, and that her first born children reunite with her."
JustNoSO,fngylsy,t3_g1k0ja,1586949658.0,"He‚Äôs watching your phone and pretending that you‚Äôre the bad guy because he is honestly very afraid that *you* will find out more about *him*. 

He‚Äôs doing this for the same reason liars stare right into your eyes as they‚Äôre lying to you. They want to study your reaction to reassure themselves you‚Äôre believing it. They do this while appearing super devoted. 

Your phone is scary to him now, your phone has  gotten info from his flings‚Äî that‚Äôs what has made him insecure, not your work schedule.

Change your passwords to something private. And never leave your phone around him! Check for spyware on all your devices.

Get an STI test. 

You are being gaslighted. If you don‚Äôt know what that is, google it!"
CheatedOn,fnfyn4f,t3_g1cbxr,1586918298.0,"Aw. It‚Äôs not bad to feel angry or disappointed, or to wish things were different! That‚Äôs a normal reaction, and the time you invested in him was a significant part of your life. Just like you have probably not always been what someone else has needed (any exes who were annoyed about waiting for you?), now here‚Äôs someone who isn‚Äôt what you need at all.  Waiting for him to magically transform into what you need would be a massive mistake.

He will probably eventually grow and change. Most people do. Maybe he will become what he should have been already‚Äîfor someone else. But there‚Äôs zero chance he is or will be good for you. Winning him back would only be settling. Look at how much he valued you while you were prioritizing him. You want to fight to make someone love you? They should just love you. And be there for you. 

I have an ex who I sometimes dream about. He must be rolling around in my subconscious mind because I avoid thinking about him or wondering about him. He led me on horribly after my divorce a couple years ago. Said he wanted what I wanted, and acted so into me. And I was crazy about him. I thought he was the smartest, cutest , hottest thing I‚Äôd ever seen. But he was selfish with his time and wasn‚Äôt at all giving in bed. He ultimately drifted away when I pushed for a real relationship a year and a half in. Later I realized he was most likely sleeping with his baby mom and I was his mistress. He expected me to wait until I wised up, then I was supposed to go away so he could start the process over again I think. He knew no intelligent woman would endlessly accept the scraps of his schedule that his real partner didn‚Äôt need.

I miss the laughs, I miss his ‚Äòsweetness‚Äô. I miss having someone who wanted me the way he pretended to. But I doubt that he will ever be a good boyfriend anytime for anyone. Like he will die alone; he‚Äôs that incapable of a basic relationship. And if he does figure it out‚ÄîI still don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt envy the woman who eventually gets him because I don‚Äôt believe in him now! And he would never convince me otherwise because he would literally never try.

You get to a point where you‚Äôre too smart to go back to what didn‚Äôt work. Just keep reminding yourself who they actually are. You know what they‚Äôre like. People may wisen up but they don‚Äôt get personality transplants. You can do a lot better than going back to someone who has hurt you! But don‚Äôt worry if you wish he catches face AIDS, or worse; that‚Äôs a normal reaction to being screwed over. 

I hope you find someone great when then time is right."
