However, my stress and diet were impacting the effectiveness of my pill, on top of making my ADHD *soooo* much worse that I routinely forgot pills, so went to the patch for a few years haha. Similar progestin, low androgenic properties. (I was suggested the patch for consistency and being a cousin progestin, seamless transition)

If you see colorful berries Or dark leafy greens listed mid to low on the ingredient list on top of having real meat products in it, the next is to check the moisture, ash, and fibre content.

(The latter is as far as can be reliably diagnosed, due to the massive overlap of symptoms and behaviors from my comorbidities). I'm 28F and only got my neurodiverse Dx in the last year, so I'm learning how to better myself too.

Do you mind if I send you a PM?"

EICERB,fpid51b,t1_fpi785d,1588638461.0,Sounds to me like an exact amount situation. Geared to income and subsidized housing adjust your monthly rent amount based on your last month's income

cats,fpaf916,t3_gc68nc,1588446943.0,Love her odd-eyes! Do you know if she has any hearing difficulties in the blue side? (Since blue eyed white cats oftentimes have substantial if not full hearing loss on the side that has blue)

birthcontrol,fp86dof,t1_fp7xi4a,1588384682.0,"Suggestion for the super heavy periods -- it's clear you're a tampon user, but I'd get a pack of overnight pads, or maxis if you feel you need them. Having a pack of maxis with my Kyleena the first couple months was such a panty saver!! (Granted, I regularly use pads, liners, and incontinence liners on heavily dischargy days, but my choice of those has more to do with my defective bladder ðŸ˜‚)"
birthcontrol,fp85li2,t1_fp81s0i,1588384109.0,"I think you're probably right sadly. For a copper IUD vs Hormonal it's on average $80-150 for the unit vs $250-400 for hormonal. Dr visit and insertion would be around $100-150, atleast up in my neck of the woods. (Bonus points for being only an hour drive from a major international airport). As someone who has provincial healthcare and low income, my Kyleena was free. But if I wasn't Ã¼ber poor, it would have been $250 out of pocket, or $100 through the birth control clinic if I didn't want to go on a waitlist for a free one if I didn't qualify for the compassionate care one xD"

Even before I became clinically depressed I battled with self-image problems (undiagnosed comorbid ADHD/ASD-HF), depression has only made it worse.

I regularly keep huge bags of rolled oats around the house as per my previous college diet of oatmeal, soup, and sandwiches, and can generally get non-frozen fruit rather affordably at SaveOn and one of the four farmers markets around town.

We regularly keep eggs around!! I either buy an 18pk or a dozen at the drugstore (our egg budget for the month is like $5, Rexall sells a dozen for 2.29 on 3 day sale or 2.69 regular. Shoppers (also close) regularly has 1.99 or 2/$5 sales for 1-2 days every other weekend)"

My grocery options are: sobeys, safeway, real canadian superstore, walmart, saveOn foods. Since I'm in a hamlet, I miss out on No Frills but can ad match at most of the above.

Also, you'd really think 400 is enough for two people... until you realize one person eats like he's carrying twins for life ðŸ˜‚ I could survive off $150/mo myself, but I also have problems with stomach and brain communicating.
