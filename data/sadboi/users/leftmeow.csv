It's ridiculous that many restaurant owners in town are whining and moaning and begging for locals to support them, while others are giving out free meals. We each spend thousands of dollars a year at their establishments and we're supposed to risk our health and over spend to patronize them now? I think it's extremely risky to eat out. I have worked in restaurants my entire life and now own my own small business, and I believe it's our job as small businesses to step up and take care of our community, not beg locals who should be saving their dollars to bail us out. I know there are plenty of arguments to mine, but honestly I'm not changing my opinion on this. I have noticed the places that stepped up in the beginning to offer free meals are the places that are getting the most business now. So a lesson for restaurant owners- you have a giant home mortgage and car payments? If you cant keep your restaurant afloat for a few months you're most likely living above your means. Take care of your employees, don't beg locals to do it. You will be getting free government money eventually anyway."
