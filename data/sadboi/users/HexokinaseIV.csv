OP here's some information with credible sources and you don't have to just take the word of a random internet stranger for it: 

There has been no credible research or studies that demonstrate Dutasteride can worsen someone's hair. [Here's one of many studies](https://www.bernsteinmedical.com/research/dutasteride-vs-finasteride/) that show dutasteride is more effective than finasteride.


In my opinion, I would continue with dutasteride. However, did you quit fin cold turkey and get on dutasteride or was there any overlap?"

tressless,fllvab0,t3_fpmj59,1585268478.0,"It's hard to give a thorough analysis of the study because it's not available for free. However, from reading through the Abstract it does give reason to be concerned on finasteride's impact on Testosterone levels. Would still need to see other studies backing up this one.

I would've argued that the fact they only looked at men who were at the youngest 47 a potential confounding variable because men's testosterone levels naturally drop as they get older. However, since they had another group in a similar age range on tamsulosin who did not exhibit a drop in T levels, it gives credence to finasteride being the culprit. 

Theoretically, I can see this being the case due to how the body regulates testosterone levels. Testosterone exhibits negative feedback where after it's made, the hormone block its own production to stop overproduction. It's possible that after finasteride inhibits 5α-reductase, the increased amount of testosterone results in an over-inhibition.

They mention that T levels were recorded every 3 months for a period of 45 months. I'd be very interested in seeing that data especially if it shows an initial rise in T and then dropping to below baseline over time.

tressless,fhp6f9s,t1_fhp5k65,1581783086.0,"You stated: ""finasteride can cause or worsen these syptoms so again this points to a use for DHT in the brain.""

This is flawed reasoning because DHT is not the only variable that is impacted by finasteride. The only reasonable conclusion you could draw from this, given that it's true, is that one of the products of 5AR is used by the brain.

> I've already mentioned how it reduces estrogen which or course is beneficial for men.

Again, this is not necessarily true because the primary mechanism by which this is done is by 5AR competing with aromatase for free testosterone. Moreover, reducing estrogen is not necessarily a good thing. What's important is staying within the normal range because estrogen has many benefits such as being neuroprotective (associated with protection against strokes), cardiovascular health and many more. Moreover, inhibition of 5AR doesn't automatically mean your estrogen levels were be over the normal range because another variable is your aromatase activity. Many men have low aromatase activity so they don't see much of an increase in estrogen and in fact see a rise in testosterone. 

>you'll have to just do your own research/make your own decisions

This is a typical response when someone who is pressed for evidence doesn't have any. If you make claims and can't back it up with evidence then it holds no merit.

No it doesn't because finasteride doesn't inhibit DHT. Finasteride **inhibits 5AR** which results in a decrease of DHT **production**. The issue is that there are other biochemical reactions 5AR is involved with that that can affect neurosteroids.

The cells in your body need to communicate with each other. One of the ways they do this is by using hormones. These molecules bind to a receptor on a recipient cell which then tells the cell to do or make something. If you have androgenic alopecia, that means the cells of your hair follicle have a receptor for DHT (called the ""Androgen receptor""). When DHT binds to this receptor, the cell kickstarts a mysterious pathway which eventually ends with your hair follicles miniaturizing. We are not sure what all is happening during this pathway but there has been lots of research done that has resulted us in finding many of the key players that DHT causes the activation of.

Hence why I provided credible sources of evidence whereas you have provided none. You also did not address the sources I linked with either a counter or research showing the alternative.

/u/gira stated:

>How can you bias your way into discovering a significant rate of (SRD5A2) gene methylation vs a control group?

Your response:

>Science would tell you that the placebo effect commonly has genuine physical changes to the body, which is going to lead to epigenetic changes that distinguish the PFS group from the control group.

Here you're saying that the epigenetic change observed in the PFS group that distinguishes them from the control could be due to the placebo effect. The epigenetic change observed in the PFS group was methylation of the SRD5A2 gene; however, you did not provide any evidence of SRD5A2 methylation as a result of the placebo effect. That's why I think it's inaccurate.


>It may also just be a possible consequence of inhibiting DHT production that would be observed in most finasteride users and may have little to no effect on the overall gene expressions in this biochemical pathway, but that the methylation may be steadily lost over time after discontinuation of finasteride.

Slightly confused here. You're saying that the methylation might be observed in finasteride users but it may have little to no effect on the expression of the gene. Can you elaborate? The whole point of methylation is to inhibit the expression of the gene that is methylated. 

>It's evidence of a partial correlation with unknown causes and consequences that we can't draw conclusions about. They should have designed their study better, that's all

I'll just respond with what I mentioned in another comment

>Considering the rarity of PFS and the tough sell of convincing someone to voluntarily give their cerebrospinal fluid, the limitations are completely understandable. It would be wrong to claim that this is definitive proof of anything but that is not the purpose behind a study like this considering the obstacles the researchers faced.

You're ignoring so many key factors regarding hormones many of which are what make this NOT very simple. Things like binding affinity, localization, signaling method (paracrine/autocrine/endocrine) etc...

>Not only does the fin sides confirms the theory

They do not because the drug has other effects outside of diminished DHT levels. In research, you want to be able to control all your variables and only adjust the one variable of interest. Finasteride, however, is not simply inhibiting DHT but inhibiting the enzyme that makes DHT. This causes changes in the other reactions 5AR catalyzes, testosterone and estrogen levels etc... 

>it has anecdotally been known for a long time in the bodybuilding community that this is the case (with most DHT derivatives giving increased focus and libido).

As you'd expect, I don't give much weight to anecdotal claims made by people who do not have a background in the field. Too many uncontrolled variables. 

>We don't need a direct research in humans for this specific case anymore to guess this.

haha man I wish it was that easy but it's really not. We do need direct research because these kinds of assumptions go against the spirit of science and just display a sense of arrogance when we truly are very ignorant of the body to be making bold claims like this. 

Here's another source backing up what I'm saying:

Also irrelevant to the discussion but:

>Hence why it cause MPB more than testosterone can.

Testosterone has not been demonstrated to do this! Had a great discussion with the professor I mentioned earlier about this and yep sure enough I was making the same assumptions you were and ignoring the complexities of hormones. Binding affinity, turnover rate, Receptor Interaction, signaling method etc... really do have major effects! Here's an interesting study he shared with me:

>Beard DP cells produce more stem cell factor (SCF) than non-balding scalp DP cells (68) and conversely that balding DP cells produce less SCF than non-balding scalp DP cells (69). However, testosterone did not alter the amount of SCF from balding DP cells. ([Source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/exd.12024)).
