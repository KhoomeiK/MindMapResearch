The smell can be gotten rid of if you don't do it that often, but it will take air freshener, candles, and time. It helps to cook a very fragrant meal too.

AskReddit,fesza90,t3_eqix1u,1579370403.0,"I have always aligned most with Libertarian values, but lately I've been finding myself sympathizing with Anarchists. I believe the legitimacy of the nation-state will begin to decay as private corporations begin to gain more authority and resources. People's allegiances seem to no longer be toward their nations, but to their individual beliefs. I think that ""governance"" will eventually just define the relationship between the corporate overlords/ideological leaders and their customer/follower base. This unchecked authority will, of course, lead to conflict; however, I believe it will also lead to incredible technological advancement and more widespread charity. I support all of this happening because at least then I'd get the choice of supporting the causes I want to support without government interference. I am mostly conservative on social issues, but I would rather have no centralized authority dictating values or, even worse, using my tax dollars for things I don't support. I am comfortable with other people living their lives their way as long as it doesn't force me to compromise the way I live."
AskReddit,fesrvkc,t3_eqixvc,1579368370.0,"I went to a private school run by a local church for my elementary years. The school served an underprivileged, majority Hispanic population with some African American and White kids mixed in. I got picked on a lot for ""being White"" at first. They attacked the way I talked, their perceived version of white culture, and what they assumed my economic status was. I began to speak up, educate them, and even adopt some Hispanic cultural artifacts. It also helped that I learned how to fight and got big. Some kids didn't and got roasted every day. The staff rarely ever did anything to intervene. Most of the bullies ended up falling back into the cycles of crime and poverty they came from. However, those of us who stuck together, regardless of race, became like family."

PublicFreakout,f7l848v,t3_dwp119,1573834771.0,"Disclaimer: I'm a young white male in Texas. 

I've had 5 interactions with police officers in my life. 1 was White, 2 were Hispanic, 1 was First Nation, and the last was a group of African American, Hispanic, and White officers/EMTs. Every single one of them, save the EMTs, had the exact same warrior/bully/I'm in charge mentality. They are trained to have it, they are forced to adopt it or find a new job in many cases. My dad taught me early on to just let cops do what they want, when they want or else they beat the shit out of you if you're lucky, kill you if you're not. one time he was pulled out of his car through the window and beat because he ""looked like a criminal"". In my area it's not about race. The police culture is like something from a Nazi movie. Everybody is a potential target for their behavior. Being a cop down here is like being in a very rich, very influential gang. They recruit by showing people how tough they are and how much influence they have in the area. They steal money, guns, and personal items from people they acuse of crimes then give them to their families and friends. It's all out in the open here, but no one does anything about it because the police have their noses in everything- local business, politics, church, etc. This man was very obviously picking up trash. It makes no difference what color he is or what he looks like, the police officer was wrong and his gang buddies came to back him up."

depression,f74cs75,t3_du306a,1573400620.0,"This system is totally broken. Whatever intentions things like the suicide hotline were created with have disappeared over the years. I went to a local treatment facility a couple months ago with suicidal thoughts. I was very obviously in crisis. They took advantage of my state and had me sign away my right to leave. They held me for nearly 10 hours in a waiting area (observation room) with several others in crisis and some, who were coming down off of heavy drugs. We had no access to food or water and those who asked for it were ignored by staff. Eventually, the doctor brought me into a separate room with a chart. She determined I was a danger to myself and others despite that I told her I had not even considered doing either recently. She committed me. I was only able to tell my wife where I was when a kind nurse broke protocol and let me call her at almost 3 AM. I ended up being held there for 5 days in their ""detox unit"". For the record I have only ever used cannabis. I was surrounded by people in much worse condition with much more needs than me. The gave me a diagnosis of MDD and sent me home with an $11,000 bill. Luckily insurance covered most of it, but not all.
I feel what you're going through. It's like the world doesn't care about us, like they want us dead. It's not true. It's just a fucked up system with too many mistakes and too many bad employees. There is good out there.

AskReddit,f0r9hwo,t3_d6aakf,1568877519.0,"My city has a bunch of places, but one of my favorites is Donkey Lady Bridge. The story is that a farming family lived near a river. One day the father (or a boarder) locked his wife and kids in the house and burned it down. The mother came out scorched and deformed. Her hands looked like hooves and her face looked like that of a donkey. She ran to the river to cool her skin and drowned. Now she haunts the river and the bridge that was built above it; seeking revenge on whoever is unlucky enough to see her. 

I don't think the story is based in any reality. It's just a fun thing dads tell their kids to scare them.

I've been to the bridge and it definitely is a spooky place. It's dark and shrouded with high grass and bushes...but you're more likely to see a real donkey there than the donkey lady."
