Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fofxbpk,t1_foexay9,1587744451.0,"At its most mundane, being bored can cause basic dissociation. Think spacing out driving a car to work or back. After that, higher levels of it like derealization or depersonalisation can be induced through sudden changes in your environment or life, or prolonged high levels of stress, or substance use, or certain meditative practices. The more severe types require trauma, usually intense and in one's childhood. So like, I had quite heavy childhood abuse for 12 years and it resulted in me being constantly derealized and depersonalised, but more unusual experiences I have that likely stem from it involve sudden trance states, other identities in my head that talk to me (more like autonomous imaginary friends than psychotic hallucinations), and during difficult periods I frequently lose time and find myself in strange places or can experience (unusually bland) out-of-body experiences."
CollapseSupport,foe6jao,t3_g6wp3i,1587697026.0,"Okay so my comment builds on everyone else's. This is totally normal. The world gives you meaning, so its mortality threatens to wipe away that meaning. Of course, the world and yourself were always gonna end at *some* point, so why does this change anything? Because the temporality of it has unbalanced your life trajectory and likely even your internal meaning systems, and therefore your sense of self. This numbness and surreal feeling is known as derealisation/depersonalisation in clinical circles, meaning a detachment from self and surroundings, and is profoundly common in existential crises. In Eastern circles it's often called ""the dark night of the soul"", and talks about how the prior self has become incompatible with the surroundings, and is destroyed, replaced by this harrowing, empty state, whereby a spiritual journey of what ""self"" means to them is to be undertaken, and results in the formation of a new self. Same story, different perspective.

I'm not gonna say everything's fine cause it's not. But what you are experiencing is valid, and it's time to get introspective for a bit. Relax. Examine the richness of a deep breath. Take stock of your values. Write down some things you feel grateful for. One commenter talked about just worrying as much as possible, and this does work! In Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Anxiety, part of the treatment is to just take time out of the day to worry as much as possible, and write them down and appraise them, and try not to let yourself worry outside those times. I found this made the worries feel hilarious when you sit down and *try to worry* rather than fruitlessly running away all the time. This alongside daily mindfulness meditation helped me recover from major depression and dissociation brought on by climate grief and academic failure.

You can get through this! It absolutely sucks, but you will get through it. Learn to let go, and yes, enjoy the ride. You're on it now, not much you can do to change it, so what's the point in getting worked up about it more than necessary?"

At the end of it all, they basically have a giant ego-shattering acid trip and have to remember what it means to be human again, because the previous system warped it so much, and have to go about creating a new world not locked in the self-hating, greedy, self-destructive paradigm of the pre-Instrumentality.

And that's not technically true, it makes you feel tired in large part because it has a 7 hour half-life, so when you wake up you'll still have a significant quantity of it in your system. Sleep quality on DPH is also generally poor, so your body won't be as rested after a given quantity of sleep on it."
AstralProjection,fnnqbsb,t1_fnnkgny,1587098704.0,"It simply means that your biological sleep rhythm (circadian rhythm) is significantly delayed compared to the norm, so your body wants you to be awake later. Some people have it to minor degrees (night owls who sleep around 2-3am), some to more extremes (like me), and others go in the opposite direction (advanced sleep phase syndrome). It often causes significant social and vocational impairment.

No idea what triggered it tbh. I just remember in my early teens I'd go to bed at 10pm and be unable to sleep until 1am, then months later 2am, then months later 3am. I eventually just grew to expect I'd be up and would use the night to read or draw, and found I was strangely quick and awake compared to the day even in spite of heavy sleep deprivation. The patterns eventually progressed to around 5am when I was 15, and stayed there. Me being awake constantly at night bothered my mother tremendously, so she tried to police it, but all that resulted was my schedule bifurcating and me sleeping two times per day instead, and she gave up attributing it to lack of discipline and resorted to a medical intervention, whereupon it was concluded I very likely just had severely delayed circadian rhythms (I'm an ""Extreme Night Owl""). 

Since then I've gone into the adult world and generally suffered because it's like I'm constantly heavily jet-lagged. If I'm allowed to function on my inbuilt sleep schedule, I generally perform well. If I'm forced to do earlier, it generally causes a massive drop in performance; I also suffer from bipolar disorder (no idea if they're related), and these periods are associated with some of my worst manic episodes. I returned to, and stuck around in, academia in part because of the flexibility it offers in this area, although I still get a lot of judgement as what people perceive to be workshy, lackadaisical, or lazy.

Not to mention that for chronic insomnia, it has the same problem of sleep meds exacerbating poor sleep architecture and worsening it long-term. Perhaps should've added that ya, should be careful how and when you use it!

This lens sees astral projection as a variation of the ""out of body experience"" phenomenon, the key part being the sense of feeling yourself out of your body. Most people who dream emphatically do not experience that key aspect of depersonalisation. They dream of being in their body in various situations. A lucid dreamer is aware that they're dreaming, but most lucid dream descriptions don't have people floating out of their bodies. Perhaps some do, but most do not.

AskScienceDiscussion,fna62lo,t3_g0jbsw,1586791718.0,"Nootropics (drugs that enhance your intelligence) is a current area of research, but its results are still quite fuzzy. Suffice to say, however, if you drop some recreational Adderall, you'll find your thoughts speed up and ""line up"" during the duration of its effects, which has led to its widespread use as a study drug. It does this by activating the dopaminergic systems located in the prefrontal cortex, associated with logical thinking and executive functions such as attention. Pretty much anything that activates, releases, or blocks the reuptake of dopamine will speed your brain up while on it, from modafinil to cocaine (uptake inhibitor), MDMA (releasing agent), and LSD (D2 agonist), even caffeine (adenosine-dopamine crossover), but the effects of amphetamine are pretty concentrated at, well, concentration, whereas these other ones do other things.

And equally, dopamine antagonists or blockers slow the brain down. Take an antipsychotic agent such as quetiapine and watch your brain feel like it's walking through mud. And that highlights the problem with speeding your brain up: if your brain can't keep up, you can start to have ""racing thoughts"" and ""thought disorder"" (word salad etc), which can precipitate anxiety, panic attacks, mania, or psychosis. Because it turns out, when your brain is faster, your fear and emotion centers become faster, too! It's like overclocking your computer, where care must be taken, and adverse effects like overheating are common.

It varies from an idea that, e.g. if Biden loses now it forces the country to wake up from belief in triangulation and be more likely to support a left-wing alternative in four years, to a belief that capitalism's collapse and a refutation of electoralism should now be hastened so that a revolution may be ushered in.

He was basically an adult playing out his inner traumatised child on the world stage in a way that would make a psychodynamic therapist's head spin, and the right-wing, whether intentional or not, basically groomed him for their propaganda until it became too inconvenient *for them*, and dropped him like it's hot. It's just an all-too-familiar story of victims of abuse being eternally stuck in patterns of abuse, both perpetuating it and being revictimised.

Don't get me wrong I hate the guy, he was a dark force in the world and on a personal level, stood against my very existence and moral structures, but by god do I feel sympathy for him. Hope he genuinely finds peace within himself and can confront his inner demons and rediscover his humanity."

Anxiety,fkm75da,t1_fkl38k7,1584322446.0,"Antidepressant anxiolytics can achieve this, though it varies by person and should be discussed with a doctor.

It's like the specific serotonin increases make you calmer, but also more awake. You just in general feel more in control of your own mental faculties, if that makes sense. Alternatively you could look into l-theanine/l-tyrosine combinations I guess?

But yes, minus perhaps MDMA, most classic stimulants don't go with anxiety at all, and MDMA is a bad idea because you shouldn't do it often due to it dumping your serotonin, it's often cut with bad shit, and the comedown is absolutely horrific if you have anxiety or mood disorders."

It might also help to acknowledge that your anxiety is creating a future in your head that you're accepting as real, but it needn't be! And the panic itself isn't actually solving anything. Let's say you now have it, as rare as that is, what does that actually mean? There's nothing you can do. So what's the use in panicking? If symptoms eventually arrive, you know the drill.

Without a sense of awareness, it can seem like whole sides must just be poisoned with hate. It does feel like emotional maturity is the main aspect - an emotionally immature person can't quite hold nuanced views of humans, and a discussion for them isn't an exchange of views, experiences, and ideas, but instead a battleground to flex and establish dominance (or worse, just to simply debase people for some internal gain)."

PoliticalDiscussion,fjx1cdw,t1_fjwwiew,1583652326.0,"Yep, liberal here means the inherited train of liberalism from Locke, Mill, and Smith. And yep, Liberal means the Liberal Democrats. And yeah, Burkean sense of lower c conservative might be right, though here our ""conservative thought"" and indeed the big c Conservative Party follow from a guy called Robert Peel.

And yup, while the UK is more tripartite for sure, it's still ultimately down two lines because FPTP empowers the majority two parties. The entire Brexit fiasco was because UKIP was gaining influence and siphoning off the Tories, and Cameron gave them a referendum hoping to secure them as part of the Conservative base and put the hard side of euroskepticism to rest. But nonetheless, you do have ""coalitions"" every now and again, and the last one from 2010-2015 had the Libdems in power with the Conservatives, so it's not quite as big-tented as the US. We also have parties like the SNP, Greens, and Plaid Cymru with actual seats in Parliament, whereas the US House is entirely Dem or Rep with 1 Independent.

And yeah, I agree, the political spectrum is way too simplistic these days. Boris Johnson here is a great example because in many senses he's considerably more moderate than the Conservative Party standard, but in other senses he's considerably more right-wing.

PoliticalDiscussion,fjws3f2,t1_fjw72o8,1583644374.0,"Not OP, but I have in my life voted for the major parties at least once each so...

Conservatives are the right-wing party. Generally considered ""centre-right"" to be fair, although they've just absorbed the UKIP block and won riot, which we expect will push them much further to the right, but we're not entirely sure what it will look like. See, the party isn't uniform, it generally stands for some mix of ""One Nation Conservatism"" (strong paternalistic meritocratic hierarchical state), ""Laissez-Faire Capitalism"" (full-throttle deregulated no-welfare capitalism basically), ""Progressive Conservatives"" (a mix of the above two with some Labour-esque progressive ideas) and ""Social Conservatives"" (who want to halt progress or go back to the 50's).

Labour are the left-wing party. Generally considered ""centre-left"" to be fair, they went pretty far left in the late 70's and got doomed until Blair, who triangulated them to the centre and then some, then Corbyn took them notably to the left, and now... ???. But yeah, they're a loose-knit coalition of ""Socialists"" (literal ones), ""Social Democrats"" (regulation, welfare, and union-influenced capitalism), and ""Blairites"" (mix-and-match ""third way"" economic pragmatism). You have a spattering of feminists, LGBT activists, BAME activists, and so on across this spectrum, too.

The Liberal Democrats are a colloquially centrist-liberal party. It used to be the Conservative Party and Liberal Party in the early 1900's, but the Liberals got washed out by Labour in the 1920's. Then, in the 1980's, Labour disintegrated a bit trying to go too far left, and the disaffected pragmatic folk joined them under the SDLP. This then became the Liberal Democrats. They generally carry the mantle of Adam Smith and the idea of the least amount of government doing the most amount of work to ensure the preservation of social and economic liberty and mobility. Nonetheless, you get three general camps of the Libdems, one camp of disaffected Labourites, one camp of disaffected Conservatives, and one camp of big enthusiasts for ""liberty"". Together, they're the dominant third party. So yeah, ""Liberal"" in the US literally means something different to over here. Imagine the Libertarian Party had babies with Elizabeth Warren, and you'd get something that resembles the Libdems."
