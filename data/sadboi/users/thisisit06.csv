Husband and I are preparing to ttc #2 and I stopped having a period in August. I've talked to my pc and she thought maybe I was anemic and tested. She said no news is good news and I haven't heard from the office. Has anyone else gone through this? My period just disappeared and I cant even begin to guess when I would be ovulating, if I even am. I'm not sure what my first steps should be to figure it out. My doctor acted like it wasnt a big deal but 6 months seems like a long time.."

I dont think I'm ever going to be the ""old me"". As for the forgiveness part, I struggled with so much anger the first year. I wouldn't say I've forgiven him yet but I've been working on it. Its definitely harder around the holidays though <3 hang in there"

depression,f84z0gg,t3_cml6ni,1574264004.0,I'm going into another one of my spirals and have no one. Sometimes when I get really bad I cuddle with my toddler but I wish I had someone to talk to who would understand. My husband doesn't notice or if he does he just doesnt care enough to ask how I'm doing. My younger brother committed suicide when I was 3 months pregnant and after almost 2 years I haven't talked to anyone about it. I wanted to go to a therapist but they're so expensive. Being a stay at home mom I would have to ask my husband and I'm afraid he would judge me. I've been decorating for Christmas and everything but really it's because I'm trying so fucking hard to be okay and enjoy the holidays. Fuck this disease.
