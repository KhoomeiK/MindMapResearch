I have a cat, not because I wanted to get one, but because I fed a starving kitten living under a dumpster one night after work and she followed me walking home a few miles. I don't think a cat can conceptualize the idea of procreation and parenthood as something it can be deprived of. Reproduction is a result of an instinct to copulate, not a result of a want to be a parent. However a cat that is trapped inside and doesn't want to will become depressed and anxious. 

I believe dogs should have the freedom to roam just like cats, but the unfortunate difference is that because they can pose a threat to humans there are laws which require dogs to be physically restrained. Not only could the human caretaker of a canine risk legal consequences, there are death squads that go around and abduct free dogs and kill them if a human doesn't come pay a ransom within a period of time. I've tried to explain this to my dog but he doesn't understand. I don't want to restrain him but I am forced to. I would rather him do whatever he wanted but our society is very uncivilized and primitive when it comes to the rights of non-human animals. 

And lastly, it's necessary for a cat to eat. I would feed her vegan food because I don't want to support the industries of animal exploitation with my money. Either way an animal has do die for her to eat, and the animals who are in the bondage of animal agriculture have it considerably worse than a mouse who lived free and then one day went looking for food in the wrong place."

You're just crusading for cause that there are no victims of.. It's just art. There are plenty of depictions of men in battle without realistic armor. Besides in real life there are many uniforms that have had armor that was more for aesthetic than practicality. It's just silly to expect realistic armor in art or animation because it's not realistic in the first place. If the US military was forcing women to dress like your second photo, sure be angry about it, but there's not point in when it's something in a fantasy world.
