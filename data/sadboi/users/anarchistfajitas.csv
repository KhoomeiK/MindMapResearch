DebateAnarchism,fqtfav4,t3_gknq5k,1589637844.0,"Anarcho-primitivism is more of an acknowledgement that there are fundamental issues with our civilizational model that go beyond capitalism, beyond corporatism, and beyond ideology into ecology. People who a) speak of it is an ideology unto itself or b) pigeonhole it as some fringe nonsense - are misunderstanding what its goals are and how it fits into the context of broader anarchist thought. Anarchist policy is heavily dependent on ideals. Where one might tale a cursory look and say ""they are going to try and take cellphones"" - they would be doing it a disservice. The more realistic application to the given scenario would be to shift discussions about policy in a more holistic direction. Far from pure utilitarianism, anprims seek to include non-traditional markers of success with regard to policy (something anarchists already attempt to do). Instead of straight negative policy talk about cell phones, the anprim perspective would be to look at their effect on us as a species and how that should inform policy. Basically an alternative to ""we can do it. we will do it."" Anarcho-primitivism is a reminder that the values you claim extend beyond humanity. Its a logical extrapolation of anarchist values to encompass biological life at large."
Anarchy101,fqt6lb6,t3_gkny7q,1589631549.0,"Power is an infinitely fluid concept as are human relationships. Read Discourse on Voluntary Servitude by Etienne de la Boetie. Power isn’t real. It’s not some implicit characteristic. It’s ascribed influence imparted by the people that make up the weight behind a monopoly of violence. There is permission and there is violence. If someone can’t obtain permission and opts for violence in the pursuit of a positive policy goal, they recuse themselves from anarchist values. 

One of the central tenets of anarchism is that it CANNOT be maintained through force. So while it’s true that these questions are trivial in the face of individual freedom - anarchism believes in “power” as much as it believes in God’s power. They acknowledge it only to the extent that an individual human can act on it. People chasing ideals can be directed to do just about anything because the ideal recedes before them. Anarchism removes the assumed hierarchy and encourages free association then sets everyone loose with freedom as their ideal.

Affinity groups will naturally take on structures based around expertise but those are not positions of “power” or “authority” in the traditional sense. Start trying to define your anarchist ideals using language beyond the scope of popular discourse. Even the definitions of words are biased because they all originate in hierarchical societies. Karl Marx ultimately struggled to flesh out his theory without speaking almost exclusively in capitalistic terms and got stuck as the “class struggle guy”. Language itself is a bitch."
NoLockedThreads,fqt54gw,t3_gkspnk,1589630269.0,"Part of the problem is that closet alt right simps change their language to hide their rhetoric as often as possible so they can maintain their safe space. They can’t shield themselves from criticism because they have no defense, but they need to take steps to keep their communities insular so people who don’t know any better get roped in. In all honesty, the more angry people get about otherwise harmless language like “gamer” being used by actual racists, the more difficult it becomes on the whole to distinguish those situations from harmless memes. The harmless memes are the vehicle for normalizing racist shit online and the people doing it have no shame and don’t care that it’s killing your meme. It’s not just “gamer” either. Pick any popular meme and there probably exists a version of it formatted to deliver Neo-Nazi talking points packaged as (typically anti-sjw) jokes. With the speed at which the internet moves these days, things like this shouldn’t surprise anyone. The word “simp” was virtually nonexistent 6 months ago now people use it every day and the Nazis - true to form - use it to refer to basically any guy that doesn’t have latent anger issues toward women.

Give it time and let it die. The more fervor there is around the word, the more hiding space you provide people who *will* continue using that word in a way that will only make this issue worse.

Sorry if you knew all of this but many people don’t and the alt right pipeline is everywhere. Pewdiepie videos literally lead directly to YouTube recommending Steven Crowder videos.

The Assyrians are one of the first documented cases of successful execution of a civilization modeled on consumption. Even the Bible touches on the issue when it describes the story of Cain and Abel.

Defcon,fn8m8ax,t1_fn8f8ms,1586744876.0,I know you won’t step on the Pegasus in the student union for fear that you won’t graduate (assuming you didn’t graduate already).
okbuddyretard,fn734iw,t3_fzze15,1586712369.0,*SCHLURP SCHLURP* Do you have a moment to discuss *SCHLURP* our lord and savior Jesus Christ?
okbuddyretard,fn72gli,t1_fn72b18,1586712000.0,Sorry😔You need to come out of the closet of your own accord.
okbuddyretard,fn727he,t3_fzzzvt,1586711860.0,"Whack-a-mole with angry GRU simps is always a good time. The only thing missing is a dude feverishly spamming a combination of emojis, Islamic terminology, and Arabic script. Bigots are nothing if not sweaty."
thanksimcured,fn70xmq,t3_fznh2b,1586711154.0,This guy makes pretty good music. It’s so weird to see him here.
preppers,fn709q2,t1_fn6iyn6,1586710789.0,How prevalent are the issues with truck leases in your industry? It’s my understanding that the biggest issue for truckers is that they don’t own their trucks and the resulting financial arrangements are exploitative.
okbuddyretard,fn6rsrr,t1_fn5zm67,1586706069.0,Finally! I can only troll the bigots so much. I was beginning to worry I was fighting a losing battle.
okbuddyretard,fn5ji0t,t1_fn5gbxs,1586666552.0,Obviously. Look at all the socks on my feet.
okbuddyretard,fn59juk,t1_fn5937w,1586659223.0,I have enough on for all of us don’t worry. I won’t let footwear get in the way of my gay sex with the totally ironic homophobes of okbr.
okbuddyretard,fn57lpi,t3_fzo1m6,1586657864.0,But I like holding hands with the homies 🥺isn’t that what this sub is all about?
surrealmemes,fn3baws,t3_fz26sy,1586617129.0,I’m feel so threatened right now. Is this one of the monkeys that shows their ass to assert dominance? Nevermind. I’m mooning the monkey anyway.
okbuddyretard,fn1nn6z,t3_fyhwgb,1586565922.0,Boomer is about 12 racisms and about 73.5 micro aggressions😡😡😡 please respect the only generation capable of autofellatio. YOU SHOULD BE WORSHIPPING THEM.
okbuddyretard,fmppf3o,t3_fwmt6o,1586284951.0,"I had to untard, blow on the cartridge, retard, and reboot about 7 (or 8?) different times. This is, as we all know and agreed upon at my sleepover, 12 too many. I’m fuzzy on the details as you can tell (then show if your teacher is okay with it) I had to put in my mouthguard which should tell you how bad the reboots shocked something called my dental service sister. whatever that means. My dental service sister died centuries ago. Anyway, I’m going to lick public benches because I like the taste. Lead paint is a delicacy that gives you this funny ‘shutting down’ feeling in your everything."
soccer,fmov2h3,t3_fwi0f6,1586269045.0,"These are pretty. Dimitar Berbatov was (for me) the player with the filthiest, most consistent first touch in the game. Dude built his career performing disgusting feats of athleticism and skill with the most casual impudence. It’s one thing to make a feat “look easy” its an entirely different thing to be so in-control that minimal energy is all that’s needed. I want more players that make the act look nearly predetermined with their serenity. They’re fewer and further between these days."
