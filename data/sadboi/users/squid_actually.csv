As a sibling to someone with major mental health needs, a foster care worker, and a parent that wants to adopt, I can see both sides of this. Here's the reality, being a good sibling is harder than being a good parent to some degree. In theory the final responsibility for what happens between you and a sibling doesn't fall on you. But in reality, your side of things does fall to you. 

Your parents did not consult you on this plan, much like I assume they didn't consult you about having your little brother. Your parents probably viewed treating those things as the same as a good thing. It isn't. Especially if you are dealing with a sibling that is old enough to know that you are not their bio family, shouldn't be handled as the same as just having a bio baby. 

As others have suggested, family therapy around this and your relationship with your parents would be really helpful.

By the way, from this post, I think you are showing a great amount of maturity and introspection. Respectfully keep self-advocating for your own room and alternatives with your parents."
