AustinBeer,fnscp8g,t3_g3akar,1587218707.0,"If worse comes to worse, why couldn't we start using growlers again? Most people have at least 1 growler sitting at home. I understand that we can't right now because of sanitary issues. But, what if  breweries have like a exterior sanitization station where either an employee of the brewery washes the growler, or the person who brought it does? Then it can be brought inside and sanitized again and filled? Or maybe they could put some sort of disposable cover over the tap as the growler is being filled. Definitely not the ideal situation especially since people would then have to wait while it is being filled. Or maybe people would have to drop it off ahead of time? I just feel like there could be a solution here that might be able to save some of my favorite, smaller local spots."

If you like it that's fine, but I think all sugary syrupy ""whiskeys"" like this should labeled as something else. It upsets me when I am having a conversation with some who says that they enjoy whiskey. When what they really enjoy is fireball, or screwball, or peach crown. If you want peanut butter in your whiskey, then find a whiskey with notes of peanut butter."
