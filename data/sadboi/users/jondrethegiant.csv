TSA has a budget of almost $8B this year and it increases every year. So, my point is that this like most budgets is probably bloated. Throw in the fact that the government is also the ones in charge of making sure their budgets are good basically means they can allow whatever misappropriation they want to occur to go unchecked. So, they write the budget, then they can mishandle some funds here, pay the wrong people there. There are a lot of ways people can do this in the private sector, so imagine a business that doesn’t have to answer to the IRS or the government."
