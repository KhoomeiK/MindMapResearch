Mom,fgeu0p7,t3_exythu,1580709968.0,"my husband was raised by his grandfather. his grandmother passed away when he was 15 and his grandpa remarried. we’ll call her Kelly. Kelly thinks she is Gods gift to the world, and that she knows how to raise my child better than i do, even though she has no children of her own. i finally got tired of it and removed myself and my child from her presence, because of how toxic and selfish she is. i couldn’t put up with it. they constantly degrades my husband and i, and the way i see it, if someone doesn’t respect me as her parent, they don’t deserve a spot in my childs life."
