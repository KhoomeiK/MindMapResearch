I find that sleep can help me put things in perspective. Things might not seem as catastrophic after resting. I know I need good sleep so I take medication to help and I don't feel bad about it.

We had a 4D theater. It had a kids option, Dora, and an 'adult' option, Planet Earth. One lady bought some tickets from me and chose Planet Earth even though I gently reminded her that Dora would be more suited to her young children. She came back hours later and wanted a refund because her kids didn't like the Planet Earth movie because they can't understand ""British English."" ... I tried to explain we can't refund tickets that have already been used unless there was an issue with the attraction. She called my manager over and got a full refund. 

Our power went out once. The automatic toilets ran on power and wouldn't flush, so allowing people to use the toilets would be a biohazard. I was given the task of guarding one of the bathrooms. One lady said she had to go. I explained why they were closed and told her to go across the courtyard to the History museum to use their facilities. She angrily said ""what you want me to shit my pants?!?!"" and pushed past me. Whatever lady. If you wanna poop on someone else's poop, that's fine by me.
