cheating_stories,fermyk9,t1_ferllgy,1579355961.0,"A marriage IS a partnership, it doesn't become ownership of any kind just because it's the next step. And the next step doesn't mean you automatically have a RIGHT to any of these things, it just means you have a person who is happier to give you them - but they don't have to. I fully disagree, if a person strays that is their own decision. They could've done the adult thing and had a conversation about it, found out why, worked on any issues. Going and finding someone else shouldn't be any kind of resolution,   as it creates more problems than fixes, and causes hurt that's not necessary. If you loved your partner, you'd never consider straying/finding solace in someone else. Also ""you're responsible if they stray"" is SUCH gaslighting. The only people responsible for cheating, is the cheater & the person helping (if they are aware of the relationship)."
cheating_stories,ferk2qj,t1_ferj25t,1579354896.0,"Expectations and entitlement are two completely different things, and even then expectations will be different within each individual marriage. Ontop of that, a working marriage will understand that sometimes expectations may not be reached, and that's not necessarily a bad thing, not all marriages are perfect. Your example of a situation also doesn't make sense? My argument was that nobody is ~entitled~ to anything from their other half, least of all emotional or sexual availability"
cheating_stories,ferhs66,t1_ferg8os,1579354048.0,"Feeling entitled to your partners body and emotions is when spousal abuse (and rape in extreme cases) begins to happen. People are allowed to not be affectionate if they don't want to be, and if you're in a good marriage then your partner will understand and not push/offer to help, instead of saying ""but Im entitled to this, it doesnt matter how YOU feel"". If your partner is not overly affectionate, and you feel like it's what you need in a relationship then why stick around long enough for it to get to marriage? And if the problems begin after marriage, seek help to fix the issues, instead of causing arguments over it. It's a very old fashioned attitude to have, wives/husbands are not property of each other and have no ownership - it's a PARTNERship."
cheating_stories,ferff7c,t1_fereyw3,1579353282.0,"Disagree. In a marriage, it's the individual's own decision to display that love and affection of their own accord, not the spouse's entitlement to it. Nobody ever has entitlement over another person's body or feelings?"
cheating_stories,fere9xr,t1_ferdlym,1579352880.0,"But by saying ""performing wifely duties"", it gives the idea that sleeping with the wife is something that OP is entitled to - which he is not.

cheating_stories,ferc8pa,t1_ferb0r7,1579352307.0,"Doesn't matter in the slightest if the wife was ""performing her duties"", as you so crudely put it.

Yeah, I understand too that people are busy but there is still a minimal amount of effort that can be put it. Everyone else that your friends find the time to see, prove that. They find enough time out of their schedule to message and meet up with them, why is it so difficult to do the same for you?

The difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist is that the former TREATS mental health issues with forms of therapy, whereas a psychiatrist is the one who DIAGNOSES mental health issues. 

If you're from the UK like myself and registered with a GP, book an appointment with them and tell them that you're really worried about your mental health and you think there are more underlying issues than previously thought so you'd like to get assessed by a psychiatrist. They should offer to put a referral through for you, and you'll be put on a waiting list. 

Just a heads up though: the waiting list can be verrrrry long, and while that can diminish hope, if you tell them that it's to the point where you're worried about your safety because of how you feel, they may push you up the list. 

Hope this helps, and good luck to you 💚"
