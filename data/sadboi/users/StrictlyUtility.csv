With this being a novel virus, we could only build models on the information we were learning in real time. As we learn more about the virus and learn more from countries that are “ahead” of us in the process, the models become more accurate. Models are nothing more than predictions. Hell, even the model consistently used by the White House has made drastic changes up and down. 

The same can be said for the masks. We’re still learning about how this virus is spread. Initially it was thought that the masks would be ineffective. Then the message became “save masks for healthcare workers.” And now, as we’ve learned more about the virus, we’ve found masks are effective. With new information, we change. Isn’t that much better than *not* changing with new information? We also can’t just stay silent until we have the correct answer. People would lose their minds if the CDC came out and said “We’re really sorry, but just sit tight until we know more.” Sometimes you have to make an educated guess.

The military has been vastly important in this and I think you’d be hard pressed to find someone who disagrees with that fact. But the military and the CDC have vastly different roles.
