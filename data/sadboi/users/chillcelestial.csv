**I think Blacks shouldn't be allowed to compete in sports.**

I honestly have a pretty neutral opinion of black people, but I hold a hard stance of this and it seems to be considered an inappropriate opinion.

I saw that a thirty-something year old black person had broken many world records for sports, and I feel it's invalidating white‚Äôs accomplishments. A white‚Äôs hard work has been bulldozed by somebody who was born black, and decided to play sports later in life, leaving them with undoubtedly the same strength as a white man.

Isn't it the same as juicing for an extended period of time?

If a black had been taking steroids for years they wouldn't be allowed to compete, and everybody knows that blacks have naturally more muscle mass than whites, but yet nobody seems to want to say anything about it?

How is it not banned?

I understand they want to be considered¬†*real people,*¬†but even if they feel that they are in their hearts, it doesn't change that their bodies are built differently and it is most notably reflected in sports.

And by competing, they will gradually push whites out of these sports in favour of more blacks, as natal whites simply can't keep up.

Eventually there will be no whites competing in sports, because why would they? They have no chance against blacks, no matter how hard they train."
