BPD,fksm9r8,t3_fk9tqn,1584493288.0,"Maybe it‚Äôs not your fault, maybe there‚Äôs something that has never been clicked between you and your exbf, some needs that has never been met.

BPD,fkqp905,t1_fkpyoun,1584452324.0,Sorry you have to go through all of these.
BPD,fkqp69q,t1_fkqa24r,1584452270.0,"OF COURSE IT IS NOT OK TO FOR ABUSER TO ABUST VICTIMS. Sorry I didn‚Äôt make it clear enough. All I was trying to say is to be tough to those who try to abuse you. Let them see that you are not the one they should be messed up with üí™ Like you said, setting up boundaries and when they try to sabotage it say no to it"
BPD,fkpydbh,t3_fjtvvs,1584423341.0,"I don think It is about skin color or what you look like. Normally an abusive target is chosen by the prey‚Äôs feeling. They will choose those who seem weak and helpless. Like rapists mostly doesn‚Äôt rape a girl because she‚Äôs pretty but mainly because they think she‚Äôs weak and doesn‚Äôt know how to strike back. You don‚Äôt need to bleach yourself, however, you need to get strong. First by faking tough, then the more you fake it the stronger and tougher you really will become. I used to be tough, my ex-boyfriends during that time were all very nice people. Now I realized I have problems such as BPD so I‚Äôm less confident and self-esteemed, as a result (I suspect), I started to get more related to more abusive partners..."
BPD,fkpxfgc,t3_fjwmo3,1584422424.0,"I would also want to know what a healthy process is during relationship. To me, relationships are always messy and painful to me. I don‚Äôt even know why I kept pursuing it. Normally I just kept saying I want a serious monogamy relationship so if the other person doesn‚Äôt want the same thing we need to stop dating. A lot of nagging I guess? And a lot of arguments about it. Sometimes I compromised because I always think I can‚Äôt do better or I don‚Äôt deserve what I want, but then he found out he really loved me so he wanted to be serious bla-bla-bla...However there were already too many chaos during the former phase so the commitment didn‚Äôt prevent the relationship from crashing. It‚Äôs just horrible.

But of course, I haven‚Äôt have the experience of a really serious commitment like engagement or marriage."
BPD,fklntco,t3_fj591y,1584310702.0,Try to learn a hobby at home. Don‚Äôt stay on social networks too long. A lot of people mastered how to cook during my country‚Äôs lock-down.

For example, if you love singing, join a choir or a small musical group. I tried to engage at work and most people are nice but we just don't have the same values or hobbies. I got some of my friends during a local meetup I found on a social network. There's a lot of apps or FB groups nowadays for meetup information."
BPD,f97zvpc,t1_f978dw3,1575172270.0,You did the right thing. She needs help and she needs therapy to regulate her reactions. It is painful but you will feel better after a while. It's all for the best.

BPD,f8o5m2r,t1_f8lusfv,1574663809.0,"For people with BPD,flirting or even having sex with others doesn't really mean they want to have sex.

BPD,f6zcayr,t1_f6zaf5q,1573314555.0,Yes you are totally right. I really hate myself for being so desperate for love. It sabotaged all my relationships.
BPDSOFFA,f6z9qw2,t1_f6txc5j,1573313009.0,"Thank you. I think it's fair that people have fantasies about others as long as they don't act on it. BTW, you seems like a rational guy, can I ask you another unrelated question? My bf had a list for every woman he dated and he balance the pros and cons of each woman. And he literally broke up with his ex after he listed all the cons and found out it's less than pros. And the reason why he said he wants a monogamy with me now is because at the beginning he seems to think I have a lot of pros to be with more than other girls he dated (this is literally what he told me, not that I'm assuming the reason), which I think he idolized me a bit because he kinda ignored me telling him I might have BPD and I could be horrible sometime. Then now he stopped idolizing me finally... So my question is, do guys all do that? I thought marriage or long-term relationship is hard even for neurotypical people you still need to do a lot of work. And maybe there's a phase of your life that you two just will have a lot of fights and ""hate"" each other. Then after this phase things will be better again. So if a relationship is just about pros is more than cons, wouldn't the guy be easily quit a relationship and find others?? I mean of course a person can always leave their so any time they want, but it's just...So sad and ...I don't know... I feel like it's not the kind of relationship that you can really can expect the other person will be by your side when there's sickness and obstacles...I just don't know how to change my mindset. Am I having paranoids about all these stuff???"
BPD,f6z8ard,t3_dtrejy,1573311944.0,"I used to only choose those very mentally healthy guys, because I'm super sensetive I know who's nice who's not. And I still fucked up for the relationships. After I went to work, I became more open minded and I gave all the people chances and I tried to understand them because hey I have problems too, and all relationships need work... Now my BPD symptoms are way much worse than before."
BPD,f6z7a24,t1_f6z0wk0,1573311112.0,"This answer is quite the case. I want someone to fight for me too, even though I knew it's so healthy but I think maybe because we have been abandoned so many times we just crave there will be someone who can show they truly love us...Sigh"

BPD,f6y4gjf,t1_f6y2lds,1573267367.0,Me too. Sometimes I feel like the exercises I did when I was single are totally meaningless. Because I will fuck up again when I get into a new relationship.
dbtselfhelp,f6y4akq,t1_f6y3np4,1573267224.0,Thanks for these words. I hope it will become better soon.

dbtselfhelp,f6y3z9x,t1_f6xv9ep,1573266956.0,Thank you! It's just when those feelings jump out again it is so hard to use skills to control it again and again...
BPD,f6xoiju,t1_f6wf3pc,1573254222.0,I have the same feeling. It's hard I don't know how neurotypical people endure that...
BPD,f6wbll7,t1_f6vhnrb,1573222464.0,"You can dress up like /cosplay her to your partner. Turning your insecure into something fun So that when you think of her in the future you won't be so jealous because it gives you good and loving memories. And your partner will be so grateful, because, do you think he got any chance to really sleep with Jessica Rabbit, a fictional character? Now you gave him the chance to live his fantasy! And even if your body may not be as sexy as her, he will be just overly excited to compare to anything. All guys know that a bird in hand is worth than two in the bush."
BPD,f6ward1,t3_dt5wuw,1573221797.0,"I'm gonna say something different than other comments here. As a woman who has tattoo and loves tattoo, I think guys who want sexual tattoos just try to look cool and want to feel themselves like sex machines, not necessarily try to attract other girls. A tattoo is a personal expression about their own images or their attitude. And straight guys just loooooove boobs.

I think you should ask yourself, why are you so insecure about a boob graphic? Do you feel like he's looking for other big boob girls to cheat on you? Do you feel unconfident about your own body? Or do you just find it cheesey and no taste? If it is really about the tattoo then you can talk to him and make suggestions, but it is his own body."
BPD,f6w9tw6,t1_f6uwscd,1573221042.0,Imo a grandpa with a boob tattoo is quite cool and I would be proud to have a grandpa like that. Even though the skin is saggy and funny but it shows he must have been a fun guy who doesn't give a F when he was young.
BPD,f6w8juc,t3_dt68ro,1573219976.0,"Me too. But I know I have to respect what he likes. And if he really finds someone who's more interesting than me, it is still not what I can control. I have to admit sometimes I still feel sad because I feel like we are drifting apart. But in the mean time, we can have my own hobbies, careers, life goals etc... We don't need to be 100% the same to be in a intimate relationship. If that will make him lose interests in me then it's his own problem. I'm trying to focus on my own personal life and making relationships just a small part of my life. (Then maybe it will be his turn to feel insecure about me lol)"
BPD,f6w7qky,t3_dt837u,1573219254.0,"It must have been hard for both of you to have so many life changes in such a short time. You've managed quite well by sticking on. It's actually will cause a lot of turbulence on neurotypical people too. You shouldn't be too harsh on yourself. Life is hard indeed. But it will pass after a while. I think the first thing you should look after is your health and your body. Once you manage to plan a better schedule and get used to it, you won't be so tired and all the emotions will fade down a lot. If I'm tired I tend to lose control and forgot all the skills too. Hope your life will get back on track soon! And I wanna say something that may be inappropriate... But your post actually soothed me a little, because it gave me the hope that when I'm older my symptoms can be more in control, which sounds a good news...Sorry..."
BPD,f6w4mgr,t3_dtbjzs,1573216206.0,"Don't do this. If you quit your job there will be several months without salaries which loses more money than buying another round tickets. And you have a life beyond your FP too. My experience is, if I don't have a job that occupies most of my attentions, I would be super easily to slide to an even more unhealthy attachment with my bf. And not having a job will cause more anxiety which will only do more harm to your relationship.
I think you two should make a plan to close the distance as soon as possible though."
BPD,f6sdwpy,t3_dstyzp,1573132449.0,"Omg that sounds horrible. I hope you are alright... I don't know about your relationship, but as far as I see, he definitely cross the line. Physical violence and logging on your FB...? That's not acceptable. And you should ask HIM to leave your childhood house or maybe just move back with your parents for a little while until you regian your power."
BPD,f6sctal,t3_dsuh3w,1573131875.0,"I as a BPD don't. I wish I can been seen as a gender neutral person when I'm in a relationship and guys who approach me get the fuck off as far as possible. But my bf has this problems. He thought it maybe because he was seeking outside validations and attentions. He is handsome, confident and charming in his 40s now, but he was just a plain nerdy guy when he was younger (as I saw on his old pictures). And he was not confident with girls when he was young. 

But I wouldn't consider it's a huge problem if you don't actually cheat on your SO. It's understandable that one feels good about themselves when there are others who express their appreciation on him/her. It's human nature."
BPD,f6saaiq,t3_dsuk9n,1573130426.0,Try to throw away your cellphone and go on a trip for a month. And read a nice book. Dress nice and sit in a classier bar to wait for some guys to approach you. Don't bring any of your contact tools!!! It helps I promise. Sometimes you just need to let the feeling fade a little and some confidence. It's quite normal. Not even necessarily means you have attachment issue.
BPD,f6s9gna,t3_dsum0h,1573129946.0,I switch between these two...Both phases are quite annoying to me. But I'm awared that for a lot of time I just use sex  fantasies as a coping mechanism for boring moments. Such as when I'm doing paperworks...
BPD,f6s8v0t,t3_dsv340,1573129585.0,"Honey, I don't think what you said is ""self-aware"", I think you are splitting on yourself and being all black. For example, you said you lost friends so you will be alone for the rest of your life. It's not true. You still have a long time ahead of you. You will meet a lot of new people and make new friends. Yes, some of them will leave too but hey you are working on yourself and when you get better and better, more of them will stay. And the self-harm thing... Yeah, they will damage your body and you may live shorter than other people. But you shouldn't compare yourself to other neurotypical people. Because you have BPD, which I saw someone posted here said it's like dancing with a pair of heavy shoes. It's already a great progress that you are still alive now! What you did that harmed your healthy is because it's your coping mechanism. It's not healthy but who cares? It made you feel better at that moment so it's actually a mechanism made by your body that try to save you from like killing yourself. Of course you need to work on reducing these behaviors, but don't beat yourself up like that. Even you made bad choices, you can and you will live a happy and fulfilling life in the future, maybe it's shorter than others and with a lot of scars, but it's already an amazing future."
BPDSOFFA,f6s6ym5,t1_f6rzjsi,1573128431.0,Thank you. I think I victimized myself when I discribed him. He promised that he will tell me if he meet another girl and he won't cheat on me in our relationship. It's just me getting confused. I know it's a human nature that people have fantasies about other people beyond their SOs. Now I'm calm I think I should talk about boundaries about these kind of things with my partner in the future instead of making a big deal of their past or what they say. Being a BPD is so hard and I sometimes can't help having paranoids a lot so I hurt a lot of people (;_;)
BPD,f6s663t,t1_f6rz18a,1573127926.0,Glad you made it through and you are on a therapy with a nice psychiatrist. Everything will work out I believe it! üí™
BPD,f6s60l9,t1_f6rz6vu,1573127823.0,I mean if a BPD patient is not in a therapist I don't think she should have kids. And if you are already able to use skills to control your emotional outbursts then it's fine. And I don't even think a BPD who refuse to go therapist or work on themselves should even be in a relationship either. I will still stick to my point if anyone disagree or downvote.
BPD,f6rrn2j,t1_f6rnojq,1573117295.0,What... That's not what I meant! I mean don't quit therapy

BPDSOFFA,f6r5xho,t1_f6r2bbl,1573094523.0,I want a monogamous relationship. But I don't know if it is unrealistic these days. My boyfriend (now ex) said his friends had affairs too in their marriage and they are all well-educated people. And he told me I should enjoy what we have and shouldn't think about the future... I don't know how to cope with the disappointments and I am just confused about everything. I don't know what I should expect towards future relationships too.
BPD,f6qsyph,t3_ds6krn,1573085122.0,Yes! I cried so hard on it. And I feel worse because at least bipolar can be controlled by medication. Don't know where is my cure.

BPD,f6qranr,t3_dskii8,1573083929.0,"When you physically harm someone,you can't say ""I'm not violent I was just angry"". No. It's great that you feel guilty but a physical violence is a violent behavior. Only after you realized it so you can change this behavior. Do you know what wife beaters also say? ""I'm too angry I can't control myself"". You have to realize you are already an abuser or otherwise you will always use violence as a way to lash out your emotions. You cannot refuse to acknowledge it just because you feel guilty. I did it before that's what I learnt. Actually, even for BPD we can still control our act, it's just much harder and more painful than other people so we tend to lash out."
BPD,f6qntkm,t3_dsm1ho,1573081500.0,"You didn't do anything wrong. It's a valid request that you want to be exclusive after dating for a long time. But the thing is he couldn't do it. So it is time that you two break up because you don't want the same things any more. And you deserve a much much better person than a cheater. Just because he consoled you and helped you make some good choice just mean he's a good person to friend but it doesn't necessarily mean he's a good boyfriend or will be a good partner in a relationship. Clearly he has some issues himself. This is not your fault at all. I know it's hard for you right now, but time will heal everything. Focus on your work and your personal life, travel, read some books... When you are ready to date again, date someone single and nice, and walk away when they start bullshiting, because you deserve to be treated well."

BPD,f4yumiy,t3_dm3oei,1571885727.0,They have been hurt by the loved ones with BPD. So they just want some safe venting space. You need to know not every person with BPD is the same. And also they are not the people who are around you or even the ones that you care. So don't mind what they said. Also leave alone those forum/groups because you will get triggered by those words.
BPD,f4qhtgj,t3_dleb74,1571753483.0,"Working on DBT skills for your emotions. Focus on enjoying every minute being with him instead of thinking about the future. Focus on yourself and your life goal. See him as a person that you travel together in the journey of life. You won't be so panic if your co-traveller leave right? Because you know even if he's not going to be with you, you still gonna finish this journey/trip yourself. 

A skill that I found very useful is that I limit the time of thinking about my SO or our relationship, like an hour a day (or other duration you like). After the time go off I force myself stop thinking about him and turn to myself and my own life. It's hard at first few days, but then your life becomes better, less dysregular, so does your relationship with the other person."

BPD,f4k3e5s,t3_dktvds,1571633922.0,"I had the same questions before. But now I kinda slowly understand it better. The thing is, your feelings are important and valid. It's the way that how it developed into that goes wrong, as well as the reaction towards it. 

If you feel rejected, think about why it triggered this feeling, what can you do to solve this problem with your SO instead of letting it develop into blaming. Ask the things you hope them to do directly. Sometimes some requirements are not realistic but maybe you can find another way around. For example, it's impossible for your partner to be with you all the time, but you can ask them to spare more quality time for you every week to feel less isolated. And remember no one is perfect. If sometimes they haven't done something, it doesn't mean they are evil and they don't care for us. Please just communicate than guessing.

I know it's our own duty to take care of our own feelings and emotions. But I don't think we, as a person we already are, can really changed to another person that cares less about intimacy. Even if we manage to handle our BPD reaction, we still are more sensetive and hope there's more care and love from our partners. There's nothing wrong to be a little off rail as a human. If that person cannot understand that, then maybe you two are not compatible and the best way to solve it is just find someone who is willing to offer a little bit more (in a healthy range of course). 

PS: I still hasn't managed to think or react like this all the time. But I think it's a good mindset though."
BPD,f4i1sry,t1_f4hm0eo,1571598966.0,Maybe it's her way of crying from help and understanding.
BPD,f4i16n8,t1_f4hon3b,1571598736.0,"TBH me too. But I don't think it's really important if one can focus on improving their traits instead of the title itself. But I think sometimes self-diagnosing will give you some excuses for misbehaving or makes you feel even more helpless towards challenges in life. Sometimes labels are good for searching for treatments, but people accidentally falls into some destructive mindsets too..."
BPD,f4hb658,t3_dkizfn,1571589878.0,"I feel the same. You should never self-diagnose anything. If you have some questions, go to the psychiatrists. The tests are very complicated and sometimes people lie (even to themselves) to be better or sicker than they actually are. You can't tell it but the tests and experienced psychiatrists will. 

Remember there are only a few percentage of people who actually have BPD. The others are just having a neurotic personality, which seems harder to live in this world but it's not as hard as BPD."
BPD,f48wa89,t3_djv3a0,1571450692.0,"I think for a lot of people they don't know what they really want when they are asking ""a break"" or something like that. So they use words like that in case they can crawl back to you anytime they regret about leaving. People are not perfect. Just let it be and don't over-think on it. It's not important who broke up with whom now."
BPD,f47k92h,t3_djpcd1,1571423512.0,"IMO I don't think you have BPD. BPD is not about having abandonment issues. It's more about emotional dysregulation. Sometimes being irritable is not a trait only for BPD. For example, depression also makes people easily have a rage. But only can a experienced psychiatrist can diagnose you. So it's just my word. 

However, you were grown up in an abusive relationship for a long time, of course there would definitely be something broken left inside of you. But it's OK. Everyone more or less has some problems. The key is how we proceed our life. IMO you don't need to worry about what exactly is your problem called, but focus on solving exact problems and living a happier life. That may require some professional help. But you will be fine. Good luck!"
BPD,f423b03,t3_div5ux,1571326942.0,"I have ever done this once to one of my ex, but I don't think my situation can provide any reference. Because I think she also had some problems too. The end of our story is, I deleted her contact but not blocked her in all platform. The last one month before I did that, I found out she wasn't really responsive to my messages, neither did she send me any messages (we were in a LDR at that time). So a week before I blocked her, I thought, ""hey let's do an experiment. I won't send her any message to see if she will ever send me any"". So I did. A week later, still no messages from her. Well, OK then. I thought she made a quite clear gesture, so I just delete her like that. But I never blocked her. If she wanted to ask why, she could always send a text message to my cellphone to  She used to cheated on me, and ghosted me just because she wasn't sure if I loved her for real. I saved all my poor income to fly to the other end of the country to see her every month, stay for a weekend. But I still felt guilty even now. I shouldn't ghost anyone. Whatever they did, they don't deserve that. So after that, I made a vow that what happens, I will always end a relationship properly. And I won't block exes sometimes I won't even delete them, unless they start to act unrationally like stalking me or call my names. It's super hard to not looking at the your newly ex's timeline or not contacting them, but I always tell myself to be strong and suck it up myself. (Ugh..Do I really have BPD? Lol)

I hope you can get over with it and move on soon. And maybe I can give you some suggestions on it. My last bf (I'm bi) loved ghosting me, from a week to two months, instead of talking to me when we had any arguments. So every time when he did that, I was trapped in an uncertainty. I always felt omg we are broken up this time. But if it's a breakup, there's no closure either. So I always wanted to contact with him because I felt like it's not over. Then I did this thing to help myself get more peaceful: I wrote a letter to him and pretend like he received it. The letter is basically a very nice and gentle thank you for what we had together, apologies of what I did wrong and good bye letter. I send back all his things that left in my place. These two things helped me clean him both out of my mind or my real life. After all these, write a letter to yourself to tell yourself how amazing you still are, think about what you can improve in the next relationship, then make a plan of how your life is going to proceed alone next. If the other person doesn't give you closure, you give yourself a proper, nice fucking closure."
BPD,f41y0ln,t1_f3yti9t,1571325186.0,"Same here. I think all people are uncomfortable with being left alone more or less, so my behaviors are fine towards that. But being rejected or neglected... Boy I don't know where to start..."
BPD,f41xiec,t3_divy41,1571325009.0,"Go to therapist or do some DBT skills training yourself. Get treatment. It's OK that there's no one loves us right now. But there will always be in the future, because we are genuinely good persons. We just have some issues dealing with interpersonal relationships. Let's work on it for ourselves first to prepare for the future love. So that if there's someone showed up, we won't scared them away again. What happened is happened. You need to look into the future."
BPD,f41wizz,t3_diwmwa,1571324673.0,"When you can still do daily routines, you can still go to work, get dressed, eat normally... Those things you said that seems normal, are those most of us cannot do when we have an intense emotions. Some of low-functioners have dropped out of school or constantly get fired from work, because we can't do those things we are supposed to do. Functions are those things you should do as a human being. That's just as simple as that."

I once knitted a small square sample from cashmere and every time I touched it I felt so soothing, because cashmere touches so damn good. Also I may put some dry gardenias because they smell so good. And maybe some pictures of my old happy moments."
BPD,f3x26m5,t1_f3vor4g,1571230185.0,"That's really helpful, thank you! Can I ask what kind of therapy you did? Is it only your partner did it or you guys together?"
BPD,f3x0615,t3_dim0s7,1571228344.0,"Wow, reading the first few paragraphs I thought you were my bf. He likes to leave immediately and sometime ghost people when he feels overwhelmed, whether it's work or me. Every time he does that my emotion goes from a ripple to a huge wave. I really do want to respect him for taking care of his own feeling, but it's so hard. So it ends up to be the most dramatic relationship I have ever had...

About the things you asked, I think if you want to break up with her, you should go NC to her. And ask her to do a test. If the kid is yours, then you should take your responsibility on it. Maybe sign a contract with her about what kind of support you will going to offer, and how often you will see the kid, in case it ends up bad. But about your ex, you shouldn't maintain any relationship with her besides your kid's mother before she is over you and can see you rationally."

BPD,f2j3w9n,t1_f2f2igj,1570266886.0,Thank you. After a good sleep I realized that I have to admit that it's still because of what I have done that makes my SO got distressed and alert on my negative feelings. I think you are right about the pattern. I will try to change the way I react first but it's quite hard and will take a long time I assume.
BPD,f2j38g7,t1_f2fxw9b,1570266606.0,"There is always someone who can see your shining spot. Our life is long enough to get in touch with enough people to find the one out. In the mean time, we need to try to make us a better person. There's not such thing as ugly for a guy! Try working out and building muscles. It's are a good way to make you look better and also can give you confidence on yourself."
BPD,f2epzni,t3_dcg4i6,1570201557.0,I had done this all the time. That's how I ruined my job and all my hobbies. I don't want to be in this relationship anymore because it is so tiring even though the reason is me.
BPD,f2eg69n,t3_dd67wx,1570194333.0,"I've actually literally thought about what is real love. To me it means: 

1. I still want to have sex with them and physically attracted with them

2. I admire them as a person instead of just romantic feelings. There are something really nice on them, such as they are talented or caring for society etc.

3. I feel safe and calm deep inside when I'm alone. No matter where they are I believe there's love in there that I don't need to worry or be panic about anything.

4. I can be focused on my own stuff and plan, and I can feel this love is nurturing me. Whenever I think of them I am motivated."
BPD,f2efoho,t3_dd45an,1570193906.0,"I did for several times, but not because I am afraid of being along. The reason is because I cannot distinguish a normal relationship to an abusive relationship. Especially since I knew the word BPD, I tend to think it's all my fault and all the feelings I have are invalid and irrational. I think I am the bad person in all my relationships. So I always ran back and apologized to them."
BPD,f2932lt,t3_dcklry,1570078778.0,"It's more like: you smell something burning and you think it's fire, a huge one that could destroy the whole house and even every building around it. Then your buddy didn't agree with you. Then you can't take this worry any more and lashed out finally. After an hour, you realized it's just your neighbor doing barbecue in his yard and burnt a piece of meat."

Now it bothers you it means you haven't take care of yourself first. I suggest you stop connecting with her for a while until you are totally out of this feelings for now. After all it's her own life you should respect her and believe she has the ability to make her own life better."
BPD,f2467y4,t3_dbnf5j,1569945624.0,"You are doing the therapy to help yourself. You shouldn't think about the relationship now because your first priority should always be taking care of yourself first! Do that treatment, accept that life is unpredictable and uncontrollable. Besides, love is like holding sand in your palm. If you squeeze your hand harder, the sand will fall out faster. You need to let go and accept the uncertainty."
