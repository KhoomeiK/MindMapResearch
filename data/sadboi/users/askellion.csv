LineageOS,flmxv8a,t1_fllv1zg,1585301272.0,Ran into the exact same problem. Better give them time to make it stable before flashing it on our devices

LineageOS,flksybl,t1_flkn4vh,1585247097.0,Got the same problem about the lockscreen.
LineageOS,flksub9,t1_flknidv,1585247038.0,Well 16.0 works fine on my model.

Cameras,fgfflhp,t1_ffy71io,1580737309.0,The thing today is that manufacturers updates their bodies more often than let’s say 10 years ago. So if you want to buy a camera and you have specific needs you kinda want to consider the year it came out in so you can look at your options or try to predict if a new model is going to be released soon
Cameras,ffw3rbk,t1_ffw2jvt,1580283031.0,"Alright so basically I really like the physical dials on the camera, and the colors it produces. I’ve been in stores that still sell it, I had the opportunity to get it in my hands and I was very pleased. I also wanted the IBIS and strong video features : 120 frames per second and Log. The main reason why I’m looking at this particular model is that I want something that’s going to be an extension of my arm for street photography purposes, something that’s not going to be in the way."
LineageOS,f3l9i0j,t1_f3kjlui,1570973768.0,"Reporting back, I followed the steps mentionned in the subject you linked, and now Pixel Launcher works flawlessly. Thanks again !

> What are the exact Open GApps & LineageOS build dates please?

About the builds, I initially flashed LineageOS 20191012 + Open GApps 20191011. Since the same LineageOS build worked with an older Open GApps one, it appears the culprit is Open GApps like you said in the beginning."
LineageOS,f3kl8xl,t1_f3kjlui,1570966901.0,"> Which Open GApps package & build date did you successfully installed? 

I installed 20191006.

> See [*Pixel* *launcher* crashes on android 9](https://github.com/opengapps/opengapps/issues/727) (#727) for the permission fix or select Trebuchet as the default launcher in Settings > Apps & notifications.

Will do, thanks"

LineageOS,f3jpld9,t1_f3jl4o0,1570956397.0,I was using the latest packages yes. I will try this right now and follow up in a few moments.
