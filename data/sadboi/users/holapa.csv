I had a friends with benefit that I became completely obsessed with at one point (2017) and he ghosted me 6 months later. I lived with my best friend and I became so insecure I would accuse her of doing things behind my back and having constant panic attacks about our friendship.

Example: I am in the rave scene and have a lot of friends I go to festivals with. One particular girl (that‚Äôs not in my group of friends anymore because of how problematic she is) reaches out to me and asks fo she can join us. I say sure because I don‚Äôt wanna be the person to say no and piss her off. She then proceeds to argue with me about things like hotel price and etc for this particular festival. I don‚Äôt give her a chance to walk all over me. I tell her no, and delete her off everything. Kinda extreme but I don‚Äôt like people who are entitled and problematic for no reason. 

This has happened quite a few times. I meet someone. They‚Äôre fine. I hear things about them that‚Äôs questionable, but I don‚Äôt let it effect me. They either end up being completely fine, or they do something that triggers me and I just remove them from my life completely."

Even though I‚Äôm not in high school anymore, I relate heavily to her substance abuse and her infatuation with her best friend. Towards the end we find out she *spoiler* is bipolar and that just made me love that show and Zendaya‚Äôs portrayal of that character even more. I cried when I finished it. I never binged a show as quickly as that and I highly recommend everyone watch it."
BPD,fl0uped,t3_flogg9,1584716138.0,"ooof I feel this. Unless it‚Äôs my FP, I tend to pick fights with people who stand me up or bail on me. I lived with my FP for years so I guess I‚Äôm a bit more understanding but even at first I‚Äôd go off on her when she did things without me. Now not so much, but if I reach out to people and they ignore or just avoid me I tend to react quickly and block them on everything. My current roommate is blocked on all socials for that reason (but also things she did). 

I‚Äôm trying to find things to do with my FP while I‚Äôm back home and since she still works she doesn‚Äôt have much free time and I‚Äôm trying so hard to not let it affect me mentally, but when I saw her drinking with her roommates last night and not invite me I got super sad. It makes me feel like they all like each other more than me. I did everything to not pick a fight and hid my emotions under sarcasm, but why didn‚Äôt she ask me if I wanted to spend the night?

BPD,fkdhu1u,t3_fhhwvo,1584079330.0,"Growing up I had 1 best friend and when I got to high school I had like 2-3 really good friends. When I graduated I spiraled and became extremely paranoid and dumped all of my friends. So for a good year or two I had no one. Not a single friend I could really rely on. There were people here and there I‚Äôd talk to but no one I could connect with on a deeper level. That was until I started raving and met my FP and best friend. Since then my relationship with people and myself has improved significantly. Now I literally have dozens of friends in multiple places. I still feel very introverted and have my one best friend I tell everything to, but I now have a much larger group of good friends I can go to on any given day and do casual things with when I‚Äôm bored or free. The scene has helped my mental health a lot and has helped me find people like myself that will love and support me unconditionally."

BPD,fit04v4,t3_f9hwwa,1582699008.0,HELLO FELLOW FRIEND WITH SAD AND BPD. You are the first person here with the same exact diagnosis as me! Not sure if that‚Äôs something to be proud or excited about but I am glad there are others with the same wiring in their brain as myself. I also get emotional when people reach out to me during my period of isolation. I want to be alone but the thought of people going out of their way to reach out to me cancels out a lot of my insecurities. When people say they miss me and want to see me makes me fee valued and wanted which ends up with me crying happy tears.
BPD,fisx3at,t3_f9i41z,1582695963.0,"Splitting for me isn‚Äôt so much as ‚Äúinternal‚Äù but more... passive? Usually splitting is aggressive and a constant battle of good and bad. Right and wrong. As a quiet borderline it‚Äôs more like ‚Äúwow you‚Äôre a great friend I love you never leave me‚Äù one day and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre manipulative and negative and terrible and toxic please leave me alone‚Äù the next. and then I ghost. So really just a lot of ghosting. Me isolating myself and pushing people away because I feel like they‚Äôve become a terrible influence in my life. Sometimes I‚Äôm right and they are, but usually I‚Äôm not and they‚Äôre left confused. It‚Äôs very hard to determine what‚Äôs in my head and what‚Äôs real and I‚Äôm constantly asking others to validate my concerns because I feel very guilty afterwards once I‚Äôve pushed that person away."

BPD,fhg8fd8,t3_f2rwak,1581560969.0,I‚Äôve been like this my whole life. While I know I am an introvert this coping mechanism is how I picture quiet BPD types to express themselves.  We‚Äôre seeing a lot more of these ‚Äúquiet‚Äù or ‚Äúloud‚Äù  types in the community and I very much relate to all the symptoms of a quiet BPD.
BPD,fhfhaif,t3_f2t6od,1581543358.0,my best friend is my FP and at times I‚Äôll start to doubt and question our friendship and why she does or says certain things (or general insecurities of mine come up). this may be unhealthy but anytime her and I have a positive interaction I‚Äôll screenshot the message and put it in a special file on my phone with a bunch of other screenshots. whenever I feel like she‚Äôs being fake or I get these feelings of insecurities I‚Äôll look back at those messages and remind myself that she‚Äôs my best friend for a reason.
MDMA,fhavywe,t1_fhaq9vr,1581428562.0,there won‚Äôt be personality or behavioral change but there will be a significant change to cognitive abilities like memory if you don‚Äôt take at least a month between breaks. I too was at a point where I‚Äôd drop every other week and it‚Äôs not only a waste of money but my memory has taken a major dip.
MDMA,fhavufo,t1_fhatuy3,1581428464.0,MAPS has done studies on MDMA on people with PTSD. not sure how long they waited before each session in therapy but the dose was significantly lower than what people use recreationally. I‚Äôm thinking around 50-70 mg.
BPD,fgixoc8,t3_eyr33x,1580833102.0,This might not be encouraging but I find peace in knowing that life is just a distraction. Finding meaning in things like hobbies and work is just a way to stay distracted and keep on moving. One day none of it will matter. You just go about your day doing the little things that bring satisfaction and joy. For me it‚Äôs listening to Alan Watts on the way to work in the morning and then going to the gym to let out my frustrations.
birthcontrol,fghz5h9,t1_fghvcfw,1580798633.0,Girl what‚Äôs crazy is that from reading people‚Äôs experiences a lot of them did get medicated before!

BorderlinePDisorder,fghuhs0,t3_eyko6m,1580794237.0,"Hey there, I‚Äôm in your position as well! I‚Äôm a 23 year old female (will be 24 soon) and I feel robbed of my teen years because of my BPD developing in an unhealthy way. I have these moments of existential crisis thinking about how nothing will exist in 100 years. Not you or I or anyone. And it fills me with anxiety. 

You know what though? I‚Äôm only 23. You‚Äôre only 21. And for now, we‚Äôve got today. Nothing‚Äôs promised. Nothing‚Äôs certain. And like you said, things are changing constantly and quickly. Who‚Äôs to say that our lives won‚Äôt evolve into something great and rewarding in 6 months? A year? Anything is possible. I don‚Äôt mean to sound cheesy, but despite my diagnosis, my life has been on an upwards trend. Sometimes there are dips. That‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs still looking better even in dark times. There‚Äôs still hope and every day I‚Äôm closer to my goals. Please, just keep pushing. No matter what. Because one day you will find meaning"
BorderlinePDisorder,fghtvxa,t1_fgheatd,1580793728.0,"Not OP, but would like to add that when I‚Äôm feeling a little manic I begin taking 5HTP which is a precursor to serotonin and you can easily find these vitamins in any grocery store / pharmacy. I take the chewy ones every night before bed and it helps me achieve a deeper level of sleep."
birthcontrol,fghtbsn,t3_eykh7g,1580793269.0,This was exactly my experience too! I was holding the nurses hand through the procedure and I grasped it so hard my hand started to cramp and do all kinds of weird things. Then I started hyperventilating and once I heard that *pop* I nearly passed out. Threw up a couple times. The planned parenthood I got it at had massage chairs. I passed out on it for like two hours.

BorderlinePDisorder,fghqjsz,t3_eyghh8,1580791095.0,"I‚Äôve never met another person with BPD so I can‚Äôt say for sure what will work best, but with any friendship I think honest communication is always key regardless of circumstances. If you‚Äôre both open about what you look for in your friendship (something where you see each other every day or only once a week) then you can both find a good middle ground. I know that living with my FP was the most fun I‚Äôve ever had but it also drove us apart because of my constant need of attention and approval. That‚Äôs not healthy and talking about it could have solved things, but I ran and like every relationship when you don‚Äôt tend to it, it will fade."
BorderlinePDisorder,fghq1ey,t3_eyj480,1580790724.0,"Hi there! Hope you‚Äôre doing better! Another form of release that won‚Äôt harm you permanently would be like popping a rubber band on your wrist. I know it can be tempting (I struggle with starving myself every day) but I need you to know that these feelings will pass. Try to remind yourself of the things that bring you joy. The things that bring you comfort. The things that you are passionate about. Forget about the rest of the world, think about yourself and how you can turn things around. You‚Äôll find yourself again, friend."
BPD,fggy8qv,t3_eycbbh,1580772261.0,I made it my goal to workout everyday Monday - Friday after work and I stuck to it!

BPD,fgftwnr,t3_ey6wga,1580747515.0,"Yes but I‚Äôve learned that I only show symptoms with people I‚Äôm close to. I lived with my FP for two years so she saw and experienced the worst of my BPD. Now that we‚Äôve moved away from each other, my current roommate is the one dealing with my symptoms. And it‚Äôs so frustrating having to explain myself to someone who thinks they understand illnesses but knows nothing about mental disorders beyond depression and anxiety. It‚Äôs so much more than that and it is so annoying having to remind her of my splitting or my mood swings. Makes me wish I lived alone."
BPD,fg6z8xi,t3_ewtls8,1580580308.0,"I lost quite a bit of weight. I also put on some muscle. I‚Äôm told all the time I‚Äôm very fit and attractive. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 petite and very cute. I know this and I know that I am attractive, yet I still wake up feeling like a piece of shit. Not about my looks though. I feel like my looks are irrelevant at this point. I feel like people either think I‚Äôm annoying or are jealous of me for my weight loss. I‚Äôm an extremely understanding and empathetic person so the moment I feel like someone dislikes me I feel guilty. Assuming that everyone‚Äôs jealous of you is a bit of a narcissistic ideal, but it goes with your ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm better than everyone else‚Äù way of thinking. I‚Äôm nice and pleasant and social around others and even a bit shy and quiet so there isn‚Äôt any reason for people to be passive aggressive towards me but some people are and I assume it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre intimidated of me. I don‚Äôt know, this all sounds weird and like I‚Äôm trying to be humble but I‚Äôm genuinely super self conscious so when people point out how fit I am it makes me feel uncomfortable. Yet I know some of my friends look up to me. It‚Äôs all so confusing."
BPD,fg6whhb,t3_ex0a5n,1580578490.0,"I‚Äôm pretty deep into the rave scene and I‚Äôm part of various groups of people that attend local shows on a regular bases. I‚Äôm great friends with them all and see them almost as like family... but I cannot stand socializing every day or even every weekend. They go out every single weekend. Wednesday are ‚Äúwine‚Äù nights and Friday‚Äôs are for going downtown. I love them and they invite me out constantly but I definitely love being alone, in bed, watching Netflix. If it ever gets to a point where I start to feel forgotten I‚Äôll get upset and insert myself again. It‚Äôs a cycle of going out then isolating then going out again then isolating myself again. It‚Äôs times like this where I‚Äôm glad I go to school and use that as an excuse to stay in."
BPD,fg38xir,t1_fg2jl0c,1580474749.0,"trust me, I get it. it‚Äôs so exhausting constantly trying to keep people around. constantly wondering if anyone actually likes me. always worried that I said or did the wrong thing. always lowering my boundaries to help others and it‚Äôs never reciprocated. So I stopped being nice and just assumed everyone‚Äôs hates. I‚Äôll give them a reason to if I find out someone doesn‚Äôt like me."
BPD,fg1mjyg,t1_fg1m3va,1580429804.0,I totally understand and I‚Äôve had those feelings too. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre trying to be there for her. Being aware of your emotions is already a step in the right direction!
BPD,fg1lduv,t3_ewbd1s,1580429186.0,I used to have this way of thinking. ‚ÄúI should complete you! I should be your everything! Why are you sad if I‚Äôm right here and I‚Äôm all you really need!‚Äù and I know it‚Äôs hard to understand why she might feel so empty at the loss of someone but instead of dismissing her feelings make her feel loved and wanted just as much as you would want to feel validated. she will appreciate you being supportive and empathetic.
BPD,fg1kdxk,t3_ewe2qa,1580428670.0,"I don‚Äôt go above and beyond, because if someone pisses me off I definitely have just the right thing to say to make sure that friendship is over. I‚Äôve been brutally harsh and aggressive when someone upsets me or makes any type of judgement that isn‚Äôt constructive. If I feel disrespected or abandoned in anyway my emotions shut off and that‚Äôs when I stop giving a fuck if they still like me or not."
BPD,fg1jz0m,t3_eweabd,1580428468.0,"I‚Äôve been in that situation where my FP ghosts me or ends the friendship because of my behavior. You have to understand that other people have struggles too and sometimes our actions carries a weight heavier than we intended when we unload our emotions onto other people. Instead of threatening to hurt yourself or actually hurting find a distraction or a harmless form of release like snapping a rubber band. You cannot take this out on yourself! If that is the choice your FP made they will have to live with it. You cannot control how others react, but you can control how you react."
BPD,ffxc26v,t1_ffw55y1,1580322076.0,"Oh no I gave my FP distance and did things on my own as a way to distract myself from whatever she was doing that was causing those emotions. I lived with my FP for two years so we saw each other and did things together every single day. So whenever she‚Äôd go off and do something without me is when I‚Äôd throw my fits. If she went on dates, hung out with friends, went to the movies, or went out without me I‚Äôd get passive aggressive and be very petty towards her. So finding my own friends and doing things on my own helped but eventually it led to me just moving out and us not living together anymore because I didn‚Äôt see those emotions leave me any time soon. It‚Äôs best now if her and I are friends from a distance as bad as that sounds."
BPD,ffw0vjx,t1_ffw013a,1580279709.0,"I find that going to the gym daily helps with a lot of my anxiety and keeps me pretty busy, but there‚Äôs only so much 1-1.5 hours at the gym can do. I spent 2 hours today and it just wasn‚Äôt enough. I could spend all day there. I don‚Äôt keep up with a lot of my hobbies because I tend to fall in and out of them a lot (if that makes sense). I wish there was a way I could release the things I keep pent up without hurting myself or others."
BPD,ffvz2bc,t3_evika8,1580277837.0,"When I first met my FP I was obsessed with her and jealous of the attention she got from everyone especially other guys. She had lost a significant amount of weight so she gets a lot of validation on social media too. I am happy that my best friend worked so hard to get herself into shape,  but I obsessed over how much attention she got to the point where I‚Äôd cry and throw fits if she slept with someone after a night out. I got over those feelings but it took me moving out and finding my independence again to feel things clearly. My feelings for my FP has also evolved into a more familial love and not romantic love. So I don‚Äôt express my affection towards her the way I used to, but having a bit of distance and even maybe muting your FP on social media helps alleviate seeing some of that attention."
BPD,ffvy3ke,t3_evgybk,1580276874.0,"This is me but maybe even slightly worse. The moment I see a situation arise that can potentially change the nature of my relationship with someone I... ghost. My best friend from high school got knocked up at 18 by some guy she barely knew. I slowly stopped talking to her until I pretty much replaced her with someone else. Anyone I date that has anything I believe could get in the way of the relationship (distance, politics, beliefs) I drop them. I don‚Äôt mean to. It kind of just happens. On the flip side though, if there‚Äôs someone I really like and really want to be with and they show any sign of abandonment, even as small as leaving me on read, I will spiral uncontrollably. There is no happy middle. I hate being this way. It‚Äôs so toxic and hypocritical."
BPD,ffrpzjw,t3_eusqqh,1580163247.0,I‚Äôm 23(f) and diagnosed almost a year ago! I never had anger problems or outbursts until recently either and I‚Äôm finding it harder to meditate and find that peace you speak of. I‚Äôd love to chat about your experiences and hopefully gain a friend with BPD!
BPD,ffjehnm,t3_etptdr,1579996559.0,"At one point, my best friend was my FP and I was in love with her and no one knew. So I did absolutely everything I could to prove to her that I was best for her and that my loyalty was unmatched. I broke every boundary and went above and beyond for her hoping one day she would love me back as hard. The problem here is that she‚Äôs not gay and I would take things too far by manipulating her other friendships. No matter how many friends I had, no matter how many people told me they loved me, if it wasn‚Äôt my FP then I didn‚Äôt care. Thankful I‚Äôve moved away and we‚Äôre friends from a distance, but moving on and starting over was the hardest and best thing I‚Äôve ever done. Now I‚Äôm with someone who‚Äôs actually into me and wants to match my effort and love. Yes, it is selfies, but it is also dangerous and you need to find a group of supportive people to distribute all those feelings onto."
Odesza,fdqabhi,t3_emf2ib,1578661011.0,Buku. That was my first Odesza set. My first festival. My first time in scene. My first everything. I was 18 and absolutely in love. That weekend changed my life. I do not have a single video from this festival. Thank you üò≠
BorderlinePDisorder,fbtlkvy,t3_eeafab,1577083670.0,"Yeah but it always comes from a good place and not *intentionally* a form of self-sabotage.

Mental health is getting bad? Let me just stop drop out of school which will cause me my financial aid and any chance at an affordable education in the future. My friends don‚Äôt like me and I‚Äôm alone? Let me sell all of my things and move to a different city 5 hours away with less than $500 in my bank account. My job is abusing me and making me work under the table? Let me leave and struggle to pay my bills while I find a new job. 

I really fucking hate my way of thinking sometimes."
BorderlinePDisorder,fbt79mj,t3_eed5g3,1577070211.0,This has only happened to me once. When my best friend and I ended our friendship while we still lived together. The week or so after that friendship ended brought on so much anxiety I would wake up in a panicking sweat every night. I eventually went back to therapy because of it. I got on some anti-anxiety. Not sure if it did anything as the night sweats only lasted a week but I got off of them when they stopped.
BorderlinePDisorder,f3f6dnw,t3_dgu2bb,1570890440.0,"Before therapy, I started doing basic self-care things like going to bed early, waking up early, doing some yoga, working out, and having a well balanced diet. Those seem like obvious things everyone should do, but for me it gave me a sense of purpose. It helped clear my mind and achieve my goals. I realized it wasn‚Äôt enough because even though my symptoms were contained, I was still suffering from severe anxiety and splitting whenever the trigger arose. So all of those things combined with therapy pretty much nearly cured me. I had someone to vent to and talk to that wasn‚Äôt going to judge me. I read books on DBT (which are insightful), but I have yet to actually try it with a therapist."

ElectricForest,esk4ony,t1_esi74aa,1562051250.0,Someone brought in fireworks during Snails and it went off while they were sitting. We hear a loud pop and some sparks but def could have triggered those on drugs around them.
BorderlinePDisorder,eq3jxv1,t3_bx08wn,1559757394.0,"This is much appreciated. I‚Äôve struggled with my self-worth and self-esteem, but I was never paranoid until these last few months. I thankfully am over it, but my insecurities grew so big I began to accuse my closest friends of terrible things. It‚Äôs awful and I hope those struggling see through their insecurities."
BPD,epzu3dy,t1_epxhu29,1559672673.0,It changes for me all the time too! I used to be mainly introverted because I was so used to being home all day and had little to no friends. I‚Äôd say now I have a much larger group of friends but I still like staying home. Going out drains me but i also crave socialization. It definitely depending on the situation.
BPD,epx4o6x,t3_bwa19i,1559591938.0,I read a book called Quiet that explains the key difference between extroverts and introverts. This being how we use our energy. Do social interactions make us buzz or drain us? If you feel buzzed when you socialize then you‚Äôre an extrovert. You‚Äôre someone that requires social interactions to feel full. Do you feel drained after a social interaction? If social interactions drain your energy you‚Äôre an introvert. So it‚Äôs possible to be in the middle or to be a bit of both.
BPD,epx268u,t1_epv2691,1559590264.0,sometimes i wake up and think ‚Äúfuck it I should just block her on everything and leave‚Äù but I‚Äôm learning not to split and think things through. people will walk in and out of your life naturally without having to try. if this person is meant to be in your life it should come naturally.
BPD,epv1z1t,t3_bw0c3k,1559522134.0,A lot of personality disorders tend to blend. Think of it as a ven diagram and BPD having overlaps. My anxiety expresses itself as OCD so when I‚Äôm hyper-vigilant my ticks and checks go from mild to severe and I become paranoid and start stalking my friends on social media to make sure they aren‚Äôt doing things without me. If they are then my whole mood shifts and it ruins my day.
BPD,epv022g,t3_bw2ivu,1559520669.0,wow are you me? this last month I‚Äôve had my bff (who‚Äôs my FP) muted on socials as she goes out and travels without me. she too switched a flip on me but she actually initiated that I give her space so I did. I‚Äôve given her space and let her do her own thing last month and she‚Äôs not getting better. now she doesn‚Äôt wanna live together anymore so whether it was me or not I can‚Äôt really change that. sometimes you‚Äôve just gotta let them go for a while.
BPD,epsin72,t1_eps5yny,1559450368.0,"this is it. this is me. it‚Äôs never seen or triggered until a deeper level of relationship is established.  if we‚Äôre just good friends on the surface I‚Äôm stable,  but anything beyond that is difficult."
BPD,ep2atwc,t3_btrwka,1559005355.0,Making good or bad choices is a human concept. that doesn‚Äôt make you sick or evil. We all make good and bad choices. You are a decent person regardless of your choices. Don‚Äôt let anyone make you feel like less of a person because of a diagnosis.
EDM,eotkz8w,t1_eot1qwe,1558843104.0,That‚Äôs so funny because I feel the opposite. I can‚Äôt get into his albums much. His sets are great though. I think he should experiment a little though. He dropped some psyctrance at EDC and that took me for a turn lol.
BorderlinePDisorder,eoqztjx,t3_bsr0pd,1558799034.0,after an episode one night I slept for I think 12 hours uninterrupted. yeah those are the worst. not all episodes make me tired like that but the ones that keep me up late do.
