OCD,fgqmob2,t1_fgqmlan,1581027138.0,Yep! She’s getting me off the Lexapro first. I’m also pretty sensitive to meds and I’m glad she’s trying to avoid me feeling too medicated.
OCD,fgqj0n4,t1_fgqdeza,1581025125.0,Thank you! My psych wanted to start me low because I’m weening off Lexapro and I’m on Ativan too. But I see her again in two weeks so I’ll ask about adjusting in the future! Glad you’re feeling good!

InsightfulQuestions,f46qi3v,t3_djm0t9,1571412177.0,"I’ve lived with mental illness since I was a kid. One of the scariest symptoms is the panic attacks. The first thing I want to say is that you’re already being the best support system you can be by reaching out and trying to find additional help for her. It’s so important to recognize when we can’t provide everything or exactly what our struggling loved one needs: you’re not a professional, so never worry about getting it “right...” the best you can do is just to be there, let her vent, and validate her feelings (if her symptoms are like mine, she doesn’t really mean to target you, remember that anger and lashing out are signs of anxiety, and she just wants the fear to stop). Second, almost every major city or large town has access to mental health services without having to go through DHS/be hospitalized— I would stress for her NOT to go through that, as the goal of hospitalization is just to keep you temporarily stabilized, and she wants and needs more long-term help. A lot of these organizations will help if you don’t have insurance or need to find a payment plan that works for you; some are even free! Third, I would suggest that, with a care team’s help, your girlfriend considers going on medication. If she has a panic disorder, there’s only so far coping tools can go. Remind her that this is an illness like any other, and the right medicine will help her to feel so much calmer and like herself. Finally, remind her that she’s doing the right thing by recognizing her own limits and that she needs to do things in her own timing. Anxiety is different for everyone, and she needs to find the healthiest way for her to live with it. 

If I can help in any other way, please feel free to reach out! :)"
