BPD,fq2gugx,t1_fq1675a,1589056010.0,"I’ve noticed this as well... a lot of the “DAE” I have seen have been basic bpd traits/symptoms that obviously people with BPD would have. So I am left baffled when they “DAE” and follow it with a typical BPD trait...
I wonder how many people in this sub are ACTUALLY diagnosed"

I feel like it didn’t have that much of an effect on me; however, at times I found myself wishing I had a flatter stomach. I’m not chubby or fat. I’m on the “thick” to “slim thick” side, but my tummy isn’t flat like the contestants. It never got to the point where I was EXTREMELY critical of my body, though. I do plan on working out more often now. So, in a way LI has also motivated me!!
I liked seeing contestants like Alexandra from S4. She had a nice naturally curvy body. Also, Shaugnha for her thicker thighs/legs!"
