That being said, I don't think your psychiatrist is giving up on you. They aren't sure what more they can do for you, and don't want to pretend to, because if they are wrong they can cause you harm. Their opinion/view(whatever you want to call it), is that they can't give you much help at this point from them self, and they think you should go see someone that has more resources than them (even if it is inpatient). They aren't giving up on you, they are looking out for you. Good luck my friend."
