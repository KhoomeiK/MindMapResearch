NativeAmerican,fjsnldw,t3_feunrt,1583598871.0,"As much as I despise folks that claim ancestry with no foundation to back it up, I still think back to something my professor (Eastern Band Cherokee) said during their class. Basically, for centuries the governments of colonial nations have tirelessly worked to murder, assimilate, or erase our ancestors and communities. Due to the constant assault on Indigenous peoples, there are more than likely people with Indigenous ancestry that either don’t know or only have vague stories about where they come from. 

This doesn’t excuse someone outright lying about their ancestry for the rights that our peoples struggled to secure. But it does make me wonder if I’m not getting the full story when someone makes a claim like the typical great grandmother one. Just something to think about I suppose...."

It is nice to know that I am not a special case, and that there could be an actual term to go along with what I’ve been feeling for years. I just spent 15 or so minutes staring at my cubicle wall with a constant “what the hell am I doing?” screaming in my head. 

My team members and other people I work with say great things about my work and the connections I’ve made but their praises just hit a brick wall. It could be nice to look into what you’ve said so thanks again."
NativeAmerican,er5m9aj,t3_byon2c,1560528934.0,"I feel that your roommate hasn’t had many interactions with Indigenous folk. From my personal beliefs and experience with members of other nations, there’s nothing wrong with asking where someone comes from. The only problem I have is that I like to go through my people and family history a little too much. But I do like to answer questions to the best of my ability since there are so many misconceptions out there about Indigenous cultures, Indian law, and Indigenous issues."
NativeAmerican,er5lfd0,t3_bz5op4,1560528438.0,Much of Indigenous cultures are based on the respect and appreciation we give towards the earth and its inhabitants. From your post you seem to have a respectful way about you so I personally wouldn’t have anything bad to say. I’d only ask where you got it because it looks pretty neat!
