bipolar,fr60rnh,t3_gmu3wq,1589917898.0,I try not to react immediately when I get that way.  It sucks when we can't trust our perspective. I hope you feel better soon.
bipolar,fortefi,t3_g8rr7n,1588018187.0,I get this. I hate when I can't just stfu! I can't tell you how many nights I Iay awake and feel embarrassment from every stupid thing I've ever said. It makes me avoid people as much as possible. I never know what might come out of my mouth. Oh and that distant look people get when they just can't listen anymore... it sucks. Yet I still can't shut up.
bipolarart,focsf4f,t3_g6ta67,1587675231.0,I love all of them
relationships,fo4ibwd,t3_g5f5e0,1587504945.0,"Leave, please. It will never go back to how it was. It just won't. Get out and have no contact. It will be hard but it will be the best thing you can do for yourself. This is not how a relationship is supposed to be. 

I'm bipolar too. You'll never find stability in this situation. You have to get out and stop all contact."
relationships,fnk85t5,t3_g21ik6,1587017919.0,"This is truly heartbreaking. It was very difficult to read. I'm so sorry for your loss and for your parents being shit people. I'd say the best thing you can do is start a plan to move out and distance yourself from them. It may take time, but if you take it step by step, you'll get there. You should have more time to grieve and I'm sorry that you don't. Getting a job might be the best thing for you... it'll get you away from those toxic people. My heart goes out to you. ‚ù§"
BreakUps,fm3ccwj,t1_fm3c501,1585718895.0,"Life doesn't care about what we deserve, unfortunately. Bad things are gonna happen sometimes but that doesn't mean you did something to deserve it. 

Take time to care for yourself. A long shower. Whatever your beauty routine is. Take care of yourself. It's the best way to get through this. 

Get some sunlight if you can."
BreakUps,fm3bol6,t3_fssqfx,1585718312.0,It will get better. Just take care of yourself.
Minecraft,fm3allx,t3_fso6iv,1585717396.0,When do you think it will be finished?
bipolar,fk5ylwh,t3_fgn55n,1583890297.0,You're not a loser. Go easy on yourself. Bipolar is incredibly difficult.
bipolar,fh4nsrl,t1_fh4mdvt,1581280406.0,I'm happy to know it helped with your depression. I'm also on 300mg. Hopefully I'll feel better soon. Thanks for your response.
bipolar,fh4n8e1,t3_f1eci8,1581280316.0,"I find art to be a wonderful outlet, as well as something to sort of reign in my brain. It started as therapy for me and is now my career. 

Have you ever tried to paint? It's so fun and what's the worst that can happen? YouTube has a bunch of tutorials, as well. 

I like to listen to music, get out a fresh canvas and some paint and just see what happens. I pour everything I'm feeling into it. Sometimes it allows me to communicate things inside that I can't express verbally.  You don't have to be good at it to get the benefits. 

As far as why, for me, it was a suggestion from my therapist and I fell in love with creating. I think most people who feel things so deeply have to find some sort of outlet and perhaps that's the link. I wonder if there's any research out there on this."
bipolar,fh4ghct,t1_fh4b71f,1581278416.0,Thank you for understanding. It's nice not to feel quite so alone in this.
bipolar,fh48zwe,t1_fh41kel,1581276390.0,Thank you for your response. I vaguely remember my doctor telling me he was gonna add another medication as soon as I've adjusted to this one. I think he's trying to get the mania under control.
bipolar,fh48b69,t1_fh470dx,1581276287.0,"Okay, thank you for the advice. I'll definitely let him know how I'm feeling. I have an appointment in 2 weeks.  Hopefully I'll feel better by then."
bipolar,fh44pbu,t1_fh43alj,1581275166.0,"Thank you for your response. I will google ACT. Thanks for the reminder to try to keep my mind in the present. It's so difficult not to think in terms of good and bad, but I understand what you are saying. I panicked at how drugged I feel. I'm trying to remind myself that the first few days are the hardest."
relationships,fgm9sja,t1_fgm8v4j,1580920565.0,"Ultimately, it's up to you. Trust your gut. I think if I accidentally crossed someone's boundaries, I'd be apologetic and use extreme caution in my actions following the incident. I wouldn't get angry and speed off. His actions showed a complete lack of respect. Just my opinion."
relationships,fglzz42,t3_ez82bd,1580915035.0,"I'm seeing serious red flags here. You're gonna have to tell him not to contact you again. That way, if he begins to harass you (often stories like this end that way and worse), you have what you need if you have to go to the police. 

Not respecting boundaries is a serious red flag. Getting extremely angry upon being called out is another. 

In the words of Karen and Georgia from MFM ""F*ck politeness."" He did wrong and you owe him nothing."
AncestryDNA,fgfz8dx,t3_ey8s5y,1580750822.0,"I called after 2 weeks and they told me the samples are sent to Utah first, then to Ireland for processing. It isn't marked as received until it leaves the Utah facility to be shipped to Ireland."
