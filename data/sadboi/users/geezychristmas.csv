I have been looking for a dupe for protini for a while. 
I’ve heard the d’Alba Piedmont Peptide No-Sebum Repair Cream ($45 for 1.69 oz in the U.S.) is similar, but with a different consistency.  I haven’t tried it, but it’s supposed to be a decent dupe. 
I have actually tried the Acure Radically rejuvenating whipped night cream($17 for 1.7 oz @ Target). It has peptides and vitamin C. It has a much thicker consistency. I don’t think it’s a great dupe, but it is cheaper and a pretty good night cream. I definitely got better results from protini though."

loseit,euh9x5j,t3_cgc68a,1563823516.0,I also love Lizzo. Her music is so unique and uplifting. Check out coconut oil. It’s like a  healing balm for the soul. She has a lot of great music.

Although I don’t think this person handled the situation well, I do think that depression can be really hard for the people around us. I had undiagnosed depression while with a long-term partner and I know it affected him so much. We ended up breaking up.  It’s been a while and I’ve gotten better but I really regret how much I put on him because of my depression."

But as far as food goes I like quest protein bars. I think they usually have 14 to 15 g per bar. Beans and raw vegetables like carrots and celery are also my go to. Apples will also help."
