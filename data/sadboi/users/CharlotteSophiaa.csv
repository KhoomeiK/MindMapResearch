Hope that helps! Maybe give it a few days before going in again!"
depression,ewoxetf,t3_cp1ajy,1565628826.0,All the time. I actually sit and convince myself that it won't be worth the heartache to go out and do something because nobody will want to be with me anyway.

SkyGame,ewf3od3,t1_ewdwtvu,1565349933.0,I absolutely agree with this! I also think there should be more ways to get hearts! Hopefully they add some challenges or something where players can gain them like they do with the seasonal tasks!

I'll also be honest, I was gutted when I found out there wasn't a hidden Spirit etc after waiting for 7 other players to pray with me!"
SkyChildrenOfLight,ew5rq1b,t3_clb7lo,1565143441.0,"Think it's reference to ""That Game Company"" other game they made ""Flower"". Think it's a little Easter Egg but I could be wrong. Would be cool if something did happen though!"
