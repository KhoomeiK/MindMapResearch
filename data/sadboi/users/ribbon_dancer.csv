EarthPorn,fph9262,t3_gdd0tz,1588617106.0,Why does a part of me wish that I could currently live here?
AskWomen,fph8fpc,t3_gd0rwi,1588616796.0,"This is a good question. Ask yourself: Is this person truly open to evolving as a human being  
And, are they actively working on their inner environment to cultivate a healthy relationship with themselves?   
Or, are they dead-set on staying the way they are?   
Which version of this are they showing you by their CONSISTENT \*actions\*, AND NOT JUST THEIR WORDS? <- This is very important.

It's not enough to use ""Oh, they don't abuse me physically/emotionally, they aren't mean to me, they are there for me when I really need, they have good hygiene, they are affectionate etc, so therefore they're what I want/need""... these are basic actions of human decency.   
The bar shouldn't be set so low that these basic actions of human decency are the baseline for an intimate relationship. 

For me it's asking, what are their flaws? And if it's something a little more serious than the fact that they chew weird or the like, such as.... ex: 'I feel condescended by their tone when they speak to me whenever they get angry at me', Are you able to voice your feelings?   
And when they are voiced, are they heard and then a different action implemented?   
If it isn't implemented after communicating clearly, then that's when denial can set in or compromising of boundaries. Then that creates resentment.   


Also, getting crystal clear on what and how you desire to feel within an intimate relationship with another. How you want your partner to operate and how willing you are to operate in reciprocity.  
Write all of that shit down. And be VERY specific! 

I can't stress enough how much this helps."
AskWomen,fph6h7h,t3_gd0rwi,1588615812.0,"Not sure if this helps but my therapist gave me this motherly advice once:

If you aren't happy with your partner exactly as they are in this present day and time, then there is a big possibility you will likely not be happy with them years from now."

relationship_advice,fm3l4ac,t1_fm2swv7,1585727395.0,"This is a rather linear way to view a long term monogamous relationship, imo. Typically, and from my observations, when people who are in ltrs express that they'd like to open their relationship, what is really needed is the willingness to:

1.) express their desires and have them be listened to.  
and  
2.) to be able to talk openly about why they feel this way. What is actually needed is to discuss on a deeper level what is going on that is causing them to feel the need to go outside of said relationship for satisfaction- emotionally, physically, etc.

Then, when the reasons that spouse is feeling that way are discussed, they can hopefully move forward with information that helps their relationship progress in a way that doesn't betray either spouse's wants and needs. My belief personally is that you can still be satisfied within a monogamous relationship after expressing the desire for openness, but it takes great deal of of emotional maturity and a willingness to work toward healthy communication on both parts."
relationship_advice,fm3kn96,t1_fm3iipv,1585726897.0,"This is the thing. Men tend to get so in their ego-mind that they don't actually understand what a woman is trying to say. And, for women in particular, it's important to be mentally open and stimulated in order to have really great; mind-blowing orgasms. I'm glad you two are speaking about this so honestly and openly.

Also, I agree with someone way up yonder, sometimes the fantasy can be better than the reality. However, it seems like you both received a lot of lessons in communication about this so I'd consider that a big win."
relationship_advice,fm3jr7d,t1_fm28a7s,1585725969.0,"That's amazing that you're so insightful as to realize this. What an important perspective to have. Communication- HEALTHY communication- goes a lonnnnng way. Especially when both parties are willing to listen, hear each other out, and actively work on whatever issues arise and not run away from them when all is said and done. Both people must be willing to do the hard work. Best wishes to you."
AskWomen,fm3iu9u,t3_fsdyhu,1585725033.0,"Having a similar lifestyle is important in a relationship, but it doesn't necessarily have to be everything. For me though, having a spouse who cares about his body and health is much more attractive than someone who eats unhealthily and couldn't give two flying funyuns about their appearance. More than that, I believe that when someone loves you, they want to be present for you- emotionally and physically. Therefore, taking good care of their health, internally and externally, is paramount.

To me, taking care of oneself says, ""I love you. And, I want to be around on this planet for you, for our future kids and for as long as I possibly can.""

I've witnessed and experienced before the affects of what not really caring about one's body/fitness and health can do to negatively impact a relationship, and that's not something I want to go through or witness anymore. Yes, I accept my spouse as they are wholly and completely. This is important. It isn't as much about the looks though as it is about the health aspect.

At the same time though, it makes logical sense to me that-  
When you deeply love yourself and you deeply love your spouse, then taking care of your body is a beautiful act of love and commitment. 

It says, ""I'm in this for the long-haul, I want to be strong and beautiful because I love myself and I love you. And, because I love my past/present/future self and because I love you,   
I vow to take good care of myself because I don't plan on going anywhere."""

I'm a healthy mix of secure/ avoidant-anxious according to the test, and this is how I feel within my current relationship.

It's interesting how I can become triggered by something he does or doesn't do, then realize it's actually activating something within me regarding my partner/last relationship. It reminds me of one of the huge reasons my last relationship blew up in my face... that partner brought baggage from his past relationships into ours and it absolutely contributed in destroying what we had built for 3 years shy of a decade.

I'm continuing to work on myself so that I don't carry that toxicity from the past into whatever this current relationship I am in is meant to be.

Luckily, he is open and actively reading Attached with me so that we can discuss any bs that may arise. It's definitely a learning experience, for sure."

I understand. We broke up last year and he started seeing the new chick before we even broke up. He threw himself into his new relationship without actually facing his pain for more than two seconds. I'd feel bad for her if she didn't seem like a desperate human being who actively went after somebody who she knew was vulnerable. (Red flag much?)

Since I chose to face my pain like a mf boss, I'm now able to be involved with a man isn't flaunting our relationship in a childish way, who is 100% communicative, who doesn't get jealous, who works on his relationship issues so he can be the best he can be, who doesn't bitch about my family but wants to get to know them better (and takes initiative to do so. my family can be a daunting bunch, if one allows that perspective to intimidate them) and who wants to evolve with me and doesn't just talk the talk but shows me, and most importantly himself, by his actions that he is who he says he is.

That right there is proof that you will find somebody who is emotionally mature enough to face themselves and the hard stuff when the going gets tough. It's out there. This relationship ending is making space for the person who will stay beside you and do the work no matter what."

Being younger, she hasn't had as much life experience as you yet so I feel like you need to cut this situation some slack. Get to know her more and allow her to get to know you more. Sex can still be important and come at a later time in a relationship. No one relationship is the same so it's about communicating between the two of you where each of you are at. And, if she's simply not yet ready, then she's not yet ready. You either respect that and figure out how to make things work or you move on to someone who wants immediate sex. She's never had sex before this point so obviously it is a big deal to her. I think if you try to get closer to her with sex being the goal in mind then it's just gonna create this weird energy between you both. What are you really after with sex? Is it intimacy? Cumming? Closeness? The physical act? All of it? This could be an interesting opportunity for you to get to know your own self through practicing patience- why do you feel the need to have sex quickly within a relationship? what is it about that you are having a difficult time waiting longer than you're used to?

That means a lot for you to say, thank you. The way it's appearing is that it's either a rebound or/and the 7 years together was a big long lie. It was a very long time and is a strange adjust, especially considering the reaction of the end result from both of us after all was said and done. It's unfortunate and shitty to say the least. I'd like to say it ended with love and respect but it ended with betrayal, heartbreak, and immaturity. And no, I haven't met this chick and don't plan on it.

ExNoContact,f7o9gs4,t1_f4z95f0,1573923487.0,"I get that. And I agree, the entertainment industry sure as hell doesn’t help the matter.

Everybody starts from square one though. Nine times out of ten, a person isn’t showed a 100% healthy way to love growing up. Therefore, it’s their job to learn how to love in a supportive and healthy way. It’s whether or not they choose that task with valiant effort and dedication."
BreakUps,f7n8xxl,t1_f7mv7w3,1573889875.0,Gosh this is refreshing. And inspiring. I really hope this is me three years from now.
BreakUps,f7n8wgv,t3_dx0sn0,1573889812.0,A-fucking-men. Yes yes and YES.
BreakUps,f7n8w6i,t1_f7mwgw2,1573889799.0,Couldn't agree more with you.
ExNoContact,f7gom20,t1_f7gmds8,1573710733.0,"From the bottom of my heart, I'm so incredibly sorry. I understand the grief from death very well- my mama passed away 3 years ago now. It's absurd and unfair that me and you are being forced to go through two different kinds of grief back to back, and even more fucked up that yours is happening within the same year... my goodness.
It sounds like your ex overlapped as well, which adds even more shittiness to an already shitty experience. Unfortunately, I understand quite a bit of that too. 
It's all just very shitty.
My heart goes out to you."
ExNoContact,f7gny8e,t1_f7geyyp,1573710026.0,It sucks.
ExNoContact,f7dchxi,t3_dv8ur7,1573613176.0,🙄 I wish I could upvote this a thousand times.
GilmoreGirls,f7agvy1,t3_duv9d2,1573528972.0,"Even though I liked Zack and he was funny, I agree. He was pretty lazy and lacked ambition. He was better toward her after they got engaged though."
BreakUps,f7afigx,t3_duzgj6,1573527952.0,Agreed.
ExNoContact,f7afh9v,t3_dv1buy,1573527929.0,"Thanks, Jim Halpert.."
relationship_advice,f71uebb,t3_dtynnb,1573348381.0,"I am so sorry that happened to you. I can only imagine how violated and hurt you must feel. This type of behavior is not okay and isn't just a huge red flag but a loud alarm signaling that something is way off here. You did not consent to this. Just because you're in a relationship doesn't give the person you're with the right to your body. It is \*your\* body, therefore you have sole autonomy over what is a yes and a no for you. You stated your no yet he continued, (three times!) to do what he wanted to do to you sexually. It sounds to me like this was a glaring no, yet your boyfriend chose to be selfish and do what he wanted, and the fact that this happened after you had been drinking makes me uncomfortable. 

If I were you, I'd let him know that this is unacceptable behavior, that he absolutely 100% violated you, and then I'd honestly break up with him. This act was blatant disrespect in what should be a safe, loving, communicative part of your relationship.

Please do not take blame, shame or fault for this. You did nothing wrong here. This situation is not on you whatsoever. This was not your fault, OP."
BreakUps,f71t6ro,t1_f6yk09w,1573347616.0,"Oh, that is incredibly kind of you. Thank you. Truly."
BreakUps,f6ye6l6,t1_f6x9hi0,1573276424.0,">Everything you need to know about breakups.

I know this wasn't geared toward me but I really needed to hear some of these words today. Thank you for sharing."
BreakUps,f6ydymx,t1_f6wiru2,1573276182.0,Yikes. I definitely needed this truth reminder today.
