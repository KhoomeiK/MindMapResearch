Drugs,fn80em3,t1_fn7yx4z,1586731302.0,"You're right with it being twice as strong as codeine, hence why I take no more than 400mg as any more is a waste as your body can't process it into morphine after so much, funny how drugs work. I took 11 tablets of 30mg of dihydrocodeine one after the other with an empty stomach as I always ensure it is so it kicks in a lot faster and more strongly. I always time my doses and make sure to stay up for a couple of hours to prevent any chances of going to sleep and that occurring as well as throwing up beforehand to get rid of any that remains, it's one heck of a cycle!"
Drugs,fn7y2eg,t1_fn7wa37,1586729940.0,"I don't even have a tolerance, every time I use dihydrocodiene or codeine I usually take upto 300-400mg in one pop to get the most out of it however I don't usually mix it with alcohol as I know it can become a problem however stupidly made the decision. I typically get them every 2-3 times a month with each dose being that amount and taking each one within a minute after one another."

You'll never experience the same buzz you had when you first came across Lyrica, as i'm sure everyone will agree. I got into a bad habit and began from 900mg a day towards nearly 3000mg a day within a couple of weeks, not only can it become dangerous but your body will act against it's favour and tolerance becomes a problem with every single night of constant use.

Drugs,fgnx5in,t1_fgnw53f,1580954832.0,Thank you for the detailed response and I take them on few occasions as I typically use large doses of codeine phosphate (not co-codamol) but I don't think I realised the amount until I worked it out and it's certainly a lot more than I typically take due to it's ceiling effect - if I notice that something is wrong and off then I'll do exactly that. Thanks again.
gabagoodness,fgnsvw2,t1_fgn11pu,1580952179.0,"Yeah, certainly don't want to get into larger doses (i'll be taking a much lower dose on my next session) as with the fair amount I've got, I don't want to make it a habit of it as it's very much addictive/habit forming. I typically only use it for anxiety and it works a treat and of course as another treat I take it recreationally on a few occasions - stuff is great! Thanks for the feedback mate!"

codeine,fbi3a6w,t3_edi0ax,1576889550.0,"I believe it's either every 6/12 months  - one of those. Although, they usually tell you after you make your purchase, worse that could happen is that they just simply stop giving it you completely so give it time. They seem to be cracking down on it hard now since it's become too much of a trend and gained too much attention. 

All the best."
lean,fbi2sz7,t1_fbi2opn,1576889163.0,Ps. if you need any further information and have any other questions feel free to ask me either here or privately.
lean,fbi2opn,t1_fbfjrz0,1576889068.0,"Personally, I prefer a mixture of both since they both affect you differently despite being very related. I don't use  Diphenhydramine/promethazine as they are mostly used to combat the nausea and histamine release from codeine phosphate (codeine phosphate is lethal for causing intense itching all over for a long period of time) therefore if you were to take codeine phosphate in a high dose then you'd definitely be best with the antihistamines you listed as they combat the few nasty side effects that come with codeine phosphate, leaving you with the feeling you desire.  I'm a huge fan of dihydrocodeine as it's not only twice as strong but also more intense both physically and mentally and not to mention it doesn't really require any antihistamines since it barely causes much of a histamine release, although you can add it alongside to potentiate it further. Hope this info helps - Merry Christmas."
codeine,faweobe,t1_farf7gr,1576370019.0,"Hi, sorry for the late response, personally i'd go for a dose of around 100-200mg."

codeine,fap2w1i,t3_ea9muv,1576278516.0,"If it's your first time using codeine phosphate, I'd recommend a dose between 150-200mg, bare in mind that codeine phosphate causes a huge histamine rush so it causes a lot of itchiness and a little nausea which can sometimes be really uncomfortable so if you have any first generation antihistamines lying around such as promethazine then take that beforehand - it works a treat and as a bonus it also enhances/potentiates the high massively. Enjoy and stay safe matey!"
Dihydrocodeine,fap0mqu,t1_faokoou,1576276953.0,"Recreationally. Tonight I've decided to go for 400mg of dihydrocodeine, 200mg codeine phosphate, 10mg of diazepam and just now I've decided to add 600mg of pregablin to potentiate it further. To be frank, I'm a little disappointed as I took it on an empty stomach (I don't eat anything all day when i'm having a session to ensure an empty stomach) and it just doesn't feel as strong as it has been in the past but oh well!"

lean,faeu54p,t3_e81y9y,1576008231.0,"Definitely more euphoric as it's stronger than codeine. From experience, the high feels a lot more cleaner, less itchiness (I don't even need to use antihistamines even at really high doses) and you generally feel in complete bliss. If you've never experienced it before, i'd say a dose around 100-150mg is fitting although i'd recommend using the following link for a more accurate recommended dosage range:  [http://drugs.tripsit.me/Dihydrocodeine](http://drugs.tripsit.me/Dihydrocodeine)"

I chose to get the Rayban new wayfarers however with them being clear prescription glasses they appear much larger with them looking daft size wise - I can vaguely remember being told they were larger than the ones advertised as sunglasses as they are clear prescription lenses however was only told this when given the glasses and so a refund wasn't an option. Cutting it short, I think I'll pay for them to be made prescription sunglasses since they deserve to be shown off for the price.
