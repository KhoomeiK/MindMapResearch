from law of one:

[20](https://www.lawofone.info/s/20).[20](https://www.lawofone.info/s/20#20) **Questioner:** Thank you. What percentage of the entities, roughly, were— who were in third density here at that time were Martian and what percentage were harvested out of Earth’s second density?

**Ra:** I am Ra. There were perhaps one-half of the third-density population being entities from the Red Planet, Mars, as you call it. Perhaps one-quarter from second density of your planetary sphere. Approximately one-quarter from other sources, other planetary spheres whose entities chose this planetary sphere for third-density work.

[20](https://www.lawofone.info/s/20).[21](https://www.lawofone.info/s/20#21) **Questioner:** When they incarnated here did they mix— did all three of these types mix together in societies or groups or were they separated by group or society?

**Ra:** I am Ra. They remained largely unmixed.

[20](https://www.lawofone.info/s/20).[22](https://www.lawofone.info/s/20#22) **Questioner:** Then did this unmixing lend to a possibility of separation of group, then, or the possibility of warlike attitude between groups?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is correct.

tumblr,fp70ls2,t1_fp6w9ad,1588361882.0,"I never said or implied others had to disprove my claims. Saying something is ""straight up wrong"" is wanting for explanation and is barely a contribution to a conversation. If you don't want to talk about it (or can't support your claims), just say you don't want to talk about (nothing wrong with not knowing).

Individual experience is the most worthwhile source available to one person. Media, the psychiatry industry, tumblr mental illness trends (especially this), studies funded by biased organizations, these things need to be analyzed and not accepted as true just because the source seems reputable. Or because a large group of people agrees with it. Think for yourself. The real answers come from experience, meditation, observation of yourself and others, conversation with people who have experienced both things in common with you and different from you.

I realize saying something is ""spiritual"" has negative connotation to those who haven't experienced anything that could be described as spiritual (yet). The fact is, spirituality is closely related with mental illness (and everything else) and it's dismissed in psychiatry (and many other areas) to prevent people from owning their power. If you're not ready for that, go ahead and dismiss this and move along with your life. It's okay."

 Here's where I'm coming from if you are interested. Skip over if you don't care (literally up to you)

From my experience, mental illnesses are the result of societal stress and oppression, causing people to develop beliefs that they are helpless and there is something wrong with them. This turns into a self fulfilling prophecy. It goes deeper, many people with mental illnesses are more connected to the collective unconscious and are sometimes more empathic than most people. With my schizoaffective disorder, I have had numerous unexplainable experiences that seemed to be spiritual in nature. In my life I have seen how when a person changes their beliefs, it changes what aspects of reality are attracted to them. I think there's more to mental illness that a cold, scientific, consensus reality based viewpoint can possibly explain.

Cancer is the result of exposure to harmful chemicals and radiation, causing cells to mutate. I don't believe they are the same. I don't think they should be viewed in a similar way at all. 

But that's just from my experience. Why do you believe that cancer is an analogy to mental illness (believe me i'm not trying to come off as demeaning or anything I'm just curious)?"

For the holobreathing i usually take a shower and stretch and drink a lot of water before i do it. I also clean my room/ the space i'm doing it in and light a candle so it smells good. It helps me feel mentally clean and focused. 

honestly kratom and lsd helped to trigger my psychosis, but if it works for you it works for you

weird thing about energy is when you start forcing yourself to do something it gets easier and easier to keep on doing more things. 

i feel you with being alone, i don't have close friends rn but i feel like if i exist there has to be like minded people out there who will understand me, and i'm confident i'll find them even if its not anytime soon. it gets rough though

hope all goes well for you, i feel like theres a ton of things out there you can try before resorting to medication. neville goddard /loa can be a little weird to get in to but it works for some reason if you keep at it"
Psychosis,fnkf0cj,t3_g29hb2,1587024580.0,"Hi. i've got similar diagnoses and have had similar issues. I've been to the psych ward for psychosis several times. I don't currently take any medication, haven't in a long time. Sure, I struggle sometimes, but am generally doing really well. Here's a few things that keep me in check:

1. breathing exercises, like holotropic breath work (for a short time 20-40 min) can help you feel more stable and more connected with yourself. it might help if you've got that high energy never ending train of thoughts that happens to a lot of people
2. Getting into law of attraction. check out r/nevillegoddard . it's a sub about the ideas of a spiritual teacher based around creating your own reality.  I really like his point of view and ""law of attraction""-type ideas have changed my life for the better. for real. give it a try if you want. find what works for you. open-mindedness won't hurt 
3. finding flow experiences, things that you can lose yourself in and you don't notice the passage of time. like music, art, skateboarding, reading, gardening, building/ making something. anything you just naturally feel passionate about. also it's good to stay away from consuming things like tv, social media etc and focus more on creating
4. more on number 3 and creating things so you feel more accomplished. like with the ADD mind, just find a little thing you can make as a result of your brief research sessions. like what if, after researching something, you wrote a little short story, poem, sketched something, saved some photos of the things you researched and made a collage. doing this might help you feel like you have accomplishments you can proudly look back on. also theres nothing wrong with getting into researching something for just a short amount of time at all.
5. get a blood test and see if you have any deficiencies. for example a vitamin d deficiency can cause a lot of fatigue and taking a vitamin for it can help a lot. for concentration you can take gingko and omega 3s they improve brain circulation. try to eat healthy too, it really makes a difference.

sorry i really went off on here, i wanted to give you lots of ideas. hope you find something that helps you. also it's ok to be a hermit and not be very social for a while if it allows you to feel comfortable, real progress is made when people feel safe"

lawofattraction,fmxdf9a,t1_fmvom9b,1586462916.0," I think I posted this in the wrong sub. My motivation for this idea was based more on neville goddard's teachings (which I saw is in your list of teachers)-> your own consciousness is God, or what you call source, and you can change yourself by changing your beliefs about yourself. He also teaches that you can alter the world around you with your beliefs. Not specific thoughts, but beliefs.  Essentially, if I believe this audio track that I created will work for me, it will (it already has). My spiritual experiences have led me to believe that what Neville says is true.

I should have clarified that my track **isn't subliminal**.  I just wanted background music to help me sleep. Everything I'm saying in the track is audible. Listening to it while awake just before sleeping has gotten me to a higher vibrational state where once I hear the affirmations, I can immediately visualize them in my head. While sleeping my dreams have become more vivid. 

As for the science, I'm not too worried about it. What works for me works for me (not using subliminals anyway.) **When creating my own reality I've found it to be most effective to make my own methods based on my experiences and experimentation, and not concern myself with what others believe about their reality.**

Personally as someone who has been diagnosed schizoaffective, I think it's a matter of making her aware that certain things are delusions instead of trying to convince her to believe she has a disorder. No one wants to be thought of as just a label. And let's face it, it is just a label to describe common experiences between people. Don't focus on the label.  **Treat her like the individual that she is**. She may be more open to thinking of herself as a person who experiences some things that are out of the ordinary and can believe things that are untrue rather than someone whose entire mental world and behaviors can be defined by one word.

Keep it all centered around her individual experience. Suggest that going to therapy can help her work through specific beliefs that harm her.
