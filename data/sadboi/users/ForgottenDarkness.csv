Coronavirus,fk2fml3,t3_fg1gcp,1583799983.0,"Makes you wonder just how bad it is and where. Asia us screwed up but personally I’m not worried. Maybe over time it’ll truly be something but at the moment it’s tame. Its like something out of a movie. Hard to buy as a whole with usual fear mongering and all. Reminds me of the 80s’ satanic panic with how people supposedly are reacting or overreacting, just a bit."

SuicideWatch,fjzk5s4,t3_ffgb0q,1583721642.0,"I feel that way all the time often joking “probably be 5 people there and I’ll be forgotten a day or 2 later.” Course, my mom would be devastated but even when we think, swear and feel we’re worthless trash, there’s often someone who’d be devastated if we died we just don’t feel it let alone feel anything but pain and despair. I won’t put any religious crap as that’s insulting, but people will notice and feel bad even if they do not personally know you. We’ve all been there at one point or another. Even when you think nobody notices, you’d be surprised."
SuicideWatch,fjzj4b0,t3_ffcy1q,1583720947.0,"People often tune others out for unknown reasons, but we all have loads of issues some just hide theirs well. Other times, some do such things because they don’t understand or think it’s an act. Sadly, there are some like this who do it for attention or leverage in a relationship, so some keep their distance. But when it comes to suicide many do not understand it or don’t want any responsibility. People that just vanish aren’t worth  knowing anyway, but some may just not understand it. Most do not I’ve found, much like mental illness but it’s better than it was. Still, I can relate to much of what you are saying from my past. Most people suck but there are “real” people that know real pain. Hang in there (no pun intended), but vent over anything as we’ve likely been there already or currently."
SuicideWatch,fjzhf5z,t3_f612y6,1583719790.0,"I have a lot of experience in this area. You are severely depressed but you quite likely are going through something which triggered these feelings or may have a mental disorder. It’s sadly very easy to become overwhelmed and feel helpless in life, especially when few can relate or understand. Is this a problem there? Another thing is you’re only 17, the brain gets overwhelmed quite easy snd hormones dominate. Been there myself. I would try and reach out to someone there that may understand your plight that does not make you feel like a freak (assuming it does). There is no shame in admitting you’re in a rut or worse. It happens in life to many over and over. That being said, if you ever need to vent we’re not all frauds or wise asses that get off on stupid comments. Suicide is a normal feeling but if often passes. However, do seek help if it gets worse. Having been there many s time, I sadly know it all. But in the meantime grab ahold of anything that makes you feel something, whether music, movies, writing or your boyfriend. If you need to vent though, always good to let it out."
