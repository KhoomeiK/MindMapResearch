Wouldn't it be great if *other* politicians within the executive branch had the balls to do the same? Could you imagine if they would all fix their own mistakes?..and admit fault?? Take responsibility?? 

People make mistakes. This was a big one. But if you want to look at mistakes made by leaders, this one pales in comparison to what others have done and still enjoy unwavering support. 

Down vote if you don't like to face this truth. At least he didn't ignore the virus for a week so he could go on his precious golfing excursion that is paid for by tax dollars. 

Incidentally, a close friend of mine had her mother  pass away at Newfane last week. There were other homes with logistical strategies in place for COVID patients. But Newfane did not separate them at all and did not follow proper safety measures to contain the disease. The home has a past history of patient family grievances that indicate those 22+ deaths are the result of extremely poor nursing home care in general. The owners of the home are being investigated and will likely be sued. But the state and the governor won't likely be sued because of the success rates of containment in the other nursing homes. So it's  not all Andy's fault."

RRMS since 2009, in longterm remission (4 years).

What do you know about the cranial lymph system and how can we optimize its function to help us achieve a more permanent remission as opposed to what do we do (in this lymph system) that perhaps causes relapses?

Essentially, I am investigating what is the cranial lymph system's ultimate functions in people with MS? I know this system was just discovered a few years ago and there may not be much out there on it, but as it was a major discovery in neuroscience, I'm hoping that you have also studied it. 

I have a theory about how lymph health can either cause or prevent lesions as well as create ogliodendricytes to help repair myelin damage."
