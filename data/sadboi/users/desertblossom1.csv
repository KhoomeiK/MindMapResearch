bipolar,fqsn2ez,t1_fqrvz2d,1589612094.0,"Thank you, that’s helpful. I forget what it was like to be a kid, mostly due to repressing most of those memories. My issue I think is as I start to get better, I have no idea what that means or looks like. It terrifies me and I feel pressured to do everything I always wanted to do once I feel better. I don’t know what an average life is. I don’t know if that will ever be enough and that’s what terrifies me. I know society and media plays a big role in feeling this way, but I just don’t fit in anymore. It’s like everything is eclipsing me, and I’m barely figuring out how to adult again as I come up to my late twenties. Friends are planning on having kids, or even another. And I’m over here filling up a pill box, hoping one of them fixes me. It’s a messed up feeling. Thank you for reminding me of the simple things and I don’t owe anyone anything <3"
bipolar,fqsmir9,t1_fqslmwn,1589611610.0,"Yep. It’s unfortunate that stable is actually horribly boring. I’m assuming that is how most people function, but may not be as hyper aware of how boring it is? I feel like people suffering with mental illness struggle with filling a stable role because it takes away from our identity and what makes us different from the rest of the world. Our brains are beautiful chaos, which make it hard to exist functionally without critiquing every moment. I was tempted to ween off meds because the idea of normalcy and happiness absolutely terrifies me, because when I imagine what that looks like long term, it’s an empty room waiting to be filled, but I don’t have anything to fill it with."
bipolar,fqsm499,t1_fqrwnv9,1589611261.0,"I’ve literally been in school for 6 years on and off with no degree to show because I genuinely hate school with a passion. But I’ve never been able to find an entry level job that was exciting enough or paid enough for me to stay. Therefore I’m working minimum wage jobs at best. Nothing wrong with the service industry, but I think people forget about us. We are suffering, and deserve more recognition financially. Not everyone can just go to school and focus. I’m tired of being told that eventually I’ll find something, one day I’ll be successful. I’m 26 years old. I’m not 18 anymore. It’s a lot harder to just “find” something now. I totally understand what you’re getting at. My kindness and compassion isn’t what society wants. It would be great to hit goals, make money, and fit into society but I feel like I literally never will and will continue to live my life comparing and complaining. It’s a vicious cycle, of never even being able to climb a minimum wage ladder because I’m too depressed or can’t wake up early enough."

The Mandelic acid I only use on days I don’t use my Curology(1-2x a week)The small jar is the TreeActiv cystic acne treatment. The sunscreen I’m iffy on, not sure if it’s causing breakouts, I’ve used it for about 1 1/2 weeks now. It’s expensive so would like to continue before I buy a new sunscreen. 
I will be starting a NEW Curology formula suggested by this wonderful community! I’ll be on Tretinoin 0.01%, Clindamycin 1%, Azaleic Acid 4% 
I have hormonal acne that is destroying my confidence and adding to my depression. I am totally revamping my routine by changing product that has been raved about in this community.

My pain seems more controlled in the sense that I’m usually only in pain close to my period, during, and slightly after. My fatigue hits almost a week prior to a period and can even follow a week after. The only way I imagine why I’m always so fatigued is my body is constantly fighting my inflammation, and closer to my period, my body goes into over drive. I am constantly fatigued. I can’t even call it tired, otherwise I could take a nap and feel better. It’s the worst and not enough coffee in the world could ever fix it"

Backstory: I have had hormonal acne for years, birth control only helped occasionally but it still came back. I have endometriosis so sometimes my cystic acne can flare if I’m experiencing internal flares. I’m seriously so embarrassed over my skin. I feel hopeless. I’ve spent so much money trial and erroring products. I’m so frustrated. Please help me curate a new routine and recommended products. I’m at my wits end with this. All Klairs, the La Roche sunscreen moisturizer, and I’m from is NEW product, as in I got it a month ago. I believe the toner is breaking me out just a bit more, but regardless my skin hasn’t changed too much since I tried those products. The only things I removed from my routine prior was the Estée Lauder night repair serum and Mario Bedascu SPF oil free moisturizer . 

AM: La Roche Posay Gentle Cleanser, The Ordinary Buffet, Klairs supple toner(discontinuing this), I’m From Mugwort Essence (May discontinue), La Roche Posay SPF moisturizer(new in routine - possible breaks outs?) 

PM: Clinique take the day balm, same cleanser, the ordinary buffet, same toner, Clinique dramatically different moisturizer with inflammation pump, curology (niacinamide 4%, clindamycin 1%, zinc 0.25%)

Sometimes I cant decide which disorder I really have. My therapist has told me “the name of the disorder doesn’t matter, it’s the meds that work that matter.” The two disorders overlap so much, I’ve just accepted I must have both, which sucks, because I feel like I have a double dose of everything bad about ADHD/ADD and Bipolar. I was diagnosed with ADD as an adult, though my mom suspected I had it as a kid.. just never got me diagnosed. Ritalin has been amazing but sometimes hyper focus can turn into spurts of mania. ADHD and Bipolar is really confusing. I feel like I must be faking one or the other, but all my meds seem to be helpful, so I must just be a mental mess after all. :)"

This hasn’t made much of a difference for my skin, I can clear it up for a week or so, but my cystic acne always comes back with a vengeance. Acne is usually on my chin, cheeks, and more recently my neck? I have acne like this on both sides of my face. My skin feels textured and my makeup usually gets cakey, and my nose is very flakey and dry under makeup. I have never tried Korean skin care, but I’ve heard amazing things about it. I would love to clear my skin so I can feel comfortable wearing makeup again. I work for a makeup store and I feel embarrassed when my breakouts are bad. My scarring is also very red, it looks like acne sometimes but it’s not. I’ve had acne since a teen, tried antibiotics, birth control, OTC treatments, Murad/Proactive, etc. Monthly facials were most effective but to expensive over time and some cystic spots still wouldn’t budge. I have endometriosis which can make hormonal acne worse which makes this whole process even MORE frustrating. 

AM - La Roche Posay hydrating cleanser (this I’m keeping in my routine as I never broke out or purged with it), Dermalogica daily micro exfoliant(unsure if I should keep in routine), Vitamin C, Mario Bedascu Oil Free Moisturizer with SPF. I then used Clinique dramatically different oil free with inflammation pump if extra dry (lots of good reviews but I wasn’t crazy about it) 

PM - Clinique take the day away balm, La Roche Posay cleanser, Estee Lauder night repair serum, Clinique moisturizer, every other day with curology prescription niacinamide 4%, clindamycin 1%, zinc pyrithione 0.25% ( I would like to keep in routine). If I have pimples I use Fourth Ray sulfur spot treatment or persa gel 10. 

NEW Korean products - Klair supple preparation toner, mugwort essence, Wishtrend mandelic acid 5% water exfoliater , La Roche Posay moisturizer with SPF (for am), Klairs rich moisturizer (for PM) 

If you have any advice on how to use these properly let me know. I plan on using my curology every other day only at night. I want to use both La Roche in the AM, toner in the AM, essence in the AM. The mandelic exfoliator 1-2x a week with only moisturizer after in the PM. Sorry for any typos I’m on my phone :) Sorry for the long rant. Thank you so much for reading this :)"

When I finally had my appointment with her and told her all my symptoms and how I’d really like to see if I have endometriosis ... she thought I was lying. She told me it was all in my head. She asked if I had ever been sexually assaulted. I was confused and replied that I had been, but didn’t think that would be related. I had been having pain during sex, so I did mention that her. She then told me that I just needed to relax and stop thinking about what had happened to me during sex and the pain would go away. I was in shock. She told me to use lube next time and causally patted by back telling me just to “breathe through it.” I told her my pain wasn’t JUST during sex, but she was confident that my molestation as a child was the only reason behind my pain for 2 weeks in a month. I remember I just about ran out of that doctors office having a FULL BLOWN panic attack. I jumped in my car and started sobbing. I thought I was crazy. Luckily my husband convinced that I wasn’t.

bipolar,f9f2o38,t1_f9f1klt,1575257962.0,"Yes, it does unfortunately. I believe mostly that has to do with debt to income ratio and having access to euthanasia, as well as seeing some pretty terrible things. I wish it was different, but luckily I have support from a family member to help me with school if I do so decide to pursue actual vet school. I don’t enjoy anything else and volunteer a lot, so I’m aware of what goes on in clinics, I just can’t see myself doing anything else :/  But that does make having bipolar and being a vet that much harder! I’m looking into specialty practices for that purpose."
BipolarReddit,f7dtb94,t3_dvnp8c,1573628964.0,I think that would be great. It feels weird when you realize a minor is talking to you. Just isn’t the type of support I’m looking for. Lol I also would like to meet people 25+ because even 5 years makes a huge difference in maturity!
BipolarReddit,f7dro7x,t3_dv048j,1573626875.0,"I haven’t worked full time in well over 2 years. Part time seems to be all I can handle, but to be fair I haven’t taken my meds in quite awhile due to complications with health insurance (which I’m now figuring out and paying out of pocket). I’ve been honest with some employers, after I’ve been hired, and I’ve also lied. The ones I’ve lied too caused me much more grief and I usually quit after a few months or was fired due to missing shifts. I think depending on the group of people you work with honesty can get you a long way. However, I’ve decided to go back to school full time while I work part time and am pushing myself to pick a career where I can work less hours, and be more flexible.
I definitely think the type of job you have is tremendous. I don’t thrive on a 9-5 M-F lifestyle. Wish I could but I just can’t, so I’m making life choices that fit my bipolar better.

Forgot to add MOOD TRACKING is a great way to realize when you’re becoming manic. Stay away from sugar, alcohol, and caffeine when you realize you are. That’s the biggest advice I was ever given and still follow the best I can. Mood tracking will help you see if your mania is consistent and if you can plan around that. Hope that helps!"
BipolarReddit,f72gt1s,t3_du5ncl,1573362545.0,"I think it can. I try to avoid situations in which this will happen but it’s not always possible. I struggle mostly with triggers that effect my depressive episodes though, but I am Bipolar 2 and don’t experience mania quite so often. I feel like the smallest of things can make me seriously depressed, when things are seemingly okay in the morning, I can make an entire 360 depending on the situation. Currently I am experiencing this and it sucks."
BipolarReddit,f72g5t1,t3_du2vp4,1573361911.0,"Exercising, eating healthy, and meditating. Helps calm my anxiety as well. Wish there was more I could say but honestly those are the only things I notice that do anything for me. Also being around animals can help a lot! Volunteering at animal shelters is a good way to get out of the house, walking (with the dogs) and getting plenty of love from cats and dogs. Hope that helps!"
BipolarReddit,f6rlf8o,t3_dsmktz,1573108620.0,"This is a great post. I’ve been seeing therapists since I was 12, I’m 25 now, formally have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 and other various mental health issues. I finally found one I connect with at twenty-fucking-five. Finding a good therapist is NOT easy. I wish I could have told my younger self to not give up on therapy completely and be honest with myself when I didn’t like my previous ones. I’m happy to have found the one I’m with now. She encourages me to keep a mood journal, which has been very helpful. And document when I feel normal and happy rather than just the bad. Which is strange for me. She’s also done EMDR with me which has helped tremendously. Yay for good therapists!"
VetTech,ew1vl6s,t1_ew1vbzn,1565032432.0,I know right? I have a few friends who did Carrington or are still in their program and regret it mostly due to the cost. On the bright side though you passed and finished and loved your experience!! Many can’t say that anymore :) just pretend you went to a university lol!
VetTech,ew1vglo,t1_ew1v93k,1565032351.0,"Thank you! Cal Poly Pomona seems to be a great program, I’ll shoot you a message with some questions for sure since it’s been impossible to speak with an advisor out of state over the summer! Lol"
VetTech,ew1utz2,t1_ew1uifq,1565031952.0,"Yeah I had considered Carrington way back when but now it’s just turned into a money pit for most students. My issue with Cal Poly was it seems it is a 4 year bachelors degree vs usual 2 year associates. Mt Sac seems pretty great but I’m sure it is highly competitive - like you said as far as registering for classes, so I’ll have to jump on that ASAP if I decide that’s the route I want. My issue with Penn Foster is I am a hands on learner and I am nervous about where to find a externship and how much that externship will allow me to do without having any hands on training prior. I may still continue PF and see how far I can get until January but I also don’t want to waste my time. Thank you!!!’"
mildlyinteresting,er2pmoj,t3_c050y3,1560447654.0,"I’m really scared of escalators. It’s a phobia of mine. I’ve never HAD a bad experience on them but I get sweaty and nervous when I have to haul luggage on them at an airport, or step on one with heels on. I always hesitate before stepping on. If I have the option of stairs I will always take it. This is my worst nightmare."
aww,er2oilw,t3_c06pv6,1560447055.0,"My grandmother passed away in February and I miss her everyday. Her smile made my days so much brighter and she was my best friend. Give your grandma a hug today if you see her, this clip made my day."
