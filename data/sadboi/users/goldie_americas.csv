During this as we do online schooling together, I have been able to help build his confidence and help close some of the gaps that caused him to feel lost. I‚Äôm so grateful for his school system that has done a great job with the online work. It has made it easy and enjoyable for us to sit down together and do it. His confidence has grown and I was able to see the parts that have caused a struggle and take the time to work on it with him one on one. I didn‚Äôt know whether I would even move him on to 2nd grade next year (he‚Äôs a young 1st grader) because I didn‚Äôt want him to just keep feeling lost. But this time getting one-on-one instruction has made a huge difference for him, and I believe he is ready to move forward. We really needed this.
