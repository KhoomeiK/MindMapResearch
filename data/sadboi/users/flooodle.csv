I’m 20F go by spooky online and i’m in PST and i’m looking for more ladies to play with on PC! 
I’m not very competitive when it comes to gaming but i can be. I play overwatch and apex but i loooove csgo and want to play with other girls because online mm can be so awful with people harassing girls and calling us names.
I have other games that i want to play more like rainbow, minecraft, stardew valley, don’t starve, maybe league! 
pm me for my discord, steam, battlenet, etc :)"

needadvice,eydgcpe,t3_cwogms,1567018172.0,"I’m a 20F college student and i’ve had that same mindset since beginning of high school and i too want to change it - good to you for wanting to at 15! I talked to my therapist about wanting to be more open minded at school just this week and here’s some things she told me :
- the people who are “annoying” to you (maybe talk to much to the teacher or to other classmates) are probably annoying for a reason! Like for example maybe school is a safe place for them and it’s the only place they can feel heard or comfortable. 
- self talk. on your way to class/ school say to yourself that you are going to think differently. you’re gonna to go in with an open mind and think of people as potential friends and good people. 
- put yourself out there. it can be scary but try joining a club or talking to the people who sit around you - even if it is just small talk. other students are nervous too especially with this new school year starting so you’re not alone

and for comparing yourself, it sucks i know- i still struggle with it. social media can be really toxic so maybe filter your feed with things that make you happy like animal page accounts or memes. Try to stop yourself from looking at other peoples pages for too long and comparing yourself to them. For me I just have to catch myself in the act and be like “hey this doesn’t feel good, this girl is way prettier than me and i’m comparing myself to her. i gotta stop” so i’ll go off instagram for the rest of the night and do something else like go on reddit or talk to one of my friends. 

Another thing, you’re not a bad person for having these thoughts. it’s actually really good that you want to change them! I wish you the best of luck with it"
