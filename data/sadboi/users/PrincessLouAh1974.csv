Chriswatts,fggmfc1,t3_ewsvgs,1580764905.0,"Just watched this movie and it annoyed me so much. Why on earth did they cast an attractive olive skinned actress for NK when in real life she was a plain, pasty, mannish kinda girl.  They made Shanann annoying as hell and Chris who apparently is meant to have a high IQ was portrayed as a village idiot type character.  I really hated it."

neighborsnextdoor,eod07on,t3_brdo3s,1558466578.0,Never thought of that 👍🏻👍🏻
