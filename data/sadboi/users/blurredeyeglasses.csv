I think, at this point, there is no conclusive research as to how many times this cycle can be done on one mask and still be safe."

Something that I like to do to calm myself is listing a couple of things for each of the senses that I’m feeling right now: I close my eyes and I feel my dog, I feel the sun, I smell fresh laundry. It does sound a bit cheesy, but orienting myself to my surroundings like that helps me deal with the emotions of food and anxiety a little better. It doesn’t have to be perfect. Your food intake does not have to be perfect. You are fantastic the way that you are."

Reading helps me because it’s easy to lose track of time. So, hours go by without thinking about food, or at least being too invested to get up and get food."
