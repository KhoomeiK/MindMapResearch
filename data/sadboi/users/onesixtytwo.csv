Single parenting comes with a lot of fear but guess what, so does traditional two people parenting! No parent ever knows if they’re doing the right thing when raising their kid/s. But you’re starting on the right foot.. you’re leaving an unhappy marriage and showing your children you all deserve to be happy. I applaud you. This grief will pass and the future is unknown and exciting."

Good luck!"
