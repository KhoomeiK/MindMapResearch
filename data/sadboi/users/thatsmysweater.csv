And they’re nice quotes and all, and the intentions behind them are usually good.  There can be truth in those statements as well.  That said, it almost invalidates the natural human response that many of us have experienced that have affected our lives *drastically*.  Humans are by nature social creatures.  We are hardwired to respond to one another emotionally and to stay connected.  

If another human says or does something horrible to us, it is natural for us to wonder *“What have I done wrong to make this other human that has a significant impact on my survival dislike me?”*

To be impacted by other people’s behavior and words is to be human.  Of course we’ll have a hard time believing in ourselves if other humans have hurt us repeatedly.  Of course we could be prone to depression and anxiety and low self-esteem.  We’ve experienced trauma and we’re having a biological response to it.

Yes, we can create our own happiness to a certain degree, but we can’t just disregard the affect that abusers can have on our entire lives.  Y’know?

I dunno.  That’s just my theory.  I am not a therapist or anything.  It just felt like it’s kind of in the same vein so I thought I’d share my ideas.

A while ago it was the idea that people around me would blame themselves, especially my ex since I started to feel suicidal again near a breakup, but that driving force slowly started to leave and now it doesn’t matter to me.  If I died of causes other than suicide, people would still find ways to blame themselves because that’s how grieving works, so it lost its effectiveness for me.  Even if it’s partially a reason, I also feel like me saying “my ex would blame himself” to people I trusted to help me made them all feel as though I was pulling the “if you don’t come back to me I’ll kill myself” card and being manipulative.  In reality, it was simply me saying “hey, I am reaching out to get help because the only thing keeping me alive right now is the fact that (ex) will blame himself and that’s not okay”.  I sincerely understand where they might be coming from.  It hurts that there’s that deep-seeded misunderstanding, but I get it.  I just don’t know what to say to explain myself.

My therapist has given me a lot of wake up calls: “Hey, thatsmysweater, that incident you described as a common thing is not normal and is actually traumatic.”

EMDR has helped immensely.  I will say that I am having a very difficult time as I’m in the beginning stages of unpacking my trauma, but I’m weirdly not  suicidal.  I’m just tired, sad, anxious.  It’s more similar to cleaning a wound.  It *hurts* a lot, but it needs to be opened and cleaned before it can heal.  But I know that I will live.  The “I want to fucking kill myself” breakdowns have been few and far between, and life just overall seems more manageable.

I will also throw in that C-PTSD is also notorious for masquerading itself as Bipolar II.  I was diagnosed with Bipolar II about 3 years ago, but my therapist thinks that we can revisit that diagnosis once all of my trauma is unpacked and we see what’s left.

Here’s a link to some of my favorite pictures of Bleu Cheese, so you guys can see him!  I’m a little biased, but I think he’s probably one of the cutest cats I’ve *ever* seen.  He was the definition of a forever kitten—super playful, naturally tiny, and super adorable.  He lived to be 3 years old. Anyone close to me knows how important he and his brother Puppycat were to me.  They may have been just cats, but they were the only constant during a period of craziness when I got them when I turned 18 and had to find my way on my own.  Sounds silly, but hey.  They were my roommates, my best friends, and my emotional support, lmao.  I’m a shameless cat lady, I guess.

I had to make the difficult decision to put Bleu to sleep when some neurological issues started to get out of hand.  I loved him very much, and the decision was devastating because he was completely healthy on the outside.  His brain just got sick.  It fucks with my own head sometimes—and I often feel myself feeling guilty even though I know it was for the best.  That weekend was rough.  I almost lost my apartment, my boyfriend left me, a family member had a heart attack, etc., and so processing the grief of losing Bleu sat on the backburner for a while.  I’m doing well, now.  Things have *somewhat* settled down, and I felt ready to try to do something to relieve the grief.  I’m really glad I did."

They’re also stupid inexpensive, like $6.99 a bottle I think and usually on sale.  They’re my go to because I’m a little bitch when it comes to booze."
toastme,ffl3cx2,t1_ffkreh9,1580034059.0,"I was in a very similar situation recently, like *very* similar.  I know how much it hurts.  It’s a new kind of pain—I almost wish I had never felt the bliss of finding such an incredible person so suddenly, because I am having a hard time being peaceful with my singleness again.  It was so good, and it hurts so deeply that it didn’t go well.  I keep telling myself that it was for the best, that I’ll find peace within my singleness again.

You and I will get there.  You’re so, so strong.  Please don’t listen to your friends when they say “get over it”.  It’s important to sit with your feelings and allow yourself to feel, and then move on when you’re ready.  Remember that the process isn’t linear either.  You will have good days, and you will have bad days when you least expect it."
relationship_advice,ff5cylk,t1_ff5ckir,1579587750.0,"Certainly.  I think I’m just trying to avoid the ugly fallout until after the wedding, almost in an effort to do “damage control”.  I look 10x shittier as a person if I bail on her wedding stuff, or leave her right before her wedding and make her emotional.  I know that she will definitely feel very sad when I end things.  I don’t want to make her sad before the wedding, you know?  I feel like I can’t have that in my conscience.  I know that doesn’t really add up when you consider the things she’s done to me, and how sad she makes me feel on a daily basis, but... yeah."

I’m currently in therapy, working through a lot of childhood trauma that resulted in me accepting relationships in which I’m the “doormat”.  I am definitely working on getting better so that I don’t fall into these kinds of relationships anymore."

I’ve been in denial over the fact that I’m probably *absurdly* lactose intolerant for years.  But now that I’ve started to gradually cut out dairy/lactose, I’m now realizing that if I have even just a little bit of dairy my stomach hurts like a bitch.  This is so exciting!"

selfhelp,fdcdfsk,t3_ekj0ip,1578272203.0,"One of the most difficult things I’ve had to learn to accept is that most of the time, there is no “why.”
We can drive ourselves mad with thinking of a thousand reasons why.   We could think of hundreds of reasons that put us at peace, but we could also think of a hundred reasons that make us hurt even more.  It’s not fair to torture yourself with the “why”.
Healing hurts, it does, but the first step is to let go of the “why” and accept that things are over.  It’s hard and it sounds way less boring/more difficult than whatever else we’d usually like to do after a breakup, but I promise you that the acceptance of it really is the defining step towards helping yourself improve.

Look back fondly, with appreciation.  Or, look back with an anger that fuels you into loving yourself more fiercely than ever.   Or a mix of both.  Whatever pushes you forward.

Do you have a hobby you haven’t paid as much attention to?  Give it your attention.  Do you have a book or a movie or a show you’ve been telling yourself to watch/read, but haven’t gotten around to it?  Get around to it, now.   Plunge yourself into doing things instead of just saying you’ll do them.  It helps.  A lot."
