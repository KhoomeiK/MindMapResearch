ibs,fdtyz70,t3_en15sx,1578724562.0,It has helped me a lot in the past. When my symptoms were especially bad I used to use the capsules (both ways) and it really did help decrease swelling and pain tremendously. Sadly I don't have access to them right now but will be getting them again someday.
ptsd,fdsp9zn,t3_emw904,1578706185.0,"Yes, he helps a lot- but for the sake of others relating/being aware he didn't help at first how I planned.

I studied, learned how to teach SDiT tasks, and planned for a few years before getting my guy- very excitedly waiting and hoping until the right opportunity came along.

Then as soon as I got that puppy I was hit with a few weeks of almost postpartum blues. I was so confused what was happening to me- wasn't this everything I wanted? But for some reason I cried a lot and was depressed (don't worry, he was still cared for and my spouse helped me tremendously).

When I confided in my therapist she gently explained this happens sometimes to those with (C)PTSD, and advised me to reach out to others who've gone through it.  I never would've imagined something like that could've happened, but a lot of others go through it as well and I learned I wasn't alone.

Now three years later he helps me so much, and I'm endlessly grateful to have him. He alerts to me a lot, helps get me out of the house, and makes me laugh with his goofy personality. I'm lucky to have him. Still I wish to let others know that if you end up feeling a lot of mixed, confusing emotions after you get your pup that it's okay- you're not alone and you won't feel that way long!"
