I went out and found some good quality goods, found it, and didn't feel anything much after 7 FUCKIN DAYS AWAKE. I just felt a bit slower and dumb, but I was still very much aware of normal things, could function and perform normally, didn't look or act much differently at all, I mean my short term memory was iffy however, and I never got paranoia or hallucinations. 

Every now and then even one night skipped of sleep and I can get auditory hallucinations but mostly mild and it's mistaking sounds or others talking with hearing a friend(that is present) talk.

Every single time I got any mild hallucination(only auditory thusfar) I pop my antipsychotic and get some rest. I don't even hesitate a minute.

Anyway, I can't believe 7 days didn't throw me off any kind of deep end, as I have a plethora of mental illness, namely bipolar type 2.

Amphetamines always treated me well and never gave me a high, I'm hoping to finally get insurance soon and get on a legitimate prescription (that I'd never abuse and keep in a locked box)"

meth,fdmm5uc,t1_fdmjjr6,1578555228.0,"Drugs are such a fuckin mess in the world today.

We have these studies sayin the neurotoxicity of meth is super prominent when most the studies saying this gave a lot more meth per dose to the rats than what a person should ever take(by comparison), or didn't take into account other factors, etc

There's not even much known of long term use of meth (from what I've seen so far, I'm still lookin around) 

I think a lot of people come at this from the wrong angle, a lot of times it's not about the drug it's about the person using the drug(neurochemistry, age, various predispositions, personality, whatever) and the environment of the person using the drug (past and present)

I just really fuckin hate the light being shined on drugs in our modern world, with criminalization leading to harm / death / control tactics / etc, media making certain aspects of the environment forced around the drug seem like it is BECAUSE of the drug, scare tactics, lack of harm reduction, and most of us holding beliefs based on assumptions or what we're told. There's plenty of us who base our views/beliefs on anecdotal experiences or insecurity or whatever else too. 


I'm not tryna say all this is fact and I'd be accepting of corrections or nudges in the right direction, but it's what I've gathered so far which I expect to change over time.


Personally, I've struggled heavily my entire life mentally and the areas I've been in provide such little help. Mental health care is a biggol gray area in the USA and I'm sure elsewhere as well. I go thru a low income mental health facility doing outpatient services and they've almost killed me multiple times for example refusing to understand that my amplified depression and obsessive thoughts and self harm upon cessation of SSRIs which lasted months(Idk how long it'd last yet) actually had a correlation, I had to learn myself over years of relapsing on shit like zoloft. They never found out I had bipolar2 and I've experienced psychosis before a psych in another state diagnosed me which has helped. Finding others' stories, grasping at straws to figure out what the fuck was goin on.

In the past year I've heavily realized the actual effect ADHD has had on my life (I was diagnosed earlier in life but my parents didn't care about continuing any kind of treatment, well they were opioid addicts so it was hard for them) and I'm honestly just scared to attempt to find treatment, I just endlessly read about it all and I focus a lot on how drugs effect us/the brain. I'm slowly inching my way up learning the basics and shit.


I had one experience with an amphetamine before my recent abuse of meth and it's when a friend gave me one of his Vyvanse 2 or 3 years ago when I was 20. Lemme tell ya my guy, it was somethin fuckin ethereal. I had spent months upon months in a dissociated trance maybe years idk, fiending to keep up my marijuana habit (yes...people do fiend for this drug sometimes), barely finding any kind of interest or attachment to the world around me. Couldn't focus on any games or anything. Then I popped it, and I felt the dissociation melt away. I felt calm, I felt intensely immerged in this life I had forgotten I was even a part of, I wanted to go outside and see things and I wanted to understand things, I wanted to connect to people but not like obsessively or anything. My thoughts/actions weren't so compulsive for once. I felt I could finally see past this terrible fog in my head and found, for pretty much the first time, clarity. 

It's similar with meth, just added side effects (strains my body plenty) and a pretty fuckin terrible ROA and long effects. This has been my story so far. There's noone able to see the future and tell me that I'd for sure end up suckin dick for meth regardless of if they did or saw others do it or saw so many people start off like me. 

I don't plan to or want to continue using this drug the way I am or even at all, there are opportunities to find professional help and opportunities to help myself. 


It's always refreshing to find connection and understanding, I've found it unexpectedly very often.

God fuck, fentanyl is a short high for me but SO GOOD LIKE FULL BODY ORGASM

Idk, I was introduced into opioids by kratom and I had a bad addiction with it on the spot, and it took some time to recover(PAWS) so I couldn't imagine an even rougher addiction/withdrawal so idk just too fuckin scared of opiates."

meth,fdcu5i0,t1_fdctg2r,1578284394.0,"I smoked a bowl of weed and resparked my fuckin meth high from before work lmao so I'm rollin a bit.

Yeah I just learned on my antidepressant and because I have mental illness, the comedowns hit harder and longer and withdrawal is even worse because my antidepressant put me in a sort of equilibrium and meth is overpowering that so I come up, get even extra serotonin from comorbid enzyme inhibition, and fall deeper and take longer to recover than normal, bc I'm on effexor mostly but mental illness itself is that way to a lesser degree.

All my symptoms that my meds treated come back worse in a comedown or withdrawal from meth so it fuckin sucks yo."

I have a lot of other friends and I still haven't lost them, I'm just stuck either at work or at my dad's apartment without a car and without social interaction so the mental aspect digs even deeper lol

Edit: yeah I see the prey aspect pretty well too. Would explain some of my friendships and close friendships of the past."

meth,fdcokdk,t1_fdcn0gd,1578280086.0,"Yeah I get you man, I know both I and them use for drugs lol. That typa shit.

I relate to a lot of what you said but tbh I love vulnerability, theories, and I'm hoping to delve into neuroscience/neurology. I love havin good ass talks along these lines. Otherwise it's a lotta small chat, u rite.

Or are you talkin about bc of meth my personality has began changing? It was this before medication.

Effexor is an SNRI, and pretty effectively treats my intense generalized anxiety disorder and does good for my depression.

I think the symptoms my effexor was helping me with is coming back worse because of meth. Like, coming off of it. I've seen some ppl say it can last like a week even from shorter use.

What a shitty situation, I can become borderline suicidal just because of this. It's fuckin stupid. I do want out, yo. I'm a kinda smart guy, I don't believe I'm predisposed to meth addiction but I do believe I'm getting there. I'm already addicted, for sure but I can see an exit. It's just like, I'm lost though. Alas, that's addiction I guess. That's the game plenty of us play.


Dumb of me to get into any heavy drug(and most drugs in general) while being prescribed a treatment plan for mental illness. Lmao. Live and learn, I hope."
Drugs,fdcly24,t3_d13j6b,1578278193.0,"Mmmmmm before I built my opioid tolerance, tramadol was my fuckin fave. Stimulating and lasted a good amount of time. Only took 50mg for awhile. Good shit."
meth,fdcloin,t1_fdcko11,1578277999.0,"I also have to add: I am being treated with an antidepressant called Effexor which both treats my anxiety disorder and depression(for depression I mix with antipsychotic bc I'm bipolar2)

So like, meth is makin effexor not really do its job. My moods get swingy, I think pretty negatively, generalized anxiety attaches to my being and tries to throw me in a spiral of hopelessness and fear (mostly when I'm coming off it, like haven't taken it in a couple days so I'm fucking terrified of stopping my daily use even if it's only been a few weeks long)"
meth,fdcle82,t1_fdcko11,1578277796.0,"23 years young, yeah my gut tells me to just not hang with the people who have been finding me grams to buy.

I'll try my best to just keep it a bit steady for a several days or so maybe get a decent smoke sess in nothin big tho, do some oral doses for the rest of the days(not passing like a week or so) until I run out.

A lot of what you said I relate to, my ADHD makes me not think before I say. I am INFP. Yeah I work at a grocery store, and am normally a people pleaser(but in a good way) so on meth I find even more pleasure in being nice and chatting up the older customers. Without an ADHD med though, I don't think I can work more than part time hours sadly. I am a mixture of a dude who fucked with shitty friends with a meth pipe and a dude who's stuck self medicating ADHD because he has no insurance or access to proper help. I'm way more so the first one, though."
meth,fdcj56o,t1_fdchsl9,1578276189.0,"I use mostly alone yes, the thing you said about expecting the effects I think really could be a big effect on me. When I use with friends, I tend to get really talkative and allat.

When I'm using by myself it does seem to get more on the negative side.


I also think I could be suffering sorta comedown effects from previous days use and I don't use too consistently but I smoke like 5 or 6 hits from the pipe, nothin monstrous but medium/average hits I guess. Guessing under 20-30mg or so most days? 

Some days I'll only hit the pipe a few times and that's it, no redose, with the mindset that I don't wanna run up my tolerance and make my dependency even heavier than I am already beginning to make it.


Idunno man, I just smoked a bowl of some good ass weed and I'm overanalyzing like I love to do."
meth,fdcgy2v,t1_fdcgifj,1578274633.0,Also yeah my mindset is super up and down especially since starting to use most days. A couple days off is usually when I get hit with intense anxiety or depression and it shakes me up for multiple days afterwards lol
meth,fdcguka,t1_fdcgifj,1578274565.0,"I've heard that and been thinking about it a lot. It does seem to perpetuate my mood more than anything, I don't get all happy on it especially not consistently and I was thinking this could be why.

You think if I'm already bored with things, it'll make me more bored? Unlike marijuana which helps me be less bored when I am bored."
meth,fdceasi,t1_fdcddme,1578272790.0,"Oh yeah I know it's shitty gear but I'm more so meaning meth in general doesn't send me to happyland, but with this batch I got I only had it last night and not even much today - not being well nourished and whatnot. 

After some good food and a good night's sleep I'll update you on how it feels tomorrow. I'm gonna take an oral dose to start my workday and hit the pizzle a little. Work day today sucked, I was starving and gonna be nauseated regardless of drug usage.

Idk if it's because I have ADD or not, but no amphetamine has given me energy. Just a kind of clarity or slight sense of control.

But yeah, considering who I went thru to get it - it is not going to be great meth."

Wellbutrin helps any fatigue I have for sure, I love it for that. I use it with effexor (and an antipsychotic) now.

My experience isn't really one to go off of though, sadly I am dependent on SSRI/SNRIs and fall into depression, anxiety, obsessive thinking, all that bad stuff whenever I try going off them and so far it's lasted months and I couldn't handle it and relapsed. Almost killed myself a few times. Dark times."
meth,fd89s9q,t1_fd899j7,1578215605.0,"Sadly enough when I stopped using almost a week ago(only been using for a few weeks before then) I fell into that deep intense anxiety ridden lonely depressed state. I had to take small oral dose just to feel okay. Did that a couple times, made it better by the time I jumped off again. Here I am now, hotrailing for the first time.... Fuck me man. I'm dooming myself lmao."
