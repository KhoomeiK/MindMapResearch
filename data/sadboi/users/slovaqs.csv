EDAnonymous,fbi5wyj,t3_eddf7q,1576891699.0,"So true. I wanted help so bad in the beginning (I was just as disordered but I wasnt underweight), I secretly used to wish people would be concerned for me or notice i barely eat anything and go to the gym and take long ass walks and even black out as a result but no one cared or said anything, as a matter of fact some people even congratulated me on having so much self control. Fast forward to now and everyoneeee is commenting saying i should eat more and i lost so much and its getting ""worrisome"" and i hate it so much because I'm way past the point of wanting people to notice. It's too late now. I don't want any help, I want to be left alone."

eating_disorders,fbadkch,t3_ec919w,1576675023.0,"No, I dont think its possible for your ED to change your body type. Some people just naturally store more fat in certain places than others (like my sister stores more in her lower body than her upper body and I am the exact opposite), some naturally store it evenly, etc. Also your bone structure contributes to that and your ED can't change that. I think maybe the only thing that could make it seem like that would be getting bloated easier and more often because EDs do cause that"

  They would jerk off under their desk beforehand so it was hard. It was so disgusting. 
  Also lots of ""couples"" dry humping eachother on desks during break and a lot of getting groped as you walk down the hallway or getting your ass slapped."
