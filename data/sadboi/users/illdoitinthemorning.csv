BPD,eu8xb2a,t3_cf6gc1,1563566810.0,"It’s fine, but try to see it from my perspective. How would YOU feel if I told you *insert similar “hypothetical” thing here that is much more hurtful and sure to get under their skin and escalate the situation*."
BPD,eu6ihva,t3_ceykzo,1563501072.0,Is this related to the BPD or just something everyone does? It happens to me almost every day.
BPD,etq3v6c,t3_ccwn1y,1563071903.0,And then when your cries for attention just push people away further. Cycle of doom.
BPD,etp2a63,t1_etoh6b5,1563043794.0,True. I suppose there’s a difference between carrying the emotion with you after the show ends and carrying a personality with you.
BPD,etnjb7v,t3_ccjchq,1562989034.0,"Does this seriously not happen to everyone??? I had no idea this was a BPD thing, I thought it happened to everyone. When I watch shows/movies with immersive elements I am always left feeling as if I *am* one of the characters in some way and I take on all associated emotion. I legitimately thought this was just normal..."
BPD,etbzya3,t3_cax6ne,1562670100.0,"I think it totally is. Sex is a great way to emotionally manipulate people and make them like you and feel attached to you. That’s classic BPD. 

On a less complex level, orgasms are intense and a temporary escape from reality. Those are also things I crave."
BPD,etbziys,t1_etaso6v,1562669573.0,"Maybe that’s what I need. Some artistic way to express or embody intensity without real life consequences. It sounds like you’ve found a healthy way of feeding that addiction, which is great."
BPD,et9awmk,t1_et8vv99,1562591937.0,"Same here. I crave stability and security in order to feel safe, so I try to create routine in my life. It seems healthy. But then that routine ends up boring me and turning my life into a blur, and eventually suffocating. 

My BPD makes me addicted to intensity. But intensity is a high that comes with consequences, like stress or lost money or broken relationships... 

It’s so hard to balance all of this."
BPD,esqg129,t3_c8vqnd,1562201764.0,"Yeah and it’s super unpredictable. I surprise myself when it comes out, and when I try hard sometimes I fall completely flat. I wish I felt like I had more control over when I’m charming and when I’m awkward."
BPD,esnyrwd,t3_c8koyc,1562154964.0,"I totally agree. I think the underlying issue here with my own BPD is that I’m consistently unable to work through/heal my own pain without another person’s attention or “rescue”. I seek attention because I fundamentally lack the ability to self-soothe, and that gets picked up on from the people I lean on. To them, it probably feels like I’m transferring the responsibility of healing my pain rather than just seeking empathy. 

As another dimension to this, I also hate sharing emotional space with others. My pain is so BIG and so INTENSE that I need to engage in attention-seeking behaviors to establish that there is only capacity in the relationship (at that point in time) for my emotional state. There’s no space for their pain, because I’m already experiencing too much intensity to handle anything additional, and I need their 100% focus on rescuing ME. 

Or else the world will fall apart."
BPD,esmyexj,t3_c8hcnd,1562118090.0,Oh 100%. Especially during sex
BPD,esmy83u,t1_esl9tsl,1562117947.0,"It feels like my emotions fuel me like an engine during my episodes. When I’m in a balanced state, I tend to get bored and crave that feeling of extreme emotion just for the thrill and energy."
BPD,esmy0vk,t3_c88tcg,1562117791.0,"DAE intentionally drop things into conversation with your significant other you know will hurt them emotionally, but play dumb as if it was an innocent mistake, just to see how they react?"
BPD,esjdb77,t1_esjb5sf,1562030842.0,Therapists have been telling me to hold ice cubes since I was 5 years old. Never works
BPD,esiyzj1,t1_esicckq,1562022906.0,"I also get dead limbs, and completely lose the ability to speak (selective mutism). When I’m a rage state, I sometimes even hear voices and I lose all sense of time. The only thing so far that has been able to snap me out of it and bring me back into my body is self harm. :("
BPD,esixgh9,t1_esimr3g,1562022085.0,"Yep. Or how about this instead: Jumping right in at a group creating an awesome personality intuitively on the spot. It works great and everyone is charmed, but the one friend you came to the party with keeps giving you looks like “who the fuck are you?” and you have to avoid eye contact because they know “you” and it might throw off your persona if you’re reminded of the person you usually are around them."
BPD,esiwo3l,t1_esig7wk,1562021665.0,All the time. I’m triggered constantly by my own healed scars too
