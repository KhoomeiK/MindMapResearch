Their hive mind mentality is absolutely sickening. I also hate war. Why must people kill each other to solve problems? *How* does it solve problems? Oh we don't like this other country, lets nuke it it'll solve everything.  So on top of everything else I have to go to sleep at night wondering how many ways I'll be killed before morning. Oh, and the pandemic thing, something that could have been brought under control if the governments of the world weren't so selfish and stupid right from the start, doesn't help either.
