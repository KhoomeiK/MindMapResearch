When you think about it, it’s equally possible, if not more possible, that her helping you work through the stuff going on with your mother is actually something she finds really empowering and heartening in a professional way, rather then her finding it a burden. 

Also, it’s quite likely that she has her mother stuff mostly sorted out, in that she’s likely at a place now where her mother’s behavior doesn’t significantly impact her life and the ways her mother hurt her have been worked on. This could potentially give her an advantage to empathizing with you and thinking critically regarding your situation. 

I don’t know anything about you beyond your post, but as a few suggested questions to ask yourself; do you feel like she’s judging you now, by comparing her mother with yours? Do you see your T like a mother? If so, could that be playing into this? Do you maybe feel overly exposed or fear connection/vulnerability?"

This rigidity is especially shitty when it comes to trauma in the form of CPTSD. I am of the belief that the resistance to including CPTSD in the DSM is mostly political, where including it as a diagnosis would mean that those who have CPTSD due to poverty, for instance, could hold the government accountable for their trauma, since it would be formally recognized and diagnosable as a mental illness/disability. Having therapists who only recognize phenomena that’s formally recognized, in my opinion, is problematic to say the least.

TalkTherapy,fgm1yac,t1_fglzb3n,1580916323.0,"I'm glad my response was helpful!

I don't get what she was going for with that ""very well"" response when you described a traumatic indecent that happened to you. And further...

>She has never even used the word “trauma” to describe what I went through, even though every other therapist I met used those terms... she said I can’t have PTSD since I am not the victim of sexual assault or a life-threatening situation, which is true, but I wish she weren’t so dismissive of my pain as thought it’s doesn’t warrant a clinical term.

...I think this is awful, and once again seems to point to her having an 'all-or-nothing' approach to these sorts of things. You can have trauma without having PSTD, and there's also complex-PTSD, which she seems to have completely ignored. Things like growing up in a hoarder home and living in a shitty motel absolutely would traumatic for the vast majority of people. Maybe she thinks that validating that you have trauma would somehow be detrimental to you, but I don't know she would think that.

Maybe she would be open to changing her \~super logical\~ approach with you? Perhaps she thought that approach is helpful for you or she doesn't realize that she's being too rigid. There also could also be something of value to be found in you trying to work through this with her and discuss your feelings regarding her dismissiveness, but this would only work if she's able to not get defensive.  Based on what you've said, I don't have much faith in her at this point, but if you enjoy seeing her and have a good relationship all things considered, it could be worth a shot.

Good luck with it all! These kinds of situations aren't easy."
TalkTherapy,fgm0mp0,t3_ezakb7,1580915468.0,"It's possible that she was concerned that if you did try anything, it would come back to her, in that it would make her look incompetent if she condoned your quitting therapy and left it at that, and then shortly after, you acted on suicidal ideation. I don't really think this is acceptable of her, though. It also very possible she was genuinely concerned. She knows you much better than I do. But, on that note, you know her much better than I do.

I totally get why you feel that she was trying to coerce you; I would probably feel the same way. However, the idea that she called the cops to coerce you into staying in therapy with her is a bit of an extreme explanation for what happened, and I would be careful of taking this idea as actually being the case. Unless she's indicated to you that she has control issues going on, or has a failing client list, I don't think she would have enough to gain from coercing you into staying in therapy with her. Just based on your post, I would guess that she was worried she missed something or had a reason to think you might try to act on suicidal ideation, and her justification for calling the cops would most likely be out of concern, though there definitely could be some self-interest involved too.

She could have also had reasons to think that you quitting therapy was a very risky and unhealthy choice for you overall, and this could be because she is actually concerned about you, or she could have issues with needing to prove to herself that she can ""fix"" all of her clients.

This is all to say that there are multiple ways to explain her action. Based on what you've described in your post, I disagree with her calling the cops on you, but I also think that believing she was trying to coerce you into continuing to be her client is too strong of a take on her action. Either way, though, from what you've posted, it seems like you two aren't a good fit at all.

If you're open to it, it might be a good idea to have a termination session, where you share your feelings and views about her as a therapist and her calling the cops on you. However, this should only be for your sake, and there is no need to see her again if you think that doing so would do more harm than good."
TalkTherapy,fglyl32,t3_eza44m,1580914090.0,">She says that my OCD is trying to convince me that OCD is good

I really don't like what she said here. It's very pathologizing, sort of infantilizing, and considerably black-and-white. Maybe she was trying to suggest that there are ""better"" ways to find confidence in your morals, but she could have said that in a less cruddy way. And even if she had, it does sound like she wasn't appreciating the fact that you were finding something good in something that is, all things considered, shitty. If this is what was going on, I don't really get her reasoning here, since I think your line of reasoning and intentions are quite positive and healthy. It's not like you're saying you want the intrusive thoughts back or that seeing a silver lining will make them come back. 

It's also possible she didn't get where you were coming from, but by the sounds of it, you tried to explain your position to her, and she wasn't receptive. However, I don't know you like your therapist does, and she could have her reasons, possibly good reasons, for taking the approach she did. 

...but, considering her views on porn and the Super Bowl halftime show, it sounds like she has some sort of all or nothing, moral rigidity going on and is unable to leave this at the door when she's being your therapist. I really don't like that she is making claims which disregarded research. Like, she doesn't seem to look into research before making such claims, nor does she seem to change her views in light of research (unless she did, with the porn?). So, all in all, I would be quite skeptical of her regarding these sorts of topics.  Though, once again, I don't know her nor you, so I can't really make any strong claims on what she's actually like and am just speculating based on your post. 

My advice really depends on how you want to move forward with this. You could bring up how she responded to your point on intrusive thought, explaining that you weren't trying to say that intrusive thought are good, just that you were finding something of value in them in a way that doesn't lead to an 'all-or-nothing' view on the value of intrusive thoughts and OCD. You could call her out directly, if that's your style; that is, you could bring it up to her in a head-on way, directly explaining how you perceived her response, why you didn't like it, and ask her if she can clarify her view and her reasons for saying what she did. Either way, good luck! I would be frustrated too."

The abuser’s shift of blame is rarely conscious; it’s more like they’re reacting through a defense mechanism implicit in their mind. 

All of this is to say that your best bet is to get out of the relationship. Abusers only accept that they’re abusive through they’re own realizations.

Some days (or hours of the day) I feel super-powered; I’m fairly socially “with it,” at least in my own way—my mind seems to be working fast as hell in that I can bang out an entire, well written essay in a few hour—I’m able to make and then share interesting/out of the box insights I have in my classes—etc. Other days, if I’m feeling crappy or didn’t sleep well or whatever, I can barely talk or think.

Edit: typo"
SPD,fg5mb54,t3_ewvb03,1580531444.0,"I do! I’m autistic, and I believe SPD is considered to be a part of the spectrum, so perhaps there’s some overlap between your SPD and other “autistic traits.”"
mentalhealth,fg5lmqp,t1_fg5d0p7,1580530890.0,"Exactly, it’s that misplacement of our pursuit of happiness. I feel like we’re all so used to commodifying ourselves and being “productive,” “successful” members of society at the expense of our own happiness, that we turn to quick fixes hide the fact that we’re not really happy at all."
CPTSD,fg5fwf7,t1_fg4a2yw,1580526377.0,"I’ve heard successful therapy often involves the client’s internal voice shifting to something similar to their therapist’s, though this will only happen if you have a strong alliance with your therapist."

aspergirls,fg11rxl,t3_evy90g,1580419187.0,"Seconding *Spectrum Women*! I’ve only read it and one other book on autistic women. 

The other is *Women and Girls with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Understanding Life Experiences from Early Childhood to Old Age*. I personally hated it. I found it belittling and pathologizing."
bulimia,fg0v735,t3_ew0l9g,1580415665.0,"I hate that. I don’t know the context for your post, but I feel SO unsafe when that happens. Like I get to bed, days over—I’ve won, or at least am safe from my ED until the next day—and then, I’m crawling out of bed, eating my words."

autism,ffxjoh7,t1_ffxhw8r,1580326503.0,"They do not. What they do suggest, and directly argue, is that such categories are fundamentally linked to normative standards—ones that, as it currently stands, are based on ideas stemming from ableism. Science is not separate from culture and societal norms, and while this doesn’t in anyway mean that science is wrong or unscientific, it does mean that we need to examine science for any unintentional, implicit motives. Good science is one that recognizes and states its biases in an explicit and clear way."
autism,ffxh4mg,t1_ffxgf9r,1580325036.0,"I’m not saying there’s not a validity to the idea of different needs depending on the nature and severity of the condition or disability, nor do I have some personal bone to pick with the HF/LF distinction. I was making reference to some very well argued objections, from the field of philosophy, made against the medical model of disability."
autism,ffxf9b7,t1_ffwq8rz,1580323955.0,"The measures of functionality used by the medical model of disability/conditions are actually terrible and have been contested by those within disabled rights groups. Like, the HF/LF distinction rests on normative standards and furthers ableism. It perpetuates this idea that HF is always better than LF, because measures of functioning are fundamentally tied to normative judgements on what a person ‘should’ be able to do—and if a person isn’t able to function in a proper way, they’re regarded as being lower in status than those who can function in that way."
AspiePartners,ffuc0zg,t1_ffr87do,1580238799.0,"As a side note: for some on the spectrum, it goes the other way in that they can become more affectionate the more they unmask. I wonder why that is, personality I guess?"

aspergers,ffrycwo,t3_euv4gw,1580168705.0,"Occasionally I do. I also have an issue where sometimes I’ll begin to fall asleep and start to dream, but be too conscious, and the dream always goes haywire and wakes me up. Multiples times I’ve fallen asleep and dreamed I was grabbing my phone, then I’d realize it was a dream, and the phone screen would suddenly get so bright that it would wake me right up. It’s bizarre."
