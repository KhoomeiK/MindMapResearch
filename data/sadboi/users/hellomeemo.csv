bipolar,fh2lrtt,t3_f10a2h,1581257252.0,I didn't know I had PTSD from childhood abuse as well as bipolar until I was in my twenties. I just thought I was a wimp and I just have to tough it out. I didn't even know I was suffering from panic and anxiety attacks all throughout highschool. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
bipolar,fgfepxs,t1_fgfe0wd,1580736542.0,"Hi! Thank you so much!!

I've been looking at apps and have used the bike in the gym before quite a few times, but thinking about using weights and the other machines that I want to use makes me so anxious!

Thanks again and I'll try to keep all these in mind!!"
bipolar,fgfbx57,t1_fgfbsw5,1580733842.0,"Sadly, no instructors or classes. Just a gym with pretty good equipment. I'll try using weights like you said! Thank you for the advice! :)"

science,f7h77ct,t1_f7ffdrf,1573734082.0,My Galaxy Fit is actually doing a pretty good job of tracking my sleep! Pretty accurate with the sleep time and the awake time too!
bipolar,f6hyl0o,t3_dr969u,1572868262.0,I've been having problems remembering things the past few months. Not even my trusty journal or to-do list are able to help me lately as I've been forgetting things almost instantly. How do you guys deal with this?
IWantToLearn,eyyx3rh,t3_czj48s,1567604196.0,"I'm terribly lazy and I will do ANYTHING to lengthen my ""slack off time."" Because of my intense laziness, I realized these:

1. Make a list of things you need to do, and distribute them within the week. Try to break down the big things into smaller things so when you cross them off your checklist, it would feel nice!

2. Try to do what you need to do during the day. I actually tend to stop working a little after lunch time and I just do no-brainer things for the rest of the day.

3. You don't have to do everything all at the same time. Multitasking is actually very inefficient. It's a lot better to focus on one task and do it well, and take a break after. You'll feel more accomplished, and you wouldn't have to worry about making mistakes!

4. Think of a reward! For me, after I finish what I planned to do, I take a walk outside the office and get myself a chocolate bar, or a brownie!

Hope this helps!"
