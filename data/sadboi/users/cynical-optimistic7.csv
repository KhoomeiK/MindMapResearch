And remember, by being persistent and making smart choices like this one, that's how you'll eventually feel better. Keep going, i'm rooting for you!"
mentalhealth,fomhsnm,t3_g7zq6x,1587890531.0,"Altough I don't know you, that makes me so happy to hear. As a person struggling with mental health and knowing how difficult depression and suicidal thoughts are to endure, it makes me really happy when i find out that someone dedeated their demons. I wish you nothing but the best!"
depressed,ffjflls,t1_ffir1gg,1579997214.0,"I did a couple of years ago. I told my psychiatrist everything that bothered me and I don't think she understood me completely and then she prescribed me antidepressants. I felt pretty embarassed that I had told someone everything and they treated it like they were just ""teenager"" issues. I took medication for about a year and it was horrible as I became pretty dull and didn't really feel any emotions. I don't wanna go through that again."
depressed,ffiqx89,t1_ffimldw,1579980484.0,What?
depressed,ffiqs7r,t1_ffingx2,1579980386.0,"I thought about it, but idk it feels kinda weird. And i would just feel like using up their time. Besides, i need some sort of constant help and I can't just keep calling. And that's why I always avoid telling others, because I know I'm wasting their time. Not that I would have anyone to share my problems with anyway"
depressed,ffilj7o,t1_ffiiaom,1579976756.0,Don't really have anyine to talk to
depressed,ffidkw5,t1_ffic2as,1579971331.0,"I'm happy 2 hours a week during my guitar rehearsals. And I wish I wasn't happy even those 2 hours, because after they're done I become miserable again. It would be easier to just be sad all the time"
depressed,ffibn5n,t1_ffiae8k,1579970016.0,"Yes, it is. It is far more inhumane to be living in constant pain rather than to just end it all."
depressed,ffhnc26,t1_ffhmc6i,1579943659.0,It's next to impossible to do that when you have severe social anxiety
Guitar,ffg92yb,t1_ffg7s28,1579901100.0,"I don't think the name is correct, as your chord doesn't contain a Db. Anyway, I don't have my guitar on me at the moment, but from what I'm seeing that chord would sound pretty unpleasant, as it contains E, F and an F#, which are a semitone apart, causing them to sound very dissonant"
Guitar,ffg6pcn,t3_etghif,1579899629.0,"If your guitar is in standard tuning, aren't the notes you are playing E B F G B F#?"
depressed,ffbn7dr,t1_ffbn4no,1579773798.0,"I know this platform is good for venting, but still, I really miss the company of someone I can share my problems face to face with and who could just give a hug or a shoulder to cry on"
depressed,fev8qv7,t1_fesdw1r,1579394443.0,"I know comparison is bad and I try not do it, but sometimes it's just impossible. I get so jealous of others, and I can't help but feel like a complete failure, for being so socially awkward amongst others. Sometimes I just wish i could be like them and get rid of all this overthinking."
depressed,feqhoy3,t1_feq9izu,1579342063.0,Thank you. It really means a lot that you took your time to write this. I really appreciate it!
