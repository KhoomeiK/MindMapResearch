relationship_advice,ev430wn,t3_ci1p3j,1564206733.0,"Honey, I had this issue with my husband of 22 years this passed July 7th. I FINALLY got the nerve to tell him that I work 24/7 with no weekends off, and I don't get to put in my 40 hours and that's it. I told him that if he limed having me and the kids around, he'd watch OUR children for a few hours so I could have some ME time. I made it a point to tell him that I had no problem leaving him and taking my kidds with me if he felt that HE needs to have ""time off"" and that I'd have my family look after them so I could have some time to let my hair down and breathe. He realized just how much it would suck to come home from work and have to cook his own meals, do his own laundry, clean, and not have me around to do it all or have the kids to love on and play with when he felt like it. Girl, you have to stand up to him about this. Surely he gets that since you do everything anyway, you and the kids can survive if he's not there. I have been a SAHM for 12 years. The minute I put my foot down, and said something, my husband watches the kids no matter when I need a break. He works 60 + hours a week! So be strong, be firm. Have him take one day, even just 4-5 hours of a day and follow you around and do everything you do. He won't get thru the first 30 minutes. Once he sees how much work you do with no clock out time, you will get your ""me"" time. I am not trying to sound rude, disrespectful to my husband, or have you disrespect yours. But, if he respects you as a wife, and as a mother of his children, he will start helping out more at home. Marriage and parenting is 50/50. You both work.

Sevveral of the many times I went through withdrawal, I would have to go to the ER to get IV fluids because I was EXTREMELY dehydrated from the vomiting and diarrhea. Evvery time that happened, they would get my bloodwork back and my potassium was always critically low, and I had sinus tachycardia, which is a heart rate over 100 bpm (mine was 135 bpm). They'd give me IV potassium, and potassium pills at the same time. Just be careful please. I know they say withdrawal can't kill you, but when your potassium is so low that your heart starts palpitating and racing........the heart can only take so much before it says ""fuck this"".

It took away 90% of those horrible symptoms, and now I feel wonderful! I can function again and not worry about making that next pain management appointment so I don't run out of my pain meds. I go now just because they do my facet block injections, which I'm canceling my next one because, with Kratom, I don't need it.

kratom,eu3wctg,t3_cekwvp,1563427749.0,"My thoughts are this:

I believe that Kratom has more to do with that percentage than the government regulations do. Kratom use has gone up considerably because the government has made it nearly impossible to receive adequate pain control unless you are terminally ill. So, between needing relief from pain and avoiding going thru withdrawal, people have started taking Kratom. Kratom has changed my life for the better, as it has done for so many other people. IMO, the only reason the government wants to regulate Kratom so much is all about money, and control. It's sad, but true. For me, Kratom is nothing short of a life saver. I was well on my way to dying from the amount of pain meds I was taking just to get relief from my kidney disease and the agonizing pain it causes. I haven't touched a pain pill in 2 months thanks to Kratom. I haven't needed, or even wanted to. In February, I had pneumonia. From the amount of pain meds I was taking combined with the pneumonia, my respiratory system started shutting down. I ended up spending 5 days in the hospital because my oxygen saturation was 75%. Anything below 80% begins to do permanent damage to the brain. That was my reality check. I was shaking uncontrollably, couldn't control my muscles, and don't remember most of the trip to the ER. Anyway, I didn't mean to go into all that. I just get frustrated when the government takes so much credit for things like this. Between people having knowledge about and access to Kratom, and the fact that you can buy Narcan at Walmart WITHOUT a prescription for $60, I believe those are the reasons the death rate by opioid overdose have decreased. Not because the government has made it more difficult to get them."
kratom,eu0sfgn,t3_ce1noe,1563354136.0,"I, as a person who depended on pain medication for nearly 10 years, want to let you know that I admire how you fought to help your ex get off of pain medication. I was, at one point, taking 310 pain pills a month. At first, it was Norco, then Percocet, then Dilaudid, then all three together, then Morphine ER and Dilaudid (hydromorphone) together. I tried multiple times to quit, but could never get through the acute withdrawal phase without relapsing just so I could function. Then, a paramedic/friend told me about Kratom. I tried it, and it has been 2 months since I have taken pain meds at all. I don't even crave them. For years, I had no emotions at all. I would go through every day like a zombie. Now, I laugh, I smile, I give a damn. It took some getting used to having emotions again. Ones I hadn't felt in years. My husband and our kids didn't have the best version of me for a very long time. He stuck with me when most would not have thought twice about whether to stay or go. I applaud your willingness to stick it out. That's hard to do. I am so sorry that you went through so much. It's so wonderful that you have your mom back though. I am 40, and wish I had known about Kratom much sooner. I can't get back the years I threw away for my addiction. But, I can make sure my and my family's future is 110% better, and actually show up for life instead of just going through the motions to survive. Thank you for sharing your story!"

If I had to choose between being addicted to Kratom, or a man-made substance, I'm chosing Kratom. At least with Kratom, I can function, I have emotions, I feel, etc."
kratom,etx7ij4,t3_cdwcal,1563293263.0,That's great to hear! We are all here to support. That's why this is my fav place for Kratom advice. You are doing great! Keep sharing your progress üòÅ
kratom,etshdk3,t1_ets5ya1,1563145648.0,"I, myself, prefer capsules because I can take them anywhere I go. T&W made me puke (didn't do it fast enough, lol). I buy my powder from my favorite head shop. I buy empty capsules online and fill my own. It's cheaper, and I get way more. It's really a personal preference."
kratom,etlcdq7,t3_cc94ty,1562931740.0,"Please, stay away from the K. You're on the downhill side of the symptoms, and have come so far. Don't risk putting yourself thru it again. Can you go to a head shop and get some Kratom to get you thru these next few days? You can get thru it. I don't know you, but I have faith in anyone who has made it this far into withdrawal without giving in. I have been there more times than I care to think about. This last time, I told myself that there's no way I am putting my body thru it again. Get some Gatorade and Pedialyte to replace the electrolytes you've lost from the diarrhea, and get some form of potassium as that level drops when you lose fluids, and can cause muscle cramps, among other things. Good luck my friend."
kratom,etigg2u,t1_et6bam7,1562849296.0,"Just an update on the bp thing. Monday I had to call 911 and go to the ER because I was home alone with my 3 kids while hubby was at work, and my bp was 195/132, and my pulse was in the 130's. Long story short, I am now taking bp medication, and medication to slow down my heart rate. I checked my bp yesterday at lunch and it was 114/75! I was so happy to see those numbers. I still take kratom. I am scared to stop because I don't want to experience the hell of withdrawal (I have gone thru that waaaaaay too many times). This is the longest I have ever gone without pain meds. Kratom is the reason I can now function like I did before pain meds. I have emotions again (some of which were scary because I hadn't felt them in so long, I forgot what they felt like). My energy level is almost back to normal. I am more motivated now than I have been in years. Anyway, I just wanted to give you a follow up, and thank you for your advice üòÅ I don't think people realize just how much they help others when they respond sincerely the way you responded to me. So, thank you!"
kratom,etifhak,t3_ca64ob,1562848533.0,"Just a follow up on the whole bp thing. Monday, my bp spiked to 195/132. I called 911 and went to the ER. They got me straightened out. I also went to my doctor, and she put me on bp medication. Out of curiosity, I checked my bp at lunchtime yesterday, and it was 114/75! I was so happy to see those numbers! I am still taking my normal kratom dose. Thank you all for your advice. I am glad I went to the ER because not only was my bp high, my heartrate was in the 130's. They had to give me medication to slow that down, and lower my bp. My potassium was low, so they gave me that thru IV (which burns like crazy) and in pill form. It was a scary few hours, but I am so thankful to everyone here for the advice. I have never had high bp before, and wasn't sure what was causing it. Now I am not scared every time I take my kratom. I hope everyone is doing well! Have a great day."
Opiatewithdrawal,etie0ic,t3_cbpx97,1562847307.0,"I was taking morphine ER for a long time for pain associated with Kidney disease. I didn't want to be dependent on them anymore, so I decided to go CT. A friend/paramedic told me about Kratom, and how it took 90% of the withdrawal away, even after years of opiate use. I went to my local head shop and bought some, and can say that I haven't had any pain meds in almost 2 months. I haven't craved them, or needed them. It is up to you if you want to give that a try. I have read many success stories from folks who have used kratom to end the vicious cycle of dependency/addiction. Good luck to you. You've got this."
kratom,etauxk3,t3_ca64ob,1562629827.0,"I am at the ER right now. My bp was 196/135. They are blaming the kratom, but I am not convinced. They gave me ativan, and it went down. They know I have anxiety, so whats the problem? As soon as kratom was mentioned......it was an immediate attack."

kratom,et984s1,t1_et6im5e,1562589398.0,"I have never had high bp in the past. I have taken kratom before and it didn't do this. So, I am wondering if it's my body's way of responding to no pain meds (I took them for years). I started using Kratom when I stopped taking them over a month ago. My pain is controlled now, but this bp thing is troubling."
kratom,et6bu7s,t3_ca64ob,1562509171.0,"I asked the same question. I, too, have experienced high bp lately and I have been taking Kratom for a little over a month. My highest was 173/125! That's TOO high. I was wondering which Kratom is less likely to make my bp go up. I will be checking back periodically to see the responses to your question."

kratom,et6arcu,t1_et64sis,1562508449.0,"I thought about it being something else,  because the last time I took Kratom this long, it didn't do this. I drink diet coke, so not as bad as energy drinks, but still has caffeine in it."

The nurse practitioner had never heard of it, accused me of using meth (I wouldn't know what meth was if you handed it to me), and asked me where I buy it. I got angry with her and told her it's perfectly legal here, and she can buy it at any head shop in the area. Lack of education on her part does not constitute an emergency on mine. I made sure she knows that I will not stop taking it because she's an idiot and thinks it's meth. I told my PCP and she laughed and said, ""You do look like the everyday meth user"" (sarcasm of course). If it's legal in your state, don't worry about it showing up on a drug test."
