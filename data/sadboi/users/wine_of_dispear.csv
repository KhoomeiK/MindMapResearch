AskRedditNSFW,fhyuobp,t3_f5bxge,1581984183.0,"Not hoarding my belongings. 

I come from a family of very poor hoarders, trashy, messy, dirty people. It was all I knew. The items I had were MINE. I worked for them and who knew it I'd ever be able to afford another item like that ever again.

Then I met my (now) ex. He was very minimalistic in an extreme manner. No social media, hardly any belongings minus the necessities. I had so much crap with me, things that a normal person would have thrown away  YEARS beforehand. Over time I began throwing away and donating things. I became less possessive, less irritable due to less cleaning (less items means less to put away at the end of the night), and learned that physical items will NOT bring me happiness. 

It's such a wonderful feeling. The last time I moved I had 4 bags of items that belonged to me, mainly clothing and bathroom essentials. I made a complete 180 because of him. I clean every day (give or take a lazy day here and there), i don't buy unnecessary knickknacks or clothing, I don't have to worry when a friend visits because my home is clean and uncluttered. 

I'll always have him to thank for that little push."

I met someone recently,  we've been working together for almost a year so the feelings were shoved down and ""tried"" to be forgotten. We were both going through huge breakups, bad abusive relationships on both parts. We helped each other through the situations over time and neither of us want a repeat for either of us. We talked about all of the nitty gritty parts of our past relationships, those things molded us into the people we are. The way we see it, if we are both aware of the bad stuff and we actually WANT to be with the other person, we'll both actively work towards compromises. It's a group effort.

Step 3: hide the fact that you know all of this for an entire week because Christmas is right around the corner and nothing but shit ever befalls you. You need any bit of happiness you can get.

Step 4: watch him sleep. 

Step 5: give in and confront him on Christmas day  because how much worse can your life really get. 

Step 6: listen to him give excuses that you fully believe. He fully believes he's a sociopath, he doesn't want to fuck those other women, he just enjoys toying with their emotions. Playing games with their minds. Leading them on to fill that sickly dark hole in his chest.

Step 7: you're a masochist and a naive being so you stay with him, teach yourself to have rough, desperate sex in an attempt to fix everything. 

Step 8: wonder for the rest of your life if your brand new bike and brand new coat were stolen or if the sociopath gave them to some homeless person in an attempt to trap you."
