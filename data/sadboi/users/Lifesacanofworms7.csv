Maybe that will help. If you have clear skin you are blessed. I had cystic acne for years and I felt uglier than anyone cause no acne cream or medicine or anything was fixing the shit all over my face talk about a self esteem killer.

Christian,fmez51u,t1_fme7slu,1586016648.0,"I mean I know-all these things you guys are explaining. I've had this same thing taught to me my entire life, but it doesn't feel good enough. I know God is sovereign and can do what he wants, but none of it seems right. 

I heard about a pastor in France who refused to have people stay home from church and the people all started getting sick. I don't understand why God would allow his people to get sick and not gather when they are trying to do what he said gather in his name. Why isn't he protecting them from the virus. 

It makes no sense for children to have to suffer for sins of other people. If God is better than us and we wouldn't wish some of this stuff on some of our own enemies then why does God allow it? He even says that himself. He says if we being evil know how to give good things then how much more can he do that...
 Then as we know people don't even go to heaven when they die. They wait for God to come back because no one has actually been to heaven at all yet. It's just the Holy Spirit infilling is so real and I can't explain it at all other than it's real, but not much else in this faith makes sense to me. God does not seem present like he did in the Bible days. 
 

I get frustrated because it feels like there is always an excuse or explanation made for everything that happens. People get murder in the worst way possible oh sin did it. If something good happens oh God did it. If something good happens but it leads to something bad oh the devil an give blessings too. Always an excuse for everything. I just want to see God really moving in the bible like people say he does. I want to actually see miracles instead of people making things up and putting God's name on it. I feel like so much of this religion is people making things up to fit their agenda. It's hard for me because  a a scientist with faith. I have my degree in biochemistry yet I've been born again since 14. 

As for my aunt she was very close with God. She was always in prayer had a whole group of prayer warriors pray for her. She was always trying to give to others. She was in her Bible 24/7. She had declared she was healed by God and they found no cancer in her body. She was telling everyone her testimony how God healed her. I really did believe it because the doctors couldn't find any cancer. Then a year later cancer came back and killed her. She was also a born again. How does God get any glory out of something like that? How does he get glory out of other people seeing that she was not healed by him.

Maybe im just too carnally minded to understand I don't know. I also have extreme depression which I take medication for, idk. This whole life seems like a punishment far beyond cruel. The entire world being punished for two people's sins makes no sense."

The support system I need is not there. The court was not helpful. They hardly cared. The police system was not helpful. And financially we are struggling. The problem is my son will be worse off without his father possibly. We were going to get evicted from the apartment just because we didn't have him the apartment didn't care about domestic violence. The fact that I told them I was struggling made them threaten eviction more. I payed the rent with my savings but they now want proof of income. They said if all I have is savings and cash and no job because I just got fired they want me to show I have at least 9,000 in savings. The domestic violence line gives dead leads. The shelters are all full and give run arounds. I can't keep a 3 month old in a car and homeless. I can't get my job back even if I do the apartment wants me to make $2400 a month on my own to stay. My family absolutely refuses to help. The domestic violence and counselors just say u don't deserve to be hit your relationship is bad don't kill yourself but when I tell them I'll be homeless with a 3 month old or my son will have to go to Foster care because I can't support him or that the hospital that wouldnt release me for suicide got me fired. All they say is I'm so sorry to hear that. It's stupid. And the judge didnt even grant a protective order for the baby anyway just me so not like it matters because his father would still have access to him anyway. The judge wouldn't grant it because he hasn't hit the baby. He said refusal to feed or change isn't abuse lol. Dude the whole system in this country is fucking stupid. If my son would just have to go back to his dad anyway what's the

But yeah the pressure to feel like you have to be animated and the life of the party when you are around people to get anywhere in life is real. That's my struggle at work always. I just got a new job in an introvert driven field but the people I work with are nice but kind of basic. Obsessions with sports, peppy and perky laughing throughout the day often, talking about drama/gossip, very into group gathering especially at lunch. 

In contrast I have to work really hard to feel comfortable in that environment. My voice is monotone, I'm usually kind of tired most of the time, I struggle with bad depression and haven't had the best circumstances all my life so when I respond or talk to other people my responses can be really negative and depressing without trying to be."

medlabprofessionals,fgfkxcl,t1_fg9z8ve,1580741514.0,I'm just processing samples right now since I'm new. I don't get to interpret scatter plots yet. They said eventually they hope to teach me. I have serious newbie status I've only been there 7 days so far. Processing is a lot on it's own. With the tissues we have to chop them up in a media wash and centrifuge and resuspend with media to get cells to about 6000 wbc/ ul concentration. Then we proceed to add markers and prep for flow. I struggle with getting the tissues to the correct concentration. Depending on what your tissue samples look like the process is different. Too bloody you have to do multiple washes etc etc. Large samples use less media don't add original media. If it's a tiny core it's processed different as well because it's tiny so u have to use all the original media. You also have to make sure to filter at certain points so u don't get tissue cells in the analyzer and plug the probe. I get confused because of the different sample types and you kinda have to just look at it and decide for yourself the best way to handle each tissue specimen.

medlabprofessionals,fg7ducs,t1_fg6twle,1580590104.0,"I am a ""procedure person"". Like I said I really like my job and the company so far, but they have a lot of updating to do to their sop and the sops aren't very good or organized or even used very often. They kind of just memorize what u do and u use quick sheet sops every now and again which also need to be revised. They said they realized it needs to be revised while training me cause everyone has been there for years lol. 

I used to be a CLA for blood bank and the procedures are no where near as organized. I definitely like the structure of blood bank but I also like the more relaxed environment in the molecular lab. 

We use a Navios flow Cytometer, we use an AC-T automated call counter like in heme... We use an automated system to add markers to cells I forgot what that equipment is called though. Most people don't have flow experience because flow equipment is too expensive for most labs. It is my first CLS job. I literally just went online and applied for the job. It only took 5 years :/ to finally get any kind of CLS job. My interview was basic just same interview questions regular interviewers ask. They liked me and my resume and I told some jokes lol. I have a degree in biochem, a lot of research experience, an internship I did at Lawrence berkeley national lab, a reference from there, a co-authored research paper, and a license as a pharmacy tech haha, oh and my mlt program ALMOST complete I'm still in school for that. It still took me 5 years to get any kind of science job.

One batch of samples takes about 2 hours to prep to run. That's if you are experienced and fast.we did a batch of four samples the other day and it took 6 hours -___-. We do bone marrow, tissues, peripheral blood, and body fluid analysis. There are specific markers or stains we have to add for each disease we are trying to look for and different prep methods depending on the sample type and stain.  After running on the Cytometers we analyze the dot plot histograms and generate the reports for the pathologists to review. A busy day for us is like 40 samples because of how long they take to process. They also run FISH tests and cytogenetics and stuff too that I have to fill out the paperwork for and set up for them. I don't know much about FISH other than those people sit in the dark all day lol. 

I like flow so far because even though I am still struggling with tissues those are the most fun to do cause they are cool to look at, but micro is still my favorite department that and I love chemistry. 

They are thinking about adding PCR to my lab which I wish they would cause I like doing DNA extractions PCR and running gels. 

The biggest issue with flow and molecular in general is the sensitivity. Fibers clog the probe. Example, yesterday they decided we are over filtering the samples and may be introducing fibers instead of removing them. Even tiny amounts of cells from tissues can clog probes."

careeradvice,f9sb0qe,t1_f9s9467,1575588874.0,And yeah my point exactly. That's basically the only legit thing to go to school for rn. Other stem degrees are useless nowadays.
careeradvice,f9rztoh,t1_f9rukvr,1575583629.0,I wanted to be a scientist. And I work as a pharm tech. Can't stand pharmacy. Pharmacist wont have jobs in the future. I wish I went into software engineering. Engineers and programmers seem like the only good jobs now.
careeradvice,f9rom6f,t1_f9rogrk,1575579157.0,I am in school though had to go back for medical technology certification. College seems like a waste of time and money.
careeradvice,f9rogrk,t3_e6ig1a,1575579099.0,IDK I've been underemployed for 5 years since graduation from ASU with a B.S. in biochemistry. And now I have a baby I'd say I feel pretty much like a failure.
depression,f932nge,t3_e3ci2k,1575048327.0,"I am extremely depressed. I have a kid too now and I definitely think I'm a narcissist. Maybe not everyone with depression is, but I think I am. Seems like everyone else can be happy in their struggles or just deal with adulting while I whine and complain and drenof killing myself everyday for things other people would say are just apart of life. Only extreme selfishness could make me this way, has to be. I have a baby and he's cute and all, but all I can think about is how much I want my own life back and blah blah blah I don't want to deal with other people. I'm extremely selfish as a depressed person so I can't help thinking selfishness makes u slightly depressed."
PharmacyTechnician,f771scp,t3_duh6rp,1573441606.0,"No it's pretty much on the job. And every place Ive worked at told me it's usually the first one when you put in the bin so I'd just pick the first one that pops up. Then enter the rest of the info and try to process the claim. Rx cards usually have bin, pcn, Rx group or group and Id #, medical usually just have id # or Id # and group except for anthem BCBS they are weird. Some insurances there is just one card for both medical and Rx other insurances there are 2 separate cards. And you're really gonna have to just keep trying to figure out how to run claims and do overrides by doing it and observing."

Anxiety,f6owcl3,t3_dsccr1,1573038469.0,It's okay I got locked up twice at the hospital for suicidal thoughts. It sucks know how I feel.
depression,f6key64,t1_f6jufhz,1572911223.0,I would never kill my son. I love him. He's my sweet baby and he's 6.2lbs already and I am 8 months pregnant. He's due very soon. I can't wait to see his little smile and hold him.
PharmacyTechnician,f6k6n31,t3_drj5qo,1572906131.0,"You seem to be getting reviews from overly positive commenters. Let me be honest. LTC is supposed to be where techs go for relief from retail so you're technically downgrading. Also, if your store has a drive through and you're new you might be stuck at drive through your entire shift. I used to take chamomile pills like 2100mg a day to deal with pharmacy stress and all the multitasking and fast pace and I have diagnosed SAD and generalized anxiety disorder.  The people weren't really my issue because every interaction feels similar and robotic say the same thing and smile and be polite. That part is easy. It's just all the multitasking and pace of the work load from being short staffed that's bad. Your expected to do the work of like 3 people for close to minimum wage pay. I got tired of the repetitiveness. A lot of people don't love being a retail pharmacy tech and are not doing it as a career, but using it as a source of income or experience while they work on moving on to bigger and better things. Usually lifers or people that work off the clock and are surprised that the corporate monster doesn't give them a raise or promotion after taking on multiple responsibilities and acting overly enthusiastic about a low wage mediocre job are the types that say they actually like this job. I get a lot of hate on this sub, but I don't glamorize low paying jobs. 50k and less bs  like the boomers had and maybe I'll start treating my job like it's worth all the time I spent in school."
depression,f6jua9f,t1_f6jp4e2,1572900318.0,"Stupidity, it was an accidental pregnancy. I love the little smoochums, but I did not mean to get pregnant. I haven't gotten pregnant for 5 years so I thought I couldn't get pregnant. I had actually recently seen a Dr a few times to get birth control once I finally got health insurance. They ended up forgetting to call it in multiple times. The day I was going to call them again and tell them to call it in I found out I was pregnant."
depression,f6jciy0,t3_drhhtp,1572892590.0,I agree I don't think you want to die either. Just maybe not the life you have now. Who knows if what's on the other side is better or worse though.
depression,f69qdw9,t3_dqn20c,1572745598.0,Yup I feel like how can I tell if I'm just unhappy because my situations and not actually medically having an issue. I feel like I should be able to just be normal but literally I just think of killing myself everyday.
depression,f60ion4,t3_dq3v1t,1572618247.0,Tell them you don't have one right now. Or make up some random name and number so they'll leave u alone. Just tell them that your family passed and it's hard for you to talk about it. Sorry to hear this is happening to you.
depression,f60ij36,t3_dq43dk,1572618138.0,This one is rough. This is how I've been feeling about myself lately. I'm pregnant and gained a lot of weight. I have acne scars I tried to sand down and get rid of but made them worse. And I damages my hair with bleach (bad but not terrible) so I'm frustrated with my appearance too. Not sure what to tell u but keep working on u ig or like maybe just start saying the opposite out loud. Tell yourself your not ugly.
depression,f60i8i0,t3_dq3wcj,1572617925.0,I know the feeling so well. Rn I'm pregnant so I'm just doing door dash and Postmates until I deliver but soon I got to get a full-time again and have to postpone my certification until I find a way to make sure my baby has supervision. I've been stuck in call center hell and pharmacy jobs 4 years after I got my degree in Biochemistry talk about feeling pretty down cause I haven't been able to work in a lab yet.  My fiance has been working a an automotive job getting paid minimum wage when he is highly skilled. Trust me keep looking for what u really want to do and working toward that. Save money also try to find a side hustle so u can break free of wage slavery. Anything is better than a dead end job forever. Best wishes.

depression,f5yt4w0,t1_f5wrwdr,1572561287.0,"U guys must be extroverts with dysthymia then. I am actually working on the getting along with people part with my counselor. We talked about values. Being part of a group is not truly my value. I feel nothing towards other people. However my counselor brought up having good mental health is my value so socializing is part of that even if I feel like I gain absolutely nothing from socializing. But yeah I'm the same as you all an overachiever that tries hard the only thing is I don't do well in a work setting. I have often been a loner. I have angry outbursts when I'm fed up with people. Idk it is very shitty to be able to function well with depression. I feel like if I completely fell to shit someone somewhere would help me. I am on Zoloft and so far I haven't felt better but it's only been like 2 weeks. Even on the Zoloft I suck at people and job hop because I can't get along with people and am socially awkward. I was diagnosed with dysthymia, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive compulsive personality disorder ( like perfectionism)."
depression,f5yr0sv,t1_f5wrddx,1572560461.0,What's the difference between that and dysthymia? Because that's what I was diagnosed with and this sounds like me also except I struggle to get along with people.
