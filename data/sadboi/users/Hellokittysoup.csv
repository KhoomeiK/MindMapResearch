corvallis,foyvbx0,t3_gaacoz,1588179847.0,"If you can establish care with willamette vet, Dan leur is such a good option. Yeah it’s spendy, i think it’s 70 bucks for the initial visit but he’s really good. He will be honest with you about care I.e he will tell you if it’s worth it. And he will also be up front about his methods of anesthesia use and actual protocols that’s they use for rabbit care. They make themselves available to you 24/7 so if your rabbit goes into GI stasis they try to help you out. I have also been to Albany animal hospital with dr. Ken. He is super down to earth and just a good guy. I felt comfortable with him and didn’t want to change because he knew his shit too. If you are looking for spay/neuter options I recommend that you leave corvallis for that there are rabbit savvy vets in Portland that are able to coach you on ways to help pre op and post op and it won’t cost thousands. I mean if you have the funds by all means stay in the valley but it will be $700+  whereas Portland is like 300 (that’s where all the sanctuaries end up going to, they also coach you on how to prevent gi stasis)"

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fm2sar3,t1_fm2q4mr,1585704265.0,"Sure, it’s actually a very complicated multifactorial issue for both atypical antipsychotics and SSRIs. When we treat patients with depression we are talking about controlling neurochemicals and we are messing with a lot of the neurohormones that stimulate things such as appetite, metabolism, gut function and fat tissue energy storage (to name a few). So in short, there’s not a single thing that we can say, “yes this is what is causing 10+ lb weight gain.” Yes we can try to help patients by putting them on a strict diet and exercise plan but other times we have to select drugs that are more selective than the drug that caused the weight gain in the first place OR we select a drug that works in a very different way. With SSRIs there are studies that suggest that it could be due to its anticholinergic effects which stimulate appetite but again they believe there are other factors that lead to weight gain. So if you show up and you happen to have a high BMI we have to take that into account if we want to place you on a certain medication."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fm2ka9p,t1_fm2k3k3,1585699198.0,"Yeah, we change patients if they experience this. I think people don’t believe it when I say that exercise and diet DO NOT help when you are on certain meds. The only solution is to switch meds."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fm2hzgt,t1_fm2hhke,1585697859.0,"Hmmm that is super great for you and I’m glad you found something that helped. But we always tell our patients that weight gain can occur with many SSRIs as well as atypical antipsychotics. The weight gain varies in every individual and sometimes exercise isn’t going to help as well as diet. This is one of the reasons why many patients quit taking their meds. I appreciate that you responded to this, and again I’m glad you found the right medication."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fm2heoc,t1_fm2haap,1585697528.0,Yeah I’m just saying this body shaming sucks especially  if you’ve ever experienced weight gain because of a drug. 🤷🏾‍♀️
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fm2gy0f,t3_fsn279,1585697263.0,Hmmm anybody thought about the fact that this might be a drug related weight gain? Like maybe an antidepressant? Or atypical antipsychotic?

PharmacySchool,flvx698,t3_frhc1b,1585534227.0,"Be flexible. If you don’t know the answer to something look it up. When working up a patient try to think about possible questions that your pharmacists may ask you and be ready to answer them. Many times they may ask you about mechanisms of drugs that you may not know about because you haven’t gone over them as a p1 and it’s okay to say that you don’t recall but that you will look it up. As in community pharmacy your techs are the bread and butter of your work flow. Be comfortable asking questions about how to do something. If you are unsure, ask! Also be comfortable when talking to nurses, they know all about the patient and they can help a lot when you are on the floor. Know how comfortable your pharmacist is with you answering questions. Don’t make the mistake of answering a question on the floor for a nurse a physician, defer to your RPh (unless they instruct you otherwise). Have fun, welcome challenges. And finally remember you are helping in whatever capacity they need you to fill so you’re not too good to help with tech duties. Pay your dues, show them you’re a team player."
