Be I personally home school so I don't care today I understand you're probably just trying to get parents prepared and they just don't want to even think about the possibility. there's a lot of parents who needs school to be daycare for their kids but unfortunately there's also a lot of just crappy parents who want the schools to raise their children and don't want anything to do with them I've seen some extremely cruel things said about children lately by their parents.
