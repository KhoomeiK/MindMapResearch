As someone who suffers from mental illness my whole life, I have a great deal of sympathy for others who suffer from the same pain.  We are all responsible for our own mental health, and it sounds like she needs to get hers under control. I'm not saying you stay in contact with her, but I do ask that you have some understanding that she is sick and often cannot control her actions. Please do not hurt her, just get away from her. I think it will take time for you to understand what I'm saying here, and that's ok. Life is chaos and often unfair.  She is sick and so are you.
