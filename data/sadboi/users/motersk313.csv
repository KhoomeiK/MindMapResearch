Anxiety,fptaw4e,t1_fptaamg,1588887929.0,"I'm so happy to hear that :). Yesterday I heard someone say how love is the feeling of oneness, of feeling the similarities between each other and the dissolving of borders between us. Anxiety is the polar opposite in that we feel disconnected from others, we feel different and not alike, and alone in that way. I think what you just said was a beautiful example of getting closer and experiencing love, even though you anticipated anxiety."
Anxiety,fpta0ky,t1_fpra9wq,1588887485.0,"Let me know if you ever just wanna chat about death or any other topic. Sometimes having a bit of a conversation can also really open up things.

Anxiety,fpt95o4,t3_gf9j2x,1588887049.0,"This thing I want to suggest might be really scary, but it can have a real big payoff. All your co-workers have dealt with this feeling in the past, or still do, they all know how it feels. Connecting with them on a level will allow you to feel how you and them aren't that different, which you could argue to be the fix of most of the anxiety. When I had the feeling that things went really bad or could have gone so much better, I asked my supervisor or close colleague. Having a one-on-one conversation about how I felt about it and how he/she felt about it clears the cloudyness/unknown territory. It feels scary to not know where you stand and discussing that and clearing it up will bring you so much further. Respectable co-workers or bosses will have an eye for this, and they will respect you for coming to them for advice. We are all just walking each other home, even if it may not seem like it at times."

Psychonaut,fpobcps,t1_fpo9zh2,1588781609.0,"Thanks for the reply. I 100% stand behind that statement. There is nothing inherently wrong with anything going any particular way, everything is unfolding as it is. I have really learned to let go more and more of models and expectations bound to them. Where it still remains difficult at times is the gradient between expectation and anticipation. Anyhow, I'll do what I'll do, it's just another happening."
Psychonaut,fpoaige,t3_gcy3hq,1588781190.0,The analytic and intellectual mind or way of thinking is extremely overvalued in my opinion. Real happiness and contentment has for me always been an effect of the experience or emotion that occured.
