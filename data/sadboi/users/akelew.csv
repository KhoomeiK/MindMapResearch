> My mom lied to me about who my dad was until I was 15 years old and across the world. I had told her repeatedly that I knew that my stepdad wasn't my dad and both my mom and step dad told me to pay for a paternity test and that I'd see that I wasted my money. 

Seems pretty spiteful to me. Lieing like that. If she had such 'good reasons' to do it, why not just be honest and upfront?"

If she asks ""wow won't that be a lot to juggle?"" you could say nice and calmy ""What makes you think that?"", keep asking open ended questions trying to get her to dig the hole deeper and deeper to reveal her true intent. It gets harder and harder to maintain a line of passive aggressiveness the longer it gets dragged out. So drag it out in a way where she cant accuse you of anything. You were just asking her to expand on what she said! soo.. Then hopefully your husband will be able to see what her real line of thinking is."

You could always just hire a hitman...

I think i know what your getting at, and if so, i think your best option really is to have strong boundaries. You can't change their behaviour, when they meddle, control, or get in the way. You can't always make them understand their behaviour was wrong, or convince them that their 'intentions' don't matter when the end result is what is impacting you.

I would completely ignore their 'intentions' when discussing it with them. I would be very dismissive of the intentions, and just directly invoke the specific action that impacted you negatively, and then let them know what YOU will/will not be doing as a direct result of that action, and then simply carry through with it.

They will learn, or not. You can't really make them do anything, but you can establish with them that you don't care about what their intentions were, because you simply established consequences for their behaviours. If they don't like those consequences enough, they might change their behaviour."
