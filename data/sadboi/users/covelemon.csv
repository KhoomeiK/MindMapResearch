I'm contemplating divorce. We have 2 small kids and everything about the divorce process sounds so stressful and heartbreaking.

I love him but I have felt for years like we're two different puzzles pieces just trying to jam ourselves together. Something is not working. We fight so so so much and I'm just so exhausted from everything. I'm starting to shut down.. and I just want him out of the house so I don't have to deal with the arguing.

The thought of not being with him 10 years from now though sets me immediately into bawling. I just need a break, you know? We have tried therapy.. we should go back... but I'm just so tired.

We fight about chores, work, parenting styles, sometimes money, our extended family, sex (or lack thereof)... the list goes on.."

I have a history of self-harm so I can relate.

I figured I had nothing to lose at that point because I was so depressed. And guess what? They helped me!

I also tried to keep it secret from my husband because I didn't want to stress him out. We ended up getting in a huge fight one night because he wanted a family member to come over and help us with our child, but that family member was NOT a supportive person for me to be around. I ended up telling him everything that night-- that I am fragile, I am seeking help, and can only be around positive support systems right now. I  hindsight, I could have saved us a lot of confusion and stress if I just told him sooner.. and he started to understand me better and why I was acting the way that i was.
