I actually think that, given my personality, knowing about my narcissism may very well be a hindrance more than a help. It leads to obsessing, perseverating, and hyper-focusing on it. For one, while he tries not to show it, my therapist clearly seems tired of me talking in clinical terms...perhaps because I need to be invulnerable and be his equal in knowledge and insight, when that’s his job. In fact, I should really stop trolling the NPD and BPD subreddits because I go into hyper-analysis mode and then often spend/waste the entire therapy session trying to convince my therapist why I’m full-blown NPD, why this behavior or thought was narcissistic/grandiose, etc.

I definitely have a lot of empathy, but maybe it’s selective, I’m not sure. I constantly question myself, so now i’m even questioning whether in fact I do have true empathy or if it’s highly selective or deficient...but that could just be anxiety/OCD. But generally, if I see someone suffering, I feel really bad for them much of the time and often want to help to some degree. 

I also have severe identity issues, e.g. not having real values of my own, constantly playing Devil’s advocate and taking the other side of an argument because I don’t really know what I believe...switching business ideas or career ideas every other...and constantly questioning and doubting my life choices and why I do what I do and feeling disgusted with my choices and myself. I’m also extremely emotionally intense.

Where I’m narcissistic is the constant need to feel superior to others and regulate my self esteem to feel special. needing constant admiration, one of the diagnostic criteria of NPD. And feeling entitled to special treatment, but unlike people with true NPD, i generally don’t throw a hissy fit when i don’t get treated a certain way. My therapist says these tendencies can also come from my childhood, where I was criticized for my adhd and other annoying behaviors one minute and then 10 minutes later, I was told I could be president or whatever. I always felt specially treated as a kid. I was good looking, very smart, charismatic, etc. so maybe that’s why, but the constant mixed signals throughout childhood, adolescence, and now adulthood really did a number on me. I feel like I have to keep proving my specialness to people, which is probably in part what leads to those narcissistic rages."
NPD,fl4d146,t1_fl4come,1584810949.0,"Yeah, I too have multiple cluster B PD traits, but not any full PD (at least according to my PD-specialist therapist). It’s truly a mess. I don’t relate 100% to either people in the BPD subreddit or the NPD subreddit, or fully to descriptions or the required number of DSM criteria of either PD to qualify for a DX, either.

My therapist says that when I think I’m grandiose, it’s often not true grandiosity. But he does acknowledge I’m grandiose in thinking I know more than him sometimes or that he’s not good enough to treat me.

I relate to the False Self only a little bit, in that if someone says I’m not supremely attractive or the most amazing bowler, tennis player, etc., even though I  *know* this, it still really, really hurts and I’m tempted to lash out at them and can barely contain my rage. I hate narcissistic rage. I really hate it, but feel powerless to it. But I’m usually too scared to rage at them in person, so I’ll just pout about it at home or unleash a massive rage via text messag.e

But the difference between me and someone with full-blown NPD (at least according to my understanding) is that the person with NPD really buys into the False Self, at least most of the time, whereas I truly believe I’m not “enough” for people because i’m not perfect, and my “grandiose” states are EXTREMELY temporary and short-lived and the bubble is popped by the smallest perceived slight or rejection."
BPD,fl4cjq8,t1_fl4cajz,1584810662.0,"Well, in all fairness, my friends end up going for the jugular too, but usually because I take the argument to that place of visceral, terrible attacks. Maybe they also have narcissistic traits, but I doubt it.

And yes, as painful as it is for me to confront, these are likely narcissistic injuries. The thought is, “how dare you say that to me? I’m superior to you, you’re a POS.” Strangely, I can go back to liking and valuing them as friends after an argument. It also only happens majorly with very close friends rather than less-close friends. 

It is worth saying, though, that true narcissists (with NPD) do not forgive even after apologies. They want multiple apologies. Then again, I often do, too. 

I honestly hate my narcissism in most ways. But apparently it is a trait which cannot be “cured.” And honestly, I don’t think the insight, which I’ve had for at least 5 years, has helped much. I don’t engage quite as much in fights with people, but I lost a friend of 12 years (hopefully temporarily) last month because I escalated it as a result of feeling devalued and having “lost” and needing to win at any cost, even that of a 12 year friendship! Sick..."
BPD,fl4bsi3,t1_fl4bhrw,1584810211.0,"Yeah. I’d literally go on endless 50 text (or sometime even more, I think!) rants when a friend pushed my buttons or insulted me in a way that struck a nerve of one of my insecurities. They became my mortal enemy and I *HAD* to destroy them at any cost. If I didn’t, I lost and was worthless. When they apologized for their end of things, even if I apologized first (which was, sadly, more often than not the case), I’d mostly get over it and act like nothing happened, which surprised and caught them off guard, lol.

My therapist says this is a narcissistic way of relating to people. I have bpd and NPD traits, but not the full PD, supposedly. So I’m curious how someone with BPD and no pathological narcissistic traits would handle the same situation and view the friend in that argument."

BPD,fl490bd,t3_fm4x43,1584808537.0,"I relate to this tremendously. I notice I also play devil’s advocate, taking the other side when someone says something, for no apparent reason. I feel like I can always identify with both sides of an argument, if that makes any sense, probably because I hold no stable views or values of my own. honestly, I can’t even comprehend what “values” mean, since everything is dictated by other people. 

Even my feeling of being attracted to someone is subject to external influence. If I tell my friend, “oh, that person’s really hot,” and they disagree, I immediately devalue and lose most interest in them. My thinking is, well if so and so doesn’t think they’re attractive, they must not be. Same with me. If someone doesn’t appear to think I’m attractive, I feel worthless and totally unattractive.

I also am EXTREMELY chameleon-like. I act however I think the person or people I’m hanging out with want me to act, since I feel so fundamentally inadequate in some ways...yet I also feel superior and special at some deep level...it’s a total contradiction and insane.

In some ways, though, I think this lack of stability actually confers some advantages. In marketing, for example, you want to appeal to your customers. Being able to be flexible in how you market and take their perspectives can be helpful. Same in social or romantic situations...at least in the short term, till the people realize you’ve been fake with them and don’t like the real you. I’m sure there are other ways, as well."

1. How are we not economically capable? We have the largest economy in the world. I think we’re more politically incapable due to our decentralized government. And I think the pros of that outweigh the cons. States’ rights are built into our constitution from the beginning. China isn’t exactly a free place to live, and South Korea likely has its own significant issues, as well.

2. Now the biggest US cities are saying to stop testing mild cases. That’s a significant shift and indicates a more optimistic view, IMO, that the virus isn’t as severe for the vast majority of people as was once thought. That corresponds to China’s findings (as though it were news...) that most people recover quickly.

3. Whether or not those instructions/mandates actually improve survival rates is by no means a given.

Covert narcissism seems like it’s often “failed” grandiose narcissism. Grandiose narcissists often, though not always, have good social skills. They can essentially con others into believing their grandiose self-image. Covert narcissists, on the other hand, tend to use tactics like passive aggression, overly self effacing demeanors, etc., because they feel socially incompetent. Why else would one who fundamentally feels entitled and grandiose  revert to behaviors that totally contradict this deeply held belief?"

NPD,fkwa1uy,t1_fkvmkoi,1584587025.0,"Yeah, but I don’t understand why life is so painful, why my brain has to be such a fucking clusterfuck. I’m beyond tired of it. Not only do I have narcissistic traits, I also have BPD traits and some kind of bipolar, ocd, and adhd. I’m so sick of it. I’m sick of myself, my brain, and this world. It only ends when I’m dead, and that’s depressing. Life is almost never good. It’s just crap on top of crap on top of crap. I feel like I haven’t made any, or at least significant, progress in the 6 months I’ve been with this therapist, not to mention the other 6+ therapists I’ve had in my life, who’ve all diagnosed me with different things.

I watched Joker last night. I loved it. Joaquin Phoenix was sensational and truly deserved that Oscar. But beyond that, I honestly really related to him. I feel like I’ve been beat down my entire life and I’m just sick of it. Beat down by my brain, by the world that constantly punishes me for my mental illnesses, etc.

One can only take so much, especially with no hint of significant improvement.

And that’s part and parcel of personality disorders/pathology. The problem lies with US. Not with others. But we’re too fearful of change and of imperfection and of rejection and of not being good enough to accept it and to change. I’m a pussy, is what it comes down to. A pussy who wallows in self-pity, egotism, and fear."
BPD,fkvgzyw,t3_fkti67,1584569037.0,"I relate. I always feel like good looking people are cocky and full of themselves and unapproachable. While at some level, I know I’m good looking, I have a hard time truly believing it sometimes. I project a lot of my own narcissism onto others. 

I constantly look for validation and admiration of my looks in my environment. I get SO SICK of being so externally dependent on others to define my sense of worth and self-esteem but I feel helpless to change it.

I feel like I have multiple personalities. When I’m perfect me, everyone admires me, thinks I’m attractive. When I’m “nonexistent” depressed me, no one looks at me. I feel invisible, Like I don’t exist. It’s awful."

I’ve thrown adult temper tantrums before because someone was better looking or getting more attention. 

Still, my therapist maintains I’m not full NPD and these are just “defenses.” Hard to believe “defenses” can be this painful. I also relate bettter to Npd than bpd when I read the subreddits and descriptions in articles, dsm criteria, etc."
NPD,fk35y17,t3_ffvrc5,1583818904.0,"You sound extremely anxious. Perhaps you’re socially awkward and are somewhere on the autism spectrum. But I highly doubt you have NPD. I’d say 90% of people fantasize. And while I don’t presently have facts or research to back this up, I believe many insecure people fantasize about being great or perfect at the thing about which they’re insecure. Actually, avoidant personality disorder, closely linked with social anxiety, involves fantasy about being accepted as part of its diagnostic criteria...

First thing you need to do is stop trying to self diagnose and see a good therapist. Get a proper diagnosis from an objective professional. Once you have that, you’ll know more accurately what you’re really dealing with—not what your anxiety is telling you you’re dealing with—and how to proceed and/or treat it."
NPD,fk35gjd,t3_ffx29x,1583818400.0,"First of all, slow down and take a few deep breaths.

Have you actually been diagnosed with a personality disorder, or anything else? Have you even seen a mental health professional? Make sure you’re not self-diagnosing and see a good mental health professional, first and foremost.

Next, the way you write is highly emotional and unlike most people with true NPD. You may have traits, as I do, but quite likely not the full blown disorder.

Hating yourself, feeling remorse, feeling you don’t deserve to exist, these things seem much more like BPD than NPD. 

I actually could have written much of this and I relate very well. I also think I’m somewhere on the autism spectrum but subclinical and likely only a true ASD specialist would diagnose me with it.

All of these issues combined certainly make for a lonely and often miserable existence.

What I can offer now is to see a therapist ASAP and get a real sense of things from a more objective person who’s professionally trained in this area, and also to focus on doing something—anything—with your life. Our actions are all we can control.

Finally, I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. But like all emotionally highly charged states, remember: “this too shall pass.”"

BPD,fjaxscn,t1_fjax1oa,1583182642.0,"Totally agreed. The complexity and diversity in presentations of BPD is vastly oversimplified and misunderstood, IMO, in the DSM and among mental health community and lay people. I do not qualify for a full BPD diagnosis, apparently, because I don't have 5 of 9 criteria... maybe 3, 4, or 4.5, lol. I also have very significant vulnerable narcissistic traits. My psychologist calls them ""narcissistic defenses."" As a few examples, I freak out at the idea of not being perfect, of someone being better at something than me (generally something I can't change, like my looks or talents in a particular area), I get extremely jealous and upset when someone gets more attention than me, when I'm ignored, etc. I also have very high standards for myself, which I never meet, and have a significant sense of entitlement.

Vulnerable narcissism, by most research literature, doesn't overlap with or DSM NPD, but actually BPD. It's tough to say for sure, though, as with anything in psychology... a recent study, for example, concluded that men with BPD were more likely to have grandiose narcissism than VN. The sample size was quite low, though.

I would actually say VN is just as painful as BPD in many ways... constant unmet expectations for yourself and others, EXTREMELY self-critical, punitive self-talk, very low self-esteem, unmet entitled expectations, etc. It really sucks."

It's funny how you say ""obviously [you] felt offended"" in that situation, since I'm sure you know that most people without narcissistic traits wouldn't feel offended; they'd just think that he's in his own world, felt embarrassed or nervous, is a jerk, didn't see them, or just doesn't find them attractive, and they'd move on. Whereas we, with NPD or NPD traits, are left puzzled, angry, enraged, and/or panicking about our very identities (at least, the last part applies to me).

It's also interesting that you talk about going home and re-grooming yourself. Do you find that makes you feel better, as in you feel more attractive or do a ""reset"" when you fix yourself up? That doesn't make me feel better, because to me it is more fundamental; that is, it's about my facial attractiveness, of which of course I can't do anything to change the innate bone structure, proportions/ratios, etc. So essentially, I have to ""accept"" that that person just doesn't find me attractive. And even if 99 out of 100 people find me attractive, I'll OBSESS over that 1 person who doesn't find me attractive, desperately analyzing, intellectualizing, and feeling worthless because I'm not perfect.

I don't photograph very well due to acne and severe acne scarring. So everything feels like a lose-lose. Like life's backed me into a corner, an animal waiting to lash out at this cruel prison of a world I inhabit not originally of my own choice.

Just as further reassurance, if you can genuinely love and empathize with the folks you've harmed, unless it's purely self-referential or shame-based, you likely don't have full NPD. 

I also feel genuine guilt and empathy for those whom I've harmed. After my text rages toward a friend, I was extremely quick to apologize. But sometimes it was too late. I needed my power and control fix at the time and it cost me dearly. Also, a number of times, these rants were sent while drunk and irrational. Alcohol and BPD/NPD traits/bipolar probably don't mix well.

I've also sent extremely passive-aggressive texts to people who rejected me romantically, saying ""it's good you avoided me, I'm dangerous and fucked up"" just to remind them of the rejection and make them feel guiltier. It's pretty fucked up, but kinda morbidly funny, lol.

Do you also self-sabotage, BTW? I often sit at home or sleep in all day just to ""punish"" myself, even when another part of me wants to be out and about, doing fun or productive stuff, etc. It's very odd.

I was like, ""wow, this is who I am? A psycho murderer or something?"" I'm so torn and confused. My entire childhood, I was told I was compassionate, empathic, etc... and now I'm being told I'm a crazy stalking psycho. I've also literally wanted to kill someone when he rejected me very meanly after we hung out for hours and he kept trying to touch my dick through my pants ""jokingly"" (yeah, I'm gay). Talk about mixed signals. That's my entire life. I also ""wanted"" to (or at least had thoughts of) killing one of my best friends because he blocked me and had the last word. I can't STAND when other people get the last word. I've gotten into major road rage situations because I perceived someone cut me off or tried to show me up or race me intentionally (this is where the paranoia comes in, exacerbated by the narcissism). I've put my own life and the lives of others at risk MULTIPLE times. 

I feel like a total fuck-up, man. As someone in the BPD forum posted, I'm constantly waiting for life to start... I'm 30 and I feel like a baby in many ways. Not fully committed to my work, which is a VN symptom, too... I have a business that I could be growing to a big concern, and I just sit in my boxers most days and do nothing but browse the Internet.

BTW, emptiness is a huge BPD symptom too, and I experience it multiple times per day. My suicidal thoughts are typically triggered by interpersonal perceptions of rejection or abandonment but also by loneliness/general misery/hopelessness. It's worth noting, though, that I've never attempted suicide, even if I'm wrapped belts around my neck or made pathetically cowardly stabbing motions at my stomach multiple times out of pure rage and misery... along with throwing and destroying things a few times.

Also, I've only had one romantic relationship out of my paralyzing fear, history, and conviction of constant rejection, and how I need to be perfect and facing rejection will inevitably shatter that idea.

Funnily enough, I contradict myself, because I've insisted to multiple therapists, including my current one, that I have NPD, but when they finally admit I have narcissistic traits/""defenses"" (even though no NPD), I feel really upset and angry... it's so weird. It's like I want it, but I don't want it. And for the exact same reasons as you... NPD feels like a horrible disorder. Narcissists have a reputation for being manipulative, gas-lighting, cruel, liars, etc. Borderlines just seem like innocent ""victims"" of life.

If it makes you feel better, people with true NPD rarely feel ""badly"" about their disorder, from what I've seen. It is only the vulnerable narcissists that feel badly. And as I mentioned in the other thread, VN and BPD have a huge overlap. Here's a study about that: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29466803](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29466803)

FWIW, treatment of NPD and BPD are different. They're clustered and can be, and often are, comorbid, but whereas treatment for NPD addresses the pathological grandiose (""False"") Self, treatment for BPD is more focused on identity disturbance/integration, mindfulness, and emotional regulation."
NPD,fj7wp99,t1_fj7vzhz,1583099927.0,"I'm glad to find someone to whom I can relate. :) But I'm sorry you go through this too. It's not fun at all...

The scary af thing about integrating the two ""personalities"" (personas might be a better word?) is that it means fully accepting that I'm not perfect. In one state, I guard myself against rejection and imperfection. In the other, I'm convinced I'm worthless. I think the latter is almost my default state and the other persona takes over when I can't bear feeling that way anymore. I know no middle ground; it is too scary to actually accept and embrace me not feeling perfect. Does that resonate with you?

Some of my BPD/VN symptoms (sometimes hard to tell which is which):

* Mood and self-image/self-esteem are extremely reactive to the environment—if someone finds me attractive or if they don't...if I feel rejected, ignored, or invisible...or not
* Feeling some degree of specialness, arrogance, over-confidence, grandiosity, etc., but being afraid/inhibited and ashamed of feeling and expressing it
* Extreme sensitivity to perceived slights or insults, or being told someone else is better-looking or more talented than me
* Extreme and inappropriate anger. Sometimes I'm angry for hours or days, I guess mainly when my self-image/self-esteem is threatened
* History of lashing out at people when I fear abandonment or rejection...sometimes causing self-fulfilling prophecies
* Suicidal gestures and threats when I fear abandonment, but can never get myself to make real cuts in my skin
* Paranoia that people are trying to hurt me or bring me down, to the point of lashing out at random strangers sometimes...I find this is exacerbated by stimulant use

How do your BPD and vulnerable narcissism symptoms mainly manifest? I also want to clarify that vulnerable narcissism largely doesn't overlap with NPD. NPD correlates with the traditional, overt or grandiose form of narcissism. Vulnerable narcissism symptoms actually overlap very well with BPD."

So yeah, my life has always been an emotional roller coaster, but I also have some kind of bipolar spectrum disorder, which makes it hard to pinpoint the source of the mood shifts. But I know most of the same-day mood shifts are reactive/BPD/neuroticism related.

I feel like I’m headed nowhere most of the time. I’ve had no romantic relationships since my first one over 12 years ago. I mostly do it to myself because I’m so utterly convinced I’ll be rejected by anyone I like, even while in these superimposed “grandiose” states. And I fly into a panic/rage/self hatred spiral when I feel rejected, so there’s literally no winning. (I guess they must not be truly grandiose, after all. Just pathetic coping mechanisms.)

Vocationally, I basically hover between a freelancer and a “real” (but very small) business. I have just barely enough clients to scrape by. My entire life has been about scraping by, and I’m tired of it, but it seems that this is my destiny: one of mediocrity, misery, and loneliness, and narcissism/borderline traits affecting everything.

Splitting the self is common in both, except that my understanding is that typically someone with true narcissism splits themselves as all-good most of the time (a stabler sense of self), as the other fellow who replied here described, whereas people with BPD have a much more fluid/unstable self-image and split self or other more often. That stability in NPD is because of a False Self which BPD doesn’t have. That’s a major distinction.

I guess that means my narcissistic defenses are never fully lowered.

Have you seen a therapist for your challenges? This might be a better time than any.

Apparently my self image is more unstable than most people with npd according to my psychologist, but I do have significant NPD traits.
