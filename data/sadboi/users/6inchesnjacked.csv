Say that YES he looked objectively very attractive, but objectively AND subjectively, your husband is the most attractive man to you, you love him so dearly and there's nobody else in this world you want more.

Didn't know I was the bad guy there haha. Anyway, sucks your boyfriend is mindless. Thoughtful gifts are lovely, but I can only hope that he's a great partner outside of gifting because this doesn't seem like the end of the world. I think him trying to remedy it was a good sign.

Also my ex-gf of 3 years, it was so amazing to be able to actually be myself to somebody. Even after 3 years, we were still able to talk nonstop, she found my really goofy jokes hilarious.

About stuff like her bus not showing up on time, if I didn't call her for 2 hours per day, if I didn't text her back fast enough, among many other things. I think we literally fought every time we called each other and it's so silly that we didn't notice how fucking stupid it was at the time. Well, I did, which is why I always tried to tell her that we're stronger than this and it's such an unnecessary fight. Over time I was just drained and constantly walking on eggshells, terrified of what to say next because it could result in a fight. Eventually it becomes crippling to text her because through text, I can't tell if she's mad at me or not. If there are no emoji's, if she ends her sentences with a period, I started to see all of these things and question whether or not she was mad at me, because it seemed like she was more often than not.

I'm really glad I'm out of that relationship. I still find myself looking back at the good, but I'd never date her again and I'm definitely ridiculously picky right now. I haven't liked anybody for real since. So yeah, fights have the potential to affect men quite a bit."

Gave her only a hug goodbye but I don't recall any special feeling aside from feeling fondly about her. Second date I kissed her in public because in that exact second I felt like that was absolutely necessary, she was literally telling me when the bus was coming but sometimes you just know when the right time is. I think I just liked her at this point of course, but even then it wasn't a very discernable feeling. She told me she loved me after 3 months and I said it back, but that was because I felt guilty as she cried when she said it. Dated her for 3 years and then we broke up. I never felt more ""in love"" than when I said it to her for the first time, but I did do a lot of cute things for her because I always wanted her to be happy. My goal a lot of the time was to excite her, and I felt so, so excited whenever I did something I knew would excite her, but my heart never felt broken during the breakup. In hindsight, I think I was just so intensely attracted to her that the sex made it worth putting up with everything and making her happy.

In our relationship though, I never had doubts that she loved the absolute fuck out of me. She always, always wanted to be around me, talking to me, fucking me, etc. and that's mostly why we broke up.

When her bus was late, she had a tiny fuse and no matter how many eggshells I'd walk on she'd still find a way to snap on me. If that phone call ended she'd get mad at me later for not talking to her enough, she had no regard for my time. She'd get upset if we didn't have two hour phone calls every night, or if I couldn't make a family event her family hosted, the list goes on and on. With my newer ex girlfriend I found myself always thinking she was mad at me, like my other ex.

I still haven't figured out how to move past it. I get crippling anxiety from texting girls that I start seeing because I always feel like I'm not doing enough. It was so much more than simply putting effort into a relationship with my first ex, I had to give her my fucking soul and I honestly did not have a minute to myself because I was forced to text in a timely fashion.

It really fucking sucks. I assume you and I need to continue spending time with quality people until we learn to trust them. It's hard and unfair to them, because it's almost as if they need to be perfect to you for a long time before you can trust them, and if they slip up like humans do, it makes it harder to trust them and you backtrack a bit.

I don't consider myself to have a disorder. It is a fetish. It's simply insecurity if somebody can't handle the thought that something their s/o wants during sex is something that can be given by someone else.
sex,eqyntho,t1_eqymuyw,1560386391.0,"Yes it is, but honestly some girls man they just don't get it. My most recent ex sucked about it. I bought her a pair of lycra shorts at her request, we had sex a few times a day using them, she always came first and I'd finish after. Sex was great and then randomly she says she wants to compromise regarding our sex and the fetish. I didn't understand, as she'd put them on, we'd do some foreplay, she'd take them off and we'd have penetrative sex and it was always good."
sex,eqynhls,t1_eqymrxp,1560386236.0,"23 years. Aware since sometime in elementary school. It evolved in odd ways. Started off as girls wearing silky basketball shorts turning me on, and now it is any type of compression clothing."
sex,eqymp9f,t3_bzwyfv,1560385859.0,"Seems like she wouldn't know you're feeling that way based on the fact that you are having great sex for the past 6 months and longer. Maybe, I don't know, talk to her about how you aren't feeling desired and that you don't blame her at all, since it's not her fault at all as she probably doesn't know that you don't feel desired."
sex,eqym85q,t3_bzunn7,1560385640.0,"I said out loud ""You fucking retard"" (not you) when I read that he said ""this does nothing for me"".

Your boyfriend seems like an idiot."
cars,eqqg60j,t1_eqqfzpx,1560220225.0,Thank you. I feel better. I did look up a lot of videos on how to fix scratches and it looks very easy but I don't want to risk taking 3000-5000 grit sandpaper to this car. Don't trust myself haha.
cars,eqqfzi4,t1_eqqex6s,1560220105.0,"I'm definitely going to bring it up to them. My friend is going to use a paint pen on it, he says he can fix it like that so that's a start. If it covers, I won't tell them but if there's still scuffing I don't want to hide it."
cars,eqqfw1d,t1_eqqey66,1560220041.0,"It's a weird shape, it blends with the slight curve in the door if that makes sense. A little smaller than a foot. I took a photo and sent it to a mechanic friend and he said he can fix it with a paint pen for free. Not sure what that means, but I hope that works."
offmychest,eqkvezh,t3_bynr6n,1560131953.0,"The list you posted doesn't really seem all bad. Registering for classes is great because you get to pursue a career and you have the knowledge that the retail job is temporary. Logistics of visiting your girlfriend should be exciting, who doesn't like planning a trip to see a loved/liked one? Maybe I'm just being optimistic"
offmychest,eqkur0u,t3_bygnq4,1560131550.0,"I commonly make fun of people who wear shirts that say ""Don't talk to me until I've had my SECOND coffee"" or some shit like that. I usually do get headaches without a coffee in the morning, but it definitely isn't an excuse to be any less nice."
relationship_advice,eqet3or,t3_by80h0,1560009173.0,"Yeah, I'd probably wince if I saw you doing the crip walk but it's not worth mentioning, especially because people were vibing with it."
