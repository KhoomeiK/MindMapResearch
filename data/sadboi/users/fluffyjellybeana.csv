Buddhism,fpwvhm5,t3_gfqzye,1588970725.0,"I actually have heard a story of the Buddha who had this conversation with Ananda about a man who spit in his face. Upon looking it up, it appears it may be a story made up by Osho? Not sure if there is a scriptural basis. But it is a story I have heard repeated. 

Here is an excerpt: (this is after a man spits in the Buddha's face, realizes his behavior was wrong and comes back to apologize the next day) 

""
The man looked at Buddha and said, “Forgive me for what I did yesterday.”
Buddha said, “Forgive? But I am not the same man to whom you did it. The Ganges goes on flowing, it is never the same Ganges again. Every man is a river. The man you spit upon is no longer here. I look just like him, but I am not the same, much has happened in these twenty-four hours! The river has flowed so much. So I cannot forgive you because I have no grudge against you.

And you also are new. I can see you are not the same man who came yesterday because that man was angry and he spit, whereas you are bowing at my feet, touching my feet. How can you be the same man? You are not the same man, so let us forget about it. Those two people, the man who spit and the man on whom he spit, both are no more. Come closer. Let us talk of something else.”

(not an academic or scriptural source; simply anecdotal. It's on other sites as well if anyone wants to look further into it ) 

I feel like this story does portray the idea of no self even if it's not a real story of the Buddha's life"
BPD,fky5wmb,t3_fl4ksa,1584642160.0,I have 2-3 friends that don't live nearby anymore. One friend in the place I live. I'm doing my best to socialize more (well I was before the virus). It's a lonely life.

Being able to drink again is probably the only good thing about having a misscarriage..... I don't judge her at all and I'd probably be thinking the same thing."
insaneparents,f9emich,t1_f9efjez,1575246541.0,This is abuse outright. You are 18 so you can legally leave (thankfully) but I just want you to know that what he did IS NOT OKAY. I would tell him that he can never lay his hands on me & that if he does one more time you're out of his life for good. I know it's prob a really scary and stressful situation and I'm really sorry :( but he doesn't have the right to touch you. Ever. No matter what.
insaneparents,f9em636,t1_f9e1a52,1575246377.0,"Jesus Christ if you're 18 and your father ""pats you down"" you need to RUN. He seems insane and possibly dangerous. 
It makes it worse that you're a woman, as that can really be seen as a violation, but doing this to your kid of any gender or age is outright wrong. 
Please get tf out of there and never let him touch you again."
