AmItheAsshole,f8gqjvl,t3_e0muyw,1574563623.0,"NTA I suffer from anxiety too and struggled with being off of my meds when I was pregnant. I even tried breastfeeding but it was too much. Those first few weeks were incredibly tough. The best thing you and your wife can do is what you two think is best. That's it. The family can wait until things settle a bit to meet your son. I don't think you are doing anything wrong. 

I will say, though, being a parent is hard. My daughter is 5 now and i still struggle with anxiety about whether or not I am doing things right. From what other moms have told me, this is just how it is. But you learn to take it day by day. And you will mess up. Nothing ever goes according to plan and there is never enough time. 

I don't know your wife's whole emotional health journey, but if it ever gets too much, even with the medication, she should give therapy a chance. I had nearly crippling anxiety not long ago and going to therapy once a week (along with medication) helped me learn how to handle things. Especially getting ""advice."" I know people mean well, but every child is different and ever family is different and what works for them may not work for you. 

She may need reassurance as your child grows up. I know I did. 

I guess my point is that you are doing the right thing now, but don't let her anxiety get out of control where she shuts herself up and pushing everyone else out from fear of facing confrontation. In the end, she won't feel like herself and she will be miserable. 

I know this from experience. 

Congrats on the new baby! It truly is a wonderful thing!"

AmItheAsshole,f5rdegq,t1_f5rcwi5,1572392465.0,Oh the company is not a Christian company. It doesn't affiliate with religion at all. It's like a construction company. The only policy they have that mentions religion is that you shouldn't discuss religion on the clock.
AskReddit,f5rcs4l,t3_douu21,1572392155.0,"Right before a meal, when they all gather to pray, just start making your plate. They will all call you an asshole."
AmItheAsshole,f5ra4k2,t1_f5r8j8g,1572390804.0,"I have always treated them with respect and sensitivity. I only asked if I would be the asshole. It was just a question. But I always stand with the group and bow my head. 

Also, I have not been in a situation to say the pledge of allegiance since leaving high school, which was over ten years ago now. But I did impress my kid the other day when I recited it. Guess when you say it so much for so many years it sticks with you. 

I don't really go out to dinner with large crowds. Typically, if we go out, its just my husband and I. But I can't imagine making someone wait to eat until my food has been served. That seems rude to me. Eat it while its warm. 

I don't think the assumptions were fair. You know what happens when you assume...."

AmItheAsshole,f5paehi,t1_f5p4goy,1572354123.0,"I mean....would I be asking if i knew it? And yeah, it's not about waiting. It isn't about eating. Its about the fact that they assume everyone prays."

AmItheAsshole,f5om0rt,t1_f5olx23,1572322191.0,That is what I'm wondering too when it comes to the respect comments.
AmItheAsshole,f5olxj7,t1_f5olvh4,1572322104.0,That is true.
AmItheAsshole,f5oloiu,t1_f5oln99,1572321865.0,Yeah probably.
AmItheAsshole,f5olm15,t1_f5ol6sd,1572321803.0,"And you know, I totally get the praying with your patients. Its about comfort and I imagine that is just part of the care. That is being respectful. But I do find the staff prayers inappropriate. But you are right, along with the others here, I doubt it would be worth it. And it would be passive aggressive."
AmItheAsshole,f5oleqc,t1_f5ol6sd,1572321611.0,Thank you very much for your input.
AmItheAsshole,f5ol8tm,t1_f5ol6eq,1572321457.0,So then is it a big deal if I quietly made my plate?
AmItheAsshole,f5ol0f5,t1_f5okyzr,1572321240.0,That's fair.
AmItheAsshole,f5okulo,t1_f5okomq,1572321092.0,"I don't think it should be like a whole group thing. Like they say, ""ok, everyone gather around for the prayer before we eat."" If individuals or even smaller groups choose to pray, by all means, but for the supervisors to host it, I find inappropriate. But not enough to ever report them or try to stop it."
AmItheAsshole,f5okost,t1_f5ojv0u,1572320946.0,"That is interesting. Do you think religious people are owed more respect than non religious? I'm not trying to come off as a smart ass here. I find it interesting that if I skipped the prayer it would be disrespectful, but the fact that they pray at work isn't disrespectful. But maybe I am missing something?"
AmItheAsshole,f5okee3,t1_f5oji5s,1572320691.0,That makes sense. Thank you.
AmItheAsshole,f5okbm1,t1_f5ok3q4,1572320624.0,"Yeah at a work function. I find it a bit inappropriate. It's not the end of the world. I think I find it odd more than anything. Especially, with where I work."
AmItheAsshole,f5ok723,t1_f5ojz0q,1572320512.0,"I'm not like dying to eat lol don't get me wrong. I think it is more the principal of it. I can wait, I always have. In fact, i usually, sit back for the line to die down. I have just always wondered about just skipping the prayer and how it would come off."
AmItheAsshole,f5ok1az,t1_f5ojvo8,1572320372.0,"I mean, I see it as a little rude that they assume everyone is on the same page in what they believe."

We need someone who will bring the country together, but I don't know if that is even possible. As much as i, personally, don't agree with the far right, they are still apart of this country and using wording against them, like she did with some of her plans, just creates further divide. 

But maybe we are too far gone for all that. 

From listening to my conservative co-workers, it seems they write her off because she is a ""liar"" since they believe she lied about being a Native American. Which is funny that lying is a deal breaker for ole Liz here, but Trump gets a pass, but whatever."
