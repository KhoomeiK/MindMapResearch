My favorite Blizz character is hard to tell because i have so many! But one that comes into mind is Illidan. Not due to his doings in WoW but before. I like that this guy went against the whole legion on his own while supposedly working for them, and he had the most interesting allies. In campaign his was the most fun missions because of being able to play Blood Elves/Nagas/Night Elves and evem Draeni(broken ones) at the same time. Kael is also anothrr cool character thwt i loved before blizz ruined him so them being allies is another plus. Lady Vasjh wasnt particularly super cool like those but Nagas are freakin cool and unique to play. Also illidan did quite a lot of good evwn when he was blamed for everything."

Downtuning isn't a must (Lamb of God ) but it's generally easier to sound heavy that way imo. But honestly I think a lot of bands get pretty heavy on guitars whether be it power or death metal, and 7 strings are more mainstream than ever, making that ""downtuned sound"" a standard on guitars. For me biggest game changer seems to be the drums, and also vocals differ a lot from badn to band ofc."
