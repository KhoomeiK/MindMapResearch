This was an interesting argument between me, and my ex girlfriend. She really didnt see why men can have their shirts off but not women.

I remember I was 4 (coincidentally the same as you) when I was sexually abused by a girl (also 8 years older than me coincidentally). My parents took this girl in as a foster kid, and I considered her my sister within days. One day she kept bothering me to go up stairs with her. She locked me in a bathroom with her, and told me I couldnt leave until I agreed to do ""sex"" with her. I did not agree too and could not leave no matter how hard I tried. In the moment I knew this was one of the things my parents tought me to scream, kick, and fight my way out of, but I couldnt. I didnt want my parents to make her go somewhere else, and I didnt want my parents to think I was weak (I always thought they saw me as very strong). I eventually agreed just so that I could get out of that bathroom. I tried playing the waiting game with her but I thought she would wait all night. 

Once I agreed she took me to my room, and told me to take my clothes off. I had an erection because my body didnt know how to react (I think because of past sexual abuses by cousin) and she sat on it. It didnt go in and I just remember severe pain and discomfort, and her bouncing on it. I dont know why it didnt go in but I also dont remember looking to see if it did (I didnt know what sex was). This continued for months before my parents sent her somewhere else because she didnt get along with my sisters. 

Fast forward to me being 12-13 and not hearing of her for a long time, one of my sisters found out she was pregnant on Facebook. This broke my heart. I dont know why it did. I may had been worried she put another kid through what she put me through and got pregnant, and I also worried I was in love with her that whole time. I'm 17 now, and I do not love her, I hate her. I hurt very oftenly knowing someone like that has a child. I don't know how I'm affected by this in all honestly its very confusing. I know she hurt me, but I dont know to what degree.

I dont want you to think you have to stay with her. I want you to know that you can find a girl that treats you how you deserve. Talk to her and tell her how all those things affected you and what way they did. And if you aren't satisfied with her answered or with anything in general you can leave your marriage and find someone far better. You have to be strong."
