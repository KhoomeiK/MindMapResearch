academia,fpx9o8e,t3_gg1rf8,1588978367.0,"Your quote about ""maybe higher education just isn't for everyone"" is directly related to worry about graduation rates. When administration is only concerned about revenue and increasing enrollment, you get a lot of students who can't hack it. Many of those people end up dropping out. It's not making it more accessible, it's lowering standards. Accessibility is removing barriers. Increasing tuition while lowering standards is the opposite of that. I do not think higher education should be a privilege. But I think the current system of primary education is so effed in so many ways that no matter what we do at the University level, students are simply not prepared. Making higher education more accessible starts at the bottom. It starts at removing socioeconomic barriers present way earlier in life than college. And there also is a general recognition that college isn't always necessary for what people want to do. And it's not necessary for a lot of trades. Takes all kinds."

Contrary to popular belief carpenter ants are not really causing the issue - they are more symptoms of an issue. They are not causing any additional damage than was already there.

Do you have any areas with consistent water or moisture issues? Do you have a lot of mulch or debris around the outside of your home? If so, the first thing I would do is clean that up. You never want organic matter butting up to your home. Sanitation is the number one way to prevent issues like this. Diatomaceous earth might help a little but, honestly is not a great pest control method for things like winged ants. You want to find the source and get rid of it."

Professors,fpdfigu,t3_gct2dd,1588525982.0,I do actually give peer reviews for group projects. I tell them at the beginning of the semester and probably 2-3 times throughout that they will be graded by their peers. There is still always that one person who does absolutely nothing. The funny thing is that most people are harsher on themselves than everyone else EXCEPT the person who does nothing. They are the ones who rate themselves as a 10 when everyone else says they did a 3. And I do adjust grades by these by taking the average rating by their peers and multiplying that by the group's overall grade.

I've always had Bipolar, and I have had suicidal ideations before getting pregnant. But post partum depression threw me for a loop I didn't know existed. Same here re: abusive relationships (until my husband). Really, what I wanted was to be single and go to a sperm bank. I didn't want a husband and I never wanted to get married. But SSRIs and mood stabilizers, plus my logical brain staying turned on and saying ""you don't really want to do this"" and my husband all together saved my life. And now that my son is 18 months old I still struggle (even more with quarantine and what not going on) but my son is there absolute coolest person I have ever met in my life. He is so smart and funny and thoughtful. He has emotional maturity beyond the years of some of the professionals I work with. So yes, the idea that an internet stranger is telling me I shouldn't have him bc I have mental illness upset me quite a bit. I'm sorry I lashed out - and I'm sorry to hear about your friend. That's awful. 

This boy really does mean the world to me. And yes, he likely has a somewhat different, if not difficult, road ahead due to the combo of mine and my husband's mental illnesses (both ADHD, me Bipolar I and him OCD) but really I think us having those makes us more in tune to the struggles he may have. We are very much aware of the effect it has on our lives and are very cognizant of what we do and say in front of him to minimize any environmental input to triggering those illnesses. It's always a balancing act. I also ate sushi, had a couple glasses of wine etc while I was pregnant. I hated being viewed as an extension of my baby. And while I love him beyond measure, my happiness and my life matter, too. And if we eventually decide to have another one, I'm sure not quitting my meds bc I like feeling somewhat normal and it's not fair to anyone to have me go back to being a puddle of tears physcially incapable of moving.

We got to the point a few years ago (before I ever got pregnant) where we decided to split, at least for a while. We were talking logistics. He had worked out a deal with his cousin to stay with him for a while. Things were clearly ending between us. And we definitely did do some name calling and screaming during that period. But even so, we apologized after and treated each other with respect when everything was said and done. Even when we thought things were over we were still best friends. Best friends fight (and sometimes they fight the hardest) but at the end of the day you are there for that person. Even if he is desperately unhappy, I cannot believe he wouldn't hold it together to keep the baby and you safe. That's what scares me honestly. You are clearly in a dangerous situation and he can't even suck up his pride to keep your stress levels down. There's a time and a place for everything and you being bed ridden under doctor's watch and bleeding is not the time for anything except kindness. He clearly has some other issues going on and if he won't talk to you about them, he's not mature enough to be raising a child with (at least not in the same home).

I know not all schools had those trainings. But even with them, apparently some profs are still unprepared to move their courses online so they put the impetus on the students who are probably less prepared than we are. At least we have stable jobs. Every semester my students go through so much stuff that we just never know about. They are still going through normal life stuff while ALSO going through all of this crap (as is everyone). It makes total sense that some of it simply doesn't translate well to an online platform.

He agreed to let me drive a car he had paid off and also pay for the insurance and maintenance as long as I was in school full time and getting good grades. Well the car got to the point where it would break down every couple months and we lived nearly an hour apart so it wasn't feasible to keep it when I needed to get to school and work and I couldn't easily work out logistics with him. I also found out that he was not okay with me parking it at my mom's house (out of spite) and was essentially controlling everything I did at this point. I calculated all the maintenance and it was easily costing more each year to keep it running than what the car was worth so I suggested I get a new (to me) car thinking the deal would still stand. It apparently did not. He refused to help me buy a car and also quit paying for all insurance, maintenance etc. But the old car was broken down and I straight up couldn't drive it and had to get another one. Queue 17 year old naivety and negotiation skills and I ended up with basically a lemon that also broke down like 3 months later. End of the story I ended up taking several thousand dollars in negative equity and taking forever to pay off my Civic (which is still running to this day). Took me two jobs (sometimes 3) while in school full time but it got me out from his control. Good on you for standing your ground! It'll pay off."
psychology,fo5bo27,t1_fo56ads,1587521835.0,"Two year olds are still working on cause and effect. Spanking doesn't work especially at that age bc the punishment and action don't go together. You said you don't remember so my hunch is that that's a nice story your dad told you but I have a very hard time believing it. At two years old kids really aren't capable of putting together ""I left without telling my dad so he spanked me"". That kind of reasoning doesn't come for multiple years."

Mommit,fnz5vqf,t3_g4in43,1587386879.0,"It's ok to feel all of that. My husband and I talk somewhat frequently about how weird it is to love someone so much and also be so exhausted by them. I remember at that age it was an accomplishment just to get out of bed. I basically just breastfed, slept for 45 mins repeat. My husband literally fed me cracker barrel while I fed our baby. I couldn't do anything for a month probably. Ours is now 18 months and he's so much fun. The newborn stage is insane. It does get better though. Once he started crawling my back felt a million times better from not carrying him everywhere. It's incremental with huge milestones thrown in there. Hang in there. You will sleep again!"

academia,fnscg2k,t1_fnsbu5b,1587218536.0,I tell them to do both. This semester two of my students in the same stats class came to me complaining about stuff their prof was saying so I told them that if they were seriously offended or concerned that they had every right to demand a respectful classroom and that I know that Prof well enough to know they would respond well to their comments. They also wanted to drop bc it was too hard. That one I told them that it was time to learn some good mindfulness exercises and that a B wouldn't kill them in grad school. Another consistent piece of advice I give them is to reframe their experience in terms of what they are gaining in knowledge and experience vs their grade. I don't think they ever talked to the Prof though.
academia,fns4qcw,t1_fnrejt1,1587212590.0,"Is this your program manager or multiple people? Also, are you in the US? I'm not sure exactly where program director falls on the heirarchy. Is that essentially your dept head?"
academia,fns3wgw,t1_fnruvao,1587211839.0,"When my students come to me with similar issues I tell them that this sounds like a great opportunity to practice some mindfulness and find a constructive way to deal with anxiety. I also tell them to directly talk to the person in question. If they feel they are being insulted, they have every right to tell the person (faculty or not) to stop doing whatever it is they're doing. I suggest they find a therapist (because I think everyone should have a therapist). Just like the high school writing comment isn't constructive, neither are most of the comments in here. It's not helpful or constructive to say ""poor you, those people are assholes*. How does that help OP progress? OP needs to address the person,/people, find some way to positively deal with this energy, learn to filter comments for what they are worth (if anything), and derail the anxiety train.

Edit: if they don't feel SAFE that is a different issue. I always go to bat for my students in those situations. But someone being a dick colleague is a perfect opportunity for them to learn some communication and mindfulness skills."
academia,fnr8noa,t1_fnr880y,1587182042.0,"Right, and I'm saying that's the only example OP gave which, to me, is a far stretch from academics love to tear students down. For the level of intensity OP seems to be at, I expected a novel of examples. But the entire post is their feelings about what people mean. ""they all but said I'm unintelligent and should quit"". Ok what did they ACTUALLY say? To me it sounds like OP is getting a reality check on what meets certain standards and is getting anxious/defensive about it. If their advisor says they're great and someone sucks at giving feedback.....I would just say quit paying so much attention to that feedback. Just like some people suck at writing, some people suck at giving feedback. OP needs to learn how to filter those comments and again, not take everything so personally. Although I still don't classify the high school comment as ""nasty""."
academia,fnr7fk2,t1_fnr715o,1587181160.0,"I think you misunderstand what I mean by thicken your skin. I don't condone the idea of ""I had to deal with it so you do, too"". I'm saying sometimes writing is just bad. Sometimes it doesn't make any sense. And sometimes people need to be told that. You can't expect people to be soft and gentle all the time. I don't think the example comment was constructive bc it didn't tell OP how to improve. But OP included no other evidence except their own feelings. And if that's the harshest comment they've gotten, my thinking is that they are just being a bit sensitive. Sometimes harsh is necessary. What constitutes excellence at an undergrad or Masters level doesn't cut it at the PhD level."
academia,fnr71jk,t1_fnr6jgt,1587180886.0,"A personal insult. I've had reviewers who were clearly offended that I hadn't cited them in my manuscript and proceeded to just be jerks throughout the review. Telling me I didn't understand my own project etc. Something along the lines of ""this doesn't make any sense"" doesn't faze me though. I would really need more than just that one example though. My initial thoughts are that OP is simply being overly sensitive. Even if ""this is high school writing"" is considered ""mean"", stretching it to the assertion that academics love to tear down students seems like a bit much."
JusticeServed,fnr5x6b,t1_fnr5pyf,1587180077.0,Not graduating is not ruining their lives first of all. It's called a GED and plenty of people have them. I did a lot of stupid shit as a teenager but I've never committed hate speech. Smoking weed. Shoplifting. Sneaking out. These are typical highschool things high schoolers do to get in trouble. If you can't see how those are on a different playing field than racism and hate speech I can't help you.

SharedBPM,fnr529j,t3_g38mt4,1587179479.0,This is the kind of quality content I follow this sub for
academia,fnqyu94,t3_g3am56,1587175257.0,"IMO that comment really isn't mean, it's an observation and not particularly helpful but I wouldn't call it mean. If you want to complete a PhD and continue in academia then, I hate to say it, but it sounds like you need to thicken your skin a bit. I remember literally crying over reviewer comments on my first rejected publication. I have cried over comments from my PhD advisor. Academia, especially STEM I think, is harsh sometimes. Just a few weeks ago I submitted a proposal with 3 Co-PIs. I'm pretty new faculty and they are much more seasoned than me. I read way harsher comments than ""this is high school writing"" and seriously thought I was doing a horrible job. But at the end I was congratulated and told great job pulling it all together. 

As a PhD student you are starting to be treated more like a colleague. My best friends tell me that my writing is nonsense when I have them review things for me. I'm sure it's not what you want to hear but I really think you need to learn to not take everything so personally.

Edit: my interpretation of this post is that OP is used to being praised and has a lot of insecurities surrounding their intelligence and abilities (which is not at all uncommon). They are reading into comments and making assumptions about people's meanings. OP needs to take some responsibility here and confront the issue in a professional way.

Edit 2: with some more details I vote we take this person down (not OP). This isn't critiquing this is abuse.  I was thinking this was a standard first semester PhD student complaint but it's far beyond that. This deserves formal complaints."
LadiesofScience,fnnc7mm,t3_g2dvej,1587089065.0,"Wow. Sorry you're dealing with that. I didn't have my first baby until 31 and I'm glad we waited that long. Granted we still live several hours from any family which does make it oversupply difficult, but we didn't even start trying until I had a permanent job and was finished with my PhD. I cannot imagine doing this during grad school on a student's salary. That said, people do it every damn day. And I applaud them. But you don't have a SO so what the hell is she yapping about? I would clap back at her with something like ""well if you want to move down/up/over here to be a free live in nanny, then sure I'll get right on that"" or ""oh, are you going to pay for its living expenses?"" 

My guess is she is feeling the weight of her own mortality and is projecting that on to you. Humans do weird things when they get older. My husband's Grandma says stuff to my husband about ""taking care of his dad when he gets older"". Don't worry, boo. You're doing great. You have a long journey ahead of you and there's no need to rush. Laugh her off. You got this."
niceguys,fnh9qv2,t3_g1kfxz,1586958140.0,"I used to deliver pizza in my early 20s. I delivered to an auto parts store and the guy was sort of creepy. Asked for my phone number and I declined (he was also significantly older than me). He then called the store everyday for a week ordering hoping I'd have to come back. He even said that to one of the people taking his order, who immediately told me. I told my manager I was afraid to deliver to him again and he was blocked from ordering from that store. I never really felt unsafe delivering except for a few times, that being one of them. It's definitely creepy being alone, walking up to someone's house or business (or car), and knowing that you could potentially be in danger each time. 

One time I narrowly escaped being beaten and robbed (maybe more) by three guys. A coworker had been beaten and robbed a couple weeks before in a neighborhood after dark. I got an order, drove to the house and all the lights were off which is an automatic red flag. I called the number and a woman answered who said she didn't order and also didn't live at that address. That exact moment I saw three guys standing about 30 feet away by the stop sign and knew what was about to happen so I took off. The coworker before was a guy so who knows if I would have been raped as well as I was a young woman much smaller than my coworker. Turns out they had done it to every pizza place in the area and were cought some days later. I'm so glad I don't have to work in food service anymore."

academia,fn1vw2y,t3_fyfms4,1586571370.0,"I don't understand why. These graduate students probably interviewed before the shit hit the fan and were made offers towards the beginning of the fan-shit-hitting. I have two new students starting this fall and you can bet that if my program was in jeopardy due to this crisis I would let them know ASAP. I don't want them uprooting their lives to be told half a semester in that their money had to be reallocated due to massive drops in state funding or tuition. During my PhD I received a grant as Co-PI with my advisor. I was supposed to travel to South Africa, meet with these fancy colleagues, do a bunch of really cool stuff with that money. Guess what. Huge wildfires happened and my money (that was already supposed to be allocated to my project) was straight up taken by another program to pay for damages and labor for firefighters. I never traveled to South Africa. I never met those colleagues. And I had to scramble to come up with new, cheaper, project ideas. Shit happens. This is exactly why you have a backup plan. It sucks but it surely isn't the school's responsibility to pay for people who haven't accepted an offer. The other schools those students interviewed at are likely doing the same thing and then Arizona would be on the hook for a bunch of students accepting positions simply to have a paycheck. None of it is fair to anyone but I definitely don't lose any respect for Arizona. Seems like a rational move to me."
