It's such a deeply spiritual and moving experience for me, and even though there is some discomfort involved at times, I think it's a necessary part of the process. I've learned so much more about myself through my experiences than I could have imagined, and can honestly say after 10+ years of therapy it has done more to change my life than those sessions ever did. I experienced some indescribably beautiful moments of clarity, love, and gratitude that I can't even put into words.
