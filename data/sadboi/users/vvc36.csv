BPD,f6vrt9t,t3_dt75y9,1573197472.0,I learned to keep a list on me of dumb boring go to distractions. It's literally so dumb but it helps so much. When you're feeling that way just look at your pre set list of activities like what you just did..take a bath..listen to jazz..etc and the discipline is just doing something from the list with no excuse and let time pass. It helps that its premade cause you don't have to put thought into it or come up with excuses and it's stuff you already know you like. You just need to do something to allow time to pass. There's even an image thing you can use to distract yourself. They call it something like distract and relax if I remember correctly. I have a folder in my phone of images and if I'm out and something bothers me I just open the folder and look at the pics I set in there...just put pics that make you happy and distract you. For me it was drag pics cause I'm a drag queen.

BPD,ex5dyvs,t3_creif2,1566021884.0,I was  diagnosed at age 19 and did not accept my diagnoses until I was 31(34 now). My life changed once I came to terms with it and I allowed myself to be helped. So I guess what I'm saying is...as hard as is it to hear it can only help you understand and work towards finding ways to cope. ♡
BPD,erw0bfv,t3_c4dasp,1561329709.0,Yep. But try to remember that everyone fucks up...just unfortunately when we fuck up it's more noticeable.
