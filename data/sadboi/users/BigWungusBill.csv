SuicideWatch,fnpr1cz,t3_g2zfxd,1587150420.0,"I can’t relate to exactly how you feel.

But I know what it’s like to be betrayed by someone you care about.

I’ve tried to kill myself over 20 times since it happened a couple months ago. I’m still hoping my time will come soon. People are absolutely horrible. They don’t care about each other. She doesn’t care about me. 

The difference between you and me though is that you have people who rely on you. And maybe you can be strong for them so that someday they can grow up to be the kind of people who would never do what your ex or my ex or my ex do. 

It really is the hardest thing. Every day I want to kill myself knowing how little I meant to her. She doesn’t even know the pain. It hurts feeling so worthless.

But you have people who need you. Right now the pain is all you feel. I get that. I really do. Maybe try to think of your kids? And the life that they could have? Be strong for them because the pain you feel now? It will really fuck them up having a dead Mom, and I don’t think you want to cause them that same pain you feel.

Just survive. I’m not gonna tell you to get better because I know you can’t just get better. But survive for them because they need you. See a Therapist if you can. Don’t forget that they need you."

If a person in Wyoming’s vote is 3.6 times as powerful as a person in California’s vote what’s to stop California from seceding? 

It does not matter where the people are located, one person one vote works so that the majority of the country may decide its fate. The minority shouldn’t get more of a say simply because there are less of them. If we were living in a house with 3 people. And 2 of us said, lets have pizza for dinner. And one said, no I want nails for dinner, and since there’s two of you it’s only fair for my one vote towards eating nails to count as 3 votes. That wouldn’t be fair.
