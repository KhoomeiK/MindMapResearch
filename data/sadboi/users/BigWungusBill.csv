But I know what it‚Äôs like to be betrayed by someone you care about.

I‚Äôve tried to kill myself over 20 times since it happened a couple months ago. I‚Äôm still hoping my time will come soon. People are absolutely horrible. They don‚Äôt care about each other. She doesn‚Äôt care about me. 

The difference between you and me though is that you have people who rely on you. And maybe you can be strong for them so that someday they can grow up to be the kind of people who would never do what your ex or my ex or my ex do. 

It really is the hardest thing. Every day I want to kill myself knowing how little I meant to her. She doesn‚Äôt even know the pain. It hurts feeling so worthless.

But you have people who need you. Right now the pain is all you feel. I get that. I really do. Maybe try to think of your kids? And the life that they could have? Be strong for them because the pain you feel now? It will really fuck them up having a dead Mom, and I don‚Äôt think you want to cause them that same pain you feel.

Just survive. I‚Äôm not gonna tell you to get better because I know you can‚Äôt just get better. But survive for them because they need you. See a Therapist if you can. Don‚Äôt forget that they need you."
