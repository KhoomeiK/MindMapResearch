And yes, there is a lot of overlap between bipolar and BPD. I have also had tremendous struggles with abandonment panic, black-and-white thinking, etc., but I didn't meet enough of the criteria to be diagnosed with BPD.

My perspective on all of it is that diagnoses can be helpful in many ways but the most important part is looking at the symptoms and treating them. Even though I don't have BPD I did a lot of BPD-specific therapy and have worked through many of the symptoms I had. To my knowledge there are no meds that can treat dissociation but it is something that can absolutely be addressed in therapy."

A lot of things can cause dissociation. It’s most commonly associated with trauma but it can also be a response to intense stress or depression. It’s one of the brain’s methods of coping with severe distress by detaching from reality.

bipolar,fq589j8,t1_fq4uwax,1589095834.0,"I have heard wildly differently from dieticians. [Health.gov](https://health.gov/our-work/food-nutrition/2015-2020-dietary-guidelines/guidelines/appendix-2/) says women in their 20s-30s who are moderately active need 2000-2200 calories. To keep our bodies working properly. Eating less than that is depriving your body of the energy it needs to survive.

I recommend looking up the Minnesota Semi-Starvation Experiment. A group of people were given 1600 calories a day for six months and it took a huge toll on them physically and psychologically.

>Among the conclusions from the study was the confirmation that prolonged semi-starvation produces significant increases in depression, hysteria and hypochondriasis as measured using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Indeed, most of the subjects experienced periods of severe emotional distress and depression.\[1\]:161 There were extreme reactions to the psychological effects during the experiment including self-mutilation... There were marked declines in physiological processes indicative of decreases in each subject's basal metabolic rate (the energy required by the body in a state of rest), reflected in reduced body temperature, respiration and heart rate. Some of the subjects exhibited edema in their extremities, presumably due to decreased levels of plasma proteins given that the body's ability to construct key proteins like albumin is based on available energy sources.

\-[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota\_Starvation\_Experiment#Results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Starvation_Experiment#Results)

This was on 1600 calories and is considered semi-starvation.

Restricting food on the level that you are doing has had long-lasting physical and mental consequences for me. I'm saying this from experience, this is a bad road to go down. A thin body isn't possible for everyone (especially on psych meds that can alter our metabolisms). If you're trying to lose weight and you can't, that's an indicator that you are at your natural weight. If you are eating nutritiously (and *enough*) and exercising regularly, you are doing everything you can to maintain your health and don't need to worry about your weight.

I'm not going to interact with this thread anymore because it's really triggering to me. Please take care of yourself. Your body deserves the amount of food that it needs, regardless of your weight."

Maybe more than a few? If the suicidal feelings ever become more immediate or you develop a plan, please reach out and get yourself to the hospital.

I don't want to sound like I'm 'cured' or anything because I'm not. I'm actually depressed right now. But it's *nothing* like it used to be. Depression used to feel like I was drowning, like there was a gaping, bleeding hole in my chest, like nothing was ever going to be okay and I wanted to die. Now it's more like 'okay, I'm feeling down and tired and crying all the time, I'm going to do my best to take care of myself and reach out to my treatment team while I wait for this to pass.' It still sucks, but it's livable.

I cannot recommend Dialectical Behavior Therapy enough. It's designed specifically *for* people with BPD *by* a psychologist who has BPD. She saw first hand how the mental healthcare system was failing people with BPD and she made a whole type of therapy designed for those people. The program is a series of group 'classes' plus individual therapy with a DBT therapist to cement the concepts and apply them to your specific circumstances. One round of the group takes up to a year, depending on how long the sessions are. It's pretty intense and isn't a 'quick fix' but holy shit it WORKS.

Sorry if that's a ton of unsolicited advice. I just want you to know that you are not alone with what you're dealing with, and to let you know that you're not a lost cause. Hang in there."

BipolarReddit,foxdexr,t3_ga0ohm,1588140657.0,Good job!! That is a really huge accomplishment!! I don’t have a yard but I keep many potted plants on my patio and taking care of them tends to help my mood.

On the other hand, I do see the value in someone calling it a disorder if it helps them to see it or talk about it that way. The way the world is set up makes it difficult for us to function."
bipolar,fopvhdk,t1_fopsrd6,1587973491.0,"Asking for help is really, really, really difficult.

But I also understand where you're coming from."
BipolarReddit,fopvb59,t3_g8g4lv,1587973325.0,"The ideal scenario is learning to manage your emotions in such a way that you can tolerate triggers. I find that if I can recognize and acknowledge my anger and irritability early on, I can step away and use coping skills to reduce my anger, then return to what I was doing without being derailed by my emotions. Sometimes learning to tolerate triggers is more effective than cutting them out completely."
bipolar,foputnq,t3_g8uwj9,1587972862.0,"I've lived with a puppy twice in my life, and for the first 2 years they are *really* difficult, as is the mess they come with. Some people swear it's worth it to raise them from puppies but I find that I have trouble fully bonding with a puppy (and I am a BIG time animal lover) because they frustrate me to the point of tears. I can't emotionally handle the insane amounts of energy, the peeing-in-the-house cleanup, the destruction, and the regression in training they go through during adolescence. I find that I bond much more easily with older dogs.

I technically got my dog as a senior (she belonged to a family member before I took her in) and she has been a godsend. I love her to pieces and she helps me so much emotionally, as well as getting me outside every day. She's loving, mellow, and her adorable antics make me smile even on my worst days. It bears mentioning that I did a ton of research on dog training and put in a lot of work training her for the first few months I had her, so that's part of the reason why she's as well-behaved and mellow as she is.

My partner does help me with dog care when I'm in a bad place (things like taking her out to pee when I sleep for 12+ hours, walking her if I'm in the fetal position on the couch crying, etc.) but I find that I can manage it most of the time.

I recommend having some conversations with your partner and trying to gauge how much work each of you are willing to put in (i.e. is she willing to take over dog care when you're unwell?). Another option is to try fostering a dog through a shelter or rescue organization and see how it fits in your home. Whatever you decide, make sure to research positive reinforcement training methods as well as read about breeds before choosing your dog."

bipolar,fope2px,t1_fonjgcj,1587959158.0,I'm so sorry you are going through this. Reading this is giving me memories of what a hell depression is. Do you have family or friends who could help you set up appointments? I have had to ask for help with that at times.

We only have so much control over it. It *is* possible to change thought patterns with behavioral therapy (I have had tremendous success with DBT), but the bipolar symptoms are not related to thoughts, they are related to neurotransmitters (chemicals, basically, that are released from different parts of the brain). Therapy has helped me in many ways but it doesn't stop the episodes."

I've never been proposed to or had anything happen on that level, but when something exciting happens in my life (having an amazing gig, getting asked out by a crush, going to see my favorite band live, etc.) I usually have a 'comedown' later on where I feel low for a while. I think it's just an unfortunate reality of having a brain that doesn't know how to regulate itself. And I imagine the anticipation of wedding planning and all of that adds a layer of anxiety.

Anyways, I think what you're feeling is normal. And congrats again!"

bipolar,foivr22,t3_g7dsne,1587798641.0,"What you are experiencing is **not your fault.** You have an illness. It's easy for the other people in our lives to say we're ""not trying hard enough"" or we ""should be doing better"" but that is the stigma talking. Everyone reacts to this illness VERY differently. Some people are able to push through and function at a high level, others are completely debilitated by it. There is no shame in either one, they're just different manifestations. You are not alone in your experiences. I'm also low-functioning and I understand the shame you feel, but I am gradually learning that being ill/disabled is not my fault and comparing myself to others will only hurt me.

It's also important to note that many people are lower-functioning at first but with treatment (which unfortunately takes time, sometimes a long time) they eventually become higher-functioning.

Keep taking your meds and going to your appointments. If you keep taking your meds (even if they're not working right now--it can take a lot of experimentation) and going to therapy, this WILL get better. Even if you've given up right now, that's okay, just find a way to keep dragging yourself to your appointments and taking your meds.

Hang in there. Even if it doesn't feel like it right now, things WILL get better. You have a long life ahead of you."

BipolarReddit,fo5x0wa,t3_g5r93p,1587538492.0,"After high school I didn't feel ready for college at all but went anyways (mostly to get out of my toxic family situation) and had a huge crisis. I somehow made it through the year (I was beyond miserable, suicidal, and self-harming, with no support network or medical help) but after a psychotic episode I was hospitalized and suspended from school. I took over 3 years off to try to recover from that mother f'er of an episode and get long-overdue treatment before going back to school part-time. I'm 25 now and still haven't gotten my bachelor's. And that's completely okay.

Education isn't a race, and honestly I'm grateful that I've taken it so slowly. I have a better idea of what I want out of my education than I did when I was 18. During the time I took off I got a feel for what the world is like, who I am, and what I want from life. I had noooo idea what I was doing when I was 18.

That's my experience at least. The biggest thing I've learned is that my health has to be #1. It's more important than school, more important than my passions, more important than work. Health has to be #1 in our lives."

The bipolar diagnosis certainly didn't surprise anyone in my family!"
