AstralProjection,fqlbjjr,t3_gjga24,1589453012.0,"Dissociation is your mind's way of detaching itself from its experiences. Whether that be emotions, your perception of yourself *(depersonalization)*, or your surroundings *(derealization)*. Usually because there are stressors in your life that overwhelm you.

Astral projection is in a nutshell not much more than the perception of the astral. You might control your astral body, do energy work, do magick, or whatever else. But at its root you're perceiving the astral.

In a more general sense a traumatic OOBE could arguably be a very severe form of dissociation in anticipation of a potentially extremely hurtful event. Nothing that you'd ever want to have to experience in its full extent. Usually people report of that with car crashes. But really there's nothing stopping you having an OOBE from other sources of PTSD. There's a reason why the fight and flight model was extended by freeze *(dissociation)* and fawn.

You can dissociate without astral projecting, and you can astral project without dissociating *(in the pathological sense)*.

In my opinion they are two distinct subjects.

---

But here is where it gets trickier:

Dissociation, making you detached from your physical perception, can help you perceive the astral more easily and more clearly. Wanting to escape your physical stressors can amplify that. Astral projection itself aims your focus away from the physical, which might resemble the feeling of being dissociated.

One *might* be able to set the definition of dissociation to generally include any kind of detachment or attempted distancing from perception/reality. Which would include daydreaming, astral projection, escapism, and more. The act of trying to perceive your astral body over your physical body *might* count as a dissociative act. But that's stretching definitions really far and it wouldn't make AP a form of dissociation.



---

To sum it up really… Dissociation and AP are separate things. But dissociation can be a part of astral projecting, it can help with astral projecting, and it might even trigger an astral projection."

If I sneak up on an enemy and ram a dagger through the kidneys, spine, or heart it's very obvious they go down to the floor and die. Might not be instantly dead but for all intents and purposes it's fine to act as if they were at that point. Similarly a proper arrow to a critical organ will almost certainly be critical. Though unless you actually pierce the heart, lungs, or brain the enemy will probably not just fall over dead. Except for the strongest enemies which do take some open combat to get them dead.

This is all my personal opinion of course. But I have my fair share of struggles and been around others that do, so I hope this isn't entirely unfounded.

Basically, every person is different. There are no two humans who have an identical mind. We're all shaped by our cultures, by our experiences, by our social environment, and a lot of others. So it's just natural that some people are simply different. There are introverts and extroverts. Some people like sports, some prefer books. Some people go into academia, some people prefer manual labor. Some people are soft, empathetic, helpful, and even fragile. Some others are tougher. Some people are more compassionate while others are more goal-oriented. Some people are feminine, some masculine, some non-binary, some a mix of the above. You see what a huge variety of traits we have, and I don't think any of these should be inherently called a sickness or have other heavily negative associations. I'm against the notion that every person with a certain trait is pathologically associated. There's nothing wrong with being socially awkward, with not being able to focus so well, with having one's head a little bit more in the clouds than others, with being more emotional than the average, and so on. I think we should accept and embrace people as they are instead of immediately saying *""you have that trait so you need to forever put up with psychiatrists and you have that diagnosis and that makes you ill and you are in need of eternal treatment and you must adapt to the social average""*. Sure, if a person is suffering from their traits, and by extension if they're hurting others with it, that's still something people can work on. Absolutely. If you dislike who you are who am I to stop you from changing yourself using therapy or meds or whatever. And even then we might still want to consider if it's really the person who is inherently struggling because of it or if it's simply our messed up society that only accommodates those who abide to the social standard.

Hope I'm making some sense here and you can see my point \^\^"
DIDmemes,fnzcr2e,t3_g4t209,1587391442.0,"They've got a few points, but some of them take it way too far. I can completely agree that psychiatrists are humans who can and do make mistakes that can lead to patients being harmed. I agree that medication isn't always the solution, that they can have severe side-effects, and that they're sometimes prescribed when it's not really necessary. There's also some philosophy to be had about the diagnoses that underlie psychiatry *(such as Autism and being trans being considered behavioral and developmental illnesses)*. That policy of forcibly admitting people instead of helping them before they get to that point…

There's a lot of criticism to be made. But mental health is real, meds can help some people, psychiatrists aren't all evil, and so forth.

Oh, btw: anti-psychiatry isn't necessarily affiliated with scientology. Yes, that sect has anti-psychiatry views, but not all anti-psychiatry people do. Many of them are simply people who've been harmed greatly by malpractice."

skyrim,fnz11i9,t3_g4r8jw,1587382864.0,Looks like you've already learned it? From what I've seen the misc quests are quite bugged sometimes.
skyrim,fnyyjho,t1_fnyw2ww,1587380425.0,Thank you uwu
DIDmemes,fnyvob6,t3_g4q583,1587377410.0,That's basically me *(newly designated host)* and our 2000 traumatized headmates who can't ever let go of front for even 30 seconds.
skyrim,fnyvk28,t1_fnyriu9,1587377284.0,"German actually has *""die die die""* in some odd sentence constructions."
skyrim,fnyvb8q,t3_g4p0cf,1587377027.0,"*""I learned […] the truth that this food can and should be sublime""* would work though. The first that and second that aren't technically the same word in terms of semantics. The only reason why the sentence uses *""that food""* is because *""this food""* would only really make sense if the author was referring to some more specific dish directly in front of them.

In German it would be *""die Wahrheit, dass dieses…""* which is perfectly grammatically valid and the only difference is that we don't use the same word for the conclusion-that and the referring-to-food-that.

Though Germany actually has a few similar scenarios. See: *""Es sind __die__ __die__ __die__ Katzen füttern""*. Which means *""It is __them__ __that__ feed __the__ cats""*. Still grammatically valid apart from my lack of punctuation."
skyrim,fnxf09q,t3_g4gjzl,1587337273.0,"To put it in the words of Serana:

*""I'm okay with the dark, but I've spent more than my share of time in caves already.""*"
skyrim,fnxenon,t1_fnx9o2t,1587337073.0,"Already with the tombs. There must be 10 times more Draugr in Skyrim than living people, and 50 times as many properly dead corpses. Even if people had been there for millennia, that's barely doing it. And who built these massive underground structures, with nothing but iron pickaxes at that?

The number of houses doesn't add up either. There are what, maybe 5 to 20 houses per town/village/settlement? Even if that's one family each you get at maybe 1000 people. Which lines up roughly with the number of named NPCs. Maybe take that times 2 for the vampires, bandits, and so forth. That's just, you know, nearly impossible. That's few even by standards of medieval Europe.

Nature doesn't add up either. You don't go from the arctic pale to the almost nice Riften in 20 minutes by foot. That's maybe 2 minutes by car."
