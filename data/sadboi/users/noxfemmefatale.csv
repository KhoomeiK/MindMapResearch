I hope the supplements will help you with the anxiety and maybe other stuff!

ps: I was so happy when I saw the thread. It was like ""oh okay I'm not crazy haha"" so thanks for sharing!"
Anxiety,f78nnsp,t3_dut1qb,1573495839.0,I stopped taking the pill like a year ago and for the past few months I experienced crazy anxiety like a week prior to my period.

No dude just a panic attack no biggie. I kind of got used to it and usually it just fades away when I calm down.
I've been on medication lately and those shakes haven't occurred that often anymore. It's relieving. Have you considered taking antidepressants or something like that?"
