ACPocketCamp,fkutagk,t3_fkl19l,1584555730.0,Lol I thought the small moths were the mosquitos at first. Then I saw that dark 1-pixel shadow.

Frustrated, angry, sad, ""abandoned,"" paranoid, etc. Sometimes seeing my own scars triggers me to do it again, or also sometimes I don't really even want to do it but I'm feeling not too great and my arms start burning and itching, like they know what's  coming."

selfharm,fi8iyik,t3_f6rhpt,1582241359.0,"Similar to me. When I first started, I used a pencil sharpener blade. Clean for a few years, and when I relapsed I couldn't find it, so I used really dull scissors. They eventually didn't work for me anymore, so I found my original blade again. It hurt so much more than I remember and I'm just like damn, I must've built up quite the pain tolerance. I still use my blade now, but now I get scars every time I cut. I would try not to cause more pain than necessary because you might get used to it and have to do more each time (happening to me I think)."

BPD,fhj6ph4,t3_f3f5zy,1581639098.0,"Yeah. It happened once when talking to my friend and I'm just sitting there sobbing, not knowing what's wrong. He said it could just be stress that had been piling up throughout the week finally breaking out via tears."

It's like I'm frozen. Loud noises do bother me too, but not as bad. The only thing I like is loud music sometimes"
BPD,fhd555s,t3_f100id,1581477513.0,"The only place I really feel ""at home"" and completely at ease with is my FP/best friend. I feel like he doesn't really understand it though, because usually family=home. I don't really trust mine that much."
demisexuality,fhd4w8q,t3_f0rox3,1581477359.0,"Same with me, for a lot of close friendships I have. I've made it into a self-inside joke where it's like ""meet new friend, connect emotionally, have 'friend crush' for a month, get over it and mentally go back to thinking only friendly."" I've only had one ""true"" crush that's still ongoing."
selfharm,fgu8an8,t3_ezva2a,1581114768.0,I do it when I think too much and upset myself/have a breakdown. Cutting stops my thoughts immediately and kind of resets my brain into being ok. It also just makes me feel good in the moment.

selfharm,fej856s,t3_ep8orm,1579160982.0,"Huh. I think sometimes glue is used to close wounds, like staples and stitches. Superglue isn't medical glue, so it's probably not sterile and bacteria-free, so your skin will probably get irritated. I think you're right that it gets the job done though. I wouldn't keep doing it in the future though. Try gauze if it happens again."
selfharm,fej7co2,t3_ep9ana,1579159960.0,"When I was 14 I almost failed a class and my mom kept telling me how stupid I was. I ran to my room and took apart a pencil sharpener and used the blade to cut the top of my arm. My friend self-harmed at the time, so I think that's why I tried it."

eczema,fdl23zb,t3_eltx40,1578515738.0,"I'm not familiar with the climate of those places, but for me, humidity and types of pollen (allergens) make a difference. Dry, arid places defintely clear up my eczema. Moisture causes flare-ups."

eczema,fct3tn3,t3_eip07q,1577932160.0,"I shave every other day/ two days in the shower with a three-blade razor and EOS shave lotion. I get it in vanilla, since it's the less fragrant out of the other scents, and it's moisturizing, so it's been really helping me. I also put eczema cream on my legs after I'm done showering just in case. I used to use Bic single-blade razors, but they cut me too much and worsened my keratosis pilaris, so I switched to gillette"

I feel like I can only treat one person more special than others, or only have one strong bond with someone at a time. It doesn't feel genuine to have multiple close friends. Same goes for me though, like I get really jealous of my close friend talking to and hanging out with other friends. It makes me feel worthless and not good enough. I know it's unreasonable, but I feel like I should be enough for a friend, since having only one close friend is enough for me."

selfharm,fb3h3rd,t3_eb6diy,1576472938.0,"Yeah, because the skin is thinner there. Places where hair doesn't usually grow, like inner elbows and arms, means the skin has less layers."

This doesn't work all the time for me, but listening to really loud music, drawing on my arms, and cleaning/organizing my room is sometimes distracting enough. If you have anyone you can talk to to help you through it, maybe that can help too?"
