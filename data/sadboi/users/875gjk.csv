The primary reason for me behind quitting is I am just fed up with the idea of taking pills every single day. Plus where I live it costs insane amounts of money. I cannot afford therapy. Only medication. Which is just not the way to go about treating depression, of course...

depression,ewcau00,t3_cnmv73,1565281441.0,"And yes, by the way, there are different types of depression and different stages of it. There are some perfectly functioning individuals out there who have it and it's hard to notice unless you know a person well. And there are those who can't leave the house too. And there are those who put on a smile and there are those who look like a trash. Just take your kid to the doctor, lady, if you love him/her, care about her, do it. Leave your selfishness behind! I've been through depression and my family also didn't accept this fact and some members of it don't accept it till now, even after years that I have been doing therapy and taking prescription medications. I am angry at your mom with you. Just hang in there. You are not alone. Text me if you want to vent."
depression,ewca5ln,t3_cnmv73,1565281086.0,"Your mother is misinformed and possibly in denial. As it might be making her feel like a bad mother: ""my child got a depression, what was I doing wrong to so it led to it, am I a bad mother?"" So she might be experiencing some guilt and trying to just get rid of it by saying your depression is superficial. If you can, try and quit proving it to her. At the end, you are the master of you life. Only you can help yourself. But I do know how much it sucks to feel like your family doesn't believe you or belittles your feelings. Try to find some support online or through your friends. If you can, go to a good psychologist. And then later on, perhaps that psychologist can explain to your mother more about your state. And maybe she will turn more understanding. I can't promise. But you can't give up on yourself."

To be honest, so many guys around who aren't capable of acknowledging their own feelings, they are just blind. I am not implying you are one of them, but take a second and look into yourself: what is a true motif behind you texting her? I wouldn't help myself but be very suspicious and sad if I were in your girlfriend's shoes. Imagine if she had a ex husband, and she texted him when you guys had a fight. And then added him on social media and started chatting and sending pics. That would be very disrespectful towards you and your relationship and very low."
