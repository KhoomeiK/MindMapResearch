Amd,fqck0l9,t1_fqcdygt,1589260241.0,"I think many believed that B450 will support Zen 3 and used that belief to decide the purchase of the current system, or worse, gave advice to others. And now when things turn out not as what they predicted, they blamed AMD. I agree that the BIOS problem used to back the decision to drop support for older chipset is garbage, but to be honest, AMD didn't make any claim that 400 series chipset will support Zen 3.

AMD is not innocent in this case. B550 should be available nearly a year ago. If it's there, people didn't have a single choice for budget systems which is B450."

Amd,fq9hua8,t3_ghkbq1,1589198689.0,I have used AMD for more than 20 years and saw many chipset/socket changes in that period. The reactions from users this time is so weird. It has never been like this before. Sometimes we need to leave something good behind for something better in the future. Everything has its own ending. Take it easy.
Amd,fpxhpp3,t3_gfws07,1588982847.0,"Support for AM4 has to come to an end sometime. Now, look at the fact that it is here only for another CPU generation. Everyone who buys Zen 3 is stuck with AM4 without any upgrade path no matter what chipset is on the motherboard. To be honest, it is not the B450 or B550 compatibility problem. You can't ask for the backward and forward compatibility forever. AMD has done a very good job for AM4 longevity. Don't blame them for that.

For AM5, or whatever it's called, I think AMD will tell how long it will be supported.

There is one thing I agree, why B550 is too late, and it raises the B450 problem. AMD has had to unveil it by the time Zen 2 came."

football,focy0jk,t1_focr2pb,1587677375.0,"OK so it's now clear one of the things that you want to read from me (he's offside, or not).

I also think that I specified the answer from my initial post. Just in the way you misunderstood. I don't say it's your fault. Just misunderstanding.

For clarifying, ""it still applies"" means ""the law of 2 still applies in this specific case - the case stated by the thread starter"". So offside or onside? I think it's clear enough.

One thing you said and I agree, is that the rule is clear. But I don't think because it's clear then nothing to be discussed. If you think so, no discussion in this topic is necessary.

Why do I have to be so specific on concluding the player is offside or not when I just want to put a comment on the cases listed by the rule? Maybe if my response is the only reply in this topic, it's not appropriate. But it's not. I wrote the comment in relation to other comments in mind."
