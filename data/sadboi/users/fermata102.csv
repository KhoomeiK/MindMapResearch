ExNoContact,fr5il25,t3_gm9k0f,1589909148.0,Yea I’m already doing all these things. It ain’t helping. I worry that maybe this no contact thing isn’t healthy. I hate that society thinks this is conventional wisdom. What if we’re wrong you guys
ExNoContact,fr3lw1s,t1_fr2goe0,1589860303.0,Yea. I just Can’t believe he froze me out during a pandemic when we all need people

Don’t be a dick about breaking their hearts."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fqe83ef,t3_gi8wkr,1589303290.0,"Unfortunately, it’s not a lie. It’s just a shitty truth. That it is shitty doesn’t make it false. Men give to those women who don’t ask because they want to be a knight in shining armor and feel an ego boost of hero worship. If you ask, they find you a “nag.”

Do men suck? Ummmm yes. Is it reality? YES! 
Just because you dislike something doesn’t make it go away. It makes me sad. All the time. Because men leave me when I’m too “needy,” a “nag” or some other shitty spin on what I simply see as communication."

Then blocked me for silly petty shit two months into this current beau. Sooo I feel ya. It’s so goddamn painful. This pandemic makes it sooo much harder too.
BreakUps,fqayut5,t3_g1gfoc,1589227643.0,"Yea but. Like. If he’s moved on and has a new girlfriend and he doesn’t treat her like shit - isn’t that me? Aren’t I the variable? He clearly didn’t want to treat me well. He didn’t like me enough. He is sooooo into her. 

How is it NOT my fault? He wrote me an email outlining every detail of just how it was my fault. Then blocked me. Didn’t even give me a chance to respond. I couldn’t even apologize if I wanted to, let alone argue with him which is what he was avoiding."

We got into ONE “fight” (wasn’t even a fight; it was me asking to text me an updated ETA if he was running late or that if he had to cancel plans, let me know ... and even try to rain check - don’t just bail)
He then told me I caused too much conflict and that his other friends are more understanding when he flakes on them and they don’t criticize him. Well he doesn’t actually flake on other people so there’s another reason. But I’ll never get to know what the real reason is."

That’s not what’s happening here AT ALL. It’s neither helpful nor does it even offer any sense of camaraderie given that there is nothing in your story analogous to mine. Way to make it about your life that is not even a little similar? I guess I appreciate that you’re trying to connect by sharing your life story?

relationship_advice,fq76u9z,t1_fq766i5,1589142539.0,"So this is the first time actually posted in this sub Reddit instead of just being a voyeur… I am a little disappointed with how many responses I have received that aren’t actually answering the question I asked. 
I’m really not interested in anyone’s opinion regarding whether or not I should desire to stay friends with my exes. 


My question specifically was for advice/ coping mechanisms for somebody who froze me out unexpectedly for no good reason. I gave the history for context but frankly it doesn’t really matter whether this guy is an ex-boyfriend or not. I’m struggling because someone I cared about cut me off without warning."
relationship_advice,fq6kpha,t1_fq69qz5,1589133385.0,TLDR - but I read enough to see you didn’t actually answer my question. I asked for advice on how to best cope. You’re just criticizing my personality and my life philosophies. NEXT.
relationship_advice,fq6kjwm,t1_fq63knc,1589133302.0,Thank you. Yes I’m Trying to. I’m wondering - how to forget? I have flashbacks all the time. They’re quite disturbing. It was so unexpected out of nowhere. And so extreme!! He couldn’t just say “hey here’s what I’m gonna need from you moving forward” - he had to cut me off?! Like. We were FINE just 5 days before he did this.
relationship_advice,fq6k89r,t1_fq63cko,1589133126.0,"I did not extract anything. You’re making assumptions. He promised that of his own volition. And he meant it. I was skeptical quite frankly. And I told him so. And then he doubled down. It was really moving actually. And honestly - nobody would be OK with how inconsiderate he was. I didn’t make demands. He was rude multiple times. For example - he had AN ENTIRE WEEK to reschedule our Saturday plans. In fact, I checked in with him on Tuesday just to make sure it was still on and he said “yup!” 

Then when he didn’t show up, texted “hey is everything ok?” ... I checked his Facebook page and he was doing just fine and clearly was near his phone and posting (or computer - he receives texts there too) sooo he didn’t respond to my texts at all. Not even to say “hey can we take a rain check! Sorry!”
This response is actually really mean and victim-blamey when what I was asking for was advice."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fq1anbr,t1_fpzk5tm,1589043856.0,"That’s not what I meant at ALL. 

What I mean is - because we all have hundreds of thousands of likes, we will never seriously consider any one of them. We will probably never meet up in person with a lot of men who may have actually been amazing for us. Because we have so many options we have to arbitrarily filter out some.  If we actually had fewer options we would be more open minded and maybe even find the one."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fpybn67,t1_fpy75x1,1589000641.0,There’s a really good radiolab episode on the allusion of freedom with choice. Human beings actually tend to thrive when decisions are already narrowed down for us.
FemaleDatingStrategy,fpy6rea,t1_fpy2em6,1588997239.0,But it actually works in their favor because the apps force them to make a decision. It’s easier for them to have success in this way
FemaleDatingStrategy,fpo4bbp,t3_gei96d,1588778128.0,It’s because women want a life partner and men want a “companion”... aka a pet. Men just want pets they can fuck. Women want someone they can share their life with.
aww,fpo40k4,t3_gefmwu,1588777977.0,Awww. Cats are just like humans :) ... except that the human would leave it’s friend and want plaudits forever for helping and then consider it a burden if the anxious scared-y cat got nervous ever again. Which it obviously totally will.

Love is weird. There’s no rhyme or reason to it. I want to believe time will heal it though because ... well. This fucking blows. This is not the good kind of live that makes you giddy and see the world as roses and rainbows. This is the sucker punch you in the gut kind of Love that makes it hard to get outta bed every day. 
Everyone is all sad during the pandemic cuz the stuff of life that keeps us going.  Family. Children. Spouses. Pets. I tell you what though. They ought to be happy they have those things. Unrequited love during the pandemic is WAY WORSE than reciprocal love that simply can’t be cultivated.
