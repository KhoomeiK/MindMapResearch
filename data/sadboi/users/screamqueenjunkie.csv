John‚Äôs choices were unique because they just so happened to be broadcast for the whole world to see, hear, or read about. 

As you move on in life, you‚Äôll realize that most people would not be able to withstand the constant scrutiny. No one is immune to terrible decisions. No one could handle their lives being examined under a magnifying glass. Anyone who says they could is an outright liar.

John was also unique in the sense that he was upfront about each and every one of his faults and shortcomings. He loathed himself for many of them. Most of these are right in his lyrics. It‚Äôs all there. *Getting Better*, *Run For Your Life*, and *Jealous Guy* are only a few examples of this.
