I also saw the world with rose colored glasses on at that age, i believed the lies and half truths I was told.  I can tell you death isn’t a “bad” thing since you can only assign value to existence while you are a conscious being. You can assume my life will get “better” just like I can assume that you’re on this forum to give your life some sense of value, or just to inflate your ego if only for the moment.  However you are correct in your assumption that I don’t 100% want to die because obviously I’m still alive but, if you just looked at my post history you can tell that majority of me doesn’t want to participate in this society with the beliefs, habits and overall personality/ work ethic that I have."
