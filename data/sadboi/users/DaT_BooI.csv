My childhood dog had to be put down about a year ago and I still cry but two things I remember are we made them as happy as they made us and that he isn't in pain anymore. I can tell that you must have been an awesome owner just from how you've taken the loss and I hope you can feel a little better. I am sorry for your loss.

No your not weak because you can't admit to your mom that your self harming or having issues.
It isn't easy to tell her. I couldnt someone else did. And I got a doctors appointment and therapy and things got better. But you don't have to tell your mom to get all that shit you can get it on your own if you have the money (if you live in the States).

As for why. Does cutting your legs hurt more idk man it just does.

I understand where your coming from here and I want you to know that things will get better. Its not easy but zthe first step is always opening up to someone doesn't have to be parents it can be anyone who you trust."

I did and it worked for me. Therapy is the best thing I ever did because it gave me coping mechanisms and taught me the importance of recognising when things aren't going right. I think it's worth a shot if your willing to be open and honest. It takes time is the point I'm making and right now your at the start of the pain.

AskReddit,f0gf2ar,t3_d4tsbd,1568598563.0,"For me I tried to avoid talking about it at home and talking about it in general because I couldn't handle it.

I couldn't avoid talking about it for much longer so I told someone and that also helped but that was because I was ready pretty much. 

So what I'm saying is talk about it with someone when your ready obviously make it someone you trust and someone who doesn't mind listening and who is good at listening. 

In terms of handling work in school or college or university try talking to a trusted adult about having time off from school. I never took the time off but it's good too know it's there and their willing to offer it and ask if theres anywhere on campus that you can go if your feeling down and want to be by yourself. 


Don't be afraid to cry or realise your emotions whatever you need to do. 

The most important thing to remember is to take care of yourself. Eat, sleep, drink water and shower. It's not easy especially in the morning when you just want to lie in bed away from everything but you have too."
