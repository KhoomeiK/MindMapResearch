depression,flirzi7,t3_fovx5x,1585189302.0,"It's like my emotions are chemical reactions to what's happening around me without being connected to my true self. Even if I'm having fun and feeling joyful, there's this distance from how my body reacts to how I feel on a deeper level. I know everything's actually awful and it clashes with how I feel when I'm out having a good time. All the conditioning to appear healthy and normal just makes me feel more fake. It never feels like I'm in a place where I can be my true self. Like no matter where I go, I'm just going to be a vessel for whatever place I'm going to."

Never been in a relationship or had a lifelong best friend. It's hard being open with all my thoughts, and I know a lot of people would just reject it. I don't know what to do about it.

In my opinion, everyone's growing and we'll never be perfect, so you don't have to reach a certain benchmark for someone to love you. You're more likely than not perfect for someone just the way you are. Doesn't mean you shouldn't stop growing, especially if it helps you find the person you're looking for. But I don't think it could be too early."

It's bizarre how there's people like you and people like me in our schools, and we somehow can't manage to make friends with any of them. I wish things were simpler and straightforward. Something that'd work for the both of us. (Hug)"
