This one time during an office aid period, these two guys came in, and i was just drawing while they were talking to these other aides like me. I gave off loner/shy vibes because i had my hoodie on and pulled the strings to cover my face a bit. Well one of the guys came over to me and was like ""what are you drawing??"" I obviously didn't want to talk to him because he was with someone i didnt like (long story short, he was an old bully of mine) and i covered my drawing. Well, he thought it would be nice to take the paper anyways and be like ""omg aRe yOU dRAwiNg piKaChu??"" I never felt so embarrassed in my life.

And then this one time, (same class period) I was walking alone to another class to collect work for students in ISS, and there was this group of 5 guys walking towards me. Well, one of them tried to fake trip and fall towards me, but because of my ""i have a feeling this might happen"" i moved away from him so he wouldn't hit me. Another embarrassing day."
