COVID19positive,fme1xk6,t3_ftzd45,1585986008.0,"I'm having the diarrhea (worsening for 3 or 4 days) and tiredness and fatigue for a while now, can't say exactly how long. Temperature has only been up to 99°F so no real fever. I had a minor exposure before quarantine began, but no cough + no fever = no COVID test for you, little orphan Annie.

I've talked to enough COVID nurses (I have A LOT of friends in healthcare) to feel comfortable that my symptoms are consistent and I'm following their advice closely for home care. I guess with no doctor willing use a precious test on someone without a cough or fever, that's really all I can do.

It's just hard to continue working (I work remote) when I'm in the bathroom all day. I'm barely making it to meetings on time, or making it through meetings. Do you know how hard it is to schedule diarrhea? 😔 It's funny, but it's not funny. This is my life."

Based on what I read in the eConfirm and watching a few transactions to confirm, the trading windows are 9-9:30 AM EST and 4-4:30 PM EST. (Not saying the window is 30 minutes long, just that it starts somewhere around then.)"
stashinvest,fbfinsp,t3_ecyhij,1576811528.0,"I read the fine print in my first eConfirm veeeery closely and the morning trading window appears to be thereabout 9 AM EST and the afternoon window thereabout 4 PM EST.

However, I think the reason they don't publish the trading window times is that they don't stick exactly to them. I was watching my pending trade this afternoon pretty closely to try to see if I could catch when the afternoon trading window opens, and my trade processed around 3:45 PM EST.

I say all that to say, if you're being naughty like me and doing some occasional day trading on Stash, put your transactions in 30 minutes to an hour ahead of the window because Stash will switch up their times on you and ruin your scheme."

schizoaffective,f9kxvma,t1_f9k1lbv,1575410095.0,"I can't help much with the alogia and adhedonia. However, lack of concentration/motivation and will to do anything (even taking care of yourself) are big ones for me and I have some hacks.

First, I use this app called Fabulous: Daily Motivation. It's hard to explain what the app is, but here's a little blurb from their app description:

> Fabulous is not just your average habit tracker! We’re a science-based app that will motivate you to improve your fitness & achieve your weight loss goals, reboot your sleep cycle, and discover mindfulness to reduce your anxiety. You’ll learn to build a transformative morning routine and even pick up life-changing habits like meditation and yoga along the way.

> Our ultimate goal is to instill habits that improve your health.

> Using any random habit tracker to pick up a habit like yoga, meditation, or to serve as a reminder to workout never works. This is why we’ll act as your life coach, building your motivation so you can focus on developing habits that reduce mental health issues like anxiety, and improve your daily productivity.

It is a paid app, but I think it's no more than $30 per year and I think it's worth the money. I'll send you private messages with pics of how I use the app to structure my days and keep me on a good path.

The next thing I do each morning is write an effective to-do list. I've done a lot of research on why to-do lists fail and have come up with a formula for a good one that's easy to stick to.

I make two columns. The first column is for important things that need to be done today. All of my research has shown that this column should have no more than 3-5 items. Under each item, write the first step you would need to take to begin completing that item. So if it's, ""Buy groceries,"" underneath that you write your first step, ""Make grocery list."" My research has shown that you're less likely to procrastinate if you have an actionable first step. Next, you can rank the items in this first column A, B, or C for level of importance. That way you can map your day around your most important tasks.

The second column is what I've nicknamed ""the sidequest column."" These are things you need to do, but if they don't get done today, it's okay. I find that it helps me remember my less dire, but still important tasks if I keep a rolling list of them. Any sidequest items that weren't completed today get rolled over to tomorrow's to-do list sidequest column.

Finally, I feel that concentration and motivation are highly impacted by your environment. Create a good ambiance for yourself in the spaces you spend the most time in. Clutter is not good for the mind, tidy up, organize. Change your lightbulbs. I have those cool LED smart lightbulbs that can change any color and any brightness. Red light is good for my mind, so I often switch my lighting to red. Consider an essential oil diffuser or scented candles for some intense aromatherapy. Make your spaces places that make you feel good."

So of course I was angry and devastated. I did self destructive things because I don't know how to cope with my feelings, as per usual.

We didn't speak most of Thanksgiving. We put our feelings aside to attend my high school reunion as a couple on Friday. Had a good time, but we ended up bickering again because we never made up from Wednesday. We went home together, but he slept on the couch.

Finally made up on Saturday and spent the rest of the weekend together in bed. Cuddled, watched a million movies, ate in bed."

I also keep Campbell's Chicken & Wild Rice on hand. Whichever Campbell's soup that's your favorite will work.  It's a very light meal and a small portion, so that's another thing that I can get my brain to eat in lieu of a real meal."
schizoaffective,f8x94i8,t3_e2b8iy,1574911712.0,"So I'm certainly not speaking to you as a doctor here, I'm speaking as one sick person to another, and I definitely think you should run anything I suggest by your doctor first if you decide you want to try it.

I take Latuda as well and like to take it at bedtime due to side effects. I also know that you need to take it with food for absorbtion reasons. However, I also suffer from disordered eating so I often cannot make myself eat a meal in the evening, especially if I ate lunch. So, one of my cheats is low-sugar meal replacement shakes. For some reason I can get my faulty disordered eating brain to drink a meal, but not eat one. I don't know why, but it works.

Anyway, obviously this is not ideal. And I don't suggest that you skip dinner, just have the shake (or half of it, you don't have to drink the whole thing) as well at bedtime to take your Latuda. Run it by your doctor though."

This tends to be worse for me when my stress/anxiety is high or my schizoaffective disorder is acting up, and I lose a noticeable amount of weight, and people are all like, ""Wow you're so tiny! What's your secret?"" And I wanna just be like, ""Severe mental illness lmao. It ain't glamorous."""
