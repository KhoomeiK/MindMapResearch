Traditional Christians tend to believe in a very light version of Abrahamic religion that isn‚Äôt terribly rigid and is based in period appropriate information for when their scriptural texts were written. Most of the Old Testament probably did not happen, but at the very least what‚Äôs presented is appropriate. It all has its uses. The core message of Christianity as a religion is Jesus was a chill bro, therefore you should be a chill bro too. Most people that practice Christianity practice a very superficial version of it that isn‚Äôt taken to any logical extremes. It‚Äôs convenient  

Mormons believe in Bible 2: Jesus goes to America, wherein all of the historical information given is 100% fictitious and very VERY easily shown to be such. It‚Äôs very rigid, and doesn‚Äôt allow for very much deviation because the religion itself has social and monetary requirements to practice it. Trad Christians will not usually sit you aside, ask you prodding questions about whether or not you masturbate, and decide your spiritual future based on that. Mormonism will. Trad Christianity doesn‚Äôt usually require tithes to complete religious rites. Mormonism does (though the enforcement depends on what temple you‚Äôre at). 

That‚Äôs an incredibly reductive way of explaining this, because there‚Äôs a LOT of theory behind it, and it makes for fascinating reading. Christianity has the pleasure of its scripture being written ages ago, so you can hide behind whether or not something was appropriate to the time it was written. The Book of Mormon was written in the early-mid 1800s and therefore doesn‚Äôt enjoy that kind of convenience to hide behind."

It‚Äôs terrifying. We actually have a bunch of CERN guys at my college, one of which is the professor for that class. He‚Äôs also our dean, and also our head of research. Nural Ackchurin is his name, and he‚Äôs a very kind, understanding, terrifying man. 

And I haven‚Äôt taken quantum yet. Just an intro to it. Nor have I taken the math required for the course. 

And I managed to at least sort of understand what I‚Äôm talking about. 

I‚Äôve been fretting about it for a week because my lab partners decided I had to present alone, since I was out with strep the week before. It‚Äôs been a long stressful week!"

I‚Äôm getting a couple more tetras soon so the school is fuller. Not seen is also a neerite snail, and a little tiny pleco. :) 

I really adore crow tail and orchid bettas. I‚Äôm super happy he lived. When I got him he was having a really bad time at a PetSmart."

I NAILED MY PRESENTATION YESTERDAY! TAKE THAT LAB PARTNERS! 

WHOOOOOOOOO!!!

I wanna thank everyone who gave me some encouragement a couple of days ago. I managed to learn a bunch of quantum in like a week in spite of the fact that I‚Äôve never taken a quantum class. 

I appreciate y‚Äôall. So so much. :)"
