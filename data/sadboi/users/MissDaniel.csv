Step 2 is doing supply work in childcare centres while you are still a student. Provided you do well in your placements, those locations are great opportunities to do supply work because they will have all your paper work and no need to train you!

Step 3 is registering with the college of ECEs which you can do all l once you have your diploma.

As to whether you should go into this field, that's for you to decide. It's a rewarding one, a fast paced one, and an interesting one. I've loved my ECE career.

I ended up picking Jergal, the scribe of the dead, as his deity.  Evil and death focused, but more passively.  I think being hands-on with the picking the God and understanding exactly how that will influence the PC's interactions with people (mine was cold, distant, and buried the dead after every combat encounter) you should be able to avoid some potential nonsense.

Why?  Because it's something that women are supposed to do.  With this being their only support, they go into this field.

When I was taking my ECE diploma, I did so in night school part-time.  Most of the women I was studying with were newcomers to Canada.  Whether because of culture, or because of their family, this was the only thing they were allowed to study, and the only workplace outside of the home they were allowed to work at.

Not everyone who works in the field of ECE really did make the choice to work in it.  For many, the choice was made for them.  Ours is a poorly paid, female dominant, often racialized field.  While there are certainly some who choose to enter the field because they are passionate about working with children and family, always remember that there are those who are working in this field out of necessity, or lack of better option."

I will say that the positive interactions vastly outweigh the negatives.  I have 0 regrets about my chosen field.  

One thing I will say, though, is that as a male ECE you will have to work twice as hard as everyone else: some will think you're amazing because you've chosen this field and you need to prove them right, others will wonder what's wrong with you and you'll need to prove your worth to them.

No, I don't really feel like going out right now.  
No, I don't want to have people over.  
No, I will not work over time.  
No, I can't help you with your problems right now.

That doesn't mean becoming a  disagreeable hermit.  It means I know that when I'm depressed I don't want to socialise, entertain, do more work than needed, or fix other people's problems... but I have problems saying so because it seems way too hard.  Usually I just want to curl up with a book and read.  For me my depression -usually- lasts  a couple of weeks at a time (though it has been months/years in the past).  

You need to stand up and say what it is you need, and sometimes that means saying 'no'.  Also, saying 'no' is very different than ghosting.  If you don't want to do a thing or see people, make sure you say 'no' rather than just not saying anything at all.

I tell him the same thing I would tell you in this situation: we all made the best decisions we could with the information we had at the time.

Start running!
BipolarReddit,f1jsazc,t3_d9mfhf,1569527300.0,"I went to university when I was 19, had a long manic episode, and failed out of two separate schools.  I didn't go back to school till I was 26.  When I was manic the first time I did all the things you shouldn't do.  Like... all of them.  

Since then I've managed to get a college diploma, a B.A., and an M.A.  I was manic for certain periods during this, had depressed during the final semester of my M.A., but academically did very well.

Couple of things:

\- Don't pull all nighters.  Plan your work out ahead of time.  Be smart with your assignments.  Succeeding at school is far less about being smart and far more about being organised.  If you feel like you need to do extra work/something isn't ready to be handed in... find out what the late penalty for handing it in late is and just hand it in late.  If it's something like 5% per day, weigh that against potentially triggering mania by having an all-nighter.

\- Take less courses.  When I went back to school I took 1 less course each term, then 2 courses over the summer.  It meant I was always doing work, but having 4 instead of 5 classes really helped.

\- If you get the feeling in the first week or so that a course is going to give you big problems, drop it like it's hot.

\- If you haven't registered with whatever office/department helps students with special needs... do it.  It can take a while to get into the system.  Even if you never need to use the supports, you will have them available to you

\- Talk to your profs/department heads BEFORE you're manic.  That way you're at least on their radar, and if something happens and you need help/support they'll already know part of the story.  When I'm either manic or depressed I really really suck at reaching out and asking for help."
BipolarReddit,f1jqi7n,t3_d9nmse,1569526596.0,"I've been burnt out before, and I've burned myself out before (it's super common in my field).  I actually wrote an entire article about what to do when you burn out, but I think it applies more to teachers than it does to scientists ;)

Biggest suggestion I can give is re-discover a hobby and make time for it... because it's important.  You need time to do things that are not work.  You need time to give your brain a rest.  You need something that you can look forward to.  The last time I burned myself out that was weekly D&D sessions.  I cannot tell you how much it helped.  Find something you used to love doing it... and make time for it.  If there isn't really anything, then discover something new.  D&D, reading, hiking, or writing abstract poetry are not going to turn back burnout, but they will help balance you out and give your brain something OTHER than the work/sleep/eat grind that we can so easily get into."

BipolarReddit,f0souu7,t3_d62tyw,1568908314.0,"I've bombed out of 3 universities, and then successfully completed a college diploma, a B.A., and an M.A.  Here's what I did differently the 2nd time compared to the first time:

\- Don't do all nighters.  Just don't.  Make sure you sleep.  Resist the temptation  
\- Get in touch with whatever organisation provides accomodations and get them.  Use them.  Their base level of support tends to be extended deadlines and longer test periods, which you may not need, but you'll be very thankful to have them when you need them.  Make sure you jump on this ASAP, because it can take a while to get accomodations  
\- Speak with your department head.  Sometimes they have access to resources (especially crisis resources) that students do not normally have access to.   
\- Speak with professors for specific classes if you feel it will help.  Be pro-active, introduce yourself, say that you have a condition that you may require support for throughout the semester.  That way at least they will have a face to attach to the panicked 3am email.  
\- If you can take a reduced courseload, do so.  I always took 1 less course each term then took two courses during the summer term.  It really really helped.  
\- Don't stress if something happens and now isn't the right time for you to finish your degree.  I flamed out of two schools in my late teens/early 20s and I thought I had ruined my chance at an education.  I went back to school when I was 26 and I accomplished so much more than I ever thought I would.  The house isn't on fire, the schools will all still be there, you have plenty of time.  I now work as a professional in my field and regularly write and attend conferences.  Took me a while to get here, but I did it.  It may take you a while, too, but you will do it."

I now can't pull any money at all from my savings account unless I set up an appointment and speak with him.

the word of God  
says so right at the beginning of the verse  
He said I have gone off the deep end

ECEProfessionals,ezwqgzx,t3_d2qkpv,1568222683.0,"That sounds incredibly frustrating, demoralizing, and exhausting.  I can't imagine the stress you're going through in your classroom.

Unfortunately, unless the parents want to open that door, you can't force them to walk through it.  I've worked with plenty of parents who have had the same reaction, and it's often because of fear and guilt.  Fear that their child is going to be labelled with someone that is going to follow them and ruin their lives.  Guilt that this is somehow their fault and they did this to their children.  Neither is logical, but the parents were acting through a place of emotion.  It can take a while for parents to come around.  In my experience families like this do know, but fear and guilt are extremely hard to overcome.

You have to meet the parents where they are.  If they refuse to hear anything about autism (which, honestly, isn't really our place to diagnose) then don't talk about it.  Talk about this child's behaviour at the end of the day just like you would any other child.  Talk to them about the struggles you're experiencing, and if they can provide any help/support without using the A word."
BipolarReddit,ezwl5zu,t3_d2pdzj,1568219215.0,"If you've been contemplating getting accommodations, I would suggest just biting the bullet and doing it.  Find out how it works at your school, be it through a resource office or through your department.  You may never ever need it.  But it's good to have when you do need it.

I failed out of two schools when I first tried to go away for university.  And when I say failed, I mean FAILED.  I flipped my day/night cycle, stopped sleeping completely, did things that I didn't even know sheltered little suburban me were capable of... it was a lot.  I wasn't diagnosed, and we had no idea at the time.  When I went back with support I accomplished a diploma, BA, and MA all in about 5 years.  But it took close to 10 years to undo the damage my first two complete flame-outs caused.

Two pieces of advice: 1) Don't pull all-nighters.  Your work will suck.  I used to work till about 11/12, then get up at 6 to keep going.  2) If you feel like you are spinning into a crisis, speak with your faculty director.  They often have access to emergency resources for students in crisis."
