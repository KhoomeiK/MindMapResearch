Thetruthishere,eujagqe,t1_eu0v0ht,1563866615.0,It's just a type of butterfly
Thetruthishere,etz5lmz,t3_cdu5vn,1563327241.0,"When you started describing the butterfly thing, a butterfly enter to my bedroom and flew over the laptop lol.

Butterflies have different meanings. It depends on the color, they can warn you about the weather. If you are doing a ritual or something, they can be a signal that it actually worked. Is pretty curious the fact that it guide you and warned you, though. Also, they are a signal that something has changed/is going to change. 

According to the Irish legends, butterflies are associated with the human soul and they are considered bad luck because they carry children's souls. They also appear on the ""dealan-dhe"", that is the fire of the gods during the Wiccan ceremony Beltane (Autumn/Fall). They can easily pass from this world to the next.

According to the Ancient Rome and Greece, the deity Psyche was named after the soul. Butterflies represent transformation.

The Luna moth represents spiritual growth, wisdom and intuition.

I hope it helps!"
