Shitstatistssay,fo07wa1,t1_fnzw6b0,1587407623.0,"UBI is doable if... You take it from $2000 to $1000, means test it beyond a certain income threshold (say $150k/year), exclude children, exclude people on disability and Social Security, increase income taxes on the rich, but probably also some sort of national sales tax or VAT. 

Basically what Yang proposed.

I think all of the inflation worries people have about UBI are ungrounded, except when it comes to housing. There is such limited supply and so many constraints on creating new supply that I worry any UBI would immediately get sucked up by landlords."
