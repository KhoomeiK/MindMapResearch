This stuff will rob you of relationships and career just like any addiction. It's not your fault. Try not to trade one addiction for another as this is a very easy mistake. You say you're young. Don't look at this as a negative! You twigged on quicker than some that this is a problem. If you let this drag on and rob you of more years, that would be a sin.

But I think you want to direct your attention towards your kratom use. I am an experienced kratom user and used it daily for several years and let me tell you, this stuff has some pretty brutal withdrawal and causes all manner of mental health problems when you use it daily for a period of time. Head over to r/quittingkratom to see what I'm talking about and you will have your eyes opened. Doesn't have nearly 10k subs for no reason.

I should also mention that Lyrica and Gabapentin are really not much different from phenibut. So if you're using these on off days, you're still dealing with the same receptors as phen. These two drugs are pretty brutal also. Don't mean to make you worry but I had a bit of a Lyrica problem too and I had to get off it. Take your time with this and get off one thing at a time. Taper the gabapentin, drop the phen and then taper off the kratom for a smoother landing."

There's a guy here Greg who did a super slow taper over some months and has found it manageable while juggling life's commitments. You could CT but you will likely need time off work and you won't be close to 100% for a few weeks. This is fucking tough when you're trying to hold down a job. I got promoted and started a new job after 7 days of CT and it was horrible. But it was extra stressful having to meet new people and learn complex work while withdrawing and feeling like a useless, unproductive piece of shit. You might be okay if you just pretend you are sick. I had 2 months of PAWS in that quit but I was dosing high. My quits since then haven't been anywhere near as bad. Sober is very scary and strange at the beginning but after a week or two, it's fucking great and so much better than being hooked on kratom every day. The benefits are definitely worth it. You will get your drive back, be able to sleep naturally, sex drive skyrockets, testosterone levels out and you can train harder and you just find joy in life again that kratom dulls out.

Took me a while to finger the kratom and this forum was a great help in doing so. I kept saying ""It couldn't be the kratom. It's natural. It's like coffee"" I'd probably still be on it if it wasn't for this place. Scares me to even think about that. So happy you managed to get free of this shit man and life is looking up for you now!

The brain needs to heal naturally and introducing other brain altering chemicals into the mix has never paid off for me. Sober is the only way forward with maybe the occasional drink or blowout a couple of months out. To get you through that horrific first week, maybe it's okay to use some non habit forming meds. It's all too easy to become dependant on something especially when you cease taking it and everything hits you full whack. Making exercise a daily or at least 3x a week habit is a must.

I mean, I've had anxiety before kratom but this anxiety was so bad I think we need to come up with a new name for it. It's definitely not your run of the mill anxiety.

Depending on your duration of use and daily dosage, withdrawals can vary. Count yourself lucky you didn't let it drag on any longer.

I'm on a knife edge and I cannot afford to be going on alcohol and drug binges because I just cannot handle the depression, anxiety and mental destruction that comes with it.

That's also a big challenge for me. I depended on kratom for all these big social events and to give me a calm disposition beforehand but I'm having to unlearn all that now and regain some very fundamental social skills.

quittingkratom,evsa8x1,t1_evqo3ep,1564737481.0,"I quit a few times in the past. When it gave me a panic attack, that made it easier to turn my back on it. I'm off it again now a good while. It was just way too destructive and robbed me off too much time."
quittingkratom,evqeby7,t1_evqavqq,1564691369.0,I've had this happen me after dosing kratom in the past. Total disconnect from reality/panic like some kind of nightmare bad trip. Scared the hell out of me.
stopdrinking,evq8ibm,t1_euezc50,1564688522.0,"Of all the drugs, alcohol is the one they glamourise and make legal. It is one of the most destructive poisons known to man. They say weed is the gateway drug. Bullshit! Alcohol is it cos your inhibitions go out the window and you'd try pretty much anything while intoxicated. It's a shit buzz for starters and the hangovers are traumatic."
stopdrinking,evq7uaj,t3_cfzmmw,1564688140.0,"Alcohol is a terrible drug. I binged my way through my teenage years and early adulthood. Sometimes I drank every day, even in the morning before work to kill the after effects of the previous night. I felt guilt and shame for days by the way I conducted myself and made so many mistakes. I am the nicest guy you could meet sober, but I turned into a monster with alcohol. There were no rules. I thought I was he man. I hardly ever drink nowadays. When I do, it cam sometimes end in a blowout and I am reminded how shit the poison really is. That fucking sense of impending doom, anxiety, depression and knots in your stomach. I don't miss it one bit. I might just cut it out completely I don't enjoy it at all."
quittingkratom,evnjink,t1_evm2lk1,1564626175.0,There comes a time when you're backed against the wall mate and you just have to fight your way out. We've all been there. It's scary at the time but once you push through it all seems rather laughable. Kratom really fucks with your head.
quittingkratom,evnj9bf,t1_evncnbd,1564626037.0,"Since I quit or during use? Since I quit, mostly mental issues that have resolved over time. Anxiety, sleep disturbances, depression, anhedonia and the like. Pretty unpleasant but what can you do?"
cocaine,evn6dfp,t1_evn3yny,1564619477.0,"I definitely need something to take the edge off. Back in the day, I could rail lines all night with no issue. Now I get crazy anxiety without alcohol or something to take the edge off. Good call brother. I think I will give the opiates a miss. I've had great success combo'ing kratom+coke in the past and it's always an awesome time but don't really fancy taking the risk with harder opiates. Not a road I want to go down. I've had two bottles of wine so I will probably drop a diazepam shortly to put this night to bed. It's been a good one!"
cocaine,evm24lg,t1_evm1ixm,1564602240.0,Coke not crack!
cocaine,evlw3f9,t1_evlvr4p,1564599990.0,Yeah and piss poor quality at that! 😂 There's a lot to be said for good old Britain.
cocaine,evluuwr,t1_evltjc7,1564599526.0,It's an expensive habit but at least we're not out in Australia.
cocaine,evltf54,t1_evlm9yi,1564598991.0,That's decent mate. £60 for me and the quality is superb. Usually it's £80 but I have a nice arrangement with the plug.
cocaine,evlt321,t3_ckb60j,1564598862.0,"Used to rail a line in the gym before a workout. Probably not the best idea, but it was a good sesh!"
cocaine,evlsxif,t3_ckalv6,1564598804.0,Looking good there brother.
cocaine,evlshj2,t1_evlod3a,1564598641.0,"Thanks bro. Opted for a bottle of chardonnay instead! But thanks for the info it will come in useful in the near future. Coke on it's own doesn't agree with me. Ain't really a stimmy person and coke definitely brings out a bit of anxiety/paranoia so it's good to have something to counter it with whether it be benzos, alcohol or ketamine. Used to mix it with kratom and that was the dream but I've since quit kratom."
quittingkratom,evl858y,t3_ck9r2e,1564591503.0,"The anticipation of it is actually worse than the withdrawal. I was more miserable, depressed and anxious when I was using it to be brutally honest. Sure you're gonna have a few shitty days when you quit, but it's a small price to pay for your life back. The depression will lift once you get a few weeks behind you."
quittingphenibut,evl6rvy,t3_ck81rg,1564591031.0,Of course you can get off it man. Slow and steady. Use some kratom to get through the worst and then drop that too.
quittingkratom,evl5yd2,t1_evl1h56,1564590741.0,"As many have said, it's not so much the physical withdrawals with kratom, it's the mental withdrawals that really fuck you. I'm scared of oxys man. If I dipped my toes in the water, I fear the current would pull me out to sea. So I'm not even gonna go there. You did so well to kick those oxys man.

Many people say day 3/4 is the worst and then it gets so much better like a cloud parts. For me, it's always day 1 and 2 that kick my ass. I bypassed the acutes last time with 1 week microdose subutex cos I don't think I had it in me to go through it again. You're almost at the pinnacle and then it's smooth sailing. I promise man it's so good when you go through the days not having to worry about drinking that shit and you start to enjoy things a lot more. I'm starting to get a little excitement back planning things and getting back into old forgotten hobbies. I'm happy for you bro and can't wait till you get out of the funk and start living your life. One final push and you're there. Best of luck man."
quittingkratom,evkhwnk,t1_evkdkk0,1564581769.0,Great job brother! The worst is over now just stay focused and handle the PAWS if/when they come. I'm not going near that shit again back pain or not! I'll smoke some herb instead just like the good 'ol days 😁
quittingkratom,evkbk7w,t1_evjnott,1564578914.0,You're doing great man. You should be proud of yourself for taking such a chunk off your daily intake. It will make quit time a lot easier when the time comes.
quittingkratom,evjgc1v,t1_evjdpcz,1564561933.0,It's definitely good man but you can get some pretty bad rebound anxiety if you use on consecutive days. I think this might be what happened in your case. I use it myself every Saturday just to give me a little mood boost when I'm going through PAWS. I've been able to have good self control with phenibut unlike kratom. Well done for getting off the kratom bro.
cocaine,evjfv3d,t1_evje4n2,1564561655.0,That gear looks superb man. Enjoy it!
cocaine,evjdrxb,t3_ck56pi,1564560460.0,That's a nice pal you got there.
quittingkratom,evjdb8u,t1_evjav76,1564560204.0,"That's pretty annoying ☹️ I'm sorry. Even some men are extremely self conscious about hair loss. I think hair loss comes about because of a lack of oxygen and blood flow on the scalp in women and with men it's more of a genetic thing. Stress can be a trigger too. Here's a good little video about a juice you can make to help with hair loss...

quittingkratom,evjcl1r,t3_cjb8r6,1564559789.0,"Yes, I've done both. Honestly, I prefer a kind of crash taper before CT. It seems to work best for me."
quittingkratom,evjcamv,t3_cjqx58,1564559613.0,"Try kombucha to help with your IBS. It's cheap as hell to make your own but super expensive to buy. The sooner you get off the kratom, the sooner you'll feel better."
quittingkratom,evjbp24,t3_ck2pey,1564559277.0,"Easy on the phenibut. It's very useful and I enjoy it, but try to keep it to once a week at the very least. Dosing on consecutive days is trouble and you don't want that."
