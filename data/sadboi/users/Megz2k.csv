My thyroid was jacked up for yearssss and I didn‚Äôt know it (neither did my docs because the labs always came back normal); but the tumors I had would cause sporadic fluctuations between hyper and hypothyroid symptoms, along with a TON of other vague ones. Like sudden, AWFUL adult-onset cystic acne; joint pain; extreme lethargy; weird rashes; extreme weight loss/gain; and many others I can‚Äôt even remember at this point. 

Thyroid and endocrine misfires will fuck your shit up. 

I doubt a doc would just write up an order for generalized/non-specific imaging studies (like full body MRIs or something)... but an unrelated MRI was actually the only way anyone knew there was a problem w my thyroid. Just coincidental. 


Also, have you had a Lyme panel? Even if it came back negative, would they be open to prescribing you a course of doxy to see if it makes any improvement? (since the Lyme tests often come back with false negatives from what I understand). I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a thing or not, but over the years I‚Äôve heard of people doctor and veterinarians doing the same even with a neg Lyme panel.  

Hopefully some of this is helpful. I‚Äôm sorry OP, I KNOW how frustrating and scary this is.
