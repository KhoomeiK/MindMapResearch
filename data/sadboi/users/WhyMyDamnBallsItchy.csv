unpopularopinion,fejrdp0,t3_ep9up9,1579183944.0,"I mean weed affects everyone differently, for some people it gives them anxiety attacks, sometimes just helps them with pain, but for some people it is literally a godsend. I spent a few years in a really dark place, i can‚Äôt even count how many times i‚Äôve tried to commit suicide, and it was getting worse and worse everyday, therapy wasn‚Äôt working, medications weren‚Äôt working, nothing was helping me at all. But when i smoked weed for the first time, i felt all the anxiety and depression and bad thoughts just wash away, i couldn‚Äôt even be sad if i tried. So i started self medicating with weed and its the best decision i‚Äôve ever made, the only downside is getting hungry and eating alot but that was a problem i had even before i started smoking. So i don‚Äôt blame the people that think its going to be a utopia if it‚Äôs legalized, because for some people its a literal life-saver. Some stoners can be annoying about it though, like the ones where their only personality trait is smoking weed, so they make their whole life revolve around it. I still think it should be legalized or at the very least medically legalized, so the people who really need it can still use it to help."
