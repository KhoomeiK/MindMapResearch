schizoaffective,fnu7yoz,t3_g3mttt,1587256411.0,We all know this. Says it on the box.
schizoaffective,fnc6ryf,t3_g0j1fa,1586829829.0,Yeah I feel I could end up alone. Oooh app idea 'Schizo Dating'.
schizoaffective,fn8lywf,t3_fzouxu,1586744696.0,"I hear a woman singing when my mind is active or when stressed. She seems unconcerned by me for now anyway. Just doing her own thing, she sounds drunk. I imagine her to be 50s or 60s and a vulnerable person."
schizoaffective,fm8lz8e,t3_ftf53l,1585851787.0,"Aw God yes. This is the hardest part of this condition, and I find it eventually borders into total paranoia about people and their intentions towards me."
conspiracy,flrvql5,t3_fqqsom,1585428876.0,"Okay, that settles it. I'm coming off my antipsychotic medication."
schizoaffective,fkrneug,t3_fka6fo,1584472271.0,I talk about it too much and I hardly talk about it at all. People don't want to know about it. 'Schizowhatever' is a term that makes people very queasy for some reason. I think we are one group that nobody cares about anywhere across the political spectrum. Unless of course it's to help their own cause.
schizoaffective,fko5abf,t3_fjhtka,1584380381.0,Sometimes I forget myself and talk about politics and how I feel afraid of certain groups. My family gets concerned.
ireland,fkj2eg2,t3_fif9y2,1584234459.0,Plot twist: The woman is giving the sanitizer to the homeless.
schizoaffective,fkg09cs,t3_fi5s16,1584146766.0,"Thanks for the responses everyone. I can relate a lot. The whole thing makes me so angry and delusional, but sometimes I reckon it is them who is delusional."
schizoaffective,fkfm87w,t1_fkflfqt,1584137533.0,Just cheap cider at the moment. But I'm buzzing for an insane bender in and out of hostels. Corvid will probably stop me though.
schizoaffective,fkfggp9,t3_fi6ilh,1584133858.0,If I had a euro for every person I wanted to sue due to this condition I could fund research for a cure for it.
ireland,fkf927r,t1_fke5mbx,1584129430.0,There's plenty of hateful bastards on the left too. Saying you're a massive leftie doesn't automatically make you a good person either. A lot of sanctimonious morons have destroyed the progressive movement IMO.
Gangstalking,fijwspo,t1_fijv55g,1582466592.0,"Were these people who they conducted the research on medicated with dopamine blockers during their lifetime?

If so that evidence is worth shit."
POETRYPrompts,fihp43k,t1_fie2w29,1582412700.0,Ok thanks. And thanks for posting the poem. It was beautiful.
POETRYPrompts,fia8fut,t1_fi9nlsj,1582295563.0,Do you have link to the music?
POETRYPrompts,fi85fzh,t3_f6tf9g,1582233803.0,"Thanks, that was good. What was the song playing in the background? It's a beautiful piece of music. Fit the poem very well."
schizoaffective,fi84zko,t1_fi81t3c,1582233560.0,"Yeah I write. It's more important to me than anything. I think my mental health team sort of know that, so they're more open minded to me taking as needed, instead of all the time."
schizoaffective,fi7v6vj,t3_f6ionk,1582228762.0,I take as needed during times of stress. Low doses to help me sleep and cool down the thoughts. I need my creativity.
schizoaffective,fi7uxsb,t3_f6wv8p,1582228631.0,I'm not sure. There's a fine line between intense hypomnia and milder mania.
schizoaffective,fhyr8gw,t3_f4y677,1581981964.0,"I rarely get them, only when stressed. It's mostly delusions, low mood and edgy 'elevated' mood."
Gangstalking,fhqxx4o,t3_f45f4r,1581813370.0,"There is no hard evidence that schizophrenic people have different brain structure. The brains they studied were subjected to heavy nueroleptic 'treatment' for the majority of their lives. Given that this class of drug has been proven to cause structural changes in the brain, it would make sense that the brains they studied would be different."
Gangstalking,fgwub3a,t1_fgv1hg7,1581165878.0,"Genuine question. What do you think will happen if we were to 'get help'? I'll tell you what, we will be detained, we will be pinned down, we will lose all autonomy of our bodies and minds, they will inject us with tranquillisers, and until we play along and pretend everything is all sunshine and lollipops we will be kept locked up.

That is literally what 'help' is. You clearly have no experience or knowledge regarding the 'mental health' system."
coronationstreet,fgko9dj,t1_fgkfjg6,1580870016.0,"Oh wow! Yes, that was it. Thanks so much! I knew it was Fair City but not so sure on the characters."
coronationstreet,fgj24o5,t3_eyqdad,1580835540.0,"Ah shit, lads. I'm an idiot. I got it mixed up. It was actually a storyline from Fair City. Long time ago. Sorry about that, and thanks to those who responded."
coronationstreet,fgj20iw,t1_fgioaoj,1580835477.0,"No it was longer ago than that.

Thanks though.

Edit: Different show completely I've now realised."
coronationstreet,fgikuwk,t3_eydvj7,1580824559.0,I hope he gets hit on the head with a big brick.

ireland,fep9fc6,t3_eq69vc,1579315106.0,"It'd be funny if they had a behind the scenes bit on the production of the video, and Leo Varadkar and the boys were actually the ones behind the masks and that's how they were spending their time on the run up to the election. Then at the end the interviewer asks 'how much did this video cost to produce?' and Leo says '100 Million Billion Trillion Euros of tax payers money', and then Leo would make this face... https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/313/234/99b.jpg"
ireland,fep8dt0,t3_eq9mm0,1579314437.0,You look absolutely terrified haha... but seriously congrats!
Psychosis,fep2dgn,t1_fep28n9,1579310590.0,Hmm... not completely. It probably dulled it a bit.
Psychosis,fep11qf,t1_fep0w5h,1579309754.0,I didn't like them personally. They made me fat and tired. I couldn't think properly.
Psychosis,feowj6q,t3_eq1ld9,1579306930.0,"On the meds I felt nothing. Off them I feel everything. Rapid switches from fear, unease, sadness, frustration, confidence, creativity etc... lots of thoughts. Sometimes the paranoia creeps in. I just try an pump it all into creativity but when the creativity dries up I get restless and feel responsible for numerous problems within the world. It's all on and off. Very unpredictable."
Psychosis,feow56r,t3_eq6a35,1579306696.0,It was probably the most tolerable out of all the ones I was on in terms of side effects.
ireland,feos7c5,t1_feons39,1579304683.0,"I'm fed up of people always throwing mental illness in as an excuse for someone being a terrible person. It's incredibly insulting for people who suffer from depression, bipolar, schizophrenia etc... that struggle through it everyday and have never harmed anyone. Not to mention it only increases the stigma of having a mental illness."
ireland,feoquwf,t3_eq1rm2,1579304206.0,I always liked foxes. They have a wise look that you usually only see in animals several times their size.
ireland,feng9d2,t3_eq1qr1,1579284034.0,If I was involved in producing that advert that mistake would annoy me so much. It would play on my mind for a long time.
ireland,fen2w24,t3_epx79x,1579275766.0,"Fair play to her, that's actually hilarious."
ireland,fen26x3,t3_eq0ibi,1579275318.0,It was something they had to do. His words will damage SF in the election. He's not cut out for politics.
