AgainstHateSubreddits,fqw0dw8,t1_fqv6yax,1589689451.0,"Absolutely right. Because of games i am able to coach a group of people i neber wpuld have met otherwise, one of which is trans, and theres never had a single issue in the team about said player. If games by themselves causing transphobia/homophobia were the issue this would not be possible

This is an issue of there being a minority of assholes who are really damn loud, who need to just shut up and get out of our communities"
Competitiveoverwatch,fqv1q86,t1_fqv0634,1589668125.0,Im arguing the org cant scout coaches/players yes.
Competitiveoverwatch,fquz6uu,t1_fqubekq,1589666788.0,When a team has mediocre perormances over 3 years then it is the org. Also GenG has not won a somgle Overwatch tournament across all theor teams
Competitiveoverwatch,fqszmnj,t1_fqszg38,1589624772.0,Whenever Orisa is banned Tracer is too. I think the Tracer is actually a more important hero as it’s the only hero Profit looks good on tbh.
Competitiveoverwatch,fqsy4i8,t1_fqsy2gb,1589623172.0,Nope. Not even contenders. They cant mamage a team to save their life. The only reason they did well last season was that mid table teams couldnt prep for them.
Competitiveoverwatch,fqsxzir,t3_gks5b2,1589623018.0,The team needs new mamagement from top down. Whoever hired the current staff and decided Profit and Gesture were the best they could do need to be fired and GenG needs to rethink their entire structure
Competitiveoverwatch,fqsxw6n,t1_fqsxqh0,1589622917.0,"Last year the barely got away with mindgaming trash teams by swapping rosters. Also look at GenG’s track record.

Competitiveoverwatch,fqsxrnz,t1_fqsxpfi,1589622781.0,What else do you expect from GenG? I dont think they won anything in OW
Competitiveoverwatch,fqsxmca,t1_fqsxhvt,1589622620.0,You even got the name wrong. Also the mansgement on this roster has been abysmal 3 seasons straight
Competitiveoverwatch,fqsxe85,t3_gks202,1589622376.0,GenG please sell the Dynasty to an org who can run an overwatch team. :)
Competitiveoverwatch,fqsx177,t1_fqsw3wc,1589621985.0,"Perhaps not a one trick, but I still stand that GenG should sell this team as they have no idea what they are doing"
Competitiveoverwatch,fqsw5ls,t1_fqsw22b,1589621045.0,They let him play torb which he fed his brains out on. He looked like garbage on echo too.

Competitiveoverwatch,fqsw2j1,t1_fqsw1ms,1589620952.0,No this season he’s been a one trick
Competitiveoverwatch,fqsvzl8,t1_fqsvxm1,1589620865.0,Have you missed all of this season? Profit has looked ass on pretty much eberything that isnt Tracer
Competitiveoverwatch,fqsvw1g,t1_fqsvsga,1589620761.0,No Illicit is useless Profit can only play Tracer. Fits  can pop but is 50/50 and GenG needs to fuck off and let a decent org take over
Competitiveoverwatch,fqsvoww,t3_gkrovr,1589620549.0,Everyone on this team besides the supports needs to be fired. Then GenG cam sell the team to an org who actually knows what the fuck they are doing
Competitiveoverwatch,fqsvlvt,t1_fqsvkbk,1589620458.0,Fire everyone besides the support line and sell the team to an org who can fucking win something
Competitiveoverwatch,fqsvjsl,t3_gkqo9l,1589620398.0,Seoul needs to fire the entire coaching staff. They have not improved on anything other than god damn Orusa Sigma. Oh and fire everyone besides Bdosin Tobi and Slime too
Competitiveoverwatch,fqpx8px,t1_fqpthca,1589555640.0,"I think Super has the better chance as he tends to appear in a ton of suplementary matirial, so OWL seems to want him to be the face"

Competitiveoverwatch,fqpnd77,t1_fqpho70,1589550292.0,Really? I did not know that. That is my mistake
Competitiveoverwatch,fqpfffe,t1_fqo9bcq,1589544993.0,Super wasnt popular S1 and more jerseys were sold that season.
Competitiveoverwatch,fqpfcsw,t1_fqorw8q,1589544935.0,I disagree. True Sinattraa is talented but I wpuld argue Super has a much more appealing persona.  His interviews are far more memorable
Competitiveoverwatch,fqnzyae,t1_fqnyf0x,1589504749.0,"NA? Yeah I agree. Worldwide i somewhat disagree I think there could be more representation of certain groups but compared to CSGO amd CoD, OWL is pretty diverse."
Competitiveoverwatch,fqnz661,t1_fqnxjnl,1589504305.0,"Here is the thing. It is harder to get invested in a player when you can’t understand wjat they are saying without subtitles. It is hard to translate slang and jokes especially when eastern lamguages phrasing may not have a 1 to 1 translation with the same effect. I can’t go into a korean player’s stream and interact with them. I cant understand their Twitter because the auto translation doesnt pick up on jokes as easily. It is a matter or being able to interact and understand them.  

I dont expect the most popular player in Korea, Europe or China to be Super"
Competitiveoverwatch,fqnuwff,t1_fqntgd3,1589501875.0,Super is pretty tame and conducts himself really well on broadcast.
Competitiveoverwatch,fqnuk5m,t1_fqns4xw,1589501679.0,??? No it’s about his personality and ease of marketablility. Its easier to market Super to english soeaking audiances because people can join his stream and understand him. It is easier to make clips or bring him on interviews as there isnt the burden of having to translate which takes up air time. Bribging Super on Watchpoint is much easier than having awkward breaks in conversations for translations.
Competitiveoverwatch,fqnqees,t1_fqnpwxy,1589499481.0,S4 is pretty vulgar
Competitiveoverwatch,fqnp7uz,t1_fqnku3b,1589498919.0,"Carpe for talent? Sure.

Personality? Super has a far more marketable personality, at least in the west. If you had tue choice of bringing Super or Carpe on for an interview, who do you think would provide better content?"
Competitiveoverwatch,fqnozzl,t1_fqnlk1f,1589498816.0,"Moth barely talks. He is too quiet to be the face of the league. Also u cant compare jersey sales as a metric of popularity leaguewide. Super became popular in season 2, wheras Jjonak and carpe have been big names since the start"
Competitiveoverwatch,fqnoide,t1_fqnlavh,1589498577.0,Honestly Sinatraa never stood out as a personality. Outside of the alien and spawncamping memes he never caught my attention as a personality.
Competitiveoverwatch,fqno2m8,t1_fqnm5hy,1589498356.0,Jjonak and carpe are igood but they arent nearly as marketable in the west as western players as the language barrier makes it harder to interact via streams/interviews.
Competitiveoverwatch,fqnnfwt,t1_fqnm49e,1589498021.0,No it’s because Super is both fun to listen to and extremely good at marketing himself via catchphrases. Also just because Smurf is better at Orisa/Winston does not make him a rein onetrick
Competitiveoverwatch,fqnkk5t,t3_gjwyh4,1589496519.0,"Super honestly is and was already poised to take Sinatraa’s place as face of the league, regardless of his retirement. I think Super was more popular even before, as you always see him in interviews and in segments rather than Sinatraa."

I’ve done the takedown at mayhem 10 with most the weapibs uve listed. Those weapons are all insanely busted and make nayhem 10 a joke anyways. 

The majority of weapons not being viable limits build variety and creates stale gameplay. Going down to the lower mayhem levels also doesnt work because once u have a mayhem 10 roll there is no point in grinding a lower mayhem roll.

A mayhem 10 breath does less then half a mayhem 5 OPQ. That is a fucking problem. It’s a looter shooter. Most legendary gear should be viable when properly annointed, period"
