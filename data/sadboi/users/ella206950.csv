Find an outlet that isn’t going to hurt you drawing, painting, sports, music, video games whatever helps you and do that instead there’s an amazing app called calm harm that gives you healthy coping skills to use when you have the urges. Get a hair tie/ elastic band and snap it on your wrist when you want to cut. Talk to someone about it. Whatever helps you not to do it.
