AnimalCrossing,fpvgum9,t3_fxy1tn,1588944474.0,This would be amazing. A simple update so I’m not dumbfounded when my tool breaks.
CoronavirusUS,fm8ui0j,t1_fm8pk67,1585856263.0,Agreed.
CoronavirusUS,fm7fm4p,t3_ft66if,1585825188.0,Guess I’ll continue to shop here. Unlike GameStop.
rarepuppers,fkkwfh8,t3_fizvlc,1584293364.0,Nice stockpile. Good girl.
blackfriday,f8jtb36,t1_f8gb2hj,1574604142.0,Ah thank you kind sir
blackfriday,f8g7fvq,t3_e04gaf,1574555324.0,Weird that Spider-Man isn’t on sale. Thought it would be $20 since GameStop will be selling it for that.
referralcodes,f7eazuf,t3_d2zx28,1573652724.0,"Hey guys, is this offer still going on? I am on the referral section of the app and it just says that I will get OYO points for inviting... how do I get the amazon points?"
blackfriday,f75d5v9,t3_du2mjj,1573414008.0,Ended up getting it through the target circle for the same price. The sale associate honored it because the signs were still up. Thanks for the help!
blackfriday,f72dptc,t1_f726jiq,1573359649.0,That’s actually one of the main things I am trying to score this Black Friday. I downloaded the app and it is still showing 29.99 is there something I did wrong?
Anxiety,ey4jsph,t3_cq2yu2,1566794824.0,"It’s like an everyday occurrence for me. I especially think about this at night when I am trying to sleep. I’ll replay stuff from that day in my head or even from a week ago. If something ever resurfaces I think about old stuff too. Work is the biggest thing, no matter what job I am in I worry about what my boss/manager thinks of me."
LifeProTips,ex1b92b,t1_evsg5f7,1565937720.0,"There’s two different types of memberships, if you want a no contract membership you will have to try to catch a deal. Usually at least one of the two memberships will be a no contract deal every month or so."
trashy,ex1b26h,t1_ex1agxr,1565937497.0,Busted my lip. I was more so pissed at the lack of basic human respect. I am a woman and he made me nervous to walk to my car that night.
trashy,ex1af3u,t1_ewxkfv0,1565936738.0,"At the PF I work at, I told a man that his 12 year old son (who wasn’t even old enough to use the gym) couldn’t use the massage chair for black card members. He threw three massage chair tokens at me. Hit me right in the mouth with them. This is some next level garbage."
trashy,ex1a4od,t3_cqkla7,1565936404.0,Planet Fitness employee here. I’m sure the poor guy told the lady she had to pay part of her overdue balance before entering the gym. People go crazy over us doing our jobs. Also I’ve seen some crazy stuff happen and I’ve only been working for PF for a few months.
riverdale,euyc81i,t3_cgsyuf,1564099409.0,Stranger Things. Has a Riverdale vibe to it with more suspense.
SCBuildIt_Classifieds,esn3d8r,t3_c86mnl,1562121590.0,I’m in! Are there still spots available?
GoodGirls,eodyowh,t3_br3qka,1558484125.0,"Especially in the scene where Beth and Dean were arguing about their marriage, she mentions how he lied about their finances (late house payments, bills, etc) but she could have also said he lied about having cancer. I feel like that’s pretty much in the same ballpark as lying about finances, but she didn’t even use that against him! Maybe they will bring it back up in the last episode. I’ve been thinking that they will finalize the divorce then and maybe she could use that against him in court when she tries to get custody over the kids (idk if they are going to court for it, just speculation)."
