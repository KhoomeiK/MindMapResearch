schizophrenia,fbx1mc3,t1_fbx1fy7,1577165868.0,"i'm sorry, deleting now. i didn't know those subs existed."
schizophrenia,fbwu244,t3_eeukq5,1577159442.0,i still feel like this while on meds lol the worst part is that i don't know if i'm actually sensing something? i'm afraid to sleep tonight but i don't wanna leave my cat alone just in case
schizophrenia,fbtva6v,t1_fbto6e4,1577097771.0,"thank you, sometimes things are overwhelming and i don't really know what else to do other than post here. i was hospitalized in feb. last year and that is sort of hanging over my head as well... i know it's a couple months off but this time of year reminds me of all that. i'm really hoping i don't get bad again around that time. i don't think i could go back to the hospital.

i hope your mom is ok, and that you can find something to enjoy in the next few days yourself."
AskAstrologers,fbjlmwh,t1_fbjabnq,1576935860.0,"no, i don't have any pisces placements myself. however my mother has a lot of pisces influence (sun, moon, chiron in the 12th), but i don't know if that would have anything to do w/ it either."
diabetes,fbc4le6,t1_fbc2c98,1576715523.0,"my father has sleep apnea. i don't know if it's genetic or not but that might explain some things. i can't sleep at all on my back for example, i have to sleep on my side otherwise i'll keep waking up. not sure if that has something to do w/ it or not?"
diabetes,fbc4esc,t1_fbc3vpf,1576715396.0,"that's a good point, i'll be sure to ask about it when i see my doctor next. thanks."
diabetes,fbbux8o,t1_fbbtf2u,1576708696.0,that's interesting. i've never noticed the same in myself--i wonder if it's very common?
diabetes,fbbuqig,t1_fbbtx3z,1576708577.0,"i've found that even when my blood sugar is in a normal range i'm still tired. then again, mine is kinda weird and will shoot up and down before i notice much difference (and then feel the side effects later). so maybe that's it."
schizophrenia,fba9p24,t1_fb9nzyy,1576671183.0,"The problem is I guess that I never know who or what to trust. Can I trust my psychiatrist? Can I trust myself? I don't even know if I believe that I've got the right diagnosis, but is that part of it anyway? And as soon as I accept it, it seems like I'm faking it and I feel fine for a while."
schizophrenia,fba9ecc,t1_fb9xv4f,1576670841.0,"Yeah I'm sorry if I don't make much sense right now. I do the same thing w/ getting worse later in the day I think, sometimes it's ok and other days it's really, really bad. Thanks for the idea btw."
schizophrenia,fb2pvon,t1_fb2ouoc,1576455504.0,No but I try to keep an open mind. I was obsessed w/ the supernatural when I was younger which probably didn't help that I felt so strongly toward them.
schizophrenia,fb2oie6,t1_fb2nzix,1576454785.0,I may try that myself. Thanks.
schizophrenia,fb2o4wg,t1_fb2n816,1576454589.0,"I feel very disturbed. I don't want to go to sleep tonight. I kind of figured that it wouldn't be movie-style, but the thought of something I can't see that wants something from me, or wants something to happen to me, i can't stop thinking about it. What do you recommend?"
schizophrenia,fb2ndim,t1_fb2mkpv,1576454194.0,"But does not believing in it mean it doesn't exist? I'm not disagreeing with you, it's just that I've tried ignoring it in the past and then this woman tells me THIS and it's just like... has it been here this whole time? Was I really ignoring it?

Most importantly should I bring it up w/ my therapist or not, b/c I don't want to get hospitalized again."
schizophrenia,fb2ms4c,t3_eb60yh,1576453886.0,"I can't hold down a job, I've tried so hard it hurts. And I can't hold relationships, friendships or otherwise, for very long at all. I'm extremely isolated and it probably makes things worse. I don't think I can live on my own either so I'll probably be stuck w/ my poor parents forver lol..."
schizophrenia,fb2lg5t,t3_eazj2x,1576453198.0,"I write stories loosely inspired by things I've seen/heard. Not in a way that other people will know that's what inspired it, of course. But sometimes if they're too disturbing to me personally I'll throw them out/burn them, even if they're not ""scary"" to other people that read them."
