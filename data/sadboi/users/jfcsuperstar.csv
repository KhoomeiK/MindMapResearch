One interaction stood out to me as particularly malicious and degrading though. This mom was tending to one of her kids in a costume and her like ten year old son was talking to her. She just turned around and said in a very hostile and firm way, ""You're always talking too much, you need to learn to shut up because people don't want to hear it."" Or something like that. I feel like it was worse than that tbh. The kid looked so... Like put down and depressed and ashamed. It was so horrible, my mouth just dropped open and I stared at them because I could not believe what I just saw. When the mom walked away, I said to the kid, ""You know that was awful of her to speak to you that way, right?? You should be able to talk. She shouldn't have said that to you."" And Jesus Christ, he just said, ""I know. She does that a lot."" This ten year old kid said that. My heart broke and still breaks for him. ;~;"

I can go vent my anger and he holds me now where before he would argue. What it took for me to get to this point in my relationship where it feels kind of perfect was being ready and able to leave him unless changes were made immediately. He's a completely different person towards me. I'm able to be there for him on another level now because he's opening up more too. We're pretty young though, 25 each, and I'm still ready to leave if it reverts back to how it was. I think that's what made the difference.

Personally though, I have no clue whether or not these people are faking. Sometimes these people they're bullying post super cringy stuff and they are definitely enjoying the attention it gets them. It really just does seem like a bullying sub though, even if the actual people kind of suck. Like mastitis can easily lead to sepsis if it isn't untreated.

Mastitis is incredibly painful and can be extremely dangerous. If an infection arises, it can hurt anyone who doesn't receive treatment because the tissue in the breast is so vascular making it a hotbed for bacterial infestation. I know of a woman who was hospitalized for a week and had major surgery to remove the infection in addition to an extreme course of antibiotics. I myself had to go on three months of antibiotics (bactrim first, where I discovered my allergy to it lol and then some other major antibiotic). Thankfully, I caught mine in time and got an antibiotic shot within 24 hours of symptoms showing and kept going when my symptoms worsened because I needed a huge course of antibiotics and not just one shot. It was the most painful experience I've ever had and it was truly terrifying for the first few days. I cried. A lot. A blocked milk duct does not equal mastitis. A blocked milk duct can CAUSE mastitis. I had an ultrasound that showed the infection was throughout my entire breast tissue and was unable to be drained because of that, hence the extreme antibiotics, otherwise I could have easily become septic and would have been hospitalized too.

Like gerbils or whatever other animal that's known for eating each other out of nowhere when you wouldn't anticipate that (not like with snakes). It dawned on me that I had never thought about how humans would behave if we were caged with someone we didn't know for the rest of our lives and if we were underfed and under stimulated, that we'd probably murder our cell mate too. So it's not a weird animal thing that just happens sometimes, it's more of a ""this environment is cute to humans thanks to the gerbil ball but ultimately it's also really toxic for me.""

  


Cyclinc back to the original comment topic, hitting an animal that's knows nothing about our culture for doing something they're not likely to do (like in OP's case- the dog didn't pee at their place but did because of another dog) just seems pointless because you can't practice consistent discipline with that anyways.
