Another trick me and my current roommate have is letting each other know EVERYTHING about what goes on in the house. It is kind of annoying to get five texts a day about menial stuff (ex: I took out the trash, you left your cheerios on the floor) but it does get rid of any passive aggressive type situation. 
Also, my roomate and I still fight. We’re both stressed and bipolar and it does lead to bickering. The trick is, when you end a dispute, you have to REALLY end it. No “yeah we’re cool I guess” or “it’s not a big deal”.  Talk that shit out, apologize if you need too, and agree to drop it.
