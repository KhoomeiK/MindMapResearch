The injuries may not be life threatening but driving over the hips of anyone results a serious injury.

On the subject of your mother, stay NC she has demonstrated she can‚Äôt be trusted and is dangerous. She appears to be delusional and should never be alone with your daughter or any other children ever again.  Make sure she is blocked on all your social media and particularly on any sites your daughter has. Cut out any relatives who may share info about you with her. 

I would not file for a restraining order at this time, it would require appearing in court with her present and presenting your reasons. 

For now stay on your path and do not contact your mother about anything.

1) no calling at work ever - unless the hospital is involved 2) no visits without a specific invitation, no letters/cards/packages, no texts, no phone calls 3) all contact will be via email, and only one per day, tell her you'll respond to her emails within 48 hours.
