PlusSizeFashion,fp2x45o,t1_fp2v8xz,1588269347.0,"Oh my god. I typed out a lengthy comment and went to hit post and hit cancel instead. I'm so mad hahaha

For context, I'm 5'7"", 270lbs, and have an hourglass figure. My weight is pretty evenly distributed throughout my body, just a little bit extra in the tummy.

Jeans. Jeans are a mystery to me. Leggings are easy as long as my top is long enough (but I never know what shape top to wear. more on that later). I currently buy an 18 usually, I love high waisted jeans because they hide my tummy, which I am self conscious about. However, the top of my jeans (near my waist) never stay up. A belt just cinches and makes me look lumpy. I have no idea what to do. They *look* like they fit that area, but they end up slipping down and looking saggy in the end, unless I hike them up a lot. I love the look of high waisted jeans and a tucked in shirt, but can't really do it because of this. What do??

Is it okay to wear spanx semi-often? I have a few form fitting shirts that I like to wear sometimes, and usually wear spanx with them because they make my black jeans fit better and my tops look smoother. It's not like every day though. I just didn't know if wearing spanx more than once in a while had a detrimental effect.

Tops and dresses are the death of me. I have a few cute dresses that I like a lot, but somehow I can't translate them to shirts. I usually wear a loose top and I know that's not doing me any favors. Like I said, I have one or two more slim fitting shirts, and I love how I look in those, but I have a hard time finding anything else like that in a plus size. I don't really know where to shop. I know that with my figure, I should be accentuating my waist, but it always seems like my boobs eat my waist stuff. They're relatively large. I just don't know what to do when it comes to tops. I don't know if I should be doing sleeveless and cardigans, or fitted tees/shirts, or loose flowy stuff. When I was thin, I dressed in a lot of form fitting stuff, but have strayed away since gaining the weight I gained over the last few years. I just want to dress in a way that will flatter my body while hiding the things I don't like to see. How do I do that?"

Coronavirus,fljmcmc,t1_fli2b38,1585218760.0,"Northeastern Wisconsin here. I had to get groceries last Friday because we were out of basically everything. We went in armed with a list and a plan to get in and out as quickly as possible. Still, the parking lot was packed, at 1pm on a Friday. We were able to get what we needed, thankfully, but there was no way we were gonna be out doing casual shopping and whatnot. So many retailers in the area were still open! I get that businesses gotta make money, but come on. 

The day before that, I heard the news about bars and restaurants doing carry out only starting at 5pm. I rolled into my seriously tiny town (made of 2 bars, a post office, and a bank) and the bar on the main street was still open. Has been open every day that they‚Äôre usually open, with many cars parked outside. I‚Äôm assuming they are risking it because we hardly ever have police come through, as we are on a county road in the middle of nowhere."
