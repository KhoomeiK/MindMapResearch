I remember looking at my hips and crying because the 'fat' wouldn't go away. One of my most vivid memories was when I was in 5th grade and I broke down crying and kept thinking ""I will never be happy with a girl body i want a boy body why wasn't i born a boy"" over and over. I found out I'm trans when i was around 12 and it explained so much. I'm 15 now, not out yet due to unsupportive family but atleast I've recovered from my eating disorders (thank God for weed) and I'm handling my dysphoria and other issues pretty decently right now.
