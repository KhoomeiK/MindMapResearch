confessions,fqzwsoq,t3_glur21,1589777358.0,"*Ramadan Highfive *

Of course its important that we always remember the less fortunate and, sure strive to be better, but also be extremely thankful Because others have less.

But as you answered your own question at the end there, it is a good thing what you're doing, vu you're also crippling yourself. You're already doing more than so many by having Compassion and thinking of others 
You can always study to make the world a better place for the less fortunate in the future, you can always give away nice warm meals to poor and homeless  people around you, especially if you feel like you have more than you need. And when there isn't a pandemic, you can invite someone over for iftar if they lack company... Etc

Use what you're feeling for the better, beating yourself up with it is not helping anyone.
And it's also important to realise that you won't be able to help every single person out there in every way, so it's important to pray for them as well

Find something you can tolerate doing for years, make sure it has a good future and won't be a job that disappears in the next 10 years, make sure it matches what you're looking for (loud and busy vs quiet and isolated, long hours with more money vs less money but more life-work balance, focused on climbing the ladder vs gives you a chance to have kids and family some day...etc) and go from there. 

Pursuit your passion in your free time and don't suck the fun out of it by making it a job

Edit: Just to clarify, yes work isn't going to be this amazing fun ride for most people, but also don't stick around in a toxic job or work environment because your mental health is important and it will directly affect your life outside of work and too."
