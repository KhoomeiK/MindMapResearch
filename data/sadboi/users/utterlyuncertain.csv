Read somewhere it was the tone or vibration of the universe. What all the sounds make together. I’m not totally convinced my human brain could comprehend or hear such a thing but maybe that’s just part of opening up different doors of perception. What a great trip that was.

It feels dystopic and ominous and I like trying to understand why there are so many antennas and all you get is static. And how you have to sew your own wounds back up with all that static. The slight emaciation is a nice touch. It’s like your mind is emaciated? It’s very lonely too. And this has nothing to do with your art really but I had a nightmare as a child where the static would come out of my television forming a static cloud and it had a spooky face and would start chasing me around the house.

[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mushroom-memory\_b\_1725583](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mushroom-memory_b_1725583)

Lionsmane is a delicious mushroom that basically helps with regenerating neurons. You can take it in pill form or liquid form. Second:

[https://beckleyfoundation.org/2018/06/13/psychedelics-promote-neural-plasticity/](https://beckleyfoundation.org/2018/06/13/psychedelics-promote-neural-plasticity/)

Just like lionsmane, psilocybin (magic) mushrooms also promote brain health/function as well as a ""trip"". And the ""trip"" I would say can help even more than the health benefits. So grab your best friend nd go to the woods and get it done if you can. Obviously, you should double check everything I am saying and do more extensive research. I am a stranger after all. But I can tell you from my own personal experience that it changed everything for me."
