One of the biggest steps of recovery is realizing that feeling bad is now your comfort zone, that you are actually not doing anything to improve and that you need to seek real help. But I hope that they realize this and get better I truly do."
depression,ep778ju,t3_btzs76,1559078193.0,"Well you can never know for sure who is really going to listen to you and help you, it is true that most of the time we are on own, that's just how life is. But don't think that you are on your own, there is people out there that truly want to hear you and willing to help, and if they aren't, you need to have the strength to seek help for yourself, cuz you deserve to be happy, but if you don't start to look for help yourself, you won't win the battle. It's a matter of staying strong and get all the help you can need."
depression,ep5hx4i,t3_btu2xi,1559056191.0,"I may be that you suddenly feel bad, it's normal for people to not feel okay all the time, but also is one of the basic symptoms of depression, sudden changes of mood even though you felt okay before. You should try to find any help to turn that around, whatever that may be. Any way I hope you feel better soon."
