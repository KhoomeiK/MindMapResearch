I went to college then got a job and everything got better, then myself mental health took a nosedive and I got fired - then I tried to kill myself again at 26.

I got proper treatment this time; got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, saw a CPN, then they decided I to refer me to a therapist for more CBT, which didn’t work again. Then a few months I got meds, which are definitely not working. My shrink now seems to think my BPD diagnosis might be wrong and that I might be on the autism spectrum and might have complex post-traumatic stress disorder. So god knows what’s happening now.
