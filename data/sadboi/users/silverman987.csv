Take New York and Washinton state for example. Both states had the first case of Covid-19 at about the same time. While the Governor of New York was telling everyone to continue to do what they were doing, Washinton state ignored CDC guidelines and started testing people for the novel Coronavirus and implemented drastic measures like closing down schools, SIP, social distancing. The end result is New York is the epi-center of the Coronavirus outbreak with close 30k people dead. While Washinton and California we're faring much better.

IMO just ignore these idiots. Governor Newsom isn't going to listen to these idiots whining and complaining about not being able to get a hair cut or listen to the trolls and bots.

I liken social distancing to getting a vaccine. It only works if enough people do it, for herd immunity, to protect those who are too young to get a shot.
