It’s not even the car that’s expensive, it’s the insurance. If you’re unlucky enough to not be able to go under someone else’s insurance and you’re under 25 or don’t have a clean drivers record, you’re going to be paying minimum 200 a month where I live, just for basic PL/PD. 

If you don’t know what PLPD is, it’s the bare bones insurance you’re allowed to have. It will cover your ass, in that it will pay for the other persons vehicle and/or medical costs. You’re basically fucked yourself, doesn’t cover your vehicle, and if you’re injured, well. You’re double fucked."
