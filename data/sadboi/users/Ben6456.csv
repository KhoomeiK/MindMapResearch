NoFap,fqdl1yn,t1_fqd39yn,1589291890.0,"In NoFap you‚Äôre not allowed PMO, porn masturbation or orgasm. So you have watched porn, something that counts  as a relapse. This is especially true when you consider that out of the three of them, porn is the worst. 

If you watched it for 10 seconds then that‚Äôs fine, but even you watching it when you didn‚Äôt crave for it is even worse than craving for it. Why would you watch porn then?"

NoFap,fq9yhyq,t1_fq9x8ss,1589209516.0,The job part is up to you. If you find something you really want to do then do it. If you find something shit but is doable then it‚Äôs up to you and how you‚Äôre feeling.
NoFap,fq9ufx4,t1_fq9tbuu,1589207265.0,"You don‚Äôt need to fix it all at the same time. If I were you I would first focus on sleeping. Make sure that you get to sleep at a specific time, and wake up at a specific time. Do this for a week, make it a habit to get the same amount of sleep each night. Once you‚Äôve got that down, move into another habit. With the diet, make a diet that you‚Äôre going to stick too before you actually start, so you‚Äôre ready to do it. If you have an eating habit in the evenings then I suggest that you don‚Äôt eat after the time of 6oclock. Make sure you eat enough in the day though to stay as energised as possible. This will make it easier to get up in the morning if you don‚Äôt eat nearer bedtime. 

So now you have got past them, move on to NoFap. Follow the advice I gave to you. And know that whatever you do, NEVER TOUCH YOUR PENIS! This is the last line, once you start touching your penis it‚Äôs over. You will carry on or it will make it harder to stay on NoFap. Remember that touching your penis will cause you to fail. 
Make it to 90 days and carry on. Don‚Äôt think about fapping and porn again, if you can. 

Now you have done all that, you‚Äôre a new person. You can get out into the world and pursue whatever you want. You won‚Äôt worry about your friends at this point cause you‚Äôll be happy about yourself anyways. You could also incorporate working out during this to further self progression.

I‚Äôm in a similar boat to you. And I know it may seem like I‚Äôm making this seem easy, and it‚Äôs not easy. You just have to DO it. Don‚Äôt think about it, and make it something you just DO. And however you may feel now, it will pass."
NoFap,fq9sp6c,t3_gho1cd,1589206253.0,"I know at the moment it may not be good for you and it may seem pointless to go on, but remember that this to shall pass as all the other things have in life. Always remember that. When you feel sad, remember that ‚Äúthis too shall pass‚Äù. All your negative emotions will one day be gone, and you won‚Äôt have to think about what worries you anymore. Remember that there are so many people in your shoes, me included at a smaller scale. Remember all of it will pass. Your life will get better. 

In terms of NoFap here‚Äôs some advice,

I first suggest what you do daily is educate yourself on NoFap, the benefits it gives you, and how it can help your life, and the decisions you make in life. Educate yourself on porn, and how evil it is. 

Learn what your triggers are. What triggers your urges. Once you learn that try to avoid doing what triggers you. Unfollow models/ sexually appealing celebrities off your phone. 

When you have sexual thoughts of porn, just acknowledge them, don‚Äôt try to resist, and just carry on with what you‚Äôre doing. If the urges get to strong for you to control then have a cold shower, these will rid of them straight away. 

Personally for me, music helps a lot. It always motivates me, as soon as I start listening to it, there is no way I‚Äôm relapsing. If music motivates you, try listening to it when urges come up or whenever you want.

As you get further in to NoFap. Start incorporating more habits into your life. Such as working out, reading, meditating, eating healthy. Don‚Äôt incorporate all these habits at one time. Incorporate them into your life one by one gradually."

NoFap,fps5jrk,t3_gf9ap4,1588867826.0,"Now I don‚Äôt know the right science behind it, but maybe put it into words that explain it easily.

We are sexual beings, when we don‚Äôt get enough sex our minds go through lengths to get what we want. We know that porn is easily accessible and will quench us of this sexual thirst. Eventually once we get enough of the same old sex we like to get onto more hardcore stuff to stimulate the dopamine receptors in our brain. Once we ejaculate our dopamine is then released and we feel no pleasure after because it‚Äôs a temporary form of pleasure. Once that feeling of pleasure is gone we are left with cum on our hands and no feeling of pleasure. So it is hard for us to feel happy about ejaculating. For different people the feeling of regret can come from different origins. Some people might inherently hate porn and fapping so no matter how they fap they will feel regret. Others don‚Äôt care and don‚Äôt feel regret or shame. 

When sexual urges come in to play our brain makes us forget about the regret we felt the last time we nutted. It does this to us so that we fill a sexual urge, because we are sexual beings. On NoFap what we have to learn is that our brain and it‚Äôs needs are not always the right thing to do. We need to be self aware and realise that even though are sexual urges in our brain are telling us to fap doesn‚Äôt mean we should."

The root of the problem is YOU. You need to make a change, a commitment. Just make one commitment right now that you are going to follow through on. For me that was working out six times a week.
