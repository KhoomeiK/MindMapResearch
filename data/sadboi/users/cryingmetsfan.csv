BPDlovedones,fpth1os,t1_fpte2ef,1588891104.0,"I can understand that. And I have seen that happened. Like with sticking to a diet and exercising. But with those two everyone has problem sticking to. But I get what you mean though. 

With her though she has followed through with some plans so far. Like the desire to go to therapy and try medication, which she never took before. She also already did one semester of a previous masters program, so she does try. 

That‚Äôs the hard part about all of this. I see her efforts. I know she‚Äôs a wonderful person. Also, she doesn‚Äôt yell at me or disrespect me in any way or gets violent or anything that extreme. Her problem is more of manipulation, gas lighting, severe need for reassurance, and projecting her insecurities onto our relationship, which causes us to argue. 

So with knowin that she‚Äôs trying, and that she doesn‚Äôt have anyone else, I want to at least make sure if and when it‚Äôs over, she can move on in a healthy way, not just abandon her and leave her to self-destruct. Of course if she was treating me poorly and insulting me, etc., I‚Äôd have no problem ending it as is, but for now, she‚Äôs tolerable. 

Thank you for your input and I hope your situation and family life has improved."
BPDlovedones,fptd31s,t1_fprzaxw,1588889049.0,"I agree that with therapy alone it will take a long time for her to get better. But I meant in general once she gets better then it may be easier to end it, because she is taking steps to improving. 

For example, she‚Äôs going to therapy, she just started taking medication, she‚Äôs open to discussing her issues with me for us to take a better approach at it, she just got accepted into a masters program so that makes her happy, and once the lockdown is over she‚Äôll start going to the gym. So she‚Äôs making an effort. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm hesitant to do anything drastic right now because I just want her to be Okau, cause I do care about her. 

But I did want to ask in case I will have to end it before then. And thanks to some of everyone‚Äôs comments, I have a better idea of how too."

Idk. The only way I‚Äôve told myself I can leave is if she gets better. Cause right now she‚Äôs depressed about multiple things, but thankfully in therapy. So once she can improve and have some control in her life, I will be more willing to end it.
