Vaping,fr3so7e,t1_fr3rsr9,1589865189.0,"true, but those ways take a lot longer when i need to get things done. i do more of vape + pill so the vape kicks in first and the pill kicks in later.

i use marijuana medicinally, but i'm sure i would be laughed at if i asked for a medical card because i already take vyvanse and klonopin. i don't abuse either of them; i need the vyvanse to function as i take extremely sedating psych medications, otherwise i'd sleep all day (and i still sleep a lot with the vyvanse. caffeine does nothing). as for the klonopin, i had an idiot psych nurse tell me i had to take it every day and that there was no such thing as as-needed psych meds... i'm planning on seeing a more competent practitioner to get me off of it so i can eventually use it the way it was intended.

i mention this because i'm currently disabled by my conditions... if i were approved for medicinal use i could potentially have an easier time finding a job that not only wouldn't deny me for having thc in my system but could be accommodating if i didn't vape and needed to wait for the pill to kick in, you know?"

In 2018 I had planned to kill myself on a Friday or Saturday, I forget which. And I was so relieved. I lived life normally with the comfort that all the bad would be over soon.

On Friday, a lovely lady I'd been chatting with on OKCupid asked if we could meet on Saturday for the first time.

I told myself, whatever. One more day then.

It was one of the best days I had in a very long time. I decided not to go through with it, at least for then.

That doesn't mean I hate all medical professionals, I'm just always guarded and skeptical and nervous when meeting new ones. Anyway, I've had two psych nurses. One is awful and should probably lose his license. The other is wonderful. She really knows her stuff and always surprises me in her knowledge where other medical professionals have let me down. I've noticed she has multiple degrees in nursing, at least one of them from my school which is in the top 100 in the world. She's good enough that now she is teaching nursing students; I know they are in great hands. She's so kind and gentle and open-minded and has almost always gone above and beyond. I need to find someone else soon as she isn't licensed to prescribe in my state, but I hope I get to be her patient again in the future. I'm not looking forward to anyone else."
