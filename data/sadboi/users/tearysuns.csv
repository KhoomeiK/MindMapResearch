BPD,f7ejsc7,t3_dtbq56,1573659240.0,"took the words right out of my fucking mouth. everything is a contradiction in life at this point. barely functioning, but still playing along with the whole ""road to recovery"" bullshit. not everyone gets better, let's face it. good moments last only for the split second they do and even then it's not enough. i've been getting help since i was 11 (am 18M now). how many more years will it take?? im not willing to wait and if i do, by then ill probably have fucked over most of my chances of a stable future because of my self sabotaging nature. the worst part yet is being self aware, much like u seem to be. u know the rules, how to handle the crisis moments but they mean fuck ass when this giant empty blackness is sucking u right in. fuck this, seriously.

thanks for sharing ur thoughts and i wish u the best."

SuicideWatch,f376108,t1_f369ssm,1570721857.0,"Their caring can only mean something if we allow it to. As with anything in life. A great deal depends on us, our perspective and how we choose to tackle situations. Your question of ""why"" can be answered in a million of different ways, to each their own. No one has to stay, it's just something we do before we go. I feel your frustration and pain, my man."
SuicideWatch,f35xtss,t3_dfu223,1570696722.0,"More than enough people DO actually care. It's just not going to solve something that is internal and deeply personal. Everyone is selfish. We want to go, leave the eternal pain and torture behind, they'd rather have us stay so they can keep themselves comforted by our presence. Some of us never heal, you know. And that's okay. There's no moral high ground you belong to depending on whether you decide to end it or hang on a little more. I hope the best for all of us, yet I know better, even for myself. Good luck."

And that's exactly right, family isn't supposed to be hostile and unkind. Especially when it comes to something that is out of your hands. You did not choose to have this disconnect between brain and body and I personally can't understand why anyone that isn't yourself would come between that. I hope you can find a safe place to freely be, perhaps a middle ground at some point. For you as well as for your daughter. I know I'm sick of being treated as only family if x or when x. You either are or aren't. I'd say go for it, choose your path, never look back and take along with you those who are willing to stand beside you. Much love, my man."
FTMMen,f04le8v,t3_d3koul,1568390076.0,"If you ever wanna talk in depth, pm me. I understand and live your situation. I have a Muslim family. 

You're incredibly strong for living through this and you definitely don't owe them shit. Religion is never an excuse to dehumanize someone. Please realize that they're wrong for this and you're completely innocent. All that bullshit regarding ""God"" are manmade concepts. A true God wouldn't have put you in this situation in the first place.

I'll have to be honest and say that they most likely won't change their ways. Religious people don't see things for what they are, they go by belief. You're a human being, a father and a guy that is deserving of respect. Don't forget that. The community is here for you. Good luck, friend."
