sex,fqx8ye8,t3_glfdjj,1589728260.0,"For my part (as a straight male whose opinion TOTALLY wasn't asked for), I just don't feel comfortable being sexual with other guys... even locker room joking... whereas I am completely okay with that sort of banter with my women friends and as a sort of bonding with my bi and gay women friends. I'm also okay with sexual intimacy with multiple women and between women that I am not comfortable with when it comes to other guys.

When it comes to my partners, I do admit that I am and have been more comfortable with them expressing interest in other women than other men. I'm more jealous of other men catching their interest than women. Perhaps that's half fantasy of being together in the mff, but I also think it's stems from my past.

I don't know for sure, but I think it comes from a lot of bullying during my school days from other guys (I was/am the weird kid). Anything and anyone important to me was taken (from my naive, jealous kid perspective) by my bullies. 

I didn't understand that at that point that girls had their own agency and, when they didn't like me back and preferred someone who (totally independent to them) was super mean to me, it felt more like I was being beaten at the biggest, most important competition of all. So I never really bonded with other guys for a long time... and certainly not with any locker room brotimacy. 

I dunno, I think I'm rambling. Does any of this make sense?"
