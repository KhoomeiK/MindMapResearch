BPD,ffxuwub,t3_evo9y4,1580332904.0,"It's incredible how this disorder pushes us to make things we understand, even in hindsight that are horrible. I have been like that with people, people who didn't deserve it and I don't know if we have this in common or not, but one thing I have noticed as a pattern is that when I was doing it, there were two voices in my head; one that was telling me that the person in front of me is hurting me and she deserves to be hurt by me and the other voice was appalled and disgusted and most of all ashamed for what I'm doing. When anger starts, you go blind and the only thing you can think of is how to stop her from hurting you. At that moment, and I say this fully aware of how hard it is, the right move is what you're doing right now, taking responsibility, facing the truth, facing the fact that you are crossing the line. One thing that encouraged my behavior when I was behaving like that is that I had Noone tell me I'm making a mistake, so I deliberately convinced myself not to hear that voice, convince myself that I'm not making a mistake and I am right to hit her. Take a step back, breathe, stop yourself from doing things you'll regret, let your mind be clear from the anger before you answer. It takes a lot of practice but I really hope you get there. Therapy will help btw"

This year, after I've gotten a little used to the fact I'm in charge of them, I started taking more and more control (I have another co-trainee that teaches with me and she usually got all the credit), I speak more and I try to build a relationship with the kids because I know that this is what kids need as it was what I needed when I was their age, someone they trust to help them grow as humans. It's a role you have to play, and even though it's extremely difficult and you should never be judged over it, you have to leave your personal issues in your mind and play that role. I know it's harsh to ask someone to do that from a person but I think you will see that this will actually give you the confidence you need, because it's something you know, something you can do.

Both equally important, people really don't realize the power of forgiving other people, but mostly forgiving yourself and stop blaming yourself for everything, some things are really not your fault, not your responsibility and you shouldn't punish yourself for them, you don't deserve it. After so many years I finally forgave myself and stopped blaming myself and feeling guilty for the abuse I got from my parents, I forgave them too and I know what they did was because of their own complicated reasons, sometimes people hurt you without realizing it.

Honestly everyone shut up with your ideas about how bpd people ""can't love"" and how we just ""feel our voids"", well f*cking newsflash, that's how every relationship works, you search for the things you miss, and if love is what you need then love is what you will look for. I'm tired of apologizing because I feel what I feel and I am who I am, yes I am bpd, yes I split and I have unreasonable feelings sometimes and I do my f*cking best to deal with it without killing everyone that gets on my nerves everyday, being bpd doesn't mean we are bad people, we deserve to love and be loved.

I wish I could stop and I wish things that led me to having these disorders hadn't happened but they have and it really is who I am, so when I'm getting better I feel like I'm gonna lose my identity because I have learnt to define myself that way. However, I think one thing that helps me is that I don't focus on ""fixing"" myself, I'm never gonna stop being ocd or bpd, I'm just gonna make myself better, evolve into something better. It's kind of like losing weight, you shouldn't be thinking about making yourself a ""thin"" person, a person you're envious of, but focus on making a better version of yourself, it's not just accepting yourself, it's more about accepting the fact that you don't need fixing cause you're not broken. <3"
