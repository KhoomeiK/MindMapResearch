However, when it is abused, turned into a habitual routine (i.e. all day every day) for a prolonged period of time like 10 years or over, the physiological and psychological dependence on it can be a big deal. Speaking from personal experience, i was extremely dependent on it, and i had a medical mmj doctors reccomendation for 10+ years. I was used to getting the highest and most potent grade cannabis all the time in cali, so when i quit it was a pretty intense and an extremely uncomfortable experience. The potency is on another level nowadays, especially the product going around in california."

There are so many positives... i am in the best shape of my life because i go to the gym consistently 6 times a week every morning at 4 AM (including sauna and steam room), my focus is back, memory is so much improved, not paranoid or scared of going out and socializing, insane level of improved breathing, not have munchies (lost 15 lbs), more ambition in life, picking up new hobbies like solo travelling to different cities and states when i am not working, a significant amount of extra money now (used to spend $200USD on ganja weekly), found a new job thats pays a lot better than what im used to, successfully established a savings account (did not have one before), not thinking about getting faded every 2 minutes and worrying about re-upping when my stash is running low, and most of all just learning to be happy and content with a healthy mind/body and peaceful spirit. Hit me up if you ever feel you need a life line, will be more than glad to throw down some sincere words of encouragement. Cheers to a new chapter in your life ~!"
