I dunno what to say but I get this, I had miserable 2019, I was doing a job which I did not like at all but got no choice cuz I live my own. 2020 isn‚Äôt a good year under the COVID-19. Yeah, I tried to give up but I also don‚Äôt think I deserve all the shit...I did tons of interviews and applied so many jobs and also I got so many rejections. Later last week, I got an amazing job offer from a company, and I finally can changed my work. All I want to say is never give up yourself and your life even you are in your darkest moment. You have to believe in yourself and try your best to get yourself back on track."
