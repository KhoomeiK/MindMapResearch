CODWarzone,fm4fa84,t3_fhse9f,1585752992.0,"My issue with this, is games simply don't last long enough. The limit to trigger the bonus round should be much larger/loots/contracts less valuable."

footballmanagergames,fkdysax,t3_fhod7i,1584100252.0,"I‚Äôll never forget my Columbian Regen - Fernando Montoya - signed him as a promising young forward, sent him on loan to Spain in order to achieve a work permit, and BOOM second season in PL he develops into the worlds best striker, signed a new contract with a 140m release clause, and despite Barcelona triggering said clause, he pledged his future to Sunderland, and helped me finish third in the premier league in my 3rd season, along with Sandro Tonali. I sometimes wonder what he‚Äôs doing now. My greatest FM achievement to date."
