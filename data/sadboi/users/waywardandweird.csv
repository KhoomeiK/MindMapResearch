They have special pillows depending on the site of surgery or radiation because sleeping can become uncomfortable (I got one of these from a friend and it was great)  and  cold caps if hair loss is a risk.

Most od what you're looking for is changes in the breast.  On the whole,  cancerous lumps tend to be harder,  immobile, and they're more likely to be irregular in size.  Sometimes there will be nipple changes (inversion),  nipple leakage, ""orange peel rash"" on top of the skin, or dents that form in the breast. The lymph nodes can sometimes be felt.

From what you say it could be anything from needing an iron pill, having diabetes, undiagnosed lung or heart issues, celiac disease, thyroid issues, parasites, or one of a zillion cancers. 

I'd say go in to your primary and gyn and have them do full workups. While you're at it,  look into a way to manage your stress (I like my plants,  cats,  and exercise if my body lets me) even I'd it means a couple sessions worth a professional just to get some tips. Stress can also be a mind- fuck too. I thought I was going into menopause, no period,  losing my hair,  then my heart rate and bp went nuts,  then I shit the bed.

They said I didn't have a year and I'm 38 now, survived a second diagnosis in 2012. Watched a lot of my friends die. Don't know why I'm the one who survived.  It sucks. 

I had been complaining to my primary that I didn't feel well for a year before diagnosis.  I put on 30 lbs, which had never happened,  I felt sickly and low-energy, recurring respiratory stuff.  I did poop tests,  24 hr urine collections,  scans,  tested for everything... except breast cancer.  I was lucky that she took me seriously because a lot of docs will blow young women off as  lumpy or dense breasts, and at the time,  I was the youngest bc patient they'd ever had at the large metropolitan institution I went to.

2. Don't take anything personally. With PTSD we can have a lot of trouble with this one because so many things may have been done to harm us on purpose,  but for the general population,  day to day things,  it's likely stupidity instead of malice. Abusers like to throw this one in your face too to gaslight you, so there's a line.  Work on your radar and trust it.  
3. Don't make assumptions. Kinda goes with number 2.
4. Always do your best. Your best will change from day to day based on circumstances. 

I put the printout she gave me on my mirror and I keep a copy in my phone too, so [here you go](https://imgur.com/a/UGiJdjE). This one has all there little explanations for each rule.

Sometimes dehydration feels like hunger and water will help fill you up anyways. Then distract yourself. Play all the games, read all the fluff (nothing triggering), look at pictures of baby animals, whatever. Once in a while I say eat candy sandwiches at 2 am.

*I'd also usually say go outside and walk,  run, look at a tree, but with the shelter in place almost everywhere, stay safe."

*And honestly,  I can't handle the humidity and heat anymore either. Like,  why do people run marathons at Disney?  Last time I was there it was 114°!"

AmItheAsshole,fm0vfh4,t3_fs7jhf,1585666944.0,"NTA. You helped enough times. Before I found seamless titanium hoops I just bought basically a gross of nose screws because, 20 years in, I was losing them all the time.  I pull them out in my sleep.  Washing them down the sink and repeatedly taking apart the plumbing constantly is ridiculous. It will close fast though, so if you don't want to blow your money,  maybe do it one last time so you can keep it open long enough to replace it with something with a back?  A very short flat backed stud maybe? You can order one of those  more cheaply than repiercing. *It's probably rather her responsibility to order it,  not yours."

*I feel like I should add that I don't blame her because I'm not a fan myself.  It's fun to play in when you're a kid,  but adulting in a midwestern blizzard sucks."

succulents,flvhmjn,t1_flvghyh,1585523999.0,"I mix my own. My lithops arrived 10 in a teeny plastic 1oz condiment cup! I replanted and now they are 5 to a pot. Just a bunch of little cheap plastic 3 in pots for now. I'l invest in better if I can keep them alive. I grouped them by which are closest in growing stages as best I could.  Some of mine need more or less soil, but plain cactus soil should never be used on its own of course. For these I mix probably 10٪ cactus soil, 20% hermit crab sand (had cocoa fibers and junk in it?)  and 70% rock mix. The ratio of rock to soil in these things blew me away when I started. I've gone through 3.5 bags of rock,  2 bags of sand,  and essentially no actual cactus potting soil.

*They arrived i individually wrapped in tissue and survived shipping just fine.

*Edit 10-20 sand."

succulents,flve08p,t1_flvd3hu,1585521834.0,"Honestly,  it's so new that I just potted it on Thursday,  so I haven't had to water yet.  I usually water on Sundays in the winter for most, less for lithops maybe. I'm going to keep an extra close eye on it while blooming and get to know what it wants. With all of mine so far though you can feel the difference in weight in a dry pot. It is so humid in the summer I'm thinking I won't have to water as much.

*I feel like eventually you can tell by touch or sight if they are thirsty.  They might visibly shrink or wrinkle,  or just lose weight. The leaves might not feel a firm as usual."

This is one of my newest ones actually. I ordered a bunch from a new place and I was really happy with what I got. I honestly was going to stay in bed today because life isn't going great right now,  but I wanted to hang out near it.  It's literally exactly what I needed.  It at least got me to limp to the couch."

What he said is very wrong and that isn't how healthy people with healthy relationships  talk to each other.

*Also, my father talked to my mother like that, then he tried to shoot her in the face. I was 5 when they divorced and I was thrilled to be rid of at least one asshole in my life, despite other unending problems. A ""broken home"" is better than a broken mother."
