nintendo,fnty0qi,t3_g3ptch,1587250768.0,I finished my coding homework without crying this week! Thanks for the giveaway.
UCSD,flmriob,t1_flmm76h,1585293648.0,"Thank you, and do you know how long this whole process typically takes?"
UCSD,fll13dv,t1_fll0u6j,1585251643.0,No I’m not. I’m just restating the rules and test taking condition.
UCSD,fljexy7,t1_fljcnz4,1585209637.0,"Thanks, I appreciate it. I’m going through a hard time and this situation isn’t making it better. I’m worried I’m not articulate and mentality stable enough to present my case clearly and w/o crying lol."
UCSD,fljek6l,t1_fljd5rm,1585209172.0,"It happened this final. So during the corona virus thing. Someone posted exam questions on chegg. The professor claimed I posted and/or copied from it. I’m guessing my solutions looked similar. It was open note, book, and internet. We just posted our solutions on gradescope. It was not recorded."
UCSD,fljedcf,t1_fljczvn,1585208946.0,Can I asked what they accused you of the first time? And how you convince them to drop it?
UCSD,fljdv0q,t3_fp3we7,1585208349.0,"Omg what is going on. I was accused of cheating on my exam too and I’m not the only one in my class. I’ve been stressed out too so you’re not alone! I would set up a meeting with a student advocate ASAP since slots run out fast 

I would say wait for AI to contact you then worry about it. Tell your parents. Tell them the best and worst case scenarios. Mine helped me calm down a lot since they told me they will stay by my side and this would be a learning experience. 

Once you get the evidence you’ll have a better idea of what you’re working with. I heard that the AIO is actually pretty nice and they are there to help you learn. Be honest, tell them you did not cheat and tell them how you’re worried this case is going on for too long.

You also get an appeal so you have two chances to be heard. 

I’m telling you this to also lift myself up bc I am also going through the same thing. It sucks. If you have no one to talk to, you can reach out to me. We can get through this together."
UCSD,fli5opm,t3_fonxcf,1585175815.0,I was told to reach out to chegg and tell them I was wrongly accused and somehow ask them to tell the school who posted and viewed the solutions so that I can get off the hook. But idk if that’s doable. Is anyone familiar with cheggs policies? I also feel like the school will still say I cheated off someone else then who used chegg. How often do cases like this get dismissed? I feel like once you’re speaking with the AIO they basically think you’re guilty.
depression,fdmi0qh,t3_eb0ggo,1578550612.0,I get it. Life feels to fucking long.
depression,fdmhyg3,t1_fdmh6wf,1578550545.0,I’m sorry to hear that. At least you’re not alone! I’m super sad too haha
depression,fdmhvvd,t1_fdmgh8g,1578550472.0,Thank you:) I just feel like no one will take my depression seriously until it’s too late... I just feel alone. Sometimes I go on reddit and most call to helps like this and then delete them later. Which sounds ridiculous. Thank you for your comment. It makes me feel heard even when it’s through the internet.
depression,fdjff65,t1_fdjf8bc,1578468502.0,Tiredness in a relationship? I do feel like we are getting use to each other and I feel taken for granted a lot. Maybe that has to do with some of it.
oddlysatisfying,fbd4lse,t1_fbcfeit,1576746453.0,I subconsciously read your comment with an Irish accent
knitting,fbcd9be,t3_ecju2y,1576721247.0,Wow! Cutest sweater ever! Good job!
AskReddit,f85p8hi,t1_f85oytj,1574280070.0,It’s strange but I totally get it.
AskReddit,f7nhkuy,t3_dx0fox,1573904002.0,"Write letters. Thank you letters, random letters, appreciation letters...To yourself, your mom, your dad, you sister...just so you can get a few thoughts out. It helps to show some gratitude, and you get to work on grammar while practicing penmanship. It’s up to you if you want to actually want to give them or not. You can just do it to get things off your chest."
depression,f7j5hdk,t3_dwdgmb,1573771049.0,Yay! Good for you! I still need to do mine. Seeing your post makes me want to go home a do them. Just so I can feel how proud you are of yourself too. Thanks for showing me the happiness I’m missing out on by delaying it.
depression,f7j4nrf,t1_f7i4fyz,1573770611.0,I have a similar approach. I sit in my car when I’m sad a lot. Whether at home or at school. I just sit in my car and cry a little and then get out like nothing happened. It’s weird how a car can feel like a safety box.
apolloapp,f10pzjr,t3_d7iop7,1569115861.0,Thanks for the giveaway!

AskReddit,etkk30q,t3_cbwrxv,1562900095.0,The white plastic thing on top of the bottle cap of a Martinelli sparkling cider is actually cap for when you don’t finish the bottle. Just peel the perforated bottom half of it off and push it on top of the bottle. This helps stores left overs since once the metal one is taken off it no longer works as a cap.
