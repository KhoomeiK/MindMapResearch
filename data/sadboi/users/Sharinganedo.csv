Anxiety,fk844rf,t3_fgxa3x,1583949004.0,"Everyone is panicking because the media is telling them they should.

The flu is really what we should be worried about, but as stated already, practicing basic hygiene techniques like handwashing and being careful with coughing is the best measures we can take without all this other stuff. Covid-19 has a lower rate of fatality than the flu. The elderly is where the issue is, and people with underlying health problems. If you're relatively healthy and younger, you likely will be okay. The biggest problem I've heard is that Covid 19 goes deep into the lungs which is why it's a problem."
