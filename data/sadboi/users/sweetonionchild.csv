It's her thing and it feels like you've taken it from her - it really sucks when you're into something that feels unique to you, and you get by. But then someone else does it because of you and they get more attention and love, etc. But gatekeeping is shitty too, and that makes you feel bad because you can't pursue something you like. 

I've been in both situations and they both suck. Maybe, if you're planning to sell stuff, include your sister in it. Make it known that she is the one that got you into the hobby, it might help. But there's certainly no asshole to be found if you have a little empathy and figure out the logic behind each person."

I'm the same age as you (14f), and I spoke to my parents recently about my stress. It's helped a lot and I'm feeling a bit better, because someone knows what's going on and I've support now. It was scary to explain myself to them, and incredibly awkward, but worth it. 

I really don't know where I'm going with this, but just know that sitting down and having the balls to talk to someone is worth it if they might be able to help.

But you know what I didn't do? Complain, whine and throw a tantrum at the people doing their best to make the day better, and trying to cheer me up. I had something called a conversation with my mum, my dad looked after my brother so my mum and I could have a few hours of peace after my brother's mayhem, and we played with my pet rats. I accepted the situation, adapted to it, didn't act like an AH to those trying to help, spoke about my feelings as one should, and I've been promised a day to myself once lockdown is over where we'll go to the place we missed again this year.

Another point - they're sexualising themselves. They are making the active choice to do that, and feel comfortable with it. When someone else does it, however, to someone not already sexualising themselves - yikes. That's not their choice. It feels uncomfortable.
