Codependency,fqz9fw7,t1_fqxwppv,1589762667.0,"That’s a great point! It’s all about not going so far that you hurt yourself and finding the balance between being caring and trying to live someone else’s life. 

I feel like we all have a duty to care about one another and check in with people emotionally, but at a certain point, it’s up to the other person and not you, and sometimes it’s hard to tell when that is. 

Thank you. This was very comforting even just to hear that others struggle to know when giving is too much too. I feel like most people are kind of the opposite where they give too little and it’s nice to know that there are others out there with my same struggles. 

I’ve been burned very badly by people who would take from me endlessly but I also have to own when I went way too far as well when no one even asked me to. But I still want to be a caring and nurturing person. I want healthy relationships with others. I don’t want to be a warm doormat, but I also don’t want to be a cold Scrooge...it’s all a balance like you said!"

He feels entitled to borrow money from you and has been budgeting his spending with your money in mind....you are able to save from your lower income PLUS some to lend out while he’s spending thinking that as long as he can get you the money back, it’s fine to stress out your finances and to have a transactional relationship with you...any time he asks...you say yes. He’s come to rely on depend on you but not in a healthy way.

Look into codependency...I don’t mean to offend but this is a very common issue (I have this same problem). It’s a self esteem issue (people pleasing). You are displaying a lack of boundaries which is the number one symptom. It’s okay and necessary to have boundaries. And there’s a lot of articles and YouTube videos out there that can teach you how to say “no.”

I do like what the others are suggesting though to set the boundary without putting blame on him. I know you didn’t blame him though but I’m just saying I don’t disagree with the other suggestions"

I listened to a podcast awhile ago where the host was interviewing someone that was an expert on lying (I think they worked for the FBI maybe?) and even they said that a lot of times it’s impossible to tell. And that is an expert’s opinion in the science of lying who could not always give a definitive assessment...

Not everyone is a scumbag, but these things do happen. That is traumatizing though what happened to you and it might be scary to trust again but I think what happend to you (as in, a long term relationship with a married man) is not likely to happen again. The vast majority of men do not have the stamina to juggle a lie like that for that long. 

Sure, you need to be careful about one night stands or short flings, but for something that goes on for that long and would be that traumatizing....I don’t think so."

It sounds like you might be making a really dark goal and that you might be working toward it maybe...I’d highly recommend you call one of those emergency hotlines to talk about these feelings and to see what they suggest

I think therapy is awesome but I really am not qualified to give you advice about this. 

I would make a suggestion though to watch one of those weight loss shows while you wait to be able to go(like Khloe Kardashians Revenge Body is excellent for what I’m about to explain)....I want you to watch a few episodes (maybe even just one would be enough) and I want you to pay attention to how each person that really tries changes EMOTIONALLY by the end. Some people start off and you know, they seem like they’re a thousand miles away and in excruciating emotional pain but....by the end of the show they’re smiling HUGE smiles  and their enthusiasm comes back, and....that happens without even trying to make that happen. We can’t always trust our thoughts...you might be thinking that nothing really feels good and that things can’t get better but they 100% can and will if you start working toward it. 

I was sort of the opposite. I was very underweight and I spent a decade struggling to want to eat more and my world was extremely dark. It wasn’t until I listened to one girls story who had the same issues where she explained how paranoid and disinterested she had become that it really clicked for me...I spent the next three days eating nonstop. My stomach hurt because it had shrunk so much and wasn’t able to hold enough until that third day. For some reason I had to sleep a lot too. Either way though, to my surprise, my thoughts had completely changed. I had intellectualized nutrition to death and realized that I had over complicated everything, but was finally able to just sit down and do it once everything clicked....I was calmer and more positive. I wasn’t frantic like before....our thoughts can be huge liars....you have a bunch of people who love the hell out of you and things can 1000% get better if you work toward it. 

I’d recommend you start walking every day and check in and pay attention to how your mood changes (it might get worse before it starts getting better) and is also recommend getting rid of all the junk food in your house if you have any (the ingredients have been scientifically proven to make people depressed). Those are a couple smaller things you can start doing baby steps with that are going to have a huge impact. I wish you all the best of luck and I hope you take my advice!"
socialanxiety,fpqv760,t3_gf0z3r,1588833208.0,"Girl....You definitely have depression (and that is definitely making your anxieties worse). 

It sounds like you’re in the indulging/avoiding/self sabotage state right now. 

You might not have been “lazy” about finishing high school..,it sounds more like you’re indulging a fear of your potential (and therefore, also possible rejection)....and of course, depression too. I kind of have a firm belief there is no such thing as laziness (just symptoms of depression/anxiety whether that’s small scale or highly depressed)

Being in the “I don’t care” stage can get really out of control. You’re really young right now and you still have the drive to get up and go to work so you might feel like this doesn’t really matter right now and that you’re almost getting away with something but....let me tell you that youthful energy goes away. I used to eat terrible foods, starve myself most days, watch too much tv, not exercise, leave all my responsibilities off to the last minute, but....I could still get up, take a shower and show up at places that I was supposed to be, but.....that energy ran out. I ended up in a lot of trouble (financial and serious health problem and eventually a prescription pill addiction). And you know what else? ...Everyone’s patience wore out too. People are extremely forgiving of young people (and they even want to help them a lot) but one day they start turning on you and very few people want to help unless you are displaying a huge independent effort (and maybe even not then...as you age, you’re kind of thrown to the wolves). 

I’m not saying that you are to blame or that your feeling are invalid. And I’m not suggesting AT ALL just to snap out of it (that is a RIDICULOUS expectation) but....yeah, definitely start researching how to become undepressed (it’s only going to get worse and there’s a ton of small things you can do to start feeling better even in quarantine like eating healthy, staying in a regular schedule, exercise, etc..). All of that stuff wonderfully will give you  more confidence and then everything will become easier (but this won’t happen overnight and no one expects that’s out of you). 

I am in....DEEP shit. I took way too long to care...I missed out on a lot and I sabotaged so bad and spiraled out so much that I’ve had an insane amount of work to do (it just seems to pile up more and more the longer you wait to get serious about your recovery). I’ve made crazy improvement the last three years though! 🙂💖

I also realize that everyone heals at their own pace and is on their own journey and you might not be ready to face all these demons, but...just think of this as a cautionary warning from the ghost of Christmas future if there are instances where you know you are indulging and giving your depression full permission to rule over your life rather than just struggling against the current (I don’t even want to think about the things I did at your age treating my body like garbage and even thinking it was funny at times because I thought I had so much time and like I said, no matter what I’d always be able to roll out of bed and show up to whatever I needed to do).

I had a TON of early trauma and that definitely effected the slowness of my willingness to give my recovery my all (so I get you and feel for you) but....thinking I had time was a very real thing that a lot of people don’t talk about that definitely made me feel like I was almost allowed to skip using my time to recover) 

It’s very hard though. I understand. I’m not over my social anxiety at all just yet but my self care game is on point and I’ve progressed and evolved so much since I seriously hunkered down and decided I was going to really give it my all"

If I’m going on a walk or even the grocery store I’d wear them and then it would calm me and distract me away from all my thoughts (I would t do that in the grocery store I go to now though because that’s considered way too rude in the suburbs). 

Make sure you listen to incredibly happy music/audiobooks/podcasts though.....I mean like, ecstatic....I used to listen to disco, pop and Michael Jackson A LOT when I thought I was going to lose it. and I started to really key in and pay attention to how things effect me....there were a lot of entertainment that I’d consume without thinking about it, but now I really pay attention to my feelings and I sort out if something is bringing me down or making me feel better"
Agoraphobia,fpc6l3n,t3_gcl785,1588489316.0,"What part of nyc do u live in (I’m asking because some of your anxiety might actually be justified)? 

I actually had my first panic attack and became agoraphobic while I was living there. 

The people....don’t make you feel safe there....there’s a distinct apathy there that always made me feel a bit uncomfortable like I could pass out and fall to the ground, but then have no one help me...

I don’t want to add to your anxiety, but I’ve had a lot of experiences there where I didn’t feel safe, so....just saying you might be reacting to your environment too?

How did I beat my agoraphobia?.....well.....it took time but I just kept forcing myself to leave my home. I’d spend extra long at the grocery store instead of rushing around like everyone else (which is another way nyc raised my anxiety). I decided to get jobs at places that made me really afraid...I became a waitress....and a store clerk....I was put on medication but I think that actually made things worse. I started smoking weed and that helped me work through a lot. 

Those jobs were very hard for me to get by the way because I was so incredibly anxious. Understanding everything going on in those environments though Gave me more confidence and I felt more in control.....I had the luxury of time though because I had just graduated college...

I didn’t completely beat it though. Like...whenever my depression gets bad...so does my “need” to avoid the world. 

So self care is huge. Exercise. Anything to keep the blues away. Yoga (do it every day if you’re able...that shit is crazy....like, if you do it a couple times a week you’ll definitely experience some benefits, but....do it every day and I think it might blow your mind). A lot of anxiety is tied to our body’s being physically weak which makes so much sense and explains why the elderly are startled so easily....

During that time in nyc....I was also in denial about my eating disorder. I wasn’t eating enough or treating myself right which made everything all the more scary."

askwomenadvice,fovr54j,t3_g9rar2,1588106090.0,"This is way easier said than done, but...you have to love yourself first. 

Everyone has heard that you need to love yourself in order for someone to love you but....they don’t tell you that it works the other way around too. I’ve had a similar thing but oddly with friendships too...if someone liked me, I’d assume automatically that their worth was lower than I thought (because I didn’t value myself). 

You might also have emotional intimacy issues like me too (the symptoms of this i recently learned are things that you wouldn’t suspect...like chasing after people that are emotionally unavailable or people you feel like you need to help/change is a huge red flag symptom of that...its like you’re setting yourself up to make obtaining love so difficult that you get to sort of avoid it because you’ve made it impossible for yourself...and you trick yourself with the distraction of all sorts of fights or negative worries about the other person. Distraction. Avoidance). You might actually be afraid of that sort of commitment because you’re afraid of real, raw vulnerability and maybe have tons of negative associations with relationships because of your dad. 

And if You’re anything like me, all of these things are in the mix and they all play off of each other. 

Learning to love yourself will fix all of that (self care, living authentically, doing as many things that bring you real joy as possible, getting all the skeletons out of your closet)."
BPD,fov7khj,t1_fouc3gk,1588096669.0,"Absolutely! I get you. It’s like, you want to believe in the perfect person and, for me anyway, it was like my reason to socialize.

I felt more sure of myself even though I have the worst self esteem ever). 

In this “new world” I’m letting in a much bigger variety and most of those people seem to need more from me than my FP’s ever did too, and it’s so confusing because now that I understand how bad people can be too it feels like a much bigger gamble with my very sensitive feelings at stake...like, im realizing that I used to gravitate toward these highly positive, high energy and VERY nurturing types. They would constantly be nurturing me socially and had tons of energy to do that and to do it all with a very positive and contagious outlook, but.....regular people?.....they don’t have tons of energy. They don’t necessarily read my mind and accommodate all my emotions and social hangups. And they might even need help thinking more positive about things. I’m realizing now exactly what I was doing before....I was looking for a parent that was very low work and would put SO MUCH effort into me (compared to what most people do anyway). I’m not sure if you are the same but I’ve felt like my BPD strongly correlates to my maturity as well. And maybe I’ve been too overwhelmed this whole time to grow up."
FriendshipProblems,fo7bvkw,t3_g5k8ni,1587575694.0,"Ooooh, try not to take that personally. If they truly are mentally struggling, that might have more to do with them really wanting to withdrawal from other people rather than withdrawing from you specifically. 

I’m not sure what your friend has but most mental issues exaggerate a sense of overwhelm but they also can make you extremely paranoid, and that has nothing to do with you. They might be feeling overwhelmed even by the smallest and most positive of interactions (they might feel extreme guilt also not being able to  be a good friend back right now or might even be extremely embarrassed or down on themselves about). And yeah, they might also be paranoid that you don’t actually like them or that something random you said might have been loaded with double meaning that was twisted into something that was hurtful toward them....

Depending on how severe their situation is, you might want to consider checking up on them if you have another way to do that. 

If they aren’t bad enough to be worried...then just give them some time and try to be really patient and supportive when they are feeling up to talk to you."
relationship_advice,fnhzlzk,t1_fnhqcr1,1586971488.0,"Right? I felt like it was a huge boundary violation but my boyfriend’s basically been telling me that people share all sorts of stuff with him and that his extroverted friends do talk like this (I’ve sat with them and they do sort of frankly put everything out there which I guess is a healthy thing to do). I’ve had them say things along the same lines to me that didn’t feel like they were hitting on me but it’s definitely not what I’m used to and I didn’t think those conversations were very appropriate (though it seemed normal to them). I live in an extremely liberal place that’s pretty sexually obsessed but I come from more of a conservative place where no one would do that so this is extra confusing for me. 

I don’t think she has a huge crush on my boyfriend. I mean, I’m only guessing though (just because I’ve seen what she’s like with one that she really is truly obsessed with which is...sad). But her behavior with other guys has really concerned me (and also stressed out my boyfriend and I at times). I guess I could see her maybe throwing herself at him if he was the random guy that was around for when she maybe finally does crack.... Wrong place and time maybe. But that freelance project has been over for months now and they only ever hang out when I’m there also besides maybe once a year when her boyfriend wants to play music with him  (her and her husband are more my friends than my boyfriend’s). 

My boyfriend is also now super sensitive to me sort of cutting off friends because I was so socially behind for awhile too unfortunately though so it’s been really difficult to talk to him about this (I’ve had a lot of trauma that I’ve been working through but that’s another story) and I’ve cut out friends before over simple communication problems but also my paranoias that I would get from my anxiety. I’ve tended to take things way too seriously many times in the past because of my social anxiety unfortunately. He’s worried that I’m being too hard on her and that I should sympathize more but...I guess I don’t really want to put myself in this situation also. I’ve sort of lost my boyfriend’s trust in this particular case which sucks (he’s always going to think I’m just over reacting until I maintain a healthy group of friends for awhile probably). 

Her and her husband seem to finally be talking about things which is good, and I’m wondering if I should just talk to her about it. Say I felt really hurt and felt like she violated a boundary? 

I do see what you’re saying and I fear that she’s sort of a ticking time bomb but...I feel so conflicted because she’s been such a great friend to me otherwise. She’s really seen me through and helped me through some tough times"

socialanxiety,fncozjw,t3_g0xcop,1586842656.0,"Start lifting weights. All of those thoughts will disappear and you’ll naturally be magnetic. Maybe not all of your OCD will be gone but a substantial amount will and your social anxiety will likely be fine too (you might be introverted still but you won’t care like you do now). 

And I really do mean weight lifting and not running or yoga or soccer. All of that is okay but weight lifting changes your personality drastically (for the better). And you also generally start to feel better overall almost immediately. I’m a girl that has suggested this to so many guys and every single one of them that has listened and really given it a good effort have gone from low self esteem and anxious dudes to studs within a matter of months. 

I know your head is bombarded by like, 10,000 thoughts every second of the day and you feel like you need to peel every single one of them away but.....just trust me that 99% of all that disappears once you’re fit (make sure you’re eating enough too...if you’re to skinny it’ll just make your anxiety worse).

It’s hard, but....I think it’s just life. There are SO MANY things you can do to become more magnetic (even as an introvert), friendly and entertaining. But yeah, confidence and enthusiasm are attractive and they command attention. That’s something that isn’t out of your reach that you can work toward. You’re not inherently “this way” and you can make changes wherever you want so that you can get the life and relationships you want (I had trouble with this too when I was younger)

You shouldn’t make him feel bad or find ways to lower down his sister either though. That’s who they are and they seem happy and healthy that way. That’s not fair or healthy to them. The only person you can change is yourself. Turn yourself into someone that lights up the room and grabs the attention if that’s what you want (which it sounds like you do). I know that’s much easier said than done but like....life is all about learning and evolving.....and it’s also just how it is. If you want something...you need to work toward it...not force other people to give to you, you know? 

Like, entertaining people is a real skill (that’s why actors are paid an absurd amount of money to do movies). And even highly trained actors and writers sometimes create a movie that no one wants to see, but....what if the actor got on Instagram and started complaining that no one wanted to watch their movie and instead everyone was going to see the 800th super hero movie that came out instead that was really well done and super fun? Would you let that actor guilt you into going to see their movie and never going to see the super hero movie?...

I’m not saying that your worth is completely determined by how confident or fun you are (that’s very far from the truth)....you’re a multi dimensional and very worthy person, but yeah, the reality is that being entertaining does give you a one-up in social scenarios.

She essentially wants you to fill the empty void of no self love in herself....She wants the comfort and affection (hugs and kind words) but without any effort. 

I’ve never seen my mom as happy as when she finally removed everything off her plate (that she thought she wanted but didn’t like the responsibility that came with it) and raising her two new dogs.

My parents were wealthy and had my brother and I not realizing the work and commitment it takes to raise two kids and they weren’t into it at all. They didnt want to teach us anything and always acted like we were an exhausting burden. They were overwhelmed and took the stress they caused out on us to so we became the most compliant and overly considerate people. I started having mental health problems from the environment and my parents turned on me and would often blame my misery on being “spoiled” (I didn’t really have super nice things as a kid...it was nice getting new clothes every Christmas and birthday and not having to worry about dentist appointments.....but they did pay for college which I know is huge and I’m very grateful for) but.....they weren’t emotionally supportive the whole time I was in college unless I made every decision that they wanted to for themselves (it wasn’t like, their good advice that I was ignoring....there weren’t smart financial choices being “forced” on me.....it was more them wanting to live vicariously through me because they did both grow up poor....I was praised when i went to the state college that was like the fantasy my mom always wanted but then I was RIPPED TO PIECES when I transferred to a college I actually really wanted to go to). They were extremely cruel to me. My anxiety was acting up when they were driving me in to drop me off at the new school and my dad yelled at me that I was going to end up in jail (???? I was the quietest, most mousey person that made A’s and B’s and never so much as had a detention!). They were being so shitty that I told them I didn’t need their help and to just leave drop me infront if the building and leave (they took off like bandits with no interest in my new school or roommates). That was how they left me and I didn’t see them until Thanksgiving......They cut me down the whole time I was in that school and made me doubt myself (I went to school for something that was arguably really difficult but very far from impossible). It took its toll on me and my self esteem was all messed up and I had a breakdown and had absolutely no confidence in myself . To which ignited their hatred even more and all the blame was put on me. 

I did have emotional problems which I’m sure was very hard annoying for them to deal with but...it’s not very hard to trace that back to their choices. I mean, I might have been a naturally shy person no matter who raised me (not sure) but the degree that it got to is frankly really bad (I’ve been doing a lot better the past couple of years though! Learned a lot in therapy that will stay with me forever(.

They had me because they wanted me to serve their needs and any shred of independence made them take their love away."

I’ve been training myself to get into the habit of seeing if there was anything I did wrong for awhile now but I really like that you point out that if I did my best, that I should back off and focus on something else. I have a tendency of beating myself up nonstop, but you’re right, sometimes I stink at communication or whatever else that leads to fights but as long as I’m doing my best....what else can be done? I read articles and self help books about all sort of stuff. Therapy.

I had one other disagreement besides you but it’s okay for me not to agree with someone and explain my own perspective. I appreciate advice and any well wishes others have, but not everyone is great at giving it or will lead into a need for more explanation. 

I’ve received about 80 likes on this post so there most be something very universal and true about having trouble sharing a small space and being isolated. There are also several people who commented that they have an otherwise nice relationship, but that yes, they are having trouble with the isolation. 

I do apologize for my tone originally though in my first response to you. I think you might have even felt disrespected which I suspect was the real issue here. I was being too casual while I was flustered with so many responses  and should have probably maintained more of straightforward way of speaking."

relationship_advice,fl7xmx6,t1_fl7tb01,1584911562.0,"Okay, I went through and reread my comments and you are right in the case that I messed up with you. I was getting lost in all the comments and got what I said to you wrong. There are some people that responded  recommending to breakup to my post (Not from our chain though so again, you are right) and then I misread one of the other comments (I’m really not sure what this other girl is saying though. I’ve admitted that my anxiety is really bad and I do take full accountability for my part of the problem. She’s demanding to know if my diagnoses were given by licensed professionals and she is skipping around trying to get me from every angle.... ). 

But yes, I’m sorry, this is difficult for me because there’s so many people and I’m starting to mix things up. But I understand that I was wrong in my response to you specifically. 

Going back to you though, I did respond with my point of view to what the others were saying and just because I didn’t agree with them, doesn’t mean I didn’t listen or consider what they were saying . In my original post, I stated that we had been having problems.....and then most of them just reiterated that it looks like we have problems as if I didn’t realize that.....and then many of them I felt like were implying that if you aren’t doing well in a very cramped space under these conditions that indicates your relationship “isn’t strong to begin with” or “indicative of probelms” which I felt like was kind of unsympathetic as well as inaccurate (I gave the example of my childhood turtle killing the other turtles we had to prove that this goes beyond relationship troubles....I was basically begging for sympathy bringing that up and exposing that this need for personal space is actually a real need for many people....like, those other two turtles were okay, but the third one couldn’t handle that situation and that’s how people can be too).  

I think it’s great that so many people are doing well during this but I’m just trying to point out that not everyone handles isolation in small spaces super great and that I’m really looking more for advice as to how to reduce the fighting"

You’re trying to gaslight me, you know that? That’s a very toxic and sometimes abusive behavior. I take full and complete responsibility for the issues that my anxiety has caused and I’m doing everything in my power (including trying to use this community) to minimize my anxiety.

It seems you’re not reading what I’m saying and are just trying to demonize me....I you might have some sort of personal issue that you’re projecting onto me. Also, maybe educate yourself in anxiety because it is a very common struggle that many people have.

Like, for example, one time he injured his wrist really badly and it was a highly stressful and dramatic situation and I had to drive him to a clinic and I literally read open hour times that weren’t there which resulted in us pulling up to a closed facility that we had to leave, and missed a bunch of turns because I couldn’t process the street signs. Honestly, probably shouldn’t have driven like that. And when I finally managed to get us to the right turn I just stopped the car and we walked the rest of the way. We were like, 12 plaza buildings away but that’s how hard it is for me to think or take things in when I’m at most anxious. Why didn’t I drop him off at the front?....I have no idea. I can look back at that whole situation and be super blamey and call myself an inconsiderate idiot but I was in survival fight/flight mode and apparently REALLY wanting to do the flighting option if I stopped the car and just wanted to get out....I apologized of course and he told me my iq points drop about 70 points when I’m anxious. After I calmed down I went and moved the car to a spot right in front of the building so he didn’t have to walk that whole way again.

So....I’ve been doing my best to calm down my anxiety. It’s not so much about prioritizing or minimizing his need to feel heard. I feel super bad all of the time because I am anxious a lot"

Part of the reason why we became so strained in the first place, is because there has already been a ton of external stress that has happened alongside our relationship ( that didn’t have anything to do with us together directly). We’ve already been “tested” a hundred times over. And a week or two of not going into work for most people who would be on reddit (mainly younger couples that are in good health and are childless) isn’t really enough to probably push anyone over the edge yet."

relationship_advice,fl60ree,t1_fl5tlxr,1584850906.0,"Every couple is different. Some people need a lot of personal space and alone time while others can be glued to the side of their partner and not even notice. It doesn’t mean the relationship itself is flawed but that one or both people might have needs that exceed certain conditions (such as being isolated in a small space during the pandemic). 

Others might just have poor communication or coping skills to stress, but there again, it has nothing to do with the relationship itself. They used to joke about how many couples got a divorce after just remodeling part of their home (like a kitchen or a bathroom).....stress can do crazy things. 

My partner and I have been having trouble (like I said) but have been working on it and improving prior to the pandemic. So like, yes, I had pointed that out in my post that we were having trouble (so I’m not sure why you pointed to this as if you were suggesting that might be the case). 

But you know what? We also both grew up in houses and find apartment living incredibly depressing (we are both bigger people....he’s always breaking stuff by accident and just in general it feels cramped). Like, animals will actually start to kill eachother if you put them in close quarters. I had a turtle as a kid and he killed the other two because it was the early 90’s before the internet and we had no idea we didn’t give them a big enough aquarium."

I’m sorry that you felt the need to sabotage your job subconsciously!

BPD,fl28zw4,t1_fl1t0p8,1584745622.0,"Are you in therapy? Your college should have some resources.

look....the good thing (and bad thing) is that it sounds like you have a lot of work ahead of you, but that’s all it is....it’s work. You’ve basically created a laundry list of trauma from what you wrote in your comments and you’re going to have to go through the process of fully accepting each thing that has happened and then put the work in to rewire your thoughts and habits until your symptoms subside. 

That’s how it was for me (I’m obviously not fully recovered yet but am doing much better). I had a looooooong list of all kinds of trauma to get through and I had several diagnoses, and I’ve honestly, also had some luck (random people who wanted to help me). It was completely overwhelming and when you start out you’re just kind of like “I am so fucked and I’m so sad and annoyed that literally everyone is mad at me all of the time. Wtf?!”....but there is so much hope. There are answers and resources EVERYWHERE. 

You’ll eventually get what you put in (though dont get be discouraged if you go backwards sometimes while you go forward....that’ll likely happen a lot)

I’m 33 and I was only diagnosed with this last year. And I have had sooooo many people upset with me. I’ve been fired. I’ve been dumped. I’ve been ghosted. I’ve been mocked. I’ve literally been attacked. I’ve had terrifying health problems from all the stress. 

But....guess what? I’m finally starting to get some peace. I’m finally starting to get some respect. I’m finally feeling happy for no reason sometimes because things are going better with others and inside my head. 

One of the bigger things for me was to start reading the material that is intended for people who don’t have BPD but have someone in their life that is close to them that does. Seeing the illness from the outside....and how it effects others stopped a lot of the illogical negative thoughts that would make me act out. Not all the time but it helped me to become more conscious and mindful of what I was doing. It might help you to understand and even forgive your fraternity brothers. And others with whom you’ve argued with. 

CBT has also been incredibly helpful. There’s a free phone app called “Woebot” that is absolutely life changing...download it. Talk therapy. YouTube (learn about BPD...I also sat around and listened to people’s emotional journeys until I started to understand people as a whole and how any kind of trauma effects the brain). BetterHelp. 5HTP. I have purchased like, every psychology self help book on the planet (which you probably have easy access to at your school library). 

Literally, think of it as another course you’re taking. 

Join different group. Go to church. GIVE BACK (help others). 

Exercise. Stand outside in the sun for at least ten minutes a day. Eat right. Drink enough water. Start paying attention to things that trigger your emotions (like not getting enough sleep). Keep a gratitude journal (are you able-bodied? Do you like having all your toes and fingers? Grateful to know how to drive and have the ability to see? Grateful you have a bed to sleep on instead some 3rd world dirty floor?)

I have all the sympathy in the world for you. Most people with BPD have really bad stories to tell and it’s no picnic. I understand your emotionally charged reactions causing people to freak out around you. But sympathy can’t really fix anything in your life and no one else but you has the power to do that ....I went several years waiting around just hoping for everything to go back to normal. Then I found some people who wanted to help but I leaned on them way too much and wanted their sympathy to heal me. But eventually I grew tired and I want things for myself really bad (marriage, vacations, a house). 

Do all of this stuff though and give it your all. This wasn’t just a list of suggestions to try out. I’ve done all of these things ALL DAY, every day for the last three years because I am 100% sick of it. I hope you find the same level of motivation. Be a BPD soldier. 

Good luck and super good vibes going your way."

Go wrong when I let my guard down. Just sometimes. But I’d fixate on the bad  and didn’t want to continue to be vulnerable to let downs. But....I went through some really terrifying health problems the past couple of years and it made me realize and adopt more of a “fuck it, I don’t care what happens..I just want to be happy” mantra.

There was a guy in high school who started putting gifts in my locker and I threw them away in the girls bathroom and ghosted hard because I just couldn’t process it and it was too much for me. Those were sweet intentions though and I see where I was thinking straight now. But it’s still very much apart of me. I still have physical and mental habits. Thought patterns. But I can see that there’s something off about this now"
BPD,fkzs9ar,t1_fkz7qei,1584678865.0,"I think it’s a “self fulfilling prophecy” though. Like, whatever you think about....you attract. So if you think things are going to go wrong...they might just go wrong. But even aside from that, things will always, of course, go wrong because that’s just life. I got stuck in this confusion for so long and I’m just starting to break free. I’m trying to stop doing this and I’ve just recently gotten a lot better at allowing myself to be happy and even kind of free at times. It’s kind of like if you went to The Bahamas but you stayed inside your hotel the whole time because you thought it might rain at some point. But....you miss 5 or 6 days of perfect weather. I was probably the worst offender ever. But This new logic is starting to set in and my guard has been going down and I feel a little bit happier even though I’m very far from what is considered healthy/normal."

I agree with you about feeling like things are too good to be true, and so I sort of just wait for the bad to kind of confirm that belief that it was a good idea not put my emotional guard down. 

I’ve been thinking more and I feel like there might be an element of feeling equal to others too. Like, in regular life, most people can maintain their health and happiness on a level that I don’t seem to be able to, but when things go wrong...there’s like an excuse as to why I’m not at that same high level. And maybe this ties into my self worth/self love issues too as though maybe I don’t think I deserve true peace and happiness?"

Eventually I just got so exhausted from things going wrong that I stopped having a huge emotional reaction and withdrawaling for weeks/months, and instead, it gave me a weird sort of confidence I guess. And now it’s more like a problem that I’m furious with than something that I sit around shaming and blaming myself for or loafing around listless (for the most part anyway). 

It’s like one of those puzzles where the whole thing is one color (like a picture of an ocean) and where pieces fit together even if it’s wrong just to confuse you....that’s what social events feel like for me. 

Truth be told though, it is really nice to have this push from my boyfriend. I mean, I HATE this about me so I’m not changing it for him, but..,,feeling like I might run out of time definitely pushes further faster"

This makes complete sense though. 

All the more reason why I want to conquer this so badly though. My attitude is causing a bad reaction, so if I can work past the trauma....that will go away.

socialanxiety,fkjqwfi,t1_fkjjtdk,1584255652.0,"That’s a really nice compliment and I appreciate the boost you’re trying to give me, but women have also been pretty rude and dismissive and it’s more of a disgust vibe rather than admiration. I’ve seen the occasional look of concerned pity too. I feel like it’s something else than jealously and I think I might know what it was (I reflected for awhile before replying).....I think besides me not acknowledging others enough (so they’re misinterpreting my shyness as a lack of interest or care for them), but....I think they also perceive me (and maybe you too) as someone who is sort of taking what they have for granted. Like, they see me and that I don’t have any physical problems (which includes never having much acne), they see i know how to how to dress, and that I show up to things rather than hiding and.....maybe they interpret all of that as I don’t appreciate any of it. So kind of like what you said “if she looks this good (but more focused toward health or whatever) then she should be treating me like ‘x’ but she’s ruining what she has and I feel bewildered that’s someone would choose to do that”. I know they’re probably think “if I was that skinny/didn’t have acne/etc I would respect what I had and be happy.”
I feel like I get it and I can sympathize with them. Seeing someone go through a tough time is generally not fun in general especially when you’re doing an activity that’s supposed to be fun. But the problem is that’s just simply not what’s happening at all. Trauma doesn’t work that way. I am terrified of new people, completely untrusting and often paranoid, and I’m always expecting someone to up and abandon me or treat me in some horrible way"
socialanxiety,fkja2gd,t1_fkj12v4,1584240161.0,"That does sound very familiar to me! And I’ve felt resentful and falsely accused. 

I can see why they’d treat a man this way but I guess I really just don’t get why they’re hostile with me specifically because the first event I was talking (where I went to that special dinner) I was wearing a beautiful light pink dress....could I have been any less threatening?? It was very hostile. Imagine yelling at someone in a pink dress that you’ve never talked to before that seemed afraid to begin with....weird, right? I just can’t wrap my head around it. 

I really think it might be maybe a nurturing thing. People expect women to take care of them socially and emotionally but I’m way too full of trauma and mistrust for that. But still, what’s with the anger?"

I’ve been left behind for a lot of things, but I’ve learned not to take everything personally.  a few things that might have happend .....1) there could always be a perfectly good explanation (is someone there that you don’t get along with? Did the couple only allow for a certain amount of people?...your other friend s might have actually asked for those seats) 
2) there might be a real misunderstanding (have you ever expressed a disinterest in marriage/weddings or anything about the bride or groom that would put them off?)
There’s also a very important consideration here that most shy people don’t think about.....do YOU seem interested in them or going to a wedding? Did you ask about their lives or maybe even try to help with their planning since you’re so close? Or do they take you to things and you don’t participate or maybe even have emotional outbursts?......that kind of stuff comes off as you’re not actually interested in them or the activity they’re doing.....they might literally think you’re not really into an event like that OR them in general if your social anxiety stops you from focusing on them enough (people want to feel cared about)
3) if none of that sounds right...this one may hurt the most but.....maybe you need to look in the mirror. Are you a positive person? Do you encourage others? Or do you make others feel like things are difficult or impossible? Fo you poo-poo their ideas and ambitions? Do you make them take care of too many of your problems? I’m not trying to accuse you of anything here....just spit balling some very common things people do that they don’t realize are turning others off from them. I’ve done all of these things by the way and I’m doing a bit better now.

It was all part of the process and I used to be like...so detached from reality and so completely helpless and just plain crazy compared to how I am today. I’m proud of the progress I’ve made. I want to be someone that other people want to be around (and who he specifically would want to date), but I know I’m not there yet (but I could be very close)."
BPD,fkhgugb,t1_fkh0cnf,1584198500.0,"Thank you for this 😊 You seem like a very caring person and thank you for making sure I’m okay and for trying to make me feel better. 

You pointing out that I didn’t get much of a response to my post actually made me feel better about myself surprisingly because I didn’t take it as a rejection (something I would have beat myself up for in the past and would have just confirmed to me that I was worthless to others). It was late when I wrote this and I wrote a long post that most people probably thought was too exhausting to read, you know? I can actually think like this now (yay progress). 

To answer some of your questions, I am able to take care of myself a good deal. I eat right (most of the time), exercise and I’m always therapying myself with self help books (and other resources). I do have A LOT of trouble saving money because of mental exhaustion/confusion and some other big hangups like that, but I do what I can and it took me a LONG time just to get to this place where I’m doing all of this health stuff almost second nature. I hope the same for you. You mentioned that you can’t do these things and I’m not sure what your situation is but I sympathize and can tell you that not only did it take me awhile to get to this place but that I went literally years assuming that it was hopeless and probably impossible. If you want to ever hear how I did it, just ask. 

My boyfriend won’t go to couples therapy with me or read the books...he’s not closed off though (just overwhelmed because he’s ALSO been taking care of family members in need). Like, even though I’m terrible at communication....he’s not and he helps us talk through a lot like we would in therapy. And he listens to me when I tell him what I’ve learned about BPD. The full truth is that he can’t really handle a lot of it though. I know he’s really tired of having a girlfriend that always has some sort of struggle. 

At the end of the day though, this is my issue and I can see how when I improve something about myself, how our interactions improve as well too (and with others). I can’t really ask much more of him and he’s told me he’s completely spent and is focusing on himself. but yeah, I am completely emotionally dependent on him. 

I’ve been improving a lot and I felt like I’m on the verge of having a giant breakthrough but I fear he’s about to leave me and what that will do to my motivation."
askwomenadvice,fkf3bws,t1_fkf296z,1584126198.0,"I agree that I don’t want to push myself to do things I don’t want to do but those two times that I was drunk I really did enjoy it (I have social fears to the point where I’ve convinced myself that Im a huge introvert but....one or two drinks or even just a really confident boosting day always surprise me and show me that it’s basically all I actually want). And from what I understand, it could be a dominance thing but it could also be like....a thing you do because it feels good and it’s like a performance that turns your man on which seems like it could be really hot. And I think men really desire it because that’s what most normal porn is where the woman is ontop for at least part of it. I don’t think they feel dominated. I think it could even be like, a nurturing thing?"

ProgressiveGrowth,fkdh0rk,t3_fhkqx3,1584078462.0,The right side. You look so much healthier and vibrant.
BPD,fjpk6pd,t1_fh4lpah,1583553006.0,Same! I know it’s unhealthy but I feel so much calmer than when I try to do those kinds of things in real life.
socialskills,fjmdvrk,t1_fjmbve2,1583467941.0,"This really helped me, thank you! I just realized that I’m sort of punishing everyone in a way for the wrong doing of a select few. I’m literally changed forever"
socialskills,fjm93wt,t1_fjm2u18,1583464497.0,"Thank you for the advice 😊. I don’t want to be fake (I don’t like insincerity either). I just want to learn how to let go of the fear I guess? And to pick peoples’ brains who DO legitimately love meeting people to see through their eyes 

Im crazy though so if I were truly not to be fake at all....I’d be crossing my arms and rapid firing questions to see what kind of person they are, LOL (i’ve met a lot of creeps out there that seem normal). I’m very untrusting. 

I’m someone who will barely talk to someone new for a few weeks or even months . Just kind of observe them with others and THEN approach them if I even can at that point (once im sure they’re kind and I might have overheard a thing or two we have in common). The problem is that, that’s often seen as incredibly rude and they might not even be receptive at that point because it’s offensive to wait that long. 

Which to me is like.....what, why?? I like to date before I get married, you know what I mean? (this is an analogy).......There’s so many scenarios in life like at a job or meeting your boyfriends friends and family where you’re expected to bond as fast as possible and enjoy yourself and be fun for possibly hours with these new people . It’s like you enter a bunch of arranged marriages. But like....no. Just like with dating, I want to get a coffee with you and then maybe not see you for a couple of days. There’s so much forced interaction. How can you not be fake? How do so many people actually enjoy this? 

I’m venting though. Sry."
socialskills,fjlki7l,t1_fjlj5z3,1583448384.0,"Yes, there is so much pressure to be super friendly when you are female! And I’ve spent days worth of hours trying to find information on how women socialize specifically and help for us (most social advice seems to be either for your job or men trying to talk to women). 

I actually found this amazing woman online that has created something called “People School” (it’s extremely expensive so I haven’t resorted to that yet) BUT she’s only produced one small YouTube video for women specifically as far as I know. It’s the role of the “alpha female” to walk around and make sure everyone is talking to eachother (helping them too if they need it) and basically the second that lady walks a way things get awkward and quiet.....it was extremely fascinating. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HQQ1ytxdLik

It’s interesting but still not super helpful though"

socialskills,fic0jzw,t1_fibsrm1,1582334617.0,"You are absolutely correct about their motives but I realized this past year that everyone is full of judgment (including me!) and that I should have more patience and empathy even for haters. AND I started studying people/social behavior and realized that there are happy ways of dealing with conflict and assertiveness and those are almost always the better feeling way to go..... I spent a looooooong time in my youth blowing out SO MUCH energy on “righting wrongs,” but I started to notice at some point that  it never truly gave me the results I wanted. I was angry, you know, that someone wanted to make me unhappy, but.....then I just made myself more unhappy by yelling at them or even sitting down and dissecting all the logic of the situation until they apologized (later in my development). I started to take notice of how other people handle conflicts and there’s a lot of people out there that are SUPER cool and they don’t break a sweat or even change their mood when handling other people’s hate...I want to be cool like that! And If I can avoid every bad feeling somehow....then I’d prefer it (I’m a little bit older now and I’ve had enough exhausting challenges that I now want as much positivity and for things to be as easy as possible)."
socialskills,fib78sp,t1_fiavgpo,1582316046.0,"That’s a wonderful suggestion! Thanks :) Yes, the tone has to be friendly! And a question says everything without actually saying anything. Brilliant!

And you’re absolutely right that this is an issue of establishing a boundary. Which is why is feels so gross when I would just go along with things (or watching Jessica Simpson do the same in the example I gave). 

It’s important to get respect from the world otherwise it has a way hurting you more-and-more over time until you start feeling angry toward others for no reason (which I definitely went through). But also to achieve this somehow in a healthy way and remaining happy. Thanks!"
