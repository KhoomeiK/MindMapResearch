Healthyhooha,fr14zas,t3_gm19zz,1589813354.0,"As someone prone to yeast infections, I understand your pain!

Of course, first and foremost try to see if you can get checked out to confirm it's 100% yeast. I'm at a point where I pretty much know and keep a treatment at home in case.

I find the creams don't do anything for me except relieve the crazy itching. What works best is the 3 day tablets for me. I've been told 1 day would be find but I had instances where it didn't do the trick, so 3 days is just the safest. I did have a raging yeast infection once that doing the 3 day treatment didn't cure it, so I had to take an oral capsule. My doctor said it was common that sometimes just the tablet won't cure it, but an oral capsule usually does the trick if it lingers.

For future, some things I've changed to help with decreasing the frequency of yeast infections:

* Only wear pads during your period, and even then, make sure they are ""natural"" pads. I basically gave up pads and only switched my lingers to cotton/more organic
* I started using a menstrual cup. The only issue is if you do get a yeast infection while you have a menstrual cup, it is basically gone. Some users say you can boil it and soak in hydrogen peroxide but I just don't want to risk it.
* 100% cotton underwear basically all the time.
* Decrease yoga pants usage. I did live in them quite a bit but they don't really let your area breathe. Looser / more breathable pants helped
* Vaginal probiotics. This one sounds super weird but it basically helped re-balance the pH in my system since it was happening so frequently."

This is a site where you can put in an ingredient and it'll let you know on a scale how ""harmful"" it is. I would strongly recommend to look at the extra details aside from the number. An ingredient can be rated ""good"" but due to the fact only 2 studies were done that showed no results. An ingredient be can be rated ""bad"" but if you look into the studies, they could just suggest bad things in a weird sample size, just rats, done in 70s, etc. So this is more of a basic guide and then you can dig further.

At the end of the day, I find in the ""clean"" beauty world there's a lot of gray areas. It is up to you to do research and decide what you feel comfortable with! Also never hesitate to ask companies to clarify their sources of ingredients / what an ingredient is doing there."

Just due to how my body is, no matter the fold the cup will not just ""open"" automatically and I always have to get it to open. As some have mentioned, a common one is to run your finger all around the cup to make sure there are no dents. This doesn't for me 'cause my hands just don't fit that way, I have a tilted cervix and it goes up too high where usually I only feed the bottom part of the cup, which won't tell the full story if it's open.

The method the helps me is pushing against my vaginal walls to give it ""room"" to open. Sometimes I'll feel the pop but other times I won't. Then, for good measure, I actually tug at my cup (learned this from another redditor in this sub!). If I pull at the stem and it is giving me resistance, I know a suction has been created. If it feels like I can pull it right out, then the cup wasn't fully open. Sometimes I'll push some more, otherwise, I'll just re-insert it again.

It definitely is a huge learning curve and I'm still trying to find the right cup for me! I'm finding I do get cramping / pressure from the ones that create too much of a suction / too firm. So finding the right firmness, and also diameter for your cervix, is important."

Also keep in mind, since the derm seems to be recommending lower strength retinol, it'll take longer to see results. A good thing to keep in mind is it took a long time for your skin to get the way it is now, so it'll take that time to revert it back too if youre not using extreme measures.

NaturalBeauty,fi0r17c,t1_fhy2xmf,1582043019.0,"It's an odd time right now as we're more aware of ingredients. As someone that does a lot of research, this is my take on it:

There are a few parabens that are a big no-no for sure. However, those have mostly been taken out of everyday products since it is deemed as no good for our bodies. Most parabens you see in products are approved by the FDA, used in small quantities (hopefully) and are there to keep nasty things like mold and bacteria from forming. There are over 100 parabens so people can't distinguish between them, most companies just opt for paraben free. There are definitely alternatives to paraben as a preservative that will also keep away mold and bacteria.

FDA also recently came out with a study saying parabens do stay in our bloodstream. What does that mean? No idea. The amount is small and unharmful but that also depends how many products you're using daily, those percentages and how it builds in our blood. They suggest for pregnant/breast-feeding mothers to avoid parabens.

For me:  
I have the financial means, education and access to products that don't use parabens so I go for the ""better safe than sorry"" route. However, that isn't to say someone that uses products with parabens are obviously killing themselves. It really is about education and deciding for yourself what you are comfortable with. It's like, a bag of chips isn't good for you but I'm going to allow myself to have it once a month. For someone else, they might say, I'm not going to have it at all."

Otherwise, even if it looks clean, there is a marker that lingers and she will go right back and pee in that spot."
CatAdvice,fgjq7f2,t3_eyw64i,1580849236.0,"I think it is all about expectations and if someone is ready to have a cat. It is a HUGE adjustment and expectations need to be met. So I would sit down and have a serious conversation with your family to see if a cat is appropriate for their lifestyle.

Cats get a rep for letting them ""just be"" but especially a kitten, like you said, more training needs to be done.  
I would recommend having a litter box at every level of the home. This way, she doesn't need to search for the 1. Like you said, in the beginning, best to confine her to 1 level even until she gets used to things.   
The cat HAS to be played with. A kitten has SO much energy and if it can't go somewhere like play, then the couch/door/plastic/whatever becomes their toy. That's how things get destroyed. I also invested in some kitty tape where it is double sided, and I put it on items they started to scratch to teach them no. Something I learned from Jackson Galaxy, where you have a ""no"", have a yes. So I would put the tape on my couch corner, but then have a scratching post right next to it. So when they go to scratch, they learn no for the couch but here's something I'm allowed to scratch on. There are bitter apple sprays too for a more short-term thing.

I know the spraying bottle method isn't loved by some, but that really taught my kittens to stay off the counters. They still do it now from time-to-time if I leave food out, but in my mind, that's on me. If you put something smelling SUPER good, I'll go for it too.

Cats actually love routines. Feeding at the same time, playing at the same time, all of that would let them know it is coming instead of ""searching"" for it if that makes sense.

As for allergies, as someone that had 3 cats with allergies, it was a nightmare for a while. But yes to taking allergy meds when needed, washing sheets and clothes regularly, vacuuming regularly, brushing regularly. Also having an allergy pillow and mattress cover made a HUGE difference. I was able to breathe way better at night once I introduced an allergy specific pillow cover. 

I definitely find short hair more allergy inducing cause the allergen has ""less"" to travel and thus gets into things a lot easier. Long-haired cats are kind of able to ""trap""/keep it all in a bit better due to their floofiness. If they can tolerate baths, giving them one will help too."
CatAdvice,fgj8mkh,t3_eyql5g,1580839133.0,"I unfortunately can't give you an answer as to why she started hairballs but as someone who has a cat who is super prone to hairballs, along with the regular brushing (I find using a furminator-type brush to be most useful. Just be careful not to overbrush as I find it can really just strip them of ALL fur), switching to a grain-free diet made a huge difference. I have no idea why or how it works but once I did he, he went from having hairballs weekly to once every few months? And I find when he does have it, it is totally on me for not brushing him more often around that time."
CanSkincare,fggbqif,t1_fgg5ix1,1580758498.0,"Assuming you're talking about the Coola, they actually have a Tinted version. It has 0 actual coverage, but it's made so if you do have a deeper skin tone, it won't show up white. Their regular cucumber one blends in pretty nicely compared to a lot on the market but I can definitively see it leaving some white on the deep skin tones."
CanSkincare,fgeagv6,t3_exuwi9,1580695087.0,Kiehl's Super Fluid was my go-to before I switched to all mineral sunscreens. Now I use Coola but they only do up to SPF 30 for face.

CatAdvice,fg6k7au,t1_fg50rvb,1580570164.0,"I would say of the 5 or so 5 hour trips I did with them, it was used once.

I have 3 litter boxes at home so usually I just clean one before I go and grab and go. I'm also typically staying over the weekend at my parent's home when I do this, so they'll need a litter box regardless during the stay. So yeah it really depends what works for you!"
CatAdvice,fg4c2av,t3_ewsqw3,1580500568.0,"[Jackson Galaxy had a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERllZYZuaOE) about it which I think is a great start.

I also look for harnesses that is more of a ""jacket"" than just a rope-like one. So something like [this](https://www.amazon.ca/Eagloo-Harnesses-Adjustable-Reflective-Comfortable/dp/B07WR6CV5K/ref=asc_df_B07WR6CV5K/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=338535237582&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6198397803432980207&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9000676&hvtargid=pla-847370856185&psc=1) where it goes around their neck and behind their front paws. It's a little harder to slip out of. 

For me, it took a long time for the cat to get outside. For the first month, he would just flop over and refuse to move or would attach the leash part thinking it's a toy, or start running backgrounds randomly. So just be patient!"
CatAdvice,fg3t3dm,t3_ewquif,1580489088.0,"As someone that has let her cats roam in the car before, don't do it for safety reasons. I didn't know better. One of my cats would actually curl into my lap and while it was cute, also dangerous in distracted driving / sometimes he tried to get down to my feet where the pedals are. Also I read how if I got into an accident (knock on wood) and they were free roaming, it'll basically be instant death. It's best if they are in a carrier and then you strap that carrier in with a seatbelt.

During pitstops I let them out and roam the car. I also left a litter box on the floor of the back seats so if they needed to use it, they could. Sometimes I would give them some treats and also some water if they needed. 

When you get to the hotel, just try to secure any areas that you can't reach but would be great hiding spots before letting them out. So under the bed (I would just put up blockades with things so they can't get under there) or weird crevices. My cats also get SUPER anxious in any new setting (which is when the sedative will probably help) but just make sure there are treats + blankets with their smell and always having the carrier open as their safe space.

Good luck!"
NaturalBeauty,fg3sazi,t1_fg3gawi,1580488598.0,"That is perfectly fine. The main thing is to look at ingredients of each of those products, even from well established brands.

An easy way too is to go to [https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/) and plug in the product to see where it rates or there is an app called ThinkDirty but I find their brands limited.

I also want to say this is an easy starting point. You really need to look into each ingredient and check the research. Was it only 1-2 studies that said it was bad and the rest inconclusive? Is there barely any research on the ingredient? What percentage did the brand manufacture it at?"
NaturalBeauty,fg3r9ki,t3_ewd3kc,1580487954.0,"So talc is quite up in the air at the moment... if you deep dive into more of the research, the main issue was some talc wasn't properly regulated, which left traces of asbestos, which is what would have ""caused cancer"". However, especially today, talc is pretty heavily regulated. If I remember correctly, a lot of Johnson & Johnson's lawsuit was based on products people used back when it wasn't regulated + they totally did not disclose the use of talc in some of their ingredients, which led to the lawsuit. They did completely eff up on their part but I wouldn't be panicked if my loose powder had talc in it nowadays. Of course, it is up to everyone to choose what they feel comfortable with.

I totally agree with you there needs to be more regulation. Look at the recent issue that has come up with chemical sunscreens and how further testing is being conducted. I think another issue is 1 product might be within ""reasonable limits"" of whatever percentage the FDA approves, but no one is thinking what happens if we have 5 products with that same percentage, layered. How does our body react to that? So that 1 product might be ""safe"", but when layered without ""safe"" products, it might be not.

I do have to admit that I felt the documentary did a little bit of fear-mongering in some aspects but I understand where they are coming from. My own approach always has been do your own research, read the ingredients on your products, get familiar with common ingredients, and if you can find alternatives that make you feel more comfortable/you can afford it, do it."
CanSkincare,fg3kxio,t1_fg3jjs6,1580483984.0,"Second this. Best all mineral sunscreen that I've tried. Basically turns into almost like a powder finish. Amazing under makeup. They have a tinted version (no coverage, just to avoid looking pasty) and the regular cucumber one."
NaturalBeauty,fg3klmc,t3_ewbzpp,1580483767.0,"The leaving white marks could be possibly you're putting on too much / not letting it melt into your skin before going about your day. Though I find that happens more with stick deodorants and I usually use the cream ones to make sure it's really rubbed in!

I find depending where I am in my hormonal cycle, different products work (which is annoying since I have 4 deos on the go but I have accepted I am a smell person). With natural deos, I find the max is about the work day (6-7 hours), then I need to top up. Some of my favourites: Soapwalla, Meow Meow Tweet (though has been hit and miss for people), and Black Chicken Remedies (Australian brand). 

Recently, the only thing that has worked is usually an essential oil-based deo/perfume. Be careful though as some people have sensitivities with EOs and will break out in a rash. I use the Poetic Pits from Living Libations and then also an alcohol-based perfume from a local brand called Lvnea here in Canada."
ottawa,fg03ay7,t1_ffzngdw,1580399278.0,"Just to add to this quickly, Le Nordik recently implemented a reservation-only system. So you go online and reserve a time, so no more long lineups! I personally like this a lot better since I avoided going there previously because of the long line ups and possibility of being turned away. I do find peak times still really busy inside the spa itself and sometimes you have to walk around to find a pool/sauna/steam room that isn't over-crowded."
NaturalBeauty,ffui5x7,t3_etl0s1,1580242462.0,"Lots of great brands mentioned but just to add my two cents:

Ilia Beauty is one of those pretty well established in the community, you can order online at Sephora, and they do great makeup. Most well known for their lipsticks! Their Limitless Mascara is the first all-natural mascara I've tried that still SOMEWHAT held my curl on my sad Asian lashes.

Hynt Beauty is great and she comes from a background of having cancer so trying to keep her products as clean as possible.

Han is a great brand aiming to bring more affordable clean beauty into the market. I think they are great products for the price.

Fitglow does a skincare + makeup infusion and has some great hits. However, the price point is iffy. Some of the better stuff I've used in clean beauty but not sure if I can justify the price.

Elate is the only brand I know that does really sustainable packaging where you can have refills as well. However, I find their products hit-and-miss. Most are just ""fine"". (Stay away from their lipsticks though)

Kosas is another great brand that they now carry at Sephora. Their foundation isn't for everyone but more known for their cheek products anyways.

Olio e Osso makes great cheek products and I've been dying to try their new liquid lip.

Gressa is also very clean but sadly, their products have not worked out for me for some reason or another.

Ere Perez is an Australian brand and I love their stuff. Stay away from eyeshadows though... I find them meh.

Lily Lolo is more accessible, a brand from Britain and their products are fine. Nothing out of this world but will do its job.

Rituelle de Fille got a lot of hype for a little bit because they have a very edgy approach but I've heard many people say, myself included, that is wasn't worth the price point. I have to say though, their concealer is awesome and I wish they made a bigger one because I used it like a foundation and it was done so fast.

Inika is another Australian brand that does really good quality makeup. I love their BB cream.

If you happen to be in Canada, Urban Minerals out of Toronto is amazing. She's a makeup artist and started with powder foundations (one of the best I've tried and I don't even like powder foundation) and just released some amazing lipsticks.

Clove + Hallow has some nice stuff and I do like their liquid lips. Their foundation was raved about in the community when it was released... I didn't try it because it has coconut derivatives in it that breaks me out.

Spela is another also pigmented liquid lip brand.

Haven't tried but hear people talk about tons:  
Vapour (just did a re-brand), W3ll People, RMS, 100% Pure, Pacifica, Sappho, Saint Cosmetics, Aether Beauty (beautiful sustainable palettes, I would pick some up if I didn't hoard palettes in my conventional lifetime), Au Naturale, Lawless (sold at Sephora and I didn't love it tbh), Ecobrow, Mineral Fusion, The Organic Skin Co, Thrive"
NaturalBeauty,ffug7rk,t3_ev8wgj,1580241295.0,"Can't get at Sephora but the Eminence Stone Crop Gel Wash is my go-to just because it's so neutral but doesn't strip my skin. Also a little goes such a long way so a bottle lasts me usually 8 months! (I only cleanse at night though)

Otherwise, oil cleansing is a must for me, especially if I wore makeup or sunscreen."
NaturalBeauty,ffcw4dz,t3_esxm6g,1579808497.0,"Witch hazel might just end up drying you out more so I would go with what someone suggested with a hydrosol / flower water. Rose water is always a good one. Adding this step will help a lot with your hydration as you're actually ""hydrating"" your skin vs just moisturizing (trapping in moisture and adding a little bit too). Think of it like drinking a glass of water vs not peeing so you don't dehydrate (okay maybe not the best analogy haha I hope you get what I mean).

Argan oil is also one of my favourites as you can use anywhere -- body, face, hair.

To exfoliate, even just simple honey (can also add sugar but I'm always worried about sourcing.. don't want to use regular white sugar) or oatmeal scrub will do. Otherwise a facial dry brush would mean you don't even need to add a ""product""."
NaturalBeauty,ffchnvv,t3_esmrgf,1579799671.0,[Jao Refresher](https://jaobrand.com/collections/apothecary/products/jao-refresher) has been the best one I've used so far. Comes in several sizes. Not sure where you're located but I've gotten mine at Anthropologie before.
NaturalBeauty,ff9boa5,t3_es8f2f,1579709293.0,"I would say decrease the baking soda and see what happens. As someone sensitive to it, I've used ""low baking soda"" formulas before without developing a rash! However, if I used it everyday for a few months, I find I start getting sensitive near the end. So I definitely think there is an ""exposure/accumulation"" thing going on that I can't quite explain. Maybe it makes us sensitive after a while? So I only use the low baking soda on days I really need it such as long days where I won't go home right after work, those hot summer days, days I know I'll break a sweat, etc.

All other days I used no baking soda formulas that has magnesium. I feel I read either here or somewhere else that it isn't too hard to formulate with that too! So I would look into what magnesium you're suppose to get."

My GP is amazing and will spend time with me and have times gone over the 15 mins. However, she is also on a time crunch and there are other people waiting. To address any upcoming issues or even side effects from say a medication, I have to book another appointment. At this point in time, my GP is booked up about a month in advance or she opens 1-2 time slots where I have to call in at 8:00am sharp on Friday to see if I can get it. If not, it's walk-in doc for the day which is fine, but this is now also a GP that doesn't know my entire case. 

With a naturopath, I might be able to sit with them for longer where they look at all my symptoms as a whole, and spend time on each component. Then I can easily just call my GP/leave a message to check with them to see if x and y is okay for me to take. Or if I know what the naturopath is suggesting isn't insane (aka, cut out diary for a week), I can try it and get some relief before I go in to see my doctor.
