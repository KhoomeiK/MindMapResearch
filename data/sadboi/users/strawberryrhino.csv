ftm,fh0te7v,t1_fh0t3dl,1581207373.0,"it’s been almost two months, yeah. the only thing is my t dose was higher before, but then it was fucking with something in my blood, so my endo lowered my dose. i was on that dose for like 8 months before switching to gel and i was fine, so i’m not sure. 

if this repeats itself though i’ll definitely be talking to my endo to see what’s up."
ftm,fh0t2ll,t3_eyjnnz,1581207250.0,"i started blockers when i was 14, after puberty, with the intention to stop periods and further hip/breast development. and it did stop those. started T a year and a half later. i think i grew half an inch? that’s about it."
ftm,f6w51ya,t3_dt8495,1573216654.0,"I’ve done a bit of flying with binders. US to France, UAE, and Canada to China. So 6-7 hour flight as well as 13-15 hour flights. I never had issues with the body scanners thankfully, but after traveling for 30 hours straight in a binder... you want to take it off.

I suggest trying to find a time you can take it off and wear a big hoodie instead. But if you can’t it won’t be the end of the world—just take it off once you’ve gotten into Ireland. 

Have fun on your trip!"

if they’re an asshole, I plan on telling them I got attacked by a shark."

depression,erlyldv,t3_c2fuf3,1561000482.0,"My parents laughed at me the first time I told them I thought I was depressed. 

There have been a few attempts since then, but I’ve just stopped talking about it. My therapist tried (why else would I be in therapy, I literally need to be diagnosed with something in order for my insurance to pay for it). My parents made an appointment with my primary care doctor, and ignored her advice (which agreed with me and my therapist).

Now that I’m 18 I’ll be having an appointment with a psychiatrist in the next few weeks and hopefully starting medication to finally get somewhere. I won’t be telling them about the appointment or the medication."
