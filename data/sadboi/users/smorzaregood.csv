AnimalCrossing,fplhax7,t1_fpkg91u,1588712697.0,"I’m also disappointed with the villager mechanic. When I play animal crossing, my main focus is interacting with the villagers and completing tasks/trading with them. It feels like every subsequent animal crossing game has dropped in dialogue quality and gotten increasingly generic and repetitive. My first game was wild world, and I’ve played every game released since, and while graphics, design mechanics, and furniture/clothing options get better and better, villagers get more and more bland. I can hardly sense a distinction between half the personality types anymore aside from jock and all the rest. Even then, all the jocks talk about is jogging/muscles. I rarely get asked on errands, and when I do they’re so simple and take hardly any time or grind (for example, every time I’m asked to catch a bug it’s a common or white butterfly). I don’t particularly love or hate any of my villagers anymore because they’re all so.......bleh. Sticks in the mud, no strong feelings about any of them."

My only friend was dismissive and even cruel regarding my emotions, always one-upping me and telling me her problems were worse. My parents were already distraught and confused regarding my lack of social life and the bullying. High school got a little better, but by that time I had already become a pro at disregarding my own emotions completely. My friends loved me because I was “carefree,” “confident,” and I “didn’t care what anyone thought.” I don’t know how to express myself at all now. Even if I try I can’t.

AskReddit,ex2wyw6,t3_cr6q08,1565976640.0,"I’m a Biology student and dissections are really good for a few things. 
1. Taxonomy: in a biology field, taxonomy is one of the first things stressed in school. You learn all the animal kingdom categories, plants, even fungus. Dissections solidify the anatomical differences and physical adaptations between different species with a visual tool. I.e. worms have alimentary canals rather than a digestive system involving multiple organs, crawfish have ganglia clusters rather than brains, fish have gills, etc.

2. Anatomy and physiology in general. Self explanatory. It’s a lot easier to identify something on a colored, highlighted diagram than it is on a real life specimen where all the inside organs are similar in color and jumbled together until you separate them.

3. Tools and procedures important for surgery/fieldwork dissections/research/etc
