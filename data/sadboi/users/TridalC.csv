How I got out was, I found a friend in school that I felt the most comfortable with. Just one. Then, he started introducing me to his friends. Then, they started introducing me to more friends. That's how I socialised.
I also met a lot of friends in the local gym,at random basketball courts etc. 
You can meet friends anywhere. Literally. 
Find someone that shares lots of interests as you, and start hanging out with them. They will modt likely introduce you to their friends. You will get a lot of experience socialising in the meanwhile, which will allow you to feel more comfortable talking to people and making new friends. 

Hope this helped! 
Also, I'm sorry for my english."
