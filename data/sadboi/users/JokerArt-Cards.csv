2: Depends on how well you build your deck. Most of the time, we play cards that help our strategy and just play through our opponent's plays, or we use generic cards to stop them, but it depends

3: There's not really a resource system. You can play as many spells as you want, you can use as many traps as you want (as long as they've been set for a turn), but you can only normal summon once per turn. The restrictions come from ""Once per turn's"", where you can only use the effect once. Also, some decks do use resources;  For example, the ""Endymion"" archetype uses ""spell counters"", which slowly build up. 

4: Depends. The newest decks tend to be better, but some decks from way back are still good. For example, something like ""Gren Maju"", which was released back in 2005, still sees play as a very strong deck. Some decks stand the test of time, some get hit by the ban list and get fucked for eternity...

5: Can't answer this one... Don't know much about it. Mostly for cheating though I believe.

6:  Dueling Book and YGOPRO are places you can pay online. As for good players, you would just have to climb the ranks till you find better players. 

BTW, don't know if you know, but unlike MTG, the game is really fast. Games tend to only last a few turns, due to FTK's (First Turn Kill; They don't get to play, because you beat them on the very first turn) and OTK's (On turn kill; As soon as it's your turn, your able to beat them)."
