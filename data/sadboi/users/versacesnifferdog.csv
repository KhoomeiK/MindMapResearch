But again, how they’d buy a lot of acid without being noticed over time, I’m not sure. 

If they did a mix of the above and then also had a very good burial place, then perhaps. Although at the rate another commentor worked out they’d have to kill at to get to around 600, it seems unlikely that this would even be possible, as it doesn’t allow for time spent with family/ time not working as a trucker etc or even in keeping with what we know about serial killer’s general waiting time in between kills.

vegan,fitz3z0,t1_fity99z,1582732360.0,"I’ve kind of adapted various recipes to my taste and made a few things up but I’ll try and explain it as best as I can: 

- lightly fry some chopped up garlic for 1/2 mins (until lightly browned) 

- use a potato masher to give the tofu that ‘scrambled’ texture (I like to use firm smoked tofu, I tried silken tofu once and it was okay but it takes a lot longer to cook to make it not sloppy!) 

- add one table spoon of nutritional yeast to the bowl containing the scrambled tofu

- add salt and pepper and paprika (as desired) and 

- add chopped up bell peppers and a tiny bit of olive oil to tofu mix and stir so everything is coated 

And then add to frying pan with garlic in and cook until it’s how you like it! (I think mine was 5-8 mins this morning) but I was stirring every 30 seconds or so, so no bits get burnt! 

I personally like quite a bit of paprika in mine, but that may not be to everyone’s taste. If you get rid of the paprika and add less garlic then overall it won’t be spicy! 

Hope this helps! Let me know how you get on :D I thought making tofu scrambled eggs took ages and was really fiddly but once I did it a few times and adapted the recipe to my taste, it’s such an easy go to meal for breakfast or lunch."
