Several voting sites are closed because of COVID-19 and the Supreme Court didn‚Äôt give any consistent reasoning as to why they wouldn‚Äôt allow more people to vote by mail. They‚Äôve forced people into putting their lives at risk by waiting in long lines with crowds of people, which is blatant voter suppression and criminal in any other situation. 

If a Pastor in Florida can be charged with public health endangerment for holding a church service, surely the government should be held accountable for putting people‚Äôs lives at risk like this."

Nobody makes it out alive in the end, and I want to embrace the extreme improbability of my own existence, regardless of how painful it is.
