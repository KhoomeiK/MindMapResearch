I saw a tour in Lapland, reviews said they’re really determined to search for polar lights (lol), it said they checked weather, locations, everything and pick diff spots every night! My friend went to Norway two years ago in mid April and had no luck too. So I’m hoping I could have some luck with this tour in Lapland. I heard that one of the tips is to stay longer in one place to wait for the sky to clear...

I would definitely miss speaking Cantonese in such a long trip lol

Sorry I couldn’t be your travel buddy but I’ve just come back from the faroes! 
I highly recommended you shouldn’t miss the very iconic “lake above the sea” hike. It’s a very easy 3 hours round trip hike!
Also, I stayed in a bnb in hoyvik instead of the downtown Torshavn, I think it was a good decision I made!
And if you’re looking for some day tours, I’d definitely recommend MM tours. (It’s more expensive compared to other tours but it worths the price!) 
I hope you have a fantastic time there! Which I did!"

I’ve never been able to stay in a job for long time, either I got too tired of the politics or people really don’t like me and I was told to leave. I am so lucky that every time I got back similar position with similar pay and so I barely survived all the years. I’d been feeling like a loser because why I couldn’t just do the job like anyone else around me? That everyone stays in their job for so long and get paid and even get promoted. Why is it so difficult for me? But I really don’t like what I do at my job, like as you said, it’s almost meaningless. Recently, I was once again told to leave my job because there will be restructure. I had to leave by end of Q1. When I first knew about the news, I was fucking panic and stressed out (because I have huge financial burden and it’s difficult for a middle age woman to get a similar job in a downward economy). I met some new friends who are not working in offices like I used to do, and they told me, maybe it’s just the fact that I don’t fit in those kind of office work. It doesn’t mean I’m stuck or it doesn’t mean I’m a loser. I finally accepted the fact that maybe it’s just mismatch that I shall not force myself to walk the road like most of the people. I started working for myself towards what I like to do, which is very diff from what I worked in office. And I’m lucky I got a lot of people’s help eg referring job to me etc. Anyway, long story short, it started to seem like to me that if you insist on your own road and you keep walking, you’ll find your own way. It’s lame but somehow you’ll be able to walk through it. It’s very insecure, imagine not having someone to put money in your bank account regularly, it’s hard but you’ll be happy. You’ll be proud of what you do and maybe that’s your way. I’m not sure if it’s my way, bc I just started. But hey, in case shit happens I can always go back and find a job. So why not try for a while? Why not go for it for once? I wish you all the best and you can do it!"

An evangelist was kneeling, pleading these cops not to use hand pistols with actual bullets, pointing them at journalists and reporters, when he was kicked away by this cop in the foreground.

This scene came after a number of protesters ambushed a police PTU van passing by, breaking the windows and fled. Out of four police inside the van, two abandoned their fellow officers and ran, while the remaining duo slowly came out after the protesters have dispersed but started waving their hand pistols around in panic.

The area was filled only with reporters at the time and were angry that this cop duo pointed an actual firearm at them, who then gave chased in pursuit of these two cops that started to flee. The reporters cornered the duo but backup was called in: nearly 100 riot police suddenly came out of nowhere and started threatening the reporters and refusing to answer the question of why the two officers pointed their hand pistols at journalists.

According to those at the scene and LegCo member Cheng Chung Tai, two shots were fired: one in the air and one that missed.
