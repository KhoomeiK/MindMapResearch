n64,fmou47x,t1_fmoqrrx,1586268505.0,"That was because the distributor for the first half of the N64's life in the UK and Europe - 'THE Games' - chose to present the artwork that way. This design was for all games made or published by Nintendo.

All other games published by third parties (Acclaim, Midway etc etc) just had the one black strip down the right side, which seemed to be the alternative template that everyone followed.

I believe in 2000 THE Games folded - or Nintendo simply took control of their own publications - which marked another change in Nintendo-made/published box designs.

Whichever way you look at it, Japanese box art wins pretty much every time! North American is generally better too. We got a crap deal over here.

Hope that explains it!
