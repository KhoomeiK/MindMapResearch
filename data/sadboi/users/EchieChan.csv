penpals,etj8w4q,t3_cburz0,1562868553.0,Would love to have a penpal and someone to read with. I'm trying to learn as many new things as I can and read more after a bit of a tough time so the motivation would be great :)
mentalhealth,esmp6js,t3_c8eve3,1562111052.0,"Good news everyone! This is wonderful, keep it up and get enjoying all those exciting things :)"
penpals,esmozwx,t3_c8ae5v,1562110914.0,"25/F/UK - I know you've had a lot of replies already so if you dont get to this I hope you find some lovely folks to talk to and befriend. Otherwise I'd love to write, I always wanted a pen pal when I was younger and I'm pretty lonely right now after years of depression, anxiety and rough times so I'd love to make a new friend.
Also, your trinket ideas are fab, I love little charity shop nik naks and I have a polaroid too I've been dying to use more. Shout if you want to talk :)"
tifu,ernbyxr,t1_ermjqus,1561049271.0,Hair is so the best when you're high! My boyfriend has loose afro hair and I just sit and play with it and get him to stroke my hair because it's so nice and gentle and is the best damn feeling in this world when you are off your tits just smiling away feeling up someone's 'fro.

The condition is NEAD (Non-epileptic attack disorder). Many people never experience how nasty the long term effects can be and the typical, just talk to someone isn't helpful when you're intermittently unconscious."
mentalhealth,eqp5at6,t1_eqp3ro0,1560196035.0,"You're very welcome, sorry you're going through such a tough time but great to hear you know what you want and you want to keep fighting. It's so hard to find something you like work wise but in the meantime just find something tolerable, give yourself time to heal mentally, maybe save up if you can handle working more then when you're ready to move on you could even have a couple of months off for yourself. I'm sure you'll get there :)"
mentalhealth,eqoq2gv,t3_byz4wk,1560191363.0,"I left a job I hated for what it was doing to my mental health last year and have lost 2 since because of it. All were customer service based in call centres which I didn't mind and was good at for a time.
I think what has the biggest impact is being in an environment where you have to interact with people constantly, it's so draining. Not only are you customer facing in your job but working in a close team you almost have no time to deal with your own feelings because you have to be constantly switched on to talk to other people. Mayne look into a new job doing something quiet, warehouse work or something manual where you can be left alone to get on with your work. Or even night shifts could suit you better as there's less people to deal with and they may prefer a similar quiet environment given the late shifts.
Hope everything works out for you, try your best and don't make any decision that could cause more trouble with bills and such but put your health first. If you aren't happy so soon after starting it may be the job is the problem. Best of luck!"
