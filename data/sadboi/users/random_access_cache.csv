If you want you can upgrade later and use this time to learn the software's basic workflow without being overwhelmed by content, which could be a pretty good idea, but if you want everything right away I don't think you can really go wrong with suite, it's objectively a much richer version.

On the other hand it does glue you to a certain scale with no way out, which narrows possibilities greatly, I personally like to experiment melodically so I don't really use Scale unless I need to randomize or arpeggiate notes, but it's undoubtedly a very simple, strong tool that can save a lot of time and frustration."

Thank you for getting in touch with Ableton Support and sorry for the long reply time.

Due to the current situation, we are unfortunately working at the limits of our capacities at the moment. Therefore unusually long response times may occur.
We apologize for this and any further delay.

After reading your log file, I noticed that you are using DirectX drivers.

DirectX drivers are not recommended for working with Live, as they cause very high latency and can lead to a lot of strange behavior and errors.

In any case, please use the Asio drivers from the manufacturer of your audio device.

If you are having problems or if you are using an internal sound card that does not have native Asio support, please download and use Asio4All.

Asio4All is a generic driver that works with almost all available audio devices.

To use it in Live, please open Live's Preferences-->Audio and select ASIO as the driver type and the appropriate driver as the audio device.

Please also pay attention to the buffer size, as this directly affects performance, crackle, dropouts, and latency!

I recommend reading the following articles on this topic:
--> ASIO is the recommended audio driver on Windows

--> Setting up ASIO4ALL (Windows)

Further please try to reset the graphic settings to default in the Nvidia system settings.

Should you've connected a G-Sync compatible gaming display set the display refresh rate to 60Hz and see if the issue persists.

Please keep me posted and feel free to come back at any time."

I feel like Blade Runner is sort of relevant here, or the novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? It addresses similar questions.

It's his painting, his brush strokes, his fingerprints on that painting. I understand what you are saying but I feel this sort of logic is a bit flawed because if you choose to use it you have to be consistent, I'm guessing my point is that the more we strip the human element out of a creation, the less it is relatable.

So do you just do the tapping thing? For how long? Like, for one minute before you go to sleep? 

Thing is I don't know how bad it really is, if at all. I noticed it suddenly after going to a loud concert (and wearing earplugs for the better half of it!), and since then it felt like it subsided but these past few days it suddenly feels like it got worse. And it's hard to actually tell. This anxiety feedback loop man. I am an anxious person with prescription meds and this sort of stuff throws me off balance. And I'm a musician so I am now ultra conscious about volume when listening to music and making music and stuff like that, but it's kind of surprising to me that I don't really notice people around me with the same interests reporting stuff like that. I don't know man. This sucks"
