There had been female winners, there had been winners of color, there had been unathletic winners, there had been Mom winners. But before Sandra's second win those were all kinda flukey. Tina was the nice mom who got brought to the end by a guy who wanted to look good on TV, Vecepia was fucking invisible, Jenna had an immunity hot streak at the very end, Amber was hated less than her boyfriend who did almost all of the work the whole game, Danni was a jock, Parvati was a flirt and Natalie was in the Amber boat. That's not what *I* think of these players, that's just what they appeared to be to many people.

Sandra winning twice forever broke the glass ceiling (until Probst rebuilt it with nigh-indestructable super glass), because *on paper* she was possibly the *worst* of all the women I listed. She wasn't some expert spear fisherman. She wasn't an alpha male challenge beast. She was a short, stubby, completely unathletic Puerto Rican Mom who worked in an office and liked to call people ""motherfucker."" And yet for ten years she was the *only* person to win the game twice. She epitomized success in a game that, at first glance, she would surely be dismal at.

So to me Sandra perfectly represents the subversive nature of Survivor, that the weak will kill the strong, that the least likely will kill the most likely, and that greatness can come in any package. She's the perfect representative of the game."

In All-Stars he is one of the main reasons I fucking hate it, being a smug asshole isn't entertaining when you're playing with people I like.

In Heroes vs Villains he's basically peak Rob for me, being reconstructing himself as a hero and being a central figure in a great pre-merge (I really wish that season had merged at 12).

survivor,fr0bqwz,t3_gltza4,1589790066.0,"Lex and Rob were two of the closest friends in the alumni.

Lex and Rob, along with Kathy and Tom, had a pre-game alliance going into All-Stars. They would be the Final Four and sort it out there (which is exactly what Lex, Tom and Ethan did in Africa).

It was the first pre-game alliance in reality competition history, as All-Stars was the first time a reality competition would be held between what was essentially a group of friends.

There was an unspoken agreement among the cast to target all of the winners and not include them in plans.

Lex voted out Ethan because he was a threat and as a winner he just had to go, but they never had an alliance.

When Amber was (effectively) swapped onto Mogo Mogo, Rob told Lex ""You take care of her, I'll take care of you. If you can.""

Lex, being both an ally of Rob and a friend of Rob, saved Amber.

Rob responded by breaking their pre-game agreement and betraying Lex.

It is an incredibly complicated situation because emotion and friendship got entangled with the game.

Yes, Rob made the move he had to make. Yes, Lex was justified in feeling so upset about it. Yes, it is dripping with irony that paints Lex as a hypocrite, most powerfully in Rob pulling Lex's signature move in telling Lex ahead of time.

All of these things are true, that's just the nature of All-Stars.

The fact is, Rob leveraged his friendship with Lex to get Lex to tank his own game. Rob brought something from outside of the game into the game and used it as a weapon. In an era where almost every single alliance was formed between friends, to the point where friendship *defined* alliances, it was an incredibly vicious move.

It's hard enough to play objectively when you're playing with your friends. It's worse when you actually use your personal life to get ahead in the game.

What really makes Rob a villain is not what he does to Lex, but that he lies about it.

First he acts like he lying to Lex when he made that promise and he was a sucker for believing him, which really runs counter to what we see.

Then he lies to Lex's face by telling him his promise came with a ""if I can caveat,"" which is NOT true. Rob said ""if *YOU* can,"" not ""if **I** can.""

Lex might be a hypocrite for accusing Rob of selling out his friendships for a stack of greenbacks, but Rob is the guy who cut a deal with his friend, broke his deal, then pretended there never was a deal. That's what makes him a villain. And then afterwards he brags to his brother about what a dumbass Lex is, which just digs him deeper.

And none of the talk about pre-game alliances was even hinted at in the show, which just makes everyone look even worse.

The Final 10 swap/late merge in All-Stars is one of the single worst twists the show has ever done."

My thoughts have changed and now I think Fabio winning is the funniest thing that happened, for basically the same reason (Fabio winning just underlines how much Survivor *isn't* the purely strategic game so many people think it is). 

But I think it's even funnier that the second two-time winner, the undisputed King of Survivor and possibly the #1 contender for greatest player of all time is the guy who, the second he hit the beach, ran off into the jungle screaming in llama and tried to bury himself alive by the water well.

I'll never understand why people say this.

Nobody who is asking for Majin Vegeta to be in the game wants him to just be a reskinned Super Saiyan Vegeta. Obviously we want him to be a character *at least* as distinct as Base Vegeta, who was a great addition to the game.

The implication is that people only want Majin Vegeta for aesthetics, which is ridiculous.

It is 100% within ASW's power to make the character that unique. The only question is if they would be willing to do it, or if they would take the lazy route and just clone Super Saiyan Vegeta, which would be a massive disappointment for everybody.

Majin Vegeta's fight with Goku is one of the best choreographed and animated fights in the series. It is one of the best action showcases Vegeta ever got. And yet, in all of Vegeta's animations in the games, only a select few poses are culled from the Boo arc with the vast majority being drawn from the Vegeta, Freeza and Cell arcs.

In the fight between Vegeta and Goku, Vegeta uses lots of knees and elbows and lots of grabs. There is a lot of animations and moves that could be mined from that fight, way beyond the stock beam spam/Big Bang/Final Flash. If they wanted to they could make him a damn grappler.

The point is it all comes down to how much work they want to put into it. Me and everyone else who wants Majin Vegeta don't want a hackjob. *Nobody* wants that."

survivor,fqrvzsr,t1_fqrusno,1589593072.0,I think you're being facetious to make a political point.
survivor,fqrvmlw,t1_fqrusbm,1589592852.0,"It's more the principle.

In Cook Islands there were three pre-merge jurors, two of whom played with Yul and none of whom that had ever played with Ozzy. They ended up voting 2-1 in favor of Ozzy, but in a game that was decided by one vote there was one juror who Ozzy had never played with who voted for Yul.

In Fiji it was a unanimous vote so it didn't matter, but in Gabon the one pre-merge juror was the one juror who had played with Bob the entire time, and he voted for Bob in what ultimately became a 4-3 vote.

Were Ozzy and Susie robbed by the pre-merge jury? I don't think so. But why even go there?"

survivor,fqrplrj,t1_fqrn2ic,1589589212.0,"Well I have Brenda, Corinne and the 10 Fans counted in this because Tony beat Sophie who beat Cochran who beat those people, but Sophie did not beat the Cochran who had won Caramoan. So there are many ways of looking at it.

Under the Harry Potter rules Tony beat Richard, Tina, Ethan, Jenna, Sandra, Amber, Tom, Danni, Aras, Yul, Parvati, JT, Rob, Sophie, Kim, Denise, Tyson, Natalie, Jeremy, Michele, Adam, Sarah, Ben, Wendell, Nick and all of the players of all the seasons they won, plus the cast of Cagayan. It just gets more complicated when you factor in returning plays and try to actually sort this by proximity. I got my math wrong three times before I opened a spreadsheet and punched in all of the numbers season by season."
