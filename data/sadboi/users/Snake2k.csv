That's the beauty of it imo. Looks like everyone is spazzing out, but it all makes sense.

Where people are on the extrovert - introvert scale is kind of out of their control, all people can do is kinda tweak it every now and then to adapt. I guess the point is, if the world wasn't shut down, you could still WFH and have regular social gatherings. Who knows? Some groups in companies might even have ""work together groups"" where extroverted employees could hang out and work together. It's different for everyone I suppose.  

It has brought up a good question though. What should be the default? Asking people to work in an office? Or giving them the opportunity to work together if they'd like?  

The way I see it, the latter is a better default because it helps more people. People dealing with social anxiety or depression are less likely to say anything. Isn't it better if they're given an option to socialize instead of forcing them into cubicles? :)"
