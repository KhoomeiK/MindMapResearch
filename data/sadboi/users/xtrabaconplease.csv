My partner and I have never been monogamous, we’ve been swingers since the beginning. I’ve always believed I was poly. But my partner never wanted to take me up on that, till he decided to cheat.

This is all new behavior for her. When I said yes, she wasnt behaving like this.

Anyone who disregards another persons boundary doesn't care about you."
