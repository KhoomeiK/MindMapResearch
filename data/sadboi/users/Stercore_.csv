it’s not my fault you refuse to understand that the term racism has more nuance and meaning to it than the only one you apply to in. look it up. wikipedia even has a whole section detailing how badly ‘race’ is defined in relation to racism and how it has several meanings. the most prominent one, especially in america, is the division into black, white and asian. but since race is such an arbitary term there’s nothing to say that anyone can’t put other divisions between, for example, germans and jews.

arabs have had a significant impact on hormuz and iran as a whole but that doesn’t make them arab. something having been part of whatever doesn’t mean they still are that. should all of india, canada, south africa and australia just merge with the UK? no, that would be dumb. so adding Qeshm to this map still doesn’t make sense, as it isn’t at all arab anymore, it was never even part of the british empire. 

i’m not saying the answer is no, i’m saying the answer is yes, but the influence of arabs on the island is not close to significant enough for it to be annexed by an arab state. and saying ""tbf didn’t the island used to be owned by arabs earlier?"" isn’t fair at all. because the island, while arab once, isn’t arab anymore.

this isn’t a modern society with strict and rigid keeping of information. it’s basically a medieval european continent. what little knowledge of the past exists only exist in the hands of a far flung few. and that info will be exetremely limited considering the decimation that the world was passed theough during the Breaking. it’s like a wiping of the slate"

there are speculations in the fanbase on wether alternate realities are real in WoT but that is simply speculation, what we know for sure is that time repeats itself. everything that has happened will happen, and everything that will has already happened. thousands of times. Rand, the Heros of the Horn and everyone else in WoT have lived thousands of lives and will live thousands more as the wheel turns, Rand just isn’t aware of this and of who he was in previous lives, the spirits do know who he was in his previous life however."
