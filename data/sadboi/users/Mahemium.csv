But that final 2% is a difficulty cliff, and if that custom way of playing was off meta, you're in for a rude awakening that the particular way you'd just spent possibly hundreds of hours mastering and gearing for, just won't work, period.

I had a Templar tank, magicka based. Jabs were my friend. My ice staffs were my friend. Why block with a shield  when I could gear towards healing sets, where I self heal through absolutely any damage? Why puncture when I could drop elemental drain and pull with my heavy attack?
