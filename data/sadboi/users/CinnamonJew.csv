And yes the test results will change depending on mood, as would any personality test would. Because in a way, mood alters your personality temporarily. Therefore in the short term, the test is not reliable (although it may still be accurate (that is another separate debate on closed questionnaires and peoples accuracy to self report)), but if you take the test regurarly, it may highlight your most dominant personality type or even your personality in specific situations.

People aren't just one set personality type in my eyes. The contexts of the situation (such as mood, social pressures etc.) affects in that moment the dominant personality type that is present.

Even when it does work its a long and hard path. But learning that even if you have people giving you support, if you dont believe it yourself you wont take that support seriously, and you'll still feel lonely.

Details on the undiagnosed bit: i get identifying with an illness (im not even sure i can call a lot of personality disorders illnesses in my perspective) is often a bad idea, which is why ive avoided a diagnosis altogether, but ive still identified in a way.

What isnt is artificially created labour that is required for you to survive, designed out of luxury for others rather than necessity. If you dont do this labour not only do you not eat, your ability to function properly in society is removed (emphasis on removed.) It is a constant threat of an unlivable quality of life created by people, and that is slavery. Its the exact same core rule that was present in slavery, its just now modern slaves aren't allowed to be directly physically harmed, to make the whole thing look more acceptable. The majority of people cant just ""not work"", they dont have a choice. If they wanted that choice, they have to work, regardless if that work actually had any real world or individual benefit. That isnt free willed labour. And labour without free will is slavery.

Because goverments exist to sustain themselves, much like most other concepts or organisms, its about selfish survival.

America is just at the forefront of this, at least its honest about what it is and what it prioritises. Hell, look at UK, not closing schools cause it cuts into their GDP even though schools will always be a massive vector in viral transmissions. Its been argued that its because children will be fine, and that NHS workers cant support children at home and work life. But keeping schools open will just put more pressure in a shorter period of time on the NHS, which they should be avoiding since the NHS can barely cope with a resuturants worth of minor A&E patients. At least with children you can organise them to live somewhere else for a period of time, like with family or neighbours. You cant reorganise life-saving/life-comforting treatment.

AntifascistsofReddit,fipz3c0,t1_fintavm,1582628792.0,"Ah i shouldve made the distinction clearer. If a person has fascist views but doesn't negatively impact anyone else's lives its ok, world of free thinking, we are not the thought police (some people may disagree and say any fascist or fascist-accomodating thinking should be punished // which i feel is how you see the whole of antifa, and something i feel goes too far and starts to resemble authoritarianism.) its when people proactively or passively let that thinking affect peoples lives.

And again, most (emphasis on most) of antifa wouldnt say you're a fascist unless you act like one. Pretty sure most of the people can distinguish between clearly different ideologies like anyone else can. So to make such a generalised statement is not accurate, regardless of your personal experience which will only make up a small portion of the members at most.

From what i know of Andy Ngo, and i may be wrong so correct me if you see so, he didnt just turn a blind eye. He contributed big time with his hitlist and encouragement to assault and dehumanize left wing people. Wouldn't say he deserved to die, but he understandably had it coming, especially since one of those assaults can easily turn into manslaughter or murder.

Edit: I'm proof enough of this. I consider myself a part of antifa, yet i have a few close conservative and right wing friends. I do not care what they do with their lives or how they think, unless they start negatively impacting the lives of many people. I havent called or implied you as a fascist or nazi.

Take a look at feminism rn, its pretty much a worldwide meme of a select few who were way too vocal and dillusional, thats now just a generalisation for the whole group.

As a whole, Antifa doesnt go around calling everyone fascists. However you dont need to be a fascist or literal nazi to accomadate them, and you dont need to want a goverment to be one (big meme anarcho-fascism here.) Not saying you do or are in any form, i dont know you well enough to say that. But overall, if we see a person turning a blind eye to fascism, in our eyes are they any different?? They may not be proactive about it, or even share the same beliefs, but they let it happen. Hence why its such a big joke about Antifa calling everyone fascists, cause Antifa also calls out those who accomodate it aswell."

If fascists as a whole didnt directly ruin peoples lives so effectively, a lot of us wouldnt give a shit, let alone assault them. But we have to, because everyone being pacifists means we'll get exploited easily.

Edit: dont get me wrong, pacifism has a place, but its contextual and isnt applicable to every situation.

Yes sure, you get to choose who you vote in, but that's based on how well they can convince you rather than definite facts. As such many politicians resort to lying and charisma to win over the masses rather than actual competence.  And as such, it's why a lot of politicians will say one thing and then do the opposite as soon as they have their position of power. Democracy can be easily abused, and if there's a monopoly on media like currently, it's nigh impossible to get a majority vote.

Preferably I think anarchism has to come from well intentioned education first, but I do also see violence as a necessary part of anarchisms evolution.

On the side of violence, it is a good tool for expression. However I also agree some take it too far. Imo, violence should be against buildings (with the people evacuated), cargo trains and capitalist supply systems rather than people or commuters transportation. This way it pressures the capitalist system while reducing the effect on the ordinary person who's just caught in the crossfire, so they can carry on living as best they can. 

We do care about people, that's a large reason why most of us are anarchist in the first place. Because we see the suffering of others due to these systems, or have experienced it ourselves. However, some put that a priority above the people themselves unfortunately. But in any case, we can't completely avoid affecting the people, and sometimes some actions are necessary but hurt the ordinary person.

He could've literally just been a passive bystander in the wrong area at the wrong time, being accused of a crime he didn't commit or just by association. Or he could've just been victim to an intentionally ambiguous law that is made specifically to make criminals out of innocent people."
Vermintide,f1f32ix,t3_d96yeh,1569436045.0,"I really enjoy its horde clearing potential, bolstered by its high ammo cap, in chokepoints and its mobility while being able to target (and takedown) elites like stormvermin even without precise accuracy. The glaive makes up for the swiftbows inability to takedown chaos warriors nicely.

Only downside is if team mates are targeting the same part of the horde as me, i cant use the swiftbow due to the high risk of FF. Although again, the glaive can then takeover the role nicely as a support weapon.

Basically, i feels its underated for its lack of raw power in a single shot, as most use melee to clear hordes."
