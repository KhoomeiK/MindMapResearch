My tenant hates me because I can't give her a discount for a broken washer because I need the money to hire help to move it up narrow stairs because I can't do it myself.

I have binged shows before and there are quite a lot and the media companies don't care if you waste your life doing it, actually they encourage it.  Reading articles online is a thing or going to weekly therapy.  I could garden this summer by myself.  I know my tenants can see that hobby, but they aren't social enough for me.

Maybe I could get back into writing, though everyone is an artist.  I could start a YouTube channel, but there is hella a lot of competition.  I know a new pizza place is coming to this town.  

Politics is a thing, but nothing ever really changes in that game in a rural community.  I guess work on job skills, so I can go somewhere myself.  Never really been good at dating, but I am a good neighbor.  Not the best landlord because tenant wants everything for free and done immediately.  Glad I am not her anymore.

I guess exercise and cooking.  I tried the harmonica, but lost interest and the actual thing already.

Glad I am not a violent person, and I like sitting in the sun.  Maybe I will get a dog, so strangers have something to talk to me about.  If not, I will just save money and hope my nephew has a better life than me.  I endure."

No one is watching and that is scary.  The only one I have to compete against is me yesterday or last year or several years ago when I tried dead weight lifting.  I just tend to spend too much in my mine alone ruminating, and somehow I just have to live with it.  Eating better helps and not looking down at phone as long.

It is not about me, but ironically, it is.  This Catch 22 perplexes me.  I have ""wasted"" a lot of my life trying to reconcile this.  Also, alcoholism is a thing, but why is it at every adult function?  AA is too, but how can the government require it?  We have a system that gives substances to socialize, but makes it illegal to abuse it.  Shame and guilt just make it a bad cycle.  

Prohibition doesn't work but also treatment if no jobs or potential healthy friends when now we have high strength nicotine and cannabis to deal with.  But, these substances bond people.  How about video games and pornography?

This may be the wrong forum, but I think these issues have a lot to do with social skills.  The crisis will show how people cope to survive with substance abuse and suicide because they are alone and those who don't struggle still use but have fancy cars and houses to go back to.  Real problems like poverty and loneliness are here to stay.  Practice being your intentions.  They may led to hell, but we need solidarity with actual people in realtime/realspace.

Still feel it, the night I was put on emergency detention in September for alcohol let the demon out.  I am not a criminal, but owe back taxes.  My heart and shoulders hold the stress.  Why am I so lonely in this isolation?  I can't hug money or talk to it, I mean listen to it...

Guess I should take care of my heart on way to heart disease.  Thick blood scheduled to be drawn in a month.  I am ok and not, mixed emotions.  I have to remain positive for possibilities for a better future where I am loved by a stranger and productive.  I endure."
rant,fojcr03,t3_g7mrqq,1587816952.0,"This is just a rant nothing more.  It helps release pressure.  They are just words.  I do have some economics training, but these are not the most wild ideas.

If anything, I bet we have deflation, but you can't eat paper.

I have a heart condition, and just want to survive til I can smile and give my family a hug."
gratitude,foi2stj,t3_g6ovys,1587777554.0,"Thanks for the 8 upvotes.  I see other threads with lots of feedback, but not this one.  Knowing 7 or 8 read it makes me feel special in a very small way."
MindSet,foi2djq,t3_g7i5ft,1587777308.0,"First, you are human, there is no perfect.  Take things casually and work on self assertiveness skills, videos on YouTube.  Lots suffer from this, just read subreddit on anxiety or social skills.

We are all playing improv, just sine have more practice.  This is the advice I try to give myself daily."
Shamanism,fohwkq8,t3_g7aut7,1587774038.0,"I have been out of work for 8 yrs and learned I too have a/d.  I also have high blood pressure and the med I take helps me stay around and reduces neck pain.  Lots suffer, but if you are breathing and sleep in a bed and not car/streets, it is good, at least from my perspective."
Advice,fohumwn,t3_g7dzvo,1587772965.0,"A berevament group with hospice helped me with the loss of my dad 7 years ago suddenly to the flu.  You are never alone.  Maybe go online there may be one online this time.  Remember, my opinion, there is no wrong way to grieve, it takes time to feel the feelings.  Great for you reaching out."
gratitude,foh7ig0,t3_g78qq2,1587761397.0,"Stood up for the meeting on zoom.  I can't even focus enough to be a new computer.  I know my life ain't so bad, but the isolation is killing me slowly like 6 cigarettes a day.  Have encouragement on phone from multiple people, but feel judged by my female tenant if I pace or cry in my backyard.

Niceness and kindness doesn't pay the bills.  Guess I look for a new therapist and honor 12 Step Meetings, Smart Recovery, and Lifering.  I wish I could make some sort of new relationships, but got on meds right before pandemic and all I get is encouraging listening from family that worries about me.  The nurse says increase the meds, at least I am not homeless or waiting for an answer.  

I am not a loser for not having a partner, a job, or someone in this small rural town who seeks out my company.  If the circumstances were different, I could go back to donating my time at the Soup Kitchen, but they never offered me any new opportunities only harder work along side people with real drug problems doing community service.  Oh well, in the future, they will need sober people to do what I don't know.  Keep going, be safe, wait around another day in solitary.  The sun is shining and a few sweet peas are breaking the soil.  I am ok. I am."
Meditation,foh0u5n,t3_g765zr,1587759235.0,"I take meds for mine but all they do is make me lazy.  Nurse increased the dosage, it is due to unemployment and loneliness.  I wish I liked video games.  Youtube also added to it by giving me attention deficit.  Weed treats the panic attacks, but it is illegal where I live.  So thankful to some income though don't know what to do with this free time that will make bether skilled after the pandemic.  Have an old degree in econ, but no job opportunities in this rural college town.  I should have studied something more practical like engineering or college administration.  oh well, not going backwards in time."

careerguidance,foaw3k0,t1_fo9d0kg,1587653303.0,No he was business operations guy.  Focused attention and real results are a gift when lots of humans are all fragmented and distracted with some small bits of information.  Quotes and resumes arent the same as hard work and sustainable results.
socialskills,fo8ze3v,t3_g67c1g,1587607094.0,"Yes.  Easily frustrated, can't find my tribe, low self esteem, now laptop has issues, like me.  Letters add extra characters.  I have mixed emotions about internet, time suckage.  Never been good at video games.  Right now all I got are a small pile of money and fingers to write this message."
zoloft,fo8dpu4,t1_fo8avmm,1587594599.0,"Zoloft just makes me feel lazy like I was before them.  I asked for Welliburton going in and they put me on this. 3 months and still no friends or job prospects.  At least I am not on Seroquel and Ativan like my friend was.  I am not depressed because the weather and sun are better, but the nurse says increase the dosage.

They don't know the economy of being poor and how hard has been for me to create relatons hips when unemployed in an alcohol soaked college town.  I dont relate to the young white people.  

Unnecessary risks, what I don't hurt myself but got income this month.  This is bs.  My blood pressure went up for dealing with stressor, it is understandable."
zoloft,fo8cusk,t3_g683zz,1587594138.0,"All I feel good for is consuming higher and higher dosages, at 150 mg now.  Supposed to be on 200 mg.  I will always have life issues.  The meds don't solve them.  I am just lonely and the med doesn't help with that.  Active listening and risk taking does, but all the places are closed and I have a round Filipino face."
