Then, it is a holistic picture of the situation. Once that picture is drawn, maybe you can find a way out through either using a problem solving worksheet (if your thoughts are true, and you can take action) or using radical acceptance (if it is in your perception, or there is no action you can take)."

He sees self reflection as a weakness and thinks people need to just move on. He looks down on psychology intensely. You mentioned preferring to focus on the here and now - is not analyzing the past part of the condition? If so - I think I should just let that go and accept what I can get from him.

My story is so similar except different. I have a NSister and NMom who I am no contact with. My NSister, when I was 12 and she was 19, cut my hair to be a short, boy cut. I had straight, blonde hair which she was envious of because she had curly blonde hair (which she hated but everyone else thought was gorgeous). I was mocked for ‚Äúlooking like a boy‚Äù and something was taken from me with that act. 

Narcissistic people are obsessed with hair. Maybe there is a link to outward appearances? My sister was considered a beauty- but I was coming into myself. But with the abuse with this being a small example my confidence suffered to this day.

As a message, I get that he wants you to be creative and bold, and to ""go for it"" (I don't necessarily know what ""it"" is but I hope you do). There is also something where he wants you to move forward with your life, like a ""just do it"" approach to things rather than dwelling.

I am in no contact with them now (except for my brother who I am in very low contact with.)

I would focus on your own healing, and make sure your sister's memory is alive to those who care about her. Maybe like a photo album, a memorial website or something like that? Likely her decision was a complex one and the living don't have all the answers. I am not a media expert, but my husband worked in it for 20 years, and he says that as soon as a camera is on, things get distorted. Not sure if healing happens there.

He is concerned that you are at war with yourself somewhat, and wants you to reach out to him, spiritually, and trust your inner self. I am picturing you lying in bed and thinking of a problem - then the answer ""pops"" into your head. He also says you are having a hard time accepting a situation for what it is.

But, being so deep, and not being able to express it, was a big burden for him, and he had to drop it. I got a heavy energy. 

&#x200B;

I feel that he cared for you, and still does. He feels better. There are outdated beliefs around suicide in the spiritual community, but he does have peace. His message is to be careful of something that seems too perfect. And, there is a man who you need to be careful around. A smart man, who knows a lot of things, but who is also not going to help you - maybe a professional such as an engineer. It is like a dark version of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man character.

The hard thing for me is that my brother and sister stand next to her like iron sentries even when they know about the sexual and other abuse I suffered (they are much older so did not experience it). She also trash talked me to my grandparents which damaged my relationship with my grandmother (but not my grandpa who knew the score). 

What everyone else is saying is correct - you can‚Äôt change her or get validation from her. She is how she is and will not change. Is there someone else who can validate you? In his old age, my grandpa visited us in the summers, and since he was vulnerable and older, my mom targeted him. He and I then called her acting out times as ‚ÄúFriday nights‚Äù. We wrote about this in letters, not emotionally but as fact that she had a ‚ÄúFriday night‚Äù.  My grandpa was a WW2 Royal Navy vet and tough but real. 

That bit of validation from him, from my husband who she later targeted before I went no contact,  helped me. She also started to go after my 5-yr-old son - the ultimate innocent. I can see that. My husband can see that. My best friend can see that. My siblings can‚Äôt. Our society seems to encourage getting through it alone, but there are a lot of people coming out about recovering within relationships. Having a fellow witness helps so much. 

My brother is a dr. And my sister is a psychologist - so they pretend to be authoritative. But me and my fellow witnesses have seen the truth."
