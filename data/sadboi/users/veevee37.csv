KindVoice,fqr7vxa,t3_gkhg6c,1589579242.0,"Hello. I’m so sorry for all of the losses you’ve experienced. I don’t know what you’re going through, all I can say is that I’ve experienced losing a loved one from my immediate family, and if there’s anything I’ve realized from what I went through, that it’s all a process (that’s different for everyone)

You’ll continue to hurt, that’s understandable. If anything, maybe finding little things you enjoy can help slightly during these times. Picking up a hobby, going out with friends if you end up feeling it can be nice to talk to someone about anything, or just going out alone to spend time by yourself. 
You are never alone. These must be tough times, but your strength can really help guide you right now. You don’t have to be happy right now or months, or even a year from now. Emotions come naturally, take care of yourself as much as you feel you can."
KindVoice,fqr5kq5,t3_gk7v7q,1589578010.0,"You can get through this! All emotions pass, you don’t have to be happy all the time. Once you feel a bit better, you’ll hopefully think more positive as well on all these things you’re talking about! You’re gonna be okay! Optimism and being realistic both are key!"
KindVoice,fqr4zfg,t3_gkekiw,1589577691.0,"I think that often times good relationships are likely to come along when you’ve worked on yourself for your own sake! Learning to love yourself and do things for you that are in your best interest will likely help you create better friendships, relationships, etc. as you’ll be in the right mindset to have these great things. I think everything starts with ourselves. How we treat ourselves affects really everything xx You are worth so much no matter what by the way! No one can take away that worth."
depression,ffo3cly,t3_eu7fur,1580073658.0,"So proud of you. You can do this, you’re strong. Continue staying strong, you deserve that"
lonely,f62o3zr,t3_dq2sjk,1572663724.0,there’s always possibilities for it. there’s been a lot of moments where i wonder if i’m good enough for those sorts of things but i figure there’s always ways to find connections with different people. I figure that good people take time to come around sometimes
SuicideWatch,f5dzkho,t3_dl1tfq,1572162284.0,"you deserve the best. i may not understand what you’re going through, but i’m terribly sorry for it all. you deserve to live past 30. the world can be an awful place. i’m not good at advice, so i won’t try to give it, but i’m always here if you need anyone to listen. you seem like a wonderful person"

toptalent,f4d0imc,t3_dk7oic,1571536395.0,it looks so beautiful!
FriendshipAdvice,f2z8zh0,t1_f2z760k,1570510541.0,definitely very true. it’s better to be honest with ourselves when it comes to people’s intentions than to ignore everything

lonely,f2dz0i4,t3_dcr4qu,1570171320.0,"i used to be that way, but now it’s changed into always feeling lonely and always looking forward to when i have people to talk to"
offmychest,f285nkp,t1_f0ob3sl,1570053281.0,"you have always been good enough. self improvement should never end, because you should always do it for yourself. you’ve got to love yourself too! you’re worth so much. who cares about what others think of you, who cares what anyone has to say. they don’t know what you feel or why you do what you do. loving yourself and trying your best everyday is all that you can do at times. it’s not weak to cry or feel pain, if people say that it is then that says more about them than you."
lonely,f284s77,t1_f28453p,1570052708.0,i love that!

lonely,f25v0ib,t3_dbllwl,1569984542.0,"all we can do is try to be the best that we can be. continue to grow, stay positive, focus on yourself. we’re all flawed, that’s okay. we will always lose people, but we can learn and try more so that we’re better for the next people we meet"
lonely,f25u7dr,t3_dc3lps,1569983935.0,"i’m sure it’s happened! i’m 100% sure of it. often times people won’t say anything, but that doesn’t mean no one has ever had a crush on you"
lonely,f25t0p6,t3_dbzkdz,1569983047.0,"you’re not boring at all! you’re a complex human being with your very own likes, dislikes, hopes, quirks, and so much more. there will never be another you to ever exist, and thats pretty interesting to me. life is all about perspective. if we look at things negatively, then the world only seems a bit more gloomy"
lonely,f25s79r,t3_dc1owa,1569982435.0,"everything will be okay! it seems like you even starve yourself from your own affection, which might be making you feel even lonelier. spend time doing the things you love and staying positive. positivity really does do wonders. you’re worth a ton, and no one can ever take away your worth from you (not even yourself) nothing is ever as impossible as it seems. stay strong!"
lonely,f25rthv,t3_dbsl7s,1569982146.0,love can happen at the most unexpected times. your future partner is out there somewhere! never lose hope and look forward to the future. nothing is ever impossible!
lonely,f25rmog,t3_dc0tt1,1569982005.0,"there is always somebody for everyone. i heard this somewhere: you may not be your type, but you’re someone’s type. you don’t have to look a certain way or act a certain way to be good enough. you will always have worth and no one can ever take that away from you. always work at being the best you, always improve yourself and the right people will come along. life is so much more than love from others. i realized a while ago that when we think so much of our loneliness, life only seems to go a bit slower. get a haircut, change your style, pick up a new hobby. do all of it for you, because focusing on yourself will always be able to make you happier than anyone else could make you feel."
