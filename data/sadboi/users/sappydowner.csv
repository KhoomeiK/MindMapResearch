First, the characters and the general environment: I have to say that I love the first game more, I really like Chicagi, the windy city and its rainy, noir, dark feel - the general atmosphere was more set up like a dystopian world, which I love sooo much - this said, in the sequel it all felt a little over the top (?) with everyone just being  an hipster and also San Francisco, even if it is a beautiful city objectively, it's just not my type of city, also the colors are too bright. 
That's (sorry for the big mess up in my phrasing but I'm not really good at this) why I basically did not like the second game BUT in the last days, I'm I'm growing to like it, well no, more like ""accepting it"" > the idea better explained is that this is simply the new generation of hackers and DedSec, Aiden and the characters of the first game are more Old School, they're more like the old guard. It's the new substituting the old. Almost. 

(Still hoping all this makes sense, I repeat: sorry for my english) 

Legion will be a great game, I really look forward to it and am really curious: it looks like they're bringing back that dystopian, dark feel and mixing it with funny things to ""lighten it"" (does this expression even exist?)

If you would not mind, I could propose my self as co-writer or kind of, I'd love to do something like this with other people with passion for the series

lifelinegame,fprndy1,t1_fpq3yqt,1588858199.0,"I have an idea to fix the issue with this.
