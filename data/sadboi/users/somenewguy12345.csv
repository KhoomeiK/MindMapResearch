I had issues sleeping, picking my hair, restless etc when withdrawing.Also i was in constant paranoia that i will relapse and end up in hospital..a lot of intrusive toughts for example:

I was watching a movie and i had toughts that i gonna end up insane in hospital etc...well i just ignored toughts and with time they faded away.

Anxety came back aswell few months after..manly because zyprexa made me sleep much more better than without it.

Even though I do not advice quitting your meds, but if you are taking starting dose of prozac = 20mg it can be discontinued safely due to mega long half life of drug.

No one actually knows why is your depression worsening but SSRI definitely make fatigue worse.

Basically antidepressants make you numb so that you forget your feelings of doom and deep despair and try to ""move on"".

Quitting SSRI can make you feel: rebound depression, rebound anxiety, insomnia(makes depression worse), and tons of other problems aswell.

I also want to discontinue my meds but unfortunately im stuck in unstable mood patterns and it gets even worse when i discontinue some of meds that remain in my regimen.

I dont want to make your fears worse, but you can actually feel worse if you quit taking it, since that happened to me aswell.
