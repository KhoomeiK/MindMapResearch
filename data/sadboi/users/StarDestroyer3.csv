Your current sidehop thing makes it extremely difficult to do it the right way, ""shifting from behind of your body"".

One thing that might be causing your rounding is your really early reachback. Try hitting the peak of the reachback at the same time your front foot hits the ground.

Another thing causing your rounding and also causes other major issues is that you're not doing an x-step. You're basically just doing a sidehop while you should be crossing your left foot behind the front foot to turn your hips back.
