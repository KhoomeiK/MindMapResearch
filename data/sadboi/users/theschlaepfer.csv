Coffee,fpkbbds,t3_gdy8fp,1588691542.0,"I’d ask yourself what you want out of a pour over. An aeropress can produce very similar results to a V60 with a light body and clearer taste.

If you want to give V60 another shot, try following a recipe and only adjusting grind size, keeping all other variables the same. A recipe that really helped me when I struggled with V60 is the 4:6 Method.

I have a Kalita Wave and I love it, but I don’t really have a preference vs the V60. Both are great, very capable drippers. But I’m sure a Melitta dripper really isn’t far off if you’re concerned about price."

It’s a game you can play through to the “end” in a handful of hours, but the game repeats after that, and part of it is to take new paths and discover new areas and secrets on subsequent journeys. The main “story” is pretty stunning, IMO. Came close to tears from sheer beauty near the end.

A big part of the gameplay loop is unlocking new outfits/emotes so if you aren’t into that you’ll likely be a bit disappointed. It also has micro transactions which is a bit of a bummer but I get it, devs gotta eat. The core of the game is solid tho."

I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. I work for a pretty large retail company that’s giving all employees disaster pay through the end of the month.

There’s some pretty specific stuff in a lot of recipes (see James Hoffman’s V60 video). Adding a “Custom” step to the recipe maker so we can enter straight text would be nice.

I’d also love to see an option to have a timer run throughout the recipe. Like, when you click next to the bloom stage, the timer begins and the rest of the steps auto-advance based on the timing of the pour. That way you could go entirely hands-free during the brew.

Again, I really love the idea of this app, and the UI design is just gorgeous. Looking forward to how you’ll add to it in the future!"
