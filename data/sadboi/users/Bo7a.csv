Not naive at all! Your question is perfectly logical.

I'm from Canada where they treat their beef much worse than here in CH. 

Most beef where I grew up and cooked as an adult is raised purely on grains and silage.

To most Swiss/EU people the beef tastes very bland in Canada and the US.

> And why not refrain from meat completely?

this one is more complex. I have a number of digestive diseases (Crohn's, ileitis, and polyps) As such i can not process most vegetables, and any seeds/grains are 100% out of the question. Especially during a flareup.

I figured there probably just isn't a lot of grain farming happening here that gets fed to cows :)

I actually am aware that my taste issue is ridiculous, and I suffer from it by having such a limited range of things I can enjoy.

When I was in university I was part of a study to identify 'super-tasters' and I was the 'worst' case. 

Even simple things can trigger my distaste. To me cucumbers taste bitter and soapy, watermelon candy tastes lke stomach bile, and anything at all with high omega-3 fats (fish, grass fed chicken eggs, grass-fed beef, etc...) tastes like strong fish smell and triggers my gag reflex.
