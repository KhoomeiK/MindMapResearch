But one thing I've realised is that no one has life figured out most people make mistakes and learn as they go. And that is exactly what am doing at the moment, I got a minimum wage job recently  but with an opportunity to learn and advice my skills. I suggest you do the same (minus the minimum wage part, in my country we don't have too many options). 
Everything will work out just fine."

So if you are from Kenya you must have heard of it, they call it Wash Wash. So a long time ago while still in college some guys tried to recruit me, basically how it works is that they claim to be in a position to print money but they need real currency to ""extract the texture and colour'. Needles to say the victim looses their cash.
This scam has soo many players from young girls in uni to high-ranking police officers.

Ooh and it goes together with the infamous 'cheap gold from Congo scam'"

Okay NTSA is rotten to the core, in most of their offices once you get to the gate and ask for directions you'll be redirected to a TENT set up somewhere in a corner, there they can get you one in a week but being a foreigner it'll cost you A LOT

Then I got a job, it ended, I was broke couldn't pay rent, swallowed my pride and went back home. I got another job far away this time and it too came to an end, by this time I was 25and simply couldn't live in with my folks,so I resigned to doing menial jobs and I had to live from hand to mouth for a looong time before I finally secured a somewhat better job."

confession,fixvh22,t3_f9jauw,1582827372.0,"I can relate, I used to smoke weed like all day every day, but I stopped. I also used to hear voices, people talking about me in a very mean way and it affected me soo bad. I became withdrawn and I literally lived in seclusion. Even decided to confront said people but after walking outside in the farm at 3am holding a machete and a torch, I realised I had a problem and went to hospital.
Now get this, I was told its caused by chemical imbalances brought about by heavy use of weed or alcohol or most other drugs. I got medication and the voices stopped am now living a blissful life.

I advise you do the same.
Cheers mate!"

I had just arrived from the mountain region with a few rolls of my favourite stuff. It's around 9pm and I share a joint with the estate gate man who was my pal - or so I thought! An hour later we are having our dinner when the cops come, they don't even knock, they just start trying to break down the door. We give in and open letting in a dozen cops. We receive one hell of a beating and they ransack the house, obviously they found the drugs which I had not put any effort in hiding.
I was arrested together with my bro and put in one of those police lorries. I later came to learn that the gate man had sold me out - 'like seriously??'. Worst part was spending two nights in Kayole One police station with over 100 other men. They would bring us food in a bucket and a bunch of bowls and we would literally fight for it. There is this part of the cells that is like a big cage, you can see the moon at night, that's where most of us would sleep in the cold for the inner cells were occupied by the real gangsters of Kayole. And btw I reformed, that was the last time I was arrested!"
