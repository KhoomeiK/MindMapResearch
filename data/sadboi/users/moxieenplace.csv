Make your meal flexitarian, and only make a small portion of meat for him. For example, make your taco bowls with vegan black beans for yourself, rice, guacamole, what have you... make a small (4oz) portion of chorizo for him “as a topping.” How you present is up to you — you can portion out the bowls yourself or let him do it. He may eat it all in one serving, and if so then the second serving will end up being meatless. It also doesn’t force you to eat meat when you don’t want to, doesn’t limit your choices of what to have for dinner, etc. It has been working really well for us, and now my SO voluntarily goes meatless a few times a week."
