It kinda pisses me off that people think it's weird for you to not have kids- and also just the whole general attitude of ""check out this sociopath over here who doesn't want/have children...yikes.."" 

There is nothing wrong with 30+ year olds being childless. A lot of the quick-to-judge people don't pause to consider the reasons behind it. 

In my case, I made peace with the fact that my body is not a kind host to an embryo (early term miscarriages). I'm now okay with the fact that I will be skipping parenthood (unless I adopt.)

In your case, the right time and person have yet to present themselves. You have been responsible and have held your standards high, which is commendable. 

And every other individual has his or her reason(s) for forgoing parenthood. 

I say: keep doing you. The right woman won't think you are weird due to your not having children. :)

OK, Ima step off my soap box now ;)"

Imo, it isn't that younger people necessarily have life easier per se; but the struggles vary greatly depending upon age- most of the time. Difficulties are relevant regardless of a person's stage in life though. And age isn't always the most relevant factor; I know 30, 40, 50 year olds who have it far ""easier"" than some of the 17-21 year olds I know. Heck, I know small children who have tougher lives than most adults.
