I was slightly conscious and I could feel my head banging against my headboard of my bed while I was convulsing which gave me a pretty nasty headache. Being shot with Narcan is honestly the worst because whatever good feelings that the high was still giving me was just zapped out of me. I was left feeling pretty sober and lifeless. Do not recommend, it’s pretty miserable."

Normally, you do it in person and state all the ways you’ve harmed them. It doesn’t feel like reaching out, it feels like a catharsis. So, no, I would ignore because it seems manipulative. Maybe the dude is working a program, but I doubt he’s working it right."
