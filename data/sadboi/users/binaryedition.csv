Sadly, drugs don't work for all patients with same efficiency. As I know, the allele variants of CYP2D6 gene are important for escitalopram, fluoxetine and risperidone metabolism. 
Please, don't give up. I hope that the ultimate cure will be invented soon or personalized medicine will find its way to provide the suitable treatment for everyone."

bipolar,ex6tr5j,t1_ex6brqz,1566051325.0,"psychotherapy as a whole specialisation has appeared here quite recently. speaking about the mental health issues is kinda hard in russian society. in soviet union psychiatric hospitals were associated with prisons, not with a place where you might get any help: a soviet man had to be a socialistic superhuman without negative traits, so people with mental illnesses were hidden and usually forgotten. 

also they got a ""wolf ticket"" prohibited them to work. plus, the neighbors, the former colleagues, all of them know that, and the word ""psycho"" was associated with serial killers and dissidents lol (i.e. very bad guys).

post-soviet's and today's situation is partially explained by this constant fear that a person with a such diagnosis is marked and would be thrown away. during the last decade or two, people recognise more about mental issues, psychiatrists take patients not only in state hospitals, so we're just getting started. :) 

as for me, I was a child, then a teenager before those changes in the healthcare system. I was diagnosed with neurological issues including seizures. my family denied to accept this, because I hadn't real epileptic convulsions. as a result, they've just stopped bringing me to the doctors. due to, ummm, difficult circumstances a psychiatrist inspected me when I was already 22yo."

I suppose the prescriptions here are similar to ones in your country including seroquel/risperidone + lamictal/carbamazepine/valproate, not sure about lithium. chlorpromazine isn't an unusual choice too.

also we have periciazine. there is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man taking 6 drops of periciazine three times a day...

it's hard to find a psychiatrist which would personally interact with a patient. usually they listen to the complains and prescribe medication/change the dosage without any personal involvement. 

however, several types of therapy are partially presented, e.g. cognitive-behavioral, art-, play-, gestalt therapy and even psychoanalysis (ja ja freud is here), but a lack of specialists is appalling. a psychotherapist must be officially licensed as a psychiatrist (i.e. physician) and have additional psychotherapist certificate; people with other backgrounds aren't allowed to deliver a therapy. nevertheless, psychologists may counsel and set up a ""meeting"", where you may talk with people aaaand that's all. not very helpful.


oh I forgot to say something important, so here's P.S.:
in russia, teens are diagnosed with bipolar disorders on very rare occasions. they receive the same medication, but in smaller dosage for coping with cyclothymia. sometimes it would develop into BDs in adulthood despite the prior medical assistance."
bipolar,ex5s16i,t3_crj3v4,1566030635.0,"I always experience them during the ""solar"" phase, can't remember even a single episode in the ""lunar"" one.

it's often something related to music; I usually start to hear chanting in tap water, car tyres are producing some techno sounds etc. That's quite relaxing until the paranoia shows itself or melodies become annoying repeating like on a broken record.

I used to think that hallucinations result from the most obsessive and frequent thoughts, but it seems to be partially wrong. I'm not a musician; moreover, I'm completely tone deaf lol, and my singing voice should be registered as a deadly weapon; I usually don't recognize instruments playing in my head and can't repeat or remember the tune.
In my case there were only a few occasions when something borne in mind directly affects hallucinations: e.g. that night when I finished ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" and heard someone calling me ""the colonel"" (lmao).

how close are your hallucinations to your recent thoughts, lads? it would be also interesting to meet someone who's hallucinating in ""depressed mode""."
