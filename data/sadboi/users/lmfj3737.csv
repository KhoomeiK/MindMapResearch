worldnews,flnbb7l,t1_flmhass,1585314582.0,"Yes. I feel like my family and I had it. Super fevers and body and chest pain that was almost 2 weeks. The fever fluctuated and chest congestion as well as upper respiratory. Cough cough cough like crazy. 

My kids missed almost 2 weeks of school in total at the end of January and beginning February. I even flew on a plane Jan 31 - Feb 2. It transferred to friends and family quietly then all of a sudden blamo another family was down for the count. 

Many people were saying it was a super flu. I was saying it was Covid in January and people said I was being too paranoid. I feel like these numbers were delayed and this virus started sometime early December. Which would make it extremely plausible that by mid January we were experiencing what we thought was a super flu but really covid. 

I don't think the above poster was calling it a flu, imo. They were saying could this super flu we experienced in the beginning of the year actually be Covid in retrospect? My unprofessional and personal response is a yes."

Everything is fear based online and I'm sucked into it every time.

No one texts me. I dont care  for upvotes or posts by friends. I'm just worried. Worried I'll miss something big and important. So worried that I desensitize from my physical reality.

Thank you for posting this. I see how bad I am and i know my kids are at a point where if I don't change their lives are gonna be fucked up too. And that will be no ones fault but my own. 

I had a dear friend who I asked this question to once tell me ""Choose Differently"". When she was in a situation she would pause, acknowledge how she felt then make her choice to act differently than what her emotions wanted her to. 

I try so damned hard to choose differently. I hear her voice say it. Yet I rage."

I'm petrified of my 2 1/2yearold daughter. Shes our 3rd kiddo and shes an absolute terror to me. Everyone thinks she so sweet and cute. I get shoes thrown at me. Screaming and kicking. I've legit got chest pains (anxiety?) And other physical pains from this. Im afraid to fall asleep because I'm afraid to get beat up the next day.

Fast foward 2 years later, shes inNYC and we drive to see her. Wait till after the show where she comes out and says,""you're the girl that cried in Boston"".

relationship_advice,fbptots,t3_edvvxy,1577024929.0,"Hey there. My advice is to listen to both side. Listen and not react. While you might not agree with how mom handled it back then please try to let her do it the right way now. You know your mom loves you. And you know your father loves you too now. And that's incredible to have. 

I would be furious for the record, I think,  if i was in this situation.  Just understand that the past mistakes can still be made right when it comes from the heart. I bet it's a shock for mom too to have to confront her past, her mistakes, and her decisions that looking back dont look to be the best. I bet she's realizing a lot now as well. 

If you want to have the family that is open and honest and loving then we have to accept that we all make mistakes. We all make decisions that at the time seem to be the right decision and sometimes those decisions turn out to be the worst decisions made. 

I'm happy you found your father. I'm happy you found a loving family excited to have you in it. My advice would be to sit, listen, and try to hear and try to love. We can all change. And I bet this has changed your mother as well. 

I hope you are all able to find support and love. I hope I didn't offend and that my thought came out the right way."
