Hijabis,fc2a2k1,t3_efo9ju,1577347945.0,"Honey slowdown and relax, you're making this way too hard for yourself. 

First of all, I get it. I live in the middle east and I know what kind of toxic, sexist culture you're talking about. I grew up in this environment and all my life I had the exact same fears. I truly hated being a female everyday, and it must be harder for you because you have male brothers. But really it doesn't have to be that way. You just need to be focused on choosing the right person that agrees with your views. Believe it or not, there are liberal, open minded Muslim guys in the world, yeah I know it doesn't seem that way and honestly not the majority, but they do exist, I promise, I'm married to one. We are partners, we both work and share bills and housework and responsibilities.  We make decisions together because we are equals. We fight and scream at each other many times of course, but at the end, we respect each other and we know our boundaries. Those boundaries are yours to set from the very start. When you meet someone and intend to get engaged and married, talk about these things. Make sure he understand you're not to be ordered around, yelled at or treated like an inferior. If you want a career, make sure he knows and supports that. Talk about sharing responsibilities and raising kids together. My husband learned before we had our child the I expect him to take turns with me waking up during the night for feeding and changing the baby's diaper. 

I'm not telling you dreams and fairy tales. This is actually true and happens with many couples I know. You may find it impossible to find a man like that, but it's your future, don't settle until you get what you want. And if not, so what? Try to find your independence from your family. Have a job and a steady income. You can even try to move out later and have your own place. I know I know, that's taboo in many traditional families, but take baby steps and you can break free. You don't have to live this dark life your imagined for yourself. It truly is just a stupid cultural thing and have nothing to do with Islam. And I'm really not gonna get into a debate about that Hadith you mentioned, but divorce is halal, if you're unhappy you can get divorced, that's enough reason, it's not the end of the world.

Try to be brave and stand up for yourself. As long as you're not doing anything haram, then to hell with tradition. Cheer up sweetie, it's not that dark, it just needs a lot a fighting for your rights, the ones that Isalm gave to you, and it's worth it in the end."

My story is different though as before that, we weren’t really having much sex anyway, but that was due to us being young and inexperienced and some other issues with work and school. We now a have a kid and I truly regret all the wasted pre-kid time! 
Anyway I just wanted to ask about a specific part in your post. You said you now try to have sex even if you’re not feeling like it. I’m trying that too and I really am in love with my husband and attracted to him. But I just don’t enjoy it! Will I always feel that way? Is that just the way I am?
