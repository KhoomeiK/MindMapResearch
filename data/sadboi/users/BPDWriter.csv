BPDmemes,f39fsy8,t3_deceqb,1570747598.0,Wow I am the opposite. My memories are in technicolour and literally filled a whole memoir...twice over.
BPDmemes,f39fb66,t3_desrmq,1570747420.0,Can I share to my Facebook page?  If you designed the meme I can write your name on the post
BPDmemes,f31ls82,t3_df3udg,1570578644.0,"My whole mood, outlook and day in general practically always depends on how my FP and I are getting along. So co dependent"
BPD,f313epq,t3_df2aqi,1570567329.0,"This resonates with me a lot. I often wonder when it is all over and I am back to 'normal' whether it was really as bad as all that. But then it happens again and while I am in it, yes it is that bad and worse. I make myself go back to it now and write it out as if I am in it. For some reason this makes it more concrete for me and helps my awareness around my patterns."
BPD,f2zzobp,t1_f2zxt13,1570542923.0,Haha yes you are so right
BPD,f2zi0gc,t1_f2zhnrt,1570522964.0,Yes that also makes a lotnof sense and even more so if that person knows us.
BPD,f2zdkzl,t3_deqat2,1570516206.0,Dating and relationships are my biggest triggers.
BPD,f2t5q7v,t3_de0unz,1570391051.0,"You just answered your own question with this post. You over share and they become disinterested. We give out these massive disclosures and it puts people off. 
Could you look at maybe writing down all the things you want to disclose as that is a great way of offloading? Do you have a therapist at all? I have learnt with age not to disclose so much and it was difficult to learn but I now have more friends from not giving into my urge to disclose everything.
I feel your pain but you can change this.‚ù§"
BPD,f29a3rq,t3_dcklry,1570087869.0,"This is a great metaphor and it is so true. We need that validation. I wish I could learn to validate myself more and therefore need external validation less.
Thanks for sharing this"
BPD,f21n42z,t3_da3w49,1569874207.0,Hi thanks for reading and commenting. I really hope this helps your boyfriend to understand you better. Sometimes it just helps to know we qren't alone and it helps our loved ones to know that we aren't behaving like that in order to deliberately hurt them; we do this because we are struggling to deal with our thought and emotions. X
BPD,f21bmhk,t1_f20oiqs,1569870278.0,Thank you very much for reading and commenting. I hope you have a better day tomorrow xx
BPD,f1plaub,t3_da3w49,1569683217.0,"I am so sorry you are suffering like this. You are totally right though, we need to learn skills while we are in a relatively good place and practice them on smaller issues while calmer. A book I read when first diagnosed ""Mindfulness for Borderline Personality Disorder"" explains perfectly that we learn to drive in quiet roads on Sunday afternoons until we can build the skills and confidence to drive safely during rush hour on a motorway. It is the same with dialectic behaviour therapy skills. Says me lol. I could do with revisiting skills and practicing a lot more.

I hope your partner does forgive you and that you get the support you need to learn the skills you need. ‚ù§"
BPD,f1pkcz6,t3_da3w49,1569682619.0,Thank you for ypur lovely comment. Writing about my horrible experiences with BPD helps me get more awareness and healing around it all and it makes me feel good to know I can help others like you feel less alone.‚ù§
BPD,f1p5qxl,t3_da3w49,1569672915.0,Hi if you follow my page on  Facebook BPDWriter -  Marie Stella Author you can keep better contact with me there. I always answer my messages there. I was only diagnosed 3 and a half years ago but I found that Dialect Behaviour Therapy really helps me. Looking after myself physically and giving myself lots of holistic care helps too. Message me on my Facebook and I will send you lots more tips.
BPD,f1oo1d5,t1_f1nnkeg,1569653890.0,"I am so sorry to hear this. I remember the first time I split on the guy who I write about here, he wouldn't speak to me for a week and I was devastated. Spent the whole week in an absolute mess then literally begged him to forgive me. 

It is very difficult because when it happens to us we genuinely are out of control of it and it is not our fault but it is no one else's fault either. 
I am also mostly very high functioning which can make it harder for us to get help although I am glad that I can function well mostly nowadays.

It sounds like your partner felt hurt and is now trying to protect herself. Maybe she will calm down and listen to you and you can also seek some help. I look at various online DBT groups as they can be supportive in dealing with various symptoms.

Sending love"
BPD,f1onr3q,t1_f1nu50w,1569653477.0,I am so glad that reading this helped you know that you are not alone. Splitting is a horrible thing to suffer for us and the person we split on. I just wish I knew how to stop it from happening.
BPD,f1nhn88,t3_da3w49,1569617492.0,I can't seem to share a page link. Hope you manage to find it. X
BPD,f1nh0yo,t3_da3w49,1569617077.0,Hi I really feel for you as it is a horrible awful place to be in and I know how hard it is to come out of that place. I hope you manage to get the solution you need to come out of it. Sending you all my love‚ù§
BPD,f1ngujt,t3_da3w49,1569616958.0,My Facebook page is called BPD Writer Marie Stella Author but I will try and share a link for you now.
BPD,f1nfokg,t3_da3w49,1569616169.0,Hi it is on my facebook page :)
BPD,f1n851h,t3_da3w49,1569611162.0,I am really glad it helped you and I hope it gives your partner some understanding about how it is for you.
BPD,f1hfv3z,t3_d9fpyc,1569492570.0,Same. I almost thought you had stolen one of my posts lol. It is the worst :(
BPDmemes,f1he8m3,t3_d8j2bs,1569491566.0,I am having a bad BPD myself today so probably over reacting myself lol.
BPDmemes,f1hdmi9,t3_d8j2bs,1569491183.0,Just wanted to check that. She is really nasty to people who take her memes so it is annoying to see she does it to others. Great meme by the way x
BPDmemes,f1h7gtd,t3_d8j2bs,1569487283.0,"Hey if you are not Thanks it's the BPD from Facebook she is stealig your memes, passing them off as her own and then complaining when others do the same to her. Or maybe it is you doing it to her? Or maybe you are her in which case I need to apologise üòÖ"
BPD,f1ct7gn,t3_d8k8fn,1569365264.0,Really well written and helpful. Shared to my Facebook page.
BPDmemes,f0864co,t3_d42cba,1568475919.0,Number 2...are you having a go at me? üòìüòì
BPDSOFFA,f028max,t3_d3ewzn,1568325632.0,Thank you for being open enough to share this.
BPDSOFFA,f027wy0,t3_d3ewzn,1568325181.0,"A lot of people suffer co dependency so please don't be ashamed of it. It is good to recognise and want to work towards overcoming it and becoming more independent but not good to beat yourself up for it. Remember, the end of a relationship is hard for most people but the ones who appear not to care usually do, they are just better at masking their feelings."
BPDSOFFA,f027bs5,t3_d3ewzn,1568324795.0,"I am BPD and very codependent with the man I love. I really feel for you right now. Ending a relationship and suffering for it and all the while thinking they don't even care is a horrible place to be in emotionally. 
Sending you some positive vibes."
CBD,ezzlqig,t3_d34n3s,1568289005.0,I hope for your sake you are right
CBD,ezzacjk,t3_d34n3s,1568283479.0,I hope you are right
CBD,ezz0fhe,t3_d34n3s,1568278169.0,The huge statistics of vape related illnesses and deaths are not so far off though. At one time people thought smoking nicotine was good for their mental health and for the health of their unborn children and were surprised when it turned out that smoking actually caused cancer and multiple fatal diseases. Vaping is causing yet untold problems no matter what it is you are vaping.
BPD,ezyl7uv,t3_d2tmyn,1568270131.0,"Do you have an account with TheMighty.com
They really welcome blogs such as this and if they publish them you can reach a lot of people. You can obviously write well and have a lot to say so maybe look into this. I write for them and as well as giving me something positive to focus on, I raise awareness and help others too. It is a win win"
BPD,ezus0ge,t3_d2ec80,1568159710.0,"Splitting is one of the worst symptoms of this disorder. I have done work on  finding the middle ground or walking the middle path while on a DBT course and that helped me become aware of what was happening to me and find ways of dealing with it but I think I need to do some more of that work :/
I feel your pain and still suffer it often myself."
BPD,eztnpwm,t3_d1urk3,1568134557.0,Figgybumpudding thank you for that comment. I appreciate it. I too believe most people would have been upset but yes my level of upset was far higher than most!
BPD,ezsjjct,t3_d1t5lr,1568094041.0,Thanks for the supportive words. They mean a lot.  I wreck relationships when I am like this and then later the regret comes when it is too late.
BPD,ezqyu7c,t3_d1urk3,1568065614.0,I feel you. Things which may seem insignificant to others can really bother me. I have totally split on my boyfriend today because he told me he was going out last night when he knew perfectly well we had a date this morning. I am so angry by this and it has bothered me for almost 24 hours now. To me it means our date was not important to him as if it was he would have wanted to be 100%for it not tired from being out til 4am. That is just today's problem. Things like this get me going so badly so much of the time.
BPD,ezqwrcy,t3_d1t5lr,1568064887.0,I am really struggling with splitting at the moment with my eldest daughter and with my partner and nothing helps me at the time. I literally can't break out of it.
BPD,ezqwebw,t3_d1m5hm,1568064764.0,It happens to me a lot. Trouble is at the time I think the pain will last forever and it is like it is going to engulf me. It is only when I come out of it I realise that it wasn't so bad.
CBD,eznzcvm,t3_d1dmhn,1568013982.0,"Granted there are varying degrees of harm but nevertheless, vaping is still harmful."
CBD,eznz1wd,t3_d1dmhn,1568013837.0,"""Chastising someone for vaping"" lol I am simply saying that obviously vaping will harm your lungs so I do not understand the arguments so many are having disputing this. Keep on justifying it. They are your lungs not mine but don't act so surprised when more and more reports come out about vaping related illnesses."
CBD,eznym2b,t3_d1dmhn,1568013628.0,I have had plenty of vices over the years but what they have to do with a simple fact such as 'breathing chemicals into your lungs will harm them' I really don't know. My vices do not change this fact.
CBD,ezm3103,t1_ezln413,1567985614.0,At last someone with some basic common sense!
CBD,ezm2ieb,t3_d1dmhn,1567985376.0,Reading these comments makes me question the intelligence or more to the point the sheer lack of it throughout the human race. Get back to basics. Breathing anything into your lungs other than what you need to breathe is going to damage them. It is as simple as learning 1 plus 1 is 2.
CBD,ezm27w5,t3_d1dmhn,1567985242.0,"Seriously what is wrong with all of you? Breathing anything other than fresh air and oxygen into your lungs is going to damage them no matter what the intent and purpose is. Nicotine, tar, vape, CBD, THC, heroin or ANY TYPE OF SUBSTANCE will damge your lungs. Arguing with this is as stupid as saying fire will not burn you."
BPD,ezirbzr,t3_d15rrp,1567931955.0,All of the above and CBD oil. I take 50 mg daily and it has helped with so many of the symptoms
CBD,eziqbvt,t3_d16rqc,1567931453.0,"I use around 50mg daily and hat has really brought my anxiety levels down as well as reduced the number of and intensity of my BPD episodes. It has also taken away my depression and acne. This is not placebo. When I have used different suppliers my anxiety has returned. The fact is the CBD I use actually does work. 
300mg will make me feel like a zombie. Sometimes I use extra while on my period as I put up to 40 mg a day on my tampons and I feel spaced out from it. No way does everyone need 300mg. Maybe you have a poor quality oil or a hemp oil CBD rather than full spectrum."
BPDmemes,ezigy8x,t3_d16kxh,1567926914.0,Yes! Usually happens after I have been lethargic and depressed for a few days
BPDmemes,ezigtoh,t3_d14226,1567926849.0,So true. Is it ok to share this to my Facebook page? I can put a name or something to give you the credit for it
