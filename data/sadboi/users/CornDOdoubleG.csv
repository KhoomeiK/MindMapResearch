Cardi b can make videos naked because breastfeeding was also in the video and that’s allowed (no hate to Cardi just saying the “money” & “press” music videos took people by surprise), or Jake Paul can post half just lap dances by porn stars in a bed, but if people are conducting investigative journalism (Hansen) that’s not allowed.

This is part of why people were so mad at the Chris Hansen interview with Jeffree. Hansen couldn’t say underaged girls and predation so he kept calling the survivors “young women” which is inaccurate and makes a statement about them that I don’t believe he was trying to make...but if he said the other the video comes down and the entire story is silenced. 

But yeah I don’t believe it was censored to be humorous at all but to prevent the video from being taken down.

What I mean by it isn’t that deep is you have to establish boundaries at some point right? Just because they are your parents does not mean they’re entitled to read your work if you aren’t comfortable with that. I can appreciate them wanting to be engaged but at the end of the day, what happens if you just say no? Are they going to copy your hard drive to find it? Will they prevent you from applying? Probably not.

Like college grades for instance, I taught at my university. Can’t tell you how many parents called me or found my email to check up on “little” 25 year old Timmy. Well in the USA that’s illegal. Timmy is an adult who can share grades with his parents if he wants to. Even if they are paying. I can’t even confirm or deny that he’s in my course.

I think you’re giving yourself a false choice. If you don’t want them to read it, don’t let them read it. It doesn’t have to be rude or anything. But as an adult you’re entitled to privacy, especially on a “personal” statement.

Makeup,fqeqxuu,t3_giaxrb,1589312131.0,"Ardell lashes and kiss lashes! 

The hardest part about some lashes is that the band is really thick and not very pliable or bendy. That makes it really hard to stick on to the eye and or they pop up at the corners irregardless of your eye shape. It’s just tough and takes practice! You can get a multi pack of these lashes on amazon, Ulta, Target, rite aid, etc for under $15 sometimes a lot less.

I am not a beginner and I consistently come back to the ardell Demi wispies and the kiss “chignon”. They are stunning, natural ish but not unnoticeable and they are easy to manipulate.

Other tips:
-if they hurt they’re on wrong! 

TAKING OUT OF THE PACKAGE:
-I’ve ripped dozens of lashes. Heartbreaking I know they aren’t cheap sometimes! Use your finger to not pull the band itself, but press on the lashes and pull down. Think a rolling motion away from the band. This will dislodge them enough to lift them up more easily. Just be gentle. 

LASH GLUE:
-there are many wonderful brands but duo is a classic. I prefer the clear and not the one that dries dark but both work just fine. They have a latex free one if you have an allergy too. I’ve also heard but not used myself that the house of lashes glue is great too. Never use the glue in the package if some brands give you one free (I’m being harsh but I’ve never had success personally)
-if you want individual lashes to use, it’s a different glue and different technique. 

GLUE HOW TO:
-you need a lot less than you may think. Just barely enough the cover the edge of the band. You don’t want a white toothpaste line over the top. Let the glue sit for a while, I usually put glue on them, curl my lashes and do mascara, blow a little bit on the lashes and then place them. USE A TWEEZER. When I was starting off this saved me. Hold the lash in the middle by the lashes with a tweezer and rest it on the middle of your own eye. Tuck the corners in last. Pinch them together with your fingers to blend into your natural lash. 

STYLE:
-wear whatever style you like, no rules! But personally I find the best way to pull off lashes is to get some that are wispy and NOT one length all the way around. That ends up looking fake and cheap. Don’t be afraid of lashes that look a little “spiked” or grouped together (see the kiss chignon style) these blend very well into natural lashes. 

LASH LENGTH:
-I have big ass eyes that are not hooded or obscured and I trim every lash pair I own. Trim from the OUTSIDE. The styles are usually such that they gradually get longer from inside corner to outer edge. If you cut the inside that gradient is lost and it looks weird.

HOW TO LOOK NATURAL:
-I’ve been wearing lashes since the time of dinosaurs and can rarely get lashes without eyeliner to look nice on me, it’s just tough! So I suggest even if you don’t do a wing, tight line your eye, put some blended out smudged eyeshadow or pencil liner, something just small to blend the band into the lashes.

RE-USING LASHES:
-everyone does it differently but I reuse lashes as long as I can. Cheap or not. I advise putting very little or no mascara on them each wear. You can pick the old lash glue off the bottom gently and wear them over and over. Nothing more satisfying than wearing an older pair that’s molded to your eye shape perfectly. I also store my lashes in a pill box to keep them fresh and clean. 

GOOD LUCK BEAUTIFUL! Let us know how it goes :)"

Also why in the hell do you have a hoop in? The movement is likely causing the majority of the problems. The white ring looks like the beginning stages of hypertrophic scaring which can be temporary or permanent (piercing bumps). It should be a flat back labret until it’s fully healed. Imagine ripping a scab off every couple minutes by sliding and turning...that’s the hoop/ horseshoe for you. 

Also how are you cleaning this? Oral piercings heal quickly if you aren’t using an anti microbial soap or a saline solution then start.

If any critical thinking adult can not change their mind in the face of scientific evidence... it’s just dangerous. There are many reasons why life expectancy went from 30-50 to 80-90.

But I think she means any vaccine not related to COVID-19. So tetanus, polio, MMR, HPV, flu, etc that everyone usually receives anyways.

Due to coronavirus many countries are considering mandatory vaccines when it becomes available in order to return to normalcy. Idk if that’s the case in her area but I’d assume so. 

Some people have an issue with that. But I think she’s trying to establish that she’s NOT antivax and believes in the efficacy of vaccines and the science, but that this situation has caused her anxiety and she acted out in whatever way she did.

Edit: I work as a nurse I firmly believe in vaccines and am in no way defending anyone who spreads misinformation. I have no sympathy for spreading falsehoods that directly harm others.

BeautyGuruChatter,fpq909n,t1_fpp9tmc,1588817613.0,"Exactly, and the “you must be new here”. What is this a high school lunch table? Mean girls is a funny movie because it’s ridiculous, wasn’t meant to be an instruction manual. Just plain rude and petty."
Cringetopia,fppfetr,t3_gelwak,1588801284.0,"Disagree, still as much cringe. The dumbest fucking name I’ve ever seen and I thought “Stormi” and “Slash” were pushing it."

Oh and we have the same piercings. I added a tragus and it’s my favorite one so far!"
Mcat,fpirqf8,t1_fpiou3w,1588647232.0,"The story was written by the NY Times based on [leaked CDC PowerPoint slides with data](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6926-mayhhsbriefing/af7319f4a55fd0ce5dc9/optimized/full.pdf#page=1) from a briefing this week examining the effect of these early reopenings.

Idk if it will effect everyone, but certainly could impact some dates in my opinion. I think this is why the only June date added was LATE June. The projections only extend until 6/1/2020 on the data so who knows.

The scary part is based on the projected curve (red on graph), it looks like we haven’t even reached the peak of cases yet as a country."
premed,fpicnog,t1_fphd5wa,1588638182.0,Just worked for me using edge! Make sure to allow pop ups. Chrome I set everything to allow and it still wouldn’t work. Edge is better for this
