BPD,fknvyxc,t3_fjl0dn,1584375049.0,"Sorry guys, I didn't mean to start drama. Just felt a little disheartened by this, and by the attitudes on BPD in general. Truly apologize for my mistake."
BPD,fkngli1,t3_fjkjpd,1584365240.0,"That definitely has happened to me, especially when I'm in a very stressed state, my dreams become very vivid and feel so real. When I wake up, my memory can get jumbled, and I get confused about whether something actually happened or was said, or if I just dreamed it. It usually clears up after a while, but it's a very distressing state to be in. I'm thinking maybe writing my dreams in a journal might help."

BPD,fi9881u,t1_fi8ud0f,1582258020.0,That's such a great way to put it!
BPD,fi980o8,t3_f7346z,1582257871.0,"I've given up trying to explain this to certain people, it's just never worth the emotional toll it takes on me. I get very fired up when I feel like people are being dismissive about any mental illness.

There are some amazing people that can empathize, especially if they have some experience with mental illness. Or they admit they don't know much, but they are willing to learn. That always feels like such a blessing!"
BPD,fi97ex7,t3_f6s99n,1582257431.0,"I definitely get this, especially when I have no energy to appear high functioning. 

When I manage to stabilize my social anxiety and have something to say, the words just come out jumbled and messy. Or I'll freeze up in the middle of a sentence. Plus, I tend to just space out randomly, especially in social situations. Or stay quiet cause I'm having an argument in my own head lol

Sometimes, I can ""pull it off"" and people think ""Awh she's a little eccentric!"" but after a period of time they start to realize that these things aren't quirks, so much as they are manifestations of multiple mental illnesses. 

I got quirks, but my dissociative episodes and social anxiety ain't it."
