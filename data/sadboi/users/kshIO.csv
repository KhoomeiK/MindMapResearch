mentalhealth,fpk9lv8,t1_fpjggmn,1588690622.0,"Great!
It's never too late to learn, especially nowadays with all the resources at our disposal. 
And you'll definetly be good eventually if you keep learning and practicing!

Thinking you'll never be good is needlessly negative, and unrealistic. 

I get how one can become extremely pessimistic over the years, but it doesn't help, and most of the time reality isn't as negative as they perceive.

Anyway, I hope you find a way to feel better."
mentalhealth,fpj69wh,t1_fpj21a3,1588657837.0,"I get you.
Is there something you would like to accomplish in this life? Something that would keep you going.
Something you want to do before you die.

Also, would you consider seeing a psychiatrist?
You may have depression. If you have depression and you're diagnosed, you can be treated. This would probably include anti-depressants, and maybe a more appropriate therapy. 

I think you said you don't take meds because you don't want to risk the side-effects?
If life is so gray and unfullfilling, what are you really risking? Some drowsiness or lethargy maybe? And you could stop anytime, especially at the beginning. 

It may be worth it if it can make you less depressed."

mentalhealth,fpj0be8,t3_gddy1y,1588653132.0,"Really, nothing has been worth living in your life since?
I've had a pretty shitty life, and I was 10 when I started wanting to kill myself.

Life has been hard on me, and it still is, like it may have been on you. Some people are unlucky and have to endure a lot, and I consider myself to be one of them.

But even with all this, I've had good moments. I have hobbies that I'm passionate about, and I'm aware of my qualities, not just my faults.

You're not alone suffering in this life. Most people may have had it easier, some definetly had it harder, because there are always less fortunate than us. Even if it's not much of a consolation, you're not alone in this. If even less fortunate people can endure a hard life, so can you! Proof is you're still here, posting on this sub.

I can't help much. But I'll try. Those are my suggestions anyway :

Find a reason to do everything that will get you towards a better life and a better state of mind/mental condition. Enjoy your hobbies. Make friends, and love them. Be the person you want to be. Try acceptation. Get a better therapist, someone that listens AND talks with you. 

I've found most psychologists do be of little use, but I'm currently seeing a life coach/behavior expert, and she is hundred times better at helping me!

Hang on. You can always choose to exit this life anytime you want. But if you're living it, you should do everything you can to make it bearable, and as enjoyable as you can. 

Sorry if this doesn't help much..."

At first I think ""not doing that now, I'll read it later"", then I don't until I get out of my depressive phase weeks or even months later. 

That's common for people with depression as far as I know.

It may not seem much for other people, but even the most basic things can be hard do to for some, like reading and replying to your message on time. 

Hope you can sort this out.

What works for me is forcing myself to respond as soon as I see the message/call. It takes some effort, and I don't know if I would be able to force myself when I'm in a depressive phase, but at least I do it when I feel okay.

You should definetly see a therapist to work on your problem and vent about your traumas.
