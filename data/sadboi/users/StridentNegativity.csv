The change is so recent that links to the infographics in Google Images and Pinterest still sometimes show the old infographics with many more pants listed as viable for planting. 

As it is, I’m planting a lot of okra since this change. It’s about the only vegetable left that they recommend planting in the summer.

For anyone interested, here are the infographics I’m talking about. Take note of how barebones the lists are for April and May. The watermark stating they were posted in 2017 is simply incorrect.

It has instructions for stovetop and instant pot, but we have only used the IP.

Suggested Modifications for a tastier, heartier soup:
* Double the spices
* Add 2 links Italian sausage - brown on the stove, cut into medallions, and add with the carrots, celery, tomatoes, and spices
* Use the whole can of beans (kidney & cannellini)
* Use the whole can of tomato paste
* Do not add water
* We often do not have onions because they spoil fast for us, so we add 1 tsp onion flakes instead.
* If using frozen spinach, simply add 1-2 minutes at the end for cook time and maybe turn up the sauté setting to high

This has been a go-to recipe for us with the meat shortage. We were able to grab some Italian sausage for spaghetti a few days back, so we added it with good results (see modifications)."

I have also heard that some studies find up to a third of people with asthma don’t have it. I grew out of it and never had success with inhalers. This is the first time they have worked for me."
Asthma,fnt7938,t1_fnt71xf,1587235967.0,"Ah, well, I have never done the peak flows before. I never had much luck with inhalers subjectively speaking in the past, but they are apparently working. They were probably working in the past too, but I didn’t have the confirmation with the peak flows."

stupidpol,fnsr73u,t1_fnsmavt,1587227243.0,"It seemed to have an absurdly high percentage of international relations questions, and many questions (if not most) were rather extreme - they painted the position implied in the worst possible light. However, if you do that in the right way, it could still work.

I just took the abbreviated and the full test. I got fewer 50/50 axis results with the longer one. Only my secularism axis results were within 5 points of each other. I got upgraded to “fanatical secular” on the longer test. LOL

The biggest swing in my results was on the federal/unitary axis. I went from 60% unitary on the quick test to 84% unity on the long one. Maybe my antagonism toward the race-to-the-bottom state politics we see in the US got to me the longer I thought about it.

Why do you hate the test? It isn’t the worst one I have ever taken. Just don’t like how much these tests simplify political beliefs? Too much reductionism? Or is your gripe more of how they framed the questions?"

Anxiety, which sounds like what’s going on here, make all of the above processes worse."
