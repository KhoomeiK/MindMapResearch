OCD,fdebtx7,t1_fddgyzh,1578335603.0,"This is me 100%. My wife and I love watching movies together, but if I’m not in the right mindset or if it’s going to be too late when it’s over then I can’t. 

Sometimes I’m arrested by the thought of committing time to one thing for awhile and then just end up doing literally nothing and it sucks. Good to know I’m not alone with this struggle."
Anxiety,fd655vl,t3_ek57zb,1578185674.0,"Sending some virtual hugs! Bad days like this are exhausting, but always remember tomorrow is another chance to break out of the rut. 

Think of one good thing you can do for yourself and try to make it happen. I was feeling the same way earlier today, but I forced myself exercise and it had me feeling loads better. Hope you feel better soon!"
Anxiety,fcwfi6k,t3_ej29di,1578024294.0,"I just want to say it feels like you're reading my mind. These are all thoughts I've had running through my head after returning to a full-time 40 hour a week corporate office job job within the last 6 months. It's nice to hear someone shares these same sentiments. 

Know it's never too late to try something new to help occupy your mind when you're not at work. For example, I recently took up sculpting with polymer clay after watching some YouTube videos that made sculpting seem relaxing. I'm not very good at it, but I've had fun learning and just letting my creativity go wild. 

I would also recommend volunteering periodically on the weekends if you can. Find something you're passionate about (for me it's wildlife conservation and rescue) and find a local organization you can work with to give back and make a difference. I know this can be a lot to overcome when you have anxiety, but even just going every couple of months can help break up the monotony of working at the same place with the same people year after year. It offers you a chance to meet new people and develop an alternate network of acquaintances while also getting to try out a different style of work without the pressure of having to be good at it. I know it sounds preachy, but it really helps.

Ultimately it's the job that makes the difference. I'm making 2020 the year I move on and try to find a job that I don't hate working at 40 hours a week. 

I wish you the best at coping with this shitty society we've developed. Know you're not alone!"
Anxiety,fcwakuf,t1_fcuqn1u,1578020957.0,"Literally what I'm going through. I really want to leave my current place and keep putting off applying for some new jobs due to some recent intense struggles with anxiety. But with the new year starting it feels like the perfect opportunity to just go for it. So I'm going to apply to at least one job a week. My soft goal is to leave my current job by March. We'll see if that turns out.

Good luck with the job search!"

Also, revisiting some of your favorite movies, especially if you haven’t seen them in awhile, is a lot of fun."

Anxiety,ezc5j0l,t3_d0pmdq,1567830213.0,"You’re amazing for putting yourself out there, it’s the effort that means something. First time volunteer experiences can be tough. But it will get better.

I went through a similar experience. There’s a wildlife non-profit I always wanted to get involved with that I finally mustered up the courage to volunteer for. My first couple of excursions were very stressful but it got better each time because the regulars made an effort to get to know me and vice versa.

However, even though I’ve done my fair share of work for them, I still suffer from that’s anxious little voice in my head that says I’m not good enough, smart enough, or do enough to help compared with the other folks. To be honest, this has kept me from going out in awhile, but they recently invited me to a private volunteer dinner that made me realize they were just happy that I donated any amount of my time with them. In the end I’ve met a lot of great people and I can fee good about the work I’ve done. You have to learn to live with the anxiety in this situation because the personal satisfaction will help with your confidence in the end. 

The organization you mentioned sounded really cool and I hope you get something out of working with them. Good luck! You got this!"

Anxiety,eu54ud3,t3_ceuve8,1563469929.0,"I went through this last summer. It was hard and I didn’t do it without panic. But once the concert ended I felt so good that I overcame the anxiety so I could have a chance to enjoy life.

My advice is to get there early so you won’t be worked up if you’re cutting it close. That way you are just at the venue and will have a chance to calm your nerves while waiting for the show.

Good luck and have fun! You know you can do this!"
Games,eu4noa8,t3_cesusd,1563458895.0,"Right there with you. I really liked the first game and was expecting more of the same with some improvements. What we got was a very polished and addictive town building sim in the world of Dragon Quest.

I was blindsided by how good it is and can’t stop playing it. And when I’m not playing it I’m thinking about little projects and improvements I can make to my farm or island. 

The game’s endless optimism and sincerity is the perfect way to spend an evening after work. Seeing the little hearts left by everyone after returning from an adventure always makes me smile. I can’t get enough of this game!"
