MensLib,fr5btxb,t1_fr3aiua,1589905966.0,">I think at the outset of a relationship, you need to really assess whether the person is a fully functioning, capable adult who runs their life adequately. If they aren't, do not ever live with them.

I find this whole mentality really troublesome, as it subtly implies that disabled people, autistic people, neuro atypical people, etc, basically don't deserve a loving relationship.

It also subtly implies that a person who may become disabled (say a car crash) mid way through the relationship becomes ""dead weight"" and drags a relationship down.

This kind of logic is especially troublesome with ""invisible"" illnesses like depression, fibromyalgia, etc. As these conditions are often jsut written of as ""lazy"" character flaws.

If I had a dollar for every time I was called lazy or worthless during a depressive episode, I'd be a millionaire.

I think a much healthier approach is to drop one's own pretenses about what ""should"" be before taking another person into your life. I think if you're looking at a partner basically as a domestic servant from the get go, it's gonna cause some trouble.

At the same time, I do agree that it's important to assess the other person's values in a relationship to make sure they align with yours, or to make sure that they are not abusive.

But beyond that, I think the rest of it comes down to having earnest communication about one's own priorities, and genuinely hearing the other person's priorities.

I think there's a lot of expectations of mind reading in this whole topic, as well as the blurring of boundaries, and not being able to make clear distinctions between oneself and their partner."

CPTSD,fqwc0tw,t1_fqupibp,1589699135.0,"I agree with everything you said, 100%. Not much I can add.

You mentioned the Marine friend, and yeah, that predatory mentality is even more common (if not expected) in certain jobs like soldier or police officer. I mean think about it: what kind of person feels like they are uniquely qualified to have the power of life or death over others (with a gun), other than a person who enjoys having that kind of power?

And as you said about the conversation on the bus... It's weird to me when someone wishes death on someone they don't like, or just shows utter apathy towards people like that. I have a hard time not caring. Even people who have totally fucked me over in life, I wouldn't wish cancer, death, or suffering on them. I don't understand the bloodlust, or even petty apathy towards others. It's incredibly foreign to me.

And again, as you mentioned, this apathy is so common and deeply woven I to our societies, it puts an empathetic person like myself at a disadvantage. Someone with my same level of skill or competence at a job, will still have an advantage if they are willing to manipulate, or don't care about who they hurt/step on to succeed. They will always have an advantage over me or someone who isn't willing to do that.

It becomes a competitive game of who can use and abuse others the most to get ahead, without getting caught. Especially if all of the awful stories I hear about Hollywood, and all of the #metoo stuff in business and politics is true, which I don't doubt at all. The sheer number of high ranking individuals implicated in sex crimes is upsetting. It implies not just an abstract monetary greed, but a fundamental inhumanity about them -- they don't care who suffers in their path to wealth and success.

My friend made a joke that it seems ad if you basically have to be a pedophile rapist to be a successful politician/executive, or they won't let you indy the club. It definitely sure seems that way.

It makes me think that the money/fame/success really isn't even the goal for these kinds of predatory people. Those things are just red herrings. The goal was always absolute power over other human beings. They get a very specific kind of pleasure out of it. It's the reason why human Bettis invented Slavery. They would be the same kind of people who got a thrill out of owning and beating slaves. But now that Slavery is illegal, they get a thrill out of sexually assaulting secretaries and firing their workers instead. Either that or they purchase illegal seed slaves. New system, same psychopaths.

And so many people are just blind to this problem, or even actively defend it. They fantasize about how they will one day be wearing the boot that gets to stomp on other people's skulls. 

And these people are our neighbors, our landlords, our uncles and aunts, our bosses and coworkers. I remember my highschool English teacher was advocating for another World War, because she said we were overdue for one. She said we needed to ""thin out the population.""

Try to just find time to be fully with yourself and your sensations, without fixating on an image, or fixating on climax. That is, masturbate without a set ""goal"" in mind. Learn to enjoy the process and build a healthy relationship with your own body.

As for capital crisis, yes, ""crisis of over production"" is a unique phenomenon to capitalism.

In feudalistic and ancient societies, the only real kind of crisis was famine (under production of food). But in capitalism we see much more common crisis of over production, which is such an absurd concept.

There are famous photos of farmers dumping barrels of milk and burning crops during the Great Depression, while just miles away people are starving in the cities. These kinds of crisis happen when ""too much"" food (or general goods) are produced during a market crash. When people lose jobs en masse, they have no funds to buy food. 

Since food is created for profit, when people lose jobs and can't afford food, farmers suddenly find themselves with a massive surplus of unprofitable goods. Since it is not profitable to take this food to market, it is destroyed, and people starve.

https://www.foodpolitics.com/2020/04/food-and-coronavirus-update-continued-milk-dumping-and-other-shades-of-the-great-depression/

Its ridiculous and inhumane, but that is the logic of capital. It would almost be hilarious, if all that wasted food wasn't directly contrasted with real human suffering.

We are experiencing this same effect right now, due to Corona. Which is why governments are scrambling to send out cash payments. They aren't necessarily doing it out of kind loving concern for the health of its citizens, but to guarantee that places like Walmart and food producers continue to make profit.

If the government was genuinely concerned about hunger, it could very well setup an emergency ration system, and pay farms directly at-cost for the food. This has been numerous times in war periods or other emergencies.

Because instead of just creating some sort of supply line to make sure everyone is fed as a basic human right, the callous market demands of capitalism require that farmers/grocers/retailers must make profit on their goods. And when the masses have little funds, they can't buy food, so food producers destroy their surplus.

These constant cycles of crisis are inevitable under capitalism, and occur in cycles every decade or so -- though Corona has made this one particularly extreme. It's not always food related, sometimes oil, or gold, or some other stock.

In feudal societies these ""crisis of over production"" could not occur, as peasants produced their own food, tools, and goods. The only surplus created was directly for the aristocratic class (knights, royalty, artisans, etc). But general surpluses were avoided, as it just amounted to extra labor for no benefit.

Generally, market transactions only made up a small percentage of the average peasants activity. Most food and goods were produced at home domestically, trade was less common, and ""merchant"" was a specialized class that made up only a small percentage of the population.

In capitalistic societies, market trade accounts for nearly all social activity. Only a small percentage of the population works in agriculture, thus forcing all other members of society to engage in constant trade in order to eat and live. Almost no one produces their own tools, food, or energy, etc, at home.

Over production, and chaotic market crashes (in this manner) are a unique problem of capitalism. Only under capitalist logic is ""having too much food"" cause for panic and crisis.

It's created by the paradox of highly efficient machines making more goods than necessary, also making lots of manual labor obsolete (destroying jobs), clashing with the need for people to generate a wage in order to pay for their existence. It creates a scenario that requires workers to constantly ""reinvent"" and retrain themselves, often with periods of unemployment, while technology and markets rapidly phase out old methods of production, making worker's skills obsolete.

Instead of technology and machines being used to benefit all of mankind, it is used for private profit, which necessarily excludes anyone from production who can not afford to keep up, or is not deemed ""useful"" in a mechanical sense.

Technology thus takes on an alien characteristic, making many feel isolated and excluded from society. For example, if you can not afford a phone or a car, this is basically damning for employment prospects in many places.Thus, the phone and automobile do not appear to you as ""liberating technology,"" as they are advertised in commercials, but instead appear as an obstacle to your very survival. A tool you desperately need, but are excluded from having.

Its a fundamental flaw of capitalism, even Adam Smith was aware of:

>The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth.

>The rent of land, therefore, considered as the price paid for the use of the land, is naturally a monopoly price. It is not at all proportioned to what the landlord may have laid out upon the improvement of the land, or to what he can afford to take; but to what the farmer can afford to give.

So basically, the private ownership of land essentially creates a monopoly on food (which is essentially a monopoly on human life). Those who own the land, set the cost of living for everyone (and live off of our rents). Prices can be set in such a way as to always extract a profit from people who need to eat (everyone). And since food (and housing) is bought and sold, just as any other commodity, it also has the same alienating character as the phone or automobile: there will always be (under capitalism) a non-zero amount of people who need housing and food, but are excluded from the market by the logic of capital.

It is a fundamental flaw that can not be fixed within capitalism. The only solution is to demand such necessities (like food, water, housing) be regarded as human rights, and not subject to profits, trade, and the chaos of market exchange -- that food and necessities are produced for direct consumption.

And as for making people care... Yeah that one is the biggest mystery to me. It's the old saying: ""You can lead a horse to water, but can't make him drink.""

I've noticed this old phrase applies to a lot of human behavior. You can lead a person in any which direction, but you can't make them think, or care, or change. They have to want that themselves.

I went through years of therapy in my early 20s, and more or less healed many of the problems of my childhood. I overcame severe anxiety, I came to understand that my parents are deeply disordered, I detached from them, I made new friends, I saved up tens of thousands of dollars, I traveled, I made more friends, I got married, I even emigrated to a whole other country, and was starting a new life, etc etc.

Life genuinely went up and up. I had people I loved, and who loved me. I was doing things, and building a career path that felt worthwhile.

And in the midst of this, my wife started an affair, and very swiftly turned abusive. She threatened me, threatened suicide, emptied my savings, turned everyone we knew against me, told them I was the one abusing her. She sexually assaulted me, and left me to start life over from scratch, with nothing, and no one around me to trust.

I now have such awful PTSD, I feel disgusted and threatened when another person touches me, yet alone is even within a few feet of me. I literally have nothing left in my bank account, and am unable to hold work.

Before these events, I was not suffering or unhappy at all. It was such a curve ball. It was not a gradual build up at all. Her personality switched in an instant, and it was revealed to me our whole 5 year relationship was basically an act.

So again, I don't blame myself at all. It happened. It wasn't within my control. I did the best I could to survive and keep myself safe.

I've fallen through the cracks before. I know that it is ""possible to get back up.""

The difference this time is, that I'm just fucking tired. I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of having to make accommodations in my life, having to put in so much effort, just because there are other people out there who don't know how to not rape or abuse others. I'm tired of cow-towing to psychopaths. I'm tired of begging for work, and money, and begging for basic human decency. I'm tired of being knocked down, over and over, and tired of climbing back up. And I'm tired of just how senseless and futile it all is.

Again, I'm not delusional about the possibility for change. I am fully aware that I can climb back up, and I'm fully aware that change is possible. But why bother? I don't care anymore.

I know that life can change for the better. But I'm also aware of how instantaneously it can call come crashing down. There is no such real foundation to our lives. There is no ""continual progress"" or ""path"" to life. It's all an illusion, built on a house of cards. Just ask any of the millions of people who lost their jobs because of tiny microscopic virus. Just ask anyone who slept in the streets of Chicago over the winter.

Even something as mundane as a flat tire, a thunder storm, or random cancer, can completely devastate a person's life, and set them back at rock bottom. I've lived through events like that too. It's all bullshit.

I've never missed a bill payment, or credit card payment. Never even went into debt. I've never gotten hooked on drugs, I don't drink. I keep promises, I pay my taxes. And for what? To be left in the streets penniless, wandering and being told to ""hold on"" and ""it gets better.""

I've watched people kill themselves, and be killed. I've seen children slowly die of cancer. I've had tumors surgically removed from my own body, and suffered infections after. I've narrowly avoided death from car accidents, choking, and other random mishaps a dozen times. Totally random events. You can not honestly look me in the eyes and tell me ""it gets better"" or ""you can climb out"" or that life will ""be"" anything, with any sort of genuine guarantee. There is absolutely no guarantee that life plays out positively over time, or that circumstances will be pleasant or favorable. There is no guarantee that you will grow old, or accomplish anything worthwhile. There isn't even a basic guarantee that I will have a roof over my head, and food in my stomach.

It's platitudes and empty promises.

I've made peace with myself. I don't hate myself, nor blame myself for things that were out of my control. I like myself, and I worked hard to get to that point. That's really all that can be guaranteed.

But out here, out in the external world, the people and events around me? I'm just tired of struggling, and fighting, just for basic human decency. I don't want to do it anymore. I'm tired of screaming into the void. I'm tired of clawing in the dark, trying to find decent fucking people."
CPTSD,fqipdy9,t1_fqfaicn,1589399085.0,"This. It's something I've realized throughout my years of being alive. Predatory individuals just seem incapable of caring about the pain, suffering, wants, and needs of others. Whether that difference stems from their brain structure, or their belief system, or what ever -- all I know is that they have something fundamentally different from me, and how my brain works, and cares for people.

I found this sentiment expressed well in this article: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/i-dont-know-how-to-explain-to-you-that-you-should\_b\_59519811e4b0f078efd98440](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/i-dont-know-how-to-explain-to-you-that-you-should_b_59519811e4b0f078efd98440)

And the trick is, there is just no way to get through to a person who does not care. You can not make a person care about something (or someone). If they do not care, they just don't care.

So, we are forced to live among uncaring people, and kinda just told to pretend they don't exist. And there seems to be a large cultural narrative that ""everyone is doing their part, and trying their best"" -- which is obviously not true, if you've ever met an abusive or sociopathic person.

I don't really have a solution. But being aware of the more dangerous people who weave themselves invisibly into society, is just a disturbing truth to hold.

And having experienced some of these dangerous people first hand, what's probably most frightening about them is just how unaware they are. Most of them just lack empathy, and they assume that everyone else's brain works just like theirs, so they don't even see anything wrong with their own behavior. They assume everyone else thrives on being cunning and dominating, just like them, and anyone who disagrees is just ""weak."""
CPTSD,fqinoqf,t1_fqfspug,1589398430.0,"I completely agree. Yet my hang up comes from the question: what do we do about it?

It seems obvious to me that, people in power are not just going to grow a conscience, and suddenly realize en masse that caring about other people is good for them, and voluntarily relinquish their power over society. And politely asking for better living conditions has never worked. There always had to be quite a large mob behind those demands (which means the subtle implication of revolt was part of those demands!)

So the only other obvious answer to that is, like all other points in history, the people in power will have to be overthrown by force. Such actions will be met with [violent opposition by police and hired guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-union_violence_in_the_United_States). Shit, even peaceful protests are frequently met with violent force. So there is going to be violence happening, whether we defend ourselves or not.

My only real gripe with this, having experienced violence and trauma myself, I just have a hard time imagining any kind of better society emerging from violence. That's not a defense of capital by any means, more so a ""shit's fucked either way"" thought process.

I just don't really see hope for such a brutal ""might makes right"" species such as us. Violent self-serving people have always climbed the ranks and somehow ruled human societies. And I think most people just comply, because the threat of violence for ""stepping out of line"" is terrifying. So thus, ruling classes and oppression were formed when the first person realized they could make someone else do what they want by hitting them with a stick.

And this isn't even unique to human beings, you see the same social power plays in other species (lions, wolves, apes, etc). We've just created very elaborate and complicated ""sticks"" to threaten people with (homelessness, nuclear war, prison, etc)."
CPTSD,fqil1vg,t1_fqfroxf,1589397421.0,"I agree, to an extent. Capitalism is the result of something within us, if not, we wouldn't have created it. But that doesn't really say much, because violence, abuse, love, and kindness, are all within human capacity. So why does cold, callous, dominance hierarchies repeatedly rule over us throughout history? Why do we comply?

I can't say for certain, but yes, it does seem to stem from something deeply animalistic within us.

The Nordic Model isn't really a solution. It is still capitalism, just a slightly less miserable welfare capitalism. And the root problems of capital accumulation are not solved; so wars, crisis, and market crashes are still inevitable.

Besides all that, even in an ideal ""perfect"" society, with social safety nets available, without war or violence, there would still be trauma. Natural disasters, disease, death, etc would still occur, and people's existential fears would not disappear. People would still cling for meaning, and fight over differing meaning systems, because fear would still be a prime emotional experience. The only way to overcome that (if even possible) would be to fundamentally alter our biology, thus becoming something not fully human.

My biggest hangup about people/society is the simple fact that you can not make a person care about something. No matter how well reasoned your argument is, or facts to support your thesis, there will always be people who are just indifferent. I think I can accept the fact that the universe is largely indifferent to our suffering, but watching a human being act indifferent to human suffering (or even outright malicious, or causing that suffering) is something that churns my gut in a way I can not understand.

This kind of sentiment was outlined in this short article: [I Don’t Know How To Explain To You That You Should Care About Other People](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/i-dont-know-how-to-explain-to-you-that-you-should_b_59519811e4b0f078efd98440)"

CPTSD,fqihmj0,t1_fqfmrvi,1589396112.0,"I understand you mean well, no offense taken.

The problem for me is, that I believe in myself just fine. I know that I am talented, funny, kind, and worthwhile. I am not under any delusion that I am at fault for the things that happened to me. Still, that knowledge doesn't bring me any relief, or restore any trust in others. And it doesn't really restore my faith in the many hundreds of people throughout my life that failed me, as a child, as a teen, and as an adult.

My problem is, that I do not hold any extreme views. I do not feels all-or-nothing, one way or the other, about anyone or anything. I feel quite neutral about ""humanity"" or the events in my life. There have been amazing and kind people in my life, as well as absolutely awful people.

But quite frankly, most people are just kinda there. Most people aren't out-right malicious, nor are they particularly caring or helpful. Most people are feel too wrapped up in their own issues, and don't even notice us. They're just perpetually busy. And that's fine. 

So all things considered, when wiping away all of our assumptions about ""good"" or ""bad"" (what ever those words might mean to you), we are still left with: a largely callous and indifferent society. We're left with a social structure where if you ""fall through the cracks"" there is little relief available to you. We're surrounded by so many indifferent people.

You could stand in the middle of a city with a population of one million, begging for help, and still be entirely ignored, alone, and without relief.

When you realize this, it's not at all surprising how mass shooters happen. I'm not advocating or condoning that behavior at all! But if you can understand what its like to be so entirely invisible, so entirely discarded and disregarded by your community, that you feel a need to just explode, scream at the top of your lungs, for some kind of relief... you can imagine the feelings of a disillusioned terrorist, you can logically deduce what leads a person down that path. Unfortunately, they just so happen to take that anger out on others, where as most people in that situation collapse inward and take out their anger on themselves.

I've known too many people who already did that, and they're gone now. Kids I grew up with, who never made it to their 20th birthday.

We've created social structures that churn out depressed, isolated, angry, confused, and alienated individuals, en masse -- like a factory. And by ""we've created"" I mean that these processes were already in place long before any of us were born.

This fact exists, regardless of how I ""feel about it"" one way or the other, or what I might ""believe"" in."
CPTSD,fqid36z,t1_fqf9zyr,1589394390.0,"Same. I definitely say more words on Reddit than in person. And the covid thing doesn't really help that either, as I really only see one or two people any given day now.

Functioning at a bare minimum, is exactly it. I'm just kinda ""here"" and don't feel particularly enthusiastic about any of my interests or hobbies. I can still do them sometimes, and even enjoy them. But then I put the pencil down, or put the book down, and am just left there... staring at the wall. ""Now what?""

Hobbies feel more like a distraction now, than any sort of relief.

All I want is some temporary relief, and yet everywhere I look, I can't find it. I can't even enjoy just staring at the clouds or flowers anymore.

I think my interest stems from similar reasons to yours. Also, from the fact that I find myself pretty much immune to cult-like group-think. I was kicked out of Christian Sunday School for asking too many questions, and not following along obediently.

That's not to say that I am immune to other people's charisma, or the need to belong to something. But I'm naturally super skeptical when the group-think centers around an individual, and not questioning them. And it seems to me that most people don't think this way?

I don't know, I just don't understand it. I don't know what to make of it when I watch a person nod and agree to something that makes no sense, or watch people make logical leaps and mental gymnastics just to rationalize ""yes, we are the same, haha.""

I would rather feel alien and misunderstood, than to believe something which makes no sense, or pretend to be someone I'm not just to fit in.

So, like pulling the load-bearing support beam out from the middle of a house -- we have no choice but to collapse inward. The weight of all of our life experiences, in an instant, fails us, and comes crashing down.

To me, trauma is what's left when all of our previously held assumptions about safety, stabilty, and order, are swept away in an instant. We are confronted with our powerlessness, our fragility, and our lack of control.

Philosophically, this is the aspect I have not been able to overcome.

The crying becomes less and less. Managing triggers is doable, to an extent. Freezing and dissociation happen, but those moments pass, and life goes on. Sometimes I can laugh and feel joy too. Trauma is definitely also all of those physiological responses too! The shakes, the freezing, the palpitations, the panic. 

But my worldview, is permanently changed, and that is the one aspect that's hardest to cope with.

Then again, I'm only just starting trauma-specific therapy. So fingers crossed, and we'll see where that goes."

ptsd,fqeyhrd,t1_fqejnu6,1589315697.0,"This. I've been down that rabbit hole too, and found it doesn't really lead anywhere.

I found myself more curious in somewhat violent sex after a bad a breakup, and the a woman I dated shortly after incouraged it, and pushed me even further.

I feel like the drive to re-enact ones trauma in a ""safe"" way (on the surface) *sounds* reasonable, but on deeper analysis doesn't really make sense. In practice, it's a lot like a person trying to eliminate their nicotine addiction/headaches by smoking another cigarette. Sure it alleviates the pain, tension, and discomfort -- but only in the short term. It doesn't actually address the core issue. No matter how many times you recreate the situation, it won't ever ""feel"" like enough.

Eventually you just become adapted, and chase that ""high"" -- even if that high is based on an unconfortable sexual experinece. This can lead to riskier and more dangerous situations, trying to recreate that original trauma. Indulging in the thing which ultimately caused your trauma/problem/addiction, doesn't actually resolve it.

As another poster mentioned, ""traumatic repition"" is a thing.

Any addictive/compulsive behaviors around sex/food are particularly hard to deal with, because unlike drugs or other behaviors -- you can't really just cold-turkey food or sex. You have to gradually adapt to more healthy coping mechanisms, while still also having to engage with your trigger (food or sex). They're basic human needs.

One *could* theoretically cold turkey sex if you're currently single, but it's difficult if you are currently in a relationship, or bump into someone who interests you. Like food, the trigger/stimuli will be all around you, and impossible to avoid unless you went into full isolation (which is also not healthy).

Also with food/sex, it's not clear cut where exactly the line between normal curiosity, and self harm lies. And it's also probably very specific to the individual.

For example, are you ordering that new Tacobell item as a treat for yourself, or are you just telling yourself it's a ""treat"" to bury/eat your feelings? (I've been guilty of this)

What could be a normal treat/indulgence for one person/situation, could essentially be self harm for another. It's not cut and dry. Same goes for sex/porn habits.

I found that, like you said, therapy itself naturally made my less-than-healthy desires and impulses just fade away on their own. Even when the therapy had nothing to do with the specific events.

Its a struggle for sure. But worth it.

I'm not convinced of the popular BS that ""shame is wrong, never feel ashamed of anything."" If that were true, one could justify any kind of awful behavior, towards yourself or others. At a very basic biological level, the feeling of shame is trying to guide you towards actions that prevent you from acting out desires that bring you more pain. Shame can be used for good or bad, like any emotion, to guide us to better behavior, or for oppression.

Its important to be aware of your feelings of shame, and ask yourself where these feelings are coming from, and if they are protecting you from darker impulses, or are preventing you from expressing yourself healthily. And also, if these feelings of shame are coming from within your own ethical code of conduct, or are being imposed upon you by an external voice (or even the voice of a past abuser, now in your head!). It depends on the situation.

And one should not simply rebel/indulge, just to spite some ""other,"" without some consideration of whether these actions bring you closer or further to your own overall goals in life. I think a lot of people act out of spite when they escape from oppressive family/religious organizations, even if the spiteful rebellion doesn't really make them happy.

They're just so sick of feeling shamed, that they want to ""prove"" something, and end up turning their life into a performative antithesis of their childhood/abuse. They become shameless, and do things they are deeply not proud of, or harm others in irresponsible ways."

I mean, what exactly is a conscious animal *supposed to* feel and think, when they are stripped of agency? When none of the choices presented before them seem to secure their immediate safety?

I'm sure the above description probably describes many of our childhoods: knowing something is terribly wrong, but not having the agency to flee or fight back.

And for those who experienced trauma in non-childhood settings, I'm sure it's not much different. You were put into a situation where your safety was not guaranteed, and either physically could not flee, or saw no option to remove yourself safely from the situation."

Not being able to remove ourselves from a dangerous situation (due to financial reasons) literally violates all of our animalistic instincts.

But when the ""dangerous situation"" is all around you (threat of homelessness, isolation, threat of compliance by force), you literally have no where to run to. With no recourse from our suffering in sight, we collapse into ourselves -- we become depressed, alienated, perpetually anxious, traumatized.

At some level, I almost have to just assume that it was all an act, even if it wasn't all an act -- even if there were genuine moments. Because I can not know for sure.

But it also protects the ""performatively innocent"" like cluster B people, and gives malicious individuals the benefit of the doubt. And cluster B's seem to get away with all sorts of wild accusations anyway, and often get innocent people sent to jail.

So really, ""innocent until proven guilty"" in actuality, seems to only really benefit those willing to manipulate that trust.

I don't really have a solution to that problem, just an observation. The assumption of innocence is a vital pillar of what makes our current justice system leaps better than previous eras.

But it seems like there needs to be something in place that can take into account a person's larger character/history, or at the very least acknowledge personality disorders as what they are, and not just assume that those people are operating on the same sense of morality as the rest of us.

Anyone trying to convince you that non-monogamy is better, ""more spiritual,"" more evolved, ""human nature,"" or superior to monogamy... is full of shit. 

They are either lying to you, or lying to themselves (even if they genuinely believe it). And there's probably nothing more detrimental to a relationship than a person who isn't honest with themselves and what they want, attempting to use something (like monogamy/nonmonagmy/polyamory) or someone (!) to avoid dealing with internal issues.

There isn't anything fundamentally (in essence) different between a monogamous relationship and a non-monogamous one. The only difference is that there are more people involved, thus more relationships and feelings involved.

There are unique issues and challenges to such dynamics for sure, with hundreds of books written on that subject. But at the end of the day, you are still essentially dealing with one-on-one relationships with a single person, just multiple of them at a time.

The logic that poly/non-mono is objectively superior, is about as moot as trying to make the argument that having 3 children is objectively superior to having 1 child. 

Its absurd to argue that raising one child ""doesn't work.""

Whether you have one child, or ten, or one partner, or ten... you are still forming some kind of bonds with real people, and all of the traits that would apply to being a good friend/brother/parent/partner or whatever, still apply.

Gaslighting and dishonesty is still detrimental, and compassion and kindness are still beneficial.

I can almost guarantee 100% that your person has BPD. There's so many signs.

Look into something called ""quiet borderline"" and also check the ""quiet borderline"" flair on this sub.

Quiet borderline doesn't present itself like classic borderline. They tend not to have weekly rages, and can ""mask"" their emotions for years. Then, it all comes out at the end of the relationship -- when they find a new ""supply"" (cheating) and latch onto a new person.

The quiet borderline can appear to be happy and normal for years. They will agree with what ever you want, promise you marriage, a family, etc. But they feel ""empty"" inside, and secretly hate themselves. They actually do ""rage"" frequently, but their ""rage"" is internal, towards themselves. Their abuse themselves internally, and it can be totally invisible to us.

That is, it stays invisible, until they build up too much pressure and explode. Which is what you saw when they start hitting themselves, cutting, and abusing themselves, and threaten suicide.

We both still cared about each other, but the relationship had run its course. And due to circumstances (mostly financial) we kinda just stayed together a little longer than we probably should have.

The BPD relationship, I did not see it coming. Just days before the revealing of an affair, and her total meltdown, were some of the happiest days of my life.

I just found out yesterday that my dad's workplace has been infected. So fingers crossed there.

Weird times."

BPDlovedones,fputc3l,t1_fpuc75v,1588923009.0,"Yeah, it did suck, to put it lightly. She left me with some kind of PTSD too.

I also have been looking back, like you said, sometimes wondering what I could have done differently. But there's really nothing I could do. I was blindsided, didn't see it coming at all. The switch in her behavior was so very sudden. One week we were cuddled up at home, ordering pizza, playing video games together, celebrating her success in her career, and working on my own career prospects.

Then one day she just comes home and tells me she's in love with her coworker, and that I have to give her permission to go on dates with him, as a side boyfriend. When I said no, she pulled out every BPD trick to get her way. Rage, guilt tripping, screaming, intimidation, suicide threats, isolation, coercion, etc.

Its unreal.

I often think to myself, that had we lived in the same city, how different it would have been. I would have seen her more often, likely every day. I might have moved in with her after a year. Her engulfment fears would have been triggered way earlier, and she would have likely done all of this meltdown much much sooner. The cheating and discard would have happened in 2014 or 2015, instead of 2019.

How much time and sorrow I would have saved myself. And all those wasted years, filled with false memories built on a lie. Thousands of dollars down the drain on wasted immigration fees.

It fucking sucks.

But it didn't happen that way. I have no doubt that the long distance was able to sorta prolong the honeymoon phase, because every time we visited each other, it was like a mini vacation. She never had time to get sick of me, and start devaluing me."

BPDlovedones,fpu0z1n,t1_fptzdn4,1588902345.0,"No, she was never diagnosed. But I had no doubt after the smear campaign. She had all 9 of the BPD traits.

She was diagnosed (throughout her life) with various other disorders. PTSD, cptsd, ADD, ADHD, schizo affective disorder, OCD. None of those really seemed accurate to me, to my knowledge of the disorders, and it also sounded like she had some quack doctors as a child.

I knew she had issues, but nothing stuck out to me as personality disorder. They didn't seem like issues that couldn't be resolved with therapy. Her symptoms mostly showed as depression-like, and considering her history of childhood sexual abuse, that didn't seem strange to me.

I just loved her, and was patient when she needed extra space.

That and I, naively, used to believe that anyone can grow and change with therapy. Because I myself had made a full recovery in the past from very severe debilitating social anxiety disorder.

I underestimated the depth of her issues.

As for her rage at the end, it started when she ""fell in love"" with a coworker (new supply). I was kinda sick at the time and seeing doctors about my issues, so I probably wasn't as affectionate as she expected me to be.

She devalued me, and was love bombing him. After that, I was suddenly the worst person in the world, and abusive and controlling.

Typical BPD stuff."
BPDlovedones,fptzld8,t1_fptxp9d,1588901510.0,"It was probably us moving in together. Our relationship was long distance, so we had lots of time apart, which kinda indefinitely prolonged the love bombing. Or at least that's my guess.

We would see each other once or so every other month, for a week or two. And made constant Skype calls.

When I moved in with her, we only lived together six months before she started having meltdowns. Accused me of ""controlling her"" (engulfment fear).

I had no idea what BPD was until after she cheated and devalued me. And neither did she.

Her therapy was mostly centered on her childhood sexual abuse. I'm not aware of the contents of her therapy sessions, because I respected her, and told her she could talk to me only if she felt comfortable to. So sometimes she would tell me how it went, other times not.

I suspect she wasn't actually improving much with therapy, but was really learning to mask better. So the issues only seemed more resolved on the surface. The core problems (BPD) were never really addressed."

I need to see the name and face to associate them together. I just absolutely forget any name I hear.

Oddly though, I can remember faces easily. I can remember a face, and almost any convo we had. Even people from like 1st grade. But not names.

BPDlovedones,fptstd0,t3_gfeis8,1588897553.0,"Quiet borderlines are weird.

Mine did the first two steps (lovebomb and Boundary testing). She pushed some boundaries pretty far, but nothing abusive or too severe. Our relationship wasn't exclusive from the start, and she had some not so great beliefs about sex and intimacy. She did some questionable modeling photoshoots, and had a few friends with questionable intentions. I figured it stemmed from her childhood abuse, and we had talked about it openly. But regardless, I wasn't tolerating it. 

I told her I wanted exclusivity, that she also needs therapy. I considered leaving if she gave any push back, or showed no improvement. 

She agreed and went to therapy for years. I saw lots of improvement, and no setbacks, so I assumed she was genuinely healing. And we talked a lot throughout the process, and it seemed to be going well. She never blamed me for anything, only thanked me for being patient and caring. Just up and up progress.

It took 5 years to reach step 3. Then, all at once, the abuse and cheating exploded out in the final 3 weeks. I attempted to JADE briefly, to see if there was any rationale left in her, but was only met with rage. I tried reasoning with her, but she didn't want to reason. And after that, I lost hope, and left her.

But those nearly 5 years between were pretty great. It really fucks with your head.

When you tell someone ""you need therapy"" and they respond ""you're right, I'm gonna do that, I want to be better""... and then they do that... It makes the eventual abuse even more alienating and terrifying.

When I was in 2nd grade I had an outbreak that was so bad, my entire mouth was basically crusted shut. It physically hurt to open my mouth, but I had to eat... I remember being at school, eyes watering from the pain, and it really hit me when I openened my mouth to take a bite of a PB&J sandwich. I could feel the sides of my mouth ripping open, and the bread of my sandwich was covered in blood from the open sores bursting. Besides the pain, the ostracization at school didn't help.

Not everyone responds well to medications, nor has harmless outbreaks. Especially people who are immuno compromised in some form. I'm 30 now, and I still get outbreaks every few years -- luckily, never as bad as that one time.

It is an infectious disease. 

I don't feel like it should be stigmatized, but also definitely should not also be downplayed like it's not a big deal.

I got similar responses from people when I told them I was given HPV. A lot of the ""Everyone has that, it's not a big deal, blah blah stigma!"" But they tend to shut up quick when I inform them that it's a cancer-causing strain, and I had to have invasive surgery in my throat to remove a tumor.

People like to talk a lot about ""no big deal,"" but change their attitudes quickly at the prospect of contagious cancer.

Like you said though, I really hope they can find a cure for herpes and HPV. This shit is not cute. And a lot of people out there having unscrupulous casual sex spreading a lot of shit without knowing they even have it. Especially with how long these virus's dormancy period is.

ptsd,fppq4c7,t1_fpotp35,1588806987.0,"I feel the same.

That kind of positivity is called ""toxic positivity"" for a good reason. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having negative feelings, to be sad, greiving, or upset. In many cases, it is very appropriate to feel so.

And sometimes these feeling of deeper meaninglessness, despair, etc., come from a very rational and reasonable place. 

Some months ago, I wrote a list of experiences in my life that had profound impact on my understanding. Events or experiences that revealed a certain truth about reality to me. Some of the experiences were quite traumatic, others quite mundane. Enlightening nonetheless. Unfortunately, I realized after writing this list, many of the ""truths"" I wrote out were quite dark, or negative in nature. Not all of them, but most of them.

What's interesting about these truths that I've noticed, is exactly that they are true, regardless of whether one ""believes in"" them or not. They are, in other words, self evident.

I kinda wrote out this list, maybe as an attempt at self therapy, or maybe just as an attempt to understand my own perspective better. I'm not sure exactly why I wrote it out. 

Anyway, it's been on my mind a lot lately. And it's something I haven't been able to discuss with anyone I know, because it's too ""heavy"" or depressing, it seems.

And I kinda get it: most people are happy with their illusions, and don't want to hear any information that might upset them, destabilize their worldview, or question their long held assumptions. Or in other cases, it's just too personally painful to go there, and they're not ready. I understand, and don't want to ""drag"" anyone down that path if they aren't open to it.

But still, that leaves me feeling very alone.

Not just that, but also the house-of-cards that is ""civilization,"" and all the baseless and absurd assumptions it is precariously stacked upon. All of the pretensions, suppositions, and lies, that people outright just assume to be True And Natural, in order to convince themselves that this society we've constructed is meaningful, and good, and just.

My trauma specifically came about as a result of my closest friend and my wife having an affair together, and the subsequent mental breakdown of my wife, and abuse towards me. She made me fear for my life. Then emptied my bank account, isolated me from any social support, attempted to sexually assault me, and basically left me to suffer alone. Broke, homeless, and isolated.

I'm acutely aware of what it feels like to spend years building something you once felt was ""meaningful"" to only have it crumble in an instant, revealing its truth to be all an illusion, a lie. A worthless effort.

It's forced me to look deeply at myself and the world around me, and it's hard to see any real value or meaning in it.

I've always suffered from existentialist thoughts, as long as I can remember. But for a short while, I found value and meaning in Family and Friendships. And that was, ultimately, an illusion, and used against me in a vicious abuse/smear campaign.

Not sure where to go from here. But I am open to talk if you'd like to. This has been on my mind for a while, and I've found very little support for this kind of existential dread.

With mine being a quiet borderline, she only fluctuated between the The Child, and the The Lucid kind of behaviors. She did this for 5 years. So most of the time, she appeared self-aware, or someone lost and innocent, like a child. If she was raging, it must have been on the inside at herself, because she didn't rage outwardly.

Then in the final 3 weeks, she devalued me, had an affair. So she definitely rapid-cycled between all 3 very frequently, with The Raging Abuser behavior coming out daily. But then she would collapse into breif moments of Lucidity, or Child-like victimness.

BPDlovedones,fpl730n,t1_fpl3aul,1588707526.0,"Very much so.

I even had several heartfelt talks with her, where I tried very hard to understand her reasoning and behavior.

It ultimately came down to me telling her that: I accept that she wants to be polyamorous, and I am willing to love her, respect her, and support her -- but only as a friend. As a husband, that is not a life I want, and I understand we are not compatible.

She refused to accept this, and demanded I conform to her needs and ""allow her"" to have a side boyfriend, and continue to be her husband. She didn't care if I was hurt, or how I felt about the situation.

When I reiterated my boundaries, and willingness to stay by her side (as a friend only), she still denied me. She accused me of being prejudiced to her sexuality. Then she proceeded to publicly accuse me of such prejudice.

I made it very clear, several times, that I wanted to reconcile in some way and keep a friendship. But she refused that offer, and demanded my loyalty. It didn't matter how deeply, or often, I explained myself. She stuck to her own narrative.

It is insane. It can only make any sense if you look at it from the perspective of someone who:

1. Does not care about other people's boundaries, wants, or needs.
2. Is willing to hurt others (to bend others to their will).
3. Will do anything to get what they want.

Dont like being cheated on? You are prejudiced, and are oppressing her as a sexual minority. Anything you say or do now is equivalent of hate speech. Checkmate.

There are things that absolutely can be dealt with (like internal thoughts beliefs), but there are aspects that therapy can not solve (like problems due to unstable employment, physical health issues, or lack of social support).

Its been a year, and I'm finding that therapy isn't really working. I've come to the realization that, essentially, my very perception of the entire relationship was wrong. But not really through any fault of my own: my pwBPD was just very good at hiding herself. I did not expend a great effort deluding myself that it was healthy when it was clearly not, it seemed like a genuinely good relationship. I had generally firm boundaries, and I set realistic expectations, and voiced concerns as they arose.

So I haven't really ""learned"" anything from this experience. I've learned that I put my trust into the wrong person, that's true. But also, that my very perception of who is and is not trustworthy, is not really reliable -- that it can be exploited and used against me too.

I keep trying to find something that I could have done differently, some area where I could point to concretely and say ""this is where I made a mistake"" -- but I really can't find one. Nothing major or unreasonable, that is.

Nothing I did in the relationship logically led to me being sexually assaulted, exploited, cheated on, and fearing for my life. Nothing I did warranted that reaction, so there's really nothing about me that needs ""correcting"" or change, in that regard. Not anything that stands out as obvious.

But regardless, those things still happened, and now I just exist with the damage, and distrust. So now what am I supposed to do? How do you move forward, and convince yourself that human intimacy like that is a worthwhile endeavor, knowing just how horribly wrong things can go in an instant?

I've been used and cheated on before, in past relationships and friendships. It hurts for a while, but you move on.

Nothing compares to what my pwBPD did. I've never feared for my life like that, waking up in a cold sweat. I've never found someone on the kitchen floor, crying with a knife. I've never seen some oscillate between screaming at me, and pouting. I've never had someone steal every last cent I had to my name, and a use me of abusing them.

And despite coming to terms and realizing that she was always this sick, and there's nothing I could have done to help... So, what now? I've accepted that it wasn't my fault, and nothing I did could have caused or prevented what happened.

So what now? None of that changes my current situation: no money in my bank account, traumatized, can't hold a job, stuck living with my parents again, and physically deterioting health.

No one (at least those I talk to in person) seems to understand what I went through. Even my therapist, it feels like I'm just talking to a wall.

If your trauma is linked to a very specific event (such as being assaulted, or threatened) you most likely have standard PTSD. If the abuse was more subtle, or happened over a prolonged period of time, it's classified as complex PTSD.

Treatment for them is similar, but not identical.

I was always a bit skeptical of her claims, but I've also had weirdly specific dreams about future events before. So I'm not against the idea that it's possible to make very accurate predictions of the future, or get glimpses of events yet to happen.

That said, she made a grand prediction that me, her, and her affair partner would live harmoniously in some sort of triad relationship. She confided this to me, that she had seen the future, and that this was what was to come. She had such a genuine look on her face, and had written notes about it and everything. She desperately wanted me to believe her, and validate her ""prediction."" 

It was at that moment I realized just how delusional she was. It broke my heart, really. I loved her so much, and yet she was living in a fantasy. I had no desire to be a 3rd wheel in my own marriage.

I'm not sure how to process all this. If the relationship was just so-so, and ended in abuse, I think it would have been easier to process.

But really, it was the best relationship I'd ever had, and my time with her, were the best years of my life. Contrasting that to the awful abuse in the end, I don't know what to make of it.
