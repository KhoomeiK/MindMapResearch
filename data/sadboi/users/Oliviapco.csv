That’s good that you’ve accepted that honestly, I haven’t yet...I still get pissed off at them for not atleast trying to understand, but I probably need to accept that they won’t so it doesn’t bother me as much. 

Scare you off from your depression?! How is that supposed to scare you off?!! That’s honestly dumb and not the right way to deal w such problems that we have."

I guess the worse thing is when my mom found out that I was sexually abused and I told her the way I felt about it, she literally laughed and told me it wasn’t that bad and that I probably don’t even remember it and when she offered to help me end my life. 

I Would say that after that I just stopped talking to my parents after that, because the just don’t care."

I would say, to start writing a song, ask yourself these questions: “what am I thinking” or “how am I feeling”? Then ask yourself why are you thinking about that thing or feeling that way. After, take those thoughts or feelings and put them into words.

I’m still waiting over here tho. Also not to come off as rude or anything, but I’m not being fucking stupid...First, I didn’t ask to be put on this earth and I don’t want to live anymore to see what other harsh things or people will hurt me. Second, I no longer see beauty or freedom, I see a world that’s gonna get worse and cause more and more suffering. I’ve wanted to die ever since I was 8 because of what happened to me, but I didn’t know what suicide was until 11. At the ages of 12-15 I tried ignoring the fact that I was severely bullied by students, teachers, and was sexually assaulted at 6 or 8. When I turned 16 I finally couldn’t take holding it in any longer and kept thinking about suicide, but never attempted it because my parents told me it was a sinful selfish act. now I’m 17 and I’m ready to die with no hesitation...weather it be natural or by my or someone else’s hand."
depression,ezywkcg,t1_ezyqk2r,1568276044.0,"No I get what you’re trying to say. I clearly vented out of extreme anger here...but the people I told my problems to, I know everything that they’re going through at this very moment and have showed them that I cared every step of the way and I still do now. I always and I mean always will make sure I actually listen and take my time out to say something meaningful to the people I know including random strangers before I just throw my emotional baggage on them. There is no fucking way I’ll ask someone to show empathy towards me without me showing empathy towards them first. This is the reason I never told my friend how I feel, because she is going through shit at the moment and I can’t put another load on her mind, I can’t talk to my  sister because she argues with me everytime I tell her how I feel, I can’t talk to my parents because they’re going through a separation. And you know, I get it everyone is too busy and I know that nobody will ever be able to comfort and hold me while I cry or show empathy towards 
me :( But it’s something I long for instead the same words being thrown at me over and over again. I know that there are people who go through worse than me, but telling  me to suck it and be grateful because others are going through worse, makes me feel more worthless knowing that no one really cares and makes me determined to want to end myself even more."

Things happened to me when I was younger in the past, that’s the cause of my depression and I told my mom that, but she keeps saying that’s not the case. So I give up... I definitely understand that my moms trying to help, I just wish she could have done it in a more comforting way. I kinda did take her advice btw, but regardless if I do, everytime I find something I love to do it doesn’t matter because life is a never ending cycle and whatever I do I will continue to live my life doing the same things every day, week, month, and year until I die, so what’s the point. But I will say, the only thing that helps me atleast cope with it all is writing/singing my own music, I won’t say it makes me happy because I tend to write songs based off how I feel and it just ends up making me break down crying.
