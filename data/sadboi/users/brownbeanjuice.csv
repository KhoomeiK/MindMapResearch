The same people that were cheering on Clare (39) attacking   Matt (28) are the ones sitting here saying that Nick (39) attacking Madison (24) is disgusting. I don‚Äôt love Nick but he wasn‚Äôt wrong? Madison does act high and mighty while simultaneously making a fan page for herself to get famous and also using a fake house for hometowns that was much nicer than her own.
