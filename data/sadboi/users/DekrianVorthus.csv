SuicideWatch,fdry6g5,t3_emwdo0,1578691437.0,"I know how you feel, I've once come very close to doing it myself( stood near a railway hoping to jump infront of a train, but it just wouldn't come) I've thought about that moment quite alot  over the years(usually thinking i was a coward for not waiting longer). I'd say no but in reality its alot more complex"
SuicideWatch,fc5xnx6,t3_egdj4t,1577468049.0,I hope you do find that friend and if you wanna vent for a bit you can dm me anytime
SuicideWatch,fc5veug,t3_egd3bw,1577466736.0,I know the feeling. Its a horrible time to feel down on your luck hope it improoves. Maybe talk to me for a bit if you are up for it. I'm in a somewhat simular situation so i know how just needing to talk about it can help(eventhough i'm to proud to even go to a therapist)

Hey man don't stress about it,  how  long ago did you stop?  (I know this might sounds dumb) Maybe stop saying  ""recovering alcoholic"" and say that you have been recovered. I know its the common term that is used but ""recovering"" implies that its still in progress.  If you are having a hard time with it you are always welcome to send me a dm if you just need some one to vent to. I can't start to begin to think how hard it must be, i mean i know its not even close but i can't even convince myself to stop smoking even though i think about it once and a while."
SuicideWatch,evce5bc,t1_evc635k,1564413111.0,I think you missed the point i am making. Sure i might be an asshole i'm really not one to judge of that for myself. The point i was trying to convey is that people with obviously some serious problems like for instance drug/ alcohol abuse seem to have no problems finding a partner while i struggle. Either i'm an asshole as you mentioned maybe i'm invisible  in a romanic way  i just don't know. Hell atm i'd take a woman trying to take advantage of me i'd probably willingly allow it to happen just to feel something
SuicideWatch,etj6viv,t3_cbk8i7,1562867360.0,"It annoys me to no end, that you see plenty of bad/horrible ppl in relationships when no one gives me a second glance. I just sum up every person i know thats in a relationship with serious problems and it make me think am i some sort of monster? Am I worse than the alcoholic or the drug addict the one that leaves his wife while pregnant and 2 kids to go to the girl he's been cheating on her with? Apparently i must be some piece of work to make them worthy yet i'm obviously not."
SuicideWatch,etccjgv,t1_eta62nc,1562681498.0,"Honestly friends don't really matter much anymore, most are married with kids and don't have  time for me, and  honestly neither do I. I feel like i'm going to end up with some woman i don't like all that much but it was the only one that was availlable with most likley kids from another guy that will resent me for not being their father yet paying for their shit anyway, well that or end up going on a vengence massacre"
SuicideWatch,eta59jk,t1_eta45o4,1562612500.0,"I don't see any point in therapy just waisted time/money.  I'm happy with who i am it all lays with the opposite sex, behond my first gf (nearly 2 decades ago)  not a single girl/woman has even shown any sort of intrest... i've tried it all... Its asif i'm invisible, its not asif i'm ugly or fat. I'm tall in shape somewhat intelligent. Yet no intrest at all. Then you see people all around you either Alcoholics find lovers, gamblers, child abusers, murderers drug dealers you name it  all are able to find some one that loves them. Hell not even any intrest for my money. I've tried it all nothing works.. I'm certain  i'm ending up my life alone and i do not wish to do so."
SuicideWatch,eta3a4c,t1_eta20ki,1562611244.0,"I am currently in my thirties and living alone i've experienced plenty it doesn't help.. From the outside in  i'd appear like a normal guy who's owns his own home has some close friends (who all know nothing of my depression or my suicidal thoughts)  same goes for my family. I know  ""just talk to them"" argument won't do it will only drive me towards it faster in my teens years i've confined it to my GF of the time but she ended up cheating but no matter who you tell it to they don't understand they get angry after a week or 2 that you arn't fixed yet and avoid you. While they won't avoid me now i know exactly how it will go and even the eventual result will be.. me having to pretend i'm fine and happy  like i'm doing now  but have to overdo it bc they know something is/was there"

I'm running out of things to make me wait hell i wouldnt even been here if was patient that one night when i was semi drunk waiting on the train tracks in the middle of the night hoping a train might pass by"
