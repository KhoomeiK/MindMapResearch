So what's more believable? That he just went and took a swing at a cop for no reason, or that the cops gave him shit, he didn't play along with their power trip, and they escalated?

Fun thing about ""assaulting police"" is that when a cop is arresting you, even the slightest lack of compliance (either real or made up by the cop) is resisting arrest and assaulting the officer. So if you have not committed a crime but don't give the cop the level of respect they think they deserve while they are assaulting you, then just like magic you have scored an assaulting police charge, which is a really useful one for the cops and papers to make you look like a criminal thug. 

Refuse a request for a drug search? That is enough for a cop to say they had reasonable suspicion to compel you to do a strip search. Dont like it? You are now under arrest. Pull away or struggle while they are using pain compliance techniques to restrain you? Congrats - without doing anything wrong you are now a violent criminal."
