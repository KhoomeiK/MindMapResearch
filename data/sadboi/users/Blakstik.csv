NPD,exnawk2,t1_exmquaj,1566450511.0,"Thats a good read to understand more about this.  I understood what might be reasons for my situation  an knew more about this..thanks for sharing that.

I used to hurt people with my words when i was a kid sometimes. 
Now, i don't hurt them..atleast not wantedly with my words. At a point i will just stop speaking  because i know then i will just speak manipulative words , which may be triggering.. and it leads to digging things up, which is obviously nonsense thing to do.. and it blows thing up. 

I can say.. when i used to hurt people before..its because 
I wanted them to feel what i was feeling.. and i wanted to feel  soemthing..to have some feeling.  And  to make me feel good. 
Seriously, i was always empty inside.. i was always empty. I don't know why i felt that way .. i wanted to feel something.. 
I had inferiority complex too.. like i am worthless . I remember feeling  this way when i was 4 or 5.. i wanted to feel something..like i am real and talking such way to people  made me feel real, like i am normal and equal like them. I know how messed up this sounds..particularly i thought that way as a kid.. but that is what i did.. i feel bad for doing that. At that time..i did not think it might hurt people.. but now i understand..it hurts a lot. 
 And i was a closed person.. a lot things goes on in my head.. i just say some things superficially.. while people around  me used to live  in the moment.  I used to dissociate from myself and imagine things.  That was my world.where i was really alive. I had terrifying fear to speak things in fear of being punished..and i had shitty anxiety.  Stomach pains were a frequent thing to me coz of feeling anxious. 
I craved attention..i wanted a lot of attention.  It made me feel wanted and loved."

bangalore,exbyx81,t3_crx3zl,1566140577.0,"Agreed.. it is not ok to be careless about surroundings. 
And its a better idea to teach it in school.. its taught in some schools.. when i was a kid,our teachers used to say about it. But.. it would be good if its taught at home too..  that they must not harm surroundings in any way.

I saw that some of people i know only do half the work.. say they will just eat or take what and litter the wrappers..its almost a automatic thing. And i think some people feel that they are entitled to it the same way as all the people around them.  I went to other place with my relative before a long time, i had some left over food that i didn't eat in the bus.. i thought to throw it when i reach home so i was carrying the packet with me.. she saw that and asked me..i told her the same. She almost grabbed it from my hands and threw it away on the road. (Now.. that is not really ok. You can't pull things from someone's  hands without asking..that's another thing. I'm  not saying  about that).  Like .. no one gives  a second thought about it.. how does it get cleaned? 
Its always better to not create chaos than to clean it up later.

And thats true..i have also seen that no one cares to fold blankets in buses after using (neither did i honestly speaking)and to keep things in order. Idk why it didn't strike to me..that i shoud keep it properly. But, i try to not litter atleast.. i saw that littering and leaving used things in public places too.  Its almost seen as a normal thing but its really worrisome."

You don't  know if your mom is feeling  the same way now. When you sit alone with your mom.. just let her know that you care for her, you love her.. remind her the favours she has done to you in your childhood and how that you made you feel great as a kid. .and take the responsibility of your  younger siblings.. like try to understand, or to get close with them. Inshort.. take some responsibility  from her shoulders. 

 When you acknowledge them, agree with their problems, thats when they will  be open to listen to you(your advice or anyother thing).. let them completely  open up, their view about mom, etc. Thats when you can see if they are not being able to understand  something  properly . Or sometimes..it might not really  be their problem too.. unfortunately  some adults don't treat them properly  too.. try to know what they are facing. you can them let them know how much your mom is struggling.. you don't  need to say it directly (they may outright  reject it coz you told they aren't  getting  along with your mother). 
You can watch a movie related to it.. and ask them to join..that way, you will know if they are ready to watch it.. and sometimes it may work  and they may understand  really. 

And finally..if things go wrong sometimes.. don't keep things to yourself  ..share with someone.. or maintain a journal the way your mother did. Its a very good way to let out pressure.. i maintain a journal too.. Or it bottles up and becomes a serious problem.i feel  Its difficult to change  a viewpoint of a person (depends  on that person too).. i feel phyiscal work is better and a but easier to do.. when you deal with things like this mentally..it drains you mentally, makes you feel  exhausted, particularly  when you are like a mediator.

The thing is..  People can't know something.. And how it feels unless they face it themselves.  And mental health services are not that good too here (Idk about metros,  but I have seen that in small cities,  they are not good and almost non-existent in villages).  
But,  when it comes to a single person, If they see someone is making fun of mental illness, similar issues, and the people who are suffering from it.. If they confront it and say that's a serious problem which needs treatment the same way as physical illness.. That might help to some extent. But the application of this is a questionable thing.. Like..its necessary to make so many people aware about it.. And also.. the rate of people who confront others..  Is a bit less(I think).  But,  a better idea.. I think.  
It might be helpful to put it on huge hoardings on road too ( they created awarenness about HIV this way.. Before 12 or 13 years).

But, I stopped listening to some things when she used to say..  'This way.. It is not good.  It was good that way only'. I used to control myself.. Just say ' I know you like if things are done that way'.  But did the things the way I like.

I have mild memories of seeing my father once in a while ..from my childhood. He used come and go.. like he used to leave us and go away for months to his sister's house.. whenever he had  a fight with my mother. He came to live us from my 11th year. He is narcissistic .. so, things have been a bit difficult honestly, particularly to deal with abusive things when you are a kid. When he suddenly showed up at my school when I was 10, he asked me ..  'Is this the way you talk to your father? your friends talk to their fathers the same way too?' I did not know at that time.  things have been that way.. kinda abusive and in a blaming way from then.

I have certainly felt bad .. and missed his presence as a kid .. the support, comfort,  he should give me, his protection, his comfort by protecting me when someone attacks me or abuses me.

and another reason can be.. might be she might have thought many things over and felt like she might be dragging you down with her baggage. It happens. A person in a relationship might think that their partner would be better off without the baggage, particularly when the other partner don't have any issues and is perfectly healthy. If a person truly loves another person, they do this .. you know. all they want is to make you happy and she already knows she means the life to you.. which means if she is happy after you both got separated(she makes it appear like that). since you are good enough to put her happiness above yours, you feel that 'atleast she is happy now'(which you are already thinking) and it would be easier for you to move on.  This might be the reason she is making things appear that way.  Also, when you are not thinking clearly, you might do things on impulse.  I know after  being together for such  a long time and you have bonded from a  young age.. and it doesn't really sound too good to end things in a snap without discussing with each other.  

So, if she knows that the efforts she took here are not helping you and you are not really able to move on.. there might be chances for you guys to discuss things.
