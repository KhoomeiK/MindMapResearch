SuicideWatch,fmrey69,t3_fwr2nm,1586321250.0,Always. I doubt I’d a funeral ceremony because only good people get to be mourned. Plus even if there was a funeral my casket would probably be spat on and my grave danced on. When I die I only deserve a cheap trash bag and an unmarked grave.

AmItheAsshole,fguajjq,t1_fgua4un,1581116178.0,"We met when they needed an emergency babysitter. Elizabeth was pregnant with her second child and she started having contractions, but they couldn’t find anyone to babysit that time of night. We went to the same church, they gave me a call, and I agreed. 

We first bonded over geeky stuff like Doctor Who, Game of Thrones, Star Wars, etc. when we first met, Luke was a die hard Bernie supporter. Then half a year later, he says he’s pro-Trump after watching a few conservative podcasts on Youtube. Now he’s always trying to stir up a reaction out of people who are neutral or anti-Trump constantly.

Elizabeth is more chill. She tries to shut down Luke’s debates before they make social gatherings awkward or tense."

SuicideWatch,fgpvpd6,t3_ezf7z1,1581012919.0,"I’m with you on this. This sub is just full of people who will overlook posts unless it’s one they can use to make themselves look good. They’ll say the run of the mill stuff:
-You’re not alone.
-You’ve got this.
-Please don’t.
-I’m here for you.

But the moment you try to reach out, they shut you down. Or they just end the conversation if you’re not their prop to make them feel like a mental health hero. If you don’t reply to them with “You’re right! I should rethink this.” Then they’re done with you. They only reach out to make themselves feel better or look good to others. A bunch of false concern and fake love. 

There’s help for people like you and me, friend. But it’s not on Reddit. It’s not on this sub filled of false sympathizers and insincere well wishers. There’s help out there and I hope we both can find it."
SuicideWatch,fgipkmt,t3_eyomu7,1580827987.0,"Agreed. I feel like most of the time, it’s just a way to shut down a conversation and not have the burden of our feelings on their mind. They just want to end the conversation because it makes them uncomfortable. I hate it."
