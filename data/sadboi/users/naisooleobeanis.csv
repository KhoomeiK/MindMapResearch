CapitalismVSocialism,fqtla0a,t1_fqtic1n,1589641205.0,no social democrats do. communism is incompatable with western democracy. in order to have communism you must first have a people's revolution that hasn't happened in the us so anyone labeling themselves as communists and runs for office in the us is dishonest or not seeking office
CapitalismVSocialism,fqt5nw3,t1_fqt5bmj,1589630745.0,"technically you cant vote for a non capitalist party in the us as all of the communist parties here don't really operate as an electoral entity but more as a sort of vanguard. Sure you can vote if you want to but it is literally impossible for them to win. And contrary to what america tells you communism is a very diverse ideology just as you have liberals conservatives liberterians,etc. in america you have leninists, maoists,trotskyists,anarchist,syndicalists,etc in communism. How many communists are in the higher levels of us government? I'll tell you 0. Sure you might have 2 that win a local election in a town of 500 people or so but it works that way in china too(even in bigger cities they allow liberal influence such as hong kong)"
CapitalismVSocialism,fqt4t3e,t1_fqt4avd,1589629982.0,There are multiple parties allowed they're just all communist just like how in the us they're all capitalist. The reasoning for having a governing communist party is the whole principle of the dictatorship of the proleteriat. if you have liberals or nationalists in office they will be fighting against you. The goverment in ML societies is supposed to be cooperative and i'd argue that's favorable to how most other democracies work

communism101,foch39h,t3_g6ls2s,1587671260.0,"Right now I think laos and vietnam are focusing more on sort of an nep kind of thing and are trying to stay out of international affairs. They already are under a lot of strict rules by the IMF and World Bank to keep certain things privatized. That's the biggest issue I think is all these international banks and ""humanitarian aid"" organizations stop paying if you nationalize anything or go against the will of the west. So right now theyre trying to focus on building domestic industry and production so when the future comes they can have a chance of holding their ground if the west sanctions them or goes to war against them. I think what cuba is doing is a pretty ballsy move but they are highlighting the strengths of socialism when it is put up to condemnation by most major world powers. Vietnam I know is starting back on the road to communism(I could expect to see them nationalizing even more of their economy in a few years once they dont need international aid) I dont know about laos from what ive heard it's one of the poorest countries. I personally believe in the next 10 years we might even see china start to export revolution. I think if Vietnam,Cuba,Laos,DPRK, and china keep it up we can expect a ""new eastern bloc"" to form which i think the us sees too since theyre reving up their propaganda engine into overdrive"
