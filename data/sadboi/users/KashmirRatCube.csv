It certainly isn't a positive thing to say about someone, and it comes across as saying his ex having depression made her a burden. That is certainly a shitty thing to say sbout someone. 

I have no sympathy for cheaters. I, myself, have never cheated nor been cheated on. I still think people who cheat are selfish a-holes. And you cannot deny that the end of the relationship was directly caused by cheating,  which means yes it was his fault. The same as it would have been her fault had she been, say, abusive.

I have personally seen many relationships between parents and the exs of their children. Just because people aren't together anymore doesn't mean you suddenly stop loving or caring for their ex who was a part of your family. If OP'S son cannot be mature enough to understand that, that is on him."

But women shouldn't be shamed or looked down on for it. Especially considering how piss poor sex education is in much of the world. A lot of young moms got pregnant unintentionally because of lack of education or access to family planning services. Just my two cents.

Of course there are lots of young women who intentially get pregnant young instead of it being an accident. The choice seems very poorly thought out (how will you finish your education? Or get a decent paying job to provide for a child? Etc). I cannot speak for why they think it is a good idea."

Maybe he is insecure. Maybe he is a narcissist. Who knows. What I do know, and can tell you from experience, is that his behavior won't change. It will continue to get worse.

My ex started out like yours. Just little comments here and there. And he was always SO SORRY after. In fact he would be so remorseful that he would cry and I would have to put my feelings aside to comfort him. If I ever brought up what he said he would get super angry instantly. It was all to make me avoid calling him out or addressing his behavior. He always had an excuse. Then he started outright blaming me. I was being too sensitive. I was misinterpreting his tone. I was remembering wrong. It continued to get worse. I took it because he had me convinced I was lucky to have him and he loved me SO MUCH. It finally came to a point, after several years, where I decided to stand up for myself. His response was to try to break my arm and to try to kill me by strangling me. I called the cops. He called his family crying and saying I was the one who abused him and was making false accustations. It was ugly. The courts did nothing.

He couldn't take care of himself and was sick and vulnerable. She didn't want to leave him alone like that. To me, that is understandable.

I do agree, though, that Tifa 100% should have said something early on about Cloud. I think Cloud represented the last of her childhood.

AskWomen,flzxd9w,t3_fs60z5,1585636702.0,You are fat and diabetic because you have no self control and constantly make excuses. You eat unhealthy food and then claim it is okay because your doctor told you everything is okay in moderation. Except your version of moderation is just continually rotating through unhealthy foods. And when you get pissy and bitchy if other people are successful at weight loss you have no one to blame but yourself.

MakeupAddiction,flzmibv,t3_fs0qw0,1585627375.0,"You have beautiful eyes, I would suggest trying a variety of eye looks and colors to see what you feel best in. You would look killer with a cat eye, or other graphic liner looks. Your natural lip shape is lovely, you could tone down the over lining a little bit and accentuate the natural shape more.

It all depends on the look you want to go for. What women do you find beautiful? What drag queens do you like the look of. Finding your signature look is all about finding what makes you feel the most powerful snd beautiful."
