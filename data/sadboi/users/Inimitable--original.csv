relationship_advice,ers429z,t3_c3le7z,1561198738.0,This is honestly terrifying. As someone with terrible insomnia I understand how abnormal that is to just instantly fall and stay asleep. This gives me bad feelings just because it seems so improbable that your insomnia would magically go away. Personally I would also be freaked out. I wouldn't ask him because if he happens to actually be driving you there's no telling what he would do if he find out that you knew. I would probably try the camera method or pretending to be asleep so you have some evidence. I really hope that all turns out well for you.

AskReddit,er75g0m,t3_c0ijuy,1560567589.0,"Not a teacher but something that happened when I was a student  This will become evident, but I went to a very small school in rural Iowa. So basically- it was trapping season, meaning all the boys would go out before school and set their traps and kill whatever was in their traps. This culminated in the great dead racoon wars of 2014. It started out with people putting dead racoons on other people's cars. Then it was in the cars. The final straw was when the dead racoons were brought inside and hid throughout the school. It took me telling this story to friends at college for me to realize that this was NOT a normal highschool experience."
BPD,er70jhy,t3_c0rsga,1560563115.0,"No advice really. My fp was toxic af and it took him replacing me while I was in the hospital for three days for a suicide attempt for me to finally get rid of him. He was an abusive friend who only cared about me if we were getting high or I was sucking his dick. So I guess my advice is find a fp that's better than that! Also since getting out of my obsession with making him care about me, when he was incapable of caring for anyone but himself, has been so good for me. So good luck to you!"

It took a lot of very bad life events happening at once and a lot of transition to make me finally stop. I don't have a good answer as to how to stop, but I can tell you I feel SO FREE since quitting. My day is no longer consumed by getting high. I actually do things I need and want to do.

It's already so hard for me to trust people and now I've lost all trust in the people I was closest to. I can't stop thinking about everything and I feel like I'm the one who fucked up even though they hurt me.

It's been weird since quitting because I now have about 10 more hours of free time that I have to use instead of smoking it away. I've tried to just take it easy. I've been letting myself be lazy without smoking. I'm starting to try to get back into old hobbies that weed stole from me and to try new things.

The first week was really hard because my mental health was so bad because of weed, and I lost the ability to self medicate through weed. But then my life started getting brighter again. I felt happier and healthier than I had in years. So it does get better. Trust me, there are still hard times, but I find myself reaching to self care now, instead of self destruction via weed.
