This was an upgrade to my build, I bought a i9-9900k, new motherboard to house it, and a H100I RGB Platinum Pro. I install it all, connect everything. Do a double check of everything so no mishaps can be made, check manuals about fan header locations. Good to go, fire my rig up, instantly no fan movement on my radiator and no RGB. Boot into BIOS at error screen, the pump isn't even detected. While trying to figure it out my CPU temp monitor displayed 87°C and 106°C as I scrambled to shut the rig down. I quickly grabbed my friend's cooler and installed it, and sure enough no POST. Dead i9-9900k because a faulty pump. I'm not alone on that one apparently. Many people had their processors cooked. So here I am. No gaming pc. Corsair refusing to even help or RMA. Guess I'll be selling what's not destroyed."

BreakUp,fofco4p,t3_g70ozi,1587732803.0,"I'm so sorry you were treated that way brother. I had a similar situation, but trust me I'm much more stupid for staying with her, I dated this girl for 3 years. 
I used to bowl on a league, and it was my friends sister. She would occasionally come to the league days, and I always thought she was super pretty, and friendly. She would flirt off and on, and my friend even talked to me privately about saying how I was the right guy for her, and he thought I should make the move, so I asked her out for a date, and we had a fantastic time, and she grabbed my hand and I asked her to be my girlfriend. From that day forward we had a solid year of the best relationship I ever had and will ever have. I couldn't believe it, and I guess it was too good to be true. She would do things for me that I loved and appreciated, she surprised me on my birthday, surprised me showing up to my cross country meets and state bowling leagues, my parents loved her and always wanted her over for dinner and such. Well about 1 year and 2 months into our relationship, she cheated on me with guy #1. I didn't find out until on on our 2 year anniversary, fate would have it and she saw the guy in public, and tried to lead me away but he followed her berating her for dating me. She came clean and told me everything. I felt so hurt, but I had really loved her, so I hugged her tight and apologized for not being better. From that day I tried to do everything better. She cheated on me again with guy #2. I tried changing again. By our 3 year anniversary, she had slept with the #3, #4, and #5 guy, and when I came to get my things from her house like my sweatshirts and stuff she started to assault me, then beg me to stay. I cut my losses and just left, she sent me videos of her burning all my sweatshirts, and a blanket my grandma had made me. She burnt it all laughing. I blocked her and spiraled down a really dark parth. I've been broken. Depressed since it all happened. I lost my friend because he said I had betrayed his sister. I see her parents and little cousins that had loved me and they give me a cold look and it kills me. I just want to die. Its been 5 years and I've tried moving on, but I cannot get a girlfriend, no one talks to me, and I think that I'll probably just be alone for the rest of my miserable existence."

I am not a doctor or licensed professional, so take what I say with discretion. If you break out in Fever, do not take Tylenol, Advil, or Ibuprofen. The virus is weakened by heat, and your body will fever to try and fight it. Drink lots of water, and Gatorade. Keeping your electrolyte levels up is crucial to your survival, just as staying hydrated is. Eat healthy meals filled with protein and vitamins. Wear layers of clothes or cover up in blankets to keep your body temperature up, if you can soldier through 100-103 degree fever, do it. Take long hot showers regularly and take deep breaths while in the shower. The water vapor will help decongest your lungs of flem buildup, and prevent pneumonia. Breath into a cold wet rag regularly, as this will also help your lungs. Try to include basic movement in your day as well to keep blood circulation up, and stretch often. If you feel it is becoming unbearable, seek immediate medical help. I hope these things can help you."
