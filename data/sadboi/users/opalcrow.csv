Hypothyroidism,fq6wahp,t1_fq42gso,1589138663.0,It is hard to research anything these days. We live in a world of misinformation. Thanks. Will do.
Hypothyroidism,fq6vtkn,t1_fq49fa6,1589138492.0,I did keto prior to getting pregnant. I lost 60 pounds in 6 months on it and felt great. It is something I do want go back to eventually when I have more time for it.

Hypothyroidism,fq0ohdw,t1_fpxqji4,1589035138.0,Follow up question..what do you guys eat? I am just starting to research and it seems EVERYTHING is bad for hypothyroidism.
Hypothyroidism,fq0fr5y,t1_fpxso57,1589031176.0,Wow. I didn't even know that thyroid surgeries were a thing until very recently. It seems pretty scary honestly.

AmItheAsshole,fkfulih,t3_fi3pp2,1584142903.0,NTA I would ask her how she would feel if you brought a bale of hay or horse dander in the house every time she stepped out. If she is so allergic she should be able to see things from your point of view. Your roommate is an asshole.
beyondthebump,fjj0ofk,t3_fddrvl,1583380261.0,It is my understanding that when baby starts rolling you can no longer use the wings on the swaddle up. We went to zipadee zips and my lo loves it.

beyondthebump,fi5wi28,t3_f6b92y,1582172174.0,My family knows I am against putting my baby on social media. The only thing I allow is a closed family group and they know to ask permission first.
beyondthebump,fhw5ypr,t1_fhuciiu,1581907209.0,We use the huckleberry app as well and it is a  life saver. We ordered a white noise machine online that was not specifically marketed to babies. We turn it off when it is time to wake up and on during sleep times. It seems to help my lo associate that noise with sleep. This may not work for you but it is what worked for us.

beyondthebump,fdhsmn1,t3_ekvt9i,1578429398.0,I had to stop tracking my sleep with Fitbit. Seeing exactly how much sleep you are (not) getting on the screen was utterly depressing
beyondthebump,fdhrs4b,t3_el9uod,1578428914.0,If something  doesn't  feel right then always trust your gut. I would rather be that parent than regret it if something  happens. You don't  have to make a scene but I would shop other places then switch them to the better daycare. They will not care as much as you think and it will  put your mind at ease.

books,f029ird,t3_d36lzm,1568326185.0,"Pertaining to the library bit...As a librarian in a library that did this I will say it is a lot of work and a little money involved. We completely redid every spine label in the fiction section adding author, series, and series number. We had to go into the bib records and change it to match in the system as well so that both librarians and card catalog users could see that information digitally. Most libraries have to order through Demco company which marks up their supplies quite a bit.  This plus the man hours taking each book off the shelf and reprocessing it is more than most libraries want to deal with. The end result? Worth it! It was so easy to find the book a person wanted and the public loved it. A good website that will tell you series order in a straight forward way is fantasticfiction.com (have worked in several libraries. Most libraries use this)"
beyondthebump,ewp7ybw,t3_cpewp5,1565635402.0,Our LO would cry every moment she was awake. I tried BF and switched to gentle formulas but it was no different.  She Doctors kept telling us our lo was just colicky. We kept pushing the issue and it turned out she was allergic to milk. They can run a test with soiled diaper. The doctor came back in and told us he was going to take the two samples of formula for colicky babies back because it would do no good. Um thanks? The point is that if you think something isn't right then push the issue in a polite but firm way.
beyondthebump,ewkm7kw,t3_codl00,1565488213.0,"I wrote down our schedule and put it on the nursery door that way if she is cranky and we can look at the schedule and say ""ohh she is used to napping right now and I bet thats why she is cranky."" It really helps out both of us and he gets an idea of what kind of routine we are in"
NewParents,evvhcfu,t3_cl7ayy,1564836887.0,My husband and i did the shift thing. We would take turns taking care of the baby for a whole night. That way we each got a full nights sleep every other day. It really gives you something to look forward to.
NewParents,euaf8ne,t1_eu7lqkx,1563615426.0,Don't forget to cut out soy as well. I believe it takes 3 weeks to get out of your system. My baby is allergic to milk and the doctors said it is a protein found in milk and soy. We had to put her on hypoallergenic formula. Next time you go to the doctor take a fresh poop diaper and they can test it for this allergy.

beyondthebump,etq6ub6,t3_ccvjpz,1563074450.0,Yes! I absolutely hate it.  I got the summer cozy cover and always put in over my daughter when we are out. It keeps people from trying to touch her and it has a pull down shade. I don't trust anyone. People are nuts.
