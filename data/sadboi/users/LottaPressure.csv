AskReddit,fpj3cuj,t1_fpihn5w,1588655438.0,"Damn, this just happened to me. My mom tends to keep talking, get off topic, remember something else she was mad at me about, get even angrier, talk even more. She also cannot. Lose. An. Argument. So if you try to provide a counter argument it will just add another 2 hours to the conversation. It got to the point where most of our conversations/arguments were about how badly we communicated, I even call those conversations “stagnant” because they just feel dead and stuck and hopeless. I have been stuck in our parked car in the garage multiple times for around 3 hours just listening to her rants. I know she is just trying to help me with the situation im in but it gets to the point where I dread even speaking to her because I know how long and tiring those arguments can be and I don’t know what will spark the next one.

We have tried every way of organizing a conversation to not get in a fight. Writing questions on paper, responding on paper, holding a pillow to signify who can speak, planning when to have conversations, taking notes. She used to keep all her papers about me in a pink binder with a prayer written on the front. It included her questions, my responses, her notes, random articles on depression and troubled kids, and my measurements back when she would weigh and measure me each week (I was not anorexic, just overweight. But I did develop an eating disorder after this). I know she loves me. I know she is just trying to help. But why does it just make things worse?

Today, after a tough lunch conversation, she mentioned she had some questions about my treatment so I asked what they were but she wouldn’t say. I told her to ask me at 9pm as that is the time she designated to speak each night. 9pm rolls around and she doesn’t have the questions written down but she has a paper to write notes on. Cool. I ask her what questions she has about treatment and she starts out fine, treatment oriented questions. But she starts veering off topic and I, scared this will turn into another stagnant conversation, remind her that we were talking about my treatment, not my academics. Idk if it was my tone of voice (I am always on edge when I have conversations with her) but something set her off. I tried to explain that I would respond her question but that I really wanted to stay on topic. But she gave up, got up from the table, and wished me luck with my recovery. She said she couldn’t take this abuse from me. 

I have noticed that I have been a lot more bitter lately and I hate it. Even my dad has mentioned it. He’s trying to help me stick to a routine, even trying to wake me up at 9am so that I don’t oversleep. That’s really kind of him. We had a conversation about showing love through actions two mornings ago, when I was still half asleep. I’m pretty sure he was nervous about talking to me so that’s why he did it so early. I was still in bed, trying hard to keep my eyes open, and he was stroking my hair and face like he does when he wakes me up. He mentioned that he used to get annoyed to do work, be it his job or just house work. This made him a pretty bitter person (which I remember clearly). But then he changed after he had a conversation with a nun (coincidentally, the nun I was named after) about how she worked so hard for people that rarely showed her any appreciation. She explained to him what he explained to me which was that the intention was not to feel good or get praise but to show god and those people that she loved them. He then turned to me and said “you know... I mean.... she’s catholic but... it doesn’t have to be god... “ which surprised me because I didn’t know he knew I was questioning my faith. He continued to talk about how that struck him and how he changed the way he looked at work. He admitted he’s never been super sentimental but that the work he does is to show that he loves us. The work he does in his job is to show appreciation to the company that has given so much to us (it brought us to the US). Thinking through his actions this way made him a lot less annoyed by menial tasks and a lot less bitter along the way (which I remember clearly as well, in a year he stopped having angry outbursts). I will never forget that conversation, and it only lasted 10 minutes."

I love the leading lines that the train creates, this image would be great for a masterclass on perspective. But the running man seems to cut off part of the line of the train, which is mildly infuriating...

I usually don't heavily filter my images, but it was necessary in this image so that the paint colors popped out. Did I do a good job on that, or is it off-putting?

Also, composition. The eye seems like it's in an awkward position, but I don't want to crop the image in a way that loses the beautiful red line on the top of the elephant's head, nor do I want the eye to be at the center of the image. 

I tried to balance the detail of the eye with the lightness of the trunk but I don't know if that type of ""balancing"" works on anyone else's eyes but mine... So, is the light trunk distracting from the elephant's eye or does it give it a nice contrast?"

Idk, I have another picture that is similar to this one but it is of fishing boat swarmed by birds, I feel like that one may be a more interesting picture but I am still ambivalent about the dull colors around the boat."
