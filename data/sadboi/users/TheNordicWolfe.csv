That sounds so much better. With the sequel coming out, it only just confirms another big translation issue as Ganondorf is clearly not finished and was never finished. We thought we killed him but we didn't. He's been slowly doing what he could to gain his power back. Hyrule is in for a hot disaster again. 

Thanks for letting me know. I might try and work some fans who know Japanese and English and work on roughly translating the game and making sure there are no more errors but I feel like it's been since 2017 so we've likely found all of the translation errors and disservice."
botw,flohp5p,t1_flnvh4x,1585338515.0,"Definitely should have been written in Link's perspective like in the Japanese version of the game. The use of second person really takes away from the experience and I feel like I've been robbed. Third person is iffy, but if first person didn't exist then I'd definitely take it over second person! 

When interpreting for clients, I have to generally refer to myself as the client (in first person) even though I'm not the client. I don't say ""He has a funny joke"" I will say ""I have a funny joke!"" (Bad example but nonetheless it's an example.)

A book written in Spanish and translated into English won't change the perspective and pronouns, or at least it isn't suppose to unless absolutely necessary, or generally because of censorship. 

It's just so so soooooo much better to have first person in games like this, in my opinion. Especially from a character who doesn't have a lot of facial expressions, at least in some games.

I hope that in Breath of the Wild 2 we don't encounter the same disservice when it comes to the adventure log or whatever mechanic they will be using. I know Zelda took the slate after Link returned it to her, so that might change the situation, but it should be the same version and content as the original version of the game, the Japan version. If it's in her POV or whoever will have it and acts as a journal, then it should for the other versions of the game too. 

Translation and interpreting can be rough and spotty at times, but if you're trained and educated properly it shouldn't be such a struggle, or at least if they do, fix it. Which they never did. We want to provide everyone with the same information."

AskReddit,f453ehx,t3_djabmx,1571365111.0,"One time, during a holiday, we were at my grandmas like always celebrating. That night, when things settle down my cousin (whom we'll call Annie) and her half sister (fake name) Tina tell me that I should drink a little bit of alcohol before my 21st birthday, because they don't want me to feel peer pressured to drink when that time comes and we hold a 21st  birthday party for me. So I agree, sort of reluctantly. We go to her house after picking up this bottle of liquor from the store and decide to pour a shot of it into smoothies. They love doing that sort of stuff and hoped it would help me feel better drinking alcohol. 

Of course, unlike their drinks they don't put a lot of alchol into my smoothie. Not even an entire shot. We sit down at the dining room table, eating fast food or whatever and drinking our drinks, or at least Annie and Tina were. The entire time they drank their smoothies and I worked up the courage to sip mine Tina had her phone ready to record me and share it on snapchat. It made me so upset, so the entire time she was there I never took a sip. 

After Tina left a few hours later after we ate and she had some of her smoothie, she didn't finish it at all. Annie kept telling me it would be fine to take a sip, but I didn't have to...

I think its partially because of that. I felt pressured and weird, it was immature and not a fun time. However, I have had a sip or two on accident before I was even a teen. My stepfather made his own wine and he left it out in a regular old cup, and I 5hought it was my soda, drank it, and immediately spit it out and even had some come out of my nose from the sheer shock of the bitter taste. I had a taste of campaign once, hated it, and that's about it. 

After my 21st birthday I tried to have a few drinks but i can't even drink past the neck of the bottle. 

I think it's just very unappealing to me. Maybe I'll try some wines one day, or fruity smoothie drinks at a restaurant, but for now I'm good. I sort of worry about heartburn too, because my medicine gives me heartburn as a side effect, so I don't need that to trigger it."
AskReddit,f4526zq,t3_dj4nl0,1571364240.0,"I'm not a trucker but I have a story from my cousin...

We live in Pennsylvania near the Keystone Restuarant and Truck Stop, but this happened about a few miles away more in town. She was on her way home from class, and she was first in line at the traffic light. It turns Green. She starts to press her foot on the gas pedal so she can go, and out of nowhere, a semi truck comes barreling through a red light. 

He almost killed her. If she had gone just a little faster, or if he had been there a mere few seconds before, he would've hit her going from the drivers side and likely killed her on impact. 

Seconds later, a police car came from somewhere and chased the trucker down. Unsure of why he was speeding through a 45 mph area with four traffic lights in general, but he did it anyway. He may have been drunk or just an idiot driver who thought he could make it through a late yellow light, but regardless, it was a shit your pants moment no doubt. 

Her father, an emergency responder and firefighter, told her to wait just a few seconds and make sure no one is still going through before you go on a green light. I follow that advice to the best of my ability. So does she.

Not to mention, since our area does a lot of coal mining we have a lot of coal truck accidents. I am terrified of coal trucks. I have passed by too many by the side memorials for people who have been hit by coal truckers. One exit we have is littered in traffic lights and caution signs because it's a common area for coal truck accidents. I wish they would do that more, because some areas it should be illegal to drive coal trucks on. Super dangerous. My dad said his coworkers plan their routes and scope them out because they're worried they'll get into a bad place and wreck. 

Needless to say, we aren't big fans of semi trucks and tractor trailers in general. Down here we get truckers who are just plain rude. So, honestly, I love whenever I hear stories about responsible drivers who do their best and air on the side of caution, follow the rules, etc. I avoid passing trucks on highways and I always keep a good distance from them if I can. I just feel super uncomfortable and I hate it when they pass you. I can literally feel the car being blown over by the wind to the side of the road when they do..."

Now this...

Suzy we are here for you. Please take all the time you need and don't let someone rush you during this time of grief. I know lots of people pressure others to get over it, but don't let them. We love you Suzy. We are so sorry for your loss. 

Sending my condolences to Suzy and loved ones."
unpopularopinion,f44wny6,t3_djdyte,1571360501.0,"To be honest, this is not surprising. But I do like what you did there. Smart experiment. 

People are gender bias. My stepfather was told to suck it up when his wife kept beating him to the point he wanted to commit suicide [keep in mind this was a babyboomer generation] and then my aunt was told to get the fuck out of her relationship with her verbally abusive husband asap.

It's something we teach normally without even realizing."

Poor bard, I want to hug them."

unpopularopinion,f33w5sw,t3_dfdmng,1570646414.0,"I'm going to be honest and say I've never seen anyone claim that. 

I think I've seen a few countries like Japan refer to those things, such as freedom, as being a ""western culture"" more then I've seen people say they're embracing American values who are American...

It's perspective and how people relate one thing to another...

Freedom costs something. It isn't free. Also, freedom is subjective. What does it mean to be free? Everyone has a different opinion. Idk...just my thoughts, but that's from what I've seen."
Wellthatsucks,f30loa7,t3_df1amp,1570557102.0,Oh gosh I thought it was gonna swoop over and hit him in the head or back. That would've been so much worse. I've heard that happens to people a lot though.
Wellthatsucks,f30klqe,t3_deyik5,1570556436.0,"That's super sad. What's your country? And what healthcare if anything? I'd be so upset I'd be sick. I went in an ambulance once and the expenses were horrific. We had a lot of medical distress for 5 years because of an issue with my stepfather and his brain damage but it wasn't fun. I feel this and it hurts like heck. 

I dream for healthcare to be more affordable. I don't care if it's more taxes where I live, if someone gets hit by a car I'd rather they recover and have therapy then have to add onto the stress of medicine and physical therapy, etc., bills."

I'm sure if I had a lover and they had them but I knew who they were and their personality it would be different but otherwise, idk. Seems...disturbing."
unpopularopinion,f30k7t5,t1_f2zcu8x,1570556193.0,Agree
unpopularopinion,f2m4brm,t1_f2lt7lu,1570301536.0,"Yeah, that's ok. Sorry about the communication. 

My professor got attacked by a dog a few weeks ago and had to go to the ER. Not a single interpreter was called in, and the doctor was speaking way too fast and afterwards when my prof told the Dr. that he was Deaf, the doctor spoke so slow and emphasized his words, which is INCREDIBLY offensive and a big no no. So I've been sort of upset about it and made the post and it encouraged me to make sure people are aware of the neglect in the community of Deaf and HoH. Of course, groups like Mexican Americans and other foreigners or non native English speakers are neglected and abused too."
unpopularopinion,f2ltlqe,t1_f23dww1,1570298161.0,"Usually when it comes to that, it's because most online videos are people who are not teachers, even if they were born Deaf or Hard of Hearing and used ASL since the very beginning. I've had teachers of ASL who were Hearing and when I went to college the professor was Deaf, and we have a no-voice zone in our class and mostly EVERYTHING was different. ASL can be very personal, you can use initialized signs (such as people, or party, or interview.) or other signs. There is signs for social media like Facebook or Snap Chat, and I've seen different variations of it. 

In general, you learn better when someone has the education to teach the language and when you immerse yourself into it by not using your native tongue. 

Just because I speak English doesn't mean I can just go onto YouTube and teach it willy-nilly. Of course, you'd get a good idea of it, but I'm not a teacher so it wouldn't be the best source of learning the language."
unpopularopinion,f2lsxtj,t1_f22j7gn,1570297923.0,"I don't disagree. I think learning a language, no matter what it is, is important and an enriching experience! I know around 63.2 million people in the US are not native English speakers, and I know that especially with the political events occurring now, that those minorities are neglected and abused by groups such as law enforcement. I think most people realize that, however.

But not a lot of people are aware about the Deaf culture. And lots of people think ASL is universal, or just a language of using your hands. 

I think sign language should be included in the languages offered at schools, at least optional."
unpopularopinion,f2ls6w0,t1_f20ru1h,1570297706.0,"The common core curriculum is already doing that, pal. 

They have mandatory classes that sometimes don't even help them. A friend of mine took college credit courses in HS and was told she could avoid those classes in the college she chose, it turned out to be a waste of time because she had to pay for said classes already despite the material being the same and the fact she was able to use her old notes. 

If teachers would hop onto the train of teaching students in engaging ways, it wouldn't be so bad. But lots of teachers just lecture, lecture, lecture, and have you take notes. It's rare to find hands-on teaching teachers until recently."
unpopularopinion,f2lrgsz,t1_f22b484,1570297557.0,"Yes, it depends on where you went to school and what country. Not to say that verbal languages aren't useful, I think they're all important and learning a language, be verbal or by hands/facial expressions/body posture, is an enriching experience!"
unpopularopinion,f2lrb3v,t1_f21ekzl,1570297510.0,"Or that, too. I understand the curriculum and budget of schools can make these hard to do. If not a requirement, at least an extracurricular activity!"
unpopularopinion,f2lr7bo,t1_f2lr1wm,1570297474.0,"Also, lots of Deaf people end up handcuffed with their hands behind their back, which is a big NO! They need to communicate with you be it writing on a notepad, or signing."
unpopularopinion,f2lr1wm,t1_f20r3i9,1570297437.0,"Yes, that's true. However, my Deaf professor grew up lip-reading and speaking. He did not learn ASL until he went to college and met his wife, who was also Deaf. Their two children are Hearing. 

When he got attacked by a dog last Monday, he went to the ER and the doctor and nurse kept speaking to him, but he was unable to understand them and he had to tell them that he is Deaf. No interpreter was called in, and I don't think he was even given a notepad. Whenever he speaks, he prefers for others not to hear him, except for those who are directly talking to him. The school plans to hire a full-term Interpreter because of it. 

However, a lot of staff have learned some ASL to communicate to him in his preferred ways."
