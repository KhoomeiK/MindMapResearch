eczema,fpgvzyv,t3_gcs0i0,1588610507.0,"Omg I know everyone is saying this but PLEASE LISTEN! My childhood eczema came back last year and I was dying after a shower! I would get terrible itching and burning for up to an hour after each shower, and it only got worse until I caved in and started to take cold showers. Lukewarm is NOT ok, it also still dries out the skin, also I would check your skincare products and make sure that they are sensitive (or have harmful dyes) they could worsen your eczema overtime as well. Sorry for the rant, just don’t want to see this happen to anyone else!"
eczema,fpgvgk6,t3_gd2w75,1588610233.0,Good luck!
eczema,fpgvd1u,t3_gde7pm,1588610185.0,This is such a huge cliche and may not work for you but I just do my best to keep my mind off of it and remember that this is not my whole life and that it doesn’t have control over me. I distract myself woth the things I love to do and the people I love (which during quarantine has been a little harder) and I exercise when I can. I hope this gave you a few ideas for how you can try to stay positive even during these weird times! ❤️

Clarinet,ffyilti,t3_evx27i,1580347297.0,"Hi I’m a freshman Music Ed major and I recently purchased the Vandoren black diamond ebonite 13 series mouthpiece to try and get a deeper/richer/fuller sound. However, as I was going to put my reed on my mouthpiece, I realized that it was too small! I’ve had this happen before so I tried another reed and both were too small (in the included video)! I play on Vandoren V12 size 4 reeds so there’s shouldn’t be a brand issue so I am very confused as to what the problem might be? Please help!"

Clarinet,fdltpy2,t1_fdlt3k4,1578532270.0,This has just come up the last two days I have been practicing
Clarinet,fdlp68r,t1_fdloj8w,1578529179.0,Ok thank you!
Clarinet,fd4tc3p,t1_fd3bgfk,1578170881.0,Yea! That’s exactly it for me I think! I would love to play bass clarinet in a small ensemble! Fingers crossed I get accepted 🙂
Clarinet,fd1jd07,t1_fd0802p,1578132038.0,"Yea no I feel that 110%! It’s really scary at first because they are so expensive but that’s why it’s just impotent time educate yourself and make sure you know how to properly hold it, sit it down, put it together, etc. and you  should be alright! 💛🙂"
Clarinet,fd1j14s,t1_fczvzwn,1578131910.0,"Omg I just checked them out and I am obsessed! I love Danse Macabre and I think they do a great job (and the costumes are a plus), thanks for the recommendation 💛😆"

Clarinet,fczmrvj,t1_fczkoz7,1578104634.0,"On a basic level I really like the tone of bass clarinet and sometimes that‘s the sound I want to make at that time. 
 

On a deeper, personal level I sometimes don’t feel good enough on Bb and I feel this intense pressure to be so good and perfect and playing Bass clarinet I don’t have that strict expectation for my playing and it allows me to have more fun and enjoy playing again 🙂💛"
Clarinet,fczhpf6,t1_fczc8e4,1578101499.0,"It’s the Buffet R13 Greenline Bass! That’s crazy that you own one, I’m gonna do my best to save up for one but they’re so expensive!"
Clarinet,fczhjw4,t1_fczd89f,1578101399.0,Honestly? I’m definitely getting the same way!
Clarinet,fczhicp,t1_fczaqsr,1578101373.0,"In my opinion, solo bass clarinet is beautiful as well! I’ve been recently introduced into Jazz bass clarinet (which there are solos for oddly enough) which I never would have thought to look into! (Also I just checked out moon hooch and i has no idea contrabass dubsstep was a thing and it sounds so awesome)"
Clarinet,fczaiqe,t1_fcz8ou4,1578096998.0,"Bass clarinet is literally the best! I didn’t have the opportunity to play it in high school but once I entered college, they placed me on it for one piece and I have loved it since! It’s so fun and I feel like it offers a unique sound to the ensemble 😋💛"
SHINee,fc6m81b,t3_ega6z0,1577483888.0,"...wait, we’ve been getting a lot of SHINee covers lately, does that mean that SHINee is an old group now? Does that mean I too am getting old? 🤭😅"

mentalhealth,fbubt0z,t3_eek2j1,1577111598.0,"I get the same way but I’ve learned that it’s really only bad if I’m around a group of about more than four. And It also depends on how close the friends are and how much I trust them. Family gatherings always drain me though no matter how close we are (with the exception of my brother). I personally I had to try experimenting with the different variables of social gatherings to help with the drained feeling. 

Hope this helps!"
mentalhealth,fbityy3,t1_fbitva8,1576914157.0,Yes! That’s it! How do you manage that?

superjunior,eu7qudq,t3_cf174f,1563540468.0,"I think it’s a little bit of both. He does wear a lot of baggy tops and pants with loose bottoms which do swallow him a little and that could be a fashion thing but also, he looks smaller as well."
SHINee,es2x0eq,t3_c5ggla,1561545070.0,Yes! Agreed!
SHINee,erm0e83,t1_erjrz8t,1561002004.0,There actually is a chat if you’re into discord. The SHINee discord link is on this Reddit and you can use it to join the Jonghyun server. There are multiple places to have it there and it really helped me heal. Also my good friend Kimmie is an amazing source. She’s an amazing listener and has been a Shawol for 9 years. She’s open to talking about him anytime. (She can be reached my message hear at thats_nono)
