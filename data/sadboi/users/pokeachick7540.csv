mentalhealth,fq8fxjv,t3_gh5k0z,1589165304.0,I hate Mother’s Day. No one else ever seems to get it. “She’s your mother! She gave you life” yeah she also gave me ptsd and pretty bad emotional abuse.... sooo no. I’m not calling her today.
abusesurvivors,fpx80ox,t3_gg14ve,1588977442.0, Congratulations! I’m happy for you!
SingleDads,fp9b69n,t3_g2u1j8,1588421029.0,"Well for one: i was raised by a single father (my mother was a deadbeat and left and never came back) but honestly? My dad was so amazing that I honestly didn’t know any better. I never felt left out or anything. I had my aunts when i needed girl advice or I’d go to my best friends mom. I never gave it a second thought. 
I actually buy gifts for my dad for Mother’s Day (i recently bought a mug that says “happy Mother’s Day dad! (Because shes a useless t**t)” since I’m 28 i get a lot of gag gifts for him on Mother’s Day. 
You’ll be great."
PCOS,fotmwhh,t1_foq7h6x,1588058994.0,Oh wow thank you for that information! I have an appointment in June I’ll have to bring that up.
offmychest,fmwysg4,t3_fx62g9,1586455414.0,"People need to calm down. 
I get it that it sucks having to stay inside and not being able to do fun activities sucks. Trust me, I’ve been panicking too but not for the reasons the people on my Facebook are and it’s driving me INSANE. Every day they are posting about “MARSHALLS” Law saying how we will never be able to have family gatherings ever again and how the government never wants us to have freedom again and this is just the start of the government controlling us. I get it. People are scared but come on can’t they hear how ridiculous they sound? I’ve deleted the social media apps for now. I’m so sick of hearing about everyone saying that we lost all our freedoms and we’ll never be outside again...... and it’s Martial Law......"
dogs,fme029a,t3_fu7pui,1585983935.0,The girl i got my cats from was getting so harshly shamed for needing to rehome them. But she got a promotion and wasn’t able to be home with them. She spent maybe 1 hour with before having to go to bed and she had to start traveling for her new position. People were so mean to her about it. But I’m glad she gave them up. They get so much attention here and play time. They both have behavioral issues but it’s getting better. I wouldn’t trade them for anything.

depression,fmdxbqe,t3_fuiaeg,1585981075.0,"Man this hit home. My grandmother who raised me use to talk major crap about me behind my back. I use to do everything in that house. But when my depression would hit i couldn’t do anything. She would tell people that i never did anything and that i was just a lazy bitch who hated her because i wouldn’t spend any time with her. 

I actually finally moved out. It’s been beautiful since. Hang in there. They probably won’t change but there will be a day when you can leave. It will happen. :)"

AnimalCrossing,fl5gext,t3_fmq691,1584836113.0,"The time barrier is awful for sure! 
I agree it’s getting boring. Everything is “happening tomorrow” then tomorrow happens and i finish everything in like 2 hours. Just been fishing, catching bugs and collecting wood and rocks. I travel too, i just hope the pace kicks up a little."
Anxiety,fl015c7,t3_flqg42,1584687355.0,I’m so anxious too! But I’m an extrovert and being actively social helps my anxiety. :( ugh
CatAdvice,fkjvrpr,t1_fkjtn2s,1584261920.0,"They definitely shouldn’t be bored. I play usually 45-hour with each or separately multiple times a day. I’m home a lot so i have the time. While I’m cooking, sleeping at night, or any time we leave the house it gets so bad. It’s like they need 100% attention 24/7"

I tried the foil but i don’t think i laid it right and it didn’t work lol"
offmychest,fk8h0ay,t3_fgx1ww,1583955865.0,"This! I was told i will never a fulfilled life without a child and i was asked who do i think will take care of me when I’m old? 
I never wanted children and neither does my fiancé. There are so many factors that play into it but when it comes down to it. I love not being a mom. I have so many friends who have kids and that’s great for them but i never would want. People always comeback with the “you can still travel and have your own life with a baby/child!” Um no lol i can’t wake up on Saturday and jump in the car and drive to the beach and spend the night in an air b&b with a baby. Well I’m sure it’s possible but not easily and i honestly don’t think it would be as fun. 
Also, i physically can’t have children. #CancerSurvivor so i feel lucky being able to say that as my reason. People tend to shut up when they hear the cancer word."

It’s been rough for her. But I’m glad she’s safe now. It was terrifying getting that call so early in the morning."
relationship_advice,fgoymhu,t1_fgoxe5g,1580992000.0,"I did explain to her how dangerous it was and she did promise. Thankfully where she lives is considered very safe but she did promise. 
Thanks for confirming my thoughts too. I honestly don’t want to tell my sister so I’m glad you validated that."
landscaping,fgb2c8d,t1_fg9e6zh,1580657794.0,"Oh gosh, stupid autocorrect, I meant Meadow Grass. I’m so sorry haha basically it’s a very thick never dies type grass. Commonly used in our area for older developments and cemeteries. 
And we tried spraying weed killer, never heard of weed torch but I’m highly allergic to grass and most weeds and when we tried pulling it down it’s really thick rooted. It popped through the weed barrier the old owners put down."
AskReddit,fg2w248,t3_ewcpzl,1580458373.0,"My best friend of 5 years met a guy and she got pregnant from him. During her pregnancy the dude pulled a knife on her and told her he was gonna murder her and and the baby if she didn’t keep the house clean. She told me a week after it happen and I told her she needs to kick him out (it was her parents house) and she said no because she’s not gonna have a broken family. That night she texted me saying to never contact her again. 
Fast forward to after the baby is born, the boyfriend is still abusive and her mother is diagnosed with cancer. The mom told her daughter if she doesn’t make the boyfriend leave then the mother was going to move out and fight in her cancer in a safe place. Her mom called me to tell me how bad everything was getting and she didn’t know what to do. 
Her mom died 8 months later. I tried reaching out but i guess she blocked me or got a new number. I really hope she’s okay."

weddinghelp,f61na2t,t3_dp33uf,1572642949.0,So i reached out to my bridesmaids! Told them what’s going on. 2 of them said they want to pay for their own rooms and the other 2 said they would share with no issues. So I’m relieved that it went so well. I didn’t want them to feel like they HAD to pay their own way if they didn’t want to or couldn’t. Thank you everyone.
weddinghelp,f5wfddh,t1_f5um4ut,1572522647.0,Thank you!!! That was extremely helpful!
weddinghelp,f5saamz,t1_f5sa4p7,1572419146.0,"They have the choice to have their own rooms but they would have to pay for it. The room does have 4 beds. 2 double beds and 2 sofa beds. We are having our wedding 6 hours away from where we live and we already have transportation down. So, I can offer the room but make sure they know they could pay for their own? I just know some of them are broke and probably couldn't afford the hotel on their own, if that makes sense?"

This photo is from a cat/kitten rescue in California (Mini Cat Town) they have 2 (or 3) huskies and they are very loving towards all the foster kittens they save. One of their huskies took on a mothering roll to their first rescue, Rosie. They have their own Instagram with all their adventures! Rosie actually goes for walks and goes out like their dogs do."
essentialoils,estew73,t1_esra6uy,1562266161.0,I often wanted to do this! Does the water make it last a little longer? How many drops do you put in?
AskReddit,es5efzq,t3_c5qq30,1561609170.0,She would go around and tell girls they smelled fishy then scream laugh while walking away. She would only target one girl between every class. We had a 2 floor high school so you could hear her laugh from anywhere. This happened 4 times a day (we had block schedules) It was crazy creepy.
AcademicPsychology,epp2iu9,t3_btugg8,1559361520.0,Nope you should be all good. But get to know your advisor and find a favorite professor who can help too.
AcademicPsychology,ep35lnj,t3_btugg8,1559017698.0,I already was planning my thesis and research topics in my second year. My advisor helped me put it professionally and helped guide me through getting my jumbled thoughts into paragraphs.
