Anxiety,fel21ms,t3_epktfq,1579212358.0,"I can understand how you feel and while our situation is different, I can completely relate to wanting to give up because of anxiety. Its horrific, you feel like your body isnt your own, that something bad will happen but really, it won't.

Saying you can't is pointless, because you can, you just need to try. Do your best and thats all you can do. Do not let anxiety hold you back but if it will make you live less of a live reevaluate how you can realistically maintain a work/life balance.

Feel proud that you got there, well done for making it this far! 

Push yourself and the boundaries your anxiety has given you and trust me, you will feel proud for doing it. It will be hard but worth the accomplishment you feel.

Therapy can definitely make you nervous when you start but that is someone who is qualified to help and they are there specifically to help you. I have recently gone private and found a wealth of knowledge and help on how to manage anxiety.

It is hard but we cannot let ourselves be defined by fear. I really understand where you are coming from and I struggle every day, cry before work but I get up and go because I need to and it is never as bad as your mind makes it out to be.

Congrats on landing your job! You obviously got it for a reason, so go and smash it!

Anxiety,fekzvro,t3_epp0og,1579211068.0,"Hey, I have been taking CBD oil for two weeks now.

I was actually anxious about taking it because I was worried about getting high or feeling spaced out, however, upon taking it, all it really does is help you calm down.

I take CBD oil orally and put two drops under my tongue, it doesnt taste great but after a minute I have a drink and let it kick in! 

Definitely calms my mind a bit but so far hasnt helped with physical anxiety but I am going to add a couple more drops which I hope has an effect.

You could also look into Rescue Remedy which does the same thing but is natural remedies without CBD.

Overall, it is worth a go, gets you out of your own head and calms you.

Just remember though, you will be ok, no one really notices our mistakes, so be you, be your best and be proud of yourself!

It sounds like you are both in a horrible situation.

I would suggest messaging her and telling her that she has your support, your love and that you will stand by her when she fights through this.

People with depression need to be told they have that person there for them, rathen than being told you need to this and that.

For therapy, it is the best thing she can do. Encouraging her to do so without being pushy and again showing your support will help. 

I know you may have already tried this, but honestly telling her straight up that you are gonna fight this with us is what she will need to hear without evening knowing it.
