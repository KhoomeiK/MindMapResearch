Anxiety,fq2wa2f,t3_gaarcc,1589060482.0,"For the first time in my life, I started waking up early AM with uncontrollable shaking, crying, and just the feeling like all my emotions were hyperventilating. This all was a 3 day stretch keep in mind . The second day it happened it had me throwing up and shaking so bad I lost 6 pounds in the first two days. The 3rd day this happened I woke up at 5 am and basically had a panic attack till I was in the ER . I've always hidden my anxiety, but it will catch up, wether in your sleep or while you're awake.
