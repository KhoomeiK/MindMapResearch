Water_Fasting,fb55izy,t3_ebi71e,1576521375.0,"That awesome. What is your intention for the fast if you dont mind me asking?

I did a 14 day fast at the beginning of November of this year. It was amazing for my health.

Remember to get up gradually if you've been sitting or lying down for a while to avoid getting light headed. (Fasting lowers blood pressure)

At the end of my fast my GI tract felt completely healed and inflammation in my muscles and joints seemed have disappeared completely. (I also set an intention mentally that this would happen) 

You are going to feel amazing. My other reccomendations: Go outside for walks if you can and listen to guided meditations for health and healing. This one I listened to yesterday was quite good:

1. Demystify/Destigmatize Fasting
2. Provide accurate, neutral/balanced views on fasting practices
3. To accurately disclose the risks as well as the benefits of fasting.

fasting,faibvak,t1_fai99ty,1576104199.0,"That's great to hear. The main thing is you're taking care of yourself. 

Healthy eating habits are far more important to establish than increasing the time we fast. Healthy eating is sustainable for a lifetime. Fasting is more of a tool for autophagy, at least thats the way I see it. 

A couple things that come to mind:

1. Even thought you may be overweight now, start referring to yourself as svelt, fit, slim, healthy etc, Start thinking these 'healthy-self' thoughts about yourself. Before bed see the healthy, best version of you and imagine that you're already that person, as you are now. It's only a matter of time that you loose the weight. The mind is a very powerful organ and I'm in the camp that believes we can consciously influence our bodies processes. 
2. if you're worried about loose skin and weight loss, Jason Fung (whom I don't know much about and can't recommend anything he's written, due to not reading it myself) shares an interesting hypothesis that perhaps by being in autophagy, our bodies consume the proteins that make up the skin, preventing loose skin fromm weight loss. Pure speculation of course, but an interesting thought nonetheless.

fasting,fahv5yb,t1_fagokbd,1576094155.0,"I will definitely be covering IF.

The way I am looking at it currently, is that fasting is a spectrum. 

Intermittent fasting falls on that spectrum. I find that using IF to build toward an extended fasting practice, or doing IF on its own, is important in allowing our bodies to digest effectively. 

I am most interested in autophagy and the role of extended fasts in self-healing. The way I became acclimated to longer fasts was a graudual increase in fasting windows. 

How is your IF going? What fasting/feeding windows do you enjoy the most? I'm having a good time with 20:4 currently."

If you over do it on the oil you may get a case of the trots, not to worry. Slowly build up the amount of fats you eat.

depression,es3nz0r,t3_c5rv7q,1561566864.0,"Your mind has carved out its neural pathways. The feedback loop of 'I feel depressed/stressed, so I will distract myself' is simply a pathway in your mind that has been used enough that it has become a well - worn path across which these neural impulses travel.

You are aware of it. First step. 

Next step, have an actionable thing you can do to remind you that this is a mind that has gotten comfortable with a certain destructive habit. When you feel the slip into depression, stress and procrastination, take 3 massive breaths and have a thought like ""this is only chemicals and neurons firing, it feels like me, but it is not me"" 

The more you interrupt this pathway, the easier it becomes to interrupt. 

Then you can begin exploring the root causes of what causes you feel this way. 

When I was in school, I was physically taxed from playing sports and eating junk food (take care of your gut health, super important if you are feeling depressed, look into AIP and other elimination diets) and mentally taxed from the work load of school and my inability to manage my time. I still struggle but I am more aware that what is happening in my mind are simply thoughts. I don't have to follow them, unless I am doing purposeful introspection or meditation."
depression,es3n9mg,t3_c5rndw,1561566411.0,"Read the book 'the brain that changes itself'

These ways of thinking are simply neural pathways that have been used enough that they have become a pathway where impulses travel easily. 

Our survival brains work like this. 'if x, then y' 

If I see a cinnamon bun (x) then I will eat it(y) because life is temporary and nothing matters.

All that is, is a story. It is your dialogue. It's not even yours. You don't own that way of thinking, it is just how your mind is working currently. These are neural pathways being activated. It is not you. 

Being aware of the stimulus-response aspect of the mind can help us see these thoughts for what they really are, old programs, carved out neural pathways, that no longer serve us. They may have been useful at some point in life, but not anymore

Try this. 

1. Recognize the patterns of thought that cause you to feel nihilistic or hopeless. 

2. Have a replacement thought like 'although life is temporary, my attitude dictates reality and my health helps me to keep a healthy attitude' 

3. Each time you have a self defeating thought, know that it is happening because it is easy. These neural pathways have been carved out and its easier for your mind to simply go where it has gone in the past. Visual new pathways forming in your mind each time you redirect your thoughts to a more productive or positive dialogue. 

This takes time, effort and patience with yourself. You are a child as well as your own parent. Look at your relationship with yourself as if you were looking upon a parent talking to their child. If they were yelling at them telling them life isn't worth it, what would you do? 

I bet youd step in a say something, you'd stick up for the kid.

The difficult part is doing this for yourself. It difficult but not impossible and it is also well worth the effort."
depression,es3j059,t3_c5j15l,1561563650.0,"Keep this is mind:

You aren't following them home. You aren't with them all the time. The young successful person you see interacting in daily life and looking like they're on top of the world for their age group, might go home home after work, lie in bed and question whether life is worth living. 

I was a professional football player in my early 20s. People from the outside looking in may have thought I was an exception to self-doubt and depression but I was going through it like everybody else. 

Don't look at someone's momentary success or happiness and paint their lives with those broad strokes. Realize they hurt too. Just like you.

Currently I'm eating whatever, I'm drinking coffee and eating non-AIP. I don't feel great, go figure! Im getting back on the program this week and I will let you know how it goes!

For you (and for me) I believe the most important thing is sticking to aip for at least a month without going off the program so we can see how we react, all the while taking notes about it each day.

I feel the best when I am able to give my digestion 24 hrs between meals and I eat aip. The difficult part is the self discipline. When I am feeling dedicated I can stick to the program, but when I find myself unprepared or without a plan I go back to old eating patterns. I think the best way to do it would be to find your current eating window, and slowly shrink it down by the hour over a couple of weeks until your within a 1-2 hour window, which is basically one large meal. Eat until you feel about 75% full. If your job requires super high output it may be wise to have some food energy in the morning in case. But during my long fasts I've discovered the astonishing amount of activity the human body is capable without food. And to answer your question, I find my symptoms are minimized when I eat omad and do regular fasts.Typing this on my phone, I hope it's coherent enough."

&#x200B;

I started a media production business with a few friends of mine and I also want to sell these exercise bands that helped me cure my lower back issues while I was playing pro football. I had just retired from playing pro football and was totally into the idea of passive income and having an online business make money. I realized that living digitally totally robs all the joys of human contact and building relationships. While reading the lean startup, I came across a  few businesses who employed the 'Do things that dont scale' methodology at the outset. If I recall correctly one business was sending hand written thank you notes to its first run of customers.

&#x200B;

This is the best advice I have ever heard. I had been reading business literature and I was obsessing over scalability before I had a product.  I completely shifted my mindset to one that is focused more on building relationships with real people in real life. I have gotten my first job through meeting someone at a gym I went to where I did some free video work. I can't stress the importance of effective real life communication. I almost got lost in the sauce of purely digital commerce but I am glad I came back down to earth!

IWantToLearn,eovpmat,t3_bta3je,1558898811.0,"I was a professional athlete and now I spend a lot more time working from a computer. I have had a learn a lot about maintaining a healthy posture. 

The first thing about posture I think is important is that you know is this: Good posture is not one static position.

&#x200B;

Our bodies are meant to move, so trying to hold a position with a straight back and neck for a long period of time is unrealistic and unsustainable. While sitting down allow your body to shift and move and allow your posture to be fluid.  Stand up once and while and move your body around.

The muscles I have found to be the most effective as stabilizers are the Gluteus Medius and the Mid-Trapezius muscles. Give them a google so you can see where they are in the body. The Gluteus medius helps to stabilize the pelvis, and by strengthening my gluteus medius i was able to relieve my lower back pain.

By strengthening my midtraps I have found it easier to keep my shoulder from rounding too much.

Simply put, by sitting our hipflexors want to shorten and our shoulders want to round forward. If we strengthen our posterior chain and mobilize and stretch the muscles in the front of our body we can counteract the effect of sitting.

&#x200B;

It isn't perfect but it certainly helps. The most important thing to remember is you're not a robot and your body craves movement most of all. Subtle adjustment while seated and the occasional standup and stretch are huge helpers."
