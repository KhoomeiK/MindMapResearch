BPD,fqy04lh,t3_glkj9c,1589740469.0,"Having bpd and trying to meet and hang onto people can be so difficult, but I hope you feel good about yourself for reaching out.  

There’s a very nice, supportive bpd chat if you’re not already aware of it: https://discord.gg/esMPsF"
BPD,fqxvp7w,t3_gljaun,1589738588.0,"Firstly, you’re not wrong.  Loads of people are just out there double crossing each other and treating each other poorly but society has deemed much of that acceptable or at least the cost of doing business, ie being human.  Which sucks.  You may have things to work on as far as paranoia but you’re not wrong.  Both things can be true.  

Secondly, I’m sorry you’re feeling so isolated and alienated.  You describe the experience well.  We all need people, well 99% of us do.  Keep seeking them out.  I find that it’s better for me, speaking personally, to focus on getting to know others versus finding someone to get to know me.  But we all crave intimacy and connection. 

If you ever want to message me to chat please feel free and there is a great bpd chat with lots of people going through similar things every day: https://discord.gg/esMPsF"

And we all want to feel justified in our troubles, so wanting to take on the valid experiences of others is a natural desire if we don’t feel valid in our own experience."

BPD,fqo84tu,t3_gk06uy,1589509535.0,"Personally, and I can relate, one thing I do for ego training is to frequently remind myself, when I’m not triggered, that I am not my production.  I am not my IQ, I am not my work, I am not my reputation, I am not my appearance, etc.  Cultivating these beliefs has helped me be more patient when I feel triggered by an insult, although it’s certainly very much a struggle.  But it has helped.  So when I get triggered, my mind is more trained and fit to be able to try to counteract those urges toward false superiority.

Edit: and when I do go into that superior mindset it helps decrease the time it takes me to get out of that place"

Whenever I have reached out to people I’ve hurt, it’s usually unwanted.  They just want me gone and I respect that.  Although I’ve certainly went back and back apologizing.  I think it varies.  If you have already apologized, let it go.   Look forward.  

Of course looking forward means forgiving one’s self, which is no easy task.  I don’t really have any tips on that because I don’t know how to forgive myself except that God forgives me, and I should love myself as God loves me.   It’s a long toad though, I hear you.
