Plumbing,fqvxsiy,t1_fqvt8gl,1589687632.0,"I imagine it has something to do with the trap, my first thought when there was the gas. I’m just trying to figure out why water isn’t staying in the trap, particularly when my windows are open. If it only smells when I have a window open which creates a vacuum in entire apartment, might that help you explain the problem or devise a certain solution? Like either the water in the trap is getting sucked back into the hose, or maybe water is escaping between the pipe in the wall and the hose? Or something like that. Maintenance person will take a look at it later who supposedly knows more, though he’s not specialized in this kind of thing.  Interesting about the tip sizes. This machine is a near identical model to the previous so I imagine many things are the same. Property is newer. The sewage smell is definitely not coming from anywhere else. Have never had an upright get funky (haha) and it’s a brand new machine, area is clean, nothing else that could create that exact smell so strongly. It filled my entire apartment and even in the most insulated room with a door shut, I could still smell the sewage so much I could taste it. Have not run the machine nor opened a window for hours and the smell had dissipated. Opening the window has been the trigger. Not sure if washing more loads will fill the trap if I’ve already washed the biggest load and done some rinse and drains as I was instructed to do for this problem.  Which is why there is probably some adjustment that needs to be made."
Plumbing,fqvr31x,t1_fqvn4j2,1589683279.0,"It is top loading. By drain, you mean the box in the wall the hose goes into? Opening a window siphons the nasty air out (if that’s helpful info) but my old unit never had that issue, though apparently there was a bunch of grease on one of the lines, have no idea which line or what or where because I wasn’t watching. Might there have been grease on the drainage line to seal it into the pipe/box better? I assume the roof vent is fine as my building is well maintained and the problem started as soon as my machine was replaced.

Watercolor,fquc26s,t3_gkw5wy,1589656060.0,"I would choose the Winsor and Newton set. 24 is already many colors to start with and you want to practice mixing them yourself too. I initially painted more with a waterbrush than a normal brush. They are very convenient, easy to use, and work well for washes and coloring in areas, but are more difficult to use for details. You may want to switch to a normal brush for details. Water brushes also are not as durable as normal brushes. My favorite is the Pentel Vistage (used to be called Aquash) as it is easy to operate and doesn’t leak. I’d recommend the medium or large size for working in small notebooks. But for larger paintings, you’ll probably find normal brushes more useful most of the time. But if you can afford both, get a water brush and a few normal brushes. Also make sure you have proper paper. Cotton watercolor paper is ideal. But at the very least use a good quality cellulose watercolor paper. If it’s not watercolor paper, or bad watercolor paper, it will hold you back."
Watercolor,fqub797,t1_fqtnhwk,1589655579.0,"This is the correct answer. Buy one color if that’s all you can afford, maybe a higher tinting color like phthalo blue so you can get more range. Getting 3 primaries would be better for the ability to mix a wide variety of colors. Even better is getting a split primary palette of 6 colors, a warm and cool version of each red, yellow, blue color families. Anything else is a bonus. Some useful colors beyond that are some earth tones (burnt sienna, yellow ochre or a similar earthy yellow, a darker mid or cool brown), a green or two (phthalo green and sap green are most popular), a gray (Payne’s gray is popular but get whatever you like). That’s the best starting place. Some people trying to save money buy the cheaper pigments from cheaper brands, some of the earth tones for example. So if you are buying professional paints, probably better to prioritize buying the bright colors from the good brands before the more muted ones, assuming you buy a little at a time."

And to echo what others have said, yes, certain paints can be toxic. How toxic depends on what the paint is made out of, how much you consume at a time, and if you have a bad habit of doing this regularly which means more exposure. Children’s paints from reputable brands that say non toxic are safe, but if it’s really cheap or something from a dollar store, Wish, or some generic product probably from China but private labeled with multiple companies, those can often be toxic. Professional paints can be toxic too, but the main professional paint companies won’t hide the fact. There will be warnings on the packaging of info you can get on their website, if you are not already familiar with pigments that are inherently toxic."

Watercolor,fodgh6o,t1_fodepsp,1587684387.0,"It depends on the paper and if you are adding paint to wet paint, or adding paint to blank paper with water on it. For the first, I tend to use less water, or use less water for a smaller area. For larger areas, white paper, and/or if you really want your colors to flow and mix together in a random manner, then more of a puddle might be your thing. But keep in mind that the more water you add, the less control you have over where the paint goes, and so this may not be good if you’re trying to paint details. If I am blending colors and want more control, I either add color (or just water) to paint that is still fairly wet, or I wait for something to completely dry and then blend with a small amount of water.

But you might want to experiment and try both on a sheet of paper to see how your paper reacts. Thicker paper or cotton paper can take more water. Thinner paper or cellulose paper has more issue with a lot of water."

Watercolor,foc097v,t1_foblyc9,1587665672.0,"Some paint brands and lines and even certain colors crack, shrink, or dry differently. Professional paint lines (reputable brand professional paint, not student) more reliably can be reactivated from pans if your pour yourself. Any other paints, I would do some research. Cheaper or lower quality paints crack more I would guess because of the opaque chalky opaque pigments and fillers added to them which crack easily. This is why gouache cracks more than traditional watercolor when used this way. Supposedly you can mix in a little honey (or maybe glycerin or gum Arabic? Research this first.) to the paint to help with this but it’s not ideal.

So first thing is to buy professional grade paint (professional not student Winsor And Newton, Daniel Smith, M Graham, Sennelier, Schmincke, Holbein, etc.). Research which colors might crack or cause issues (viridian and colors made from gemstones are more likely to be problematic).

Also keep in mind that paints that contain honey like M Graham and Sennelier are less prone to cracking and stay moist, but they are not ideal if you live somewhere humid as they can get moldy and also do not travel well, can drip out of the pans.

Fill each pan 3 times. First fill should only partially fill the pan. Let it dry for a few days. Add another layer of paint and wait another few days. Add the 3rd layer all the way to the top or even a little above and let dry. The paint often shrinks as it dries. Also, fill the corners, stir with a toothpick if necessary, and tap each pan on the table to flatten it and get it to fill evenly. If cracking occurs, you can just choose to deal with it or mix in"

Best time to blend is when the paint is wet. Like the other commenter said, wet in wet may work well for you. Paint some clean water down first and then drop the paint into it. Or add paint to already wet paint. If your paint is good enough, you can also do a little blending with a clean wet brush if you wait for the paint to completely dry.
