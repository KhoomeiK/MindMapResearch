BPD,fqq8jn0,t3_ggeroa,1589561227.0,"thank you so much for this post. been diagnosed with bpd for a year now and always felt so self-conscious whenever i would see people on twitter or on this thread making generalized statements about being empaths and applying it to every pwBPD. i have always severely struggled with empathy and have a hard time relating to or feeling pity for others, because frankly i find it hard to conceptualize most emotions and i think a lot of peoples problems are trivial. sometimes hearing others vent/rant fills me with severe rage that i don’t entirely understand. i think it has something to do with my fluctuating self image (which actually IS one of the diagnostic criteria) and sometimes my ego can be inflated out of whats appropriate for the situation. i feel that most people are using the ‘empath’ identity to compensate for the widely negative view on this disorder and sort of prove to others (and themselves) that bpd isnt all bad."
AmItheAsshole,fqmw9z6,t1_fqmvmmx,1589484586.0,"also just to add to this, when i decided to switch my major from psychology to studio art, my parents didnt bat an eye because they SUPPORT my decisions/personal autonomy and understand that art is something im passionate about. she is an adult and can make her own choices and news flash buddy: college isnt for everyone and especially in these times, you can get just about any entry level job without a college degree."
AmItheAsshole,fqmvmmx,t3_gjmicg,1589484279.0,"YTA x5000. As someone who is about to graduate college with a degree in Studio Art, I found this post incredibly disrespectful and demeaning. Art is a job, and an incredibly competitive one too. The fact that your daughter has been supporting herself AND her boyfriend with her freelance work is amazing and not an easy feat. I have a part time job unrelated to my studies but I also do commissions for people on an occasional basis, and let me tell you, that shit is just as demanding as any 9-5 office job. You have to have a distinctive and unique style, practice at your art constantly to improve, have good customer service/negotiation skills, act as your own PR person to advertise your business, and deal with pricing/inventory/bookkeeping all while acting as your own boss. Thats essentially three different jobs in one. Sounds to me that she is incredibly successful and is lucky to have a career that she enjoys. Sucks that she has a parent that wants to tear her down so badly. Maybe you should reevaluate your opinion on what constitutes as a career and your ability to be a good role model."
AnimalCrossing,fpdb1zm,t3_g997ij,1588523462.0,so i just started playing the game about two weeks ago and i currently have five villagers on my island (the two that i started with and then three that moved in after a couple days). my question is when will i start finding other villagers on mystery islands? i havent seen any characters on the random islands ive visited since the three moved in and im just wondering how long before i can find more?
AmItheAsshole,fhiv6ds,t3_f39wni,1581632479.0,"what in the caucasity? my guess is your MIL and that side of the family is insecure about status and appearing a certain way to others. imo, thats the only reason why people who are extremely invested in breeding particular types of dogs and selecting more “desirable” purebreds get into that practice; to appear wealthy or high class. she’s clearly projecting some sort of insecurity about social status onto you. its not really about dogs vs. cats, but upholding an image of privilege  and reputation in your community. this is shitty and youre definitely NTA!"
TooAfraidToAsk,fh7xurs,t3_f1mt4v,1581347484.0,"ive wondered this myself, especially because many people looking to adopt are unable to have children themselves for medical reasons but would make perfectly respectable parents. why should so many restrictions be put in place for people who already are naturally limited in their decisions?

in my mind, the reason adoption processes are so complicated is because many children up for adoption come from underprivileged backgrounds or have some sort of trauma/mental disadvantages. the institution (hopefully) has these barriers in place so that vulnerable children are going into the best care possible. of course this is just speculation."

the only side effect is increased drowsiness throughout the day - seroquel is very potent - but im working with my psychiatrist to decrease the dosage."

BeautyGuruChatter,f5asas5,t3_dng9ly,1572112791.0,"a couple people in the comments of this thread have touched on it, but i think the generation who grew up with beautubers (genx/millennials) are adapting to the current leftist political climate.

not to get all poli sci on yall but our generation as a whole is becoming more aware of the pitfalls of capitalism and over consumption of products. many are rejecting this lifestyle as a whole (see eco conscious/minimalist/waste free lifestyles rising in popularity) or simply do not have the resources to afford keeping up with so many product releases and shiny new brand collabs. this is a good thing for our society but a bad thing for youtubers whose entire livelihood depends on pushing products to who they assume are easily swayed consumers.

these youtubers fail to see that the gen pop dont live in luxury like they do. their demographic (ages 18-30) are more socially aware than ever, and financial insecurity in this political climate is a very real thing that ebbs in the back of our minds. im juggling two part time jobs rn as a full time college student who is using pretty much all expired makeup bc i have more important shit to buy??? like “yaAAs mOrPhE” but also “yaaas having a savings account and reducing my ecological footprint by not purchasing wasteful products that go bad in six months anyways”

***edit: this is from an americanized perspective i realize not all countries have this same political trend!!"

birthcontrol,etdyj2l,t3_cb6iyx,1562718428.0,"i love the patch so much! ive been on it for four months now after switching from the pill (which was a total nightmare for me) and have had no problems. ive noticed 0 weight gain, rarely get tender breasts, and its great because you only have to remember to switch it out once a week! the only downside ive noticed so far is that i do still get light spotting for a few days before my patch free week, but its nowhere near as bad as the spotting i had on the pill so i cant complain.

you are protected the patch free week as long as you take it off/put the new one on at a consistent time and day, and as long as it never fell off at any point during your cycle. ive had one incident recently where my patch fell off while swimming, and had to replace it. it holds up well in the shower and in the ocean from personal experience, but fell off almost immediately after getting into a chlorine pool (not sure if the chemicals effected the adhesive or if my patch was just loose to begin with.) that is the only time ive ever had a problem with it coming off.

i wear mine on my lower abdomen and switch sides every week so as not to irritate my skin. in that location, its not noticeable when wearing normal clothes, but can be seen in a swimsuit (it doesnt bother me, but thats up to preference) sometimes little fuzzes collect around the edges of the patch from clothing but i just gently scrub at them with a damp q tip and that does the trick. hope this is helpful!"
BPD,et75wdr,t3_ca8xyo,1562525451.0,i feel exactly the same. for a week i felt totally “normal” and was functioning just fine without any intrusive thoughts or emotional breakdowns. then just yesterday the streak was broken and all of the abandonment issues and insecurities came flooding back. it sucks because you almost trick yourself into believing that youre fine.

BeautyGuruChatter,et5ygfw,t3_ca2obu,1562496925.0,"the fake accounts and delusion remind me of a black mirror episode. i honestly feel bad for this girl because her ego is severely inflated by the hands of her mom, who is CLEARLY living out some fantasy world through her daughter. nonetheless, its extremely fucked up that shes accusing this thread of being “racially insensitive” when shes the one creating obviously fake accounts that perpetuate laughable stereotypes. this is better than the moldy lipstick scandal."
BPD,et2wxr8,t3_c9p3r3,1562424137.0,"mine definitely stems from emotional invalidation and verbal abuse growing up. i suspect that my mother has bpd, as she exists in a perpetual state of irritation and can get hostile over the smallest things. while my parents overall provided basic needs and a comfortable life for my sister and i, whenever my mom would get into one of her “moods,” all hell would break loose. we would get into hour long screaming matches in which she’d verbally berate me and bully me about things i cant change about myself (my bad posture, my weight, etc). on a few occasions, she’d threaten suicide or disappear for hours on end without telling anyone where she was going. her emotional disturbances and invalidation of my own feelings most definitely contributed to my development of bpd. despite the fact that i was supported by my parents when it came to my academics (i excelled in school, which brought a lot of pride to my family), my emotional maturity was stunted due to my inability to open up to my mom from fear that i would get shut down or harassed. our relationship is better now that i live out of the house, but we still have our moments and i still dont trust her. she doesnt even know i have bpd."
BeautyGuruChatter,eszz2ef,t3_c9lu0k,1562370155.0,this is honestly embarrassing.... imagine being an adult and having your mother fight your own battles; despite the fact that there was no hostility in the original thread to begin with. someone CLEARLY is getting overly defensive because she has something to hide. if the shoe fits :-)
BPD,eskvgc6,t3_c87uy6,1562074351.0,"this is freaky accurate to my life, its as if i wrote this... my mom is not diagnosed with BPD but did receive treatment for depression and anxiety in her college years that she never kept up with in to adulthood. she shows a lot of BPD traits; high emotional reactivity to small situations, playing a victim role through manipulation, unwarranted anger or irritation, and the list goes on. shes stable for a good majority of the day, but if someone triggers her she can turn extremely hostile very fast. throughout my childhood, especially when i was in middle school/early high school we had a lot of conflict because shes incredibly demanding and can be verbally abusive during an episode. she would resort to name calling, or could turn to microaggressions that nitpick at my insecurities (honestly this was worse than her anger bc they were so subtle yet so scathing.) ive spent a lot of my life tip-toeing around her so as not to set her off. the scariest moments have been when shes threatened suicide. on one particular occasion, she was verbally abusing my younger sibling and i, and when things escalated too far, she locked herself in the bathroom and turned on the bathtub faucet. she let it run for an hour, so obviously my sister and i thought she was trying to drown herself. we freaked out, screaming, trying to knock down the door, and after multiple failed attempts, she exited the bathroom calmly as if nothing had happened (not wet, still wearing her clothes.) shes been better recently, especially since i moved away for college, but i feel that years of suppressing my own feelings and choosing how i speak very carefully has stunted my emotional maturity. like you mentioned, im definitely quiet bpd. i never rage at others, and i rarely show people my mood swings. its all very internal, and my therapist and i agree that this can be attributed to the environment i grew up around. my mom is a great mom, always had a job, had food on the table, met my basic needs, but our actual maternal relationship is severely lacking.

BPD,esfqzlp,t3_c7jusa,1561932891.0,"i relate to this, and it brings upon me a lot of guilt and frustration. i never experienced trauma as a child, and grew up with two married parents in a middle class household and nice neighborhood. i did have some conflict with my mom growing up, but nothing that could be considered abusive or dangerous. i had some mild stressors in my childhood but definitely nothing that would lead to such a serious diagnosis. ive always just been a sensitive/emotional person, so my guess is theres some genetic or biological component at play. it has been proven that BPD can be inherited, which makes sense for me personally since i have a family history of mental illness. but i understand where youre coming from, its kind of upsetting not having a definite answer as to WHY we feel this way."
