Its sick. It really disturbs me. 
I talked to an professional about it and my sudden panic onsets and she basically said I'm doing everything right.
I'm acknowledging the ridiculousness of these thoughts, I'm not convinced it will happen to me or baby, I'm aware they are anxious thoughts and over reactions. I physically try to remove myself from feeling panicked, I try to switch my thoughts to something else and affirm myself its silly.

I was on latuda for a year and after researching and talking to my psych I went off meds and tried to see if I could do pregnancy without it. It did NOT end well lol. I went to a new and better psych who started me on lamotrigine which is one of two pregnancy safe mood stabilizers (I live in alberta, Canada for referance) and it has been amazing!!!! I'm so happy with it. I had some heightened anxiety while upping the dose but otherwise no side effects. 
I'm planning to stay on it after birth, it's worked better than anything else I've tried. 

I'm personally really worried about PPD so I've been in contact with my psych, counsellors and a mental health nurse to get regular check ins done after birth. 

I feel prepared for this.

I like to research and provide resources for friends or family in distress for example maybe look up local support groups, online forums, self care options available in your city, free counseling or drop ins etc. For if she finds herself struggling emotionally/mentally it's never a bad idea to provide information and educate yourselves
