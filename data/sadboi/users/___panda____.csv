One last question: There is no draft mode in the traditional sense. And I guess there will never be, as no booster packs exist, right. I am a limited only player on MTGA and enjoy it immensly. However, the I'm not sure how much I'd enjoy the LoR 'draft mode' (I guess expeditions or something)."

aspergers,fp5241k,t1_fp48vw7,1588313866.0,it's absolutely fine. I'm over both of it :)
genetics,fp2yose,t1_fp2ya67,1588270112.0,"Hm. I'm not exactly a neuroscientist. But as I see it, both could work out to investigate this. To me this sounds like a rather traditional experiment, that was done with bulk RNA seq for decades. However, if you expect this mutation to affect different cell types differently then you might actually find out more (potentially) than with just bulk RNA-seq."
genetics,fp2wqx0,t1_fp2w9as,1588269171.0,"Yeah, first cost of course. 
But it very much depends on the question you are trying to answer.
The core advantage of singlecell RNA-seq would be detecting novel cell types. So if you want to check if your 'mutation' or knockdown leads to neurons developing into an unknown novel type of neurons, you could not do that with bulk rna seq. However if you are just interested in global gene expression in all neurons of your brain sample, then you could also use bulk rna seq to investigate that. So it very much on the exact question you would want to answer."
genetics,fp2q4a3,t1_fp2pfwk,1588266010.0,"I'm not exactly sure I get your reply.
You are writing 'I am mutating a gene...' Are you talking about a lab experiment or a thought experiment (as you are using present tense)?
For this answer I assume it's about a thought experiment.
Yes you could do that. Just include a gene that is known in neuronal development. Then you could use single-cell RNA seq of brain tissue, disintegrate it and isolate neurons only. And apply single cell seq to investigate the alteration in neuronal development as a result of the 'mutation' or knockout/down. That makes kind of sense yes."
aspergers,fp2nz7a,t3_garr3c,1588264996.0,"I do not have any experience regarding that, as I was just diagnosed. But considering what the experienced people say, including the experts, it looks like people generally recommend not to disclose unless very much necessary. However, if once at the job issues emerge, it's mandatory to come out. I did not do that last year with acute depression and I lost my job, while they would have understood if I came out."

genetics,fp2mh55,t3_gayape,1588264281.0,"Yes, the main concern with single-cell RNA-seq at the moment is that it is super expensive. So if you've got a study where you will need a big sample size (e.g. complex disease etc.) then it is in most cases economically not doable to carry out a single-cell RNA-seq experiment.  
Also, the preparation of the single cells prior to sequencing is very crucial. So thinks like immunological studies using blood samples are easier to conduct than disintegrating a tissue sample (however, doable in certain cases). Also where single-cell sequencing excels at is especially two points: 1. Detecting novel cell types (e.g. in an immune response etc) 2. Study longitudinal development of certain cell types.  
Also, a consideration is the expertise of your bioinformaticians. As Single-Cell RNA-seq is rather new, the tools are also new and potentially unreliable. So a lot of parameter testing and validating is necessary."

Just for clarification: At this point I pretty much exclusively play draft. I only play some constructed games when I run out of gems (that was pretty much RDW only before the rotation).
Your suggestions make a lot of sense regarding knowing the meta.
I guess I could give Standard constructed a shot, as I at least have seen like 1/3rd of the sets included (started at ELD). Because Pioneer/Modern seem very daunting with a huge amount of cards, all unknown to me, and no idea about meta and archetypes etc. I very much IKO, it's by far my favourite set yet, so I might like standard with it.
My goal overall is to improve gamplay wise, so constructed might be a great way.
Also watching pros etc is a great suggestion. I would very much enjoy that. I guess I tried it a bit but most of the pros do not elaborate on their descionmaking, which is actually the information I'd need. So maybe I need to get a good basic understanding of the current standard metagame and then I will get pro gameplay.

aspergers,fn6jf7g,t3_fzpno6,1586700817.0,"Absolutely. It's very common for people on the spectrum. Also, some people on the spectrum do have that. It's called Alexithymia."
ADHD,fn2kt2z,t3_fys9h0,1586592713.0,"Yeah, it can be hard to sustain attention during socializing, so it's exhausting.  
But if it is a very common issue for you and maybe you have some sensory sensitivities, you might want to consider reading up on (the mild form of) autism spectrum disorder. It's very hard to tell mild autism from ADHD actually. (Just in case you never considered that)"
depression,fn2jv4u,t3_fyl2w3,1586591683.0,"Yes, indeed. That's the story of my life. And by coincidence (and after battling regular depression and nearly constant anxiety my whole life) found out at age 30 to actually be on the autism spectrum (on the mild end). Of course based on your two sentences I cannot judge that. Social difficulties can have a lot of origins. But if you, for example, have some sensory sensitivities (smells that you strongly dislike, don't like to be touched (especially gently), sensitive to sudden and/or loud sounds) and in addition maybe you like routine or like to do thinks the same way every time, maybe you strongly dislike sudden changes in your schedule/life? Maybe you have some 'excessive special interests' where you want to know everything about a certain topic? Maybe you struggle with social situations and often find yourself not knowing how to keep a conversation going, how to initiate a conversation, making eye contact, etc etc.

Mild autism is actually very common and often misdiagnosed/underdiagnosed. It is often not recognized. If these things potentially resonate with you consider checking out some female autistic Youtubers like [Purple Ella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjsi7wjs4ko), [Yo Samdy Sam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixRSb00BplM), [Stephany Bethany](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCaBAhOhzkU), [Laura Zdan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbcBdSLruL4), [the invisible I,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wKb5TUX49U) etc. Regarding books about autism in women I'd recommend ""Odd girl out"" by Laura James (also available as an audiobook on audible). But be sure to consider resources about women especially, as autism might show very differently in women compared to boys/men, that's why it's massively underdiagnosed in women.

Maybe I'm way off, that's very possible, but this just popped into my mind, as this topic is currently dominating my life and the journey of 'finding myself' that I'm currently going through.

depression,fn2ix4z,t3_fyrhlo,1586590686.0,"Yeah it can be part of depression, as concentration is impaired. But if you feel like it is always like that, even when you are not depressed, you might consider reading up on ADD/ADHD."
depression,fn2ituc,t3_fyr5jq,1586590593.0,"Just be honest with your therapist and mention this situation to him/her and tell how it made you feel.

Regarding the depression, I very much like using the [BDI-II](https://www.psychdb.com/_media/mood/bdi.pdf), as it's a method to actually quantify the depression, as it may be very hard and subjective to judge a depression and rate how bad it actually is. It's especially helpful if you are prone to depression, as you can use it on a regular basis and see if your score worsens.  
Just answer the questions (consider that it's not about today, but if you ever felt like that in the last two weeks) and add up the scores and check the grading on the last page (some grading schemes differ, but generally 15+ is considered a mild clinical depression, 21-30 is moderate depression, and 31+ is considered to be severe depression).  
This is a robust and scientifically-validated psychological tool that can be self-used with no need of a therapist asking you the things. So I very much like it and regularly use it."
aspergers,fn2ie5p,t3_fyquxa,1586590125.0,"Escapism is in no way bad. I would even argue it's unhealthy to call it bad. Because it will make you potentially feel bad every time you are retreating/engaging in a special interest etc. You should never feel bad to recharge. Escapism is probably what keeps us people on the spectrum going day after day (especially me). I honestly do not get what is supposed to be bad about escapism/retreating? (Of course given, that you still try to include some physical activity and some socializing in your life from time to time...)"
depression,fn01jcz,t1_fmzw55e,1586533739.0,"ah damn, I had in mind that 150mg were the maximum amount you can and should take. But it is 300mg. I was wrong sorry. So there is some room up. But when you already now have side-effects, it's very unlikely that they will get less with incresing amount of the meds. It's rather common,that people need to stop taking a certain drug (even if it works) because the side effects are not berable. And for ADD meds, this very often is increased anxiety, which is hard to accept as a side effect.
Just be sure to talk to your doctor about all changes in amout of med you take, also be sure to mention all side effects you are experiencing."
aspergers,fmzn3d8,t3_fy3k2m,1586525055.0,"Me, I've always been. Statistically it is affecting around 70-85% of people on the spectrum if I remember correctly (sorry no source, but I read it in Attwoods ""A complete guide to Asperger's syndrome"")

It can be confusing, because the sensitivity changes with time, and varies with stress etc.  
But usually it is against sharp sudden unexpected noises (dog bark, balloon popping, fireworks) or some regular humming sounds of electrical devices (like vacuum-cleaner or TV or Tools) etc."

It's nuts. Do you take stimulants in addition? I took 60mg of Elvanse (Vyvanse) to 150mg of Wellbutrin. That just killed me because of unbearable anxiety 24/7. Then I went down to 30mg of Elvanse and now it's not 24/7 anymore but only in certain situations. But I guess it might be the Wellbutrin alone. It's also strange that it is mostly only the physical symptoms of anxiety-like pressure on the chest and pounding heart etc. But not the psychological aspects (like worrying and ruminating). And I just had that since I started Wellbutrin.My plan is to get off it, but my last attempt to stop with antidepressants failed horribly, so I'm hesitant.   
(Not a doctor, please be sure to consult your doctor; maybe ask him for switching meds to a different antidepressant and maybe add a stimulant if you were taking it for the add rather than depression)"

I am disabled too, and have been at the same position you are right now several times. It's just so exhausting that at times you feel like you cannot do it anymore. And that's perfectly fine to feel like that. Living like that is exhausting as hell.  
Fortunately enough, I had the luck to meet a compatible person that was acepting me the way I am, and this helped me a lot. But also without that, you could maybe consider joining a selfhelp group or something like that, where you will meet people too.  
Also please consider calling the crisis intervention hotline of your country, they are happy to help. Especially when you cannot rely on family/friends, as it is the case for you. It's just super hard to go through such times.

depression,fmzas55,t3_fy1mcn,1586513246.0,"I totally get you. I'm in a very similar situation. Unless I fortunately just manage to climb out of depression through the right meds. I know it's freaking exhausting and I totally know that the whole uncertainty of the current situation is horrible. But your life and the relationship to your boyfriend/friends/family is so much more important than some economic factors. I hope your country provides some social security benefits to you, such that the uncertainty is manageable. Also, try to give your meds some more weeks. Some SRIs take up to 6 or more weeks to start to show an effect. And maybe you might even have to try another one or up the concentration or something if you don't start to feel better. Also cut yourself some slack for having suicidal thoughts, as the meds, especially at the start can increase that too, and be cautious, that they might you more energetic to actually try to carry them out. So please be around people when you feel especially bad, and don't feel bad for not being ok. That's fine that you feel like that, and it most likely is very temporary and will go away (I know it's hard to belief, but it is like that). If you somehow can bring up the energy to trick you into activity, please consider it. Physical activity, no matter what, is an even more effective antidepressant than any meds. I know it can be hard. But think about an activity that you enjoyed previously or that interesst you, where the barrier to carry it out is lowest. For me it was the treadmill in my house, as leaving the house was just to high of a barrier for me, I couldn't handle it. So what I did is, I literally forced myself to go on the treadmill in my house just 10mins a day. And it drastically helped me. Not even the physical activity, but also just to have been able to do anything at all. Try whatever works for you, if you are an outdoors person, try to go for a quick run around the block, indoors, you could try doing some yoga, or look for a 10-min workout video on youtube. If somehow possible (and I know you likely won't feel like doing it, and think you don't have the energy to do it), try that. Also going outside (or sitting on the balcony or in the backyard) to get some sun is really helping the mood. And most of all, don't try to fight the depression, that just puts additional pressure on you. Try to look at it as something like a flu, that you have to accept and sit out (I know it's hard to do that, but it helps). So allow yourself to get some rest and distract yourself as much as possible with whatever works for you (movies/series/games/reading/audiobooks...)

I am in the same situation and tried to find ressources on ADHD vs. ASD etc. But the bottom line was, that people do not exactly know the difference of the two and their similarities/overlaps. I've seen several experts telling that at this point even experts cannot robustly differentiate between heavy adhd and mild ASD for example. That was frustrating to realize. The only information I found was pretty much primarly literature, like research papers or stuff like that. I did not find books talking about adhd vs asd.  
But I just remember that Tony Attwood mentioned in his 'bible' called ""Asperger's syndrome - a complete guide"" or something like that. He mentions sensory sensitivities to be a hallmark distinctive feature of ASD. However, there are some cases of ADD only with sensory integration problems (but I believe that this might be an issue of accurate diagnosis).

aspergers,fmo8x4t,t3_fwc7zh,1586249858.0,"Yep. I'm in the exact same position. No one in my relatives are diagnosed autistics. But I do not think that there are no autistic relatives, but rather a lack in diagnosis. Even today, understanding is still growing about aspergers/autism, but in the generation of our parents/uncles/aunts etc. There literally was no understanding around at all. And with the age of 50, people might just get used to their struggles and accept certain things that they don't understand. Thus, there might be some autistic people in your circle of relatives that are undiagnosed.

I also got obsessed with why I might be autistic and the genetics of it. I also sequenced my genome and analysed it. But i soon realised that it is close to impossible to find a reason for your aspergers in your genome. Actually, in my case it partially worked out, but generally, it is thought that hundreds of genes are increasingy our risk for autism, but there is no one, or handful of genes that are known 'autism genes' (there are some exceptions of course, but it's rather rare). So the only thing you'll finde in the genome will be a handful of variants that raise your risk for autism by a tiny amount. But there is no way to judge where the threshold is, as everyone has got a certain amount of these variants. So it's rather frustrating.  
In my case I actually found two very likely candidate variants that are very likely to at least play a big role in my autism, as I got some detrimental variants in the oxytocin receptor, which in turn has shown to affect empathy and also some variants in dopamin receptors and a rather bad variant in MTHFR, very likely leading to issues in the development of the nervous system and known to lead to various conditions like ASD and ADHD, as the folate cycle is disrupted, which leads to neurotransmitters not being able to be produced (like serotonin and dopamin etc).  
But I digress, I honestly would not advise to go for genetic tests or sequencing your genome. It most likely would raise more questions than answer them.  
Also, you do not need to have 'evidence' to prove that you are autistic. You already got that with a diagnosis I guess. It's not up to you to prove it to the people around you, but it's their job to accept it. But I very much know what you mean."
aspergers,fmo7qr0,t3_fweo19,1586248538.0,"Hey.

First of all: you're a great human being!Big props to you for giving a non-average-joe a chance, even when it might be very difficult at times! Awesome people like you are very rare to find!Just a sentence to me: I'm 30 years old, male,  and am on the spectrum and also got ADHD.

First of all: Do not blame yourself for situations like these. Try to view the issue being in the different ways of functioning of the two of you and not one of your personalities. This makes it rather hard at some point to get the behavior of the other person (actually for both of you).

To be honest, I guess I cannot evaluate the situation thoroughly, as this would require the full communication protocol I guess. But as a general remark: I generally have an issue with text messages (emails, sms, WhatsApp, whatever). As it's very hard to judge how certain things are meant, without being able to check the tone of voice, or obvious facial expressions etc. What helps me very much is the excessive use of emojis, to assist with how certain things are meant. Generally, I very much dislike the judging 'being a jerk' kind of expression. I do not think anyone should have the arrogance to judge anyone, as there is no way to get why a person reacts in a certain way. Often past trauma, or numerous other reasons, that no one else has access to so. So why should anyone judge someone based on the very partial information of a person's functioning (btw. I'm just talking about that in general, I'm not blaming you at all. I like to think of using dogs as an example, as I love dogs (not that I'm comparing your bf or aspies to dogs, don't get me wrong :) ). If there is a dog that drastically 'misbehaves' in our eyes and therefore is not what we what or need in society, I am pretty sure that there are close to no dogs that are being born aggressive or 'jerks' or whatever. But the way they were treated previously, what they experiences etc shapes them in a way that leads them to behave in certain ways. Sometimes that leads to a 'aggressive' dog that bites etc. However, is that dog 'a jerk' because of that? Why should anyone have the competence to judge that without actually knowing 100% about that dog's inner functioning and 100% of the dog's past? The behavior the dog shows is just e result of past maltreatment and trauma, which leads to behavior that we don't like to see. Sorry to digress, but I hope you get the point.

So back to your situation. The one lesson I like to give NT people about people with Asperger's is: ""Do not try to interpret intentions into their actions."". E.g. He reacted that way because of X,Y,Z. Or ""He for sure did that to X,Y,Z"". That most of the time does not work out is also not fair towards that person. I guess that should be rather intuitive, I guess you get my point.

Also the behavior 'to want to fix the problem' rather than provide support is pretty much 'textbook aspie' behavior. That's very common for people on the spectrum. And I struggle very much with that and this lead to quite some misunderstandings in my relationship.But it seems like you are not judging that and you are getting that this stems from his condition. So, that shows that you already have quite a good understanding of the condition. Again, don't interpret intentions in this action of seemingly 'not wanting to provide emotional support'. This is how we work, and this is a huge struggle for us. I'm don't think there is a quick fix for this. I still cannot provide emotional support and just provide strategical advice and analyze the situation. What might help in that regard is again to focus very much on communication. Just be sure to very very explicitly state what the situation makes you feel and what would potentially help you. I guess you probably did that, but it's always worth checking that. Don't expect him to 'read between the lines' etc.

Also, speaking for myself, I very much appreciate if my wife brings up a certain situation and elaborates that this situation made her feel in a certain way and that she doesn't like that, etc. This provides me a way of troubleshooting the situation and learning from it. So I guess you could try to bring up the situation (and state explicitly that you want to analyze the situation and provide support, not to blame anyone) and state what it made you feel and what would have helped you. And then he also gets the chance to elaborate on his behavior. I very much like to handle situations like this.

Also, have you tried reading or consuming some resources for partners of aspies?I know of ""[Alone together](https://www.amazon.de/Alone-Together-Making-Asperger-Marriage/dp/1843105373)"" by katrin bentley. A NT partner of an aspie that writes from her perspective, but I found it to be very accurate.Also 'Mark Hutten' provides a lot of advice on his youtube channel for partners of aspies ( [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUZG9TJ9LHwSfmHb4ogQmxA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUZG9TJ9LHwSfmHb4ogQmxA) ).  
Maybe this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-dNIdpJMX4) by him may help you, but be sure to check the rest of his stuff out.

  Maybe you find some resources on there to learn about how your bf works.

But again. Big props to you for being willing to learn to understand him better, that's awesome. Be sure to look after yourself too and articulate your needs.

Please let me know if you can somehow help more, just shoot me a pn, I'm happy to help.

Sorry for the lengthy post.

Cheers"
autism,fmo4mg1,t3_fwbjsu,1586245207.0,"Unfortunately, this very much depends on the healthcare system of the country you live in (or your financial possibilities).

There are several very effective ways for a newly diagnosed adult to go through (I'm just in that position). Usually the most effective is to get some kind of 'coaching' by a therapist. This addresses ADHD and ASD as well. You'll just define your struggles and work on them systematically. Most of the time using an approach like cognitive behavioral therapy etc. In the course of that, it's possible to work on pretty much all kinds of struggles. In my case, we are tackling my core weakspots: Depression, Anxiety, Lack of social skills, and ADHD. With very specific approaches. There is quite a lot one can do to improve the life of a newly diagnosed adult. The most important thing is that you've got a therapist that you trust and where you feel like you are helped. 

Additionally, just reading up yourself on the conditions you've been diagnosed with and the strategies that are applied to treat them is very helpful."

And obviously the social difficulties would not be relevant, as there would not be anyone around. But I disagree with the expression, as you would still think the way you do as an autistic. You would still be probably highly logical, not too emotional (just speaking for my case), have sensitivities to sounds, lights, touch, smells, you would still like to do your routines etc. You would still be autistic in my eyes. Just the social struggles would not apply. But I totally get that you are trying to say that a lot of harm for autistic people is caused by how we are treated by society and not by the condition itself and this is true.

It sounds to me that you might be suffering from a clinical depression. Do you have a history of that? Do you have access to a thrapist? I would very much advise you to see a medical professional. As it's veeery important to catch the depression before it escalated and rendered you 'unfunctional'. That's especially important when you have kids that depend on you. Feeling like that is perfectly normal for people suffering from adhd, as it is super exhausting and frustrating. But a clinical depression can be easily treated with therapy and potentially medication and it makes a huge difference on the subjective quality of life. I did not even know that I was depressed a year ago, but after getting some antidepressants it very quickly helped me to stabilize my mood and it prevented me from falling even deeper into the hole. And of course the deeper you fall, the harder it is to climb up again. So I would advise you to act quickly. And cut yourself some slack. Being a parent with ADHD is super challenging and we are significantly more prone to anxiety/depression etc.

Let me know if you neeed more help. You can do it! The frustration/lack of energy/ tough mood etc. is just temporary. (I know it's hard to believe, when you are in a acute phase of experiencing it.). You can do it! I hope you have access to therapy! Cheers"

Society very much needs a better understanding of the autism spectrum. An estimated 1 in 56  people are on the spectrum, which means that most people are potentially dealing with people on the spectrum throughout their whole life.

There are a lot of things in society that make a life for people harder than it actually needed to be. One of the bigger parts is that NT people do not actually know what it is like and why people on the spectrum might act in a certain way in a given situation. So if there was understanding from both sides for the other way of living, it would and will inevitably lead to the world is a better place for people on the spectrum. Just think about what impact on global mental health a tiny reduction in the rate of bullying would be.  Or think about employers generally having a better understanding of people on the spectrum. It might actually be a game-breaking difference for a person on the spectrum to get their own office instead of a shared one with 20 other people. Or if the person is allowed to wear headphones and maybe the lights get replaced or dimmed. Or just other accommodations that make life much easier for people on the spectrum. But as long as people do not know what life actually is like for people on the spectrum they might not be willing to accommodate their struggles.

Pretty much the whole success story of the increasing wellbeing of people on the spectrum is based on a lot of public awareness work. It has worked in the past and it will in the future.

Sorry, I'm very bad at making my point clear at the moment, but maybe you get what I mean.

In certain circumstances, this might actually be the only possible way to go and understand yourself better. It sounds like that's the case for you.

However, I would advise taking Reddit and online communities with a grain of salt. No one is able to actually tell you if you are on the spectrum or not based on a paragraph.  
However, you personally very much can judge based on the experiences of others if you relate to the struggles of people on the spectrum.  
So I would advise that you check out reports from people on the spectrum and then judge yourself if it might be possible that you are on the spectrum. Try to read/listen to books written by autistic people or check out autism YouTubers (there are quite some out there). This way you might get a pretty good idea of what it is like to be on the spectrum.  
Finally, you might want to google some differential diagnoses for autism spectrum disorder and go over their symptoms to see if another condition might explain your struggles.

Good luck. Let me know if I can help.

Pro Tip: Read Tony Attwoods, ' A complete guide to aspergers syndrome"". It's suuuper comprehensive (the audiobook takes over 20 hours; it's hundreds and hundreds of pages). So after reading it and hearing a lot of lists of possible symptoms and struggles and quite some experiences of people, that you can get a really good idea of autism spectrum disorder as a whole!"
