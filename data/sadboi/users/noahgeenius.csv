BipolarReddit,fny7cbn,t3_g4hbew,1587355211.0,Try taking promethazine to help you sleep - it will knock you the fuck out and you can buy it over the counter as it's used an antihistamine . Lack of sleep will just exacerbate mania and wether you're bipolar or not you have to get some sleep to function properly. Don't feel ashamed if you have to take a pill now and again - it's a lot better than not getting enough sleep and being manic.

BipolarReddit,fme60k7,t3_fugsxp,1585990814.0,You should maybe try psychotherapy. Put yourself on trial i.e. weigh up the evidence and counter arguements - give yourself a fair trial

bipolar1,flmu9bt,t3_fpq3g3,1585296898.0,[M23]: I'm on lamictal (300mg) and I'll probably need to go on either anti-psychotic or lithium to avoid mania (I'm type 1). This a standard practice mood stabilizer + anti-psychotic to treat both depression and mania. I'm at the stage where I'll prioritize stability over anything else. Before I'd only take medication that didn't cause weight gain or gave me the fewest negative side effects. Now I'd hand over my kidney to have a years stability.
BipolarReddit,flj6vqi,t3_fp4c1e,1585200837.0,"What your feeling sounds like anhedonia (people who have lost interest in activities they used to enjoy and have a decreased ability to feel pleasure. It‚Äôs a core symptom of major depressive disorder and also bipolar disorder). 

Tackle the depression first this may also involve being patient (time does heal for sure) my depressive symptoms usually vanish by March as my bipolar is seasonal. Remind yourself of times where you did feel good and engaged ask yourself what you were doing? Sometimes I look at old pics of my cousin's and I to remember the good days (before diagnosis and even after) to jog my good memories. 

So when you're feeling depressed it may be very hard to find joy in anything. Try and break it down start with baby steps especially around health (exercise, therapy, socialising etc.) and hygiene (washing, cleaning up etc.) - things that will help you feel good about yourself and keep you moving forward and progressing one step at a time). Don't try and run before you can walk.

Quarantine and self-isolation aren't easy for anyone (I'm in the UK don't what it's like where you are) so my bro and I have been doing some home workouts together so this as an opportunity to start to feel better if you can - read a book or watch a film maybe.

Hope that helps ‚úåÔ∏è"

No one is going to wave a magic wand. 

Take your meds, do some therapy, exercise. It's extremely hard but you'll be a stronger, more understanding individual because of it and if you can manage this condition you can pretty much overcome anything. 

Don't blame yourself but take responsibility for your treatment and life in general here on out. 

Don't be beating yourself or overly self critical - try and be kind to yourself. Avoid self-destructive behaviour like drugs, alcohol, binge eating, not exercising etc.

Take baby steps;  don't try and run before you can walk.

The weather has helped lift the depression but I still feel quite anxious about the possibility of another manic episode due to the change in weather and I had a full blown manic episode this time last year partially because of this
bipolar,fkdulcy,t1_fkccq3x,1584095815.0,Haha yeah like I said I need a drug for when I go into hypomania for those emergency situations. Balloon metaphor or seesaw are the best for describing  type 1s (what goes up must come down - the laws of physics).

bipolar,fkbjuwp,t1_fkbg1h3,1584034340.0,Yeah it was a debate we had at my bipolar support group last night because in the UK it's very unpopular to put your kids on meds unless they really need it.
bipolar,fkbjnyd,t1_fkbf5k4,1584034236.0,Maybe it depends on what state. I hear all the time how certain conditions are over diagnosed but from what I've seen a lot of conditions like bipolar and ADHD are under diagnosed so people go through years of their life without the support they need and they don't understand what's wrong with them.
bipolar,fkbj3xs,t1_fkbb3jk,1584033947.0,"Sorry to hear that man. You were born too soon and I was born in the wrong country where we don't put kids on meds even if they desperately need it.

I think a lot of the people in the UK see it as unethical or its some big pharma conspiracy theory to have kids diagnosed but.

I've met a lot of people who think ADHD and bipolar are bullshit but when you meet people with these conditions they exhibit very clear symptoms that a 'normal' person does not. 

Regardless of the amount of therapy, exercise or holistic shit you do the bottom line is you need meds to live a relatively functional life unless you're rare exception to the rule and that uncles kids too."

I did some financial damage to myself last spring when I got really manic and spent ¬£2k or gambling and travel so now I plan on giving lasting power of attorney to my dad and eventually my brother because next time it could be a lot more than ¬£2k.

In regards to seasons. I live in the UK so from November - February the weather is fucking miserable and I get really depressed (however I did buy a SAD lamp this year which probably helped a bit but meds are more important as well as forcing yourself outdoors when it's sunny). Then from early spring - summer I start going up. When I was manic one of the things that helped keep me level was dark therapy because the sun fueled my mania."

In that case, the only thing I can recommend is to see if there are any bipolar support groups near where he lives (I don't know if that's what you meant by group therapy) - they have been essential in my recovery process and a big part of my support network. One of the things I wish I had known when I got diagnosed is that bipolar is usually comorbid so a lot of people have some sort of PTSD (something like 66%) and in my case, my bipolar is very seasonal. It's important because you don't want bipolar to overshadow some of the roots causes/potential triggers that lead to the bipolar diagnosis (often trauma-related) and the therapies/ medications can be very different depending on your brother's individual circumstances and biological chemistry. I was recently told I have CPTSD which requires two therapies completely different to that of bipolar so it's worth keeping in mind.

Don't get too obsessed with your label and try and do some talking therapy alongside your medication - don't suddenly stop meds if you start to feel 'well or good' because you'll end up setting yourself back further and most likely end up in readmission maybe not immediately but give a year and you'll see what I mean.
