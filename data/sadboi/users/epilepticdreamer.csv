schizophrenia,fl8heed,t3_fn6sat,1584923735.0,"I'm currently on Clozapine and love it. My psychiatrist said it was kinda my last choice cause I've been on so many different antipsychotics. It knocks me out within an hour when taking it at night which, I think, is a good thing."
schizophrenia,fl59njj,t3_fmf0fp,1584831659.0,I've had a good run of it. Still on it actually.. it's the drug that has worked best for me so far. My doctor said it was a last option for me because I've tried so many different meds.

schizophrenia,fk6m1kg,t1_fk6lnou,1583906566.0,I also read though that vaping is 5 times more potent than cigs..like the high or per drag? Is that true? Maybe I should go back to vaping.. it's more convenient cause you can do it in more places.
schizophrenia,fk5ssy7,t3_fgg9mx,1583887183.0,Oh forgot about Eyedea from Rhymesayers label. Same label as Atmosphere if you're into them.
schizophrenia,fk5o7ln,t3_fgabj6,1583884568.0,I'm the same way. I pace like crazy and my social anxiety is always at its highest.

schizophrenia,fk3gozm,t1_fk3g5kn,1583832667.0,Oh gosh man..I think vaping is actually worse for you than smoking cigs. I drink a lot of coffee as well. It doesn't effect me as far as symptoms.
schizophrenia,fk3fyqy,t1_fk3f3uh,1583831634.0,Agreed. I think that my onset was triggered by marijuana. It can cause hallucinations which makes sense.
schizophrenia,fk3fqku,t1_fk3f1yq,1583831311.0,Same. I quit drinking but I'm back at it again. I cannot imagine ever doing drugs again though. My mind is way too fragile. Do you smoke? I read that 90 percent on schizophrenics do.
