You're stats are good, but it needs a lot improvement. Your HP is too low, your offensive stats are also low... What about your IH?

For TOMM, the minimum is 80k for most stats. If you can increase Combat Advantage, do it. It's the hardest one to balance because you literally need all your stats capped. Some recommend getting as much as you can for that reason.

Neverwinter,fpibw11,t3_gdmd7v,1588637735.0,"Rogue is really a fantastic class! Not for being Top-tier DPS, is really fun to play.

This class relies on Stealth. It's a little meter that fills while you're fighting or after killing a few enemies, saying that, it's a cycle of filling it and entering in Stealth to do a lot of damage. It's a mechanic that takes time and a lot of reading to understand it. Ranged and Not Ranged classes have their pros and cons. The pros of Not Ranged is that is more easy to position yourself, but it requires observing mechanics to avoid big hits that can kill you or drain to your healer. Ranged classes also requires good positioning, but in most dungeons is not required to them to avoid because the big hits are mostly concentrated to the tanks and some Not Ranged tend to be really close to them or in the opposite position for Combat Advantage. Between us, playing a dungeon with only Ranged classes is really annoying for this reason. It tends to be more disorganized that having Ranged and Not Ranged together.

Every class has a way to dodge. Some are more easy to deal with it than others.

Anyways, you have 2 Character Slots. Try the Rogue and look if you can play with it. At least until level 20 you can have a grasp about how you're going to play this class in the long run.

Edit: Some probably will recommend you playing a Ranger. I don't recommend this. Ranger do a lot of damage with melee instead of their Bows. This is the reason they have the name of ""Fake Rogues"" in this game. It's sad honestly. It's a class that has so many possibilities to be even more stronger than Rogues. It is what it is.

This is straight up Sunk Cost Fallacy. So, there's not much I or we can tell you that will make you feel better about this realization.

Keep your main because everything your main gets helps a lot to the new alt.

Personally, I decided to buy out the longest campaigns. So the character I love now will be end-game in maybe 6 months with the time I have.

Your first and last job as a tank is keeping aggro. One thing is DPSes stealing your aggro and messing up with mechanics, but you have to enter that fight for aggro sometimes and you have to win it. If you can't win, means that you still not ready for this.

Focus on stats, that's your priority with your companions and your bondings. The stats are the ones that will help you to keep aggro and will help you to deal with the damage you'll be receiving.

Barbarians don't have a shield like Paladin and Fighter, so your class have things about tanking that are really specific to it.

This is the most complete guide I have read and explain really well the reasons behind it:
https://www.google.com/amp/s/cloakalliance.wordpress.com/2020/01/07/sentinel-tankingm18/amp/

This can help you to understand the mechanics behind and the changes of the paragon to campare it with old guides:
https://www.arcgames.com/tr/games/neverwinter/news/detail/11122233-developer-blog%253A-barbarian-changes

I can't say much... Hope someone can give you their point of view. I also play a tank, so the importance always is in keeping aggro with balancing stats, getting all the Hit Points and the stamina you can get.

Don't be scared or disappointed if you find it hard at first. Being a support role require a lot to learn. We define most of the time if the dungeon or run is going to go well. Some dungeons will require dealing with more mechanics for DPSes than the others. That's the hard part to be honest. At least for me. A healer doesn't have to deal with that.

I don't find any difference in my speech. My friend says i speak worse than before. My diagnosis is hebephrenia (in my papers it says schizotype because my psychiatrist wanted everyone to focus on teaching me skills instead of focusing on my hallucinations or being scared by the presence of it like it happened that time, it worked). Mentally I think I'm well, can cope, have insight, I found things that I enjoy, I talk to people thanks to those things... Hmm... So, I wouldn't call it recovery. When you feel your making progress and another thing goes wrong, just think how far you went through to get there. That's what helps me."

The only thing that's kind of bugging me is the fact that I'm not dealing with depression, so I feel bad if I think on my brothers having to deal with my death. What I did to don't think about it is discovering hobbies or more music. I discovered since last year why people love watching TV series, movies, playing games, listening to music, etc. It doesn't change the fact that I'm still dealing with the negative symptoms and that it's becoming worse, but it opened me to a whole new ways to connect with people. You can do this as an experiment. Experiment what's like enjoying things and sharing it with people. That's what's keeping me here. I want to see more movies, discover more music, I want to play The Last Of Us 2 and Path of Exile 2. I want to see where this is taking me. We can do this.

Neverwinter,fkodonu,t3_fjmtfe,1584385138.0,"A lot of people here already gave you good advice. Always channel your divinity, you're not a DPS. They don't care how much damage you do. You won't be able to kill something if isn't Cloak Tower or the epic version of those Dungeons in REDQ. ALWAYS CHANNEL YOUR DIVINITY WHILE THE OTHERS ARE FIGHTING.

This is the thing I see some healers don't do and then they panic heal. The other is always watching the stats of your group. So that way it'll be easy to identify why your heals are low on them or why they die so much or not. You start to find a pattern and can plan your encounters and divinity management.

Watch how much those tanks and DPSes with -25% IH sucks and are making your game miserable. If they didn't took the time to get the IH, you shouldn't heal them in private dungeons where they took the time to host and wait to play. It's easy to heal them, but they're so squishy and take more than 3-4 bastions to get them to full HP. It's not worth it.

Change Exaltation for Healing Word or that Encounter that increase your divinity. Ideally, you shouldn't use it, but being a support role is a long journey."

The only thing you can do is focus on yourself. Try to be the best version of yourself. Set a goal you can accomplish and benefit from that feeling.

I'm really bad with relationships. Mostly because people can't relate to me. I'm a negative symptoms mess... A robot. People even notice that I speak really weird. Everyone would recommend me series, movies or music and I would be there looking at them like if their speaking more disorganized than me.

I started to explore hobbies and finally understood why people love expending time with this. It helped me a lot because they can connect more with me. Still I'm not able to tell them my diagnosis. The only person that knows is an ex, but also understood about mental illness. Just the people that understand what's like living with it are the ones that will accept. I have the suspicious that there are people that realize that something is wrong because of the way I speak and sometimes I tell my weird ""thoughts""... Still people that understand what's like. The rest won't even see you as a person. That's the sad-not-so-sad truth."

I can understand the situation just by the reaction you had. It doesn't matter in what part of the spectrum (yes, a spectrum) we are, every case is different. The stigma was so heavy that you couldn't see him anymore as a person and the man you started to had a crush or fall in love. That's the only thing I'm seeing. He wasn't that amazing person anymore, he started to be the ""man with schizophrenia"". So, that drastic change after telling you that is something that we always experiment, but how people deal with that is what set the path if we should continue the relationship or not. That's the only thing I can add because I don't know him.

It's really stressful. I'm not saying just for him. Hope you can heal from all this (includes your past relationship)."
Neverwinter,fkfkp1q,t3_fi23ji,1584136549.0,"I have a Cleric... Someone already commented about it, so I'm going to avoid it. Except for the fact about the Radiant and Burning Judgment. When you understand that, the DPS is the best thing with ""hit like a truck and there's really no cooldowns"" in the game.

That's the thing with magical classes.

Paladin is kind of slow to level up. So it's the best to do it with the Healer Paragon (when you get to level 30). That paragon at-Wills do an incredible amount of damage and the blue shields are the best thing in the game. I really love it. Kind of want to work on the healer path too, but it's really expensive. Tank isn't as expensive as I thought it would be, but still a little more than the DPS yet not that close to building a healer. Tanking is really fun. The best thing is being the player that can deal with an immense amount of damage and not have the necessity to get heal that often. With tanking you don't have to ""hit like a truck"" because YOU'RE THE TRUCK. The best feeling I ever experienced playing. Obviously, you'll experience that when you're well geared and capped. It's possible to manage divinity with the Tank, just require to learn about the playstyle and the class.

Edit: Deleted my description with physical classes because I forgot OP was just asking about the ones with Healer/Tank paragon."
