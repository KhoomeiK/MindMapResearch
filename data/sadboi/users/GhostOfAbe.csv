School days, me, not even overspeeding on my bike. 45kmph, I remember because I was relatively new and very very cautious and even more afraid of getting my ass whooped by dad. Drunk car driver ""grazed"" me while overtaking from my left (we drive on left side so you overtake from the right). Slipped and mopped about 100ft the asphalt with my shoulders. Titanium plates.

>The greatest tragedy of the PC build arenâ€™t the words misspoken, the thermal paste misapplied, or accessories being misreferred to â€” itâ€™s that every YouTuber whoâ€™s ever outside of the PC space â€” especially if they happen to be a person of color â€” will now have to comb every word in their script to make sure an error doesnâ€™t slip. If it does, it looks like it will be a recipe for much harassment that continues to persist long after the spoiled produce has been buried.
