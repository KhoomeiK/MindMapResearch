Through college, I suffered severe social anxiety and depression and had to isolate from almost everyone. I didn’t make many friends in college and did not have the typical college experience. All of my “friends” from high school all went to college together in our hometown, lived together all four years of college, barely made new friends, and still.... hangout with one another... but they all moved to NYC or Chicago together. 

I’ve also had extensive therapy to understand this. I’ve felt so weird my whole life after high school and their bullying and mockery of me made me feel as though there was something very wrong with me for years.. like I was incapable of having and maintaining friendships. Now I realize I’m a very kind person and couldn’t handle their BS. A few have reached out in the last years or so and they’re still the same people... really petty, exclusive and are still in a popularity contest. Even only invited one another to their weddings..... it actually weirds me out. 


But now.... I’m happy and over it. I’ve made new friends, I have a great relationship and a very successful career. I’ve traveled, I don’t live in my hometown... and it does get better. I promise."
