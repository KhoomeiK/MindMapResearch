AskReddit,fo3dh3m,t3_g53q03,1587485021.0,"He became a different person while drinking. He used to be my best friend and then he started hanging out with my brother and cousin. I was a bit jealous, but figured it’s just guys hanging out as guys. Whenever he’d leave my brother and cousin would say he became a completely different person when I wasn’t around. He’d drink and berate people, lie about who he was, or lie about my brother/cousin in hopes of getting laid, etc. He said some mean things to me while drunk and I just cut him off. He slept over at my parent’s house because he was too drunk to go home. Luckily my brother was there to drive him. Last I heard of him was when I received a box in the mail with a book I had lent him and a letter inside with a quote. He also had a psycho girlfriend who kept wanting to meet me and since she was as crazy as him, I never met her. (My brother met her and insisted on us never meeting.)"

(Covid is preventing the latter.) But it's important that you help yourself in the process, whether its through therapy, family, friends, etc. Even talking here would help.

Although I can understand your perspective that you show emotion and you may think that’s what lets her have sex with you. If that were the case, sex would have happened that same day, or right then and there if it turned her on. Since it happened the following day, it sort of seems like “duty sex” but also just enough so you won’t leave. The minimum. Also, you’re asking for sex.

I’ve personally had many close calls with death, some unexplained things, but I couldn’t believe in a higher being. I later read the god delusion at 17, and it seemed to make sense to me.
