Coming from and abusive upbringing and finding a HONEST, HEALTHY relationship for me makes me tear up and get emotional. It sucks that I went through the shit I did but he doesn’t look at me any differently, instead he wants to protect me and love me, really love me. The love I thought I didn’t deserve."

CPTSD,fas2245,t3_eadkip,1576322642.0,"Funny that I read this because my parents are “overjoyed” that I’m in a HEALTHY relationship [mind you I was in 2 isolating, abusive, dark relationships for 11 years (which they knew about for 1 as they were about to put there home up as collateral for his bail bond - I know crazy and 1 I kept secret for 8 years while I moved out on my own and was the first person I assumed who “cared for me”)

Now looking back, I thought my parents dysfunctional relationship was a ‘real’ relationship was meant to be like — since I had their marriage as an example...sigh and sad!

So it’s funny that their now looking for grandkids after giving me no healthy tools or guidance in life but expect me to spawn the next generation of mistakes - F THAT! 

And in what fairy tale land would I want to bring any person into this world with their dark, manipulative, and toxic behaviour to spread on for future generations?! 

Therefore, little do they know I can’t have kids (undergoing surgery in March 2020 for tubal ligation) and I’m SO EXCITED to tell them during the holidays!!!

Hence, NO, no grand babies!

Even my new dog 🐶 won’t be pulled into there toxic world this holiday season. Even though I will certainly miss her dearly but I would not wish her the misery I endured for 30+ years!

I’m one and DONE!"
