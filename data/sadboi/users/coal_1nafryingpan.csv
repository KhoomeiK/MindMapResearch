So yeah when most people who work aren't even Native or qualified non-natives a 2 year degree and TEFL certificate is fancy. In Korea they have overhauled the criteria for just applying and in EPIK or GEPIK you can't even apply if your BA major isn't Education, English, TEFL, or Linguistics and you need a TEFL certificate. This is the starting line in Korea for teaching at a public school. The hagwons are a little more relaxed, but you can't teach English legally in Korea unless you are from an English speaking country and hold a bachelors. I know a dude teaching in China with an Associates making 6 figures because he is handsome and blonde and the school just uses him in marketing mostly as a photo-op. I also know a Russian girl teaching English that speaks with such a hard accent and can't understand spoken English well, but she is good in writing and blonde and makes 80k a year in China.

The fact that kids ways view themselves as better and things different as bad (this is what comes into play for racism towards blacks from non-blacks). The fact that economic status also plays into it. If you just read for your own self the studies on it you wouldn't keep saying ignorant things and showing the world this side of you.

Constantly growing up with stories and references to black being bad and evil and white being good and holy leads to racism. This has been documented and studied and can be easily Googled. A famous study seeing how early people are indoctrinated called the ""Doll Study"" showed white AND black kids were racist already. Hatred of black skin and features is not something only white people have at a young age it is also for black people. The difference is black people get many positive interactions with  black people and also they know themselves so jumping at your own reflection is out of the table. Black people have to actively try to undo the affects of society's perception of black and white on a daily basis or risk falling into a huge depression that causes suicide. People see drug use, promiscuity, and violence as an inherent trait of black people and ignore the fact that many of these people who also have the compounded factor of poverty that exacerbates their crippling depression. Even a rich black person deals with this depression and self-hatred.

A simple apostilled birth certificate copy with your parents names and another 2 showing they are in a Korean registry should suffice. My Chinese friend is an E2 and had to prove she was NOT Korean because some guy at immigration wouldn't accept her name spelling Lee as NOT Korean and said she entered Korea on the wrong visa. It was 2 months of annoying stuff, but her apostilled birth certificate and her parents passports and grandparents birth certificates from China and a wikipedia article about how Lee is a name found in multiple countries even England helped that mess.

Unexpected,fia8qd8,t3_f7al1r,1582295758.0,That legit traumatized me just now. Why are people like this? Why would you create something like this and put into the world? This kind of energy....
Cringetopia,fi9ptq8,t3_f6x34c,1582276338.0,I'm scared.
korea,fi56syz,t3_f62meb,1582156216.0,"This might actually change the culture of coming into work or school sick and infecting everyone you come in contact with. Also, people may start practicing proper hygiene and in all the East Asian culture of forcing people to ""push"" through what could be a potentially fatal and highly contagious illness will cease. I hope everyone that is sick gets better quickly and will not be stigmatized for the rest of their lives by their peers and neighbors."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fi3qoir,t3_f6btr1,1582125583.0,Jealousy is disgusting.  Get your own. The people that killed him are still the poor losers they were before and added murderer to their title of good for nothings.
korea,fi3hxwe,t3_f697si,1582119486.0,"Freedom of Religion. It's everyone's right to believe whatever they want to and even if you don't like it as long as nobody is hurt it's fine. Don't join the cult. USA has many cults and South Korea is not the only country literally every country has some kind of cult because every country has people. People make cults sometimes it's weird, but other things are weird too."
quantum_immortality,fi3a422,t1_fi2okd6,1582108529.0,"No, they are you pushed out. We all come from one source and each person is a different view/perspective that the base consciousness is existing from. It's like we are all actually imaginary. None of us are ""real"". We are the dream of this consciousness. We are an idea that has come to life. We are the whatifs. In your reality you are God. What you experience is all your creation. It's all your choice the good, bad, and mundane. Whatever you want from people if you focus enough you will receive from them. They have free will you are just tapping into the reality in which they chose freely to do or behave how you wanted. I also think some people aren't souled and are NPC's. I think those are the people that can't hear their inner voice....which is the soul and so they are just purely flesh systems running on the biological coding. They are like most animals. I also believe sociopaths are in the unsouled categories as well. Psychopaths I believe have faulty biological coding and autistic people are just aware of all the dimensions and aren't living in ours completely just like the schizophrenics."
quantum_immortality,fi2nm4l,t1_fi2jfl2,1582084056.0,All realities are existing RIGHT now. You are technically in all realities doing everything. Your awareness just changes. It's like a save point in a game. You also are the only one in any reality you have awareness in. Everyone in that reality is you pushed out. Only your consciousness breathes life into the stationary environment and events. They are all rolls of film essentially and you can look in them.  You are constantly jumping realities you just aren't aware of it.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fi22lxu,t3_f5m5hq,1582070047.0,"Yes, this way of thinking is called co-creating. It's the concept that we are collectively manifesting our world. We all experience our own version of it, but we also all maintain the illusion/simulation. Whatever we decide as a group to be possible becomes possible. We dictate the laws and there are ""master"" storylines we all agree on taking a part of together."
