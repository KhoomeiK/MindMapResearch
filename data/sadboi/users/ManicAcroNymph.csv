I got treatment, and gained the weight when I developed a thyroid disorder, which I also subsequently got treated for and stabilized my weight. I love my body now with the extra 50 pounds more than I ever did when I was unwell, I love the way my thighs, butt, and breasts jiggle and how I feel when my partner squeezes my juicy bits. My hair has grown back to its original length, but this time much shinier and stronger from taking better care of myself. I absolute love how I look- I think I‚Äôm the sexiest little thing, because my curves and healthy skin and hair are a testament to myself of how far I‚Äôve come and how much healthier I am now.

psychotherapy,ffi7cc1,t3_ets35n,1579966998.0,"It depends on what your definition and your client‚Äôs definition of ‚Äòhelpful‚Äô is. I work in a nursing home/acute care facility and my clients are generally dealing with serious health problems or are elderly and often lonely. Sometimes finding what can help my clients takes actually asking, and sometimes they vocalize what is indeed helping them. It takes time and rapport, really. I have a client who is *intensely* vocal about how helpful our sessions are to him, which sometimes makes me uncomfortable but when I think back to how much he has opened up since our early sessions I recognize he is likely being completely honest even if we have a session where nothing ‚Äònew‚Äô came up. This client‚Äôs definition of ‚Äòhelpful‚Äô has so far been rephrasing things or asking him questions that get him to find better solutions or ways of coping, which he has overtly described. I have another client who pretty much only rants and complains, but I‚Äôve learned to recognize that for her, having someone actively listen instead of brush off her problems has been enough for her after she asked me if something specific continued to be a problem, could I talk to my supervisor about finding a tangible solution? Meaning, she knows I have the power to both tangibly help as well as offer the support she needs in general. 

But I‚Äôm learning too that no, you never really know how you‚Äôre helping your client, but sometimes in one way or another, they tell you. Often times retention is a sign: if you are feeling like you aren‚Äôt helping them, yet they continue to show up and seem to do their best in showing you their world, I think it‚Äôs safe to say you‚Äôve been very helpful."
