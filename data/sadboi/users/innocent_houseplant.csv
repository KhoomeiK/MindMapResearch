Well, I prefer to not order from aliexpress lol.  Tail or dual switch is fine with me.  I like neutral white as color.  Hard to say on flood / throw, ideally a combo of sorts?  Budget - under 50 would be nice."
flashlight,foo5uhx,t1_foo52d8,1587933087.0,"No real interest in the USB charging ability if I have enough spares.  I did see that they need to be 68-69mm tall, not sure what the ‚Äòtypical‚Äô 18650 is. 

Also any suggestions on a multi mode handheld that runs off one 18650?  600-700 lumens is plenty.  I read the recommended thread and have some ideas but just curious if you have any favorites."

Anxiety,f32zln9,t3_df8edh,1570629127.0,"That‚Äôs so awesome!  I‚Äôm really glad it is making such a difference for you.  

It makes me sad that people have guilt about medication because all you are honestly doing is correcting an imbalance in chemicals in your brain that you have no control over.  I‚Äôve been shit on by some people I thought cared about me for taking medication but my wife reminded me that all I‚Äôm doing is putting myself on a level playing field with people who weren‚Äôt born with the same thing as me.  So please don‚Äôt feel shameful or guilty, there is nothing to feel bad about.  I‚Äôm glad you made the step to help yourself and it is working!"
Anxiety,f30mlb4,t3_df0n05,1570557684.0,Yep.  I feel like that‚Äôs kind of the curse of Anxiety.  You get to panic but you know you shouldn‚Äôt because it silly but you can‚Äôt stop no matter what.  It‚Äôs truly horrible.
Anxiety,f30a3o8,t1_f304xi6,1570549833.0,"I hope you can get it figured out and help him.  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs really hard to have them cream and be unable to help!

Oh ok so you don‚Äôt get to go in too often.  I just started so I‚Äôm like once a week right now lol.  Can you schedule more appointments to help or are they all booked up?  I hope it gets a little easier for you!"
Anxiety,f3024en,t3_desv1q,1570544636.0,Yes I suffer horribly from this.  I can be surrounded by people at work but if I‚Äôm not interacting I feel completely isolated and scared.  I haven‚Äôt found much to help but I like interaction so podcasts with a lot of people on then make me feel like I‚Äôm involved with people.
Anxiety,f2zp0wg,t1_f2yvfwa,1570533436.0,"I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that.  Do you have support from your SO?  Or a Therapist?

I still am completely willing to cry if I need it.  No shame in that, it‚Äôs our body‚Äôs way of letting out when nothing else is working."
Anxiety,f2ymmbx,t1_f2yhskm,1570494053.0,"Well I appreciate you making this thread.  Little reminders are really useful for me.  Hopefully you have support for how hard you work as a SAHM.  My day was alright, guess I‚Äôll chalk it up as a win.  I hope you did also!"

Anxiety,f2w2imn,t3_deigxn,1570460487.0,Honestly I started to have a panic attack when I walked into work and saw a bunch of stuff piled up for me.  I was able to reach out and text my dad for a bit and that helped me calm down a little but.  I wanted to avoid taking anything but I took half of my as needed medication and that has helped me to take the edge off and just try and work through things.  I‚Äôve been working on my breathing and trying to focus myself too so that is also helping.  Albeit as soon as I stop the fear comes right back.
Anxiety,f2gfgvk,t3_dde8b3,1570230018.0,"Hi friend, I‚Äôm sadly familiar with the combo as I deal with them myself.  Do you speak with any doctors or therapists to help?  I am on medication which has made a big difference.  I mean it‚Äôs still really hard some days but it helps.  

If you need to vent or talk feel free to PM me.  I have been there before."

I just went to see a new one today and I‚Äôm really excited to keep working with them. 

I‚Äôm really proud of you for deciding to go forward with it.  I hope it is helpful for you friend üòä"

holdmyfeedingtube,eyxonr0,t3_cz80sm,1567558652.0,This happens way too much.  ‚ÄúRoads‚Äù get closed for rally and desert racing and people disregard and walk and motorcycle on them and this is the result.  They also will stand in the road as the trucks get close and dart out at the last minute.  Bad idea when trucks are doing 100+ mph and the surface it great for slipping when you try and run.
