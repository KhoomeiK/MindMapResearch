BPD,fl446b6,t3_fm0vty,1584805504.0,"No. Sounds like you're mom is an ignorant shit. The only thing that will ""cure"" BPD is rigorous treatment for several years."
BPD,fl1m3p6,t3_flu15k,1584731708.0,"When I was younger I thought that I might have been non-binary or trans because I had a serious discomfort with my body and felt like I was trapped in a meat suit that wasnt mine. I eventually realized I didn't want to be a boy or androgynous, I just wanted to be skinny. Then I learned that what I was dealing with was body dysmorphia, not gender  dysphoria"
BPD,fkzqh1n,t3_fll48r,1584677454.0,I did it after a breakup. I swing back and forth between loving it and absolutely hating it
BPD,fjl3adw,t3_fdz8uo,1583439099.0,"I totally get it. I had that going on in my last relationship. While I broke up with him because I was afraid he was going to leave me, he was actually treating me very poorly and would do a lot of manipulative and gaslighting things to me. But I would convince myself that that wasn't the case and that I was the monster and had several complete meltdowns because I thought I had just ruined the relationship with the only person who could love me. 
 
It's so hard. You just have to keep reminding yourself that you deserve better, and no amount of longing for love will make him worth your time."
