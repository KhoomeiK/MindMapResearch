Some people’s brains think that means endless options, even though in reality, it’s still pretty limited to your area/where you hang out.

It also just makes common sense. I work in cybersecurity and am aware of how good hackers are. The power grids need technology to work. Also are vulnerable to physical attacks. There’s also always a “kill switch” protocol implemented that will shut it off completely, forever. To re-build a new system would take years. I always mostly prepare for this scenario, not necessarily because it’s the most likely CAUSE of SHTF, but when SHTF, the US power grid will definitely eventually turn off.

If this is the most lucid you’ve gotten, I’ve got news that can be simultaneously good and bad- you haven’t been fully lucid yet. It’s good because you definitely have the skills to do it and if you keep up with doing the right things to LD like writing down your dreams every morning, constantly questioning your reality throughout the day, etc. you’ll get to experience it soon enough.

After you forgot about seeing your mother, if you’re like me, I think the next  occurrence with a lot of potential for full lucidity was when you saw Jerry Sinefeld. Why would he be there? You don’t see celebrities often. No one really does unless they’re also a celebrity. There are exceptions; I’m not a celebrity but for a while coincidently saw a lot of celebrities in person for a few months. That’s why from now on, if I see a celebrity in real life, I will always question whether this is a lucid dream. That rule will likely mirror in my dream-mind. 
 
The next occurrence you wrote about- the girls doing the blue cocaine, that was when you started to get scared. That’s so much of a shock that your mind will want to ignore it and pretend that it’s okay/normal. Getting scared -> losing lucidity. Breathe. If something very, very strange happens in a casual way, politely excuse yourself if you’re with others and sit down somewhere they can’t see you (you should do this in real life too lol). Say the word “clarity” a couple times out loud. Then, be okay with the fact that you are fully lucid in a dream. This is your subconscious showing you a world just as real as your own! Explore it!

Because the data, general social trending, and opinions from experts and leaders show that it’s very likely that the power grid will go down in our lifetime.

LucidDreaming,fg6hfod,t3_ex5w3h,1580568060.0,"Just woke up from this one a few minutes ago! 

In the dream I’m exploring a big, grand old house that I’d just bought in what seemed like rural Ireland or England. A new house in a dream is a glaring dream sign for me as it occurs a lot, even though in real life I live in an apartment in a city.

So I gradually start to doubt reality, and then it clicks and I’m lucid. I look up to see that I’m sitting in the backyard of the house with my Mom. I say “Mom...” and grab her hand and it feels completely real- the warmth, the texture, etc. She says “lucid dream?” I say “yup.” Then I ask (never done this before) “what do I need to do or work on?” She says “well, for one thing, you keep telling yourself you’re dumb for some reason.” She laughs. “I mean you’re not one of those great super geniuses or anything-“ I say “but I want to be!” And she says “but for those people, it would be crazy for them not to be constantly working on solving complex world problems”. Huh... 

Then a guy I’ve never seen before walks up and greets us. I say “I’ve never seen you before...” he smiles and says “This is my first life, in here. I’m Carmen’s partner.” Well this confuses/surprises the hell out of me, and the only Carmen in my life is my friends 3 year old daughter... I think something like ‘is time different in here and Carmen has grown up?’ And then an older couple I’ve never seen before walks up to greet us and I say “okay I’m getting a little overwhelmed...” and I look back to see my mom is now ~20 feet away with a group of more people I’ve never seen. I turn around and then there’s another guy I’ve never met, and I realize I’m losing lucidity. I ask the guy “okay, what else can I work on?” And he says “I don’t know you, you can’t ask me that”. 

And then my alarm goes off and I’m in my bed. Literally one second in the dream, the next I’m wide awake in my bed. Very trippy, as usually there’s some buffer time in between and grogginess. I of course try to go back into the dream, to no avail (really hope to be able to do that some day).

This is a success of course, just wish I could have talked to my dream-mom more. Crazy, I checked my phone after waking and had a text with some advice from my actual mom!

- getting outside in the fresh air and sun before 9am (tells your brain that the day is long)
- cardio for at least 15 mins a day (sucks but it tires out your body and gets easier with time) 
- practicing meditation (also sucks but also gets easier with time. You learn to shut down intrusive thoughts)

These really all suck at first, I can’t lie. But once you get used to them and your sleep improves, your life gets so much better and they all become a lot easier. It’s really worth it, I promise. Best of luck."

Take a few days to wallow (I sometimes secretly love doing this- it’s an excuse to be lazy and do whatever you want!) and then start fresh. I PROMISE that you will find someone else that interests you. <3

ENFP,felwk5f,t3_epo5i3,1579232729.0,Yup. Sometimes I swear something just comes over me when I’m talking and I’m shocked that it makes sense to other people.
kravmaga,felwgf8,t1_felfjbh,1579232653.0,Don’t. Really.
kravmaga,felwfs1,t1_felsen5,1579232639.0,"Agreed, I already have bruises from my first three classes but I don’t care. Things like that prepare you to ignore it if you have to get in a fight in real life. 

Does your gym have any other teachers? If you’re sensitive (and I don’t mean that in a bad way, I am too from also having shitty, yelling parents), and the teacher tends to be harsh or mean, maybe try with another teacher or gym. This should be a positive experience. I’m lucky to have found a super nice teacher with a great sense of humor & I’m excited for class every time. I know he has my back."

limerence,feiofsx,t1_feibdrt,1579143284.0,"Same. This is gonna sound narcissistic as hell but it’s objectively true - I’m attractive (people always telling me I should model), nice, funny, independent, adventurous, in shape. I actually truly don’t get it. And I worry that the older I get, the more it comes off as a “red flag” that I’m single as hell and have been for 5 years."
limerence,feio6ri,t1_fehqgq5,1579143117.0,"26F dealing since 15 too. Just had an LO quickly say hi walk out of a bar a minute after I got there. If he was interested at all, he would have stuck around for even just a quick convo. I feel dead inside but it’s a big sign that it’s time to move on. I want to post about it in this sub but friends follow me and I don’t have the energy to make a throwaway.

I will say that as I’ve gotten older, my limerence has gotten clearer. A big realization was that people should be in a relationship with someone that makes them feel good. Period. So the fact that the LO can make us feel like absolute trash by not giving us attention not only is a sign that they’re not “the one”, but also shows that limerence is more about us and our self-esteem than them. We should not feel less than if a certain person doesn’t give us attention. Easier said than done for those with limerence of course. Our brains LOVE telling us otherwise. Maybe our brains have limerence for US? 😜

Hope this helps, guys. I do actually see a light at the end of the tunnel- a life where I’m over this shit. But still have a ways to go. Best of luck."

Although sometimes crushes can die out quickly... but also, if those crushes were to ask me out, I’d prob still say yes. 🤷🏽‍♀️ I guess it can depend? Idk.

Good luck with things!"
AppalachianTrail,fdx61ia,t1_fdw4p4y,1578765645.0,"Thanks so much for your detailed response! All of this advice/info is great. I think that’s a good idea to try one night first, and maybe I should think about after April... I’m just so anxious to try it, haha! 

And I definitely will be bringing a book, I barely go anywhere without one 😌"

limerence,fdw4lhd,t1_fdtohyd,1578754981.0,"Might need to confess some of your feelings and tell her you need time apart while you get over your crush. That will prevent her feelings from being hurt. 

Or you can do what I did, ask “what are we?” when you’re drunk and run away when they say “we’re just friends” and then pretend that nothing happened even though it crushes your soul every time they’re around. And then confess to a mutual friend months later to them saying “you’re still not over that?” and get crushed all over again in a different way. 😅

Jk, don’t do the latter! Good luck."
ENFP,fdw31ks,t1_fdu14l1,1578754558.0,"That’s true. I guess I keep holding on to the idea of being an expert of something, so people say “oh OP is good at that, hit her up for help!” But I guess that doesn’t matter nor is part of my personality. Perhaps I’m more of a “semi-jack of a lot of trades”.

Thanks!"
ENFP,fdw2g8n,t1_fduvnck,1578754331.0,"Whenever you think something would be cool, just go out and do it before you lose the desire.

Remember that this is the way your depression/anxiety manifested, and this sub is greet for this specific one, but other peoples’ manifest in many other ways. You are so, so not alone! For a bright side- at least this one hasn’t harmed your health (I.e. alcohol or drug addiction).

In terms of money, the best thing for me has been to fall in love with budgeting. It becomes a new lifestyle. I paid off $18k of CC debt in 6 months. Try posting your financial situation in r/personalfinance and/or r/YNAB if you’d like some help.

Best of luck! Xo"

I’m fine to listen, console, empathize with others plenty, but when it comes to myself, I can only really open up to a select few. And even then I find myself still being careful with what I say."
