starbucks,fk5tvqk,t3_fgmh3j,1583887781.0,$13 and some change was the most expensive drink that I’ve seen
marriageadvice,fk5tmoz,t3_fgo1f8,1583887647.0,"A husband here. 
There’s some things that I’m into that my wife doesn’t like and won’t let me do. None of it is as extreme as pegging, not judging just saying my desires aren’t that, but still I stay loyal. There’s either new positions or certain things I want to do that she doesn’t like and I respect that. Not gunna lie sometimes I wish that she would let me do it with her but she doesn’t like that and I love her for her not her body. My marriage is no where near 15 years yet and I’m also young but I’m just speaking from a husbands point of view that he should respect if you don’t want to do something that you aren’t comfortable with. And if he’s petty enough to go cheat on you so he can have it done to him then just remember you would deserve better than that anyway."
starbucks,fk5k6x4,t3_fgjett,1583882191.0,My go to question is asking how their day is or asking if they have any plans for the day. Asking their plans usually makes a longer conversation unless they vent about their day.
starbucks,fk5j4bm,t1_fk56xzc,1583881557.0,Mozzy’s one of my favorite rappers that’s great lol is he nice in person?
starbucks,fk5iypo,t3_fgl884,1583881463.0,Y’all get floor mats?
marriageadvice,fk5h9vk,t1_fk52f63,1583880468.0,Honestly sometimes yes. Not always but sometimes it’s like “why did you marry me if you could do that to me??” She’s changed but my heart is stuck in the past and i hate it
starbucks,fk517sb,t3_fg7vs5,1583871522.0,I work in a city that isn’t exactly full of nice people and yet we still don’t have bathroom codes. Doesn’t make sense to me because my area also has a lot of tweakers at night
mentalillness,fk50orl,t3_fg93gr,1583871240.0,"You should be able to have friends even if they’re guys. My wife has guy friends and me personally I don’t have a lot of girl friends but if I did she wouldn’t care because you need to be able to trust your partner. 
Personally I’m having marriage issues because of my insecurities so that probably ruins my credibility, but one thing I’m not insecure about is if my wife is friends with a guy. I don’t mind it as long as he respects the relationship. 
Communicate with your partner it isn’t good to just let everything go because then eventually hate and resentment build up then one huge fight can happen and end it all. If you’re really just trying to make friends and there’s no other motive then I’m not sure why he’d be mad unless maybe he feels insecure about which is why you guys should talk."
starbucks,fk4zr8u,t3_fgicpj,1583870730.0,Wait what? Jesus Christ lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,fk4z7g5,t3_fgh0em,1583870428.0,No matter what people will never get along because humans apparently can’t grasp the fact that it’s okay to respect others. 🤦🏻‍♂️
marriageadvice,fk4yxhs,t1_fk4p5h4,1583870277.0,When we were dating early on in the relationship she wasn’t loyal. According to her she did nothing else physical but i don’t know because she was texting guys and sending pics and flirting. It was a long time ago but still it made it hard for me to trust her
starbucks,fk4j1b0,t3_fgfljo,1583861418.0,Love me some dishwater
starbucks,fk4j0sv,t3_fgfljo,1583861410.0,My favorite drink
marriageadvice,fk4iasd,t1_fk4i1wy,1583861004.0,"No worries I would be the same way if someone did something to me and played the victim. I don’t like that and I’m sorry to hear you’re going through that. 
Thank you for the advice. I just hope i don’t mess this up because she really is all that i want. I don’t want to lose her and I want to be happy with her and i know for a fact we can because we used to be there but my own issues and insecurities got our marriage off track."
starbucks,fk2d1fl,t3_fg1cdh,1583798321.0,I always joke around and it either annoys everyone or makes them laugh there is no in between.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fk1yd68,t1_fk1pqai,1583789332.0,Thank God 😅
marriageadvice,fk1ybg3,t1_fk1ny6v,1583789305.0,Thank you i really appreciate your feedback. I do want to change and I don’t like being this way I want to be happy and secure and regardless know that I’m enough. I hate the fact that i don’t love myself because i envy people who can look in the mirror and be content with what they see.
powerlifting,fk1jxov,t3_ffn4jj,1583781181.0,"Wendler’s 5/3/1 has worked wonders on my squat for me personally. It’s worked for everything but the focus here is squats. 
Also a problem I used to have with my squat was that I didn’t go deep enough and fixing it was just a matter of putting ego aside and getting the right depth."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fk1jcba,t3_ffx1fk,1583780839.0,He ain’t beat the case but thankfully he at least had the chance to do the race.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fk1ikbw,t3_ffxaky,1583780389.0,White boi here I’ve legit never been to sports clips am i failing?
marriageadvice,fk15oac,t1_fk0xao0,1583772912.0,What also bothers me is she doesn’t have me in her bio at all. She still has my last name as her last name but the only people who would know that’s significant are her family and friends. Now strangers see her page and think she’s single but then again her account is private so she picks and chooses who gets to follow her. Still bothers me tho
marriageadvice,fk15i94,t1_fk0xao0,1583772816.0,Yeah true. Snapchat is worse to me tho honestly. Pictures disappear usually and people choose which text they want to save so that app doesn’t help my trust issues but i remind myself that she’s had chances before and didn’t act on it so i just need to keep it to myself and try to strengthen my marriage.
starbucks,fk0nwld,t3_ffl4gn,1583762045.0,I have never dealt with this yet. That sounds like the highest level of stupidity a customer can be at Starbucks.
starbucks,fk0noxq,t1_fk02zk6,1583761891.0,Oh lord
starbucks,fk0nnb1,t3_ffoq3t,1583761858.0,Sunday’s are just crap. They’re hell. People get out of church and feel like they’ve earned the right to torture Starbucks workers and they can’t even give us the respect we deserve smh.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fk0ngs8,t3_ffoz09,1583761728.0,That’s why I just deleted social media. Too many people saying dumb shit and most of social media is just toxic and nothing but drama. I’ll stick to reddit because at least here I just see the funny stuff and not bs.
starbucks,fk0jq51,t1_fk099kh,1583758925.0,Maybe my store just needs to park more then. I’ve worked there since October of 2019 and we barely park unless it’s something like a couple of pour overs.
marriageadvice,fk00sra,t1_fk00n80,1583736608.0,"Yeah I’ve been thinking about therapy I guess I’m just either being lazy or running from my problems. It really needs to be faced though or I’m going to lose my wife. 
May I ask if life has been better without social media? Do you feel happier?"
starbucks,fk00po5,t1_fjyw2mg,1583736505.0,I feel like customers do huge orders on drive thru on purpose because they know it’ll get done quicker. But what they don’t know is how it ruins times and makes drive thru worse.
starbucks,fjzr2sn,t3_ffkevi,1583726813.0,I understand that! Today i was on drive my whole shift and i swear to God there wasn’t one moment where we had a calm shift. I’d take an order they’d pull up then the ding would go off again. Back to back to back. And yeah hella people did add on today it gets annoying because they should be ordering where they’re supposed to be.
starbucks,fjzquci,t1_fjz231l,1583726622.0,I wouldn’t doubt that. It’s just obnoxious because i noticed it’s also older people who should know how to respect others
bodybuilding,fjyx4x5,t1_fjxxbrc,1583706464.0,True
bodybuilding,fjx1ti4,t1_fjwxsfw,1583652913.0,Oh hell yeah he would. Bodybuilding has changed over the years and nowadays i feel like size is a big category in winning when in Arnold’s time they were looking for something more along the lines of him. He definitely wasn’t small but he definitely wasn’t a mass monster.
bodybuilding,fjx1opy,t1_fjuvhbk,1583652745.0,Best comment lol
starbucks,fjwr58u,t3_fekv58,1583643645.0,It irritates me so much and it makes me even madder when they have the NERVE to give me attitude for asking 2-3 times what they’re saying.
starbucks,fjpoeok,t1_fjpgcsz,1583556416.0,"Yeah and they won the argument and I lost because ya know the customer is always right it just doesn’t make sense to me that people can’t respect rules. It literally says it ends at 7pm on the app. But apparently because they sat in drive-thru 2 minutes after 7pm they feel like they should get it. I would understand if they’ve been sitting since 6:50pm, but 7:02pm just doesn’t make any sense."
mentalillness,fjlovb6,t1_fjl7xne,1583451109.0,I appreciate the advice
mentalillness,fjl5nzz,t1_fjk24rr,1583440404.0,My wife is a really great person and I’m so blessed that I have her so honestly I disgust myself sometimes when I even think she would do something hurtful to me. She just wants to see me grow and she’s had plenty of chances to cheat or leave and in one heated argument I even told her just go fuck someone else and she still stayed loyal and I know that was really toxic of me.. it’s not like I don’t see my wrong actions I know I was toxic I’m just doing my hardest not to do it again and to become healthy.
mentalillness,fjl5by4,t1_fjk24rr,1583440221.0,"I do have a CBD pen, a stizzy, and I smoke regular weed sometimes just not everyday. Those seem to calm me down a little because alcohol makes all of my thoughts even worse. 
As for vitamins and stuff I don’t know what I should be taking to help. I’ll look into magnesium though, thank you."
starbucks,fjl5023,t1_fjjmrh8,1583440041.0,Wish i could protect all the workers but sadly I’m one dude lmao

BlackPeopleTwitter,fjite5k,t1_fjirr37,1583375308.0,They seriously called that vandalism?
starbucks,fjijtyb,t1_fjfic1w,1583369219.0,I noticed they have a lot of carbs and sugar. Good on a leg day but any other day I just usually get one of the breakfast sandwiches without the bread on break.
starbucks,fji3zm9,t3_fdi8gd,1583360221.0,Honestly when I see stuff like this it makes me worry for female workers. I can’t relate because I’m a guy and I’m also pretty big so if a customer tried to get weird with me outside of work I could just drop em’. Carrying pepper spray or just something for self defense would be what I recommend.
starbucks,fji39uw,t3_fdha7c,1583359892.0,That’s some horrible parenting right there. Wouldn’t even want to meet the parents.
starbucks,fjd5f8s,t1_fjc3xou,1583246073.0,How was it?
starbucks,fjc1vv3,t3_fcmnco,1583206500.0,Tat. It’s kind of a word. That makes sense because I have 3 tattoos and still want more lol.
starbucks,fjc1a3d,t3_fcl8ze,1583206081.0,I’ve noticed that the rudest customers really do have the most basic names lol I have never seen someone with a unique name be rude to me at work.
starbucks,fjbllcl,t1_fjbeosw,1583196051.0,Oof I’m NorCal
mentalillness,fjb6o2s,t3_fc6i0z,1583187549.0,Can you take the dog with you to your mom’s?
starbucks,fjb66z6,t3_fcir1l,1583187277.0,Are we talking old fashioned send mail or just exchange social media’s lol. I’m from Cali tho
starbucks,fjb5x5x,t3_fcjsws,1583187122.0,Cali here and make $13.02 an hour as a barista.
starbucks,fja52we,t3_fcefmq,1583166555.0,If you’re busy and can’t make your way back fast enough ask a partner through the headset if they remember what it was or just do your best to repeat it to yourself.
starbucks,fja4xdc,t3_fcefmq,1583166464.0,"I’m still fairly new because I just started in October of 2019, but basically the ONLY place they ever put me is drive thru. It gets frustrating because I want to do more than just that and want to learn more drinks but I’m just like it is what it is and try to practice drinks when it’s slow and hardly anyone is there. Anyway a tip I have for multitasking is when it comes to food tell the customer that you’re going to check and see if you have that food item for them, even if you know for a fact that you do, because then you can throw it in the oven or grab it while they think that you’re just looking for it. 
Another thing I do is if I’m getting something from the back and they’re ordering I’ll walk back to drive thru really quickly and as I’m walking just repeat their drink to them and clarify so I can type it in as they respond."
starbucks,fj9wxet,t1_fj9wqes,1583161527.0,Is it tough working those night shifts?
starbucks,fj9wpd9,t1_fj9whqc,1583161379.0,"Oh that does make sense now. Sorry to hear that I know how it is having to bite your tongue at work. Sometimes it makes me question if I just want to do what I want to do in retaliation but then I would most likely get fired lol. 
I don’t understand rude customers I really think there’s something wrong with their brain or they were raised wrong."
starbucks,fj9w8w2,t1_fj9vrf6,1583161076.0,That doesn’t make sense because personally I’m going through some issues with my family and they vandalized my vehicle outside of Starbucks because of assumptions they made and now they’re banned from my work. They even threw a fit when they got kicked out. So either my sm is just really nice to me or somebody’s lying to you.
starbucks,fj9volu,t1_fj9scut,1583160701.0,They have 24 hour Starbucks???
starbucks,fj9vloc,t1_fj9m703,1583160647.0,You should be fine then just make sure to go about it the right way and give a two week notice.
starbucks,fj91l3t,t3_fc62gq,1583128778.0,"I guess it would depend on how many other workers there are too. If you guys are understaffed and your manager is having that surgery then I can see why you would feel bad. If you aren’t understaffed then you just have to remind yourself that somethings are not for everyone and that’s okay at least you’re honest about it. 
I’ve never been fired and I’ve quit all of my previous jobs. Personally I have never put in a 2 week notice and I’ve felt bad about that fact but the reason is because each time I had to quit was due to an extreme situation that I was in so I had to leave ASAP. If you aren’t in an emergency I would recommend a 2 week notice. It’s the right thing to do and at least you aren’t just up and leaving and not showing up ever again. Leaving on good terms is better. Looks good on you and doesn’t mess up your dependability as much as just dipping would."
mentalillness,fj91b5e,t1_fj90z6c,1583128505.0,I’m not on meds because I’m scared to try them I’ve heard of bad side effects coming from them. I haven’t told anyone yet.
starbucks,fj11nnb,t3_faltue,1582911447.0,"I’m actually trying headspace and it’s alright but I can’t grasp how they expect an app to cure mental illness. 
With everything I’ve been through i honestly don’t even think professional counseling would put a dent in helping me."
starbucks,fitv3kf,t1_fitb0py,1582730039.0,I’d say that depends on the store though. Because I’ve said no to a call in once due to a legitimate reason and not being lazy and they just got mad and cut my hours the next week. Then they got sarcastic and said well you can come in at a later time for your shift then since you need time for your homework. I just ignore it if I can’t do it and if I can I reply. I’ve taken 3 out of 4 so I think I’m alright.
starbucks,fitujph,t3_f9lltt,1582729707.0,Okay but I have a horrible relationship with my family so I don’t think that would be a good thing lmfao.
