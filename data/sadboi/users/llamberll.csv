It just sucks feeling like I have to try to find all of these answers by myself, while going to a professional that I was hoping would give me answers and help me.

I see 4 decisions that I took that made me late today:

1. I procrastinated getting ready to leave home. I planned on arriving there 3 hours early to make sure, and having lunch around there before I went waited a bit and went in. Then it felt like too much when the time came, so I thought 2 hours would be enough. Then came problem 2...

2. I wanted to print out an exercise to take to the appointment, which was a journal about some things we’re working on. I could have done it yesterday, but I procrastinated thinking that since I wasn’t going to sleep there would be plenty of time to do it. I did it just before leaving home, and It took longer than I expected, but I wanted to do a good job on it instead of rushing it.

3. I had something I needed to do before going to the appointment, which also a little bit longer than I was expecting.

4. There are two ways I can take to go there. I usually take one that is twice as long, but there’s little traffic and I can rush there if I have to. We’re working on my reckless driving in our sessions, so I decided to take the shorter way which I wouldn’t be able to speed. Google maps was saying that I would be there just in time, but I ended taking 10 min longer than I expected in traffic.

—  —  — 

I just don’t know what to make of this. All I can think of is that it’s my fault, that I’m not being serious about therapy, that I’m not good enough... and other inner critic attacks.

Now I’m doubting her abilities to help me, and wondering if I deserve to be helped at all..."

I don’t know which stage of recovery the OP is, or anyone who’s reading this. But what I’m basically reading some people comment is “I try not to think too much about it”, or “I just see them as messed up and try not to over analyze”.

This is the denial I’m talking about, and I believe it just leaves you stuck in your situation.    
I believe the right thing to do is try to understand what’s happening. Try to understand what they’ve done to you, why they did it, and what are the negative consequences of it. Then the next step would be seeking help to try to undo the mess.

The first book that got me started into narcissism and emotional abuse was a fairly simple one, but it was very kind and it provided some important knowledge and tools for me to be able to escape the abuse.

It describes the 6 steps of recovery: despair, education, awakening, boundaries, restoration and maintenance.    
By being in denial I feel like you’re just deviating from the recovery journey on the first step. You feel despair, but don’t want to deal with it — or don’t know how.

This was just the first step of course. I then started to gather more resources like [Assertiveness](https://www.audible.com/pd/When-I-Say-No-I-Feel-Guilty-Audiobook/B01LXDHJSC?qid=1580169284&sr=1-1&pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf_rd_r=6Y6437PDKXB0C17XFKDY&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1), and went on to describe in more detail the story of what was done to me and what my developmental deficits really were. I did this by searching articles, videos, books and seeing therapists.    
Another good source is a [CPTSD book by Pete Walker](https://www.audible.com/pd/Complex-PTSD-Audiobook/B07MCYF4FF?qid=1580169440&sr=1-2&pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf_rd_r=5S5XBW6WM6CAPJS1PACE&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_2), if you don’t know it yet.    
You will probably also find the work of Alice Miller mentioned along the way, if you chose to go through this kind of recovery, so [here’s a source](https://www.audible.com/pd/When-I-Say-No-I-Feel-Guilty-Audiobook/B01LXDHJSC?qid=1580169284&sr=1-1&pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf_rd_r=6Y6437PDKXB0C17XFKDY&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1)

I’m glad to be seeing a therapist who finally validates me, and who I feel I can openly discuss this with.

Being alone with this is awful. Now I get all the advice about reaching out.

I feel like I’ve jumped down a hole on my first appointment 10 years ago, and that I’m still falling.

One resource that really helped me was learning about [assertiveness](https://www.audible.com/pd/When-I-Say-No-I-Feel-Guilty-Audiobook/B01LXDHJSC?qid=1579851741&sr=1-1&pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf_rd_r=BXHY69DW5QG96ASNVKR9&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1).

Another one was learning and dealing with my [C-PTSD](https://www.audible.com/pd/Complex-PTSD-Audiobook/B07MCYF4FF?qid=1579851446&sr=1-2&pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf_rd_r=Q68MHJ3BRQ0JVAK05HWE&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_2).

And also learning about attachment styles, [parental neglect](https://youtu.be/kLjD7wsDq3E) and overcompensation to try to feel accepted.

I don’t think I’ve found the answer, as I’m in a movement of continuing isolation. But I guess at least I don’t feel like shit anymore for trying and not being able to give 100% of myself to others.

I hope these help, and I hope you find a way to deal with this. I know how much it sucks to punish yourself while taking responsibility for others’ experiences, and to feel like you’re the problem."
CPTSD,ffek9nw,t3_et3k6t,1579851534.0,"Do you feel guilty about feeling this anger?

It might help to try to accept this feeling. The very fact that you feel it is enough to validate it. Sometimes our feelings have real sources, even if we can’t or won’t allow ourselves to see them.

I’m sorry that I can’t provide more specific resources.    
Kati Morton usually talks about this in some of her videos on her youtube channel, like [this one](https://youtu.be/jABdK4-TGrY).
Pete Walker also has some advice about this on his [book about CPTSD](https://www.audible.com/pd/Complex-PTSD-Audiobook/B07MCYF4FF?qid=1579851446&sr=1-2&pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&pf_rd_r=Q68MHJ3BRQ0JVAK05HWE&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_2).

I’d like to apologize if the way I’m expressing myself may seem aggressive, as it’s not my intention at all. I’m working to become more assertive.

I was taken by what you said, about how to view the behaviors of the abused.    
I tend to criticize others for abusive behavior, but I often struggle with an inner critic that won’t allow me to forgive myself for behaving in certain ways, even when I feel like I don’t have the strength be more kind to others while I recover.    
I’m not sure if what you meant was along those lines. It’s just nice to have a different point of view from the guilt and perfectionist attacks I put myself through, and to flirt with the idea of cutting myself some slack.
It might sound selfish and like I’m lacking empathy to excuse some anti-social behaviors in myself, but it might just be beneficial to allow it for a while.

Sorry for the rant, I guess I just needed to vent and sort out some ideas."
BodyDysmorphia,ffehqvt,t3_et5iar,1579848490.0,"I don’t understand why you’re correlating your insomnia with your body dysmorphia.

I too have a terrible insomnia problem. I also have Cptsd for similar reasons, and take medication to help me sleep.

I don’t associate my body image with my insomnia, at least not at night when I’m ruminating. But I guess it could be?

I would like to know more about how you made this connection between your body self image and your insomnia."
BodyDysmorphia,ffehf1a,t3_et5iar,1579848118.0,"And it’s true, isn’t it?

At least when it comes to obesity. I get the current body positivity movement, to have us accept ourselves and not crush our self esteem when feeling like shit about our bodies. But I see obesity and bulimia as terrible, soul crushing diseases. 

Sometimes I feel like not seeing them that way and perpetuating “body positivity” is just sugar coating a very destructive condition.

We are fat, and it sucks. We are stigmatized and looked down upon because of it. We develop horrendous coping mechanisms because of it, perpetuating the vicious cycle of self hate and low self worth.

Yes, it hurts. But I feel like being in denial about this problem is worse in the long term.

I’m sorry for the rant. I get that not being able to accept compliments can hurt, and it seems like you’re dealing with quite a bit right now.

CPTSD,ffegv6j,t3_eszs4s,1579847500.0,"I empathize with feeling like a child and wanting to be nurtured. And I also feel embarrassed and stupid for it.

I feel like I have a very low threshold for this, and feel like any kind of self disclosure is over sharing.

That’s the current stage I am in recovery, learning to accept and validate my feelings and my story.

I still struggle with isolation and trusting people, so I basically only have my therapist to feel like I’m oversharing stuff with. But I think being able to vent and communicate your feelings to someone is an important ability to recover, or discover."
CPTSD,ffeg5zb,t1_feoosif,1579846736.0,"You can justify and think that their behavior is what they were thought, or that it comes from a traumatic upbringing. But I’m not sure if the self doubt and guilt that comes along is worth it.

Rationalizing sucks."
CPTSD,ffeg0gc,t1_feolykt,1579846571.0,"Still I think our behavior is a choice. 

You could argue that people behave how they were thought. I prefer to see it as abuse, and a choice to abuse as long as they are not willing to question their hurtful behavior.

I may be projecting empathy. I’ve learned quite a few passive aggressive and hurtful behaviors from my family, but I have questioned and managed to change them many times.

At the risk of falling into pitfalls, I believe that as long as we are willing to see this kind of hurtful behavior as anything other than a choice to behave this way, we are tolerating abuse."
