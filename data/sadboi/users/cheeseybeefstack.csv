Sorry that some random guy misgendered you and ruined your day. “Try not to let it bother you” is some pretty tough advice to internalize, so I won’t even go down that road. Sometimes it just feels like we’re all hangin’ on by a thread. 
Just wanted to comment, and say you’re probably awesome, and that when you share stories like this you make people feel less alone."
bipolar,euy57ax,t3_chrguf,1564095709.0,This is gorgeous and horrific. Exactly how I feel when trying to sleep. Trying new drugs tonight. Maybe that monster will let me go?
ambien,eupg25k,t3_cgwrn5,1563956541.0,"I read that it’s “relatively safe” (non-lethal”) up into slightly higher tolerances. There are other sleep aids to try, or even just anti anxiety meds. You may find that some kind of pharmacological crop rotation keeps you effective with lower doses, or that some underlying system needs help/improvement to solve the sleep issue.
Of course, you could also contact Alex Jones to see if interdimensional aliens really did come and whisk you off to another plane of existence that first time. Anything else would just be a little reminiscent nibble compared to the first feast of brain blasting splendor.
Good luck, comrade."
ambien,eupf64o,t3_ch4ymg,1563956157.0,"I literally just woke up from an ambi-nap! I used the drug once while traveling, and found it to work well for brief periods of semi-restful sleep, although I definitely had some anger issues. Triggers were more genuinely things that made me angry though- like little pet peeves that I would normally be able to brush off but that somehow seemed more personal to me on ambien. Don’t know.
Here’s the bad news- I’m a lifetime insomniac (the likes of which most commenters probably could not fathom)- and I have recently been diagnosed as a bipolar schizophrenic. The only major symptoms that interrupt my life are the sleeplessness, racing thoughts, and this kind of accompanying anger... so you may want to check that out.
About to take the evening’s 3rd dose of ambien and Klonopin to get a few more hours in before work tomorrow.
Best of luck!"
bipolar,eulm4c0,t3_cgvj1f,1563903365.0,"First of all, that’s a sweet leopard. Second, yeah- I f*cking manic’d out and went to China for a few months. One of the best things I’ve ever done."
bipolar,eullx5q,t3_cgrxmm,1563903243.0,"Yeah homie! Don’t feel “pressure” to feel happy. Who knows why you’re sad. Just a genuine example/possibility I can relate to: “things are good now, which makes me understand even more how/why they weren’t good before.”
Anyway... yeah! Talk about it. Write about it. Congratulations on your progress. Also, “celebrating” isn’t really necessary. I think what you want to work towards is some pride, and the ability (which requires practice) to see yourself as successful and moving forward."
bipolar,eullhqd,t3_cgtes4,1563902985.0,"I f*cking hook up some jumper cables to my brains nuts, either by working out hard, sleeping less, getting into a fight, or eating less.
Then again, I’m, like, unable to escape mania with anything other than fistfuls of benzos and haven’t slept more than two consecutive hours in about a decade.
Working on it now with meds (boo) and therapy (eh).
You trying to trigger it on purpose?"
bipolar,eulkw10,t3_cgmez8,1563902623.0,This is ingenious

Amen, friends. All I have to say is A-goddamn-men.
Best of luck to you all in the gathering storm.
Strength and honor."
r4r,erwms2b,t3_c4dh8g,1561348483.0,You just charmed my face off of my face. I’m going to be thinking about this next time I buy lettuce.
CPTSD,eqduybn,t3_bguy8v,1559995403.0,"Hi, I think like most of the commenters here, I was the child of depressed parents. I have lots of thoughts on this, but they center on this: being a good parent is about empowering your child to be happy, which requires breaking the cycle of shittiness that you inherited.
The fact that you are concerned about how your behavior affects your child is already a HUGE asset. A bad parent doesn’t care. Thus, you are already a good parent. My opinion is that a successful parent is one whose child is happy, and I think the most effective way to achieve that is to lead by example.
Happy to discuss this further or to clarify. 
Good luck, OP. You are already heroic for caring about your child’s wellbeing. We are all lost souls. We save ourselves to save those who need us!"
