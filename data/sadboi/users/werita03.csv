S. resident or citizen looks like I need to file as single.
We still don't have the ITIN for my husband, as the process will begin next year, but if either way I'm a nonresident alien,and he is also, what is the point of the ITIN, if I can't file married?
We indeed don't have children, but my husband qualifies as my dependant because he is not working, or am I getting it wrong? Of what I've seen in the W4 form.. It looks like he would qualify for me to at least add an allowance."

cookingforbeginners,f9ebo7h,t3_e4hmf3,1575241972.0,"I make pizza out of flour ""Mexican"" tortillas, and they taste delicious. You can make them using a pan.

You need:
- Flour tortillas (depending on the size I normally eat 1 to 1 1/2 burrito size tortilla)
- 1 small box of tomato sauce. Can be ragu or just plain tomato sauce, it works well. I buy 'La Costeña' just because I'm Mexican and that's a branch I'm used to. 1 box can make 4 burrito size flour tortilla pizza. 
- Cheese blend. Whatever you like. I like the shredded cheese packages they sell in bags, normally there's Colby jack or mozzarella with cheddar mixed, whatever, just be sure is the melting type of cheese. 
- Pepperoni slices, or ham, or whatever you want as toppings. 

In a pan, in medium heat, when the tortilla is cooked (warm enough), pour tomato sauce in there and expand it with a spoon. Then add the cheese mix and place the toppings. I would recommend putting a lid for ~1 minute, until you see the cheese has melted. 

After that just take it out and cut it like a pizza with a knife. You can add parmesan or whatever toppings you like. 

It's easy, cheap and I personally like it a lot."

Will my parents keep saving the boxes of the stuff I left out when moving into my new house, and if I leave the country, there will be more! What will they say?
