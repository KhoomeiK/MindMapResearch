schizoaffective,fp3jpzy,t1_fp3axot,1588280502.0,I know people that have to microdose 5 mg to people on 600 mg per day. The best advise I‚Äôve heard is to try to achieve the lowest dose that makes you stable. If 200 mg is doing you good keep at it and then ask to go to 150 mg and see how that feels. Once you feel stable you can start comparing symptoms and side effects. Do it supervised under an MD for safety reasons. But also let‚Äôs say you have an episode the MD can save you from 5150 and let you do a out patient treatment. I really hope the meds work for you and bring peace to your mind.
