I won’t meet friends at the grocery store and I won’t meet a life partner by walking around the block. I don’t drink and have a child to take care of, so bars are definitely out of the question. What then? 

I guess the solution is just to hit and miss until something comes up. That’s how my friends met me after all. They told me nonsense that was barely better than “nice shirt...”, yet they’re still around. Being socially proactive (not going from introvert to extrovert). Facing rejection, from people who don’t matter, until we meet someone who does. Rolling the dice, so to speak.

I’m just just pushing through towards my goal. That guy looking at you weird, what is he gonna do? kill you? He’s gonna have the law on his back. Talk about win-win! You said you didn’t kill yourself because of your family. That’s good, most people can’t think of a reason why they don’t do it. Spend time with them, they ARE your source of meaning for now. Figure out theirs and invest the time you can towards making their lives better. Hopefully your source of meaning should outlive you, but start with what you have and build up from there. 

I was on the same boat, in a way. I know what what all those things feel like and when she died I was resentful of being alive. I stuck for my daughter, but I had a lot of doubts whether I would do a better job raising her than any alternatives. However, some wisdom I keep coming across, whether it be through psychology, philosophy, spirituality, religions, music, is that only the struggle matters. Life is a struggle, but it’s by taking the struggle seriously and enjoying every second, every bit of progress towards your goal that makes it good. 

Set goals, make plans, take action, be reckless, take things seriously. I don’t believe in destiny and would never allow myself to, but look out for omens (signs of fate). By which I mean, when something happens, give it a reason. I live my life by that motto: Everything happens, give it a reason. I think it’s way better than the original “everything happens for a reason” which is the most useless, nonsensical platitude people regurgitate.

I hope this helps. Take care,

That’s a good feeling. For the feeling of accomplishment is transitory, but having a purpose, that lasts until you achieve your goal. You may think: “then what? I strive for something else?” Precisely! Life is for the present, the struggle, the pain it implies. It’s not for a set of highlights, ups and downs. Just start with a goal you believe you can achieve, let’s say cleaning up your place. That’s where I start when in a rut. It takes about 15-30min, but I expect it to take hours every time.

Figure out what factors matter most to you (taste, efficiency, completeness...)

Look for guidelines by keeping in mind that they are no more than that (food guides, helpful tips, recommendations...)

Remember to cycle it and find ways to determine what’s next (making a calendar, following seasonal crops, looking for sales at the grocery store...)

Try to add novelty before you know how to cook them, instead of buying what’s familiar. That’s gonna keep you on your feet when you cook these and it may inspire you to learn more. (fermented food, rare crops, things that catch you eyes but never buy...)

Learn something new (making vinaigrettes is easy. The same goes for sauce. Fermenting is a bit tricky, but if you start from the beginning it goes smoothly)

Most importantly, learn to take it seriously. That’s where fun comes from and this applies to everything. When you eat meat, you may feel committed to cook this animal well. When you cook something pricey, you’ll want to use the right quantities and to have the proper side to go with it. Learn about oils to know which go where.

books,fhp4bd2,t3_f4agfc,1581781593.0,"Well, I’m currently reading a pretty complicated book and felt proud of the speed at which I was reading, so I did the math and found out I was reading at 74 wpm. That’s not something to be proud of, given that the average is 200 words, however I am 12% through this book according to GoodRead and I started pretty recently. That’s all about what you get from reading. The average is 200 wpm, but I doubt that the average is the “91% comprehension” that you obtained. Are you growing from your reading? Are you entertained while you read? As you read, your speed will surely increase, for now focus on keeping your comprehension from decreasing. I only use speed reading to review what I already read at a slower pace."

I stumbled on an old man who read 1000 books and had 1000 in his “to-read” shelf and his reviews are thorough and insightful. It makes me feel less desperate about reading all the books I aspire to read to see that. Truly better than any social media!"
Jung,fhkalt6,t1_fhjjky1,1581675051.0,"I have a hypothesis as to why drawings are frowned upon. If I remember correctly, those are drawings of Mohamed, the prophet, not god. I think the reason it is forbidden to make pictures of the prophet is the same than why Christian are forbidden to worship statues (false idols). The reason being that this would replace the message of religion is trying to convey and replace it with those who shared it. I think that is why there is a difference between Sunni and Shia Islam, protestantism, catholicism and orthodox christianity and so on. It’s people according more value to who said it, who preaches it than to what was said/preached."

Wow, that’s pretty close to how I would describe myself. Basically I don’t believe in a supernatural being looking over us, but I try to look more deeply into the non-dual perspective of existence/consciousness, while taking a deep interest into Sartre with his notion of authenticity and Nietzsche with the concept of self-overcoming."
Jung,fhisg2f,t3_f3gdtt,1581630911.0,"The modern idea of God and religion make no sense, so it is unfair to blame them. We almost need a new word for each. One of my friend who calls himself an atheist gets very crept put when I mention a religious idea/wisdom, but claims to look for spirituality “in nature” instead, which is basically pantheism if I understand that concept properly. Just like The Stoics referred either to God or Nature bring firth ideas that are common to Taoism. That being said, I have just discovered these insights very recently, after a pretty rough 2019 which forced me to grow.

Also, those concepts are not yet fully clear to me and try constantly to understand them better."
books,fheyxid,t3_f2tgai,1581532764.0,"I didn’t want to read any of the books assigned at school. To be fair, most of them sucked. However, I had to read the first book of a series of four, which are the based on the Arthurian tales (It was called Graal, which is French for the Holy Grail). A month later I had finished the series. Today I have a letter-bound anthology of the Arthurian tales by Sir Thomas Malory."
books,fhexzi3,t3_f2uwjv,1581532199.0,"The Wisdom of Insecurity is great. If someone decided to go with The Way of Zen, though, I recommend they treat the two parts without prioritizing the first one before starting the second. Otherwise, one may feel like they will never learn anything practical about Zen. The first part is quite long-winded and I often wondered what I had read after a paragraph or page. I barely remember the first part, did not finish it, yet spent way more time reading it, without any enjoyment, than the second part. Still, the second part is absolutely worth it.Of course, one should read the first few chapters in order to know “what zen is”, which is very different from the western appropriation of the term to describe calmness. Zen not a religion or a philosophy, but a spiritual set of practice and wisdom, also called a way of liberation. That is despite being a school of buddhism bearing much resemblance to taoism. 

Next, I will read Buddhism: Religion of no Religion"
books,fhcj3k4,t1_fhcgm60,1581463924.0,"If you want to get an “idea outside our world” you may like A Brave New World by Aldous Huxley or Red/Green/Blue Mars by Kin Stanley Robinson. Post-Apocalyptic, Metro 2033-5 by Dmitry Glukhovsky. However, I think a good book to start with is The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. 

Personally, though, I tried to base my books on my movie/tv interests for a while, but never felt like reading until I started exploring way different horizons. I had similar interests as yours, but nowadays I mostly read philosophy, spirituality, mythology and even poetry.

Books don’t have to be fiction to bring you to another world."
books,fhbxw7d,t3_f2dtxn,1581452191.0,"I have a main book and a side book that I try to read within a week (obviously it takes a few extra days or a whole extra week) , while I have a set of 5 daily wisdom books (Daily stoic, Tao Te Ching, Beyond good and Evil...) I also have an occasional book that I try to read over the course of a month. I also have other wisdom books that I dispersed around the place to read one bit at a time. 

Right now I know I will fail to read my main book within a week, because it is “The Master and His Emissary “ Expanded edition by Iain McGilcrist and I’m 8% through in 2 days."

books,fhbocbc,t1_fhay8ie,1581446421.0,"look for a genre or topic that you can easily take seriously and are interested in. Find a book with short chapters or subchapter so that whenever you lose interest you can easily finish to the next checkpoint or pick it up from the last. Books that I recommend in that style are The Heart to Start by David Kadavy and Turning Pro by Steven Pressfield. Both are short and have short subdivisions within them and are about ambition. If you’re interested in history, The Lessons of History by W. & A. Durant is quite short and has 12 chapters. If you’re interested in Fiction, it may sound silly, but Dracula by Bram Stoker is assembled as a set of short letters that form chapters. That or you could look into abridged books or Penguin’s Little Black Classics are about $1 each and are one short story. While quick reading is not the best way to appreciate a book, it’s a good way to look back at what you have read last time when you can’t resume from where you left off right away.  Those are my opinions on the matter."

So much can be learned only by changing one’s perspective of God from a Superbeing to something more akin to the Buddhist perception of The Buddha. In fact it’s Buddhism that pushed me to buy a Bible and Matthew 16 is my favourite so far, although I am just beginning. Interesting fact, at average reading speed, it takes 342 hours to read the Bible NKJV."
