I got my first serious relationship at 29. It was great! We broke up eventually last year, but now I've found someone new again and I feel happy. Even happy about breaking up with my first gf. It was a good learning experience, and through the pain I grew as a person. I was so afraid I would never find someone again and I never dated much in the first place. But the second girl I went on a date with after I felt good enough to get out there again, I really clicked with and we're together for almost 4 months now. 
Just telling you my story to illustrate that things can change very quickly and things you fear often don't come to pass, and sometimes when you look back after some time you think ""why did I worry so much about that?"" Looking back at my teens and 20s I feel like it was a bit of an awkward time anyway. I feel much better and more at ease with myself now.
That being said it is good that you take action, and do learn about what works and what doesn't.

Mindfulness,fjqlxof,t3_fe90p7,1583574856.0,"Aren't you being unnecessarily hard on yourself? There's a difference between neediness and legitimate needs that you have in a relationship. If your needs aren't being met, even when you've communicated them clearly, then it's time for you to re-evaluate this relationship.

If you have not yet communicated them clearly, then it is time to sit down for a talk and do so as soon as possible. You are not pathetic for needing affection and communication from your partner even when she's out of town. Everyone has different needs and not every person will be a good fit for you. Some people need a lot of affection, some can do without. Some people give it easily some people don't. And it's hard for people to change that. I don't know if she was always like that or if it has changed over the course of the relationship. If she was always like that it sounds like this person might not be such a great fit. She should be wanting to give you the affection you need. You say it's not her job to help you feel safe in the relationship. I disagree. I think that's pretty much the most important ""job"" in the relationship she has (and vice versa of course). Or at least, let's say the right person would be doing this automatically without it being a ""job"". If she used to be affectionate but no longer, then it's a sign that something is seriously wrong in your relationship. She is unhappy, or stressed, she might have ""lost the spark"", she might be seeing someone else.

Of course there may be things on your end that are exacerbating the situation. But the most obvious problem seems to be a distinct lack of open and honest communication about needs and an unwillingness to face to possible consequences of said communication (ie: if you indicate your needs and she indicates it's too much for her, you really need to break up with this person. Again this goes both ways of course. Do you know her needs? Do you feel like you are fulfilling your end of the relationship deal?).

Breaking up is scary and painful, but sometimes it is for the best and you have to trust that with time you will get over it. You being resentful and unsure of her love is an absolutely toxic situation to be in and will only hurt you (and probably her) more in the long run."

No context in any of pictures that tells me anything about what you like to do or where you like to go. No full body shots.

Sorry for perhaps trying to read too much into a picture but the pictures communicate ""low self esteem"" to me. And perhaps you do have low self esteem (or lower than you'd like), and that's ok.

The ocean cleanup has also published a response here:

[https://theoceancleanup.com/updates/the-ocean-cleanup-and-the-neuston/](https://theoceancleanup.com/updates/the-ocean-cleanup-and-the-neuston/)

and a response to the response from dr Helm.  
[http://www.deepseanews.com/2019/02/the-ocean-cleanup-struggles-to-prove-it-will-not-harm-sea-life/](http://www.deepseanews.com/2019/02/the-ocean-cleanup-struggles-to-prove-it-will-not-harm-sea-life/)  


I think it is good to mention the the Ocean Cleanup currently only has deployed a small prototype system in the ocean. The environmental impact asessment was produced (by an independent agency) only for that system and the whole point of a prototype is to determine problems and fix them before deploying on a large scale. There would be a new EIA for deployment of any larger system.

At least some of the Dr Helm's worries seem to be predicated on the idea that the cleanup systems would be permanently scooping up plastic and neustons from the gyres in the oceans, but the whole idea of the Interceptor is to prevent much of the plastic to reach the oceans in the first place. This would mean the systems in the ocean would be temporary and hopefully, even if large amounts of neuston would be killed, they would get a chance to repopulate.

At least on some points in her second response, Dr Helm seems intent on reading the worst possible intentions behind the words of Slat and the Ocean Cleanup, which I'm not really getting from that when I read it. 

I'm not saying the concerns aren't valid, but it also seems a bit too early to say anything about the actual impact any future large scale system will have. 

I do hope the OC and Dr Helm will open a more constructive dialogue about it, rather than firing tweets and articles at eachother."
HumansBeingBros,fjcicjg,t1_fjao4aa,1583221319.0,"From the article you linked:

>Here is one alternative solution: Place a modified design closer to  plastic sources—river mouths and bays—to catch plastic before it enters  the open ocean. Choose a place where it can be monitored and corrected  for environmental impact. It seems too great a risk to disrupt the whole  surface ocean ecosystem so severely, when it is also one we barely  know. The neuston is an alien world, as bizarre as it is beautiful. It’s  still possible to avoid destroying this strange ecosystem, wedged  between sea and sky.

And this is exactly what the Ocean Cleanup is doing with the Interceptor. So I feel it's a bit of a stretch to say the OC ""isn't all that great"". There is probably no one perfect solution to the issue but they are trying their best. If interceptors can be set up en masse, the need for systems on the oceans themselves might be limited to ""only"" cleaning up the existing garbage concentrations, and they would not be needed permanently (and hopefully this would minimize any disruption of ecosystems)."

I'm in a kind of similar-ish situation with the girl I'm dating. She's a very down-to-earth type which I really like actually, but she's also not very forthcoming with stating her feelings about me/us dating or giving compliments. But apart from that she does seem to be very interested in meeting regularly, cuddling, holding hands, kissing and sex so... I'm assuming she likes me ;) I'm not super overwhelmed with feelings for her myself, but I definitely like her a lot so I just try and sneak in some compliments and other verbal indications of my interest here and there and usually she will respond in kind. But admittedly I do kind of wish she would express it herself a little bit more as I enjoy hearing it as well as feeling it in action. We've been dating for almost 2 months btw.

A bra and dress don't just come off if you don't want them to (unless he's actually forcing you, and then we're getting into sexual assault territory, but it doesn't quite sound like that's what happened).

Then you ask him  ""what are we doing?"" What did you think you were doing?

I'm not defending the guy btw, he should have stopped when you pushed his hands away the first time and that should have been enough for him to understand that he was moving too fast. At that point (as the guy) I would definitely have said ""Ok we don't have to do anything you don't want to do!""

Just the smallest amount more than you did the week before. You have to start small but be very aware of how people react if you do this. Starting with a simple ""hit and run"" compliment instead of trying to start a conversation. Just give the compliment, they will probably answer something like ""oh thank you"" and you say ""you're welcome, I gotta get going, have a great day"" and move on. Most people will enjoy a compliment, even if you are a bit awkward.

Your feeling about yourself should not depend on having a partner or not (although I know that that is difficult, as it tends to be ""expected"" in society). I'm just saying you can get self confidence from other areas of your life, and that will spill over into dating too. If you go the gym 4-5 times a week and get in good shape (if you aren't already), I can almost guarantee this will make you feel more confident in general. If you put perhaps some more time and effort into cultivating friendships and doing some interesting activities, this can boost your confidence as well. Then you can definitely use some level of ""fake it until you make it"". Just don't overdo it. Not every girl is looking for a super-confident, super-experienced alpha-male. But if you are not comfortable in your own skin in general, that's gonna be a big hindrance. You are enough, all by yourself, flaws and all.

Many people can't be by themselves without distraction (from another person or a smartphone or whatever) for even 10 minutes. We feel we are ""missing out"", or just sitting and being is ""not enough"". We are restless and always seeking and craving something. But there are ways to start to cut through this. Some kind of meditation practice is probably the most obvious one (can be totally secular in nature).

You can't do anything ""until life happens"". Life happens constantly, whether you are alone or not. It's never happening in the future, it's always happening in the present.

It sounds like it might be very good for you to actually schedule some weeks really alone on this trip. Enjoy being on the road, perhaps spending time in nature. Bring some good books to read (hey, we all need some distraction), don't think too much. Look at the cloud in the sky, the bird in the tree or the sunlight hitting the water in the lake. Listen to the wind rustling the leaves or the drone of the city traffic. Smell the flower and taste a nice meal. Lots of life happening to experience and enjoy."

Why do I want to answer... well that is a good question. I guess I feel like I should be able to have some answer when someone asks me about why I'm interested in this subject (the person can see I'm reading about it) and then for me to tell me something about the subject, even if it's only a simple answer.

Objectively speaking Christianity itself is as much a cult as is Mormonism. The same can probably be said of Buddhism and all it's offshoots although (again, speaking from admittedly limited knowledge) it seems to my that Buddhism in general and Zen in particular are less ""religion"" and more philosophy.

btw google ""Dogen cult"" and pretty much the first and only thing you get back are posts made by you on Reddit.

I any case I'm not sure why I'm getting all these rather (passive) aggresive and confrontational reactions to my rather straight forward question.

What's so hard to understand? I want to say something that will enable me to get my idea or interest across to someone who is only casually interested in a topic that would surely require a great amount of explanation and reading to get across fully, just so I can have a normal conversation. I'm not trying to persuade anyone, I don't know how to make it more clear what kind of normal conversation I'm talking about when I've just literally sketched it out.

If you have a complex job, and someone asks you about it in a casual conversation, do you go and explain in great detail with lots of technical jargon about your job? Or do you say ""it cannot be described in words"" (or perhaps stay silent, hoping they will get the implication that mere words cannot express what you would say). Don't you think this would ""scare the person off""? Wouldn't you try to come up with a slightly more accessible (it's not about being ""socially acceptable"" or ""sanitizing"") way of talking about it? That does not seem weird to me at all. That's how normal people have conversations all the time.

But you mention one concrete thing at least, which is a ""desire to be rid of desire"". So Zen is somehow related to that idea? Of dealing with desire? (I am now role playing the hypothetical question-asking person on my scenario btw).

I understand the experience is different for each person, but there must also be overlap and similarities, or Zen would not be Zen."

Let's assume they are simply asking you out of polite interest in a normal casual conversation (and let's assume that they are at least somewhat intelligent and can have a basic conversation about philosophical matters), like this:

Person: So what book are you reading?

Me: Oh I'm reading Alan Watt's ""The Way of Zen""!

Person: oh cool. Do you find it interesting?

Me: Yes very much so!

Person: so what is Zen? It's some kind of religion right?

Me: .... uhhhh

Person: so why are you interested in it?

Me: well .... ehhhh... let me get back to you on that.

I understand it's not really possible to capture Zen truly with words but there must be something we can say in such a situation that approximates what it is we are doing when we study or practice Zen. Mentioning stuff like ""perfect nature, ever present"" or even ""enlightenment"" is going to ""scare off"" this person for sure.

I think these are all things to consider before even signing up to any dating site or app. But of course dating apps would be a good start. Of course people have bad experiences there, but people also have good experiences. At least it's a low treshold way to test the waters but be prepared for a lot of rejection (I don't know if you're a man or a woman btw so your experience might differ depending on gender).

I'm sure in the UK there are also agencies that will provide you with more tailored and personal matching services (for a fee of course).

approach some more intimate topics (not neccesarily talk about sex, but maybe things that might be a bit more related or leading into that. Anything a bit more exciting or intimate than just general friendly conversation.

teasing/joking: if you can work a bit of teasing into a conversation this will almost automatically make it flirty. Humour in general is great for making a conversation more flirty but avoid self-deprecating jokes. You want to be the cool, confident guy, even if it's just an ""act"". It doesn't matter. It doesn't even matter if you make it kind of obvious that it's an act (you don't want to be be pretending to be someone you're not) as long a you do that in a fun way. And you don't want to do that for the whole conversation but you can use it here and there.

Think about how you might banter with some good friends. You might make some more ridiculous comments just to make it more fun, you might make jokes you wouldn't in other company. But you can use some of that vibe to make a conversation more flirty as well.

Is your weight something you could/want to work on?
