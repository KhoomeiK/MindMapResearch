PrettyLittleLiars,fr0afjo,t3_glg5o7,1589788823.0,"The only PLL ending I would want to see my dude is one where Alison is revealed to have been the final A, and killed off or carted off to jail at least. If you cut the crap out of the final two episodes you'd only have like one or two scenes left."
PrettyLittleLiars,fr0acd9,t3_glg9r0,1589788740.0,"Because Toby and Ezra are considered hawt pieces of mancandy and Mona is not. Dudes can get away with murder on this show, but whenever a girl (especially one who's not considered as attractive) does anything, then lo and behold, suddenly there's consequences!"
PrettyLittleLiars,fr0a7sh,t1_fqx74uz,1589788620.0,"I think you commented on the wrong message. But also Toby worked against them too, he wasn't a double agent when he gave Cece Mona's RV. And Mona was a double agent from season 3ish on, so it's not fair that they get forgiven and she not."
PrettyLittleLiars,fr0a5a7,t1_fqxlcjp,1589788555.0,"We don't know that Toby's intent was to help the liars really. I mean there was that plot about his mom's death and he betrayed the liars for info on her death, so no, I wouldn't say his intent was to 'help' the liars at all, especially after he got caught. It's just that like you said, they were both involved in popular ships."
PrettyLittleLiars,fr09ytj,t1_fqxc32h,1589788386.0,"Some people took the Shay thing as Lindsey accusing that Shay is a homophobe when really all she said about it was basically that Shay was too self conscious in their kissing scenes, and not really fully committing to the kisses, and she was going all in and how that made her look really eager and it made Paige look needy and stuff. I mean, if any other cast member said that I feel like people would just laugh it off. A lot of the stuff she said people would probably just laugh off. I don't get why everyone is so obsessed with villainizing Lindsey and Paige if I'm being honest.

She said even less about Troian. All she said was she basically kept her at arms length and she figured that she didn't want to get really involved with her, and that Troian was pretty selective with her company, which again isn't an insult. I mean she was pretty diplomatic in this interview, even though she was so open, but people pick apart everything she said and twisted it around to make her sound like an asshole. Like the Trump thing. She was never a Trump supporter, she made some sarcastic tweet about him and everybody took that and ran with it and accused her of being a Trump supporter and shit and to this day people still think she actually supported chump because of that."
PrettyLittleLiars,fr09clh,t1_fqx64zz,1589787817.0,"I mean just because other people had a different relationship with Troian, doesn't invalidate Lindsey's experience. Maybe she held her at arm's length, you don't know that and it's pretty naive to assume everything was fine and dandy on set, and to 'lose respect' over someone admitting they weren't that close to somebody else.

&#x200B;

 And as for the 'bashing' I really wouldn't consider what she did as bashing. She complained a bit about Shay and Marlene, but she never bashed anybody, if anything she kept praising everybody and complimented them out the wazoo. She kept talking about how she has a lot of respect for them and how she was impressed by Troian's directing and stuff."
PrettyLittleLiars,fr08p6g,t1_fqxkr8r,1589787221.0,"Maybe. It might have been for the best but it also might have been for the worst. We don't know the root of her problems and if the extra exposure might have helped her or been another hurdle for her. For all we know it could've destroyed her, but it also could've gone the other way and helped her. It might have gotten her character more attention and love from the fans and cancelled out some of the hate, or it could've made the hate worse because she was on more. We don't really know."
PrettyLittleLiars,fr08gfq,t1_fqxzu5z,1589786994.0,"I figure they just cared about the numbers and the money and since they brought in views, they didn't care about the handling of stuff. Marlene could get away with that because she brought in money. But when PLL TP and Ravenswood tanked they probably weren't too happy. Though instead of seeing the error of their ways, it seems they just obsessed about winning views through pandering to fans instead, and just redoubled the fanservice after every fail. Throwing Caleb back into PLL and forcing Haleb back together, and claiming they would've gotten Emishit together in the end to appease the stans that boycotted their spin-offs out of spite lol."
PrettyLittleLiars,fr07yfp,t3_gljy43,1589786532.0,You're not the only one. Seven years of waiting for that? Ludicrous.
PrettyLittleLiars,fqxldwh,t1_fqxbwxc,1589734093.0,"Yeah I get you. It was like an undeserved pat in the back for doing everybody else's bare minimum. And I'm not comparing their skill, I'm just talking about the credit they got for it.

 A lot of the more minor roles were acted pretty magnificently but everybody was too busy patting the main actors in the back, y'know? Like they had some very moving bits too but they seem to be largely overlooked in favor of the regulars' stuff. Even if that stuff was just adequate, like you said about Shay's acting. I just think some of these other actors deserve more credit than they got."
PrettyLittleLiars,fqxkrak,t1_fqxcvcp,1589733821.0,"Yeah. And honestly bringing her back in s2 was a bit of a mistake. No one liked how they killed her off but also they sort of gave her fans false hope by bringing her back and that wasn't nice either. They should've left her off when she like served her purpose in s1, not brought her back as filler, so they could kill her in season 2."
PrettyLittleLiars,fqxkl9s,t1_fqxgzct,1589733746.0,Didn't he? At least he was offered the position I guess. More than I can say for Lindsey probably.

PrettyLittleLiars,fqxatnt,t1_fqx9m2m,1589729129.0,"True, Maya had more of an impact, but I always considered Maya as one of those early on characters who like had a small role to fill and was never meant to stick around, is what I meant. Like Sean was to establish Hanna's low self esteem despite her good looks. Maya was meant to help Emily come out of the closet and then kind of go. She never seemed like she was going to stick around and they never really expanded on her character. When they did it was mostly negative. Like she was pretty jealous of Emily just watching a video of Paige in that episode for example."
PrettyLittleLiars,fqx9xag,t1_fqx69vv,1589728710.0,"NGL there's truth to that but Troian is considered somehow leaps and bounds above everyone else for like starring off into the distance in that one scene and it always baffled me. Not that she's trash but there were other actors out there who were just as good, if not better but she got so much more exposure that she's all everyone talks about. It's like mechanical at this point. No one ever even considers anyone else. 

And if I'm being honest Sasha is overrated too. She was ok as bratty Alison but definitely not as 'epic' or iconic as Alison stans claim that she is. 

Like Tammin said something about standing around and Lindsey joked that that was half her role in PLL but was she wrong though? She had a co-worker who was too self conscious to really give it 100% and they barely gave any of their non faves much to really sink their teeth into and it was really disappointing honestly cause watching the same people over and over again, with their repetitive storylines was just so boring. They wasted so many opportunities (especially when Alison came back) to bring some of the supportive cast to the forefront. But instead we just kept getting more of the same. They had so many different members of the cast and I hate that they barely ever used them."
PrettyLittleLiars,fqx8ymp,t1_fqx7rld,1589728263.0,"Maya had a more undeveloped vibe but I didn't really see it as a good thing. I saw her more like a Sean for Emily, who like she had to ditch to sort of move on cause they stagnated as far back as s1. I'm on the Paige/Paily end of the spectrum but I agree mostly."
PrettyLittleLiars,fqx8rnc,t1_fqx4ixb,1589728170.0,"Yeah. I don't know what's going on in Lindsey's head. On one hand her openness makes me root for her but on the other it makes me worry about her career. And yeah Sasha's probably in a place where she can still find work right now and wouldn't jeopardise her connections by uttering a bad word about them, same as most other members of the cast. I'm surprised Janel was so open actually, but she didn't name any names and was very conservative about what she said too so I don't see her getting any negative repercussions from the whole thing. 

Lindsey seems to be really back to the bottom right now though workwise so she probably figured things couldn't get much worse for her if she was a little honest. And she still said the loveliest things about Shay and stuff and took on all the blame herself for everything, she just opened up about her feelings a lil bit. And even that little had people going off in the comments. But then again it's youtube comments so what did I expect?"
PrettyLittleLiars,fqx6gyi,t1_fqx3sxk,1589726865.0,"That's what I mean, it's a blessing because characters like Caleb and Toby and Ezra were so overused they got boring and became one-note characters  and I couldn't stand them. Whereas Paige was around so little in comparison that she actually remained interesting. Plus all her plotlines didn't revolve around romantic stuff, she had her swimming stuff, and being bullied by Alison, which was relatable cause half the characters were, but maybe not as bad as her, and she had some mental health issues which was interesting as well. The downside was these characters that were underutilized didn't really get to live out entire arcs and stuff on-screen, and we didn't get a lot of resolution or closure with them."
PrettyLittleLiars,fqx62p0,t3_glgihv,1589726621.0,"YES! I'm not saying Lindsey's infallible but a lot of what she said matches my perception of some of these actors and stuff and I just really lost a lot of respect for some of them.

PrettyLittleLiars,fqx4rqd,t1_fqu2apa,1589725784.0,"I would agree that there was definitely an amount of representation that wasn't previously really prevalent in teen shows apart from like special episodes (oh no, so and so is cutting) but I believe they really dropped the ball with mental health issues and seeking help and a lot of the liars and their friends and loved ones had loads of unaddressed issues. Like, remember in season 2 when their parents wanted them to go to a psychiatrist and they were all wtf? Why did it take them a whole season when they'd clearly been struggling for so long. Especially Spencer's parents, who have been fighting with her on and off all season one, and who know she had a drug addiction. 

The focus was good but it felt half assed. Paige was clearly in a very unstable frame of mind in season one, season 3 post Nate, season 5 when Alison returned, etc and yet the solution was Emily kissing her better?! Caleb got shot?! Toby went through several car crashes. Jenna was blinded and instead of sympathy all she got was snide remarks.

And worst of all was the treatment of bullying in this show. It was essentially glorified and Alison made the biggest most epicest coolest person alive when she was a massive jerk to everyone, and made completely lame when she wasn't so what's the message there? Being a bish is cool and being nice is lame?! Bullying is funny? You've still got Emison stans calling Paige 'pigskin' out of spite with how the show and its creators glorified bullying and rewarded it. Cause in the end the bully got the girl and their victims got screwed over again."
PrettyLittleLiars,fqx3xp1,t1_fqva8n6,1589725240.0,"I mean their reactions were the worst part in some cases. And completely unrealistic. Like ""what if Alison turned out to be faking her death"" led to Aria killing a girl?! How? What? Why? How do you get there from that?"

PrettyLittleLiars,fqx3kho,t1_fqwqbg6,1589724995.0,True. You could tell she was really passionate about the project and not just saying things to build up rapport with the fans like certain actors (Shay and Sasha talking up Emison towards the end when they'd consistently been very negative and critical of it before that)
PrettyLittleLiars,fqx38qs,t1_fqwv4xw,1589724774.0,"I don't think we'd get it. Lindsey's not exactly at the peak of her career and everybody's throwing shade at her, claiming she's talking shit for attention. I haven't seen the response to Janel's claims but it might be more positive, but I don't see Sasha or anyone else part of the 'elite' group really being candid about that stuff. Either the OG main cast like Ian are oblivious or too scared to talk about it openly. Lindsey has nothing to lose now so she can be more candid, but it's clearly costing her considering the blowback."

PrettyLittleLiars,fqx2wzw,t1_fqwguto,1589724553.0,"True, but at the same time, I hate how they picked and chose and overutilized some characters/actors and underutilized others. They were all pretty beloved, so it was clear they were playing favorites."

A lot of people seem to have taken sides against her and gone on the defensive but a lot of what she said really correlates with some other behind the scenes rumours we've heard and seems to match up Janel's story too.

PrettyLittleLiars,fqx2mx2,t1_fqwc1bq,1589724359.0,It really wasn't about friendship and that was so disappointing.

PrettyLittleLiars,fqwoaxe,t1_fqw11tc,1589711860.0,"I agree with your point. Especially towards the end. Like why keep adding redundant secondary characters like Sara Harvey and convoluting the plot? There were already loads of far more interesting characters we were invested in.

I get that they didn't have access to everybody all of the time, but I think they should have gone a little more like the books in a way, where they focus on one liar at a time because liars like Emily felt like an afterthought. Like ""oh I guess we have to include the lesbian, so throw some new girl in while Lindsey's away for the drama"".

I like that Mona had always managed to keep a certain mystery about her, which you're right, with the writing ruining everything, it's probably better she wasn't included as much, so she wasn't ruined like other characters were. But at the same time, it became a rare treat to see her and after a certain point it made no sense that Alison would be included so much and Mona not.

Especially considering Mona was much more versed in the ways of A. It made no sense for them to wait so long to call on her and ask her for help and for them to trust her considering how quickly they all decided to trust Alison again and other characters too, after they do them dirty. Like Ezra in season four for example. 

Dude spied on them for how long? Got forgiven before, like, episode 100 because fanservice dictated they must appease the most vocal twitter stans in their 100th episode anniversary. Meanwhile Paige was still running around town trying to protect Emily and disband Mona's group to keep Emily from getting caught in the crossfire and she didn't get so much as an 'oops', and a handshake by the time she got back. They even cut the scene where she tries to get Lucas to quit the group hoping she could sway them to disband and he reveals plans were already in motion.

It's a fine line between giving these characters more time and getting them more well-liked and completely ruining their characters with stupid plots machinated only to give them kudos and woobify them so people like them more. Like Toby's stupid mommy plot in s3."
PrettyLittleLiars,fqwno8x,t1_fqw42rj,1589711203.0,"Alison isn't any more than Mona is. end of story. The writers are full of sh*t and her inclusion was completely forced. By the end she was still being a jerk to the liars and Emily didn't even trust her. She even sold them all out again when Cece died, and she told Lorenzo she 'wasn't sure anymore' if they were involved in her death. 

Mona might not be on the same tier as someone like Emily but just because Alison was forced to mingle with the liars for one or two seasons doesn't make her anywhere near as equal as someone like Spencer. 

Heck, at least Mona was really around from season one, giving her more of a claim to being a 2nd tier liar than Alison ever had. Just because they were 'friends' at some point doesn't make her a liar any more than it makes Holden one, or Toby, or any other friend of the liars and Alison stans can die mad about it."

PrettyLittleLiars,fqw0990,t1_fqu6pw2,1589689357.0,"They're not really. The core four is Emily, Hanna, Aria and Spencer. There's no core 'five'. Alison was never a member of the group. She ruled the group with an iron fist but she was never on the same level as the girls so she was never a core member of the group. And just because they forced her into some scenes doesn't make up for the fact that she double crossed them and sold them out every chance she got, lol. Mona and Alison are on a tier of their own but no, they're not really core liars. Mona is just about as much of a liar as Alison is, which is not at all."
PrettyLittleLiars,fqvzuja,t1_fqvu5u0,1589689066.0,"I have to disagree. They didn't do a great job balancing the 4 girls storylines. There was too much Ezria and too little Emily storylines. Side characters were dropped so casually and romantic scenes were forced out the wazoo to pander to the shippers. Certain liars got way more scenes and attention and honestly the characterization went out the window because they wanted to shiptease Emishit by bringing Sasha back on as a sort of regular. All in all they did a piss-poor job of balancing.

&#x200B;

 Like, at some point they had Caleb and Ezra as regulars but not Toby or Paige despite Toby being introduced before Caleb, and Paige being around about as long as him, and then Toby was made regular and Paige was basically shipped off for a season, and yet Caleb was still a regular even after he came back from missing for a season but Paige never was. It made no damn sense."
PrettyLittleLiars,fqvzjfh,t1_fqvqaom,1589688845.0,I think a lot of the cast was. Like Melissa and Paige and Lucas. Their actors knocked it out of the park pretty often but they never seem to get as much credit as someone like Troian.

I mean the kids aside, and the occasional visit to throw some flowers on Cece's grave, I just don't see her settling, especially in Rosewood where so much stuff happened. In fact I don't think Emily would stay there either. And after the divorce, not only do I not see them getting back together, but if anything, Emily has a strong case for sole custody, which is what I think she went for, and I don't think that Alison would get to really see them much. Probably a bit on holidays and stuff. I doubt she'd move to town for that."
PrettyLittleLiars,fqtp6ct,t1_fqt8u4d,1589643370.0,"I agree with you so much right now. I didn't watch TP but from what I gather PLL was just a stepping stone for Shay and she has no intention of ever returning to it for real. She may say she might to appease fans and tease a reunion but no, I don't think she really would.

Without Shay there's no Emily. They can't recast at this point and they can't have Emishit without her so there's no way that it'd be a thing in TP. And I'm sure Marlene was looking for a new meal ticket and that she wanted to stretch TP as far as she could and in order to do that she'd need to keep it interesting with romantic plots for the OG PLL cast and unless it was Mona, then Alison was most likely to end up with that Taylor girl.

I don't know much about this character, but from what I gather though her storyline parallels Alison's a lot and in a way that kind of seems like selfcest but in another way if anyone was to date themselves, it'd be Alison so I can kind of see that happening."
PrettyLittleLiars,fqtocn2,t1_fqspjbm,1589642904.0,"Core four yes, but if you wanna include Mona and Alison, I wouldn't call it a core group anymore. Like, if you're going as far as including Alison, then include Mona too. But neither of them is part of the core group though."

It seems unfair that they include all the other bedbuddies, and Alison and Mona but never Paige/Lindsey. Except Toby/Keegan, but the general consensus is that the dude was in the middle of nowhere and unable to attend, not that he wasn't even invited."

PrettyLittleLiars,fqstgk6,t1_fqsrrso,1589618249.0,"Ya'll Emison stans love to skew the truth. Like calling the head dunk a 'drowning' attempt.

Paige isn't obsessed with anything. She's just seeing Emily struggle to keep her head above water and trying to help her any way she knows how, and she sees Alison taking advantage of her good nature and she wants to put a stop to that and help Emily out. 

You say she goes too far but Alison has been a leech, sucking Emily's blood for years and I get why she's so frustrated that Emily still puts up with that and puts her needs ahead of her own and doesn't take care of herself. In fact, before they tried to force the Emishit thing, every character close to Emily had called her out (Spencer, Hanna, Pam, etc) over this. 

Paige never tried to murder anybody. She tried to defend herself when she thought Emily was starting up some campaign to steal her spot from the team. And Alison didn't get threatened for years. She might have been threatened a bit in the start, but she ran away and left everyone else to deal with her mess rather than fight her own battles, and she continued to let the liars fight in her stead for the duration of the show.

And you can't blame Paige for any of that considering it was Alison's actions in the past AND in the future (being catty and manipulative, and trying to call her out in front of a teacher and shit) that started things off. You can't blame Paige for thinking Alison hadn't changed when Alison still behaved the same bitchy way towards her. She can't see something that isn't there. 

Emily being 'friends' with Alison IS wild. She has been using and abusing Emily and her friends, using them as pawns in her sick games, and pitting them against their loved ones and each other for years. Season five you have Alison turning the girls against Hanna when she needed them the most.

 Season six or seven Alison misses Aria's thing because she was mad at Hanna and she's even guilting the liars over it. She always puts herself first and uses them to whatever end she wishes. She tried to force them to plead for Cece to be released because she wanted her out despite them being tormented and traumatised by her. She married Rollins but god forbid she allow Emily to date Paige because she hates Paige. 

Nevermind she never cared about who Emily saw before. Nevermind she literally married a dude. But the second she sees her grip on Emily slipping she's gotta play the victim card so she doesn't lose her tenuous grasp on the liars.

So far all the bad things you've mentioned Paige has done not only pale in comparison to what Alison has done over the years but it's also skewed to make her sound unhealthy. Paige lied, yes, but it was because she wanted to reach Emily when Alison was keeping her locked up in her witch's tower, so she could give her a job application because she was trying to help her be independent.

She didn't spy on her and Emily. She walked up to the brew, which is a SHOP, and looked in the window to see if it was still open, when she noticed that the door was closed but the light still on. She refused to listen to Emily when she was frustrated, sure, but it was better and healthier than starting a fight just because she was aggravated. Instead she took her time to cool off and think things over.

She didn't take a few interactions as proof that she and Emily were a thing, but it was rather the way Emily was behaving and still buying into Alison's bullshit and making excuses for her that made her rethink starting something with her. 

And yes, Alison IS the manipulative one because she was the one crying ""Oh, Why is Emily hanging out with Paige when she has a girlfriend!!!"" while trying to kiss her to make her stay and leave Paige behind when she realized that Emily wanted to get back together with Paige. 

 She's the one who kept trying to use Emily's old crush on her as a way of winning the liars over when she came back and started losing her grip on them. She's the one who always lies and manipulates the liars and controls them to get what she wants. Not Paige. That's what's tiring and the liars are the ones that need to move on from Alison because this is unhealthy for everyone involved."
PrettyLittleLiars,fqsrz57,t1_fqsrmkr,1589616773.0,"Lol when did I say it was acceptable? I didn't. You're putting words in my mouth. All I said was that she seemed happier with these dudes than she ever did with Emily, pointing out how forced Emison was. Just because she wasn't 'as bad' to Emily doesn't erase that she was horrible to her and it doesn't make it right for them to be together."
PrettyLittleLiars,fqsrs0z,t1_fqsq583,1589616575.0,"There's a day dedicated to that crud? Ugh.

What did Troian say about Paige and filming with the guys?

I want a main character to be killed off too. Specifically Alison. I figure he's probably talking about Ezra though. I'm with him on that front too, lol. I'd hate a movie or reunion or whatever. I'm sure Marlene would try to use it to segway into more pll projects by throwing in as much fanservice as possible and forcing Emishit back together and crud.

Thanks for the summary. My takeaway is that it was just more of the same and generic stuff and nothing really of interest, like about the rumours about the cast not getting along, and any of the recent things Lindsey Shaw has revealed about feeling like they lowkey hated her and stuff. Even then though they'd probably just lie to cover their asses so what's the point?"
PrettyLittleLiars,fqsrbff,t1_fqspryb,1589616115.0,"It doesn't seem fair in my opinion. Paige was a huge part of the show, and just because she wasn't with Emily in the end it feels like erasure that one of the only main romantic interests that wasn't there was the lesbian. Alison would've been there as one of the semi-liars anyway, so it really feels unfair that Lindsey was probably not even invited. It's like they're trying to wash their hands of Paige and Lindsey and it sucks."

If they do their work and set up a real romance with her and someone fresh, who she didn't torture for example, that might be ideal, but I'd be happy as long as they leave Emily alone, or at if they had the decency to give her the happy ending that she deserved with Paige."

I mean they've all got their own things but they somehow managed to make it, so why wasn't Lindsey there?

Edit: why are you booing me? It's an honest question!"
PrettyLittleLiars,fqsofkd,t1_fqpf1oi,1589613325.0,"Me too. Like, Lindsey Shaw was really great and very talented and stuff, but right now she's just Moze or that girl everyone hated on PLL because they shipped something other than her couple and that doesn't seem fair on her. A lot of these actors deserve better than what they got on PLL. I doubt they'll all get it but at least some of them are still finding consistent work. I think it's easier for the male actors because they don't really have to take time off if and when they have kids. Tammin for example missed a fair bit of PLL and stuff when she was pregnant with her girls and it's not easy to get back into things once you've lost your momentum. I heard Lindsey even got dropped by her agent or something."

PrettyLittleLiars,fqpcpqc,t1_fqpacv5,1589542749.0,"I tried so hard to understand Emily but she was so inconsistent. She'd let Alison for example get away with straight up abusing her and her friends, but the time Paige was defensive cause she basically outed her against her wishes to someone, she gets 'fed up' and dumps her? That was so idiotic! It seems like she had some ulterior motives sometimes and either loved/hated Paige depending on her mood. She'd go from treating her like a precious, fragile little thing to treating her like something she'd stepped in, as if she had some sort of multiple personality disorder and it was confusing as fudge. Like she's in love with Paige so why is she riding Paige for insignificant shit everyone else can get away with, but letting other people who don't mean a hair on a donkey's arse to her, get away with murder? 


Why is Paige specifically held to such a higher standard where she gets in shit for as much as lying by omission when that's literally all she freaking does to Paige, 24/7? Why does she act all superior when she's done so much worse? Remember when she got jealous because 'I SAW THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT HER!' (Shana) and Paige had to assure her that she meant nothing to her, and it was a fling she had when she was gone, MEANWHILE EMILY KEEPS GOING ON ABOUT HOW SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH ALISON AND MAYA AND STUFF AND PAIGE DOESN'T MAKE A PEEP!
