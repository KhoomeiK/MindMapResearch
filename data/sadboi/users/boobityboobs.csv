Anxiety,fq9od49,t3_ghiqy2,1589203536.0,"Every time these days, have to replay and assess each moment. Normal break in conversation or uncomfortable silence. Did I inadvertently insult them?"

AskRedditAfterDark,fptlkhi,t3_gf0y2f,1588893533.0,"Not a guy, but I did pay for one onlyfans (though it was one month on sale as I'm a cheap bitch). I think part of it was the anticipation then the grand reveal of nudes. I  stumbled upon her twitter and enjoyed her comedy/light-hearted video content for a while which made seeing what was underneath all the more appealing, she wasn't just whipping them out. Once you get in and see them theyre like exclusive boobs."
AskRedditAfterDark,fof9p03,t3_g6w2ov,1587730520.0,"I used to do it until some arsehole twigged who I was and sent it to my family/work (who were all supremely cool about it and have my eternal gratitude). Since then I've only shared with a very, very select few people online (though have slipped a couple of nudes out there).

However, my main goal when I was posting was pleasure. It turned me on to think that people round the world might be wanking looking at me, it was a genuine thrill. But as with all thrills there's a risk and I got hit by it."
AskRedditAfterDark,fof9bur,t3_g72nlw,1587730217.0,"I switch all the time, but I'm (F) probably 90% gay at this point so pretty much pinned down with a puss in on my face, both hands buried in another 2 while they go to town on my tits, and a big, thick black dick buried inside me."
BlackMetal,fnu20sb,t1_fntxxys,1587253009.0,"Flight delayed led to missed train led to no gig. Sad times. Still caught some of the acoustic ""gig"" on Twitch tonight (fortriuproductions) which was pretty cool. Roll on December (I fucking hope)."
BlackMetal,fntkw6c,t3_g3p5e8,1587243706.0,I'm meant to be seeing these guys at the tail end of the year. Don't fuck this for me 'rona! Missed the chance to travel up to Scotland a couple months back to see them in Glasgow as well.
Anxiety,fmpdi2q,t3_fwm9rl,1586278893.0,"What else do people do before going to sleep if not lying awake remembering any number of embarrassing situations, or remembering situations which could have turned embarrassing (a weird new one for me). Who are these people who just close their eyes and sleep."

PowerMetal,fmm58l5,t3_fw0n2j,1586199024.0,Loved hearing Tobias on this when it came out. Hopefully Arjen gets something on an Avantasia album sometime.
Alestorm,fm9dou9,t1_fm7tkhb,1585866628.0,"Yeah, just feels like a last minute bonus track, though  chorus is pretty catchy. Not my cup of tea (/insert rum joke here). Still excited for the album though!"
Anxiety,flqehm3,t3_fq8z5a,1585391331.0,Constantly! You should see my email inbox. I feel like a terrible person for it and the more it builds up the guiltier I feel but I can't bring myself to even open the bloody things.
BlackMetal,flp5mhq,t1_flopqpw,1585352149.0,"Yeah, I think the years of anticipation build our expectations a little high. I'm liking more with every playthrough though.

Holy shit, put on Rise of the Black Star to check them out and I'm loving it. Don't know how this got by me but than you!"
Anxiety,flo4qin,t3_fpqcs6,1585331581.0,"I brought a white board home from work for my ""office"" wet up. I found writing the day of the week at the start of my working day helped ground me a little so I could concentrate."

socialmedia,fkrlt9r,t3_fjdahi,1584471373.0,"Depends what you do. I had avoided SM for years but downloaded a couple of apps last year due to my job. I've recently deleted my personal profile again and just access it to do work posts due to similar reasons. Just fucked my head seeing the constant negativity on my feed, so now I log on > post on work page > engage and clear out.

So yeah - if you don't need it professionally and if you  can keep in touch with friends/family externally, don't bother using it if it's messing with your head. And if you do rejoin, never read the comments on news articles!"
Anxiety,fkrdhmd,t1_fkq7hc3,1584466688.0,"Not at all. Nor this comment. Spent my day emailing people and on the phone quite happily. Then for no reason a switch will flip and that's it, I'll over analyse every innocuous comment for days."

Other times I worry about upvoting a post that made me laugh

Worst thing is, I post on some NSFW things and don't bat an eyelid, but deleted the same comment lilke 10 times on a music recommendation thread. Sigh."
PowerMetal,fko8c02,t1_fkgwrqc,1584382085.0,"Art of War was the one that really pushed them to the next level, so that first. Load of people love Carolus Rex but I've never been 100% sold on it (though I'm definitely in the minority so try that.). 

I'd say go Primo Victoria if you like their rawer, faster tracks, and maybe Heroes if you like the bouncier side of things."
