I was on a band field trip with a bunch of people. The buses had the lights off and the chaperones go to sleep on the bus. We were about to go to the fiels to start marching when this girl who is really cute and hot and has guys falling all over for her talks to me. We've talked before but never like this. We stand in line and then she asks me out of the blue if I want to touch her boobs. I laughed and she stared at me first and then forced a laugh. I stopped laughing at then said ""In the bus."" She gave me a fun look and I laughed. I never talked to her on the bus but when I was on it, I realized I was being a dumbass at the time. (Btw, the busses get really freaky as we go back at night and the lights are off and also people are really horny (I've only heard stories but haven't experienced it cause yeah. I mean, I'm on Reddit so you guys get it))"

xboxone,fn4aueg,t3_fz0buk,1586637585.0,"There's already 27k comments. Chances are slim of winning. Yet most likely, it won't be random. Most likely, you will choose the best 5 comments. I'll join just cause why not. 

Also, the average game price is $49.99 - $59.99. What this will cost you (as an average)is $249.95 -- $299.95. 

But wait, the most expensive game is actually not a game. It's  22,500 robux for xbox. This costs $199.99. If all 5 people get this (unlikely), it will cost you about $999.95. 

Now, for this to be economically beneficial to you, the amount of awards in money given to you must surpass at least the least average ($249.95). 

You (at this time) have 18 awards. I did the math and they gave you $23.96 dollars in awards. You get three months (2 platinum and 4 gold) of Reddit Premium which amounts to $17.97. 

You also get 700 extra coins thanks to gold and other awards. The awards give 300 coins to the community. That adds up to 1000 coins. The closest package is 1100 coins (3.99). 

Adding that to your $17.97 of Reddit Premium, you get $23.95 (a little more but close enough). You are getting $21.95 to yourself (also a bit more but still) worth in Reddit Coins and donating 300 coins to the community.

$249.95 - $23.95 is $226. That's how much you have to least averagely pay for the games. 

You truly are a noble hero. Thank you."
