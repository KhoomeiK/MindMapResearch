witchcraft,fr3yi7g,t3_gmgbtg,1589869955.0,"I am personally someone who is trying to explore witchcraft and have noticed people discussing this! With every community however, there will always be the ""gatekeepers"" or those simply placing themselves above others. I don't know if that's specifically what's going on here (I have only begun my journey really this year), but it's what has put me off for most of my life. The negativity or lack of empathy to those who are new can be frightening to those just starting to join this community (and from what I've seen many of the people are actually really kind and want others to learn!). If I were younger it might be more daunting, but seeing people who are kind enough to mentor/answer questions or show their concern respectfully have made my journey much more comfortable than maybe a year or two ago. I'm so happy you brought this up because I really don't see many people acknowledging this aspect!"

depression,fkmfs29,t3_fj8mva,1584327950.0,"I get this a lot lol. They'll go to parties of their other friends or just hang out between themselves and I'll just see how they move along fine without me. Or they won't text me or hang until I do something first. It makes me feel optional which is kind of sad, but also comforting to know that if I do go they'll kind of just function fine. Especially since I do doubt myself and think I'm annyoing, it's good to see I'm not the glue holding them together I guess lol"
depression,fklz09j,t1_fklyw99,1584317664.0,"I used to work out, but I do guess this gives me ample time to get back into a routine! I completely forgot about that lol, thanks!"
depression,fklwn9y,t1_fklwhvm,1584316207.0,Thanks! Any categories you would suggest? Ive watched most of the psychological ones lol
depression,fkf7xg6,t1_fkez3lg,1584128823.0,"The bathroom breaks and walks are the best way to go for me. Dont be afraid when you feel it building up to just step out for a few minutes and find your bearings, try and keep your head clear and if breathing exercises work for you, do those then."
depression,fkf5t9v,t3_fi4v61,1584127644.0,Me too! I hope I can keep this up for as long as i can lol
depression,fkf5pol,t3_fi2suk,1584127586.0,"I have no words except that Im sorry. You and your late wife sound like wonderful people and i really hope that even if things aren't good now, theyll get better. Even if its the tiniest amount, like you found some money laying around. Anything. I hope everything gets better for you and you find peace in the storm of your life. Im proud of your story and hope I see you post because thatll at least mean you lived another day. Im proud of you for sharing your story because it's an important one to hear."

depression,fkevs2c,t3_fi1mik,1584121707.0,"School just closed for me, but for the most part is was the perfect distraction. Im hoping to just spend more time walking my dog or maybe try talking to people I havent in a while idk. Keep your head up and  take the advice of others on this subreddit, hopefully this will pass soon."
raisedbynarcissists,fkeveut,t3_fi2lem,1584121489.0,"I thought I was the only way! For a while it actually made me think she wasnt an nmom, but then I realised I was just co-dependent. My twin is the sams as your brother, but for some reason every trivial thing I think of I tell her. It always leads to her complaining about herself, but I keep doing it. Finally I can relate!"
SuicideWatch,fke98d5,t3_fhzr9a,1584108218.0,"I dont even know what to say because everything youve just said is truly a terrible and traumatic event. I know therapy is something anyone can recommend, but it can truly help if you find the right one. Try and find some healthy coping methods youve used in the past and stay strong. Both you and your friend are in a very tough place right now and I hope you can both make it out. You both need someone and each other. I hope you can pull through because you are an amazing person who saved their friend. Even if it doesnt feel like the right decision now, it might be the best decision later in life. Maybe not tomorrow, and maybe not even in three years; but it's a decision you made that has value and will hopefully help. I think you are amazing and definitely more helpful than anyone I know when I have done something like this in the past. Keep going. Keep your head up. I don't believe in god, but Im praying for you anyways. Tomorrow might not be better, but it'll be another day."
SuicideWatch,fke8ge7,t3_fhwig2,1584107727.0,"Same here. Hospital bills, friends leaving, diagnosed but not treated, parents fighting, etc. In freshman year I attempted and now its junior year and things just got worse. Probably will commit again, but damn would it have been better if it had worked the first time"
raisedbynarcissists,fkaijny,t1_fka9e7c,1584009506.0,I hope I do! Ive got a decade of baggage so wasting time is not on my agenda lol
raisedbynarcissists,fk9k9gv,t3_fh0cvy,1583977712.0,"My nmom said that i couldnt have depression because ""im too young"" and that i was faking, etc. Its a very common aspect of a narcissist who always wants to be the only victim. Sadly the truth of my life is holding on long enough to get a therapist! lol"
SuicideWatch,fk9glhw,t3_fh0abe,1583975656.0,Few years ago (I was 14) I attempted to end my life and was taken to the hospital (the mental ward or whatever when you are suicidal) and I was there for barely 10 hours and the bill? THOUSANDS! It didnt help I was then told it was my fault and it's still held against me. America is a literal joke with its health services
