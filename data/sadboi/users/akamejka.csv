AskReddit,fgg5sca,t1_fgg3nf1,1580754855.0,"I've been in the relationship for over 5 years now and it's going fine...  also even though a lot of my happiness depends on it, I don't NEED the relationship, I just recognize that I am happier in it and would go back to unhappiness without it. 

That doesn't mean I won't end the relationship if my partner cheats on me for example or if we aren't good for each other anymore."
AskReddit,fgg1vfd,t1_fgg0agh,1580752431.0,"Yes it's alright to feel unfulfilled when you are alone and feel that you need someone by your side to feel more happy and complete.

I was never a happy person before I got into a relationship and I would say since I got into one I'm much happier. If I followed your advice I wouldn't have gotten into a relationship and wouldn't be as fulfilled as I currently am."

antinatalism,fdkvgna,t1_fdktnu5,1578511989.0,"Well my potential children aren't ""waiting"" for me to give them life so there is no one that's being deprived of anything. 

Even if they had a better experience with life than me I don't see that as a gamble worth taking, even the smallest chance of them ending in the same place as me is heartbreaking. If they asked me why I gave life to them knowing that it's this way I would have no answer to give them.

I don't think a majority of people are happy to be born, I think most don't give any thought about it or are neutral about it. Whenever I get to know someone well they are always dissatisfied about something in their lives or wanting something more, it's difficult to find someone who is content with where they are in life."
antinatalism,fdkt69f,t1_fdkowym,1578510630.0,"Well you see, if you are from a third world you at least have hope that things can get better or think your kids will get a better life. However if you are well off and still think life is not worth living its a lot harder to have hope since you can't fathom how things could get better. Plenty of rich and ""successful"" people kill themselves, their suffering was just as real as anyone elses.

So since I'm well off and still not satisfied with life it's hard to see why I should have kids as they would probably end up in a similar situation as me if not worse off."

Of course you should try to do everything you can though, I think most people will find something that makes them feel better."
