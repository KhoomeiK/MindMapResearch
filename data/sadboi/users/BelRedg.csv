depression,fj11jy1,t1_fiy94by,1582911394.0,"Like all problems could be fixed with meditation and watching videos, right?, maybe they fake and pretend to be okay or that it's not a big deal, for some reason being depressed it's a weakness for some people.

Honestly I don't really have an advice for this man, I'm trying myself but I can listen, irl I would say the same.

I wouldn't ask you to pay stuff for me hahah, but I understand, you never know in the internet. I hope things get better for you."

depression,fisqrdz,t3_f9hcax,1582690813.0,"I feel exactly the way you do, something that I learned it‚Äôs that living with depression makes you feel like you don‚Äôt deserve your achievements or end up feeling guilty about doing too little or too much.

I often feel like I‚Äôm worthless and I don‚Äôt deserve anything I accomplish or that I don‚Äôt deserve happiness (I have fucked up a few times and beat myself a lot about it).

I hope someday I can get over this feeling but till then just gonna stick to therapy.

Life doesn‚Äôt have a meaning, so you have to give it one.
Honestly I‚Äôm still trying.

You are not alone on this, idk if it helps knowing that there‚Äôs more people who feels that way, but maybe you can find a little comfort on that.

You can talk to me if you need to (or want to).
Take care"
depression,fffy7gk,t1_fcs9o34,1579894393.0,"Sorry for the late response, I think since I'm pretty functional trying to not let everything fall apart outside I end up falling apart inside.

I sometimes just feel tired that even if everything get better some thoughts come back, I have been starting to think that even if I address the problems with some members of my family, get my relationship in a good track (we love each other like crazy, but just as me, she has depression and it's pretty hard sometimes), some thoughts will always come back and I just gotta learn how to deal with them."

At first I was like no, but then I felt too tired to create an excuse so I agreed anyway, I took the subway and just then my family called, they told me about them, how my niece it's doing, how my mom now it's taking English lessons and my sister it's doing great in her job.  I just listened and thought ""I can't do that to them"".

Most of the time I don't think I'll commit suicide soon, but there are some days where I consider doing it, but my parents already lost a child (even if it was in labor). 
I will stay here for as long as they do."
