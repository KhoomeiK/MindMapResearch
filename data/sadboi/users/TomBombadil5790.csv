They aren’t usually taken as a daily anxiety med, more of an as needed sort of thing.

You’re at least equally as “though-polic-y” as me by resorting to insults and potentially discouraging me from voicing my opinion in the future. But, to clarify, it’s not “thought police” to voice your disagreement with something. It’s literally the exact opposite."
OCD,fc654ht,t1_fc652px,1577472488.0,By turning it into a punchline? Do I need to explain?
OCD,fc64z61,t1_fc63lc5,1577472391.0,Yeah... that’s what I’m doing. Rather than advocating for a dignified way to reduce mental illness stigma that doesn’t play into pop culture stereotypes. Lmfao
OCD,fc5zzgc,t1_fc5nyic,1577469297.0,"I’m kind of with you. These posts trivialize how miserable it is to live with OCD. This sub, in particular, is full of randoms without OCD trying to benefit, socially, from the idea of having OCD. And that would only happen if it were romanticized in some way. 

Like, OCD is something that makes you “interesting” or adds dimension to your personality — and not something that can make your life a living hell. Really pisses me off."
OCD,fc1b4mq,t1_fc0xvme,1577313490.0,"I do this! I’ll go off to an upstairs bedroom and “nap” because I’m “tired”. My family has more or less accepted my frequent naps. To be fair, being around people is exhausting sometimes. So, naps are necessary."
OCD,fc17jbp,t1_fc0e74j,1577310495.0,"Type 2! What about you? And, yeah, I always feel like I’m just “putting on a show” or that it’s all in my head. Seems to be a common theme. Probably because we’re socialized to just “get over” mental illness."
OCD,fby4iy8,t1_fbx3a2c,1577207909.0,I have bipolar and OCD so I’m active on both subs. But I think I posted on the OCD sub about doubting yourself or something like that. You’re very kind. 😊
OCD,fbx0sib,t1_fbx02js,1577165075.0,"Yeah, I’m just salty. 😭"
OCD,fbwvn6w,t3_eeugae,1577160647.0,"Honestly, this sub has a lot of ignorance. Shitposts, memes, and generic questions get way more attention than people who post genuine, sometimes troubling, concerns. 

Not to mention, there are a fuckload of people posting/commenting about living with OCD and it’s symptoms who have never been formally diagnosed. It trivializes how miserable OCD is on a daily basis. 

Not criticizing your post. Just the culture of this sub and certain people in it."
OCD,fbtkf6x,t3_eefoks,1577082266.0,"It just reinforces the compulsion. Kind of sucks. 

I do this thing where I have to check if I have my  debit card still, like a zillion times, while going to the store. Every time I actually do lose it I know that it’s just making the compulsion stronger in the future."

OCD,fbfw6w8,t1_fbfi22d,1576823220.0,"Yes! Same. It took me a really long time to not take editorial comments about my work personally. I would go home and think “wow, they must think I’m a piece of shit for not defining x”. And stuff like that. I have gotten a lot better about it, though. I hope that it gets easier for you! One thing that helped me was to, over time, reframe my thinking about editorial comments. Away from seeing them as criticism and toward seeing them as ways to make my paper even better than it already is. Nobody’s perfect after all. Even if we feel the pressure to be. 

Thank you!

I didn’t even notice! But that’s awesome! Lmao, my therapist explained that, sometimes, people with severe social anxieties will get fixated on fantasy worlds to help them dissociate from what’s bothering them. That definitely holds true for me and my obsession with Tolkien. 😂"
OCD,fbf8oeu,t1_fbf7gj5,1576804463.0,"Yes! Haha. And, weirdly, I think grad school sort of encourages some obsessions. Like, my fixation on details and “just rightness” is an asset and applauded in grad school so it can go under the radar sometimes. 

But, thank you. I have hope that I can one day be more relaxed too! 😊"
OCD,fbf3lm5,t1_fbbsbmp,1576800671.0,"Thanks for the reply! 

I agree. I just had therapy again today and feel a lot better now. Like you, I’m realizing that so many of my behaviors are structured around the OCD and I had no idea. It’s kind of scary, for me at least, to realize that so much of how I behave is actually disordered (social anxiety, counting, rituals, etc.). I kind of had a mini existential crisis after taking the Y-BOCS."
OCD,fbf3dc3,t1_fbejg54,1576800500.0,"Yeah, that’s the one. Thanks. 

I’m also in grad school and, as mentioned, was just recently diagnosed. While taking the Y-BOCS I began to realize how much of my behavior stemmed from a need to silence the obsessive thoughts, specifically my need to micromanage every aspect of my life. I wonder if you had similar experiences, eye opening moments, where you were like, “oh, shit. I do that”. 

So many behaviors/intrusive thoughts I had normalized that are NOT normal, and I was doing them subconsciously not even realizing that I could eventually live without them."
