China and to a slightly lesser extent Russia are still communist in ideals but have adopted free market economies. You could argue they're not communist any more because of that but you still need to be a member to thrive or hold office. The only truly communist country left in the world would be North Korea. They still do collective farming, have gulags, and emulate the Stalinist form of communism like in the former Soviet Union.

Allergies,fqavsgn,t1_fpwp8en,1589226145.0,Many antihistamines have anticholinergic properties. Basically it disrupts your nervous system in a way that slows motor and cognitive function. Newer 2nd gen antihistamines aren't supposed to have as big as an effect but I still notice a difference. I think allegra is the only one that truly has no anticholinergic properties which is why it's considered a 3rd generation antihistamine by some.

Allergies,fqar0si,t3_gfyli0,1589223787.0,"""The SSRIs are the first rationally designed class of psychotropic medications. The strategy behind rational drug design is to develop a new drug that is capable of affecting a specific biological target, or in this case a special neural site of action (uptake pumps, receptors), while trying to avoid effects on other site of actions. The goal in such development is to produce pharmacological agents that are more efficacious, safer and better tolerated than older medications.[8] An initial success was achieved when medicinal chemists set out in search of the ideal SSRI with the chemical synthesis of zimelidine (figure 1) from the antihistamine drug brompheniramine,[7] which exhibited selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake with minimal inhibition of norepinephrine (NE) re-uptake. Most importantly, zimelidine did not come with the adverse effect profile as the TCAs and therefore it became the template for the second generation SSRIs.[5] Zimelidine was the first SSRI to be marketed, but several cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome were associated with the use of the drug which led to withdrawal from the market in 1983. Subsequently, several non-tricyclic SSRIs were discovered and marketed. Fluoxetine, which was FDA approved in 1987 and is usually thought to be the first SSRI to be marketed, paved the way for the next generation of SSRIs and was thought to be some kind of prototype.[5] Introduction of fluoxetine to the market is hailed as a miracle drug for the treatment of depression because it had fewer adverse effects, simpler dosing strategies and greater margin of safety when overdoses were consumed and thus it had better adherence, compared to the older antidepressants (TCAs and MAOIs).[5][9] Since then the number of drugs in the SSRI class has become bigger and they are now six (fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluvoxamine)""


Essentially the first modern SSRI's were derived from a 1st generation antihistamine. Many antihistamines react strongly with serotonin receptors in the brain. Older antidepressants like mirtazapine work as both a antihistamine and antidepressant. The atypical antipsychotic seroquel works as a antihistamine in lower doses. So in conclusion there are very strong links between antihistamines, antidepressants, and in some cases even atypical antipsychotics.

Most 1st generation antihistamines are anticholinergic which mean they slow down motor function and impact cognitive ability. Some 2nd generation meds do this is well but to a lesser extent. You see the same thing in some antidepressants and antipsychotics.   


I'm like OP where I'd rather suffer a bit to avoid effects on my mood and cognitive abilities but my allergies have gotten so bad these last few years it's pretty much wrecked my quality of life. So begrudgingly I've started taking allergy medicine again to alleviate some of the suffering. I still suffer it just takes the edge off a bit. Sorry for the wall of text but I think about this all time and the link between allergies and mood disorders."
