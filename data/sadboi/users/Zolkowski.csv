schizophrenia,fp8sd2r,t1_fp8s625,1588401397.0,I've been resistant to a lot of antipsychotics or they just didn't last so my psychiatrist is trying combinations. Haldol I just started. Been on clozapine for almost a year.
schizophrenia,fp8qe37,t1_fp8pgej,1588399610.0,I was never  aware of  ISPS  or Clubhouse-International. Thanks for the resources.
schizophrenia,fp8mx6r,t1_fp8mqqr,1588396667.0,I am also taking clozapine and yeah the blood draws suck
schizophrenia,fp8mn71,t1_fp8m100,1588396437.0,"Are there other medications I should consider? My psychiatrist isn't 
exactly taking requests."
schizophrenia,fp8injp,t1_fp8i1kw,1588393290.0,"Risperidone didn't do much for me, but it's different for everyone."
schizophrenia,fp8im7a,t1_fp8hx9r,1588393263.0,Do you just call them or what? Thanks for the advice
schizophrenia,fp8g4xy,t1_fp8eva2,1588391434.0,Does CBT do anything? Because that's what I am doing right now.
schizophrenia,fp8f45y,t1_fp8ey45,1588390710.0,Clozapine and Haldol. I haven't heard of thorazine. Sounds pretty radical though
schizophrenia,fokub7j,t1_fojhqfv,1587849088.0,Has that happened to you before?
schizophrenia,foihr0e,t1_foifclb,1587786950.0,I think you'd be in deep shit if you drive after doctor orders not to.
schizophrenia,foi7cv6,t1_foi6jet,1587780241.0,Yeah I wonder what kind of questioning they do. If it's about any recent psychotic episodes I'd be fucked. Much like having a seizure where you can't drive for so long after it.
schizophrenia,foi5zsp,t1_foi56pn,1587779423.0,Thanks for the info. It looks like a lot of people could put your driving abilities to question though.

Edit: Got it. Didn't know it was lyrics. Be well anyways."
schizophrenia,exffzzo,t3_cs54zg,1566239707.0,"What you are doing is awesome. It does, however, make me extremely uncomfortable. Drawing attention to myself is the reason why. 
Good luck with your efforts though. I don't mean to sound like I'm against the movement."
schizophrenia,ex8bxls,t1_ex777l1,1566071423.0,They don't mention that
schizophrenia,ex7zi8n,t1_ex7xvn4,1566066792.0,Yeah it's nothing but word salad for me when I try to make sense to others. It's especially difficult to convey what hallucinations I'm having
schizophrenia,ex4zps5,t1_ex4yvkl,1566013967.0,"Thanks, though it's not so much the space than it is making it understandable and not just random words that only make sense to me"
schizophrenia,ex0tpsd,t3_cqvkn8,1565921988.0,"I wish you the best. It's not going to be easy, but I believe in you"

I hear you."
schizophrenia,euykw6a,t1_euykoo5,1564104329.0,It's almost always worse when you need to describe your world salad to someone as it's happening.
schizophrenia,euyi688,t1_euyhw6l,1564102893.0,"I hear you. It even happens when I am trying to type something out as well.
I'll check my posts from the day before that I don't even remember making and it's just nothing but nonsense."

Could be different from others though."
schizophrenia,euilz11,t3_cgjzqd,1563850618.0,"I stop in the middle of my sentences sometimes because of my word salad. I lose where I am in the conversation randomly, and sometimes what the subject was all-together"
