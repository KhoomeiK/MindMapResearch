ptsd,fdofvke,t1_fdoaqcz,1578604312.0,"Being an individual experiencing musculoskeletal pain through every part of my body, as well as other traumatizing injuries that led to it...there is almost nothing scarier than doctors you spend hundreds of dollars on and put your faith into telling you they can't determine anything wrong. Sadly you need to be as aggressive as possible in order for most doctors, especially a lot of washed-up males, to truly put in the time and work. It's even worse when they look at you and treat you like you're crazy."

You were emotionally manipulated by someone who knew how to take advantage of your emotional state at the time and is, in likelihood, sociopathic. Your self-hatred and grief are a lot to unpack, and it will be a major wound to heal, but if you surround yourself with the help you need, things will start to get better."

ChoosingBeggars,fdm8baf,t3_elvug2,1578542290.0,"Given how reddit seems like quite a popular place to chant on and idealize free healthcare, I'm pretty surprised by the reactions this post has received. Seems like everyone is skipping the little detail of him/her having lost a young child and the grief is likely turning them aggressive. A want for someone to blame. It doesn't justify being mean to the vets but unless I'm missing something, I don't see any targeted meanness. This is just a grieving person misdirecting their sadness, and now reddit puts a spotlight on them. Nice."
