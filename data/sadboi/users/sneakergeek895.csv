yoga,fkek55k,t3_fhpowk,1584114849.0,"You are so, so, so wonderful and wholesome. I'm glad to hear that yoga has brought you peace, and that you're enjoying it so much!

Like what most of the other comments said, the yoga community as a whole is incredibly supportive and open. We're not going to judge someone (of any gender or sex) for wearing or not wearing whatever the hell they want in class. You're going to sweat, you're going to occasionally make weird sounds (hell, I squealed the first time I went into triangle pose), and you're going to occasionally, accidentally glance at someone's butt. That doesn't make you weird or gross or creepy. 

Besides, when you're doing yoga, you really need to be physically present--otherwise you're just going to fall over. At least, that's what happens to me anytime I think about ANYTHING ELSE other than what pose I'm doing lol. So people don't really assume that a man (or anyone) in the class is going to stare at their ass and be weird. That's just not the nature of the class. We're all doing our own thing; we're all focusing on ourselves and our body. That's part of why yoga is so wonderful. 

If you're able to, I would suggest examining these concerns and making peace with them. They come from good intentions, and I applaud you for being aware of how you might affect others--that's a skill not many people have or choose to use in today's society. At the end of the day, though, it's an exercise class. Be you, wear whatever you're comfortable in, and know that's totally okay if you're the only guy in the class. 

I wish you well on your journey <3"
zoloft,fkejcnb,t1_fkbb1c8,1584114387.0,"It has, actually! I'm feeling sooo much like my old self, it's crazy. The panic attacks have almost completely gone away, and I feel normal most days. I feel all of my moods again, and that's so amazing. 

The only thing that hasn't changed is the nightmares. They're still there almost nightly, which sucks. But if that's the only thing I have to deal with, then I say it's been worth it. 

I do have some side effects. Like, my stomach is -not- happy with the medication. I have to be careful about what I eat (which I do anyway, I have a lot of stomach issues as it is), and I need to eat something with the medication. My sex drive has dropped a little bit, but not nearly as bad as when I was on Lexapro. 

Overall, the zoloft at 50mg has been near-perfect for me. Thanks for asking :)"

These are really strange side effects, and I think it's a good idea for you to speak with your doctor about this! You're taking the right steps to be healthy. 

Transitioning to zoloft can be hell, and we all have our own experiences with it. For me, I had panic attacks like crazy for the first two weeks, and my stomach is still weird and gets upset easily--seven weeks later.

I would also talk with your psychiatrist and/or therapist (assuming you have one or both..?) about the effects, and also about how you've missed work because of it. 

I hope you feel better soon. You can reach out to me if you wanna talk at all while you're going through this. <3"

You're not alone here. You are safe. You are loved. You are supported."
personalfinance,ffg1iqv,t3_et08dc,1579896434.0,"Let's break this down:

1. Hide your credit cards right now and do not use them. At all. No exceptions. 
2. Do you have anyone in the area you can ask for emotional support? I would go to them before anything else and talk about all that's been happening. Get it out of your system.
3. So it sounds like you're saying this was due to mental health issues for the most part. That's okay. It happens to the best of us; I managed to get myself into $5,000 in credit card debt last year from a bout of depression. This is the underlying cause, so we want to get help for this first and foremost. If you're able to, I suggest you find a therapist to work with. If your family is able to help out at all for medical expenses, ask them. I know it's not always possible. 
4. Once those are all set, gather your support network (whoever that includes), be completely honest about your situation, and ask for any aid or support in helping to find a job. Start searching. And if you have to get a part-time job as a barista or a retail person while you look for a more permanent form of employment, that's what you have to do. It sucks, but it's necessary right now. 
5. Create a serious budget. Figure out your monthly expenses and determine every single thing that you can cut down immediately. I live in NYC, too, and I know it's so difficult trying to just get by. So. Some tips: Trader Joe's is the cheapest grocery store ever, use them; if you're not already living with people, it's time to find some roommates and/or cheaper rent; cancel any subscriptions you're not using; limit your ""fun"" spending to maybe $100/month, max. You've got to put in the work to get yourself out of this. 
6. Once that's all done, you can figure out exactly how much you can afford to pay per month on your credit card bills. This is all dependent on your income (once you find a job) and your monthly expenses. I can't tell you personally how long it'll take you. For myself, I've been paying $450/month toward my credit card with a $48,000/year salary. I'm now almost finished paying it off a year later. You might be able to do more, you might be able to do less. 
7. Once these are all paid off, good god close out all of your credit cards except for the oldest--you need some credit history. 

It's going to be a lot of work, and it's going to be hard. But I know you can do it. You live in NYC, and that means you have some grit. Use it, and dig yourself out of this situation. And remember--don't be afraid to ask for support from friends, family, therapists/counselors and anyone else. I believe in you."

chaoticgood,fdomih5,t3_embmgo,1578608168.0,"Here's the thing. 

Is it good that he's killing people? Probs not. 

Is it good that he's standing up for those who are victims of rape in an area of the world where rape is commonplace (and is on the rise, according to the article)? Yes, but again see the first point. 

A lot of people are pointing out that these suspects haven't even been confirmed; that's the first issue. Victims, during gang rape, may not remember who their attackers were. Rape is a terrifying, traumatic situation, and it can often lead to the survivor forgetting parts of what occurred during it--this is common in most traumatic situations. So. He may possibly be killing innocent people. Problem number one. 

Problem number two is more of a moral, grey-area thing: should people be killed for a crime? That's a wish-washy situation, and it depends on your personal stance. Should it be up to a single individual to determine that a criminal should die, however? I don't think so. 

That all being said: this guy is really bringing to light the horrifying truth that gang rapes are still happening (and at an alarming rate) in his area of the world. Even in reading through the article, it seems as though the rights groups involved over there are more worried about the killings than they are about the victims. Maybe this is just how the author of the article chose to write it... but this ""Hercules"" is standing up for women who are being attacked. And, in that, I think he has the right idea. Just... not the right action. 

My moral compass/civilian standpoint on the situation: Hercules is not doing the right thing, he's putting people in harm's way who may be innocent, and he's taking the law into his own hands, which no single individual should be allowed to do. While he may mean well, he's only doing more harm. 

My standpoint in terms of having been a survivor of rape (and all the fallout and trauma that comes with that): This guy is a fucking hero. So many asshole rapists get to go on with their lives with absolutely no fucking consequences; he's making sure they do. 

Regardless of how you choose to view the situation, there are two points we have to agree on:

1. He's standing up for what he believes is right, regardless of how unlawful his actions may be.
2. This is the embodiment of [chaotic good](http://easydamus.com/chaoticgood.html). ""A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him.... He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society. Chaotic good can be a dangerous alignment when it disrupts the order of society..."""

So, for me, it's: daily face wash from Origins for combination skin plus a retinol cream to prevent acne. I'll occasionally use a light moisturizer, especially in the winter, because my face can dry out. But that's it. No exfoliants. No toners or serums or high-end this or that. Sometimes I'll do a cheap clay face mask, but that's more for fun than anything. My partner works at Estee Lauder, and he agrees that most products are totally overpriced and unnecessary.

So, play around and see how you feel with different types of products. Since you're 30, you probably don't have to worry about acne as much, right? So maybe just focus on a combination face wash, a daily moisturizer with SPF, and a cheap retinol cream for nighttime. 

Also, try to find a really low maintenance hair style and hair cair routine. I don't know about you, but I -hate- spending a lot of time on my hair. Ugh. I use neutral henna as a hair mask once a month to strengthen my hair, reduce frizz, and relax my waves a little more, and I use sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. That's really it. I have to trim my bangs up once a month or so, but that's really it. 

Otherwise: keep your nails trim; remember to hydrate so you feel and look good, and aim to exercise at least three times a week. Just thirty minutes can do the trick. 

Best of luck!"

ptsd,faodj5g,t3_ea5ir8,1576261985.0,"I try to avoid any sugar before bed so it doesn't make my sleep more restless (and it sometimes increases my dreams). If you're looking for a simple, easy, daily thing: tea specifically meant for sleep -can- be helpful, but not always. The ones with valerian root in them are most effective. 

For myself, if I've already had a rough day (read: panic attack) and know I'm not going to sleep well, I take a prescribed Xanax. It knocks me out, and I don't have any dreams (or maybe I do, and I don't remember them). But that's really not to be used on the daily--it's hella addictive. 

Have you spoken with your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist about different possibilities?"

personalfinance,fao8k1s,t1_falli8m,1576259352.0,"So I'm looking to attain an MS in Media Management from a well-known institution in NY. The total cost of this program (a full excel sheet and 30 minutes later) would come to just below $70,000 total. This is for the entire program, all tuition, all expenses, assuming no major changes in price (which, we really can't be too certain on, can we?).

The program covers media, marketing, advertising, and communications. My Bachelor's education didn't cover much of the business or marketing side, and I'm trying to reach better, higher-paying positions. In terms of goals, I'm aiming to reach a Director of Marketing position in the next ten-twelve years. I think this degree could help me reach that.

My employer is unable to provide loan reimbursement. That being said, I would be working full-time, so I could pay for a portion of it as I'm going through the program. I'm also uncertain of how much financial aid I might receive at this point.

I'm trying to determine if the potential ROI of this degree is worth X amount in loans. For myself, I really would prefer not to take out anything more than $20,000 in loans total. I think going above that wouldn't be the best situation. But maybe that's too low, maybe that's too high."

So many people need to hear this throughout the year, but I think it's especially necessary around the holidays (and during that NaNoWriMo run...). I was so hyped to do NaNoWriMo myself this year, and I got six days in just fine. But then work stress, applying for a master's program, beginning a new medication, and suddenly finding myself with a sinus infection.... I just couldn't do it. And I was so angry at myself for a solid week, especially because my partner is currently going through NaNoWriMo (and he's killing it because he's amazing, and I 'm so proud of him, but damn I feel like I'm not living up to the same standards right now). 

So, thank you. And I hope you're able to heal and feel better again from whatever occurred this past weekend, internet stranger. You're a good soul."

God damn, it would be nice if we could just be like, ""aha, but this happened for a *reason*."" But it didn't. Or maybe it did and we won't ever know. Either way, it really doesn't matter.

What matters is your trauma, your pain, your experiences are valid. What you went through was horrible. And I'm sorry it happened. I don't know if you'll ever get full closure, whatever that means for you. But I do hope, for your sake and your sake only, you do find closure somehow. I hope you have days where you're able to forget your diagnosis because you just feel... *good.* I hope you find people who support you and won't ask you to find ""meaning"" in what happened, they'll just ask what they can do to help, even if that means just sitting with you.

toastme,f6pwgn1,t3_ds2ytm,1573065776.0,"I got a lot of the same questions from a bunch of you! So here's my run-down:

* It is YA fantasy (there is **no** god awful, romantic subplot)
* It took me two years to put the story into written form. I came up with the idea in 2017, and I didn't actually start writing it until April of this year.
* I literally had no social life during the time I wrote it--I barred myself away and just kept writing.
* Writer's groups are amazing! I was a part of a couple local ones for a few months during my time working on this story, and the support is sooo wonderful. Also, you get to meet a bunch of other neat people.
* My writing approach is much like all of my hobbies in life: I obsess over one thing for 6-10 weeks at a time, devoting literally all of my free time to that one thing. Then, I completely stop and forget about it for a bit. Then repeat.
* As for starting a novel: I tend to write the first two or three chapters, then I jump to the major plot turning points and write those. It helps me connect the thread. Also, outlines are your best friend"
