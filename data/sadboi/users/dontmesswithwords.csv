sociology,f14ek3x,t3_d35yqz,1569173396.0,"the education definitely. You'll never like someone who's lying if you've for instance been brought up in a family where honesty is a key value.
 
Then there's the language. If they ""speak your language"" there's more likelihood you'll like them (there was a sociological analysis in France conducted by Pierre Bourdieu that proved this - the teachers like less the children that are from poorer neighbourhoods because their language is different to the one they're speaking - it's still French but it's a different kind, with more familiar words and teachers often consider it as disrespect, although in the end the kid was only tryna answer the question).

there's also the prejudice you can have towards the social group they're in - if the person has a, say, punk style, you'll feel scared if you're from a christian private school and all you ever wear is a uniform. 

but there's also a lot of psychological bias. For instance if in your childhood you've had a trauma linked to, I don't know, people wearing blue shirts, then it's kind of logical that you'll avoid people who wear them since you'll subconsciously dislike them without even thinking about it.

i know there's way more to say but I've written the stuff i thought no one would, hope it somewhat helped:)"
sociology,f14dfi2,t3_d3cy0g,1569172837.0,"oh my god I felt this in my bones... yes, yes, yes. But my sociology professor's advice is not to let the knowledge get in your way (LOL), that you can't be thinking about it too much otherwise it's too depressing. It never worked for me but what I do instead is that I actually look for solutions instead of thinking only about how sad the problem is, i think it somehow still trains my brain the same way without making me this depressed. And if the ethical problem of some kind of norm or habit is just too heavy, I'll stop doing it (for instance i completely stopped judging success the same way i did 5 years ago) - because i hate the hypocrisy of ""i mean i know it perpetuates the inequality but I've always been thinking like that !"""
sociology,f14cax1,t3_d4u231,1569172407.0,"okay I'm like 17 so probably not very educated on the matter but in my opinion you can literally mix sociology with anything. It's still a very young science and it's longing for new ways of working, so I'd strongly encourage you to go for ""your"" way of mixing these if you believe they're consistent. I'd myself love to work as a sociologist later and I'd be glad to work with modern ways of research. If you feel inspired to create something new than definitely go for it, we need these kinds of innovations !"
sociology,f14arhw,t1_f0xwod8,1569171795.0,heyyy would you have a link to the paper you wrote? I'd be really interested in reading it if you don't mind ! ‚ù§Ô∏è
mentalillness,f1449xv,t1_f143ko6,1569169361.0,"i never heard about that though... why would that be only with ketamine? I'm not saying it's impossible, just intriguing"
mentalillness,f142u2k,t1_f142f8g,1569168843.0,no i mean like every trial is unsure to a certain extent
mentalillness,f142brb,t1_f13n39h,1569168654.0,"oh, i think you could call any trial that... i mean that's why it's a ""trial"", we don't know but we try it."
AskReddit,f13f9pj,t3_d7d6fl,1569159503.0,"i don't draw any line, I consider them all as tools that could be useful at any point in my life. For instance, i smoked cigarettes and although i was technically addicted to them, they helped me survive the crazy pressure at school. Weed and psychedelics kind of ""happened to me"" (i didn't seek them but they ended up developing my personality immensely) etc. I'm the of person who tries stuff and if they get addicted, they go through the addiction knowing that there's a lesson to learn. The terminology of ""drug"" is, to me, obsolete (although i know we need a word to describe the matter, still with the history and the connotations the word ""drug"" has, i don't think it really represents what it's supposed to be, anymore). I do think it is important that humans have a clue what could and could not affect their body and mind in the stuff they're ingesting. But then, more substances (like sugar, for instance) should be considered drugs."
mentalillness,f13e0kx,t1_f136q6n,1569158854.0,I'm sorry what does quackery mean ? (I'm still learning english lol I'm sorry)
mentalillness,f13dai0,t1_f1362mg,1569158514.0,"honestly i don't but i definitely recommend 'The Drug Classroom' 's youtube channel , it shares consistent research on the matter. I think the trials depend on the country and I believe the information depends on the country. I'd research the key words ""ketamine"", ""depression"", ""pharmaceutical trial"", and probably something about volunteering. You can also contact a company directly, they'll probably give you the info you need. I'll update if I find anything:)"
mentalillness,f12hica,t3_d7ligh,1569140476.0,"you could sign up to a ketamine depression treatment trial. It's been proven to work with resilient depression, helping to break the pattern where antiD's don't help..."
mentalillness,f0zar18,t3_d7ad3q,1569090686.0,"okay so this might sound stupid since I'm literally a 17 year-old teen and all I'm struggling with is depression and anxiety, but maybe this could help. 
I know it's exhausting. I know it's hard, physically and emotionally draining. It hurts and it's scary, scary because you don't know if she'll recover, you don't know if she'll be around in five years, you don't how it affects your daughters. You just know it's a terrible situation, and you know you're in deep - and that is a scary thought. 
But hear me out.
She'll get there. She'll get better. But for that she needs all of you to believe in her. 
Be there. Love her. Smile when you see her. Hug her just because you want her close. Love her in her mess just like you loved her on her bright days. She might be in too deep to know that all of it is going to teach her something, but you know. Your daughters know. When you talk to her, know that she isn't her illness. Know that it's still the same person you married, and that that disorder isn't her. Because mental illnesses have this specificity to convince you that there's no you without them, and so you and your disorder become one. It is a chemical imbalance, yes, but it's one that puts a filter on the way you see the world and you get so used to it that you forget that there's even a filter. You have to implicitly remind her (implicitly, please don't make her feel like she's crazy or annoying in a ""you're just depressed"" way) that her self is not the disordered one. Talk to her like you see her. Like you 'know' she's somewhere underneath all that sadness and emptiness. Don't insist, don't say it out loud. Say it with your eyes, or your touch,or your smile. She has to feel it, not hear it. And reassure her that you care. On an every. day. basis. Kiss her forehead. Hug her tight. If you make her food, make a heart-shaped pancake or whatever cute ways you can find, honestly. Make her feel those happy chemicals because you love her. You two love each other and love transcends everything. It transcends the hard times, even when their source seems too deep to reach. It's hard on the both of you but you guys can make it there. 
There will be moments when she'll tell you to leave her alone. There will be times where you'll feel like it's hopeless and times where loving her will be exhausting, times where seeing her underneath that stupid disorder will be harder than ever. Don't give up. She'll be grateful for that forever. If you need strength think of your daughters. They'll be looking up to you so much knowing how hard it is for you yet still investing every single remain of your energy into that woman you love. They will be witnessing the reconstruction of a wrecked relationship, and a wrecked human being. They will see how their mother's smile lights up a bit more every day, and most of all, they will know that that... is love. Even if it's just a caring kind, they will know. Even if it's a love that's sometimes hard, they will know it's there because children (even teenagers, believe me;) can sense that. They will see you not giving up on someone you love and they will, just like you, learn. They will know you're doing everything you can and believe me, they'll support you in their own small ways. Take all the support you can - you'll need it. But believe in your wife. Believe in your love. Y'all will make it. Love her in your own little, maybe sometimes stupid ways, she'll see it. she'll feel it."
