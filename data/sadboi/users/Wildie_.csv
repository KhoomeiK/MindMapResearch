They have put together a booklet on how to cover the cost of their transformative plans:

https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Funding-Real-Change-1.pdf

That isn’t to say it will be easy. Far from it. You mentioned some of the real challenges in your comment. Maybe it’s also not entirely possible? At the very least it’s a powerful vision though and very aspirational. Surely we can do better than food banks, rising homelessness and a shaky NHS. This is all very strange for me as I don’t feel at home with any of the parties and have voted various ways at different times in my life but I do feel that this time round Labour has some great ideas. Torys - get Brexit done. Lib Dem - stop Brexit. Labour - referendum with Brexit option and a boat load of ideas on how to tackle the many challenges we face. That’s how this election feels to me right now. 

I have to run but I will get back to some of your other points when I can"
ukpolitics,f8b6jsz,t1_f8b4tmv,1574428613.0,"I agree. Labour’s whole campaign is built on trying to broaden the conversation. If that fails, they fail. But so far I’ve been impressed, especially by the manifesto."

simpleliving,f6lt646,t1_f6gawic,1572960106.0,"I tentatively started about 5 years ago but would only meditate sporadically. It wasn’t until just over two years ago that I decided I wanted to commit to a daily habit. It’s since evolved into a twice daily routine, first in the morning as soon as I wake up after opening the curtains, and then later in the afternoon or evening depending on my schedule. 

It’s hard to put into words just how much of a positive impact it has had on my life. I feel so much more at peace with myself. I understand myself so much more. I tend not to get pushed around so much by the waves of emotion that we tend to experience. I’m less stressed. I’m more compassionate and understanding. I’m way more present and in the moment, especially with others. 

It has also helped me through some traumatic experiences, particularly a bereavement. 

I always fear that people get put off by the perception of it. Like it’s some spiritual mumbo jumbo. But I can only report on my experience and how it has helped me. It can also be a real challenge at times. Frustrating even. But if you keep it up I am sure that over time you will begin to experience a better sense of well-being in your day to day life.

Happy to offer advice on where to start if you need it."
simpleliving,f6g23tq,t3_dr7ytz,1572820864.0,Meditation as soon as I wake up. Then meditation  again later in the afternoon or evening. Transformative over time.
bipolar,f66g5z0,t1_f5t4jc7,1572710475.0,"Really sorry for the super slow reply. 

Re: exercise. Sounds like you have a lot on your plate! I wonder if there’s anything you could do that would involve the family. If you have children swimming could be a good option as you can all go together. Bouldering too depending on their age. Both totally different experiences but could be a nice way of getting the heart rate up a few times a week. 

For journaling, I don’t put any pressure on it at all. No pre conceived notion about what each entry has to be. I just put the date at the top of the page and just let myself write. Sometimes it’ll be pages and pages, other times it’ll just be a sentence. I find it to be a good way of getting a little bit of objectivity of my experience and it also allows me to get a clearer idea of what I’m going through publicly and privately. It doesn’t have to be heavy at all unless you feel you need to get something off your chest. In the moment it just is what it is, but then when you go back you can start to track your experiences a little easier and you can notice external factors that may have prompted a depressive or manic/hypomanic episode. The more information I have about myself and my experience the more I feel I understand myself. 

Do you tracks your moods?"
bipolar,f5svdwm,t3_dp70p5,1572444125.0,"Sounds like you’re making a good decision trying to limit some of those destructive behaviours. I was in the same position a couple of years ago. It’s important to not be too hard on yourself if you make a minor slip up. Keep your eye on the long term goal - more stability and therefore more contentment, but also just try and stay present in the to day. I started exercising quite a lot, it’s a good way of disposing of that negative internal energy that would sometimes lead to me to do stupid stuff or over indulge. It’s become a major hobby of mine. Maybe find something new you’d like to try, preferably something that can be communal. Doesn’t really matter what it is. Something that’s positive and regular that you can keep a focus on and enjoy. Do you see a counsellor? That’s always been very helpful to me. I also keep a pretty regular journal so even if I feel the need to act out or binge I can kind of check myself and consider the consequences before diving head first into something destructive."

Just less pizzas and burgers and more fruit, vegetables and fibre. I also keep a mood diary as well as a general journal. Right now I would just try changing one small thing. One step at a time. Maybe try and cook a new recipe today, something a little healthier than you’d normally go for. You could also try a short meditation. 5 minutes or so.

The Benn bill is not sabotage. It is just safeguarding us against a no deal scenario which there is no majority for.

The previous withdrawal agreements were flawed and were voted down as a result. 

I don’t see sabotage anywhere. I see the reality of Brexit being incredibly difficult to parse and manage. Whichever way we leave it will impact the lives of us all for generations. We have to get it right. So far it is clear that our current relationship with the EU is better than the other options that we have negotiated. It is up to Boris and his negotiators to change that. 

The language he used today was shameful. Ultimately, in order to get a deal through he will have to build consensus. I cannot see that happening if he continues to dodge responsibility and to use such inflammatory language."

They were so fun to watch last year because of the energy around the team and the camaraderie. Kyrie is a difficult character by all accounts and it might take a little while for all the new players to adjust to playing together and the system. I definitely think they’ll win more than the 42 they did last year though. I reckon a battle for fifth with the pacers is the most realistic projection.
