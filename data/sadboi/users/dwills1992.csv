schizoaffective,fkrjddu,t3_fka6fo,1584470016.0,"Hi, 

My names Don (27M) im also schizoaffective bi-polar type and the only tips i have is to try to do your best to own your diagnosis. You have to take each day one day at a time and make your best effort to live a fulfilling life. Take your medication on time and try to do plenty of self care. Exercise is important for proper blood flow and hydration is also key to making your medication work at its best. 

Im taking strattera for adhd, and lamicatal and abilify for my schizoaffective and bi polar. Not sure what meds they are gonna prescribe you but if possible take as few as possible. There are also groups out there that you can attend that can help with feeling like your not alone. Im in an intensive outpatient care management group through kaiser and its been on of the best experiences in my life. I also see a therapist every two weeks to talk about how things are going. 

Good luck to you young lady and I wish you nothing but the best. God bless üòä"

schizoaffective,fjffxmi,t3_fcywyp,1583290987.0,You got this! Do ya thing and be proud of how far you‚Äôve come.
schizoaffective,fjb5qzq,t3_fcjs1e,1583187024.0,"Hey,

Glad to hear you‚Äôre doing well and doing things to keep you happy and healthy. I have an almost exact experience with my schizoaffective disorder. I was also hospitalized, arrested and other stuff. I‚Äôm also on disability but live with my wife and our pets. I‚Äôm doing a lot better than I was 2 years ago and I‚Äôm going to the gym, and plan on going back to school. 

Taking medication helps but its all about making positive lifestyle changes and practicing good self care. Overall, if you take it one day at a time and lean on your loved ones for support you can survive in this crazy world. Thanks again for joining the community as its a good place for us to vent and share similar life experiences. All the best to you in your life journey. God bless!"
schizoaffective,fj83y47,t3_fbeg0t,1583104612.0,"Glad to see so many of you doing good. Keep up the good work and try to stay motivated as best you can. Dealing with our mental illness is an everyday, every hour and every minute struggle but if you work on the fundamentals and stick to medication, exercise and just taking good self care you will make it through the day. 

Just a check in for myself I‚Äôm also in an intensive outpatient management group and was just recently prescribed Strattera for my ADHD symptoms. Hasn‚Äôt been a week but it seems to be working well and I can stay focused on things for more than a minute ( it was really bad before). looking forward to long term use and seeing how it effects my ability to think critically so that I can return to school and focus on information technology support which is something I‚Äôve been working in for almost 7 years now. Just lacking a degree. 

Anyways, hope you all have a blessed Sunday and take good care of yourself. :)"

schizoaffective,fipj2gr,t3_f94tcl,1582608471.0,Try taking some energy supplements and going to the gym. I have more energy and have been working out so thats good for us with schizophrenia cause the blood flow is important for our medication to work. Also drink plenty of water.
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,fikm9ef,t3_f86nww,1582483009.0,Is this on PC? Cause the graphics are way better than on my PS4.
schizoaffective,fi5vqxy,t3_f6eagg,1582171669.0,"Hey,

I know how you feel with the medication taking away from your personality and creativity. It‚Äôs a hard thing to deal with and I‚Äôm still trying to find a way to combat that side of my medicine as well. Im learning in my Intensive outpatient casement management group that learning to accept things for how they are and moving on will make a big difference in life. You don‚Äôt have to like how something is but if you accept it at face value then you can hopefully make your way past it and focus on what‚Äôs important. Like being creative and working on goals for yourself. 

Living with schizophrenia and bi polar means that we are generally pretty smart and creative people but medication used to treat our symptoms sometime interfere with the basic functionality of our mind that people would consider ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Overall i think if you can find a good method for you and do whats makes you healthier and happier then thats what you need to do. The rest will come later. P.S. going to some kind of group or being around people who can share similar experiences will help a lot as well. best of luck to you as make your way through life. :)"
computers,eypcd1f,t3_cxzf0p,1567296070.0,Yeah like most of the comments I would say its best to build your own pc. It‚Äôs the best experience ever and comes in handy if you want to persue a career in IT. Good luck to you my man!
depression,eypbe3b,t3_cxyn4e,1567295296.0,Great job man! Keep up the good work! Depression is a constant battle but if you keep trying and find ways to distract yourself you‚Äôll make it through.
24hoursupport,ex4cibt,t3_crbo7n,1566002575.0,Yes you can. Its just a simple AC cable used to power almost anything. You can definitely use it for a computer.

depression,ew5pjo7,t3_cmzdqf,1565141947.0,"Hey Guy or Girl,

It‚Äôs okay. Just try to look at all the positive things in your life and definitely do not feel too afraid to seek mental help and support. I know how it feels to want the world to end but if you keep trying and do your part to get better, things eventually will. Good luck to you and all your future endeavors and god bless you. Stay strong. üôèüèæ‚ù§Ô∏è"
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,etb8qc4,t1_etb6l3r,1562639908.0,Sounds like they need to release a patch for intel processors maybe? I play on PS4 but used to be an avid Pc gamer and ran into similar issues with older titles but I don‚Äôt know about this one. ü§î
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,etb694o,t3_catotb,1562638081.0,Might need better cooling in your CPU. Try water cooling or better thermal paste. Also check your bios and make sure your CPU clock settings aren‚Äôt to high. I would check all background processes to make sure nothing else Is draining your CPU usage while running AC:Odyssey. But you can also make sure you have the latest patches and updates on your computer. Good luck and happy gaming.
offmychest,ersvmcm,t3_c3kg5y,1561225374.0,Awesome for you man! I feel like child hold nostalgia is really important. Even for adults. I recently starting watching Avatar: the last Airbender and Legend of Korra . It makes me happy after a long stressful day. Do what makes you happy. Everyone else will.
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,erm537p,t3_c2h732,1561006444.0,Beautiful snap man! Put 100+ hours in  and really enjoy the amount of content in this game. Aside from God of War‚Äôs approach to lore and mythology this has got to be the most in depth look at greek mythology in a long time. With a beautiful graphical approach.
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,eq91pma,t1_eq7ndse,1559882651.0,Yeah I paid $100 too. But with 120hrs of logged playtimes it was worth every penny. Hopefully they continue the RPG style of assassins creed moving forward.
