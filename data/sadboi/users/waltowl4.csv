There is a balance between punishing and reforming criminals, as well as protecting the public.  

WA became the first to pass innovative civil commitment law specifically for violent sex offenders. California, Wisconsin and New York, among others, later followed. Such ""predator laws"" focused on risk assessment and prevention of re-offending. It is a concept that the general public may not be aware exists.

The Supreme Court has upheld the use of such laws when the individual goal is rehabilitation, not further ""punishment."" But it has another, broader purpose. 

The primary goal is incapacitation, that is, protecting society from people who are predicted to be dangerous in the future,"" said Eric Janus, author of ""Failure to Protect"" and dean at William Mitchell College of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota.

unpopularopinion,fpp2267,t3_gehksm,1588794598.0,"In the US, the animal's fate depends on:
(1) The local legislation;
(2) The species;
(3) The circumstances surrounding the incident. 

1: Many States have two-strike legislation, where problem animals are either relocated or released on-site and monitored. They're then euthanized if they kill another person. 

Many States, however, insist upon euthanizing problem animals and testing them for rabies. 

Where a State hasn't passed legislation, an agency may be liable for releasing an animal that goes on to kill a second time. Thus, they are incentivized to kill the animal. 

2: Where a species overpopulates an area, euthanasia is often the only realistic option, as agency resources and relocation options are limited. Also, if the animal is a predator, it is in the public's interest to reduce the population. This is the case with alligators and pythons in Florida. 

3: Frequently, any witnesses are asked questions and their responses allow the agency to determine whether the animal poses a threat or whether, as in OP's example, the victim was at fault. 

Education is the biggest thing. Until people are educated about not feeding a moose or petting an alligator, wildlife agencies will have no choice but to euthanize animals in many situations."

bipolar,fp1zvhv,t3_gau8ze,1588252095.0,"I'm Bipolar 1 and (like many of us in this category) have a long history of LSD use - 20 years since my first trip.

Firstly, I don't support using LSD while on Lithium because lithium dramatically, and I mean DRAMATICALLY increases the effect of LSD. 

Secondly, if you do try this combination you should consider getting the Lithium out of your system by not taking it for 5.5x its half-life. 

Third: If getting the lithium out of your bloodstream isn't possible for you, try microdosing the LSD. 

I've actually done the microdosing with no negative effects, but again I don't recommend it. 

There's also research on this subject. Here is an excerpt from the study: 

Chronic tricyclic antidepressant administration was associated with subjective increases in physical, hallucinatory and psychological responses to LSD. Similarly, subjects receiving lithium chronically also reported increases in their responses to LSD. In contrast, subjects who had been chronically taking an monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor reported subjective decreases in the effects of LSD. This is similar to a previous report by our group of a decreased response to LSD in individuals who were chronically taking serotonin-selective antidepressants. These altered responses to LSD most likely involve differential changes in central serotonin and dopamine receptor systems and are consistent with other recent data suggesting that the clinical efficacy of different classes of antidepressants may not necessarily rely on a common mechanism of action in the brain."
