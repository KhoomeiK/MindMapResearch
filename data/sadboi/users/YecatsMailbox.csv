MOD team is the easiest job I've had in the company. You are timed, but you are mostly only responsible for yourself. Whether I've been stocking or on cap 2 or a DM, I've ALWAYS had to pull the weight of other people. On the MOD team, it's very rare that's the case. In fact, I've just started, so I'm not the best. I'm also kind of a weak female so sometimes I need help moving certain shelves if they're stuck, etc. so I'm asking a lot of favors and tips along the way, but my team is very helpful in that regard and I'll do whatever I can to help them out too.   
As long as you follow the blueprint and then notify your supervisor or ASM if things are not working out properly via blueprint and find a good solution, you'll be fine. I'm the MOD team but because they know my stocking strengths they routinely pull me to stock areas instead... so expect to be pulled. Often my support manager's plan is overridden by what other managers want done anyway.   


If your store is closed at night, the difference will be ""night and day""... No customers in the way, no one pulling you to ask additional questions, not as fast paced as being a DM whatsoever. Definitely more relaxed. Some big mods will drop, things will entirely change locations, you'll be surrounded by an organized or disorganized mess depending on your team... but in the end, it's like a fresh reset of an area and it leaves a bigger feeling of accomplishment than I ever had in any other role in the company. Good luck."

My replies earlier were downvoted into oblivion for saying the guy was probably just being smart by not wasting his money on useless crap. I asked my bf's opinion and I see he has a point and a good thought about differences in how OP and BF may perceive the situation:   


"" Yeah, I don't think anybody here is. From the BF's perspective, I think he just looked for something that he thought she'd like, which in fact she did, and it not costing much is an added bonus. From the sound of it, I think if he had wanted to get her that ring to make her happy then he would have paid more for it if necessary. So in his mind, ""I got yours off of Amazon for $20"" probably means ""You liked the ring I got for you, right? That one didn't cost so much, and I think it's stupid to buy something expensive just in order for it to be expensive, rather than something you like."" In her mind though, this probably sounded like ""I just looked for the cheapest thing I could find that I could pass off as an engagement ring,"" which is a way of displaying that this engagement means very little to him and he's ""just trying to get that part over with."" Both of their viewpoints on that statement are valid and I don't think either one here did something wrong or felt something unjustified. Of course, I don't know either one of them so I can't really say this with certainty. It's true that this can seem as a trivial thing and bringing it up may make her sound greedy and spoiled, but I do think she should take some time to figure out why she was hurt by this and talk to him about it, while also making sure he understands that she does love the ring he got her and that it's (I assume) more precious to her than a random $3,500 ring because it's the one he gave her to signify his love for her.

13ReasonsWhy,f6dvw8y,t1_f6c998t,1572797459.0,"I'm saying technically speaking, the term being used is incorrect. -_- Nothing more, nothing less. 

I got my definition from Merriam-Webster. Your definition from Oxford still amplifies the same point... ""children."" 

Pedophilia or paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children, generally age 11 years or younger. As a medical diagnosis, specific criteria for the disorder extends the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13. A person who is diagnosed with pedophilia must be at least 16 years of age, but adolescents who are 16 years of age or older must be at least five years older than the prepubescent child before the attraction can be diagnosed as pedophilia.

Hebephilia is the primary or exclusive adult sexual interest in pubescent individuals approximately 11-14 years old, and is one of several types of chronophilia (sexual preference for a specific physiological appearance related to age). It differs from ephebophilia, which is the primary or exclusive sexual attraction to individuals in later adolescence (generally ages 15-19), and differs from pedophilia,which is the primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children (with the prepubescent age range extending to 13 for diagnostic criteria).

Ephebophilia is the primary or exclusive adult sexual interest in mid-to-late adolescents, generally ages 15 to 19. The term was originally used in the late 19th to mid 20th century. It is one of a number of sexual preferences across age groups subsumed under the technical term chronophilia. Ephebophilia strictly denotes the preference for mid-to-late adolescent sexual partners, not the mere presence of some level of sexual attraction. Some authors define ephebophilia as a sexual preference for pubescent and adolescent boys.

Pederasty or paederasty (US /ËpÉdÉrÃ¦sti/ or UK /ËpiËdÉrÃ¦sti/) is a (usually erotic) homosexual relationship between an adult male and a pubescent or adolescent male. The word pederasty derives from Greek (paiderastia) âlove of boysâ, a compound derived from ÏÎ±á¿Ï (pais) âchild, boyâ and á¼ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ®Ï (erastÄs) âloverâ.
