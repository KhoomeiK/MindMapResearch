LegalAdviceUK,fp5fvnw,t3_gb6rt9,1588327862.0,Sorry I thought I had replied. Ok I see where you’re coming from. Thank you ever so much for sharing your knowledge. God bless you
LegalAdviceUK,fp42fl5,t3_gb6rt9,1588290360.0,Ok so essentially this means that this proceeding is accessible to any member of the public and not necessarily that it will be made a big deal in the media? I would’ve thought cases involving children would automatically be private or at least without revealing their names.
LegalAdviceUK,fp41oxh,t1_fp4199g,1588289951.0,"Hiya,

Thank you for your comment.

I’m sorry if I sound a bit silly but I’m still struggling to figure out what open justice entails? Does this mean that the case will be discussed in the media? My friends a bit nervous of going ahead. Is that what it means to notify the press association? What is the outcome?

Sorry again and thank you."

bipolar,fmfek2f,t1_fmeletk,1586025596.0,"I have no idea. Maybe he thinks I’m usually ok which I’m not. Maybe he thinks I’ll be capable of doing it. Maybe that’s his plan or he thinks that when my life is in an optimal stage with regards to the generic career, marriage and etc I can latch on to a good environment to guide me instead of the medications. No real idea why, just some assumptions that I can think of"

bipolar,fjmwzx1,t1_fjm4nxs,1583488199.0,Thanks for sharing. Yes it would be an amazing feeling. Being able to trust someone to be able to understand you and work towards common goals
bipolar,fjmwyhp,t1_fjlirkr,1583488141.0,Thanks for sharing. I see your point. I feel a bipolar person can understand and make sense of it more than someone who’s not.

bipolar,ffwhi03,t3_eve9ds,1580301186.0,I’m sorry to hear this mate. Are you getting treatment? Most of the year is still to come. You’re not alone. If you can somehow manoeuvre your thoughts such that you are aware of how you are feeling a certain time and then see whether you can divert your thoughts or take a different action. Why don’t you try boxing? You’d feel good punching the bag. I wish you the very best. Please try to keep positive and also keep in mind that your determination can overcome anything.

One the worse things I used to have is severe anxiety, I couldn’t function. I used to get so so self conscious that I wouldn’t even be able to say my name right. On the one hand I was absolutely confident, friendly and outgoing. On the other I was so afraid to even have basic interactions. The worse days were the ones where I was hopeless and so worried that I just used to pace in and out, smoke, lie in bed, try to distract myself. I’ve spent days like that yet I just thought it was something that just happens to me. 😮"

bipolar,feorr6j,t1_feopgrx,1579304501.0,"That’s true. Yes I’m not worried about the past, I accept responsibility where I went wrong but I’m happy that I’m not with my ex. She just wasn’t the right person. Yes of course you should always try everything that you can to help yourself. I was a fighter, I was literally incapacitated by fear, anxiety and paranoia which stopped me from speaking to anyone. I still managed to rise above it at times through gym, positive reading, self motivation. I had no clue that I could not do it just on my own. Towards the end I was so sick of it that I just said ok fine I’ll surrender, I don’t trust the doctors to open up to them but I will. I went and I told the doc everything and now I’m just the best of myself. I kind of missed myself. I need a lot of internal working before I find someone new. That’s also another interesting thing post treatment. Before treatment, I had an incredibly hyper sex drive. I almost feel like I wanted to have sex and that’s it. I always thought of it. After treatment, I have so many normal things to enjoy I barely think of it. It may have been a subconscious coping mechanism or maybe something stemming from being abused as a child. In any case I also never liked being and feeling like a victim. That also stopped me from getting help, I felt weak in getting help along with the paranoia and lack of trust in anyone and anything.

I know where I went wrong and I know that I tried my best with all I had at the time. I also know that my ex was a toxic person and possibly the worse person to be with in this condition. I’m looking forward to an exciting future but even if not, it’s not the end of the world."
bipolar,feof35v,t1_feodibh,1579299238.0,"Yes that’s true and I agree with you. I don’t condone bad behaviour at all. What I struggle to understand at times is that if a mental illness could be seen as a physical visual illness let’s say like a broken leg, would you be looked at the same way if you weren’t able to run with a broken leg? It’s literally impossible for a person with mental illness to know how they’re like and what normal is. 

I’m not here trying to prove a point or prove myself  right or argue. I’m presenting to you a possible point with the will to accept logical reasoning."
bipolar,feoe18h,t1_feodc11,1579298823.0,"Yeah we were toxic to each other. Maybe we did love each other at some point, can’t say right now. I was very paranoid and didn’t trust anyone even the professionals to disclose my issues. I never trusted my wife and rightly so because later on she would exploit every weakness she knew of me"
bipolar,feoboo3,t1_feoarbl,1579297799.0,"Everyone is different. I was awful to my wife, she was awful to me. We were bad for each other. She said I was sick but she did everything to make it worse. I told my doctor about what she said and did, he agreed she was horrible. She is sick too btw but she’s undiagnosed. A compulsive liar, a trickster, someone with no integrity, shouting and screaming all the time, a schemer, all the qualities that help you gain trust and confide in her especially when you’re already struggling. I’m no angel either but not “the” baddie in this"

bipolar,fdb25ei,t1_fdaxuwf,1578252878.0,"Nice one. Wow well done for 15 years.

Yeah I don’t think it’s a straight answer, if the meds rewire your pathways. The only way as far as I’m aware to rewire your neurological pathways is to repeatedly do the same thing again and again.

Yes that story is very scary. Ofcourse Id rather be on meds. There are a few side effects of the meds I’m taking for example, I need to go to the washroom frequently mad at night. I get super fatigued as well at times. Sex doesn’t feel that good, orgasming is difficult. I’m not too bothered because after a long time I feel like myself it’s almost like I missed myself.

Things are ok.

Thanks for sharing your insight and personal experience."
bipolar,fdb1k4l,t1_fdaujzh,1578252645.0,"Hey thanks for that. I agree with you on coping mechanisms but the conundrum there is let’s say you’re on meds and you develop coping mechanisms because getting off the meds is a big risk and all the while you’re trying to develop coping mechanisms it may not work, the probability is higher. Ok so let’s say you do develop coping mechanisms whilst on meds then the question is would they still work if you’re off the meds because you can only feel how it feels without meds if you’re off the meds. Not sure if I make sense"
