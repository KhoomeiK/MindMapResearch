I don't know what all of your ages are, but by the time I was 18 I had gotten over the fear of wearing tampons. Especially if she is sexually active there shouldn't be any issue. You put the thing in and stop worrying about it for a few hours, you don't even feel you're wearing one if done properly. 

I think its downright disrespectful of her not to use any products and bleed all over you on purpose. There needs to be a level of mutual respect where you respect she might be in pain or have bloody accidents, but she also needs to make an effort not to have those."
