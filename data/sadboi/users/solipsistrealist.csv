ClashRoyale,fh96ett,t3_f1wr03,1581374180.0,"I agree with you in most of this post with the exception for extending seasons to every 3 months. This seems wise but this will mean that there will have to be more than just 50 tiers. I get to 35 tiers within 2 weeks and I’m sure I’d be able to get to 50 in 3 weeks. 

Also with trophy road, making the seasons 3 months means less rewards for a longer season. Now this can be made up of we have more challenges and with revamping clan wars. 

I suggest we extend seasons to 45 days exactly and if that never lines up on a Monday(where I notice seasons usually reset) it can be slightly longer than 45 days to be reset on Monday’s. Perhaps the pass can be increased to $7 for 45 days too. 

With seeing the tweet regarding SC and the integration of Heroes, I prefer they do more testing and strategizing for how to integrate heroes in clash Royale bc I am sure they will add probably about 3 heroes when they’re introduced at minimum."

2) Changing ID stats would be good and I just don’t think it needs to be nerfed but it’s stats increased
