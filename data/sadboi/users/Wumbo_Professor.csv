schizophrenia,fahnmx1,t1_fagbsr3,1576089614.0,"Not sure, I think ‘flow’ is how they’d use it. I often see that term in Venn diagram type things about how it’s the in between of doing something challenging and doing something your good at doing. 
For me though, I feel flow even when I’m not doing tasks. Like I’ll hear a truck zooming down the street and I just zone in and watch it, like I become ‘one’ with the motion of it lol."
schizophrenia,fafppe5,t3_e8zw8s,1576028787.0,"I thought I was suffering from autistic burnout when my symptoms of depression, amotivation and disorganization set in. I definitely experience the ‘flow’ focused feeling that’s in autism and schizo, like I’m in my own little world. But my bipolar symptoms and overall personality don’t match up with ASD diagnosis, but there’s definitely a common thread"
