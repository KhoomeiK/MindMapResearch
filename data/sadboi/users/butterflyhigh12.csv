virgin,fl7lhka,t3_fn1iz3,1584904211.0,"Yeah I’m having the same exact experience. I’m also 22 F virgin. I just started dating a guy a month ago and I asked him to take it really slow with me. I have extremely bad trust issued and he is such a sweetheart about it. He’s touched me and gone down on me a few times and I’ve touched him for the first time recently but I think it will probably be another month before I am ready to lose it to him. I waited all of my life to find someone I am comfortable with to lose it to them because I can’t lose it to a random hook up. I am starting to really trust him and I am excited for when the time comes for us. 

But no, it’s not weird to wait for that. I only have one other friend who is still waiting for that right person and yeah sometimes it sucks when you can’t relate to conversations about all the places your friends have had sex and shit like that but if you’re not ready , you’re just not ready. Nothing wrong with waiting for your person that you completely trust and feel 100% comfortable with. 

Just trying to speak from experience. Hope this helps. Feel free to message me if you want :)"
ShitNsSay,fkrfkbg,t1_fkraebp,1584467872.0,Yep. I think she would have an aneurism if someone brought up the idea or even slight possibility of a nursing home. No one there to cater to her made-up problems or for her to ridicule!!!

virgin,fkq5kl0,t3_fjpngi,1584431473.0,"I am terribly sorry that has happened to you. Please message me if you want to talk about anything...

I think that if you haven’t had consensual sex that you are still a virgin. The word itself is up to you to decipher, though. It means different things to different people. Some people reclaim their virginity if they want to start over. Some people don’t believe in that. It’s all subjective. Whatever you feel comfortable calling yourself, that is what you are."

virgin,fb4lu6x,t3_eafsy8,1576511362.0,I’m 22 as well. Hopefully this will happen with me in the next few weeks.
virgin,fakw4m9,t1_fakkug6,1576174125.0,"Yeah, I guess I’ve never been in a situation where I wanted it that bad with a guy and it was mutual. Probably because I was scared I didn’t know what I was doing, so I avoided it or tried not to initiate it. It’s an ongoing cycle, Agh!!"
virgin,fakvt6y,t1_fakl7zp,1576173970.0,Yeah I have been before. It never worked out with the men that I was very interested in. They either lead me on until I was fed up or ghosted me. There was one guy who I was emotionally close to but he turned out to be verbally abusive and I couldn’t do it.

I’m reading the comments and why the fuck would this need to be reported to HR? Because she’s ignoring you? What is that going to do??!"
