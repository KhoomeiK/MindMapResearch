depression,fqa8uuu,t1_fq9d0zy,1589214877.0,"This is silly. You can't say everyone who doesn't think the world is shit ""ignorant."" There are good and shit parts to the word. Focusing on the bad will lead to poor mental health, and focusing on the good will lead to a healthier mindset. You're criticising people for wanting good mental health and focusing on the good parts? You want the whole world to be depressed?"
depression,fqa8b4y,t1_fq99ddv,1589214596.0,Are you really calling people with a healthy mental state delusional? Just because you're happy doesn't mean you have no self-awareness
sex,fq86dse,t1_fq85wxa,1589159419.0,Yeah true i can imagine its quite cramped. Maybe its one of those fantasies that sounds hotter in theory
sex,fq84qqq,t1_fq84c51,1589158473.0,"Yeah exactly, if anything its more sanitary since you won't be sitting on a toilet?"
sex,fpislxs,t1_fpirhqj,1588647785.0,"Hahaah. My ex of 1.5 years was never properly dominant/ aggressive like i always said i wanted and said he didnt ""get"" why i would enjoy choking , when that was and is one of my biggest turn ons. He used to get so satisfied from simplistic, plain sex and didn't even realisd i wasn't feeling the same about it."
sex,foy6bpa,t1_foxk50s,1588166311.0,Does he not see that and realise that maybe he should be pleasuring you more?!
sex,fowp3dg,t1_fowhsn6,1588124214.0,One was my ex and then i've had 2 casual encounters who were bad but thought it was really good?
sex,fowozsh,t1_fowh268,1588124156.0,"I don't understand why so many people, especially boys, skip foreplay and go straight into sex? Its obviously no where near as good compared to having foreplay before - how can people not see that?"
BreakUps,fnifeoa,t1_fnierwj,1586979065.0,"That is helpful advice and an interesting story. I have been writing a bit, maybe I should more. Unlike you though i 100% have no hope of reconciliation and dont want to get back with him. Its just the rebound thats bugging me."

im actually doing pretty well as a whole. my breakup happened nearly 4 months ago but its the rebound he jumped into thats been getting me the most. cant help thinking about it at night."
BreakUps,fhvxawq,t1_fhvug6e,1581902571.0,Just read your post about your ex sending that video- WTF
sex,fh7nkv9,t1_fh6sgc1,1581339220.0,Yeah you're probably right. I do tend to only feel comfortable with people if the conversation flows well. I dont think me and this guy would even have a strong connection enough to even watch a movie/eat dinner together- the convo is that poor 😂
sex,fh7nh1t,t1_fh6rpvt,1581339118.0,"I think im the type of person who needs some sort of emotional connection at least, even if its small!"
sex,fh6qyp1,t1_fh6q2ra,1581303934.0,Sounds good. When she arrived how long did you talk for before having sex? Was it awkward initiating it? Did she leave soon after or early the next morning?
BreakUps,ffohq1q,t3_eub8zo,1580077690.0,You're leaving after just 2 months?
BreakUps,ffaaxg5,t1_ffaamjv,1579731326.0,"Really great idea, thank you :)"
BreakUps,ffa8aws,t1_ffa822u,1579729835.0,3 months ago. He got into a relationship with a new girl who looks like me a month ago who he found off tinder. I'm angry at him and strongly dislike him but part of me still wants to keep these things?
BreakUps,feqj3m8,t1_fepoija,1579342499.0,What happened when you rebounded? How long for?
BreakUps,feqiqhn,t1_fepon9q,1579342340.0,I hope so:(
BreakUps,feohtiu,t1_feod2gp,1579300422.0,That sounds tough:( Do you think she might have left you to be with him? So it wasn't a rebound but a monkey branch?
BreakUps,feohg8f,t1_feoe9ca,1579300217.0,"I completely agree with you. I know he's chasing the drug of being in a relationship because he's scared of being loved. And i know for a fact he's bad at grieving. 
But my ex and his new girlfriend seem so suited- more well suited than we were. Maybe they will be long term? But surely the chances of finding 'the one' a month after we broke up is so slim? He had never met her before we broke up"
ExNoContact,femuxs6,t3_epn8tz,1579270281.0,Exactly - and people who go straight into rebounds never learn this lesson
BreakUps,fellvyq,t1_felhfce,1579225293.0,Ngl they seem really similar in a lot of aspects- or is this my brain just telling me to fear the worst??
BreakUps,felk35o,t1_felizm1,1579224074.0,I dont want to sound naive but they seem quite well matched in a lot of ways- is this my brain just telling me this ? Its so unlikely to be long term isnt it?
BreakUps,fehdo5l,t1_fehais6,1579114408.0,Great advice thank you.
BreakUps,fehdjgr,t1_feh76ma,1579114332.0,Looool i wish
BreakUps,feewvkr,t1_feev8oe,1579042963.0,Really like that quote. i agree that almost all these relationships wont last
BreakUps,feert6k,t1_fedu5dt,1579039842.0,How does this seem to be happening with everyone? Everyone's ex (including mine) seems to move on within a month. Are they all rebounds?!
BreakUps,fdp50uz,t1_fdp4mrv,1578620146.0,Cant wait for my ex to feel his!!

BreakUps,fdln9xk,t1_fdlmb3g,1578527889.0,True. My ex seems to click with his rebound but maybe thats show for social media lol
BreakUps,fdln8go,t1_fdllxcw,1578527862.0,"Yeah, fill the void with other things that help you grow within yourself!"
BreakUps,fdlhe2r,t3_elsa94,1578524063.0,Dreading it
BreakUps,fdl78ex,t1_fdjsfeg,1578518225.0,"Hahaha thats weird, there definitely are some similarities. I find that having a fake social media persona is such a turn off - just be real for god sake"
BreakUps,fdjmx76,t1_fdiwac0,1578478663.0,"Some of these really points remind me of my ex on social media
- my ex is a 'music producer' and puts on this cringey, fake, validation seeking tone whenever he posts on social media
- i know that deep down he's worried his music might not work out so he seeks compliments/excessive validation online from his friends, its timsed by 1000x ever since he broke up with me because i didn't support his music enough so i know he's become more insecure about it
- he acts like he's been with his rebound for ages. and that everyone knows who she is when in reality he found her on tinder 3 weeks after our breakup and he's trying to act like they've known each other for ages
- the rate at which he's forced the rebound is unnatural and over the top & looks odd on social media since everyone knows me and him were together for 1.5 years and just split up & were deeply in love
- my ex doesn't have alot going on his life at all - all he posts about is his naive obsession with trying to get 'famous' with his music & fake posts about his rebound (can't be a real relationship as they barely know each other) 
- ideally his relationship will crash in 5/6 months and he'll be forced to grieve our relationship and stop pretending his life is perfect"
BreakUps,fdijv8x,t1_fdiiap7,1578444537.0,Honestly if you think about it 3 months isnt long atall. Id say start worrying after a year. But hopefully by then you wont be concerned about their relationship. Honestly the fact that you cry in front of them is a good thing cos it allows you to open up & process ur emotions about the breakup!
dating_advice,fdif584,t1_fdid6mr,1578441500.0,"Yeah fair enough. i feel like alot of people are convinced that theyre over their exs though and are in denial abit and try and push the fact they arent away to get over it, so it might not be fully clear. But those are good questions to get an idea"
BreakUps,fdif0qz,t1_fdicoxj,1578441419.0,Yeah i used do that. Have you considered therapy by any chance??? i remember you're going through a ' rebound' too. are they still together?
mbti,fdicsbo,t3_el5761,1578439971.0,I cant find the personified versions of other types?!?
dating_advice,fdicjsr,t1_fdicegs,1578439827.0,What kind of questions would you ask to avoid them? Like how recent was your last rela etc?
ExNoContact,fdi9lqf,t3_ek2um5,1578438205.0,This 100% relates to my situation. Checking gives them power !!! It just fucks you up just because you had a little urge of curiosity
BreakUps,fdf8r6a,t3_el0epu,1578355941.0,I've had 4 sessions of counselling and mine has been amazing. It literally puts all your thoughts and issues into perspective and helps you understand you & your ex so much more. I always walk out of each session feeling less pain. I'd 1000% reccomend it
BreakUps,fcw4md7,t1_fcw4esv,1578017033.0,"yeah that is shit. My ex took a load of personal songs we shared and loved & played to each other during our relationship and put them in a playlist for the new girl lol. Apparantly rebounds last on average 3-5 months, but could easily be longer i guess"
BreakUps,fcvuwm3,t1_fcvf4qh,1578010652.0,Rebound!!! same happened to me
BreakUps,fcvpgxk,t1_fct9g3w,1578007152.0,how come you're going through a different type of hurt?
BreakUps,fcvbg9o,t1_fcuo3dx,1577998595.0,"I think theres some psychology behind people choosing to pick rebounds who are opposite to their ex, i think its the idea that if you choose the reverse to ur ex it'll work out cos theyve gone for the opposite, but in reality it doesnt work cos youve picked the person based on a ""reaction "" to their ex rather than true connection"
BreakUps,fcuk8if,t1_fcu59zs,1577982884.0,"Lets hope!!! i think it must, going so fast is so unnatural and forced"
BreakUps,fcstepv,t1_fcsknby,1577924635.0,"looks like we're in the same boat! thank you, and you!"
BreakUps,fcstbke,t1_fcsdkcp,1577924574.0,I have no doubts they like each other. but i dont think how they've gone about their relationship will be strong enough to last
BreakUps,fcsje4m,t1_fcsgjxb,1577917744.0,I dont want him to take me back or anything. I just want him to grieve our relationship and feel pain and maybe want me back a little bit.
BreakUps,fcs1mev,t1_fcrzoky,1577910043.0,"thank you ! this is a really mature perspective to take, because you're right, its not their responsibility anymore to look out for our hurt and they're just doing what they feel best to get over it. He couldve done it alot more respectfully though but i dont think he knows how to handle a long term break up as he hasnt been through one before. i really hope i get less annoyed at him and more positive like you are as i care about it less as time moves on. :)"
BreakUps,fcrya1o,t1_fcrxabf,1577908278.0,wow that sounds really good on your part and sounds so similar to my situation. im really looking forward to the moment where i really dont care about whats happening with him. How did you get to that point?
BreakUps,fcrqslq,t1_fcrq30a,1577905368.0,"Do you think she met him and liked him before she broke up with you and used the distance as an excuse? Not saying that defo happened just an idea. 

And yeah its shit. Im trying not to check his social media but something keeps compelling me to. I just want to fast forward a few months and see that they've broken up and I'll feel so much better with myself knowing that he's finally facing grieving the breakup"
BreakUps,fcrp1ti,t1_fcrocwp,1577904705.0,"Honestly i wouldn't choose to trust how it looks on her instagram over what she's saying. I feel like everything looks so much better on social media than it really is and its easy to believe their rela is alot better than what we had with them but we never know whats actually going on. I found out about the rebound mid december, what about you? He broke up with me end of october and we were together 1.5 years"
BreakUps,fcrny45,t1_fcrls0k,1577904299.0,Yeah i was handling it really well until i found out he was with someone else and it fucked me up. so unfair. i wish he knew how much he was hurting me
BreakUps,fcrl158,t1_fcrk6uz,1577903195.0,Surely if you rush a relationship so quickly it must be forced and not based on a strong foundation?
BreakUps,fcrg5ln,t3_eif5e1,1577901385.0,Good for you !!!
BreakUps,fc1g6j5,t1_fc1dvht,1577317790.0,Really really weird. I think its some insecurity? I feel like they're trying to rehash what they lost in the last relationship and have the same thing/memory with someone new without having the emotional intelligence to realise every relationship is different.
BreakUps,fc16xvj,t1_fc165y0,1577310011.0,That's sad if this is true :/
BreakUps,fc132aw,t1_fc12pt7,1577306843.0,You'd think he would just find new songs? Idk i find it so weird but i get what you mean
BreakUps,fc12g1w,t1_fc1240p,1577306342.0,Ahhh thats so true. You think he's clinging onto old memories?
BreakUps,fc11h4j,t1_fc115xh,1577305549.0,"Yeah i know its weird behaviour since they were such personal songs. A genuine, new relationship would involve new songs that relate to that relationship"

BreakUps,fblqwnq,t1_fblqiyi,1576967969.0,How do u meet new ppl though?? i never meet new ppl when im at the gym
BreakUps,fbhnag3,t1_fbhn3pt,1576877731.0,I just think its really unfair that if his rebound lasts then he is ignoring the healing process and just clutching onto another girl whilst Im suffering! How did you get through it?
BreakUps,fbhal1m,t1_fbh8rwc,1576869133.0,Sounds like a rebound to me
BreakUps,fbhajtn,t1_fbh8rwc,1576869110.0,3 months is not a long time at all. The average rebound relationship lasts 5 months
BreakUps,fbh0uk5,t1_fbgzpe3,1576863036.0,I hope i come out the better person but  he was the one who broke up with me and was pretty certain on it that im worried he'll never actually have a proper grieving process! But youre right i need to focus on myself
BreakUps,fbgypjl,t1_fbgos0b,1576861623.0,I really hope its that way!
BreakUps,fau31l9,t1_fat3i83,1576343871.0,Yeah it sucks doesnt it:(
BreakUps,f9v2l9m,t1_f9ux7d5,1575662030.0,Yeah you're right. I think the true reason is that he just didn't really care for it and didn't want to be reminded of it since its over so wanted to give it away.
BreakUps,f9ux2ac,t1_f9tfhoe,1575659240.0,Why do you think he gave it away? I dont get why he wouldnt want to keep it as a memory?
BreakUps,f9t8a9h,t1_f9sez73,1575612273.0,He broke it off with me cos we have different career goals and ideas about the future. I agreed
ENFP,f5uqo1i,t1_f5uqcri,1572477728.0,Im trying to distract myself as much as I can but its hard when I really love the feeling of being in relationships so much !
BreakUps,f5c3fig,t1_f5c1443,1572129817.0,"Everyone who does sport at my Uni is really competitive which makes me lose interest in it. Ive been going to the gym regularly over the summer but Im finding it really hard to keep at it because it gets boring/repetitive. But yes it does wonders for mental health! Also going to the gym alone I still find a bit lonely.

Im planning on doing a volunteer project in Asia this summer but thats a while away. Ive also got an interview for a new job next week at a trampoline park so hopefully if I get that I could meet new people.

I find it really unfair how he is living with his two parents and has a massive group of friends around him, whereas I'm 2 hours away from my divorced parents and I only have a couple friends. 

I'm trying to clean my room daily now as well to keep busy. 

How many breakups have you been through?"
BreakUps,f5bzy48,t1_f5bz88d,1572128376.0,"Yeah I get what you mean. I think you're right. Its just so hard to resist the urge not to message him.  Especially in the evenings. You're right in the fact that he's in control and I hate it. Because I know that if he was in the hurting position he'd be begging for me to reply etc and its just unfair how he can just ignore me when he feels like it when I wouldn't ignore him if it was the other way around.
How would you recommend I focus on myself when I don't have many friends to like refocus my energy onto? And all the nights out/events/places I used to go to with him."
BreakUps,f5bygnr,t1_f5bxneb,1572127758.0,I definitely don't wanna go away for Christmas alone though. I would go on holiday with a few friends around the christmas period but I don't have many.
BreakUps,f5bxo5w,t1_f5bxfkg,1572127435.0,"True in the fact that the social media persona is different. Also, I keep sending him good night messages and sometimes he replies and sometimes he doesn't. I don't actually mind whether he replies too much just as long as he's seen it. We don't talk much else. Do you think just sending him good night msgs is detrimental to my healing, even if I dont have any false hope in the first place? Ive just been so used to messaging him all day every day for 1.5 years"
BreakUps,f5bx5zx,t1_f5bw3h1,1572127097.0,Yeah i know. But Moscow sounds really good!
BreakUps,f5bx4go,t1_f5bvwjd,1572127065.0,But how do I contact him if I ever want to? By message? Have you deleted your ex?
BreakUps,f5bvpim,t1_f5bto7s,1572126432.0,True. Looking at his stuff is doing nothing but hurting me. I wish I had more friends that I could go out with to distract myself like he does. I might just stop opening his instagram stories.
BreakUps,f5bt02d,t1_f5bst04,1572125512.0,Just to see what he's up to. I'm accepting that we won't ever get back together but I'm just finding the loneliness really hard.
BreakUps,f5bsohx,t1_f5bs7ns,1572125353.0,You really think the best way is to delete his social media? Thats so hard to do
ENFP,etseum5,t3_cczuvi,1563143769.0,"You've managed to capture something so similar to how I feel about social situations.

If I feel ""on top"" of the social interaction, ie, I feel I'm contributing usefully. getting along well with them, sharing similar sense of humour etc I feel so full of energy and I love social interactions and being with people and could go like that on all night

But if I feel like im falling under it and drowning ie. i dont know what to say, its awkward, I feel left out of a group or if I feel that don't get on with someone well enough, I immediately feel very uncomfortable, and then start deepening it as to why I can't feel like I fit in, I feel anxious and sad etc.. and I go home feeling depressed and wondering why I couldnt fit in and ""do well""

I wish I didnt deepen it too and have such high expectations of all social interactions and assuming that i have the ability to be friends with anyone. I wish i could just accept that Im gonna get along with some people but not with others"
