I used to struggle forgiving and sometimes still do . Especially when the person have hurt you intentionally or at least it feels that way.  I have to Remind myself that forgiveness is not about the other person, it’s about yourself permission to get rid of that poison you’re holding inside of you know the old saying hate anger or like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die so just something to think about. Goofy luck on your journey to healing. God a Bless"
