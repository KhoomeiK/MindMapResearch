Ultimately what other standard can we judge things by other than their consequences? From their own viewpoint, mostly everyone does what they feel is ""the right thing"", whether they're helping others, or assaulting them for looking at them wrong.

Ideally what we should do is take the time to communicate, realize each other's wrongs, learn from each other. But much of the time, that goes far beyond anyone's resources. Wrong or right, people get attached to their own versions of reality and opinions on it. And besides you can't effectively argue down entire groups of people who back each other's views up. 

If someone kills another person, it doesn't much matter if they thought it was the right thing to do. If it was in self-defence, that might be excusable because you cannot expect anyone to disregard their own survival, but excusable still doesn't mean ""right"".

Likewise, it doesn't matter if you think that misgendering trans people, or denying the quarantine is right or wrong. What matters is that both lead to people being hurt.

The world isn't a neat flawless utopian place. Sometimes you can't do right without giving up on someone's liberty, be it liberty for something as severe as murder, or as mild as hurting people you won't try to understand, or potentially endangering hundreds of thousands of people. At the end of the day, there's no ""right"" or ""wrong"", there's just desirability and tolerability of its consequences.

You also need to keep in mind someone's existing status and resources. Satirizing a privileged pandemic denialist who's probably pretty full of themselves thinking they know better than all authorities and scientists is a little different from satirizing someone whose identity has already been insulted every other day of their life at best."

From atypical stuff, the supplement combination of **Uridine Monophosphate, DHA fatty acid, and Choline**, can increase both dopamine levels and sensitivity, which can provide a degree of relief from ADHD, as well as **significantly reduce the required dose of medication**, possibly into the tolerable range. **Make sure to supplement vitamins B(in particular 6, 9, and 12)** because the combo can deplete them in the brain which isn't good. Dosages would be, for an ADULT - 300-500mg/day UMP, 600mg+ DHA, 50-300mg/day Choline(on the upper end for ADHD use). 

**Inositol** is another supplement, it can reduce symptoms of obsessiveness, OCD, etc. but probably not ADHD as a whole.

**Selegiline**, rarely used off-label for ADHD, is a well tolerated, highly effective one, too, albeit it requires some considerations to be taken. It inhibits MAO-B which breaks down among others dopamine and phenethylamine(trace neurotransmitter responsible for release of the ""main"" monoaminergic neurotransmitters), but also enhances the secretion of neurotransmitters when neurons fire - similar to Adderall or Vyvanse, but without ""leaking"" the neurotransmitters out while the neurons are at rest.

There is also evidence that supplementation of **magnesium**(some forms of the nutrient more than others) help alleviate ADHD to some degree, as can **zinc**, but *I've not looked into those topics yet.*

I personally have only recently realized that I suffer from ADHD, and have not been medicated yet, but the Uridine stack + Selegiline is what I want to aim for. I consider stimulants to be the last resort, for me.

For raising him, try to channel his energy into physical activity and other healthy activities, to create ""structure"" with reward systems instead of expecting him to just do things that require sustained effort or attention.

dwarffortress,flll07v,t1_flkwtdt,1585262456.0,Yup. This is a purely graphical tweak that would honestly clear things up so much.

TheLastAirbender,flgv518,t1_flbk3ou,1585150911.0,But why won't the next avatar be able to speak with Korra?

That's when I found out that there's this one dopamine related disorder that I had but thought poofed away around 14, and that I meet criteria on every diagnostic sheet even if I fill each question based on the least a given problem has ever affected me."
