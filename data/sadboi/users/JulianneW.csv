NC Counties have 3 different tax rates, so not all are the same. A handful of counties also have a transit tax added.  Once the sales amounts are entered into the online system, on the next page, they ask for tax collected from each county (which my report gives me), but theeeennn, if there’s a transit tax, I have to divide up the tax collected into the appropriate fractions, like 2.25% tax rate to the county, .5% tax rate to transit tax, and enter those into the boxes correctly.
