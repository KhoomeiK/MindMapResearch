I've had plenty of companies change my bill when a billing discrepancy was discovered. Once again when I pay it I will be paying 30 more than I'm supposed to. I understand that will come back as a credit but it regularly takes months for credit to show up for me. Therefore I'm overpaying $30 it's not the value of the money Don't give a shit about that in the first place. The point is I used 1 gigabyte of data and was charged for 4 and like I said I've had many companies clear up a billing discrepancy without crediting me. How are you so familiar with Google Fi protocol cuz that's just what it is THERE protocol.

You only need a VPN if you want an out of country IP
