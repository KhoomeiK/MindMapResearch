unpopularopinion,fn98biy,t3_g06zev,1586763011.0,"You're no more selfish than parents are themselves. Ask any parent why they decided to have kids and their response will almost always start with ""I/we wanted..."". We're all living (or trying to live) the lives we want. Parents aren't more selfless just because what they want comes with the caretaking of a child. That person didn't even exist before they came along. They essentially manufactured someone to care for. There's nothing wrong with that if that's what they want, I'm just trying to say that you shouldn't think of your decision to not have kids as being the more selfish path because the alternative is just as much. Adoption is different though. I would grant more selfless points to adoption."

You don't know what that person would have chosen if, as an adult, they could look back and change it.

I think the pro-choice counterargument is definitely less elegant and so they try to stretch their stance into agreeable talking points like protecting women's bodily autonomy. To me, it's as simple as life not being as precious as the Christian right thinks it is. For example, we put our pets down when they are old and/or have a complicated disease but we force our own elders to live on in pain and loneliness because human life is some cherished pearl that can never be disposed of regardless of the horrible circumstances. Why is death seen as such a terrible thing? Why is it sad when a person dies? The only reason is because everyone who knew and loved that person now has to deal with the pain and grief of their loss. The person themselves are free. They're either in some afterlife place or (more likely) they just don't exist. Earth doesn't matter to them anymore. A fetus has no loved ones, isn't aware of its own existence, and would most likely have been bound for a pretty difficult life if it was born.
