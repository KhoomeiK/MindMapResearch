Alcoholism_Medication,fqcmtis,t3_ghy75g,1589262497.0,"No probs! At first I continued to drink on it, I found taking it an hour or two beforehand slowed me down a bit, then over a couple of weeks on it I made a conscious effort to drink a bit less than the previous day until I was down to one can of beer, where I stayed for a few days before cutting that out completely. I also found after a couple of weeks I no longer really craved wine, which was my drink of choice and swapped to the beer which I don't particularly like which I think helped a lot too. Stick with it, it wasn't really until 4 weeks on it I really felt it was making a difference

Edit to add: a sleep aid made a big difference for me too, as my sleep patterns were all messed up. Hope this is helpful :)"
