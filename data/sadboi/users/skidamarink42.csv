There shouldn't be a blanket statement over a couple of illnesses when so many other obviously qualify... epilepsy wasn't a disqualifier at my DMV. I'm not saying your wrong, I'm just saying it should be case by case. Those who shouldn't drive should have their licenses revoked, not everyone who might suffer from an illness but that is obviously capable of driving, like bipolar II. I do see what you're saying, though."
bipolar2,fclg99j,t1_fcl66ue,1577747082.0," Plenty of people without mental illness take Ambien, but it shouldn't be taken before a drive. Insomnia isn't on the list. Plenty of people with pain conditions also take medications that can alter their ability to drive. Pain conditions also didn't make the list. I feel it all goes towards responsible medication use. Don't drive if you're currently affected by a medication,but don't deny the right to drive to those who drive responsibly, either. It's a frustrating system."

My doctor never gave me a heads up that my diagnosis could potentially prevent me from basic things, like blood donations or drivers license renewals."

I know you don't have the time or the money of a therapist, but there are sliding scale options for the money side of things. It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to make the time for a neutral third party to help you work things out. Your mental health matters, too."

Fortunately I scheduled a therapy appointment for something else, & my therapist immediately confirmed that something was wrong with me. She had suspected a mood disorder for a while but hadn't been sure since I only scheduled appointments when I was depressed. It was a wild ride.

 (& yes, the nurse practitioner & I had a productive conversation about my diagnosis later. He is new to his craft & still has lots of learning to do. Fortunately he is willing to grow from his mistakes.)"
