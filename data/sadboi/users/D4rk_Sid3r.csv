If for example you would hook up with someone but wear a blindfold and never actually see them you would still fall in love.

depression,fcgng49,t3_egzqgq,1577642036.0,"Hey I don't know much about you but I just wanna say ""be there in the moment and realize you've saved yourself"". 

No matter how shitty you feel like keep a post it note that says ""love yourself for who you are, no matter how dark it gets don't dwell on it and move on"" stick it next to a mirror or something that you could see everyday.

This idea sounded stupid for me, even to think positive and all of that bullshit until I tried it.

I started from being nice to others and to slowly find a way for me to speak about my feelings and get comfortable with it.

I saw countless of therapist over the past 8 years and I lied to all of them except for this year, I decided I wanted to be happy and focus on myself.

I'm still going into a loop of emotions either due to my bipolar disorder and depression but I believe it is there no matter what and I have to learn to live with it.

It helped me learn about myself more than anything else, made me create things beyond my imagination. 

I made things based on my emotions and expressed myself in a way I never did before.

So believe this, you are an amazing person whether your past mistakes proves you wrong or anything like that. (I don't personally know you)

But you just deserve to treat yourself better don't let anyone affect your mood just because of something they said.

I hope you understand what I mean and I don't wanna sound like an annoyance to you but believe in yourself!!!!

PS. I hope that you read this and hope you all the best do something to distract yourself from thinking about inner feelings and keep smiling :)) have a great day!"
depression,fc2gpge,t3_efts5f,1577359262.0,"Hey don't beat yourself up man think of the things you would miss out on the good side of life you still got a bright future ahead and if you die you won't see any of that and you'll probably be bored of being dead since you wouldn't be able to do anything. 

If you wanna die so badly try and think about other people aswell man alot of people out there are struggling it's not just you. 

And I'm gonna say one word to you man don't be lying to yourself you just not thinking straight right now. 

Go out there be nice to people do something good for some stranger for no reason so you don't think too much of what's going on inside trust me. 

Dying is a waste of time you spent years growing up, you've lost people, friends, family members but it's just how life goes but you gotta stay strong for yourself it doesn't matter how much money you have!

Money ain't shit to me no more I thought being financially stable would make me feel better it didn't so don't beat yourself up and always know who's the one saving you from dying, it's gonna be YOU.

You just need to keep faith no need to stress anymore if you feel like shit just talk man, who gives a fuck of what people think about you.

I hope this will make you feel better don't turn your back on yourself look straight and don't think about problems.

PS. Message me if you wanna talk"
depression,fc02omb,t3_ef4960,1577275542.0,"In the end when you feel like shit just do something nice for someone something that's unexpected. 

It has helped me every now and then. There's times where I wanna be isolated I once did that for 6 months went off the grid stayed in my room not go out for any reason stopped eating and just stayed in my small room on my own I managed to figure things out about myself. 

Now if I feel too depressed instead of doing dumb things I think about my closest friends, that I can count on and give them a call or text.

I make sure I call someone that knows how to listen and that I can trust, cuz it's better rather than calling a suicide hotline that wouldn't seem like they truly care and that they just getting paid to get yourself out of that mind set but for me that is such a bad idea.

I have no idea what is going through my mind but I like to share things that would help others.

Anyways stay positive love you all and keep the good things going I hope you spent an amazing time with friends and family. 

Merry Christmas and love yourself"

Rn I'm at the hospital after I got knee surgery and I decided to stay for few days to help out with my depression idk my mental problem that I've had my entire life.

depression,fbcre6z,t3_eckidz,1576731440.0,"I haven't been in a real relationship mostly I fucked them up by thinking we together and it fucked me up.

I've been through some good and bad things in life but what took me awhile to realize is that I was depressed for a very long time I think it's fucked up but I'm thinking ever since of the age of 8-9 years old. Recently I've been thinking I might be bipolar. Anyways I was kinda going off topic but my greatest advice for you is start reflecting on yourself and if you do drugs or drink alcohol try cut down on it (if you have an addiction) and I've started going all out on working out on my own trying to become fit because it distracts yourself from the awful things that has happened, keep doing what you love the most. Set goals in your life. I wanted to change as a person and decided to always be nice no matter what I wanna be someone who supports everyone in every single way but right now I'm trying to be ""selfish"" to try and beat this bipolar or just depression that I've been keeping with me sorry for the long post but I am willing to help everyone for whatever reason I want people to be happy instead of vanishing into a dark state of mind"
