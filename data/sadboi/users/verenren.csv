i have a voice too. its not an angel, it constantly mocks me and makes me doubt myself and makes little mistakes seem as bad as murder. my therapist said that that's not soo common but it definitely isnt a sign of going insane. since i dont know how to help you get rid of these voices.. maybe you can give more power to the angel voice by writing down what it says. maybe you will believe those words more if they're written. as for the bad voice.. i know you hear it, try to not listen to it and dont give it much thought. i know that because they're in your head it makes coping with it a million times harder but you got to keep on going. and ofc if not, find professional help. it helps.
