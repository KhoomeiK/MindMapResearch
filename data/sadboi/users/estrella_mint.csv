survivorsofabuse,f94pqdc,t3_e3hnjh,1575097440.0,"Deffo don't listen to your mum, the idea of accepting someone's ""bad qualities"" is like a survival method of surviving abuse (usually a result of gaslighting). If someone's bad qualities are as extreme as abuse, even if its emotional and not physical that person does not respect you and they are dangerous. 

Everyone gets angry, but its not normal to slap someone out of anger, its illegal. 

It took me for my dad to attack me for me to finally accept that he's abusive and dangerous, bc I was thinking about his good sides and I empathised with him because I know he's had trauma. You have to respect yourself more than that, trust me the mindset of excusing it isn't good. I ended up in an abusive relationship because I ignored red flags thanks to my dad normalising abuse in my household.

This is actually the first time I'm speaking about it, but about a month ago I was convinced I theoretically figured out how to time travel. I got really excited and wrote paragraphs upon paragraphs on how to do this. 

My theory was triggered by a video I watched about astral projection, the ideas were based on astral projection and non-linear time. But honestly there's no evidence of time travel via astral projection other than dreaming of different time periods. And if time travel was possible this way I'm sure another astral projector would have figured it out by now.

Writing a letter might be better to avoid arguments and acknowledge the positive loving behaviour he is displaying now. That seems like a scary thing to do but it may be very freeing and allow you to have a wonderful relationship with your dad moving forward.

Also be careful, abusers will often display caring behaviour with the sole intent to manipulate their victim/s into doubting whether the abuse was/is real. My dad does this, and there have been times where he showed glimpses of remorse and then just continues the abuse.

I have now decided that an abuser is not worth forgiving and not worthy of my love or time if they don't admit to their wrongs and genuinely feel sorry for it."
