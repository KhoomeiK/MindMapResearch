6/9 calorie counting - no real reason why, just didn’t end up doing it today. 

really looking forward to being back at school, just for the routine. i got offered an interview for an internship today, which is actually exciting! I applied to like 10 and they were only the second to get back to me in any fashion. itll be monday or tuesday. i guess i need to do some preparation now!!

hoping that you all had great days."

totally agree on social media. i gave up twitter, instagram and facebook for a few days a couple of weeks ago and it felt really good. i feel like i “need” facebook&insta for extracurricular school things, like promoting meetings on my story, but when I dont *have* to use it, its nice to forget about it for a while. 

tiktoc is just a time suck, and twitter doesn’t serve me any purpose but to make me nervous about the world. im hoping this is goodbye for real to that app!!"

8/8 meditation (will right before bed)

6/8 calorie counting - i actually half counted for today, but i gave up halfway through. im pretty sure i was at a deficit, but i cant be sure.

5hrs 44 mins on my phone today.

I deleted twitter and tiktoc today (showing my age, much?) which makes me feel better. twitter can be such a negative place, and i dont have to be there. a lot of my day was spent re-setting up my kindle from like 2013 or so so i could read books from overdrive/libby on there, rather than my phone. it had music on there from about 8th grade, which was VERY funny to look at. overall a productive day, Id say. Tomorrow is packing so I can spend Friday with my sister before I go back to school."

one more thing to tack on to this: screen time, according to my phone. I just want to be more aware, I guess. I did the ""break up with your phone"" thing over a week ago and while it worked, it wasn't to the extent that I would like (but that's on me, not the challenge!) it's also partially publically shaming myself for how much time I do spend on my phone.

More importantly, this is my first time reading a book, of any kind, in literal years. Yes, even for school (SparkNotes has been a curse to me). I *loved* reading as a kid but dropped off once I entered high school. I still would read books, but not nearly as many. I'm a sophomore in college now and I'm ready to rediscover my love of reading! I'm planning on reading 26 books this year, which may be a stretch, but I think I need the challenge to motivate me. The first book of 2020 is the audiobook of *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari. I have a couple more audiobooks that I'm excited about after that, and then I'll get into reading physical books. School and the internet take up most of my waking hours, but I now have a goal to reach. Looking forward to this challenge!!!"

Ive been sticking to some of these pretty consistently for the last couple of weeks home from college, but Ill need the motivation to maintain the calorie/tracking goal, as thats just honestly the most labor intensive for me

Work out 3x/week - i have 3 days of no classes during the week, i want to fill them with something more than just schoolwork! 

meditate daily - it’s something that ive done off and on, but i think its one of those things that i really should be doing frequently to get the most out of it

journal every day - again it’s something ive been doing these last few weeks and enjoying, and i got a nice journal for christmas, so why stop?

count calories every day - i wont be setting a weight goal, but this should do me some good in that department. starting at 170ish.

the last thing that i really want to do this year, not just this month, is to read books. my goal is one every other week for a total of 26. meaning that by this time on the 14th, i should be done listening to the audiobook for sapiens!

looking forward to spending this next month with you all!!"

i read the forward and intro to Alyssa Mastromonico’s book “Who thought this was a good idea?”. it was pretty short, but maybe a chapter or two a night will be manageable.

Ok so I definitely need to go back to some of the basics I accomplished in September. October was actually better than Sept scale-wise but I need some more of what I did then to get back in a little bit of a routine. ill be keeping some goals as well, though. 

1. Tracking and staying within 1200/1300 calories. Ive been lacking on the tracking (hey that rhymes!) but guesswork hasn’t done me too dirty weight wise. Exception for Thursday/Friday of Thanksgiving.

2. Designated food categories to get at least one of every day: fruit, veggie, protein.

3. Limit coffees, ALL coffees, to 3 a week. x/12

4. An exercise goal! Pick one: yoga or 8,000+ steps. I should do yoga more, as I did buy a full semester pass and didnt use it at all last month. 

5. Again I’ll track my posting. 

6. A (reusable) bottle of water a day! Even if its just chugging it before bedtime!

7. Lastly, weight! I want to weight in 3x/week. My lowest weigh in this month was 166, so Ill make the goal 162. 2lbs/week is too ambitious for me at this point."

calories under 1300: 1/31. 1215 today!

fruit: 2/31 just ate a banana

post!: 2/31 hell yeah

nightly routine 1.5/31 i just brushed my teeth and journaled, no face wash. 

coffee 1/13 did I say I had one yesterday? I had one yesterday 


I’m glad I got that fruit in, bc the rest of my calories were trash today. I didn’t get my steps but boy did I exercise, lol. Stressful class that lasted two and a half hours plus silly drama got my heart rate right up there. 
Therapy tomorrow, yay! I haven’t been thinking about it which is probably a good thing? Like I havent felt the need for it as much? Which is good. Any I go home 8 days from now!!! Its been over a month since Ive been home, so a little break will be nice.

I want to be between 162-165 by the end of the month.

Gonna reduce my calorie goal, so when I go over my cal goal, it's not as bad as when I do it now. Goal: under 1300 25/31 days.

Gonna take some inspiration from u/perddupoids and say a piece of fruit every day!! I've been focusing on keeping under calories, but not ensuring that those calories are *healthy* calories. My nutrition is way off, this will be a little step in the right direction. Goal: 31/31

Gonna take 7,000 steps and/or do yoga 5days/week. Goal: 23/31

Post on here everyday!!! Goal: 31/31

Wash my face, brush my teeth and journal nightly. Goal: 31/31

Oh, and some other inspiration, limiting coffee drinks!! I do it way more often than I should. So let's say 3 a week, making for x/13.

I think that's gonna have to be it. There's so much more that I *want* to do right now, but building healthy habits takes time. Can't wait to see how it all goes!!"

I’m also gonna drop the whole academic goal thing. There’s not enough specificity i can get when everything varies so much.

Dog walk! Again! And the owner asked me to do an hour instead of a half hour, and gave me $20 just for doing that :D good times.

Pretty ok day academically. Studied for another test tomorrow, plus I pulled out the planner and my syllabi and broke down everything for the next month, which felt good. It may be easier than this month? At least I dont have any tests until November!!!!

ok i posted this and i realized immediately it sounds like some weird inspo crap so lets talk about actually what to do.

spend a little bit of time out in the open, just sitting, not necessarily interacting, just kinda being there is ok. coffee shops are great for this. this is the first in a series of baby steps to socializing (with floormates) again, if you so choose. 

in the morning a little routine is nice (wash ya face, brush your teeth, eat an apple, take ur meds, whatever)

try your best to continue to go to class. its SO hard, i know, but you’re setting your depressed self up for success.

again, in a hypomanic/manic state its so hard to sleep (for me at least)  so try and get some sleep every night."

bipolar,evsz84y,t3_cl2act,1564759417.0,"First of all, please go to your doctor. It really does sound like (hypo)mania, and if it is you should should treat it seriously. The right medication hopefully won’t have you crashing into a depression. 

The very first thing that my psychiatrist did when I had my first manic episode was to take me of zoloft. quite a few (if not the vast majority) of psychiatrists will not prescribe an antidepressant to anyone with bipolar because its so likely to trigger a manic episode. 

I got my diagnosis 6 weeks ago. I also though that I was just depressed and anxious. Somethings that my doctor recommended that I do was look at the last year of my life and put a general “theme” to each month. I literally looked at my finsta and talked with my mom to get an accurate idea of what was going on. what I found was that every 3-4 months I was having a depressive (or possibly mixed) episode, with some sort of hypomania in between. Going on medication like a mood stabilizer and an antipsychotic should help calm those episodes, if your doctor diagnoses you with bipolar (which none of us can do, none of us are your doctor, but we can all talk from lived experience.) 

I guess my main points are that you should go to your doctor even if it’s scary, you dont wants things to get worse; a diagnosis is scary, but its not the end of your life and it can even help with your depression. I know that you can make it through the next semester, even with something like this going on. best of luck, OP."

BipolarReddit,euqtbe9,t3_ch67d2,1563984970.0,"the first time i ever had a manic/hypomanic/mixed episode (which was a month ago, mind you) i was so confused as to why i didnt feel good? everything i knew about bipolar was that mania=feel good and depression=feel bad (i have experienced a bunch of that already lmao) 

i was SO irritable, sleeping like 2 hours a night, crying whenever anything bothered me, and yet was still shocked when i went to my psych and she told me that it was a manifestation of bipolar, and not just a weird depressive episode. i still am getting meds figured out, but looking back at it holy shit it was bad.

anyways i guess the point is that even as someone who experienced depression and would like to think they are pretty in the know about mental health, i was SHOCKED that a manic episode wasn’t all good feels all the time.
