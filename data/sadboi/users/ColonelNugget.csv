TheStrokes,fqxhy2v,t3_gjvf2o,1589732564.0,"I mean this might sound a tad douchey, but I just think the Strokes aren‚Äôt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù enough to make a substantial mainstream impact. When the Strokes make music, they don‚Äôt make it to get hits, or sell tracks. They don‚Äôt make their albums to become mainstream, it just doesn‚Äôt seem like they desire it.

As much as I love AM, Alex Turner said before it was intentionally made in some ways to be more approachable and ‚Äònormie‚Äô. AM has it‚Äôs place in the Monkeys discography, but you have to admit it is substantially more *simple* than TBHC, Whatever People Say, FWN, and even Humbug and SIAS. AM has a very loud, punchy, almost hip-hopish sound, with lyrics that aren‚Äôt deep at all. It kinda seemed like a cheap shot to old Arctic Monkeys fans, because they were used to the lyrical genius and complexity of past albums, and AM then has lyrics and riffs that are a lot less deep. I love AM but a lot of my hardcore Monkeys fans/friends think the album is their ‚Äúsell-out album‚Äù. The Strokes don‚Äôt want to sellout. It is like, the antithesis of the Strokes lol. 

To sum up, I think the Strokes never made it mainstream because they never felt a calling to make a mass-appealing album. They kinda just make what they make and if its a hit its a hit. Which is respectable IMO."
