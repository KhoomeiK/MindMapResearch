It honestly sucks"
depression,ezxgqa4,t3_d2pnl8,1568240057.0,"Hi, i dont really know what to write, infact this is my very first post since joining reddit. I feel the exact same way you do. It sucks, i see people i used to be really close to become distant with me because of how different i am, they have no idea how to approach or talk to me anymore. I try my hardest to try and put a smile on everyday so people wont think somethings wrong but for the past like 3 months or so now i just feel lost with my own mind and i jusy feel angry, at myself and everything around me because i cant understand what happened just one day things changed and i just feel like i lost my personality, in a way i kind of dont understand life at the moment. Im 19 and in my final year of college and before things changed it was really important for me to study and to work hard and try my best but now its like background noise and i focus more on pretty colours, flowers and scenery and drown all the horrible noise in my life out with music and sleep. Im sorry im rambling on im just so kind of (within respect) glad im not the only person feeling this way, i think what happens well what i believe has happened in my case and could possibly be your case too is disassociating yourself from life because maybe something happened, it could of been years ago or yesturday but i believe it catches up to you and the only way your brain can deal with it is to just stop.
Sorry i probably have no idea what im talking about, i just wanted you to know you are not alone. If i could i would try and offer you advice but because i feel the same way i dont even know what the advice could be myself. I guess i just needed to out how i felt because i csnt particularly talk to people about in my life."
