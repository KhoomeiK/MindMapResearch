Concerta,fpeunux,t3_gd1er9,1588555310.0,"I‚Äôll be honest, I do it regularly. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone who likes their concerta to work, it‚Äôs not so bad when your coming down from it though."
Concerta,fnwroap,t3_g4a7vx,1587324113.0,"27 x 2 seems like a good amount, I personally take one 36mg and it wears off by 5pm or so. Probably will be switching to a longer lasting med called Foques"
Psychosis,fhxezug,t3_f57wlp,1581952821.0,"Currently been an Early Intervention program for 2 years now. Honestly, you have nothing to worry about. It is scary at first but that‚Äôs just the illness, now when I go it feels like routine part of my life."

Psychosis,ffi2ywb,t3_etnxl2,1579963561.0,"So funny, right before this I had a memory from my psychosis when the paramedics made me sign some waver form and not specifically telling me what it is. I swear I sold my soul that day, but hey, don‚Äôt even worry about it üòé"

Concerta,fesqdg5,t1_fesohpw,1579367924.0,"I haven‚Äôt thought about it, I don‚Äôt really implement milk into my diet other then a tad with my tea in the morning. 

Thanks for the input though, my meeting is next Tuesday I‚Äôll bring up everything, I‚Äôve heard Vyvanse isn‚Äôt so bad which was the first medication I was originally going to be put on."

Concerta,fekgzm0,t3_eplfcp,1579199848.0,"I switched to tea once I started taking concerta, honestly I find the concerta wakes me up already and I just like having the hot drink in the morning. Coffee seems to make my head kind of hurt and I feel to ‚Äúbuzzy‚Äù I guess."

Psychosis,fdgptkp,t3_el1u6j,1578405128.0,"I had the exact same thing happen in my head two years ago, turns out it was psychosis.. but the delusions never just go away they take a while to actually work through and realize it‚Äôs not real. Also I read this book ‚Äúthe disappearance of the universe‚Äù at the time which really fucked with my head, but it mentions this. If god is love (which we all eventually come to realize) then we are love, and this is what Jesus was trying to teach. Since god is love, he wants nothing but the best for you. The only hell that exists is the reality we live in now, Heaven is not outside of us but inside, truly."
Psychosis,fc18e87,t3_efgqbt,1577311192.0,"Friend, I‚Äôm so sorry this is happening to you. I hope you‚Äôve gotten some rest by now, everything will be okay eventually. It‚Äôs important to recognize that these are delusions and not real, and to practice mindfulness in dire episodes like this. Focus on deep breathing, the blanket on your body, fabric on your finger tips, I believe the goal is to slow down your thoughts."
