I'm not sure if you'll get a notification for my post or not. But I hope you will.

First I would like to thank you all, to anyone who read my post and who gave me some of your time to post here and share.
Thank you a lot. I can't thank you all enough. 

I have a little update and I thought I share with you all, I shared the negative and now I would like to share some positivity. 

I mentioned that I'll try Melatonin, and I did. Since I received it and tried it I start having some sleep without panicking or nightmares. 
Which is great.    

Thats all I have. 
I hope you are all are doing fine. and I hope you are having a great day/night/weeks and months.

Take care everyone.
And again, Thank you."
depression,etvaef4,t1_etuyjgg,1563230285.0,"Thank you for sharing your story.
I'm deeply sorry about your family.
I can't imagine how you feel at all. 
I'm glad you have your husband by your side.
Having someone who understands what you go throw do help a lot. 

I tried the video games but honestly I'm too old for this. It was too much for me. But I do watch youtube between time to time. I like documentaries and the background voices do help a lot throw the day. 

I really hope things will get better for everyone. 
Everyone shared a little bit and I feel sad and bad that I let some of you bring up their feeling and memories.

I'm sorry so sorry if i made you upset and anyone who read the post."
depression,etubuto,t1_etubpvn,1563209043.0,"I'll try it for sure now.
Thank you so much. :"")"
depression,etu8qoi,t1_etu6hkk,1563206972.0,"I'm speechless ..

I don't how to say it enough or how to show it but all I can say is thank you over and over.
Thank you"
depression,etu74gp,t1_etu5agx,1563205872.0,"Panic attacks while sleeping...I have a lot of breakdowns and rarely panic attackes but when i do its not while I'm sleep :( honestly with the feeling they make you feel dying is the best solution at that moment. 

I'm glad you mentioned meditation. I'm trying to read more about it and try it one day. 
Did it help in general not just the sleeping? if it did then how? I really want to try it i figured it may lead me to a little of peace.

I never thought of waking up honestly. 
I go throw it crying my self out till i sleep hours later without knowing to then waking up to my alarm, But I like the idea maybe I'll keep a list of the movies I like to just play them out once it happen. 

I saw some people having the same thing that happen to you, Melatonin actually gave them night mare or even wakes them up at night too, I hope it will help me. now since the situation with my sleeping I start drink some tea, but it's not that powerful. 

Thank you so much. 
I will try the TV idea I liked it alot, I force myself to watch it and keep my mind away from thinking. and the meditation I feel like now i do have more reasons to try it 
Thank you again and I hope your having a great day~~"
depression,etu3s8k,t1_etu301o,1563203535.0,"They aren't on Amazon US :( 
But I'll compare in the labels and I'm sure I'll find a similar brand.

Thank you~~"
depression,etu34pf,t1_etu2f29,1563203074.0,"Thank you.
Your words really made me cry.
They really mean alot and just by hearing me out also means alot to me. 
Thank you. really.

It's not dumb at this point I'll try to do any thing even a simple things. 
As you said, anything is better than reapeating the same thing.. 

Thank you so much *sending you a hug wherever you are* Thank you"
depression,etu2qqm,t1_etu20zg,1563202799.0,"I tried to find it online. mostly (if not all I found) are magnesium oxide. 
Thank you for pointing this one out I'll search more for magnesium glycinate or citrate.

Thank you~"
depression,etu1lxz,t1_etu0f86,1563201991.0,"I don't but recently i saw people talking about how Melatonin helped with their sleeping and I just ordered it.

Never heard of ZMA before. But I heard about the magnesium before.
Don't sound bad. I read about it more and maybe give it a try.

Thank you so much~
And thank you for the suggestion I'll for sure search more about it."
depression,etu1c85,t1_etu02a2,1563201796.0,"Thank you, to you and everyone who messaged me, thank you.
The fact that you gave me a time in your day and heard me helps a lot. 

Beside my family, hope is all I have.
On my okay days I feel like yes there is hope
but then it goes away....

It is bad people have to feel this way. and it makes me feel guilty feeling this way when there is people are in worse place than me.
Why people have to feel this feelings, i don't know. 


I finish work around 6pm and by 9pm i'm in my bed. all i do is nothing just overthinking taking a shower then try to sleep thats it.. and weekends become the worst time in my week.
I got to the point where I'm trying to find a part-time job so i can escape my thinking.."
depression,ettxznm,t1_ettugbl,1563199273.0,"I'm. and they are the only reason I'm still trying. 
They tried their best (still trying) and offered even paying for going to therapy. Which I did because I deeply want to fix everything to just feel normal again.
I went to 3 different clinics and I it never helped. and I had to stop, in some way they made me feel worse. 

Seeing the pain in my family eyes while they try and nothing works and seeing them feeling hopeless trying to help me, I couldn't do it anymore.
So I start acting and pretending that I'm fine and I'm doing well....when really I'm going down the hill so fast. 

Dreams are the worst, its all about the worries and sadness you have. like you can escape them at all.
They are there in real life, and they visits you in your dreams.

I stopped talking to anymore near me..Because from my experience talking never changes a thing. 
I'm giving up but not giving up yet, doesn't make sense right? what I meant is I'm still trying my best to find peace in my life, and I hope I will. 
I know alot of people go throw the same thing I go throw and maybe even worse and sometimes I feel bad for having this feeling of depression and sadness but I can't help it. 
I hope everyone will get to that place where we feel peace and just normal and just live day by day. 

I find writing to people who don't know me much easier in times where I can't hold it anymore in my heart, so thank you for reading my post, and I'm deeply sorry if it made you in any way unhappy or upset."
depression,ettdrzk,t3_cd6d58,1563174830.0,"Yes.
After an okay day, I'll suddenly start feeling like ""no you are kidding yourself it's not going to be okay it never been okay"".
That feeling start attacking me even in my deep sleep, I'll wake up freaking out and crying."
