Filmmakers,fdoxda4,t3_emigm2,1578615042.0,"Not sure where to begin! This film is very personal to me because it is inspired by my life. I wrote it, produced it, and acted in it while my best friend Stacey Maltin directed and edited. JONES was made on a shoe string budget with a 90 % femxle identifying crew, via Besties Make Movies, a content studio founded by myself and Stacey. Nearly everything that could go wrong during the shoot did and if she and I hadn't worked together on a number of projects before, I'm confident the whole thing would have fallen apart. Unexpected rain storms, none functioning equipment, broken elevators, & not being able to pay people resulted in going wayyyy off schedule and changing everything on the fly.

JONES is still doing the festival circuit and has won Best Drama Short at Twister Alley Int. FF (on MovieMaker Mag's 50 fests worth the entry fee) and has received several Best Actress, Best Director and Best Picture Editing nominations. 

If anyone has any questions about making personal films, running a green set, wearing multiple hats on a project, submitting to festivals or otherwise, I'm happy to discuss!"

alcoholic,eo9x6k4,t3_bpkth3,1558402349.0,You got this! In addition to AA it might help if you keep yourself super busy with other things. Do all the things you've been putting off and reach out to friends to see if you can help them with anything :)
alcoholic,eo9wx8t,t3_bqpxx8,1558402173.0,I think it might help! Everyone is different. If you're in a social situation and feeling like you want something to drink or even if you're home and drinking non alcoholic beer would stop you from drinking it seems like a positive thing.
