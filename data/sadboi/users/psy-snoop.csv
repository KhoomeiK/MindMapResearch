SuicideWatch,fr0a8oy,t1_fqy4n2b,1589788644.0,"You just made my day a great bit better! Do you think you might be able to talk to your psychiatrist about how you really feel? He/ She wants to help you and i think there is nothing to be ashamed for. Furthermore psychiatrists see and talk to a looot of people with heavy mental problems, i do not think that they will make fun of you or whatsoever.

Yeah, whatever, i wish you all the best <3"
SuicideWatch,fqxbcr8,t3_gley16,1589729371.0,"Hey i am sorry that I didn’t come here for the last few hours, frankly it is because I am going through some shit time too at the moment. 
But listen: I don’t know you and your situation. I can’t imagine the pain you are going through right now because only you can. I wish I could help you to improve your situation, but I can’t, cuz only you are in the position to do that. One question i sometimes ask my self when I struggle with suicidal thoughts is if I really want to die or if i want to be happy? I, for my self, want to be happy. That’s super hard, but it is possible. I believe in that. The most important thing and the first big step on that way imo is acceptance. Accepting the situation that your in, accepting your inner jail. You can only fight what you are seeing. You already did that by writing this post and sharing your sadness with me. This is not an easy step. It needs courage. I am sure that you are a tough person. You already proved it to me. Courage is what is needed to change things - I believe in you that you are able to change things. Once again: only you can improve your situation. 

Maybe you would like to check out r/spirituality or r/meditation. There are a lot of posts of people that were in a similar situation as you, who write about their way and journey out of that messy shit piece of life."
SuicideWatch,fqwz9id,t3_gley16,1589721901.0,So you feel like you‘re misunderstood by your family and people who pretend that they want to help you; you feel lonely when there actually are lots of people around you - is that right?
SuicideWatch,fqwxmak,t3_gley16,1589720640.0,"Hey friend, would you like to share a bit more of your situation with us?"
1P_LSD,fqpugb0,t3_gk855z,1589554188.0,I think 100 is a good dose. I‘ve taken 1p and 1cp several times and never took more than 150
schizophrenia,fqm2rbu,t1_fqjixjr,1589470504.0,"I think the human mind is far too complex to be reduced to be a playground for Chemists and Pharmacists. I am sure that meds help people - no doubt - but i hope for me it won´t be necessary cuz i am not that far on my symptoms, so maybe we can find out the reason for why my mind wants to escape reality without sedating it (e.g by an psychological therapy)"
schizophrenia,fqm24am,t1_fqkndsx,1589470184.0,Thank you for your elaborations!
schizophrenia,fqm1yyz,t1_fqj9iwz,1589470111.0,"Thats the reason why i don´t want to take pills tbh. I think of my mind not as a chemistry set someone can play around with until it is ""okay"". Maybe i should overthink my stolid no ""matter what"" rejection of any medical treatment though.

Thank you for sharing your experiences."

Journaling,fqhcd78,t1_fqg4twx,1589373880.0,"I think many people do not actually have a plan what to do with their finished journals. I guess for me it’s more like a reminder or anchor that can help one to come through challenging experiences and phases in your life because you documented a lot of those phases in those diaries, which phases and bad times have all gone by."

TripSit,foajpcz,t3_g6m4zw,1587647782.0,"Have you taken Acid before? If it is your first time i would highly recomnend to do none of both. I personally have no experience with a candy flip, but i can tell you for sure that smoking weed on LSD can get really unpleasent really fast. If you decide to smoke some weed though, wait until you come down. Candyflip should be a nice thing to do i guess, but if it is your first time. or if you are unexperienced, i would highly suggest you to start things slowly.

Cheers M8, enjoy your time"

1P_LSD,fn1ijaf,t1_fn080bo,1586562744.0,"It was my first time doin somethin‘ in the area of 50mics and i can definitely feel what you are saying, man. Nevertheless I really liked the experience; I would even say this is the best dosage I‘ve ever had until now. This amount of acid doesn’t force you to let go no matter If you want or not and if not it will result in fear and a terrifying bad trip. It is more like a gently opener to your heart and feelings. You can open the door and look what’s going on inside if you want (and you can loook fucking deep even with lower doses if you want and if you decide to open this fucking door ) but you can also just kinda ignore it - when this was the case during the comeup today I felt the exact same way that you described it. But once I put my first step into this new room, behind this magic door, it turned out to be a very smooth and kinda heavy weight, yet extremely charming and beautiful experience. 
Sending all my love out there, fellas <33"

TripSit,flwq2is,t1_flwpku2,1585560559.0,"I am working in a social institution. I guess you would describe the service we offer as ""assisted living"" for people who suffer from mental illness. So we go shopping for or with the clients or drive them to the doctor for example - we help them with anything they need support. Today theres is not much for me to do so i hang just out in the office, doing stuff (reading, drawing, Reddit and shitting like 3 times while i am here).

If your mood will continue decreasing try not to fight it. Whatever will be, will be and it will go over. U listening to some nice music?"
