In America you get jailed for murdering trans & gay people. In other places it might be illegal to be trans. Just like it used to be illegal to be gay. People are killed still for being gay as well in other countries without any justice. 

Basically, there's just more acceptance (the bar is pretty low still) in the US and accessibility, and there's some justice.

Also in other cultures it's not as accepted, like being gay isn't accepted.

See what I mean? Wouldn't say it's all a bandwagon but much like the explosion of gays coming to light in recent decades, it's just more accepted and safer to be visible.

There actually are ways for people with borderline to see if their emotions are fitting or not by doing something taught in DBT called ""Checking The Facts"" as well as ""STOP"" and these help us take a second and slow things down and see if our emotions or actions are fitting for the situation or not, and helps us be more aware of if we are reacting to a narrative we created or objectively what is actually happening. A big part of DBT is mindfulness as well to help us recognize when our emotions start to rise and recognize our thoughts (or cognitive distortions) that we need to challenge that basically make that narrative that can cause us to REACT when triggered as opposed to coping with emotions in a healthy way. There's also a skill set called interpersonal effectiveness where you learn how to interact with people in a way that ultimately achieves your goals without pushing people away, hurting them or trying to control them. The goal of DBT is to be like your own therapist and self regulate. 

It's really hard in the situation of living with someone coping with borderline probably because you want to help them realize these things, but if they aren't at a point where they have asked for someone to point those things out, it would be like throwing water on a grease fire a lot of the time, because that person probably just doesn't have the skills necessary, especially when in the fight or flight throes of an episode, to get out of their ""emotion mind"" and think rationally and logically and see what you are trying to do. That's just the nature of the disorder when untreated or early in recovery. When the person is calm it's possible to talk about behavior and boundaries and what's acceptable, while still recognizing they're struggling. It's important to remind them that they aren't their actions, that there's no such thing as a good or bad person but that everyone is grey and messes up sometimes. But that we have to try to reduce harm and allow space for everyone to feel safe and heard, including the pwBPD. That there's a better way to get through conflict. 

It's best to try to just deescalate by maybe asking them to explain what they are experiencing and feeling and validating their core emotion (you don't have to agree to validate) and talking to them about wanting to help them in finding better ways to communicate, cope and offering help to find dbt programs if they're suffering. Then that leads to them learning skills to manage it on their own so you don't have to feel like you need to help them regulate themselves. I understand that the deescalating can be very hard especially when the pwBPD is reacting and unregulated and doing hurtful things. However, the goal in that moment is really just to bring them out of the irrational state into a rational one so you can talk to the person again, not their self protection systems and emotions. It can go from 100 mph to 15 mph pretty quickly if this method is used. It takes a lot of recognizing the person is ill and isn't skillful to help yourself want to deescalate. I know it might feel unfair but at least BPD is a good prognosis diagnosis and if that person gets treated symptoms reduce greatly even within the first year. So it won't be that way forever. They will also learn to validate your experience. 

If you or the person is curious there's tons of free DBT resources online including the entire workbook that's used to teach it. So you guys can familiarize yourselves.

My therapist works hard with me to not over identify with bpd. I'm not ""borderline"", I'm a person coping with borderline. I'm a person with borderline in recovery. But, when people say ""what, are you in an episode right now?"" If I disagree with them (not even yelling or using sharp language) or ""are you in one of /those moods/?"" As if I am different and don't go through a spectrum of emotions like a normal person (I have certain moods that need to be avoided apparently) it's hard to not internalize it and think ""they're right, I'm a borderline and need to hide this""

Everyone, nonpwBPD included, can and do experience emotional dysregulation from time to time, or even very frequently. We are allowed to experience negative emotions, and not be perfect and happy all the time during recovery because we are human beings!

In my family, if I get irritable during quarantine, they act like it's a huge deal, despite themselves showing irritability and even arguing with people, or spouting off about politics. Yet if I'm just gloomy or irritable the focus is all on me. It feels like I can't be human.

As of right now I'd try to do a full dbt program, where it's going to help you navigate this and get skills to navigate the future and can help you cope now. 

It's uncomfortable, but you need to work on understanding and forgiving yourself and self compassion even if you really don't feel like it. Everyone fucks up. We lose good things sometimes. Mourn it. Even though it was nice it evidently wasn't allowing you to grow and your symptoms and cognitive distortions were getting worse. It's time to focus on real recovery because you need more help than what you're getting in order to recover. 

If your symptoms are that bad and you're feeling that insecure it's not a good time to be in a relationship anyway and that's also something you need to accept. It's time to focus on yourself and not your FP and not relationships. This is done by noticing when you have thoughts about your FP and noticing them and letting them pass instead of expanding on them. At least for right now, so you're not obsessing and dwelling and ruminating. You can process it more slowly over time. 

Just know OP we have totally been there. I have been there and ruined good things and I accepted that it's not because I'm a terrible person but I was in the throes of my mental illness and wasn't skillful. To lose and hit rock bottom is to learn that something has to be done, it's not a sign you are awful and did awful things and deserve to be punished and alone. I have embarrassed the shit out of myself, ruined great friendships and lost many people during my hardest times. But it's not because I'm evil, I was struggling. And with an intensive program I learned about what my feelings meant and how behaviors could be abusive, and how being abusive doesn't mean you're a bad person but it does mean that you will lose and hurt people.

Haircare,fn5xy4d,t3_fzqo7h,1586679888.0,"I think that as we age and hormones change, so does our hair. I had LONG like down to my butt beautiful red chick from Brave hair, and then when I was 22, 23, I got really sick with an infection and took a new medication and attributed my hair changes to that. I lost a lot of volume, it was more brittle, lost sheen, wouldn't grow very fast. It even changed to more of a brown than a strawberry blonde. 

I'm 26 now and it's doing better, I have baby hairs coming in and I'm growing out my straight perm pretty quickly. My hair density is definitely thicker than it was. My roots aren't painful. 

I think after hormones change, it's best to just protect the hair (minimizing uses of sulfates, maybe using soft scrunchies and silky pillowcases, avoiding heat, using leave in conditioners and things like coconut oil to give it some help) and honestly taking supplements like biotin, and eating a really varied whole foods diet if you can. When I ate mostly raw vegan I was glowing, skin, hair, eyes, nails, skin. That was in my experience though. 

So, keep trying and trucking! Don't give up! Maybe see a dermatologist if things get really scary or get your hormones checked. It can't hurt to talk to a doctor about it and get recommendations from your primary care physician. Have any hairdressers talked to you about it as well?"

But also, are you assuming these things bother him or did he explicitly tell you this? Because sometimes we can get carried away with our imagination and think things are going wrong when they're really not. He could be fine. 

Have a genuine talk with him and explain the anxiety, set alarms or reminders on your phone to message him. Think positive thoughts about him and think about things you like about him. Think about how you'd like him to feel and ways to help him feel it.

You also need to learn to tolerate discomfort. It never ever will kill you. And if you keep avoiding things it is not gonna protect you, or make you more comfortable long term. You will be comfortable short term and feel terrible every time people get close to you until you break the habit. 

Feel nervous and scared and like you're gonna die if you text him first or do a loving gesture? Say to yourself ""fuck yeah it's gonna be uncomfortable but I'm going to do it anyway, and feel that discomfort and let it pass. And each time it happens I'll get less and less uncomfortable. And I'll still be safe, okay and alive. And I'll feel more attached to the people around me and they will feel love and I will feel love the more my walls come down.""

And just keep forcing yourself through the uncomfortable feelings. Let them happen. Give yourself permission to be vulnerable and uncomfortable for long term comfort instead of short term comfort.

You need to accept it's over. Breakups happen for a reason. Breakups happen because two people don't work well together and one or both are unhappy. You can't keep forcing it and hoping it works. It won't. You both deserve to be happy and with people who make you BOTH happy. Think of her needs and wants as well.  If she wanted to be with you and it made her happy, she would be doing that. And it doesn't make her a bad or cruel person for not wanting to be with you or wanting to fall in love. Sometimes we just cant, I'm sure you'll be in her position not long from now. If you ""love something let it go"" don't keep it caged up and try to force it to love you. That's not fair and cruel. 


 You need to respect yourself and not grovel, also you need to respect her new relationship regardless of what YOU want or wish was reality. You need to accept reality and realize there's lots of people in the world, and 99.9% of people don't end up with their first heartbreak.

This is a life lesson. Keep trucking. If you have to, say sorry you can't be friends anymore because you need to move on and hope she understands and to ignore the flower gesture because you have never been through a breakup before and short circuited. Then block her, delete pics of her, stop following her or checking her social media, and get detached. 

This idea of her being the one is really just a bond you formed, but it really doesn't mean she's the one. It just means you're attached to her.

I would forgive a nervous person if I were in their place. I need to trust myself and them""

This is just being human and not even just an anxious attachment thing. When most people really like someone they have thoughts like these. 


Give yourself permission to do the wrong thing sometimes and not be liked by everyone, even people you like. 

Be yourself, be where you're at in your journey with anxiety and attachment, and if people can't be empathetic or accepting or patient with you, or are super judgemental anyway, who needs em! 

Take time to just notice your thoughts, and let them go and pass by and don't feed them or the what ifs. See if you're tense in your muscles and try to release them. Try to sit in a more open posture instead of small and closed. Think things like ""I belong, these feelings are normal, they're probably nervous too, I'm trying my best""

Chemical treatments and heat tools aren't the only way hair is damaged. Regular shampooing (for some people), hot showers, brushing with hard bristles when your hair is fine, using hair ties on fine hair, removing natural oils too frequently, can all cause damage. 

It looks like your hair is fine (meaning the hair itself is thinner, but it can still look and feel thick and have a lot of volume)

Frizz like that isn't normal it's a sign of damage :s

Even if you don't like conditioner, try using a natural hair conditoner like shea moisture or something cheap and not like the main brands like Suave or anything, big brands usually aren't good for your hair (go for stuff w/o sulfates) and it should be much much healthier than being fried like that.

Maybe validate his feelings without criticizing or being judgemental of yourself 

Like you can see he's frustrated, and take that feeling and his needs seriously and actually do want to work on this, because you don't mean to be that way and want to make him more comfortable, which in turn will make your relationship stronger. 

talk about the specific behaviors that get to him, look into boundaries and forms of therapy maybe a couple's session, and express how you feel about him and the relationship and what you're willing to do to make it work.

This just happens in relationships, breaking points are learning experiences and there's nothing wrong with you, this is just a time to learn, time to open up your mind outside of any insecure thoughts and see the bigger picture. This is a good lesson in or out of this specific relationship! 

Find out in what ways he might like his alone time, like does he need to unwind for a few hours after work? Does he feel overwhelmed by text messages? (just an example, not saying you do this) things like that can be worked through

It could he more fundamental, as in maybe you struggle with aspects of anxious attachment and maybe he struggles with aspects of avoidant attachment, which is also something to consider. In that case it's all about educating yourselves on attachment theory, interpersonal effectiveness & boundaries.

He could have other factors adding to his stress as well, if this seemed out of nowhere. I mean with COVID and everything people seem to be more stressed as it is, and if there's other stressful environmental factors in his life like job stress it could attribute to this and the seemingly out of nowhere nature of it. 

Prioritize giving him space and respecting him while soothing and validating yourself. Those are hard things to hear and you need to be kind to yourself and know you're growing and on a journey, hell you're posting here to get help and that's a step in the right direction and it shows you care and that you want to get better.

You could say the whole internet Reddit thing about this post, about anything on here, I'm on about it and it's important to me because lack of accountability in our communities causes harm for pwBPD and families of pwBPD, you said you have BPD. This is something people in Borderline and recovery spaces talk about A LOT. I'm not doing this for fun or boredom, this is an actual important thing I'm saying here 

 I said that if you have BPD AT ALL, nonetheless concurrent/comorbid disorders, we should never ever speak with certainty that we are not abusive/toxic in our actions. I am strictly referring to what you said, which in any context would be you saying people point out your behavior to you and even then you can't stop it. I'm not calling you a bad person or attacking you, this community should be trying to help eachother go towards recovery and identifying potential problematic behaviors not reinforcing them or considering them something beyond our control

I will ""let it go"" but it sucks that you're as defensive as you are for emotional reasons and not willing to look at your behavior without an ""WELL I'D NEVER"" or absolute/all-or-nothing/certain statements.

Is that not referring to ineffective and problematic behavior?? What exactly are these people pointing out? What can't you stop? This is what I'm referring to

I'm not coming after you I still have not said that you are abusive, all I said was that you can't say with certainty that you are not. That no borderline should ever do this."
Borderline,fk1w325,t1_fk1v6ie,1583788016.0,"Why are people assuming that I don't have BPD???

What you're explaining is just dissociation during an episode, usually is spurred by adrenaline after a trigger, it in no way is a blackout. it's possible to have a bad memory of something that happened during that time, but while it's actually happening, as like a huge part of the comment section of this post is saying: we are completely aware of our toxic behavior while it's happening, it's like we are watching ourselves as the chaos unfolds. Which explicitly would not be black out. 

The reason why I'm saying any of these comments at all, is because this is a huge thing that I have learned in treatment from the teachings of Marsha linehan and my therapist, which I am trying to get you guys to understand, is that at no point does a borderline not have control over themselves and their actions, it can be incredibly hard, but whenever people say any form of statement that removes accountability like they blacked out, it's IMPOSSIBLE to not, they can't help it, they have to just watch all the ineffective behavior they chose to do just happen, they had no choice but to act the way they did because they have borderline and are mentally ill, or in any way excuse their actions because they have borderline and are not in treatment, is incredibly toxic

It keeps people from recovering and taking necessary accountability that leads to recovery

Taking accountability and recognizing that you're the master and commander of what happens during your episodes after youre triggered and that you can take steps even before even looking for a DBT program that can help now is critical

The belief that this is just the way borderline is, before we are in treatment we just are helpless and possessed by this personality disorder is not okay


The disorder sends strong emotional signals but doesn't force us to curse and say the things we do that hurt people, doesn't force us to throw things or self-harm, but it sure as hell can make us want to do those things impulsively, but in no way renders us completely helpless to not acting on those impulses

and before anybody says well lucky you you're in therapy and further along in your journey you can't possibly understand what we are going through, I am still experiencing the horrible throws of borderline, I am still experiencing horrible SI, still early on in my recovery, still experiencing the emotional anguish and trying my best to be effective interpersonally with my friends family and love interests, I still fuck up and am learning very hard lessons, I still often don't make the right choice, but understanding that it is my choice and always has been my choice has helped me more than anything else I've learned

I'm not speaking from a place that is holier than thou, I'm trying to say look this is what I learned, I really think you guys need to hear this right now

But in actuality I am saying :

hey OPs post is an example of problematic borderline behavior that is toxic and is a form of abuse, saying to people yeah I am treating you as if you're an enemy of mine and I don't give a fuck is a form of emotional invalidation and is a form of abuse, which is even evident in the way that the person emotionally responded, and if this post is relatable, and if saying that yeah I'm aware of my toxic behavior and can't do anything about it is relatable, then regardless of the specificities of your situation, that is absolutely when borderline's need to look at themselves, look at what's happening and take action in moving towards recovery and admitting that we have more control over our actions than we allow ourselves to think, and that even if it hurts to think that we could be hurting people and abusing them that we need to radically accept that it's a possibility 

If anyone is relating to OP and this situation, which I thought you were included in, should consider the points I'm making

Simply: 

""I can't be abusive, I am certain I am not abusive"" is a toxic thing, we should always be looking at ourselves analytically and questioning if we are being abusive, we should never be certain, and that having a curious mind about whether our actions are abusive or not is ultimately what will cause harm reduction, not saying oh hell no I'm not abusive

I am not trying to convince you that you are abusive, I am not here to be convinced by you whether or not you're abusive or not, I'm just saying that it is a possibility and that this post and the responses to this post that are like ""I also act in an incredibly toxic way and I'm fully aware of it and feel like I can't do anything about it"" is what I'm talking about"

I'm in no way undermining pain (where did I do that?) the only statement I'm saying is to say that at any point in having borderline someone does not have control is a toxic thing especially in support communities. Infantilizing ourselves is also incredibly toxic. 

I'm saying that even in the most extreme cases, and I'm not just saying this out of my ass this is completely what is taught in DBT this is coming from the beliefs of Marsha linehan herself, every single person with borderline has a choice in their actions. That isn't in any way undermining a single borderline, it's a statement of accountability, which is incredibly important, especially if people here want to eventually recover.

I think that professionals and people around us can let us know if our behavior is toxic but especially with how it's hard for borderlines to view things objectively without an emotional narrative prior to treatment, I really don't think that we can be certain about if we are objectively being abusive to people or not."

The disorder doesn't make us black out and wake up having done things we had no idea we did, you even said during the argument you posted that you didn't give a fuck, that's not BPD.

If you're not familiar with DBT skills & acronyms there's lots of free PDFs out there & youtube videos so see if you can explore the resources out there a bit if you can't afford DBT therapy right now.

First thing to do is take some space for yourself. Figure out if all of your personal care ducks are in a row, this is called the PLEASE skill. Things like eating enough, drinking enough, sleeping enough, if you're drinking/taking any mood altering substances (ex. sugar, caffeine) that are possibly causing irritability, and figuring out if you're getting enough exercise. 

Then it's all about mindfulness. Journaling, meditating and seeing what thoughts and emotions come up. Seeing what you're feeling in your body around this person, what you're thinking, what your perspective on the situation is, and once you identify your emotions, you move onto Checking The Facts. Do your emotions match the objective facts of what's happening? Figuring out how emotions may taint or spin objective facts into a perspective of events. Like ""she is just doing that to annoy me"" which assumes intent and isn't an objective fact. You can use a worksheet to figure this out.

 It seems like you feel they are mismatched, so when they don't match, we usually use Opposite Action or if the emotions do match the facts: we figure out a plan using Interpersonal Effectiveness and state boundaries if you want to maintain a positive relationship with this person, or use Distress Tolerance if you have to be around this person but don't necessarily want to maintain a relationship.

Simply put:

- take time for yourself, take care of all basic needs

- figure out what is frustrating you, and if it's really a misplaced emotion projected onto this person or a warranted emotion with Checking the Facts

- figure out how necessary the relationship is, what you want out of it/how you want it to be, if you want to maintain it, tolerate it or end it

- find out a way to communicate what you need while respecting yourself and the other person

Pro tip: if there's any feeling or urgency without danger, it's best to not act until that urgency goes away. It's best to tolerate the discomfort and make a decision when you feel better, because you're less likely to regret your actions and will have more of a chance to think them through."
