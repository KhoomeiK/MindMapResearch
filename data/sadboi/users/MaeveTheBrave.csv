writing,fr3jlu9,t3_gm9gij,1589858824.0,"Not something goofy or dumb, just something very necessary for my writing and that I've put a lot of time and effort into: learning and taking ASL classes in order to write for a deaf character (among other reasons).

I felt like it was important to thoroughly do my research for this one because I'm aware there is much more to sign language and overall deaf culture than I know about."
NoStupidQuestions,fr3hnxm,t1_fr1f04k,1589857624.0,"This is exactly why I wanted to go into film/TV, to make audiences feel things, have an experience, not just white noise. I heard a quote somewhere that ""movies should make you laugh, cry, or sit on the edge of your seat"", and that's always stuck with me for some reason.

I love that storytelling can be such a powerful medium, and that's essentially why I think art is so important (alongside STEM fields I mean), because it's our connection to each other."
NoStupidQuestions,fr3gv7f,t3_gm4ag6,1589857144.0,"This is happening to the She-Ra and the Princesses of Power fans right now. The show just aired its final season on May 15th, and ever since then, there has been this collective, surreal, but very palpable and powerful bittersweet-happiness in the fanbase (myself included) for the past 4 days straight.

Plus, there is this weird phenomenon going on in the very dedicated part of the fanbase where many people can't eat or sleep now, and (some) are even suffering other various increased depression-like symptoms. It's bizarre. I've never seen anything like this happen to a large group of people before (if anyone knows what this is called, I'd be really curious to know).

It hurts and I'm sad, like you said, that the show is over (for now... ??) and I'll have to say goodbye to these characters that I've grown so attached to. I feel like I've spent so much time with them over the past year or so, they've become a genuine part of my life and feel like friends to me. And now I'll never see them again... it hurts. Feels kind of like a breakup.

Yet, at the same time, I'm so proud of the show and everything it accomplished. I'm so happy how it turned out, but I just wish it wasn't ending... I'm not ready to say goodbye.

At least we still have fanart and fanfics though!"

I especially feel bad for those college students who paid to have a college experience, not just do mindless homework at home, or the seniors in college or HS who are losing the rest of their year to this. 

Honestly, colleges should be handing out refunds, cause I'm pretty sure these shitty versions of thrown-together online courses are not what they paid thousands of dollars for (at least in America).
