You should re-evaluate your life and put your time into something else other than trying to convince lesbians to like men. It's obvious you have some kind of weird obsession/fetish with lesbians and it's creepy as fuck. We don't like men, why is that so hard for people like you to understand."

GirlGamers,fqi02we,t3_giud91,1589387541.0,"It's been a while since I've played gta so forgive me if some of this information is wrong but I used to grind pretty much daily. First thing you want to do, in my opinion, is get an armoured kuruma, it's going to help you so much in grinding out missions. When you're making more money I would upgrade it to a deluxo, they're pretty expensive but it'll make everything a breeze. Have a look which missions are on 2x money and rp because this will help you to level up quicker. It sounds stupid but the longer you take to do the mission, the better the payout. There's in-depth guides on how long you should spend in a single mission and I'm pretty sure it's 6 minutes minimum. At 15 minutes you get max payout but it's better to do 2 six minute missions instead of waiting the full 15 minutes. You can do missions solo so I would recommend that when you become more comfortable with a mission because playing with randoms, most of the time they will rush through the mission not allowing you to get the full payout. The mission ""blow up"" is one of the most profitable missions you can do and also one of the easiest, it takes about 3 minutes to complete. 

As soon as you have enough money to buy an office purchase one, just a tip but the cheapest tends to have the most amount of griefers standing outside waiting to blow you up. The office will allow you to register as a ceo so you can do vip missions, one of the best is sightseer. After that buy your first business, the first one you should buy is either a bunker or an import export add on for your office. You don't have to but chumash is the best location for a bunker in my opinion because it's the closest to the centre of the map. It's a passive business which means you can make money while you do other things eg missions. The only downside is you have to do resupply missions to keep the product stocked up, this can become tedious but there is an option to buy supplies. 

The next businesses you should buy are either cocaine/weed followed by meth and counterfeit cash. Don't bother with document forgery or a hangar, unless you really want to. Another great business is crates but they're very difficult to fill up solo so being part of a specialised grinding crew would really help you out. A business people tend to overlook is the nightclub, most people think it's useless but in my opinion it's one of the easier businesses to maintain and the payout is pretty good.

It's going to be really difficult at first, rockstar make it as hard as possible for new players. Join a grinding crew, never sell in public sessions and try not to take it too seriously, just have fun with it :) I hope I managed to help!"
