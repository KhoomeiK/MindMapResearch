xboxone,fqolyvf,t1_fqno5nj,1589518415.0,You don’t have to have HDMI 2.1. 2.1 allows 4K@120 FPS and VRR but other than that you’re perfectly fine with a TV with 2.0. HDMI 2.1 won’t be in most households for a while. LG has the only ones for now and the new lineups this year will be where it begins for most other brands though Sony left it off some of their models strangely enough.

You’d be surprised how much of an advantage it can give you in multiplayer games like BFV where resolution can decide if a player is a visible enemy or a smeared pixel.
CFB,fpbmwy3,t3_gci13r,1588473731.0,Ole Miss Vs Auburn when both teams were competing for playoff aspirations. Treadwell catches the ball and his leg snaps on the way in. We all thought he scored and went crazy. We didn’t realize he was injured at first. Then the medical staff comes out and the review says he didn’t score. We lost our best player and the game at once plus hearing the opposing fans go crazy over it while our season feels destroyed really put the cherry on top.

Most PC gamers don’t use 4k and rely more on high frame rates so some of the extra power being used in the consoles won’t be an apples to apples comparison. Also, mods, emulators, and a fully backwards compatible library can’t really be matched by consoles. I’ll get them because I love video games and the simplicity of having a living room setup that doesn’t require anything that my wife and kids might struggle with but the great thing about building PC’s isn’t solely about power."

For the devs who choose to go the more “artistic direction”, VRR will still be a great benefit say if games drop to the 40’s-60’s."

It doesn’t always go away even when you do it all right so I feel you. Regarding the TV, I’m embarrassed to say that I returned way too many televisions before settling on OLED and like you, I obsessed about it forever, like to the point where it would keep me up which is directly tied with my mental issues. It was computers last year. It’s usually deeper than that but that’s another story. 

My best advice would be to just go with it if you want it and stay away from researching the negative things because it will snow ball.

Over half had dead pixels somewhere. It used to bug me because I used my TV’s as a monitor. However, even that wasn’t that noticeable. Normal viewing distances = no issue.

Here’s a review that talks a little about the differences between the B9 and C9. I do wish I had the C9’s stand but the OS is more than fast enough for me especially compared to Android. 

https://www.cnet.com/reviews/lg-oled65b9pua-review/"
OLED,ff0lixm,t3_er2ixe,1579470002.0,The B9 is a great tv and I hope you aren’t basing the second reason off of a YouTube video or the post on the 4K subreddit. Every company will invest in MicroLED at some point. It won’t be affordable soon though.
4kTV,feybslq,t1_fex71yz,1579443418.0,"Same feeling here. 

“This does not mean LG Electronics will step back from its earlier commitment to embrace the OLED TV business. It means, from a business standpoint, that LG will regard its push for the OLED TV market as a ""strategic investment"" that will set the advanced TV technology roadmap for years.”

I mean, yeah...MicroLED may be the future when it’s cost efficient but as for now, the best PQ at a reasonable price is an OLED. LG would be silly not to invest in a future technology. Hell, LCD’s have been making minor improvements with marketing ploys like QLED for years yet the tech keeps on."
4kTV,fepfhbt,t3_eqaotx,1579319190.0,Why don’t you like Roku TV’s? The TCL’s are very responsive and have tons of apps. I’ve got a 930e and agree that Android is a little slow on that model but honestly an external device remedies that for a fraction of the cost of the TV. I’ve got an LG B9 and love the pointer but there’s a lack of apps so I use a Fire TV and a Roku on my other TV. Just find a TV you like and get one of the many streaming devices.
4kTV,feoeqo1,t3_eq4pyb,1579299113.0,OLED all the way.
4kTV,fel30h7,t3_eplc46,1579212959.0,I returned Q80 for the B9. Definitely go with the B9.
