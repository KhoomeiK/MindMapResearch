Most anarchists support ideas like local direct democracy, workplace democracy and community watches as stand-ins for police. Other anarchists argue that this is another government in all but name.

Anyway, I think the only realistic way to achieve anarchism (or, libertarian socialism, it's about to get very complex if this is knew for you) is for towns to basically secede from the central government by kicking out their police and mayor, [this happened in Mexico in 2011](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37612083)."

One theory it pushes forward is that the government banned alcohol to improve soldiers discipline during World War I, which meant it lost a third of its income (from alcohol taxes) and so it couldn't pay its soldiers, who sided with other factions."
Anarchism,fr1rb1j,t3_gm2naw,1589824612.0,"I'm not aware of any anarchist theorists who have addressed this question, but various social movements have still stood up to the government during periods of social democracy.

I vaguely recall reading somewhere that social democracy actually makes protests more likely since people can get *too comfortable* and feel secure in revolting. This is basically what happened in the late 1960s and early 1970s as people had a lot of job security, the post war economic boom and social services. Some notable events from that time include:
