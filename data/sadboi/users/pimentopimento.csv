I may try to see if I can contact emergency services there and possibly give them his Snapchat for his location because I’m not sure how much longer he plans on staying alive. I appreciate your response so much!"

mentalhealth,f4drix1,t3_dew5hf,1571546521.0,"Hi there! I’m a little new to Reddit, but I saw your post title and felt like I might be able to offer some insight :)

People often self-harm for a number of reasons, and the best way to get an answer is probably through seeing a therapist that you feel comfortable with and perhaps reflecting on what events/thoughts precede the act of self-harm for you. You mentioned having feelings of hatred or disgust for yourself. I have no way of knowing if this is why you self-harm, but these feelings could potentially have made self-harming easier. 

Regardless, I’m sorry to hear that these feelings have been bothering you; it sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of guilt, and that can be incredibly painful. Something that is often helpful when I feel remorseful over a decision is to imagine someone else you know in the same place as you. Imagine someone that you care about had made the same decision you did, and they expressed to you these feelings of disgust and thoughts of self-harm. My first thought would be that they’ve clearly taken accountability for their decision, and I would see no reason to feel anger towards them because they recognized their mistake and that there’s no reason for them to hurt themselves over it. 

This process is simply a way to view your guilt in a detached and objective way. Often times, viewing our own lives as if it were someone else’s is often easier for us to provide advice to. In this way, we can handle these feelings in a more manageable way. You can apply this same method when you’re having other questions about yourself as well. 

Your post alone appeared really well-thought-out, and you seem like you’d be more than capable of problem-solving in that way. The main reason I bring this up is because I’ve been clean from self-harm for quite some time, and I find that this is often helpful. 

If you have any questions or would just like to talk, feel free to PM or just reply :)"
