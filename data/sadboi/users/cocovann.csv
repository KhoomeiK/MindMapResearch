yurts,fpeh5bl,t3_gckepk,1588547454.0,My bf and I lived in a geodesic dome home and he loved it. It had insulated walls and an asphalt roof so not exactly a yurt but similar. The sounds traveled differently in it I remember. A yurt would be definitely some getting used to.

cool about your post-do you speak Japanese? I have always wanted to go there."
lonely,fkb7el8,t3_fhfouz,1584027607.0,"If you don’t have anything to talk about you can just ask people questions about stuff THEY like to talk about. Then the attention shifts to them and most people like to talk about themselves so it’s an easy trick to get the convo going. Become a good listener, too and you will make friends much easier even if you feel you have nothing to offer in a conversation people will appreciate an active listener. Active meaning repeating back what they say.  Hope that helps you some."

kratom,fk0n2no,t3_ffu0yk,1583761456.0,He’s treating you like shit because you are attempting to medicate your anxiety and depression so that you can function and be happy. I’d say “dump the loser” and be happy you found something that helps you cope. Life is too hard to feel bad about trying to help yourself with a plant.
AskReddit,fk0c90f,t1_fjzx1u1,1583751865.0,Good one -it is nice!

MakeNewFriendsHere,fjg9fx2,t3_fcvpte,1583317971.0,Holy cow that’s a lot of dogs! Most I have had at once was 3 but it was also the happiest I have been too.

emotionalabuse,fipwq3w,t3_f8v1gf,1582625391.0,That’s definitely emotional abuse and he’s gaslighting you too. Read “Why does he do that” it’s all about emotionally abusive relationships. Also the nice stuff after is called “love bombing”. It completely f**** with your head. They do it all to keep you constantly off balance and questioning your sanity. Sound familiar?
domesticviolence,fipaxa5,t3_f8zid6,1582602077.0,I am glad you’re safe now. That’s all that matters.
domesticviolence,fim2tir,t3_f8k573,1582516632.0,"I am in a similar situation though the physical violence is not as bad as you are experiencing. I am so sorry he’s hurting you like this. I just emailed the top advocate for under represented people in the population who works for the local city government. I am asking her for a direct line to a specific domestic violence advocate so that I can talk to someone who can help me not just a call center and not a cop. If I get some help from her, it will be a miracle, but I have some hope left. My ex husband used to make me have sex with him all the time for yrs. I am now with another man who abuses me daily. It feels f****** hopeless most days. 

If you want to talk I am here for you message me.

Otherwise I hope you will keep reaching out for help and try to find an advocate of DV who is trained to help survivors just like you. Hope you feel better soon."
