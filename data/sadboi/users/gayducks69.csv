askteenboys,fkoxuex,t1_fkotiha,1584397396.0,"Imagine the following scenario:  a drug addicted driver of a lorry decides to check into a rehab, after drugs are legalized because he doesn't fear being punished anymore. Because of that he doesn't accidentally blow up his lorry. 
And yes of course it shouldn't be legal to drive while high, noone ever argued about that.


If drugs are prohibited because you can't control your actions then explain why alcohol is legal.  Everyday 36 people die because of alcohol in the US alone. And no we should not prohibit alcohol use, we all know how that turned out.


When drugs are legalized you're less likely to get robbed by junkies because for example there are less junkies because they can easier get help earlier and are more educated about drugs, making them less likely to become addicted. 


I never argued for the use of drugs, I argued for a safer society where drug addicts can easier come forward and get help, where drug use is less stigmatized and addiction being treated as a health condition rather than a crime and people qre better educated about drugs.


Switzerland gave out free, high quality heroin alongside clean needles and access social workers. What happened? Since this program first started opioid related deaths decreased by 64%, people starting heroin use has declined by 80%, HIV infections by 65%, and 2/3 of these drug users got a regular job after starting that program"

askteenboys,figl7ep,t3_f7v0k5,1582400936.0,"All drugs should be legalized because

1. Prohibition isn't effective, has never been effective and will continue being not effective.  The reason why people don't take drugs is because they're dangerous, not because they're illegal (for the most part). Ask yourself: would you take crystal meth if its legal? Probably not.
As long as there is demand for drugs people will take it. What the government should be doing is reducing the demand by

2. helping addicts overcome their addiction and help people who struggle so they don't development unhealthy coping mechanisms like taking drugs, and that is much easier once drugs are legalized. 

3. Organized crime has a monopoly on the illegal drug markets. The government is missing out on a lot of potential tax money that they could use to fight drug addiction. Also the government spends tons of money fighting crime that is related to drugs and drug trade and people who can't afford drugs and have to steal things to afford drugs. 
While it doesn't eliminate all crime related to drugs and organized crime it is by far the cheapest and most effective way to combat organized crime.

4. Many illegal drugs are laced with other substances that are often much more harmful than the drug itself. Imagine smoking rat poison or injecting something containing glass fragments. Also concentration of drugs vary with different dealers making an accidental overdose much much more likely

5. The prohibition of drugs has given birth to many new, cheaper and often more dangerous substances that are barely researched, making the treatment of an OD more difficult. 

6. Which drugs are legal and which aren't are completely arbitrary. Alkohol and Tobacco are legal even though they are one of THE most dangerous and addictive common drugs on the planet while shrooms, one of the least toxic drugs and least addictive drugs, are illegal.

7. Education about safe consumption is much more difficult while drugs are illegal. Legalization would remove the stigma around drugs to a certain extent which would enable an honest and open discussion around drugs and drug consumption. The reason why people don't fear being drunk is because people know how much is ok and how much is dangerous. 

8. Some illegal drugs have positive effects that can be used in medicine. Some of those illegal drugs have less side effects than the medicine we take now. 
Shrooms for example are one of the least dangerous drugs for your physical body. Studies have shown that shrooms therapy is much more effective than meds and conventional therapy for treating depression.  Also shrooms have a _more than 80% success rate_ at treating nicotine addiction, more than double any other type of treatment. Also studies have shown that shrooms can help a physically damaged brain recover."
