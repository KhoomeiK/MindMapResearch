MechanicalKeyboards,fdernsd,t1_fdep3w4,1578345183.0,how do you like the keycaps?
MechanicalKeyboards,fderfv7,t1_fdeq9bi,1578345053.0,I use Browns and only recently had the chance to try Zealios and Holy Pandas.  The contrast really makes Browns feel like funky linears :(

vaporents,fbqzid9,t1_fbqyi3o,1577037348.0,I would look at short session vapes like the fury edge (5 min) or something on demand like a dynavap.  there’s other on demand stuff like mv1 ghost or a 510 threaded too.  I think most vapes will be quicker than 20 minutes as long as you pack quickly or use dosing capsules.  Stay warm!
MechanicalKeyboards,faboskm,t1_fab77zh,1575926462.0,I think GMK modern dolch with muted mods

vaporents,f6n5hcn,t3_ds0qep,1572985109.0,The best deal I found rn is on puffitup where you get a free grinder with purchase
vaporents,f3pzbqt,t3_dhnunt,1571067282.0,For 150 you can get the Fury Edge.  I just got one and enjoy it so far coming from some 200+ vapes.
vaporents,f3mlnlg,t3_dh5ifm,1570989843.0,I just got one recently and really enjoy it. It’s good for small amounts with the capsules which is saving me money and time as it’s super easy to clean/load.
NoStupidQuestions,f31q46v,t1_f31psh5,1570581820.0,I'm grateful I'm learning there are more options out there! I'm going to do some research on local credit unions as well as Ally and make the switch. Thanks again :)
NoStupidQuestions,f31puco,t1_f31n684,1570581624.0,I really struggled to see it as anything but a money making scheme but I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something :(  I hope more banks allow you to see every transaction in the future.  I believe PayPal allows you see every single one or at least more than a couple years.
NoStupidQuestions,f31pneu,t1_f31n6sq,1570581484.0,Thank you for the suggestion I've seen credit unions mentioned a lot on Reddit however my entire family and many people I know in my state use Citizens.  I hate the bank with a passion so I'll make the move soon!
trees,f31emdn,t1_f2sl2e7,1570573757.0,I feel like alcohol in itself is a liability we just don’t tend to treat it as such.
vaporents,f2wyej1,t1_f2vgnzy,1570471652.0,thank you! I’ll probably end up getting the edge in that case :)
vaporents,f2uo9i8,t1_f2unjmq,1570422441.0,it’s so difficult to decide! I love having the ability to replace batteries on the go with the Argo but several people have commented on it taking too long to extract. I think I’ll get the edge soon because of the capsules like you mention and usb c charge is quick enough to not necessarily need extra batteries.
vaporents,f2uo2qh,t1_f2unf6k,1570422256.0,somehow I confused the Argo with the edge. I thought planet of the vapes carried the edge as well :(
vaporents,f2ukydp,t1_f2uintj,1570419382.0,hey how do you like the Argo? I want to pull the plug on buying it but there’s just so many other vapes to consider.
vaporents,f2ukjn8,t1_f2ugzeo,1570419053.0,check planet of the vapes as well I think it’s the same deal but you get a small jar too
wholesomememes,f2ng26g,t1_f2n952j,1570315585.0,"Exactly.  Idk how anybody wants to live that life in the meme.  It’s 100% honorable and people who do so are amazing, but how can you summon the energy to do this for your whole life?"

depression,f2f9jyw,t3_dd7uld,1570213511.0,I’m looking at this in my bed right now.  Sometimes it sucks because I just want to sleep it all away but I’m left here staring at the ceiling or my phone for hours.
depression,f27g24z,t1_f27espm,1570037419.0,Exactly! I don’t understand the approach we have to suicide at least in the US right now.  My psychiatrist told me to call 911 if I have more suicidal thoughts. Already did that once and it was the worst experience of my life.
