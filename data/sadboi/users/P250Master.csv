I hope there's someone near you who can help you out...
Bless your heart brother"

Best thing I've learned so far is to love yourself first (immensely). Start working on yourself and the right people will notice.

Cheers pal!

Now I don't know how your relationship with your parents is. But I recommend starting to seek help with them, because they have been there for you all your life (I hope I'm right, if not my apologies). It's what I did, and I'm on my way to getting my shit together again, all be it a bumpy ride.

You are an intelligent man, and I think you know that drugs will eventually destroy you and fuck you up for the rest of your life. Your chances of becoming successful are even greater than mine, I wish I was an honorary student and had a paper like you. 

My experiences taught me that the road to healing starts with yourself. No one is going to help you in this fucking world. As hard as it may sound, take action, grab life by the balls/pussy and start talking to your parents. Don't become a bitter person like me.

Godspeed, young man"
