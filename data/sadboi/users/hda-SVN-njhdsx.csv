mentalillness,fqdj2tp,t3_gi7ftq,1589290750.0,"First ask yourself are these thing subjectively or objectively awful? 

If objective, is there anything that can be done to reconcile the act? 

If subjective, question why you hold that as awful against yourself, if you would not to someone else? 

This one is a rabbit hole my friend"
mentalillness,fqb6oj3,t3_ghkdrc,1589231525.0,"Firstly, I’m sorry that you’ve gone through such an awful experience and that it continues to happen. 

Secondly, here is my best advice for getting through the reply (or at the very least this is what I would do). No more putting it off, you have to do this. This is your fight back and you’re going to do it right. The next day you have off wake up, have breakfast, and then reply to or call the detective. Get as much information across as possible and do the best you can. Then give yourself the rest of the day to do whatever you need to do after reopening that scar again. 

The reason I say that is because at the moment it’s this horrible task looming in the back of your mind that you’re yet to accomplish, and you know it’s going to bring you down after you do it. It’s crap to do, it’s crap to recover from, and no one can do anything to change it being a crap experience. At some point you have to tackle it head on and until you do the mental fatigue of it looming in your background will weigh you down. 

Thirdly, do you currently have a mental health professional in your support network? Someone who is external to your situation can help you to learn how to process these thoughts and move towards healing, not just squash them down to survive. 

I hope all of that doesn’t come across too harshly, I mean to help not to hinder."

But even then my first thought is if she woke you up, you go check on her? Why do you have to wake me up to deal with this?"

The understand myself quiz has helped a lot and is quick to do, so it gives you a great baseline. I wasn’t committing fully the first few times but I am now determined to follow through and become who I am meant to be, so it’s a great time to dust off and try again."

Your mind must go through the full process of grief before it can recover from it. There are no shortcuts, and it’s awful, but it is a process and it might be helpful to look into how that process works. Have you ever discussed the grief process or read into it before?"

SuicideBereavement,fkyjybc,t3_fldxuz,1584650231.0,"I’m selfish out of love too. I have a tendency to over care and over reach out to others. I wish I had control over my emotions and the power they have over me. 
If I’m honest, it’s also trying to escape my own mind by emptying it into others. But emptying all of my thoughts out of my mouth doesn’t make my head any less full. 

It’s so important to focus on self care right now. Take care of your body and let your mind catch up at a later date. Go through the motions of three meals a day, shower daily, sleep early, gentle exercise such as a walk even if it’s just around the block. Look after your physical body and allow your mind to heal. Try not to judge yourself... you’re going through a lot right now"

Once it is habitualised it’s categorised itself as a subconscious mechanism. You’re legit not making a conscious thought to want to, wanting it is just part of your biological clock now. 

But, look at us! We’ve both acknowledged that it’s habitual and we’re working through that. We’ve got this."

Sometimes it drives me crazy to be so naturally difficult and abrasive to others.
