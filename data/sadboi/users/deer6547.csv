DeathStranding,fhk51oe,t3_f3mvok,1581667144.0,"I think it was initially designed to be hardcore survival game. They (NPCs) always say how dangerous it is to be outside, and no one leaves bunkers because of it, but actually you roam around just fine without any problem at all. I am disappointed about how easy this game is, even though I was playing on hard. Maybe they changed direction at some point when realized, that hardcore gloomy survivals are not particularly marketable."
buildapc,fgjzzde,t3_eysra5,1580854710.0,"I have terrorized my wife for 3 years with my desire for building a new PC, while we had very tight budget of 1.5 minimal wages, but eventually situation improved and I have saved where it's reasonable and built $5k overkill + spent $600 on RGB garbage additions year later. Usually I watch youtube on it and play on my PS4, which I bought as a cheap option to play games while saving. But sense of just having it is pleasant, it's what I have always wanted. Sadly I don't have much free time now, especially time when I am focused enough to play games, so even my RGB stuff and sleeved cables just lie around for two months already and I can't find a free day when I'm not half dead to install all of it and also feel something in the process. Starting university with full time job is rough in 30s."
QuakeChampions,fgizwf4,t1_fgit92m,1580834323.0,"Well, I do play regularly and enjoy the game generally. 

But. 

I have overpowered PC, so I don't see poor performance. I don't play ranked, so I don't care about sound. In terms of balance I find CTF pretty much broken (in other modes balance is relatively okay for me, though). There is still very annoying bug in menus for me, and I'm tired of playing same few maps over and over again."

depression,fgblbfn,t1_fgbiazb,1580663333.0,"I understand, it's common situation. Where I lived it wasn't especially expensive to get a degree, but the level of education isn't good either, so I ended up wasting like 7 years in university, just because I was told, that I need to get a degree. I got mental breakdown instead in the end, and now when I am really understand what and why I want to learn I have to start to learn everything again at age of 30 while working full time.
So much time wasted for nothing, but creating mental problems. I better be off working in the real world for a few years before going into education.
But I believe that I can get my degree now and move on in life, and I believe, that you also able to overcome your debt and depression and came out on top in the end. This journey will not be nice for both of us, but it's possible to make it trough."
depression,fgbfoia,t3_exj07n,1580661613.0,"Well, why did you take the loan in the first place, if you wasn't ready to pay it? I know student debt is crushing in the US, and I don't even live there."

DeathStranding,fg5yp25,t1_fg4ykop,1580544748.0,"I think you get ""contributed to repair"" message when someone builds his own road and puts materials into the terminal. I never go around and fix anything, because it's very, very time consuming, and you have to dig up a lot of resources too."
hebrew,fg31jtv,t3_ewjieq,1580466019.0,"Never saw people writing ה like this. The short line must be straight and vertical. Often people write it almost exactly like ק. Your כ looks more like reversed ט, make it more horizontal and it shouldn't stick out of line."
