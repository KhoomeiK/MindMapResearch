I obsessively learned how to fit others, likely because of my bpd. So I learned about mental health disorders, suicide prevention, the little things that make someone click on a general scale. For the wrong reasons, but I learned. And I think a lot of people don't have the healer spirit I've always been told I have, and it doesn't seem to just.. be a thing they think about, you know?

But the actual abusers / users and so on.. I have no excuses for them, and if someone consciously does it, I can't make them. I've dealt with my fair share.

But my job pays pretty well for the area (ten an hour). And I'm struggling, hard. I've been just trying to carefully walk the line, catch up, pay my bills on time, and even that's been failing. 
That's.. so depressing. A, I think about the people on min wage, and that just gives me immediate anxiety FOR them and I wonder how the hell they make it work. And B, I just want the same thing this person wants. Stability, a small place of my own where I don't have to deal with a shithead roommate who doesn't care or help, someone I care about, a job where I don't have to struggle so hard.
I always hear ""go to school."" Tried that. One semester at SHSU, I owe them eight thousand. Part of that's on my end, between pressure and youthfully not knowing how to manage myself that. I haven't been able to pay my payments in like, half a year. Then again at the community college here. I fell behind on classes, and turns out if you fail a class, you have to pay back the whole FAFSA. So, I owe them too. 
Literally had to take out a loan to pay shit on time this month, and I was finally on track, with a job that starts next month part time in addition to my job I have now, where I can finally work on really catching up, so I can get the dental work I need done, and just.. not be struggling. Aaaand my car had a problem today on the road, had to point people to go around my car and everything (tow truck guy thinks it's the spark plugs, I hope he's right). Though I did get to ride in a tow truck, so that was cool, and met nice police officers who helped, and that was cool too. I've just pushed it in my mind today instead of letting myself deal with that thought chain, and as it's been sinking in over the last hour, this post just sorta popped the top for me.
I work all the time, and if I'm not working, I'm trying to spend time with friends on a videogame because I need some semblance of happiness, don't have friends I can meet in person, and don't have the spare money to spend anyway.
It's no fucking wonder we all have mental health issues. 
If you're going through shit right now too, I hope my hope adding to yours can do you some good. Maybe we'll all have stable lives in little houses of our own sometime soon."
