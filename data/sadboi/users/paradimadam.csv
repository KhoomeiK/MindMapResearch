However for the airlines - check other comment - it comes to a bunch of variations, including possible discrimination if people with disabilities who had to take heavy wheelchair or some other gear has to pay more. Another variation is that the fuel is only a part of the price,  and probably quite small, when compared to salaries and the price of plane, of maintenance, of airport rent and other bunch of fees that are not weight related. 

Just searched online a bit: found [this](https://www.aardvarkcompare.com/blog/airline-fuel-costs-ticket-price) article - probably be a bit old, orher sources mentions up to 10% of cheapest ticket price, but you got the idea."
pussypassdenied,fjhh86s,t1_fjhe9oj,1583348063.0,"You mentioned some limits every x lbs, it is one thing.

However,  another thing you need to think about is general maintenance and salaries. OK, for example, no big people are flying. You get 5 -20 small people with small bags. However, you have also have to pay for plane parking, maintenance, cleaning, bags load and unload,  salaries, various taxes... fuel price for transporting just big people is not a very big part of it, I think. Otherwise flying an airplane with one person or a few babies would be WAY cheaper than flying a full plane. And I actually doubt it.

So it is a balance between what is more profitable - to rise prices for heavier people and hope that enough of them flies to keep the profits, or keep current pricing? And I believe that quite a bit profit comes from business and higher classes,  not from tiny economy class people.

Also, where do we put a weight limit? Who decides it? If it depends on height +some bags,  what weight limit would you put for person without legs? What about disabled people who might have to take some heavier gear (be it some more advanced wheelchair +bags, or service pet)? 

So while it might sound good from first glance, it is basically saying that most asian people (who usually tend to be shorter) will pay less than, e.g., most scandinavians or other people who tend to be taller - and it is just because of genetics/race - they couldn't choose their heigth. It is slippery slope towards discrimination, and it could lead to other extremes from people who want to minimize weight.

I don't write even my personal journal every day If I had to create something every day in addition to other tasks and homework... 

There are people who are naturally creative, there are people that are naturally good in math or languages, but forcing the issue to the extreme won't help, just will make it either mechanical and dumb, or make them hate it. Does repeating helps? Yes. However I see more benefits in changing it a bit: e.g. one day writing diary, another reading a part of bookand summarizing it, third day maybe describing the movie or arguing at news article, and third day again diary. That gives you way to write, to see how other write, to be creative, but also not sticking on the routinal ""I got up, went to school, ate, did homework,  wrote this diary, went to sleep"", which does not look very useful.

But the task of this is to be creative and learn to put thoughts nicely. If you are simply trying to fill the sheet, it won't happen. Give it once a week or so - you cannot press creative part.

Of course, if their goal is only to out daily routine to writing, then it is achieved. But it is a bit like ""oh, you have eyes and you recognize nice views, you definitely can take photos of them or draw pictures"".

However other question is - does that bother me? I would say - not particularly. I do have some really good friends (though they live quite a bit away), some less close acquaintances that I still can ask for help if needed. I have people I connect on specific interests. That's enough for me."

AmItheAsshole,fivz3qp,t1_fivrw8s,1582771327.0,"I think most childfree people have the mentality that ""you can have your kids if you parent them and if they do not disturb my life"" (not all, mind you, there are really malicious ones - like everywhere). 

But most people, childfree or no, won't care if your kid that is old enough to be reasoned with is not loud or annoying in the airplane. However, if you allow them to run through the aisle,  kick the back of chair in front, run their game loud without headphones and chat/scream loud enough to disturb other people WITHOUT trying to stop, I guess not only childfree people might start to doubt your decision to have a kid (and actually, there is where word ""breeder"" comes in - because such people do not parent their kids, they just give birth to them and feel entitled just because of that fact that they had kids. Most people that have kids are parents, not breeders. The ones that do not parent... well).

So while I understand that having kids does not mean they are always reasonable and quiet, I do not care if people have them or not, until the kids are really disturbing other people, and mommy dearest only acts angry that other people are not impressed by her ""perfect baby"" (which is actually far from perfectly behaving). 

And about this situation - the OP is definitely NTA. The running away can be explained by high stress situation, but both husband and MIL are definitely JustNO"

TalesFromRetail,fivhj3f,t1_fivg6gd,1582760407.0,"I am not arguing how it is in sales point. I am just saying how it can appear from prices point for customer.

I paid 50% of what I would pay if there would be no discount (be it BOGO 1 free or 50% off when you buy 2 identical items).

Again, I don't say that the sale works like this, only that on specific conditions (buying 2 identical priced products) it can be seen from customer side as 50% off two identical items only if they buy 2.

In this specific case it is more the way to see how much you saved - 50%."

So... you can't compare.

Though sometimes you don't even want to put your problems out when you read something really bad - as it might appear as whinning about the minor things. There should be a limit somewhere - a teenager telling how bad it is for them as they did not get the latest model car from parents this year is totally different than someone who needs car for living and got it broken down, and can't pay for repairs.

The issue is how and where to put that line. In this case it is pretty much clear, but what about more gray areas? If someone is spending money on expensive purchases and comes to cry that they have no money to repair said car? Or what about putting that something small broke  on yoir car just after waranty ended when somebody else writes how their car was totaled? Would that be whining? 

 Again, same with ""glad"" things: when you read that someone with depression today got out of the bed and brushed their hair after x months,  you don't want to put out that you reached the stage where you do some small action, while at the same time going to work and not having ""can't get out of the bed for months"" problem."

PenmanshipPorn,fisqfmh,t1_fisozt8,1582690579.0,"I am from Lithuania,  Europe. We actually were required to write cursive during all school.

And no, I have not posted here anything. My handwriting is not bad, but it is not good enough to post here, at least in my opinion - it is not smooth enough. Just because I write in cursive a lot, does not mean I write perfectly, especially for everyday notes (where I basically grab my notebook and write aomething to the To Do list, even without the table and with any pen), so it is definitely not a perfected penmanship as here. But I can give a link to photo of such my everyday notes to message, if you are really very interested (or I could try writing something nicer tomorrow at work at the table - though still not with ink pen)"
PenmanshipPorn,fisgmdb,t1_fiscst4,1582684466.0,"Ah, I see.

I am from country where cursive is common, even now - so there pretty much everyone writes cursive and reads it reasonably well. My all lectures notes were (and probably still are, if not thrown out yet) in cursive, and people made photocopies saying that it is easy to read (I personally wouldn't say that my cursive is perfect - I needed glasses during the first classes I was learning it, but I didn't know that yet),  and I have two a bit distinct styles, but it is better than some), but I literally learned nice printed letters (not the capital ones that kids try on their own before starting to learn writing) only in drafting class when I was about 15.

Of course, our cursive is a bit simplified compared to English one - less loops on letters.

If we did labs with report to provide later - we did notes to our paper, and later put that to computer into nice report with additional conclusions and so. 

But I guess the issue was that some countries see cursive as something not very usual and difficult to read :) but I write everything in cursive even now - my diary, my planner, my notes - unless I have to print some information to someone, than I usually put in capital printed letters."

AskReddit,firhi1a,t1_fipxl98,1582664494.0,"It is not always the taste issues. I do like some veggies due to taste (though nothing would compare a shop tomatoe to the one from your own plant), but I avoid more of them because of the distress they cause to my GI tract. I had to stop eating veggies several times in restaurants or airplanes, because they were making me nauseous. I also can have am adverse reaction to other already prepared stuff from shop (like creamed spinach with something) or even homemade veggies/fruit smoothie (though this one usually not with nausea, but still GI tract distress).

I have to limit most of my veggies input to mostly what I had in childhood - fresh veggies mostly from my birth timezone, some types of them cooked into the soup or stew. If these are more advanced veggies (even bell peppers) or more advanced preparation (advanced veggies concoctions in restaurants), I am no longer even touching them due to multiple bad experiences."

But it felt like it suctioned a couple days period out of uterus in 10 minutes... together with all the pain, combined.  I did still feel pain at the cervix after taking 800mg ibuprofen (recommended by doctor). Totally killed any warmer feelings for anything cup type And because I find problems to find space for cup to pop-out in diameter, I don't think it is worth buying disks (especially as I have no one to pass them to, also if they are single-use, I see no big ecological impact). 

And finally, I never reached the stage with the cup where I could feel safe, unless like with tampon. Cup is full - I feel like I got waterfall open. Tampon is full - I feel leaking, but it acts like a cork for me. This is one of the main reasons I really doubted how one can wear cups: my super tampons sometimes comes out squished in shape (flattened or so, not lengthwise) because there aren't too much space there, where the hell there would be space for cup? I know the baby comes out through there, but it never came out through mine, and period makes everything more narrow/swollen than usual. It is literally,  ""where can it fit""?"
