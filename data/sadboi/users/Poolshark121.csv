paralegal,fmpj20q,t1_fmpio4w,1586281726.0,Unfortunately I have to agree that it'll take someone close to her to make her take it seriously. Good luck out there. T's and P's for you and yours.
paralegal,fmpii5n,t1_fmphoux,1586281441.0,Don't get me wrong I'm happy and thankful to have a job to work at. I just think that everyone isn't treating this as serious as they should. Like my boss is out and about and then coming to the office. If I get it then I might give it to my wife and she's a home health care nurse. That could end up with one nurse off the board and my household without money at all. Then my boss is at 50% capacity with that scenerio so.... Staying at home would be best for all long term.
paralegal,fmph2l2,t1_fmpgxm2,1586280708.0,It's something although everything I'm doing in the office can be done at home so I don't really see the point.

I've seen the Pueblo almost every day of my life and it looks backwards. Gorgeous though my heart was beating so fast when I heard Taos. Thank you so much for getting people to talk about home
