awakened,fq5c3mx,t3_ggxbvb,1589099738.0,"""love and light"" is not any path to enlightenment. Enlightenment is nurtured from pain and suffering because existence is pain and it is suffering. Without existence there is no enlightenment, no light and dark, no good and bad. Enlightenment is knowing and perceiving that everything is one. Good is bad and bad is good. The taoists have a saying that goes something like this, ""an enlightened one can walk through a field and do nothing, yet nothing goes undone."" The universe is perfect. Even the horrible atrocities experienced every day on this earth are perfect. Even your own dissatisfaction with the universe is perfect. It would not be another way.

Anyone who is selling ""love and light"" is a crock of shit. They are trying to guide you down a path of ""feel good"" spirituality inspired by monetary interests. Believe it or not telling people that getting into spirituality is gonna hurt like hell doesn't sell well.

If you want to understand yourself you need to be honest. Being honest with yourself means directly confronting all of the ways you are capable of doing wrong and causing others pain. You are capable of the most heinous of crimes and not only that it would be easy for you to do. You are no different than the worst people who have ever walked this planet. I mean hell, if everything is one you literally are those people. That doesn't sound fun does it. That doesn't sound like ""love and light."" And you're right it's not. Enlightenment means knowing all of this, accepting it, and above all choosing to be at peace with it.

Existence is suffering, suffering is freedom.

researchchemicals,fo5awip,t1_fo59all,1587521340.0,"Alright, I appreciate your insight. I think sticking with psychedelics is a good idea. The reason why I stopped taking substances was because I realized I didn't like my life and I was using them to escape. I think ketamine would just give me another reason to escape my life and that's not what I want.

It's a long story but basically I have had two psychotic episodes and I am currently on medication because of that. However these psychotic episodes are believed to be related to trauma and sleep issues. I use psychedelics as a tool for spiritual growth and I am very forthcoming with all of my health providers about my year long sobriety coming to an end and my intent to take recreational substances including what substances I am taking. All of them have said that they would hate to see psychedelics negatively impact my progress but I think that is unlikely and the benefits outweigh the risks."

AmItheAsshole,fl4wmwc,t3_fmfvw7,1584823195.0,"YTA. I don't believe you're doing this for selfish reasons, it's pretty clear that you want to see her stop getting hurt. I also have complex PTSD and I've got some pretty bad horror stories from my childhood. My father is a sociopath and has singlehandedly abused me, my mother, and my brother to the point which neither of them are living healthy lives to this day. I used to hate him for what he did to me but as I began to work through my shit I wanted to fix the relationship and finally have a father. I think there's a natural cadence to life that goes like this. Grow up dependent on your parents and showing them unconditional love (which you have no choice of), ultimately at some point you will renounce your parents and learn to hate them, (in most healthy people this occurs in the teenage years), and then as you mature and develop a wealth of positive experience you reach a level of self-actualization that shows you life is a gift and it deserves to be cherished. This mindset ultimately leads to the rekindling of unconditional love for your parents. This process tends to distort and slow with people having experienced trauma but I believe that desire is always there and it is a fundamental aspect to fulfillment in life. Your girlfriend is getting the help she needs that's a great start and she's got a ways to go but ultimately the goal of all therapy is self actualization and this will culminate in a desire to make right with her family despite everything they've done to her. 

You're doing the right thing by getting her out of that place to get her in a better healthy functioning state but to convince her that there is no value in a relationship with her parents or family is always a mistake. I've seen it happen many times in my own life and it always has ended up failing and damaging the relationship more than necessary. I know some people are so traumatized that they spend the entirety of their lives viewing life as a burden cursing their parents and in the worst cases cursing their own children by refusing to procreate but I would never encourage someone to this outlook. It's hell in every sense of the word. 

What I'm saying is don't encourage her to make a decision you can't undo. Don't create animosity and hardship that you cannot undo and then distill resentment. Best of luck to you and your girlfriend."

Bad people don't regret hurting other people.

But the symptoms you described in the comment before this were hypervigilance and some working memory errors. Hypervigilance can be caused by anxiety but it can also be caused by schizophrenia and more commonly caused by stress.

Pregabalin should work and if it doesn't I would say you're taking too little or it might not be anxiety. Pregabalin seems to be an all around great medication how much are you taking?

Most of the anti-anxiety medications work in a very similar way so if you've tried one and it didn't work there's not a ton of value in switching to a different one to see if it works like anti-psychotic medications. Other muscle relaxants might work better because they directly effect the central nervous system where as from what I understand prgabalin does not. The only thing that I think would make a significant difference would be a benzodiazepine but I highly advise against taking these medications. They're incredibly fast acting, they build a tolerance quickly, and they're addictive. Not to mention combine it with alcohol and it will kill you."

schizoaffective,fiqk3vw,t1_fiqj9fo,1582646011.0,"You are simply just misreading the text, I believe intentionally, to prove a point albeit invalid. Schizophreniform, schizoaffective, schizophrenia and delusional disorders are all individual disorders with the commonality of psychosis. They are called psychotic disorders for a reason. They are not called schizophrenia disorders. You absolutely do have to experience psychosis to be schizophrenic. And they are saying cognitive functionality disorder is a big part of the life of a schizophrenic. But the reason why they called them ""core symptoms"" is because they're core to the disorder they occur in every single case of schizophrenia and the extra symptoms are accessory to the core symptoms. Please don't bother me with this any further I have no interest in arguing with someone who doesn't want to actually learn something."
schizoaffective,fiqdhl1,t1_fipz056,1582641813.0,Again schizophrenia is not a spectrum psychosis is a spectrum. You have not in the slightest bit addressed my argument and there is not a single thing you said that is remotely true or factual.
schizoaffective,fioz1ba,t1_fiok86c,1582594313.0,"A good majority of psychologists agree that the DSM is flat out wrong. The DSM is made specifically for insurance companies to determine what they will cover and what they will not cover. That's it. There's no justification process for determining the diagnosis of a patient and the DSM certainly doesn't mitigate that.

Mental illness is so much more complex than a set of diagnostic criteria and diagnoses such as schizophrenia/schizoaffective should typically be avoided save for specialized mental health professionals. Also if someone is diagnosed with a big diagnosis as such it should be their first reaction to get a second opinion from a specialist. Why would you want any lower level of care?

Schizophrenia is not a spectrum, that is untrue. Psychosis covers a wide spectrum but schizophrenia does not. Psychosis occurs in 30% of the population schizophrenia occurs in 1% of the population and schizoaffective 1/10th of that. Schizophrenia is the most severe presentation of psychosis. It is characterized by hearing voices (almost always aggressive and beligerant if you live in a developed country), delusions that often consume the person, unusual thought/speech patterns. It can also be accompanied by paranoia, catatonia, and severe disorganization. These were considered subtypes as the were accessory to the primary symptoms of hearing voices, delusions and unusual thought/speech patterns. Schizophrenia is a very specific condition and while it can't be diagnosed with brain scans MRI's of people with schizophrenia are usually quite consistent.

Any psychologist worth his salt would tell you this. And unfortunately there are a lot of people in this forum who have been lead astray by professionals who wouldn't know better because they lack the experience to determine between psychosis and schizophrenia as the DSM lists them as being quite literally the exact same criteria. There are people in this forum who are diagnosed with schizoaffective who have never had a psychotic episode. If they're being treated in a manner than is helpful for them honestly good for them. But that does not change the fact that they're not schizoaffective."
schizoaffective,fiovf36,t1_fiokej1,1582591905.0,I'll reply to this on your comment because you kind of laid it out for me and it will be easier for me to arrange my thoughts as a rebuttal than as an individual set of ideas.
schizoaffective,fio1v92,t3_f8r5ro,1582574671.0,"So to be entirely honest there are a lot of people here who are diagnosed with schizoaffective who actually don't have schizoaffective. Sure by the DSM they might meet the criteria for schizoaffective but they're very clearly experiencing different things than people who have the more classic symptoms of schizophrenia. I'm not saying you are one of these cases and I have never once called out other people on this sub for this either. The fact of the matter is if people are seeing relief to their symptoms under this specific diagnostic criterion than they are unlikely to seek a change in diagnosis. For these people and I can say that I am one of them, they were diagnosed with schizoaffective by someone who strictly follows the DSM but is not well versed in the nuanced presentation of schizophrenia or psychotic symptoms. They likely received treatment that for them was probably life changing, no doubt. Then when someone says, ""well, you're not actually schizophrenic"" they get defensive and justifiably so. Why would you want to turn away from a treatment that helped you through probably one of the hardest times of your life and abandon all progress you've made? You wouldn't. But just because someone says you're not schizophrenic doesn't mean the treatment stops. What I am saying is that there are a lot of people here who have already been in your shoes or will be in the next few years of their lives and I'm saying just listen to what your therapist has to say. Give it an honest effort. And if it doesn't fit what you're looking for just switch therapists. There's no harm in gaining a new perspective. Nothing major has to change unless you say so."

I told my therapist about my drug use (psychedelics) one time and he never condemned the behavior but when I repeatedly kept coming back saying I had used them he just always had a look of intense dissappointment and I hated dissapointing him so I stopped.

I don't tell my primary doctor shit because he's not a nice guy and he's pretty bad at his job. What I talk about with my therapist stays with my therapist. I actually wouldn't even mind if my medical team knew what I talked about with my therapist because I'm an open book but I will only tell them if they ask. Typically they don't really care what's actually going on with me, so they don't ask, so I don't tell them.

Obviously the comedown is likely to be accompanied by depression and depending on the dose can increase thoughts of suicide. If you're taking an SSRI it will kill you.

Spiritual or not no one should have to suffer in their own mind. My therapist is a spiritualist and for the longest time was opposed to medication because he thought it would dull those spiritual experiences in my life. I agreed with him until I started to suffer.

Not sure why they would put schizoaffective NOS because that's a contradiction. Basically if it were to say psychotic disorder NOS it would mean they recognize you're psychotic but don't have enough information to pinpoint which disorder best fits or they don't want to put a name on it yet. It just means that they can't decide on a specific diagnosis yet but the fact that they chose schizoaffective means that they did decide so im not sure where the NOS comes from.
schizoaffective,fhneove,t1_fhnbmym,1581725771.0,Thank you. I am very familiar with dissociation as I have PTSD but avolition is exactly how I would describe it. I knew it wasn't catatonia as I was still somewhat connected to my surroundings where if someone was talking to me I would interact with them just didn't know the word for it.
schizophrenia,fhn03wd,t1_fhmybea,1581720206.0,Exactly. The way I see it is there's a whole hell of a lot worse ways of dealing with it so I'm doing pretty good. Most people my age (24) aren't drug free. There's a lot of people on way worse shit  or they are a whole lot worse off by choice. I need to forgive myself for choosing to be healthy and doing what's best for me.
schizophrenia,fhmwmr9,t3_f3zctf,1581719001.0,I still very much think of myself a failure for returning back to medication. So I appreciate this message. I know how bad medication can be for the body but honestly there are times when I still absolutely need it and without it I likely wouldn't be here.
schizophrenia,fhm9iud,t1_fhm5b18,1581709987.0,I'm just adding on to what the other person said. The research is pretty clear that treatment of first episode psychosis (no matter the diagnosis) is a huge predictor of the amount of damage these conditions do long-term. Often times lower income individuals are less likely to seek out treatment early enough to halt the progression into full on schizophrenia and also are more likely to have more severe cases of schizophrenia. Psychotic illnesses are degenerative but can be successfully cured or managed when treatment starts early on.
schizophrenia,fhm7pt1,t3_f3w2oh,1581709355.0,I laugh at a lot of pretty awful things and say a lot of pretty awful things that I often regret. For example when someone at work had messed up pretty big time and they were beating themselves up for it I laughed pretty hard at that and I knew it wasn't funny but I couldn't stop laughing. I laugh when people yell at me. The other day I accidentally told someone to stop breathing and then when I realized what I said I thought it was hilarious.
schizoaffective,fhm6jz6,t3_f3ukt4,1581709011.0,"Hi, I was curious if you could explain more about the ""staring at the wall"" part of your post. Is there a name for this, why does it happen and should I be worried about it kind of thing? I get that too and I don't really quite know a whole lot about it but it just started happening recently. Also sending good vibes your way I know external stress can be a huge factor on symptoms hope you're doing alright."
schizoaffective,fhlmlo0,t1_fhkn6hy,1581702285.0,It's apparent the only viewpoint that matters to you is your own so I will not waste my time arguing with you. Have a good day.
spirituality,fhg39vw,t1_fhfksiv,1581557590.0,I understand but you have to understand how powerful the mind is.

schizoaffective,fhcfaf1,t1_fhbyskk,1581461989.0,I have met plenty of people who can take a 10 strip and still go to work. You're welcome to disagree however it is a matter of mindset. LSD is a drug and it still is perfectly capable of being abused.
schizoaffective,fh9dioj,t1_fh9c4yk,1581378769.0,"Does ziprasidone have a similar side effect profile to risperidone? The reason why she chose to maintain Seroquel instead of switching to risperidone in our initial meeting was because of the effects on sleep and the effects on prolactin levels. Ziprasidone is also too expensive for me but if she will consider it over Seroquel I might just have to find a way to afford it.

 I doubt first gen anti-psychotic medications will be prescribed to me as I'm not schizoaffective but schizoaffective most closely matches my symptom profile. From what I understand first gen medications are reserved for last resort type situations.

Also I'm not sure if I would be considered in crisis. I'm not losing my mind that's for sure but I am severely depressed. Likely the most depressed I've been in my entire life."
schizoaffective,fh988f0,t1_fh97dnh,1581375323.0,"I'm looking at anti-psychotic medications with a higher affinity for 5-ht2a than for d2. These would be medications like abilify, or risperidone. I've tried abilify, it works great the only problem is I can't afford it. So right now the medication I have my eyes on is risperidone however if my psychiatrist were to reccommend an anti-psychotic that I could afford with similar pharmacology I wouldn't be opposed. The only problem with this type of anti-psychotic is that it has typically no or very little sedative effect and therefore no therapeutic value for sleep, which I may need. I know she's going to show preference for the least amount of medication. But I think in a perfect scenario I would be taking risperidone, lamictal and an SSRI probably sertraline."
schizoaffective,fh6g2fd,t1_fh5xqa1,1581298494.0,Unfortunately I can't afford to schedule appointments like that or else I would've already gone back in and changed medications. My insurance literally doesn't cover anything until I reach my deductible which is $2700. But I'm glad to know that it's hopefully not something that's set in stone and maybe she will consider changing two medications if I tell her why I believe that is necessary.
schizoaffective,fh5dhvm,t1_fh5bfa7,1581287853.0,"I know why it's the common route to change one medication at a time but for me to get on the appropriate medication regimen at this rate it would probably take me 6 months. Because first thing she's gonna want to do is increase the dose of Seroquel which I don't want to do but I'm certain she'll suggest it. Then when that doesn't work she might increase it again. Then when that doesn't work we might finally try a new anti-psychotic and say that takes one or two tries to get right we're already at 4-5 months. Then finally after all of that I would get an anti-depressant. Id rather wait a month knowing that I'm on the right path and going to gradually start feeling better than wait 6 months through constant failures just to prove what I've known this whole time. 

I've had several bad experiences with doctors making terrible choices on my behalf so I have chosen to play an active role in any treatment I get. I read up on all of the medications and make informed decisions about everything I do. I realize this isn't the norm in treatment but I absolutely know what is best for me and what isn't. I can't waste time with a doctor who isn't going to trust me to make decisions about my own health."
schizoaffective,fgzkvoj,t3_f0toec,1581195121.0,"Hallucinogen is an incredibly broad term. Drugs that cause schizophrenic like experiences are not your typical hallucinogens like LSD or mushrooms but instead are a seperate class called deliriants. These drugs (like salvia, datura, benadryl etc.) are not common and in fact most of the trips people have with these substances are not only negative but they're terrifying. Hallucinogens like LSD or magic mushrooms are commonly referred to as entheogens or just regular psychedelics and they typically produce mystical happy and powerful life-changing trips that are unlike schizophrenia in every way."
schizoaffective,fgzjxqy,t1_fgyyqxm,1581194809.0,It doesn't have to though there are plenty of people who abuse it for shallow experiences that have no depth or effect on their life or existence. Unfortunately.
schizoaffective,fgzhfhy,t1_fgy44jk,1581194184.0,Oh thank God. I felt so bad for a minute thinking I convinced you to go to the ER for no reason. I'm glad everything is okay though and everything came back normal. Yeah Seroquel had a pretty nasty record of causing diabetes and I know there are some people here who have seen that first hand. You can never be too careful when it comes to potentially life threatening stuff like that.
schizoaffective,fgxmty1,t1_fgxkr46,1581174463.0,I'm sorry. I was trying to emphasize that it was urgent but not emergency room urgent. But it's definitely not a weird reaction it's a quite common reaction to Seroquel one that usually ends up in long term diabetes if left untreated. Again I apologize.
schizoaffective,fgtk8sa,t1_fgthxx3,1581105602.0,Hmm. When I first experienced my manic episodes this is almost exactly how I would spend my nights. I would lie in bed with my eyes closed and feel like I was sleeping but I would be totally conscious and awake mentally. In my experience I was still sleeping but I couldn't let go of consciousness so I spent several days conscious despite my body somewhat sleeping. I'm not sure if medication could cause that specific type of sleepiness but I don't see why not. From the sound of it you are very much sleeping despite being conscious. Sleep and consciousness are not mutually exclusive. You can be conscious and be sleeping you can be unconscious and be awake but the default is usually conscious awake unconscious asleep. You see deviations in cases of narcolepsy or insomnia usually. Maybe ask your doctor about it see what they say.
schizoaffective,fgtj78p,t1_fgteo30,1581105197.0,"Im sure your muscles/body are probably fatigued too right? If that is the case take like a tablespoon of baking soda and mix it into like 4oz of some flavored liquid (I usually use like fruit juice but I wouldn't reccommend that here because it will spike your blood sugar maybe try like some emergen-c if you have any or some 0 calorie drink like Gatorade zero or something idk) beware it's going to taste god awful but it will help reduce fatigue.

Like I said don't panic, diabetes can be managed perfectly well-enough with a good diet. Focus on non-processed starches as  your source of carbohydrates. Good foods to eat would be most whole grains including whole grain breads, pasta, cereal, etc. Avoiding things like white bread, processed starches, floury sauces, sugary drinks and snacks etc. ""Diet"" drinks also tend to spike blood sugar despite being 0 calories. Just look up a good list of foods for diabetics and follow that to be sure. I assume if you take away the medication your resting blood glucose should go down but if for any reason your doctor thinks that isn't the case ask about low-carb diets and intermittent fasting to help you get back on the right track. Both of those have tremendous amounts of data saying they reduce insulin resistance over time which is the cause of diabetes. 

Please keep me posted as to what your doctor says and everything. Best of luck."
schizoaffective,fgte8sn,t3_f0bsx0,1581103245.0,"You need to call your doctor like immediately also avoid any foods that will spike your blood sugar in the mean time. I would even reccommend a low carb diet (try to stick below 50-80g of carbs a day). Your body is in a state called diabetic ketoacidosis because it can't break down the sugar you're putting in it causing your blood sugar to be too high at all times. Your body is telling you to drink water to try and even out the amount of sugar in your blood by diluting it with water. This is very serious and left untreated could kill you. Seroquel is known to cause this and your doctor probably should've checked your resting glucose before putting you on a medication known to cause diabetes. Call them, they should have more information about what to do I'm not a doctor so they might reccommend some specific regimen to make sure your blood sugar doesn't crash. Don't panic. This doesn't mean you're now permanently diabetic but you do need to seek treatment quite quickly I would say within the next couple days."
schizoaffective,fgtctkh,t3_f06p20,1581102730.0,Yes trazodone is very sedating and could definitely be the cause of it especially if you're taking it in the morning. It's usually prescribed for night time so I would be surprised if you took it in the morning but Ill mention it nonetheless. Also do you actually go to sleep for an hour or two or is it just like a sleepy haze where you're awake? This will help give better advice about what to do. You could not be sleeping enough and your body is forcibly finding sleep when it can through microsleep. Could be medication. Could be dissociation but dissociation and sleep are very much connected as dissociation is simply the brain going into a lower cognitive state by lowering brain waves the exact same way as sleep is.
schizophrenia,fgq1t8d,t3_ezkgxy,1581016260.0,I know you probably think you're funny but you're not. I reported the post too.
awakened,fgnm646,t1_fgn5806,1580947854.0,"I don't think you're being fair to OP. They weren't even remotely suggesting that your delusions were real. I'm PTSD with psychotic episodes so I understand where you're coming from but I think both of you are right. The OP is right because your hallucinations, delusions, are all apart of your very real world but not a part of the shared reality. And you're right because it's not safe to believe that a delusion or hallucination is real. The difference between say a shaman type person and a schizophrenic is simply the ability to turn it off and distinguish what is shared reality and what is not. Psychosis by definition is the inability to distinguish your reality from other realities. I don't think OP was trying to diminish yours or anyone's experience with psychosis or psychotic disorders but instead they were asking if hallucinating is actually a window into somewhere else like other dimensions or other world's. You have to remember that when otherwise unaware people hear schizophrenia they understand it to mean seeing and hearing things that aren't there."
schizoaffective,fgk8x5u,t1_fgfyrl4,1580860042.0,"I did that today. He continued to iterate that it is not delusional. He says I have a ton of redeeming qualities that anyone would be able to pick up on and appreciate. He said I'm a good guy, I am well put-together, intelligent, likeable and all kinds of things."
schizoaffective,fghopb2,t3_eyfbpo,1580789759.0,I'm bored 24/7 how am I the only one.
schizoaffective,fgg3s1s,t3_ey4ids,1580753624.0,Haloperidol is a particularly strong and sort of last case scenario anti-psychotic. Trazodone is an anti-depressant that also is a great sleep aid. It seems like you've done a bit of research on these medications so I'm sure you know this. If this is your first psychotic episode that might be why they're being cautious about the SZA label. If you believe you are schizoaffective because you have hallucinations outside of a mood episode than continue to inform them that you're hallucinating at all times rather than in an episode and it shouldn't be too difficult to be diagnosed as such. Like others said the medication is the same for both diagnoses and as long as you're getting the treatment you need the diagnosis doesn't matter.
schizoaffective,fgfefv0,t1_fgdvv3m,1580736291.0,I'm really not sure why my reply to this is being downvoted. I'm sharing my honest experience.
schizoaffective,fge1tes,t1_fgdyu52,1580689588.0,I think self esteem is the only thing that is keeping me grounded in this situation. Idolize is exactly what I mean. Any time I go on a date with someone the person quickly becomes obsessed with me talking about how I'm this perfect person and the person they've been looking for their whole life. Coworkers go out of their way to talk with me. People hit on me at work all the time. Compliment me needlessly. Self esteem is the only reason I know this is disordered thinking of else I would just ignore it.
schizoaffective,fge10yk,t1_fgdvv3m,1580689315.0,"Narcissistic? Absolutely, but that doesn't make me believe it any less. I truly believe that others are utterly infatuated with me. I believe that most of my co-workers hit on me (I'm 5'10"" 280lbs by no means am I conventionally attractive). People compliment me needlessly about all kinds of things. Sure I'll concede he was in a good mood and just wanted to share it but he specifically chose to talk to me and high five me. I'm in a completely different department he went out of his way."
