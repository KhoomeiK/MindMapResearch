I‚Äôm a heroin addict in recovery myself a little over a year clean so I know first hand the bullshit and living hell we put our loved ones through and no one is obligated to put up with it. I wish you luck this is a shit situation I hope things get better for you and your kids very soon."
relationship_advice,fdct37b,t1_fdcsqkq,1578283539.0,That is an amazing idea! I‚Äôm definitely doing that because I am just so overwhelmed and worn down from the situation. Your words give me hope though that it is possible to come out the other side. Thank you so much for your advice it was sorely needed today =]
relationship_advice,fdcrc1x,t1_fdc2uxx,1578282131.0,"You just described what I am going through with my dad currently. Thank you so so much for putting this into such concise words, this has helped me so much. I‚Äôm so glad you got away from that relationship!"
opiates,fdb1yah,t1_fckwu6r,1578252799.0,I'm horrible at checking my replies I'm sorry it took so long! I'm in the US it's not covered by insurance here yet but im hoping in the next few years they won't be able to deny the benefits of the ketamine infusion. I swear it's helped me stay away from going back to heroin. I had six treatments in two weeks and now im getting ready to go back in but it's a lot of money out of pocket so I'm just trying to save up. For me it's been worth the money though.  My Subutex doesn't do much for my back pain and after the first ketamine treatment I had relief from my stupid back pain. It also has helped my anxiety and depression to be manageable with out having to take my anxiety medicine which was so nice to be able to cut out.  I'm sorry I'm not great at explaining lol but if you have any questions please feel free to ask I want to help other people who are going through the same thing I have! I hope you're doing okay today friend!
opiates,fdb0nl7,t3_ekfufh,1578252366.0,That shit grabs a hold of us like a vice grips. I'm so sorry for your loss. Stay strong my friend. Try to remember the good times today.
opiates,fc5x8y7,t1_fc504wa,1577467811.0,"I'm a year clean off an almost decade of opiate abuse that ended with the last 2 and 1/2 years of IV heroin use. After kicking it nov 2018, the pain from depression and my physical pain from my back injury was no longer bearable and I went and got six sessions of the ketamine infusion therapy. Holy shit the past six months have been almost entirely pain free and I'm ready for another round. I'm so grateful I have it as the option bc it's not covered by insurance and is very expensive but greatly improved my quality of life."
trashy,fc5h7wt,t1_fc58kws,1577457513.0,"Wow, this really shook me. I have bipolar where I have issues with manic episodes and was on lithium for years. It damaged my speaking and short term memory severely. I'm only 29 and I'm also an RN and I know my stuff I'm a great at my job but the medical stuff is second nature. I really have trouble finishing sentences, I immediately forget what people have just said, I really struggle to even remember what I was just saying.  Along with horrible vocabulary recall. Also issues with forgetting huge parts of the previous day  I've worked so hard in school and my area of focus is neurology so it's ironic I find myself upset to tears bc of the damage the lithium poisoning caused.  I feel so stupid all of the time now. I feel for you an your mom. 
E: I'm taking welbutrin for the ADHD and the issues from the lithium poisoning. The welbutrin is a lifesaver.  honestly remembering if I took it or not every day that's a pain in my ass, but Im lucky my husband helps me remember."

relationship_advice,fc5em5a,t3_eg3q65,1577455306.0,"They're a bunch of assholes. Why TF would he show you???? You're not being over sensitive, I'd feel the same way but you seem nicer than I am, I would be very angry lol"
AbsoluteUnits,fbrdh2o,t1_fbnvizs,1577041808.0,"I have been doing the exact same thing the past week. Too overwhelmed and depressed to even put forth the effort of taking my welbutrin. I'm going to go take it now. Best of luck to you, we can do this!"
opiates,fbeurxo,t1_fb9c369,1576794434.0,Hey friend congrats on 2.5 months getting to that point is not easy!
relationship_advice,fanrov2,t1_famid31,1576248981.0,Will you lmk too I wanna help fund getting her out of there. Thank you
relationship_advice,fa1wpzk,t1_fa1ljod,1575775188.0,Of course it goes for men as well but OP is a teenage girl.
relationship_advice,fa1unft,t3_e7l2w7,1575774509.0,"My God I am so so sorry you are being put through this. First of all you did nothing wrong. Nothing. Youre not weak either. Quite the opposite, you reached out for help and when you were not satisfied you kept reaching out. You should be so proud of yourself. That is true bravery. Second of all, please notify the police. You're in danger and so is you're little sister. You both deserve a place to lay your heads safely at night. If you need any help finding resources please send me a message.  I'm just an internet friend but I'm also an RN and am here if you need anyone to talk to. Good luck my friend you are strong enough to get through this!


E: as someone else mentioned going to the police is definitely intimidating so if you feel more comfortable speaking with a teacher or counselor please go to one they will help you go through the proper channels. Best of luck"
OurPresident,f9urvjh,t3_e6z9pa,1575656591.0,Couldn't afford my mental health/substance abuse treatment last year (with insurance $120 copay a visit). Resulted in me trying and failing to stay sober by myself and relapsed for a year with two ODs. Paying out of pocket for counseling and meds now and have been sober over a year thank God. Worst experience ever.
politics,f7loje0,t3_dwtkmy,1573844950.0,These people are so insufferable. It‚Äôs painful to watch them say the same irrelevant shit over and over. Give it a rest you unstable useless lunatics.
