I wonder if there are folks who have the time and energies to be involved, even if they want to be?  I don't know.

I wonder if this is illustrating our human tendency to feel we must group together to do anything that might draw attention or criticism?

I have, myself, been doing 'absurd activities' alone for a few years.  Yes, courage has been needed, but I know for a fact that I have moved mountains at times in social behaviours and human activities, by doing those things.

What did I do (and still do)?

I dress in an inconsistently discordant fashion, which can't be pinned down  to any usual genre or grouping.

I dance in the open with or without music, freely, including in festivals  in front of big crowds.

I sing similarly. Yes, I consider that I may be making a fool of self, but I love to sing at times and, I think, tomorrow I may have no voice, so not a moment to lose!    Same with dance (or anything else, in fact).

I speak out and write about taboos.  This can often be bordering on what could be perceived as absurdity, given the insanity of that which I speak.

I stand on the roadside alone with placards and flag, in solidarity for the animals and for Earthlife.   The placards are usually hard-hitting or criptic, and I dress as rebel for the occasion.

I do clown around a little bit at times and make laughter at my own expense. ,  try to do a 'party' online (as you know) and play at being  'DJ' even though I have little clue how to make it all happen.    And more.

I tell you,  if little old me can do all this, alone, then what amazing possibilities must everyone else have?

overpopulation,fptgzop,t1_fpt6u7p,1588891076.0,"&#x200B;

To try to give it to you here in a nutshell:

Fear of death drives desire for survival at all costs, which causes human greed for life and for resources, ending with the destruction of life.

Science shows us how all existence is 'totally interconnected', thus all existence always exists, never fully dies, and so life and death exist in co-operation.

When we die in one form, we continue in another, physically, and, due to the influence and impact we have in life, our 'essence' (emotions, psyches, intellects, personalities etc, )  continue to exist in memory and as part  of the fabric of life.

For all who fear death, this provides reassurance and comfort about the death of our body, our being, as it is not an end, but just a continuation.

At the same time,  we know, pragmatically, that the body has ended , sentience has thus ended, as also consciousness, and so there is no longer any possibility of pain or of suffering.

This also is a realisation of reassurance.  There is relief in knowing of this release from the sufferings of life (or the potential sufferings).  The absence of pain and suffering is peace.   We rightly say 'Rest in Peace'.

It is obvious that such reassurances are needed in the current Earth Crisis and virus situation.   I work to bring this reassurance to those who need it.

With such reassurance we are able to accept death, rather than fear it.   We no longer need to try to avoid it when nature calls us to death.

The implications of accepting death are as wide as the world of human life:   Basically,  all the billions of ways that we have made machines, substances, materials, technologies, industries....using up all Earth's resources...causing all the extreme suffering .....can all be abandoned.

We can then live simply, respectful of Earth, with compassion as our central value.

We can then use the wisdoms hopefully not yet lost, of natural remedies, pain alleviations and aneasthetics, etc (for helping to die, when needed),  to put compassion into action.

We can live in community, locally, healthily, beautifully, harmoniously, as we all dream to do, in our heart of hearts.

I hope this helps."
xrmed,fpslu14,t1_fprglld,1588875650.0,"philosophically speaking, it is more sad, and more evil, to consciously and deliberately cause 'a lot of mice' a lot of suffering in the cause of that which does not even specifically benefit mice in the end, than that all life be dead, for death is peace with no more suffering."
overpopulation,fpsgl23,t1_fprnfkn,1588873117.0,"Congrats on the sterilisation.  And I like you optimism, though I do feel it is a losing battle.

One point:   industrialisation is ALL about avoiding death.....

Our fear of death drives desire for survival at all costs, which causes the destructive greed for resources.

We are preventing death as a large part of the work of this 'civilisation', all the time, and the massive medical machinery is a large part of that.  In fact, in the efforts to prevent death, we actually cause more suffering.

Total interconnection of all existence, as science explains in quantum mechanics, allows the alteration of the paradigm from fear to acceptance.

Regarding the virus being a strategy:  this can be so without necessitating a conscious mind, thus, Earth can have a strategy, and the virus is one of them, in her efforts to stop humans in their tracks of destroying everything.

 Lastly, 'Natural' has no need to be 'good' or 'evil', and is not so, as it does not have the consciousness to decide between the two.   

Yes, animals kill, in nature, and so on, but the suffering is minimal compared to what we cause to  domesticated animals.  

Also, all documentaries about the wild are skewed in favour of getting an audience, and so use sensationalism and other methods, thus not giving the true picture of the wild.  Nature is foremost about compassion, not cruelty, aggression and so on.   All documentaries are made with the interference of humans in the environment of those beings which they film, thus altering the behaviours of those beings to behaviours which they do not do naturally.

I have mentioned this type of activism many times online.  I call it 'standing local'.  It costs nothing, has no carbon footprint, needs little time, had massive impact. 

What's not to like?   I know.......people are not brave enough to do it, that's what."
xrmed,fpljsso,t3_ge4kb0,1588713980.0,"I feel there is a danger of being too thorough and logical  (alien cortex!). Bare bones needed?....

500lonewolves,  

plus (millions of ) lone activists on roadsides, beamng the message to power,  via medias,   

plus small capable, professional, intelligent, informed, assertive teams hone in on big corps, govs and elites, with persuasion undeniable.

Finally, a core group targeting an 'evolution of faith', to cause  an alteration of attitude to death from fear to acceptance, without which no future sustainable life will be possible."

We may well have more in common than it seems.  I do have faith, in myself, and due to 'total interconnection' I , as with  everyone,  am 'God'.  'God' is All. All is 'God'."

But the deaths from suicide are not been reported, or from any other illnesses or injuries.

It is going to be very hard to regain our rights after this, but the virus will pass by, maybe come and go like the flu and colds.   

The virus is real, yes, and I hope it reduces the numbers of humans, but so far it is just a minuscule number."

Practically nobody in my part of the world is capitulating to the  fear-mongering. Not a mask in sight when I go out.  People are using their common sense.  Nobody knows anybody who has even got the virus, let alone died from it.  We are believing our own direct observations, not the lying governments."

I have whittled down my own message to 'acceptance of death' .    People have such short-phrase capacity.   Perhaps I would say 'For life, we need to accept death', or similar.  'For life, accept death.'....etc etc."
xrmed,fp5g87v,t1_fp55cjd,1588328234.0,"hmmm......the thoughts that occur to you about death practices in religious traditions, I feel they kinda show why we need a new paradigm about death.

In my philosophy, there is no need for disrespect for the dead, or about death, or any feelings of horror, and no need for cannibalism for sure."

xrmed,fp4cf8d,t3_gat1bu,1588296087.0,"yes, and 'loyalty' to the natural world entails accepting death as a full partner with life and thus ceasing to fear death.

the fear of death is the driver of human greed for resources and survival at all costs.

science proves all existence is totally interconnected, thus neither life nor death are absolute, our existence therefore never ceases to exist, and we are all one.  

the awareness of these truths brings peace and comfort..    So no need for fear, no greed, no destruction of life."

When I see **individuals everywhere** out there on their own local highways with their placards standing in solidarity for the innocent animals, the crippled Earth...... sending their action, by social medias,  to corporations, governments and 'elites',  then I will start to be impressed....and a little hopeful."

I keep reminding XR and anyone else, that we are all still free to go out on our own streets to protest as individuals, seen and heard by our locals and passing traffics, with our placards or voices......but does any one person ever get off their back-side to do this?  

There are NO brave, not really courageous people, it seems. 

 It takes real grit to go out there and stand for what is right....independently,..... and keep faith that others will also do so, until millions are out there showing solidarity for justice in all its forms, and especially for the suffering animals and the devastated Earth."
