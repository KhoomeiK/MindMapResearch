EatingDisorders,fqdkehk,t3_gi52s0,1589291519.0,"I definitely experience this too. I get so frustrated when people come and ask for a bite or just take some of my food, and I feel so bad and greedy!! I think that this is a byproduct of former restriction and is just a way for you and your body to make sure it is going to get the nutrition it needs because you have gone through a period of starvation before (i still feel this way and i am no longer restrictive). I think that learning to share just takes time as you become more relaxed around eating?? Idk yet tho haha."
EatingDisorders,fpaw3tu,t3_gccmpi,1588456930.0,I get you so much. The answer is yes definitely yes. I consider myself highly self aware and I was diagnosed with and eating disorder a while ago. Just because you know what is happening to you does not mean it is not happening. Yes its a great thing to know you have disordered thinking and habits but just knowing that you have a problem does not mean you do not have the problem. I hope this makes sense lol. Sometimes I feel like I am able to talk myself out of thinking I have an issue when in retrospect I definitely did. The further along you stride in recovery the better you are able to asses your past patterns and thoughts. Best of luck to you!
bulimia,fjlqo7t,t1_fjlj33w,1583452252.0,omg this is my favorite quote of all time i think about it 4 times a day
bulimia,fj5v2h4,t1_fj5usfe,1583044179.0,np!! also supplements help me a lot too bc they don’t really have calories but they are still giving you the vitamins you need
bulimia,fj5uqei,t3_fbojb1,1583043826.0,this one hit home. i hate being the friend that is known for vomiting when we drink.
bulimia,fj5unug,t3_fbpz85,1583043753.0,eating regular meals is definitely better than starving yourself but it’s not just the lack of nutrition that throws off your potassium and calcium and things like that. Try eating some bananas or drink some orange juice during the day to help with that stuff. The best thing for your body would be to stop purging but ik ik if it were that easy we wouldn’t be here. Good luck at your appointments btw!!

bulimia,feowkzt,t3_eq32re,1579306960.0,Do you still think about food all the time? Like do you still struggle with food decisions and things like that? It just seems so foreign to me to not have food be one of the biggest parts of your life.
