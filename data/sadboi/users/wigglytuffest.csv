EatingDisorders,f6pmaqc,t3_dsekwq,1573059482.0,"Well... in my opinion, normal eating is not being scared of food or full meals. When recovering from an eating disorder, it is challenging to get to that phase because the purpose of an ED is to fear food and full meals. 

What my therapist taught me was to eat mechanically as a method of relearning how to eat. Eating mechanically is eating 3 **FULL** meals, 2-3 snacks that consist of two items (apple & yogurt for example), and a dessert/treat if I want, all in a day. When eating your food throughout the day you should never go longer than 4 hours without eating. 

When she told me this I just about died. That was way too much food for what I wanted to consume. She reframed food as medicine for me, if you want to get better, you need to take medicine. 

To help make sure I didn't cheat or compromise my progress she recommended this phone app [Recovery Record](https://www.recoveryrecord.com/). It helps remind you when to eat, allows you to journal how you felt when you eat, and if you experienced any symptoms for that meal (restrict, purge, etc.) It gives you a moment of reflection to notice certain patterns that could trigger any symptoms."
EatingDisorders,f4u2lh8,t3_dls2lg,1571797544.0,"Partners are confusing because they can be equally enabling and supportive. I had a similar situation with my partner where I was hyper focused on what they were eating. I would often feel embarrassed and intense shame if I ate more, or I would use them as a clock for when I should eat - if they weren’t hungry the ED in me was so happy because I could restrict with it being okay, and then on the flip side if they were wanting to binge I could shamelessly partake.

What’s helped for me is rigorous meal planning. My therapist talks about food being medicine for eating disorders. This takes the form of planning 3 meals of proper sizes, 2-3 snacks a day, all eaten at regular intervals of no longer than 4 hours apart. This planning I found gave me the same permission that I found when I tried eating around my boyfriends body cues. Also, viewing the prepped meals as medicine makes me less obsessed with what he’s eating, because he doesn’t need medicine in the regular intervals as I do.

Also, having the meals prepped is easy and thoughtless. I don’t have to worry about measuring portions in comparison to my partner. 

I still struggle and relapse but having my meals prepped for easy access, and viewing them as medicine helps me a lot. As well helps my relationship with my partner, and food."

This is not an attack but an honest question... what does a surplus really mean to you? In my opinion, a surplus means money that is not being distributed amongst the province in a valuable way. For instance, the money is coming from cutbacks, but the tighter budget affects others that could use that money at the moment (I'm thinking specifically OSAP). If the government wants a surplus, how does that actually serve the province?"

AskReddit,ews89fk,t3_cpwua7,1565722202.0,"I would say incremental changes. Losing weight is about maintaining a certain lifestyle. It is \*not\* starving yourself/over-exercising and depleting your body of nutrition and then eventually binging on food / being too tired to exercise. If that's the mentality you have, you'll burn out quick and yo-yo forever. 

The first incremental change if you haven't already is don't drink your calories. Soda? That is garbage and will kill you in a million and one ways, get a soda stream or just drink water with lemon in it. Trust me, you'll eventually just crave water. 

Another way is to make eating mechanical through meal prep. Make sure to have 3 meals a day, and 2-3 snacks at the same time every day within whatever caloric limit you make of yourself. 

This is one change that 1) will ensure you are eating nourishing foods throughout the day 2) you are not restricting your food intake during the day which will help you not feel exhausted when you get home from work. Meal prep is your friend!"

veganrecipes,ewdpext,t1_ewdfr7x,1565304839.0,"Not OP but I'm currently recovering from an eating disorder, and the biggest thing my  therapist talks about is eating filling nutritious foods, which is what stops cravings of certain things that people lack (like omni's going vegan and complaining they crave ""protein"" but that's because they aren't eating a proper serving of protein substitute the meat they used to eat.)

Meals need to be balanced with a serving of carbs, protein, and fat. I think what's missing from some of the meals is protein and/or fat. For instance for breakfast the oatmeal could have hemp hearts or another seed to qualify as the fat, for lunch you could add avocado to the taco for a fat, and then for dinner, you can add lentils or TVP for protein and then a cashew cheese/cashew parmesan as a fat.  

It's all about fueling your body properly with full servings! Otherwise, people get bored and have low energy then complain that plant-based eating isn't how our bodies are supposed to eat, when in reality they are eating the wrong balance of food."

With that being said... I'm fairly certain that you may be out of luck with that deposit. Legally landlords can only take last months rent as a deposit when you rent out a unit (first months rent isn't even kosher according to the LTB but it's just how things have evolved in this rental market.) Any other deposits are considered not covered by the LTB :("
raisedbyborderlines,ew1cm9w,t3_cmbd8s,1565020446.0,"Hey! I take Lexapro and it has been day and night in terms of stabilizing my mood. I have a lot of anxiety surrounding worth and self-image after a life long battle of being told I wasn't good enough from my uBPD mom. I'm also prone to depressive episodes which is what prompted me to seek further treatment beyond psycho-therapy. 

I liken my experience of taking Lexapro to ""swimming"". It's like a life jacket that I wear. Pre-medication I would swim, something would grab my foot in the water, or I would get out of breath and I would just sink to the lowest of moods or intense anxiety. Lexapro helps my head stay afloat and prevents me from sinking so that I can use my self-care tool belt to help myself. 

I think the cool thing about medication is that you don't have to be on it forever, and it's not a death sentence. This is currently my third time taking anti-depressants for anxiety and depression in my life, with a couple of years in between treatments. Medication helps you to help yourself and treat yourself better. It doesn't magically cure anxiety and depression but it makes it A LOT more manageable."

xxfitness,etfft7t,t3_cbb2ug,1562768679.0,"I'm recovering from something similar (restrictive/purging ED).  At the beginning of recovery, I felt like I would never ever feel like I could eat like a normal person again.

I always found it hard to evaluate ""how much is enough of x carbs and x protein"" when it came to my fitness goals while *also* building up healthy eating habits. ""Fitness eating"" and ""Healthy eating"" always seemed to be at odds with each other and that was all my mind could focus on.

I'm currently seeing a therapist who specializes in helping people recover from EDs and disordered eating. I am on a meal plan of eating enough and eating frequently enough, and *wow* it is helping me loads.

3 meals a day, 3 snacks a day in the order: Breakfast, Morning Snack, Lunch, Afternoon Snack, Dinner, Evening Snack and if you want, Dessert. Each meal should consist of a \*full\* serving of carbs, protein, and fats. Seems simple enough, but it made me aware that I was always skimping on portions (like 1/3 of a cup of cooked quinoa, rather than a cup) to save on calories.

Also, no snack or meal should be more than 4 hours apart. This is huge but restrictive eaters because it retrains your body to learn that 1) you will feed it 2) nourishing yourself is okay.

Do not be afraid of full meals!! I promise it helps, and if you are still hungry, make sure your snacks are nourishing and filling. It will help with appetite, obsession with food, and although it seems like *\*a lot\** to eat, it's how normal people eat. I promise you it's not too much!!

Good luck and sending good food energy your way!!"
