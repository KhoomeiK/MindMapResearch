depression,evjjhvg,t3_cjzusc,1564563710.0,"Have a look around your surroundings...we live on this beautiful little planet. Look at the nature. You were put here for a reason. Only you have the power from letting your mind drift away into negative spaces. Think deeply about what is that makes you depressed, what can you do about it?
Meditate. The single best advice I can give right now.

You say you've tried everything but there are always other things out there. Indulging hobbies, welcoming communities, strangers who could be great friends. Have you seen the rest of the world? Wouldn't you like to? Try going on a trip, to a city or a country you have always wanted to. If money is an issue then try going for long drives around the country. Being by yourself isn't bad, it can help put things in perspective for you. Listen to music to give a voice to your anguish and a way to let it out. Scream at the top of your lungs somewhere you are by yourself. Seriously that helps a lot!

Try not taking things too seriously. You'll find love again. Do more of what you like.

You aren't alone. Your family and friends will miss you no matter what. They'd rather have you here than never get to see you again. Think about how hurt they would be if they could never see you again.

Hang in there, life is worth it. You're worth it.

Look at all of us trying to lend a helping hand here, we care. We know how hard this can get."

unpopularopinion,euidro7,t3_cgh9t8,1563845627.0,"Marvel movies simply suck ass now. Gone are the days when you could actually call this regurgitated content ""movies"" or ""films"". Now they are just uninspired action flicks which rely heavily on fan service and firework CGI finales, complete with idiotic one-liners. They are meant to be swallowed up by a pre-existing audience whose every demand and need is kept in-check for studios to make immense profits! Nothing more. 

Simply take a look at Avengers: Endgame. It's very convoluted, filled with plot holes, very weak storyline and bloody long to the point it's just exhausting. (It's a 1/10 for me) But hey does any of that matter? No. The fanboys are willing to overlook it all, and look at the result, it's the highest grossing movie of all time.ü§¢ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

They aren't meant to be great movies which draw in new groups of audience looking for films they will remember for a long time. These flicks are pastiches of their comic book source materials, sadly, that's what sells now. Every Marvel movie released is a slap to the art of film making in almost every aspect and a bane to the industry. All they want is to satisfy the audience of the current times with every trick they have up their sleeves. Look at this whole ""Diversity"" thing going on now.

https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49070232

Critics are mere puppets of studios at this point. For every single one who wonders ""Hey isn't it very convinient for them to be diverse after raking in huge profits from Black Panther?"" There are 100s praising them for it. 

It must be noted that Marvel isn't the only one to blame. They are just responding to what the public desires like every greedy corporation out there regardless of consequences. To them, they have got a winning formula and why would they let it go until it's out of fashion?"
