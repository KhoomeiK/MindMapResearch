teenagers,fazq8ob,t3_eapvgq,1576418550.0,"Sure, but you really gotta be careful with how you said that feminism doesn't mean women don't think they're better than men. I really appreciate people like you that believe in the equality of men and women rather than superiority of either, but the reason I try to disassociate with the word feminism is because there's many different types of it, one of which seems to be the most common in mainstream media (and I think you'd agree based on what you think of this toxic behaviour some women have):

Radical Feminism, and the goal of these radicals is to basically make men pay for what males have done in the past to make up for all the bad things that have been done to women in history. Not the people who were sexist, men today, normal people who are just living their lives, regardless if they're sexist or not towards women. We must all pay.

Coming from someone who doesn't see men as superior, someone who has no problem with women having equal rights, the word feminism is just too easy to be confused with the radicals of the community so I avoid it altogether. I'd say I'm a feminist, but it gets tiring having to specify what that means because nobody can agree what it means."

But personally I find you can get a lot of more varied tones from a Jazz configuration, not to mention it's preferred for slap playing if you want to delve into that.

That being said, nothing really compares to a Precision bass in a hard rock context, it's got a distinct tone recognizable in a lot of classic rock music.

So in that sense, it comes down to personal preference. I've always preferred the Jazz Bass because of how many genres I find myself in and how many different bassists I try to emulate. Basically, I find it easier to emulate a P bass with a J than to emulate a J bass with a P. Not sure if this is true of everybody, just what I notice by my ear."
