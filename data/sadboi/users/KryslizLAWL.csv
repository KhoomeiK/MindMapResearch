ASLinterpreters,f61j3wv,t3_dq9piv,1572641080.0,"Being a CODA does not qualify you to be able to sit for the NIC; you are required to have a bachelor‚Äôs degree. The major is completely up to you, however, an interpreter training program is recommended. Just because you are fluent in two or more languages does not prove that you are able to interpret them. 

I often use the analogy: ‚Äúeveryone drives a car, but that does not make everyone a mechanic.‚Äù"
AmItheAsshole,f5u9bsu,t1_f5t0vt5,1572470121.0,"Professional interpreter here! ^^yes, you‚Äôre absolutely right. 

One important thing to note is that the OP‚Äôs family should be requesting a English/Spanish interpreter, not a translator. Most people are unaware of this, but translation only applies to what we call ‚Äúfrozen texts‚Äù, which are essentially permanent documents (books, forms, info pamphlets, etc). Interpreters are what the general public knows as ‚Äútranslators‚Äù; they do live facilitation of two languages for two parties that do not speak the same language and or have the same culture. The distinction is crucial because a translator and an interpreter‚Äôs skill sets are quite different. Every interpreter can translate, but not every translator can interpret. Make sense?

I only make the distinction here because I‚Äôve seen the consequences of this confusion happen and it can be truly devastating for the parties involved; quite literally, life or death. 

OP, I hope your family can request an interpreter from now on, which would hopefully alleviate some of the responsibility your mom has to take on. Then, she may not put some of the leftover burden on you. 

Also, NTA."

ptsd,eyionr8,t3_cx2rb3,1567105293.0,This is something I‚Äôve dealt with more recently too. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD and I think downplaying our trauma is a way for us to survive.

The other issue that comes about with these gloves is that the gloves can not possibly take contextual information into account either. In ASL, for example,  the signs ‚Äúperfect‚Äù and ‚Äúasshole‚Äù are utilize the same handshape; can you imagine a pair of gloves misinterpreting something like that? Yikes. 

Undoubtedly, the inventor‚Äôs intent was good and the technology is incredible, but...no."

ASLinterpreters,eu4rii4,t3_ceocse,1563461525.0,"Professional interpreter here- learn ASL from Deaf people, period. There are often free classes in communities, weekly/monthly Deaf chats (typically a hub for local Deaf folks to meet and catch up), and college courses. It‚Äôs certainly worth noting that you cannot possibly learn cultural behaviors, norms, and traditions from an online program; the culture is equally as crucial to become familiar with if you‚Äôre going to immerse yourself in a different linguistic community. Though I‚Äôm not sure where you‚Äôre from, I would utilize Meetup.com and search for either ASL or Deaf groups in a city near you. Facebook may also be useful to you. Best of luck!"
