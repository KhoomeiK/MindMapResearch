Hyperhidrosis,ffz3amc,t3_evz8lt,1580362551.0,"It definitely helps for me. If I know it's going to be a problem, I take it about an hour before the sweat-inducing event, and it works like a charm. Like others said, it can be addictive, but I think as long as you're not taking it every single day, you'll be fine. Talk to your doctor though. Personally I've been taking it (not daily, just as needed) for years and have never had an issue. Just be careful with it."

Anxiety,ez37h7y,t3_czqtqt,1567662254.0,"Yup, definitely. Just yesterday I was really anxious and started having stomach pain and kept going to the toilet. Then it got even worse and I felt nauseous and started vomiting. It's not fun. :/"
Anxiety,ewpx5r0,t3_cph7b2,1565651449.0,"My first class of the semester is tonight. I'm pretty anxious but somehow reading ""you have a 100% survival rate"" helped. It is true... No matter how anxious I get tonight, I will survive, class will end and I'll get to go home. Good reminder. Thanks!

Update: I am home now. Can confirm I survived and it wasn't too bad."
Anxiety,ewpso2p,t1_ewp9oyi,1565648397.0,"I'm not OP but I don't think they'll care. I don't think you even have to tell them. They'll probably ask if you're going to school, but I mean... you don't have to say ""no, I got kicked out"". You can just say you're still going to high school if you want. They're not gonna look into it.

But even if they did know about it, again, they just want someone that can do the job. Granted, I don't live in the best area, but a lot of people working those positions where I live are former convicts who never finished high school. Really, for these entry level positions, it doesn't matter that much. You'll be fine :)"
Anxiety,ewpsbtk,t3_cpgbre,1565648171.0,"This post resonated with me a lot. I'm the same way. Recently had to look for jobs, but I've only had one job before so my resume was pretty short. And when I did submit applications, I was in a constant state of anxiety every day, anticipating a phone call that may or may not ever come. Waking up every few hours panicking. That shit sucks.

Here's my advice though, and what worked for me: try not to take it too seriously. If you bomb an interview, you know what's gonna happen? Nothing. The only thing you can do is try your best and see how it goes. Every interview you do is a learning experience, whether you get the job or not. And they expect you to be nervous, so don't even worry about that. Just listen to their questions, take a moment to reflect on it if you need to, and answer it as best as you can. They just want to see you putting in an effort.

Also, in my experience, most entry level positions (especially ones like McDonald's) aren't going to have a very grueling interview process. All of the interviews I've had so far have been very basic... most of the questions are basic ""get to know you"" kind of questions. Just try to seem enthusiastic and positive, and I'm sure you'll do okay. I see you mentioned you were kicked out of school, but I don't think you necessarily have to tell them about that. I don't know if you're planning to go back and finish high school or not, but if not, you could always just work on getting a GED. That's what I did, and it wasn't very difficult. It's essentially a high school diploma that you can acquire by taking a few tests, rather than having to finish high school. I'm not the best student, but I didn't even have to study for any of the tests... they were very simple, but even if you fail one, you can just re-take it. No biggy.

I know another poster mentioned volunteering and you said your parents won't let you, but if you go long enough without landing a job, maybe you can convince them by saying you need something to put on your resume. Volunteering can be very helpful not only for your resume, but also your confidence. I volunteered for a while before I got a job, and it helped a lot. Since you're not a paid employee there's no real pressure, and it helped me build up my confidence to the point where I felt like I could handle a job - volunteering is usually super chill. And I got to cuddle puppies all day, since I volunteered at an animal shelter :) Also sometimes volunteer positions can become real jobs... I wouldn't expect this to happen, but I saw several people I used to volunteer with become employees at the shelter. You just never know.

Another option is an unpaid internship. The ""unpaid"" part sucks, but you're essentially getting work experience, and they often hire you once the internship is over. I landed an unpaid internship one time by literally just emailing my local newspaper and telling them ""I'll be honest, I'm just a college student with no job experience whatsoever, but I think I'm decent at writing papers and was interested in any internships you might have available"" and attached a few of my essays from school. Believe it or not, that was good enough.

I would go ahead and do the McDonald's interview, even though it sounds like you don't want to work there. And you don't have to. I'd suggest just interviewing anyways, for the sake of getting interview experience. If you go and it's not as scary as you think it'll be, you might be less anxious next time you interview somewhere. If McDonald's offers you a job and you don't want it, just turn it down and apply somewhere else. Your parents don't have to know, it's your life.

Lastly - you can google interview questions for wherever you're applying, to get an idea of the kinds of questions they might ask.

I hope some of that was helpful, and I'm sorry you're feeling this way - I know the feeling all too well. But I promise you're gonna be fine."
Anxiety,es26gkl,t1_es1t2zj,1561515173.0,"I was thinking Hocus Pocus too! Glad I'm not the only one who still remembers that game haha. But those look great OP! I know how it feels to be really passionate about your art, but be too anxious to show it to anybody. I've dabbled in photography for years and have taken some shots I think are pretty decent, but I never show them to anybody other than immediate family members and things like that. It's hard - it feels like opening yourself up in a way, since art is basically an expression of one's self. And I'm usually too self conscious for that kinda thing.

So that's really awesome. Keep going!"
