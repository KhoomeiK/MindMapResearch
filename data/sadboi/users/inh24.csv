OSCAR THIS IS THE BEST FILMS
I HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST 20
YEARS FOR ME I CAN'T SPEAK FOR
OTHERS BUT FOR OTHERS I THINK
IT HAS MADE PEOPLE HAPPY AND
BELIEVE IN MOVIE MAKING AGAIN
THIS FILM TAUGHT ME TO BE KIND
TO PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS
BLACK WHITE GAY TRANSGENDER
WHATEVER BECAUSE LIKE AURTOR
SAID THE WORLD CAN'T BE CIVIL
TO EACH OTHER AND MENTAL
ILLNESS IS NOT YOUR FAULT I
HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF PSEUDOBULBAR DISORDER
AND NOT JUDGING PEOPLE AND
CALLING THEM CRAZY BECAUSE
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW THEY
WERE RAISED LIKE AURTOR HIS
CHIDHOOD WAS HORRIBLE HIS
MOTHER ALLOWED HIS ABUSE
TO ME THATS WORSE THAN THE
GUN HE HAD AND HE DID NOT
KILL JUST TO KILL HE KILLED THE
ONES THAT HURT HIM RIGHT OR
WRONG ITS FOR YOU TO DECIDE
BUT FOR ME SOME OF THEM
DESERVE IT ESPECIALLY THE
TRAIN SCENE HE TOOK A LOT OF
PUNCHES AND KICKS BEFORE
HE SHOT IT REALLY WAS SELF
DEFENSE IN TODAY'S JUSTICE
SYSTEM BUT IN 1981 IT WAS
NOT. SAME WITH THE KIDS THAT
JUMPED HIM HE DID NOT TAKE
THEM OUT WHEN HE VERY WELL
COULD HAVE. TO ME AUTHOR/
JOKER SHOWED EMPATHY MORE
THAN WHAT WAS SHOWN TO HIM
AND I ALSO GOT THAT PEOPLE
NEED LOVE AND RELATIONSHIPS
LIKE AURTOR LOVE SOPHIE
AND SHE UNDERSTOOD I HOPE
IN THE JOKER SEQUEL THEY
GET TOGETHER LOVE IS LOVE
REGARDLESS OF COLOR OR
MENTAL ILLNESS AND NO
BACKSTABBING EVEN PEOPLE
WITH MENTAL ISSUES LIKE
MURRAY DID TO AURTOR. ON TV
OF ALL PLACES MAKIN HIM THINK
HE HAD A FRIEND AND BAM LIKE
JOKER SAID JUST WANTED TO
MAKE FUN OF HIM WHY THIS
MOVIE MADE A BILLION PLUS
PEOPLE HAPPY THATS FOR THEIR

they don't even continue your medication. you have to organize everything yourself in only a couple of days

I remember being told about this the very day before my stay at the hospital ended and they expected me to take care of my medication supply since they weren't allowed to give medication to people who aren't patients at the hospital. they compromised on breaking the rules and giving me a supply for 3 days so I have some time to work with.

no seriously I'm having a hard time finding therapy and treatment. and this is coming from someone living in Germany of all places. sadly almost all treatment centers rely on antipsychotics for my case and those who don't are either too far away or literally don't care about people between 20 and 23 years old. 

I've actually had a therapist last year but exactly as I was about to get a fixed spot I had an episode, had to go to the hospital and when I came back they told me they didn't have a spot available anymore. 

 And now with the pandemic I don't have a lot of options anymore."
