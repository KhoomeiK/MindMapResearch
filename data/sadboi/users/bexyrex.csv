I feel bad because I peaked in terms of ""success"". in college. I was a premed student, 3.3 GPA at an Ivy League University. At one point I had the chance to do anything, be anyone. but i was too emotionally broken to handle it. So i spent those 4 years trying to put myself back together from the severe trauma of my childhood. it took SIX FUCKING YEARS TO PULL MY SHIT TOGETHER and somewhere in those 6 years i graduated college moved across the country and became partnered.

Now I'm finally back in track with the potential to really become somebody and I'm exhausted again. I don't even know if the ""success"" ladder is worth it anymore."

I chose him because of all the men i've dated he's one of the few who truly respected me as a fucking person and not a sex object. I also have no intention of having children so i'm not looking to ""up my race"" or whatever that bullshit is about. But you are right black women are shunned in the public light.

My mom had the AUDACITY to complain that I didn't inherit the skin and hair of her side of the family. (Like excuse me you are a light skinned woman with 4c hair wtf you talking about??). Even in my family's church I noticed that often the lightskinned women had more prominent church positions and were more likely to be dating or married to men with more money/power.
