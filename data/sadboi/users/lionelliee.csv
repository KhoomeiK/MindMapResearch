dating,fnj1ohr,t3_g1uf9i,1586990299.0,"Serious Question: Have you ever stopped looking for a relationship? 

For example, have you ever taken time for yourself to truly focus on your passions, your work, your hobbies, etc., while NOT actively looking to date someone at the same time?

Sometimes what you‚Äôre looking for, comes when you‚Äôre not looking at all. 

I also believe that you tend to attract the energy that you put out. When you‚Äôre lowering your standards/doubting yourself/pitying yourself/etc., you‚Äôre not putting out the energy that is going to attract a healthy relationship. 

IMO you should surrender your search. Let life take its course and pour your energy into what you love. Seriously. Your special person will come in good time."
