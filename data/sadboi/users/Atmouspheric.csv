I'm not saying its the cause of Corona I'm thinking its more of hows its spreading. 5g weaker immune system from what I've gathered it has negative health effects. It emits radiation or waves.

The dots are AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile.
(Americans government has their hands in these companies) 

Our bodies can't fight off the corona if we are or have weak immune  systems. Look at it like population control or a way of thinning out the herd.

Okay another thing certain states don't have 5g towers like Ohio but in Ohio we have 5g internet  wifi services along with our phones.  

Washington for example is the home state of bill gates.

We didn't have super powers or took a trip to hell, and we didn't become OP. Saints row 2 was just a good time.

They could have saved all the craziness for DLC 

The cheats were fun as hell. 
I was sad when they took the series to **let's see how crazy and chaotic we can get** the series to me became a big joke from what it was in a beginning but they also forgot what made the game series great and likable. Just my opinion though. It was like GTA but less serious which was cool. I didn't want it to be GTA.
