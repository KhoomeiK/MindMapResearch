Right now, lots of people are still judging rather than listening. People (both men and women) are still attached to their egos, social status, etc and put others down when they talk about their problems. I agree with what you're saying completely but we got quite a ways to go before things can be put in the right perspective."

1. Stop posting your snapchat filtered pics. I know your having fun, but I see 90% of profiles with it. I'm personally turned off by this. Some men disagree of course. 

2. Stop mentioning that you're not looking for a hookup. I get it, you want commitment and you slept around during your younger years, but I find it baffling that 90% of female profiles have to mention this. But I understand. Lots of men have to bother women asking for hookups.

3. This goes both ways. You want a quality man, then you need to be a quality woman as the same goes for men who want quality women.

I quit online dating and swore off dating until I have completely improved myself. Many people (men and women) are so entitled, put low effort into themselves and expect a good relationship. I know I'm not ready right now, but hopefully can experience something positive in the future."
