Episcopalian,fqhg7lb,t1_fqf08at,1589376326.0,Thank you for this list. I will definitely be checking out Fr. Robert Spitzer.
Anxiety,fqfv6q6,t1_fqfu6y3,1589332330.0,"Same. That'll just drag the postseason out far too long. I'm all for the robot umpires, though!"
Anxiety,fqf13bk,t1_fqf0bah,1589316948.0,"You're correct. MLB has been mulling this idea for years, I guess they decided it would be a good idea to try it out for a partial season and see how it's received."
Anxiety,fqey8ix,t1_fqex84s,1589315576.0,Same! I'm glad to hear I'm not the only nerd in Illinois! :)
agnostic,fqduy93,t1_fqb8kiu,1589297045.0,"It's not stupid of an agnostic to believe in an afterlife. Agnosticism simply means acknowledging that you don't know. Typically, when one claims the label *agnostic*, it simply means they do not know if gods exist, however, an afterlife does not presuppose the existence of a god; it is an independent possibility. I am in the process of reading Sam Harris' ""Waking Up"", and in it he even claims to be open to the possibility of consciousness surviving death."
Anxiety,fqbwzhy,t1_fqbvqw5,1589245580.0,"Even though this was a weekend with a holiday, the day after Easter (which I would argue is a bigger holiday than Mother's Day; for me personally, anyway) had around 8,000 more confirmed cases than today. I'm so hopeful this is the beginning of a prolonged trend of decreasing new cases and deaths. I'm going to be very interested in the numbers from the next few days."
Anxiety,fq8745t,t1_fq857hi,1589159847.0,"And it‚Äôs the most tests the US has done in one day as well! If my math is correct, we had slightly less than 4% for positive cases."
Anxiety,fq44bvv,t1_fq427f8,1589073496.0,"What does she give as the basis for her opinions? I'm especially intrigued by the notion that a vaccine is unlikely. That certainly doesn't track with the majority of opinions I have read on the matter; even the opinions of one very cautious Dr. Anthony Fauci. Unfortunately, sometimes when someone desperately wants to believe something, even if it is fatalistic or not fact-based, no amount of logical discourse can sway them from their opinions. The only advice I can give in a situation like yours is to return to your sources of news and science on the issue after speaking with her. You may not change her mind, but at least you can be informed yourself."
Anxiety,fq0mvv3,t1_fpzp7yq,1589034480.0,"Ha! My thought at first glance of this post was, ‚ÄúHoly shit! Michael Jordan had covid?!‚Äù Derp."
LockdownSkepticism,fpvjvah,t1_fpvih0o,1588946257.0,That is a problem. The sprawling suburban areas are in no way as densely populated as the city itself. I‚Äôve been watching our numbers very carefully because I live just east of St. Louis (not in East St. Louis) and the Chicago and Cook County numbers skew the entire state drastically.
LockdownSkepticism,fpvdw98,t1_fpv2ey5,1588942549.0,That happened where my wife works too. Someone actually even ripped a jug of hand sanitizer in a dispenser off the wall.
LockdownSkepticism,fpvdr7s,t1_fpvcbh0,1588942451.0,The reopening plan does divide the state into regions.
Anxiety,fppoy3c,t1_fpp4o46,1588806345.0,"Fauci said as much in an interview last week. I believe it was Savannah Guthrie who asked him if it would be possible to have a deployable vaccine by January and he said yes. When she asked him what changed in his 12-18 months suggestion, he said nothing had changed. He has been saying 12-18 months since January. January to January is ...wait for it... 12 months. Way to go, reporters."

Anxiety,foahapp,t1_foagt9e,1587646495.0,I just saw this video on CBS. What a beautiful gesture!
Anxiety,fo73ywe,t1_fo72dic,1587571833.0,"Maybe most people just thought it was flu and didn‚Äôt bother with doctors? I wonder if a lot of the rush on hospitals in places like New York was induced by panic. Of course that‚Äôs not a complete explanation, but I‚Äôve been wracking  my brain trying to figure out why the spike happened when it did if it has actually been spreading for longer than we know. My wife is a healthcare provider and she had been telling me for months (at least since December) they were seeing a ton of people exhibiting flu symptoms but were testing negative for flu on multiple occasions. It‚Äôs very puzzling."
RadicalChristianity,fo54evx,t1_fo4hlyw,1587517268.0,"Beyond just believing that eternal torture exists, some are absolutely gleeful about this belief. It's contemptible, really."
Anxiety,fo35lty,t1_fo32pp8,1587480980.0,I never implied it was. The second sentence of my post explicitly says I am not suggesting they ignored guidance. I was simply pointing out that just because a person holds a position of power does not ***necessarily*** imply that person makes all decisions based on the best interests of his or her constituents. That's not unique to this situation or to this administration and I didn't think such a sentiment would be so controversial. Clearly I was mistaken.
Anxiety,fo2y44d,t1_fo2ueyh,1587476759.0,"And those who make decisions can also disregard or ignore that information to suit their own interests. I'm not saying they have or will, but just blindly trusting someone because they're in a position of power seems insane to me. And beyond politics, the appeal to authority is a known logical fallacy."
Anxiety,fo2sj78,t1_fo1m3b6,1587472996.0,"They don't *seem* dirty; they *are* dirty. Obviously, I can only speak to gyms I have patronized, but most members don't adhere to towel or cleaning rules. If I had a nickel for every bench I had to wipe down because someone else didn't, I wouldn't need a gym; I'd be able to hire a personal trainer to come to my house! I think this is a terrible idea, but I hope I'm wrong. I'm definitely going to be watching what happens in Georgia and South Carolina with great interest."
Anxiety,fnwfm8c,t1_fnvvd3z,1587317461.0,"""Right wing liberals""? Is that what you meant? I'm not being snarky or a jerk, I'm really curious if there is some fringe group of right-leaning liberals on this site. I'm fairly new here and have really only frequented this and a Dune sub."
Anxiety,fnwbwon,t1_fnw1m1e,1587315423.0,"I understand that. However, the bias of the source can definitely influence the content of the articles publicized. My concern with articles from places like this is the possibility that they are cherry-picking articles to reinforce their opinion while ignoring others. This article seems to have sourced its information from reputable, reasonably unbiased sources though."

Anxiety,fnsa7k8,t1_fns9je6,1587216982.0,"I read a week or so ago the critical temperature is 22.5 C, which is around 72.5 F. I hope that‚Äôs true, because a lot of places should be getting there in the next few weeks; in the US at least."

Anxiety,fnbavo5,t1_fnb69dq,1586812283.0,"The model had Illinois' totals really messed up. There were days last week where the model showed no deaths, even though our Department of Public Health reported around 60 deaths(ish) on each of those days. We were already higher than the total projected deaths on the model; but they fixed all of that in the update today. Our total projected deaths doubled, unfortunately, but at least it's more accurate now."

Anxiety,fn8i7c4,t3_fj2y1a,1586742226.0,"If Worldometers is to be believed, it looks like the US closed out today with around 300 fewer deaths and 3,000 fewer new cases than yesterday. Let‚Äôs hope this is the start of a trend downward!"
Anxiety,fn34i07,t1_fn3129z,1586612623.0,"Much of what the Daily Wire story attributes to Fauci is true, but the headline is fairly out of context. I watched the interview they're referencing yesterday morning and, while he did say a ""normal"" summer was possible, he stated that any moves we make toward normalcy should be slow and measured to ensure this type of outbreak doesn't happen again. His tone was cautiously optimistic, but he was hopeful that Americans could possibly be able to take summer vacations that may have been planned for months. His caution was apparent in the long quote in the article, but I worry that people will ignore the context of the article for the cheery headline. Please do not misunderstand me; I want this all to be true, since I've had two trips so far I've had to cancel and one in July I am hopeful for."
Anxiety,fn0oiui,t1_fn0mrdc,1586545754.0,And our death peak was supposed to be Sunday but was changed to yesterday. Our number of deaths has also been cut nearly in half. This is all great news!
Anxiety,fmgcd93,t3_fuzjcm,1586045893.0,"I've been noticing this recently. I hadn't put the coffee/anxiety connection together until this morning. The only difference in my morning routine between yesterday and today was two cups of coffee this morning. I was much more anxious this morning than yesterday. I'm switching to tea, at least until the current nightmare is over."

Anxiety,fm5fb18,t1_fm59q8r,1585771869.0,"And that's the problem, isn't it? I'm just finally hearing large news outlets admitting it is survivable for the vast, VAST majority of cases and reporting on recoveries. It's unconscionable to me that it took them this long to stop solely focusing on the negatives. Maybe enough people got the ""stay the fuck home"" memo, so the media feels like it can back off a bit."
Anxiety,fm2txto,t1_fm2t28n,1585705351.0,Hell yes. And then send me out to build drive-through testing centers and deliver groceries.
Anxiety,fm2q6yc,t1_fm2piye,1585702881.0,"This is great news!

I've been doing pretty good at avoiding other social media outlets, but I went on Facebook for a minute after hearing that a woman in her 30s died today in my county; just to distract myself for a minute. Then I read about the phony numbers and I'm worried, both about the potential of a much higher death rate and that someone in my age group died from my county. It's going to be a long few weeks."

Anxiety,flrtu2d,t1_flr9pv1,1585427726.0,"I will say, too, that sometimes taking a drive and listening to some music can be therapeutic in and of itself. Some of the people in those cars may leave their houses, drive for an hour without stopping or getting out of their cars, and go back home just to hit a ""reset"" button and keep from getting cabin fever. That's just a possibility, obviously, but worth considering I think."
Anxiety,flbz6ju,t3_fnvksh,1585016037.0,"I quit smoking completely about 10 years ago and it was one of the hardest things I've ever done. I agree with your suggestion that it's not always about the nicotine, but about the crutch. By the time I quit, the nicotine wasn't doing anything for me anymore anyway. But, I found I missed my morning cigarette on the drive to work. Not smoking while driving was always harder than not smoking while drinking. What stops me from going back to smoking is  I enjoy not being winded doing the smallest tasks. That and my wife, who is a nurse, would kill me. Good luck, stranger.

Anxiety,fl84iui,t1_fkpk4e5,1584915712.0,"Exactly this. I keep reading Midnightapalooza's posts over and over again, because they are so optimistic and comforting.

Anxiety,fkykbys,t1_fkbgtfi,1584650446.0,"This was absolutely me as a kid. When my parents weren't on time picking me up from the babysitter, they had obviously gotten into a fatal car accident. I had largely gotten over that as an adult, but it's coming screaming back at me now. My wife is a nurse practitioner and she works in primary care and I am absolutely terrified she will have a serious case of this disease. She has no underlying health conditions and is 38 years old, so realistically, nothing too serious will probably happen. But catastrophizing is something at which I am very skilled. On top of this, my work has moved me to an administrative leave status, so I have all day to sit alone at home and worry. This was my first day at home. It's not going well."
