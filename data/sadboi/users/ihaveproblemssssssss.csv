BPD,fp9sram,t1_fp9qown,1588433787.0,"Yeah I feel you so much on that. I want to leave just because I get trigerred so much. On the flip side I'm thinking there's got to be someone somewhere that triggers me less, right? Just an overall easier time."
BPD,fp9emm0,t3_gc4p5w,1588424087.0,That's an interesting take. Tell us later long term how it went for you?
BPD,fop0n73,t3_g8qmpy,1587950476.0,"Hey I'm so sorry. I went through a nasty break up last year and I wasn't sure I would ever heal. It took me over 6 months to forgive them / myself / and starting to move on. I know first end how desperate you can start to feel. Sometimes writing those letters / going to therapy / meditating / gratefulness exercises helps. 

What helped me the most was solo travel, I know it's not the right time for it right now. But the main point is to try and keep yourself busy as much as you can so you don't spend all your time spiralling. 

Welcome to the sub. I hope you find some comfort here ❤️ Stay strong."
BPD,foovbf5,t3_g8pl2o,1587947226.0,Yeah all the time. Sometimes these thoughts get so real my heart starts beating like crazy and all the emotions feel 100% real.
BPD,foheqo8,t3_g7h7ar,1587764711.0,"My SO does similar things... It hurts me as well. I asked them to not talk about having sex with other people. We can't prevent them from fantisizing but if your boyfriend can't understand this hurts you and filter this out, he's just a dick.

It makes me split so hard and I lose trust / pull away."
BPD,fof9ry5,t3_g779j1,1587730587.0,I don't do this but several of my friends wPBD do so you aren't alone :)
BPD,fnvqwfl,t1_fntvxwa,1587302345.0,A lot of my friends with BPD explain their symptoms with different personalities so you're not alone. I don't personally do that.
BPD,fnvqttw,t1_fngjhkg,1587302287.0,"No, I don't hold any grudges at all in general"
BPD,fnvqqog,t3_g47bk5,1587302217.0,Yeah I mean I would bring it up to him if it bothers you weeks after. You're probably not going to get over it without a talk at this point.
BPD,fly3bc6,t3_frtgr3,1585594746.0,"What I do when this happens to me is I try to keep myself busy with other things. It doesn't matter what - your mind just needs to stop obsessing about the relationship, the what ifs, and what you could possibly do to make things better.

I know it's hard. I hate starts of relationships so much. I thrive when I'm past the 3-6 months mark and feel safe. Dating can be hell with BPD."
BPD,fkhj6cr,t1_fkfy3mh,1584200073.0,"This. For having fully quit in the past, this is so true. Weed gives me the worse brain fog and when you're in that cycle it's really hard to even notice."
BPD,fkfuvp9,t3_fi8j16,1584143096.0,"I always feel like something bad is going to happen. If they don't, I somehow make bad things happen."
BPD,fkedcom,t3_fi06qa,1584110799.0,"Numbs the feelings, numbs the thinking. It's going overboard for me though, I need to reduce intake. It's affecting my work."
