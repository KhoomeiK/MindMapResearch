bisexual,fkq21ms,t3_fk0auf,1584427300.0,"So I'm F28, and I may have some insight here:

In my early and mid 20s, I could get all kinds of guys, but no girls. It was a similar deal - they just weren't into me. Over time, I came to realize the issue was my demographic. I was looking for women my own age. Once I started looking for woman a decade or so older than me, my success rate increased.

Older women are more down in general, in my experience. The ones I've met tend to be less hung up on looks - yours and their own. 

Idk your age or gender, but you might give it a try and see if going for older women works for you. Best of luck! 💖💜💙"

I wouldn't worry too much about losing steam after round 3. 

Would you feel comfortable communicating with your girlfriend about this in the future? Like, letting her know you're tapped out so you wouldn't have to fake it? 

That being said, what you're describing in your arousal patterns is pretty bi. Granted, a man can finger himself and like it without being gay or bi, but having a full-on wet dream about another dude sounds like a pretty clear indicator of homosexual attraction.

Deep down tho, it feels awkward; kind of off, but it can be hard to identify in the rush of superficial excitement.

I only recognize this after years of hindsight. Looking back, I wasn't all that attracted to most of the guys I've dated (I'm F28). A lot of times, I couldn't even kiss them unless I was drunk or otherwise altered. I spent a lot of time going through the motions, doing what I thought was culturally expected of me. I didn't realize as much until now, when I was blessed to find a girl with whom I have both an emotional and physical connection. I love her so much. 

I hope you find someone with whom to share a deep connection, too. You're worth it 💖💜💙"
