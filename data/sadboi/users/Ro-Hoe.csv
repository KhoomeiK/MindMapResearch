popheads,fquwsuh,t1_fqut5i0,1589665736.0,100 Gecs was inspired by Charli XCX it's just come full circle now
xcxheads,fqudb0w,t3_gkyh5x,1589656768.0,Wahoo I’m that other user. Nice list. Vroom Vroom is too powerful. I also need to edit it more because as expected a lot of songs from “how I’m feeling now” moved up

popheads,fqoe35p,t1_fqo4kig,1589513173.0,Not having features is critically important to the album's theme/concept

xcxheads,fqnxckx,t1_fqmfohm,1589503268.0,i finally understand is my least favorite track as well and I like it a lot. The whole project is so solid
xcxheads,fqnx9u1,t1_fqnv8w9,1589503224.0,I love it but don't think it's pop 2 level. It's probably a mix of it being brand new and doesn't have any low points like Charli did
popheads,fqnvf47,t3_gjx71l,1589502172.0,She is like 1970's David Bowie level in her ability to release non stop 8-10/10 albums at this pace

xcxheads,fq4ymyt,t1_fq4yflj,1589087432.0,I don’t mind if things are more commercial ( thank u next is a fav album of mine too) but those songs just stick out as sore thumbs to me. They don’t mesh with the sound of the album to me
xcxheads,fq4lw50,t1_fq4lpi3,1589079396.0,Nice! TPAB- is a ten to me and MBDTF and money store are a 9. Charli is an 8 to me (1999 and blame it on your love are huge misses to me)

illinois,fq258e9,t1_fq24kep,1589052945.0,I’m getting $650 a week in Illinois so it depends where you are. And this is a Illinois sub
illinois,fq1om73,t1_fq1o329,1589047548.0,I think there’s a limit to how much each individual can get but maybe that’s changed because of the $600 thing. I don’t get why unemployment money is so high honestly
illinois,fq1jdyy,t1_fq1eutr,1589046178.0,I’m on unemployment and it’s gonna run out soon. (I’m a server). We need to open up but with just increased cautions in indoor businesses

SmallYTChannel,fmic11y,t3_fvd8sq,1586106569.0,Reminded me of south park a lot. I like it but the voice got a little annoying which I get was the point lol. It was good though! When video game videos have no editing they're pointless unless it's a walkthrough. The point of making it a video is to entertain people in a way that's not just watching someone else play so good critiques on your end

SmallYTChannel,fmcfncf,t3_fue4q8,1585944751.0,I would focus on editing the video to a shorter faster pace. I don't mind the idea of the subtitles being used in the middle but they should be used for punchline moments / what you think will hit the hardest. It just feels repetitive if it's on the screen at all times. You guys seem likable so keep working on it!
