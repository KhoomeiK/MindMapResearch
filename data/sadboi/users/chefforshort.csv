AskWomen,fr52nqx,t1_fr4zpwn,1589901417.0,"You're describing a situation that makes me think he was susceptible to seasonal affects on undiagnosed depression. And also interpreted it as a gauge on how your relationship was. In reality they could very well have been separate. I've been known to deal with these episodes and fortunately my SO knows it is in no way a measurement to my devotion and love. Ive also learned to recognize these symptoms and work to not direct them at her but acknowledge them and work through them. 
If this is the case, or in any case, I know its not really what you may want to hear but as a significant other, after 2.5 years of constantly being told you're unsure, in cycles will generate a lot of doubt the other direction as well. I just asked my so to marry me after 4 years. I never would have made it to this point without her understanding, support, and assurance I'm still the person they want to marry.
 I hope you find what I have. I'm 33 and its taken till now."
