Then steam the artichoke (upside down) in a steaming basket for about 40 minutes until the outside leaves come off with no resistance.

Then place artichokes (with open side facing up) on an aluminum foil lined baking sheet, brush open faces with olive oil and then sprinkle Montreal Steak Seasoning on the open faces and bake at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes.

Serve with melted butter and Tarragon.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fp6bkbr,t1_fp645em,1588349515.0,"Aww, Thank you!  Yes, while I don't have a lot of ambition, I do consider my work ethic very strong!  Our pup is doing OK.  She is 5 and 1/2 and her first Lateral Suture surgery was at 1 1/2 years.  Her 2nd surgery (on the other hind leg - which is typical after one leg goes, the other usually goes within a year - we got a little over 2 years) was exactly a year ago.  The recoveries were long and difficult (trying to keep a pitbull calm and inactive for 4-6 months IS HARD) but she's doing great now.  She can walk and run but she will sometimes limp after too much exercise.  We love her very much and are hopeful she doesn't have to have future surgeries but the lateral suture isn't a guaranteed life time fix.  Thanks for asking :). Long story, we always intended on getting pet insurance for her, however, we had this ""puppy plan"" that covered most normal vet needs for the first 2 years of her life and were going to get the insurance when it expired.  Unfortunately, her first leg had issues at 1 1/2 years (and was NOT part of the ""puppy plan"") so when we did get pet insurance afterward, it was considered a pre-existing condition and and was not covered.  The other leg was also NOT covered because of the nature of the injury so BOTH of those $5,000.00 surgeries were out of pocket.  Another long story, my husband and I went on a cruise with my family to Alaska and while we were gone - our dog ate a large part of a Chuck-It rubber ball and it got stuck in her belly.  THAT WAS HELL and she was in and out of the vet the whole time we were on the cruise - only upon our return did they finally realize the issue and she had to have surgery to get it out.  That bill was $13,000.00 (emergency vet, etc.) and luckily, our insurance covered $8,000.00 of it.  If we had not had insurance, that would have financially devastated us for a long time."

I have stayed at most jobs for about 3-5 years and just move on to the next when I‚Äôm over it or want to try something new.  My parents did not go to college and didn‚Äôt put a lot of emphasis on higher education and probably figured I‚Äôd get married and be a mom/housewife.

Only saying this because they have a very weird and unique situation.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fozlq3v,t1_fozkz7x,1588192767.0,"I hear with you and agree with your points.  Unfortunately, it may take just that - the stop of the MTV money - before she has no other choice but to figure it out (meaning, get to work).  At that point, she will likely regret not having learned a trade or any job experience by dipping a foot in the working pool and will be forced to take whatever minimum wage job that she can get.  Maybe she will be a public speaker like Leah?  Didn't they try to have a clothing business (was it Nova Lee) like Maci?  I wish they had strong guidance (mentors) in their lives.  I am hopeful that things work out for them, fingers crossed."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,foz739c,t1_foz69r4,1588185779.0,"Honestly, I didn't miss the point.  I understand that everyone is basically saying that Cate is lazy and anything that actually requires ""work"" or long term commitment, she can't/won't do it.  I think a lot of people are missing another point though where at least she is making progress of recognizing ""hey, this is more than I can handle so maybe I won't pursue this"" instead of just going for it and then quitting half way through.  Life is a lot of unknowns and I definitely have a lot of empathy for the crazy trauma she's been through.  Being raised by THAT Mom (who, also, I'm sure had the best of intentions but.....wow) and carrying a baby that she put up for adoption (I know Tyler did, too, and he's well adjusted, even with Butch as a father) but I think it might be a tiny bit harder on the person who actually carried the baby, I don't know.  Anyway, I do see the point - I guess I'm just more willing to give her a bit of a pass on some things.  It's ok though, I understand where you guys are coming from - I really do."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,foz6c5i,t1_foz5pix,1588185421.0,"I hear what you are saying and know that there have been other examples of eager starts and abrupt stops when things become challenging, however, I can speak from first hand experience that working in a veterinarian office is gnarly and definitely not for someone who already struggles with depression.  I wasn't even a vet tech, I was front office and it was taxing AF (mentally).  She is lucky to have a current situation that can afford her to work on herself and she should put that as her first priority so she can be a great partner to Tyler and even better Mom to her kids.  Once she has been stable for an extended period of time (like 2 YEARS) then she can explore something else (I think being an advocate for pet fostering/adoption would be a great thing for her and she can jump on to an already existing organization where she has help from people who have experience)."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,foz4qzh,t3_ga9dl2,1588184665.0,"Dang, I understand it is easy to criticize Cate for a lot of things but all of these comments are so harsh.  She was interested in becoming a vet tech so she looked into it and realized it wasn't for her.  Isn't that part of growing and figuring your shit out?  Everyone pointing out that she's an adult and should have it all figured out already.  Sheesh, I'm 47, been working since I was 14 and STILL don't know what I want to do with my life.  I am so glad I'm not a public figure subjecting myself to scrutiny on this level.  I'm rooting for you Cate and it's OK to not know what you want to do with your life forever.  You can figure it out along the way.  Please be compassionate, not everyone is lucky enough to know what the heck they want to do in this life.

COVIDGoodNews,forlwbz,t1_for6p2e,1588014439.0,"Further - because I saw the same video and was like ‚Äúummmmmm?‚Äù - I sent it to a friend who is far more intelligent than I and has an Aunt and Uncle who work at the CDC.  His response to that video was:

‚ÄúTo start, their company is called ‚Äúaccelerated‚Äù(lame) and they‚Äôre ‚Äúentrepreneurs‚Äù(douchebags).  This means they‚Äôre selling something. Second, they‚Äôve ‚Äútaken classes in microbiology and immunology‚Äù. Immunology relates to covid but microbiology is a very broad field and part of any medical doctor‚Äôs undergrad curriculum. Next, yes they‚Äôre doctors but they‚Äôre not epidemiologists.  That‚Äôs like saying a plumber could build a skyscraper. 

Yadayadayada, he‚Äôs not wrong that people with other illnesses are avoiding going to to hospitals because they‚Äôre afraid of covid. They should still be going but take appropriate measures to protect themselves. And, the point of not flooding the hospitals with covid patients was so that patients with these other ailments wouldn‚Äôt be stranded when the hospitals were overwhelmed(this happened in China).  So many holes in this guys logic to begin with. ‚ÄúCalifornia hardly has any cases.‚Äù (He‚Äôs in Kern county, a very rural, less populated, less densely populated area of California).  New York has had overwhelming numbers of people die. What this shows is that California had more time to implement measures that work. So is he advocating that we should stop practicing what works?  This guy is enraging. Just for you I‚Äôll watch the rest later but he‚Äôs full of shit and I‚Äôll take him down point by point.


And here‚Äôs what‚Äôs more, the type of person that thinks to themselves; ‚Äúyeah this doc from accelerated is on to something(he went to Western Univ Of Health Sciences/College Of Osteopathic Medicine Of The Pacific, Western University Of Health Sciences) is the same type of idiot that says ‚Äúfire Fauci‚Äù about the dr. that got his degree from fucking Cornell!‚Äù

Anxiety,fnw56lq,t1_fnvmpuf,1587311660.0,"Thanks for reaching out.  Yes some days are better than others but just now I woke up and dry heaved into the toilet for like 2 minutes.  Since I don‚Äôt eat much, nothing came out but I had to take 1/2 a 0.25mg Xanax and I‚Äôm waiting for it to kick in.  I try to not ever take the Xanax because I‚Äôm fearful of building a tolerance or dependency on it.  This feeling comes immediately upon waking.  Like I just want this nightmare to be over.  I subscribed to the Stoic app but I‚Äôm not using it and I know I should.  I try to avoid the news and just watch mindless tv for distraction but every commercial is about coronavirus and it just sends me spiraling into not IF my husband and I get it but WHEN and then when that happens, my panic disorder will give me a heart attack.  Sorry for ranting I‚Äôm just in the throes of a panic episode now.  I try to breathe it out but I‚Äôm relying on the medication today."

Anxiety,fn0fkaz,t1_fmzzm8f,1586541020.0,"I'm experiencing exact SAME as you and it is HELL.  Every night, I wake up in a panic then start dry-heaving and makes me panic worse.  Once I actually puked in my bed.  I have to take 1/2 of a 0.25mg Xanax and try to breathe my way back to sleep.  I hate it.  I've also lost 15 lbs in the past month because I can barely eat without gagging.  I wish I could just get a good nights sleep and relax.  I don't want to take Xanax either - only when I'm literally experiencing these middle of the night episodes.  I hope you find some relief, too.  I downloaded and subscribed to an App called STOIC yesterday and am hopeful it helps.  I'm sorry you are going through this."

I feel like it is connected to the detox process of quitting."
stopsmoking,fmx44c2,t3_fxqd7e,1586458119.0,"I quit 16 days ago and am doing ok but my anxiety is through the roof (I'm positive it is more related to the pandemic and not the quitting).  My husband quit 14 days ago and he is experiencing tooth pain and gum swelling and is really concerned.  I told him that the tooth pain/swelling is part of the detox process and he believes me but I'm concerned for him, too.  We really don't want to have to go to a dentist or a doctor during all of this virus spreading.  Anyone else experience tooth pain/gum swelling and when will it start to subside.  Any advise for how to treat it?"
