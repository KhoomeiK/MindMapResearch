depression,etpefl5,t1_etp7yoi,1563053220.0,"you said nobody cares and i was trying to be nice for you even tho i don't know you cause i guess i understand what you're going thru. i'm not trying to make myself feeling like a good person, i don't care about that. i thought replying something nice to you would make you feel better and it's no effort too so why not 
i was just trying to be nice and give you some encouraging words cause sometimes that can mean a lot. sometimes some positive words even from a stranger can make you feel good.
but i'm sorry if i offended you..."
AnxietyDepression,eto1ftv,t1_etmk3fm,1563008967.0,let her know you love her and care and will be there for her and you'll help her out and support her and she won't have to go thru this alone.
depression,eto16cu,t3_cclpcd,1563008633.0,"Happy birthday!

I know people say this a lot, to a point where it sounds stupid but it does get better. Being depressed while a teenager is hard but as year pass it really gets better. I'm not saying you're suddenly gonna become the happiest person on earth, but the older you are the easier it gets. you stop worrying about some things and are a lot more used to certain emotions or situations and they don't hurt as much anymore. you're young, give yourself time and take chances to change your life for better and try being a little bit more optimistic (trust me i know it's not easy).
I wish you the best of luck with everything!"
