Idk I'm just not surprised someone is rep checking an IG account as shady as they may seem. If they're new they might just want to try a new source. That said you can think what you want I'm just saying I'm personally not that surprised no matter how shady the source seems.

CanadianMOMs,flayfrx,t1_flawwto,1584993664.0,Yes he's condescending. And just throwing the f word at you when you're most likely statistically correct. So far there's a higher mortality rate due to vehicular manslaughter then there is with the COVID-19. Mortality rate is under 2%  (in those infected) in Canada. the biggest reason for this quarantine is so that we don't spread it to people until we develop a vaccine so those in groups susceptible to dying to this disease don't develop it. Right now if you're a 55 year old smoker covid is either a death sentence or will create scarring in your lungs that will basically be a pre-existing condition and could result in death in your next case of pneumonia or severe bronchitis from what I understand. Even if you don't die from it it's equivalent to having a severe flu. I just had a flu that lasted from January 3rd until January 19th in which I actually coughed up blood. So I really do not want to get even though I'm not technically in a susceptible group.

I use flex delivery so if it's scanned at my post office it's available right away. I've had parcels get into my flexbox Saturdays before. Our post office receives their shipments around noon and 7:30pm. I talked to a representative while creating a ticket to get email notifications and obviously she couldn't say they were slow but she says she's seen packages stuck at sorting facilities for two days. Seeing that Canada Post modified their guarantees I'd say they're expecting to be slow. Given the situation it's understandable but they operating at low efficiency because of their necessary safety precautions. I'm just a little bummed is all lol.

This doesn't make me feel bad for people, this makes me think this guy's a petty douchebag. It makes me want to laugh in his face. If I was doing something gay and he did this in front of me just to fuck with me I would seriously put the finger up at him and just laugh but in the world with violent homophobia you can't really do that as easily. I don't want to say people are being overly sensitive because people are exposed to different levels of abuse and I have compassion for that so I do understand where you're coming from.

CanadianMOMs,fl2t0tq,t1_fl204u4,1584759152.0,this is mostly true although if you wanted to you could use good quality weed and you'd probably have bomb edibles. But it's not necessary to use good quality weed to make bomb edibles. The reason is because the extraction process last so long that most of what can be binded to the butter will be binded to the butter (fats) overtime with heat.
CanadianMOMs,fl1zp8m,t1_fl1oiaf,1584739721.0,"You should add more flower (or extract) and make your own edibles instead üòâ. If you need tips on how to make a potent butter that hardly tastes like cannabis I have a bunch and a wonderful recipe for you to follow that I can either post or DM to you. Normally lots of edibles are made with distillate (especially gummies) so you don't get the high from terpenes. Making your own edibles allows you to dose better and have an all around better buzz associated to the strain you want. Hope this information helps dude!


Edit:wow, I really didn't expect this many people to want the recipe I'm a little bit busy at the moment. But I'll fish out the recipe and posts it in the next hour or two thanks for your interest everyone. stay safe!

Edit2: hi everybody, wasn't able to fish out the post. so just typing out the recipe. should be up soon.

Necessary materials:

‚Ä¢ Double boiler* or crock pot (crock pot is easier)
‚Ä¢ One Oz (or two if you want really potent ones) of shake, trim or popcorn nugs
‚Ä¢ Cheese cloth (at least 1-1/2 foot) 
‚Ä¢ 2 1/4 cups of unsalted butter or 7gs of rosin/distillate/shatter
‚Ä¢ 5 cups of water
‚Ä¢ silicone spatula
‚Ä¢ spoon
‚Ä¢ pan
‚Ä¢ recipient for melted butter (2 cups)
‚Ä¢ baking sheet
‚Ä¢ parchment paper/baking paper
‚Ä¢ Empty bowl (not plastic) that is refrigerator safe (ideally a lid) that is big enough to accommodate 5 cups (you will have 4 3/4 liquid about to transfer into it)
‚Ä¢ lots of bloody time

*  *A double boiler is a cooking technique used to keep the contents of a bowl at a low and consistent temperature (they use this is confectionery to melt chocolate). To create a double boiler check your pots and metal/glass bowls for a bowl that fits into the pot. The bowl should sit at 2/3 of the way up (from the counter). If it sits a bit lower that's fine. It will only mean that you will have to add water more frequently to the pot as the contents of the pot will evaporate twenty times over. if you want a visual of what a double boiler looks like you can Google image search it's quite intuitive.*

Method:

Step 1: butter clarifying

‚Ä¢ The first step will be to clarify the butter. To clarify butter take your 2 1/4 cups butter slice it into 4-6 parts and melt them in a pot on the stove top at a medium element temperature. 

‚Ä¢ Once melted bring the heat up a little bit at a time (every 30 seconds to a minute) until you see many bubbles starting to form somewhat rapidly (more than a few bubbles occasionally popping up). as the temperature goes up you will notice that there is a lot of bubble and foam which is starting to form. 

‚Ä¢Using your spatula and a spoon, tilt the pot a little bit and use the spatula to gather the foam. Once you've done this set the pot back down while keeping the foam in place with the spatula and use the spoon to pick up/skim the foam off the surface of the melted butter. 

‚Ä¢ Continue this process for about 20-30 minutes or until almost no foam or bubbles remain. 

‚Ä¢ Remove the butter oil from the pan and place it in a recipient

This will create a product known as butter oil and it is the reason that we used 2 and a quarter cups of butter instead of 2 cups of butter so that we can still retain two cups of butter at the end.

Step 2 Cannabis decarboxylation (optional for extracts):

For starters this part is optional but many people swear by decarboxylation so I'm including it.

‚Ä¢ Preheat your Oven to 235-250¬∞F 

‚Ä¢ Start by grinding all of your herb product (not required for extracts but spread it thin if it's in a pile) into as fine a size as you can. Doesn't have to be dust but the finer the better. You can also just clump the buds and decarb those but then you have to grind decarbed weed to increase the surface contact area when in the butter and that's not great

‚Ä¢ Using the baking tray and the parchment paper lay all of the herb in the thin layer on top of the parchment paper which has been placed in the baking tray

‚Ä¢ Place the tray in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes. when you remove the tray you should notice that the Cannabis has darkened in colour.

Step 3 Cannabis Extraction Process:

‚Ä¢ Set up the double boiler as mentioned in the asterix. Set the water 1/2 inch under the bow and the temperature to just under the ""high"" mark on your temperature control dial. If you are using a crock pot simply start the crock pot on a low setting 190-200 degrees Fahrenheit. 

‚Ä¢ Add your decarboxylated cannabis or cannabis extract to the butter in the double boiler / crock pot

‚Ä¢ Add 2 1/2 cups of water to the double boiler / crock pot
If you are using a crock pot leave it on for 12-24 hours and stir every couple hours (not necessary when you are asleep if you do 24 hours). come back to it after the end of the period.

** If you are using a double boiler then you will have to continuously check the water level in the pot so that you can constantly Add water to the setup so you don't ruin your pot. I have it down now so that I have enough water to check every 20 minutes. As well I wouldn't recommend 24 hours with this method as it alot of energy. 6 - 12 hours is fine**

‚Ä¢ Once your time is done the extraction process it completed and it's time to strain your cannabutter. Start by letting it cool for a good 25-35 minutes until you can comfortably stick your finger in the warm cannabutter (not required for extracts)

‚Ä¢ using your large refrigerator safe recipient, and cheesecloth strain and separate the herb product from the liquid by pouring the liquid over the cheesecloth and then squeezing the cheesecloth until you can hardly get any liquid when squeezing.

‚Ä¢ take the refrigerator safe recipient and place it in the refrigerator for 4 - 5  hours or overnight. The butter will rise to the top during this process and you will be able to separate the disc of butter from the water. you can also scrape the bottom part as there will be a little bit of plant matter on it and remove that or use it for something that you don't mind having a stronger cannabis taste

‚Ä¢ once this is done you can optionally repeat the extraction process with another 2 and 1/2 cups of water, reintroducing the ground bud/butter mixture but you will only need about an hour of time for the second round (this won't be required for people using extracts). The second round produces little difference in phase but can still help in removing some of the chlorophyll/plant taste.


Hope you guys enjoy this recipe!

UnsentLetters,fl1ftiu,t3_flwtn3,1584728147.0,did he ask you to change? Or did you just change because you felt no reciprocation in your method? Because it's also okay for him to have different ways to express his love and for you to have different ways to express your love. You both don't have to express your love in similar ways what's important is that you appreciate each other's Love. I'm sorry you feel that you shouldn't be together but I think the fact that you've been together for 6 years means you both owe each other to try at least. You should talk to him about it and maybe consider couples therapy. Best of luck with everything.
TrueOffMyChest,fl1fca1,t1_fl1du17,1584727877.0,"Yeah definitely good advice there. You think leaving her with a suicide hotline would exempt you from being charged?

TrueOffMyChest,fl0tu0l,t1_fl0eer8,1584715601.0,I mean if she's not being serious then I would do it only as a last resort. I would only threaten to call the police first unless she calms down and takes it back. You don't want to put somebody in the hospital who isn't actually suicidal and waste a bunch of resources and people's time for a bluff because she wants to manipulate people. Obviously normally you should take suicide seriously but if it's someone who's known to use it as manipulation then call their bluff. They'll watch what they say  most likely. Not many people want to be taken away by the police. You could call a suicide hotline as well just to stay with her and talk to her while you leave and let them handle it while she's distracted.
TrueOffMyChest,fl0tacw,t3_flsbsj,1584715261.0,I mean I'd probably kill myself if my girlfriend left me but I don't tell her this cuz I'm not a douche and it's by no means her fault...but I think she has pieced it together herself since I have been suicidal and shared those thoughts with her before being in therapy. Good thing I'm kind to her and she's kind to me so there shouldn't be any risk of anything drastic happening.

CBG releases at 125¬∞F in a vape so I figure you'd be safe at 100¬∞F. Room temp is 23¬∞C so it will definitely not vaporize or burn at 37¬∞C.

Assuming this temperature doesnt harden the mix too much it should work... Otherwise wait the longest you can you just need to make sure it's well folded in like egg whites and evenly dispersed.

Hope someone with more experience answers you but that my 2¬¢

You could also make / use a double boiler. Technically it should keep it at a temperature low enough to fold in the distillate especially if you work fast. It's low enough temp to prevent THC in weed from vaping so it should work for distillate. And it's warm enough to melt sugar so...

TrueOffMyChest,fjmhnvg,t1_fjlwjfs,1583470858.0,There's a point where it ceases to be kindness if the criticism is constant. You don't know what kind of issues she has. She may have a health issue and it may be difficult for her to lose weight... You're being rather aggressive about this haha. She said she recognized she had to lose weight so idk why you're lecturing her about things she most likely knows about obesity. Plus we don't even know what weight she is or if she's even obese to begin with. Way to unload on someone over almost nothing lol
TrueOffMyChest,fjbhwbi,t1_fj3py9q,1583193643.0, I mean I don't give a shit I'm just saying... I don't think you are friends if that's how you feel about it. Granted he hasn't made your life easy either so I don't really blame you for not wanting to be his friend. Just saying a friend would actually care that this may impact him permanently and not brush it off with that kind of rationalization.

UnsentLetters,fipqwsk,t3_f8z95w,1582617053.0,"Just curious. Apart from the obvious cheating, what made him a narcissist?  Did you ever really love him a lot or did you just drift apart and begin to notice things as you drifted?
I'm glad you had an excuse to divorce someone you didn't really want to be with because that could be a horrible life. I'm glad I found someone I want to actually be with... I just hope we don't drift apart but I think it will be okay because I'm nice to her and treat her equally and with respect."
ihavesex,filna6t,t3_f8czb7,1582505638.0,Well you kind of need that context if you're shaming him about something he did after sex...

Saying it once is okay because it could just be momentary disbelief (although it is a little rude even still). He's a family member not a judge, it's basically his job to support his family members if they're raped... Even if he has doubt he should still try to put it aside and say things like ""if that's true then that's awful"" ... Like at least acknowledge something... I can say I blame you for getting angry at him..."

TrueOffMyChest,fhrv8so,t3_f4fxvj,1581840319.0,This is so sad. I feel bad for the OP. This could have been my life if my mom had died when she got cancer when I was 8. I could have regret for things like similar to this story. I always known I've been lucky and I've thought about what would happen if she had passed and how sad I'd be of course but...idk for some reason this puts things in perspective more than I've ever. I'm sorry you have this regret OP I hope one day you can really convince yourself that your father probably knows that you were just used to your mother and just a kid. He probably knew you loved him so much...
