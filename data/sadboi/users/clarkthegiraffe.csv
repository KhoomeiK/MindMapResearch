Before this situation got serious I applied to work for Instacart as a side job and they took a long time to get my background check approved, which it finally did this morning. 

I'm a healthy 25yo guy, I live with my boyfriend and nobody in my house is part of the at-risk population. Doing this job would help keep other people at home, since people who follow social distancing really seem to only break it to go out to the supermarket. And I admit being able to make some extra money is tempting. However I've seen the virus can live on surfaces for x amount of time, and I don't know if that would count for groceries.

Obviously I'd be going out with a mask and gloves but that won't matter if someone else touches a product that goes to someone else's home. I'd like to do my part and am not sure if it's better for me to stay home myself, or do something that would keep other people from (potentially) going out and bringing the virus to their houses. As long as I'm not sure, I'm just gonna stay put.
