dankmemes,fbagrq2,t3_ec9wxg,1576677731.0,Hey... Just got out of the hospital... Can say for a fact that I LOVE this post as I almost died and had to go around getting an ambulance... I was actually wanting to call one so I could get straight on back without having to wait and die in the waiting room. Ended up going to urgent care and they sent me home. Needless to say I ended up having to go back to the Hospital and have life saving surgery.... You all make really good points...

OCD,f237pja,t3_dbnx9e,1569909575.0,"I've had OCD since I could remember... Not the little stuff like counting, my ocd didnt was indefinite. It went on as long as it wanted to. I swear it consumed at least 6 hours of my 12 hour days. I had the ocd that I had to go back to where I was when I had a bad thought, and make it a good thought or that bad thought would come true. Had no control over my thoughts. Anyway, my mother told me at a young age that I would most likely grow out of it. I have always tried to hold fast to that thought. Fast forward 20 years and I still have it but it's not nearly as bad. Therapists say that exposure therapy is the best way to go about it, though I do believe that to be true, I have not tried it myself. Best thing that I can suggest you try is making sure your personal living area is clean and organized to the best of your own ability. Trying to stay calm, getting a book you enjoy oh, nice cup of tea or coffee, and taking time to yourself starting the day. Give yourself the confidence that you can and WILL get better. This is only temporary. You got this!!!!"
