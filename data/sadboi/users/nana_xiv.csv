funny,fpdz74e,t1_fpdashk,1588537177.0,"Just in case you actually are having trouble understanding the situation: OP did not invite you to comment on her body, and as long as she doesn't do that, these comments - especially about her chest! - are not welcome.  We live in an age where basically unlimited amounts of porn are available to you, you can go look  at and comment on that any time. Commenting on women's bodies who are just trying to have a good time accomplishes nothing and only adds to heaps of trauma and insecurities many of us already have. Just doesn't make the world a better place, you know?"

I'm looking up the Youtube trailer at work right now and the tiger really sounds like Smaug, but you're saying he's not even Benedict Cumberbatch? Honestly, thanks!! This is great"
PhilosophyTube,fk258kq,t1_fk24eo6,1583793421.0,"Thank you SO much for this beautiful comment - there's nothing like learning about an artist from someone who is excited about their art. If I see her books somewhere some day, there's no way I'll walk past them now :)"
