ExteriorDesign,fr1qqfk,t3_gm4kt3,1589824338.0,"Well the first thing I'd do is fix those bay windows on the front of the house by putting in real ones. These are out of scale. They need to reach all the way down to the bottom of the shutters and need to have proper shutters for the bay windows on them. Those things are just - hanging there. It's not right.

And the porch pediment and pillars are underscaled - they need to be scaled up. In fact, I'd consider a two-storey porch with a balcony up top and change out that window over the front door to a balcony door.

Vinyl siding is icky, but, probably covering it with better siding is a better solution to landfills. OTOH - getting rid of entirely and going with a cement board siding gives you better fire insurance rates.  And maybe instead of shutters beefing up the exterior window and door trims to give is some interest.

The garage door is just a big white blob. Maybe a faux-paint job with a wood-grain that goes nicely with the brick and the new siding, or, a new garage door that goes with the brick.  


On the back of the house what about a 2-storey porch that can be screened in in summer and glassed in in winter? And put in some real windows, to proper scale across the back facade so you can get more light into the house from that direction?"

This is one of our doctors in Brooklyn, NY, Dr. Cameron Kyle Sidell,  at one of our epicenters - his specialties are Emergency Medicine and Critical Care. He is saying that in the last 9 days what he is seeing is that the COVID patients who develop this covid-induced ARDS  are presenting  more like high-altitude sickness - it's oxygen failure - not muscle failure from exhaustion. So he's saying they're going to have to re-calibrate the vents to treat for oxygen failure not exhaustion of the breathing muscles themselves. Which makes sense since this virus seems to like to kick the iron out of red blood cells.

Here's the video followed by his credential and contact information I found for him. I hope this helps anyone.

A. Stephenson's Apple Tree Inn Frozen Fruit Salad. The original recipe always had chopped marshmallows I think but Mom always left them out because we kept picking them out. And we liked the halved marschino cherries rather than pieces.

Ingredients:

1 pkg package softened cream cheese

* 1/3 cup mayonnaise
* 1 Tsp lemon juice
* 2 egg whites
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 1 cup whipping cream
* 1/4 cup drained mandarin orange slices
* 1 lb can fruit cocktail, drained
* 1/4 cup maraschino cherries
* 1/4 cup chopped walnuts

## Prep

Blend cheese, mayonnaise, lemon juice. Beat egg whites until foamy. Beat in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, until stiff peaks form. Beat cream until stiff. Fold cream into egg whites. Fold into cheese mixture. Fold into rest of ingredients. Pour into 8-inch square pan. Freeze

B. Jello Beet Salad   

Ingredients  
 2 sm. pkgs. lemon Jello (you can substitute cherry or strawberry too but we liked lemon)  
2 whole cans shredded beets  
1 (No. 2) can crushed pineapple  
1 (No. 2) can pineapple tidbits   


Prep  


Drain all the cans into one measuring cup and add enough hot water to make 4 cups of liquid.  Stir in your Jello and when it's cooled add the ingredients from the cans stir and let set up in the fridge.  


Dressing: 1/3 cup mayo with horseraadish mixed in to taste - but you want a little heat. You can also add an equal amount of sour cream to the mayo & horseradish if you like.

Serve on a lettuce leaf with a dollop of the dressing.

It's actually quite good and refreshing on a hot Summer day in the MidWest."

**A renowned research professor in France has reported successful results from a new treatment for Covid-19, with early tests suggesting it can stop the virus from being contagious in just six days.**

Professor Didier Raoult from infection hospital l'Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire (IHU) Méditerranée Infection in Marseille (Bouches-du-Rhône, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur), [**published a video**](https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/coronavirus-diagnostiquons-et-traitons-premiers-resultats-pour-la-chloroquine/%20)    
 ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4J8kydOvbc&feature=emb\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4J8kydOvbc&feature=emb_logo) )  explaining the trials on Monday March 16.

Professor Raoult is an infectious diseases specialist and head of the IHU Méditerranée Infection, who has been tasked by - and consulted by - the French government to research possible treatments of Covid-19.

He said that the first Covid-19 patients he had treated with the drug chloroquine had seen a rapid and effective speeding up of their healing process, and a sharp decrease in the amount of time they remained contagious.

Chloroquine - which is normally used mainly to prevent and treat malaria - was administered via the named drug, Plaquenil.

The treatment was offered to 24 patients, who were among the first to become infected in the south east of France, and who had voluntarily admitted themselves to hospital for the process.

Patients were given 600mcg per day for 10 days. They were closely monitored, as the drug can interact with other medication, and cause severe side effects in some cases.

Professor Raoult said: “We included everyone who was in agreement \[to be treated\], which was almost everyone. Two towns in the protocol, Nice and Avignon, gave us \[infected\] patients who had not yet received treatment.

“We were able to ascertain that patients who had not received Plaquenil (the drug containing hydroxychloroquine) were still contagious after six days, but of those that had received Plaquenil, after six days, only 25% were still contagious.”

Chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine have previously been used to treat coronavirus patients in China, in ongoing Covid-19 clinical trials.

Kaletra, a US-based antiviral drug normally used to treat HIV, is another medicine that is being tested in the fight against Covid-19.

#### US academic study concurs

A new academic study, published on Friday March 13 by US scientific researchers, also said that chloroquine appeared to be an effective treatment, and appears to align with the findings in France.

It said: “Use of chloroquine (tablets) is showing favorable outcomes in humans infected with Coronavirus including faster time to recovery and shorter hospital stay…

“Research shows that chloroquine also has strong potential as a prophylactic (preventative) measure against coronavirus in the lab, while we wait for a vaccine to be developed.

“Chloroquine is an inexpensive, globally available drug that has been in widespread human use since 1945 against malaria, autoimmune and various other conditions…\[it\] can be prescribed to adults and children of all ages.

""It can also be safely taken by pregnant women and nursing mothers \[and\] has been widely used to treat human diseases, such as malaria, amoebiosis, HIV, and autoimmune diseases, without significant detrimental side effects.”

Researchers worldwide are continuing to work on developing a vaccine against Covid-19.""
