Unfortunately, Guatemala has had a significant upswing in the past 3 days with 85 new cases today. The positivity rate of testing a few weeks ago suggested testing wasn't too bad. Total number of tests for today wasn't released this evening but if it's anything like the past two days Guatemala's positivity rate is now over 10 percent which probably suggests undertesting.

> The country is experiencing the most coronavirus contagion period since the emergency began, on Sunday President Alejandro Giamattei confirmed 85 new positive cases.

> The representative in the presidential message reiterated that ""the most critical weeks"" of the emergency are being experienced and statistical data support Giamattei's justification because the upward curve is marked.

> Giamattei explained that of the new cases 57 male patients and 28 are women. There are currently 914 active cases and 26 are deceased.

> In addition, the ruler stated that there are six new patients recovered and two deaths were recorded.

> ""This critical period of the disease is reflected that everything we have done to this day has served us to arrive in the way we did: few cases - a thousand 52 infected - and few dead - there are 26 deaths,"" Giamattei justified.

> The president urged citizens to maintain social estrangement ""to attend to the provisions and ensure that others do, we have to wear a mask and wash our hands with soap and water, or alcohol.""

> The president during the message to the public justified the widening of the restrictions ""in view of the increase in cases being in the week critical, and that we have noticed some social relaxation that has been perceived in some sectors"".

> The interdepartmental traffic restriction is set at the national level.

> Markets will be closed if social estrangement is not implemented.

> Shopping centers will be sanctioned by the Consumer Care and Assistance Directorate for partially enabling areas of its facilities.

> Hospitals that do not report coronavirus cases and violate protocols will be criminally sanctioned and reported.

_Thus, as expected, increased mortality was observed

It's possible (likely) that the increase in mortality seen in individuals in the HCQ/AZT is simply because they had a more severe presentation of the disease. It could be that HCQ/AZT caused harm. It could be that HCQ/AZT in fact was helpful. We really can't tell.

Imagine if 11,000 extra people died in six weeks in Miami Dade alone. That's what happened in Guayas a province of 3 million prople. Same size. The death rate was probably much higher than the US because it was a total collapse. But it's still a big outbreak. The number is from a Financial Times analysis.

[Here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/04/03/americas/guayaquil-ecuador-overwhelmed-coronavirus-intl/index.html) is a CNN article from over a month ago with some video. A lot of people think Latin America hasn't had much of a problem. Or at least not until Brazil. But it's just not true. Most of the coverage of Latin America is in Spanish and just isn't covered well in the US.

Watch Santa Cruz, Bolivia over the next month. Bolivia has been under a total quarantine for like 2 months. And I mean total in a way that wouldn't be possible in the US. Santa Cruz has been in martial law for several weeks because it's still spreading. Santa Cruz isn't Miami hot but it's hot. Personally, I think they may be fucked in the next month. But, the altiplano? La Paz, Cochabamba, Oruro... They are OK. And Oruro and La Paz see freezing temperatures sometimes. It's cold.

I'd also point out that even despite heroic lockdowns that would be unacceptably harsh in the US the disease is in fact spreading in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. In Guatemala it's been in the cooler areas but there is no place that is cold this time of year. That's just where a lot of people live.

So we can definitely say that warm weather isn't, in and of itself, going to stop coronavirus.

El Salvador -- officially has 555 cases but the president just warned of a collapse of the health system in a couple of weeks. I think he commented that there is a lot of transmission they aren't seeing. They have had strict social distancing rules but people aren't flowing them well.

The rest of the country is in curfew except people may leave for food based on an assigned day depending on their ID number. That's how they are slowing this. There are/have been strict movement restrictions with checkpoits. Honduras is very poor. Their health system is ranked one of the lowest in the hemisphere.  Plus they are battling the largest Dengue outbreak since they started taking records in 1980. They know if it get loose they are fucked and are taking pretty extreme measures.

Nicaragua -- 15 cases. 5 deaths. They are the most in denial country in the hemisphere. No testing no problem. As of a week ago there were no restrictions. Business as usual. It's possible a month from now Nicaragua is one big Guayas. I haven't paid attention to Nicaragua in a week. Got some contacts there and really should enquire.

Bolivia -- 24 hour curfew that you can break once per week depending on the number on your cédula. People in Santa Cruz weren't following the rules, it spread, so they had to get even more strict. Although I don't know what that is. Been probably 2 weeks since I heard much about Bolivia.

Guatemala -- I'm a US citizen in Guatemala and they have been doing as well as anyone. Restrictions are tight. Some departmental borders are closed. Checkpoints. Some towns are closed. No public transportation -- which is basically like shutting down the Interstate in the US. It's critical. Many businesses closed. Public markets are much, much smaller. 10-12 hour curfew. The will arrest you.  Fine for not wearing a mask. It's been slowed down through extreme measure. Americans back home would cry like selfish children. It's extreme by US standards. None the less, it sounds like we just had 1 month of cryptic transmission in Huehuetenango and a large outbreak in Zacapa that they are going to hit hard with test and trace."
Coronavirus,fpinc7n,t1_fpildco,1588644512.0,"It has typos and says ""draft"" and you get downvoted for suggesting a ""grain of salt""? The numbers may very well be correct (and seem reasonable) but with grain of salt is exactly how we should take this."
Coronavirus,fpim8ud,t1_fpihoe7,1588643843.0,Good for Social Security. Bad for Medicare.
Coronavirus,fpilv0a,t1_fpijeco,1588643611.0,"The original model was based on the assumption we would lockdown hard. It said so at the _very top_ of the model. In the notes it specifically referenced locking down until there was 1 case per million. Wuhan style. 

We aren't doing that. We are trying something different. The US isn't going back into containment.

So they changed the model. The new model had been regression tested and attempts to predict what will happen in the much more complicated situation we are now in.

We shall see."
Coronavirus,fpi3ghq,t1_fphw6ph,1588632912.0,They have changed this. Take a look at the change notes. It's effectively a new model.
Coronavirus,fpi39va,t1_fphsgkl,1588632809.0,"Yes, the original was intended primarily to model the peak. They have changed it significantly to model further into the future."
Coronavirus,fphv11i,t1_fphs3pc,1588628317.0,What specifically did he say about masks that was a lie. Can you give me a quote with context?
Coronavirus,fphqnx3,t1_fphq9x1,1588626031.0,"Again, just looking for examples. 🤷🏼‍♂️"
Coronavirus,fphpi9p,t1_fphp69k,1588625421.0,I'm just looking for examples. You are the first person I've run into on Reddit that has suggested Trudeau was lying about COVID. The few briefings of his I've watched and the quotes in the press have always seen quite rational. I don't understand much of Canada's internal politics -- especially who is getting what money and why -- but he generally seems to talk science.
Coronavirus,fphoscm,t1_fpholhe,1588625054.0,"That's it? Man, what a lying scumbag. /S"
Coronavirus,fpho5m1,t1_fphmjt7,1588624731.0,But what are his calculated lies about COVID?
Coronavirus,fphnyzq,t1_fphmxnl,1588624637.0,"Oh, yeah. My bad and thanks for the correction."
Coronavirus,fphlf5c,t1_fphkns8,1588623340.0,"Ah, thank you for that link. I've been meaning to listen to the IHME podcast episode."
Coronavirus,fphl90h,t1_fphkprz,1588623255.0,Is there another you prefer? Maybe one that relies on epidemiological data?
Coronavirus,fphki7u,t1_fphjt4x,1588622879.0,But what calculated lies about coronavirus has he made? Like like top 5.
Coronavirus,fphkd06,t1_fphjvqs,1588622807.0,"Assuming a faster downslope than is happening is just another way of saying they assume a full lockdown, isn't it? That's a stated assumption of the model."
