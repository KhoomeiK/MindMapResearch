makeupartists,fe6297d,t3_ejprdy,1578880159.0,"I've been a PMA for 26  years.  I was a trainer for a major cosmetic company  and now own my salon. The best advice I can give you, if you are getting started, is to work part or full time at a cosmetic counter.  You will have many different faces, skin tones and textures to work on in a short amount of time.  All lines have their own training programs as well.  Spend a year behind a counter and you will have a great start.  You will learn what you enjoy, what you want to focus on and more importantly what you don't like.  It will also help you make connections in the industry.  Many different paths will open and you will find your niche.  It's an amazingly creative and fulfilling atmosphere.  Enjoy your journey!"

AskReddit,f1utz90,t3_dap9i1,1569763667.0,"I was raped when I was 19 at a KOA. My parents didn't want me to camp there. My family and church would talk about women and how the way we dressed and acted would lead to things like this. They were very harsh on victims of rape, saying they were probably asking for it. When the Kavanaugh scandal broke they were awful. She was obviously just trying to ruin his life, and now his family are the victims.  My political and religious beliefs are 100% different. So the arguments are still frequent, especially with all the current shit going on in the White House. I almost broke. I almost told them everything just to see the look on thier faces when they realized that it happened to me. I ended up not doing it because I didn't want to see the pain on my dad's face. He is a good man and we are very close. I didn't want his opinion of me to change. I've been married for 20 years. My husband knows everything and has helped me deal with it. At this point it would just cause unneeded pain to those I love. Although they are ignorant and backwards in their thinking, i can't think of any good reason to bring it up now."

I know that no matter what, I will always have a place to sleep and food to eat.  I think you are right.  I do tend to isolate myself when feeling this way.  I guess maybe I think it keeps me from having to pretend to be okay when I'm around others.  I always feel like I have to be up beat and positive around people.  I don't want anyone else to see my pain and treat me differently.  I have an irrational fear that I will be perceived as weak.  I fear that I will loose respect from my employees and those who are around me frequently.  It sounds stupid typing it out.  I know it shouldn't matter what other people think.
