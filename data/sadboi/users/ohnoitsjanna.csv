PSLF,fegn6b7,t3_ep25uh,1579097773.0,"New-ish dentist here, 2017 grad. I've been working at a qualified PSLF job for 1.5 years now. I currently don't regret my decision to work at an FQHC for loan repayment though I have thought long and hard about this decision myself. Through my experience so far, I have learned that I very much appreciate the low-stress environment and the benefits are unbeatable. Working in public health is a great way to work on your speed and skill set, communication, confidence, and spend any down time learning about practice management. Dig into insurances, real estate, billing, leadership, handling conflict/angry patients/angry staff etc. Once you begin, you will realize there is a lot that goes into a successful private practice. Figure out what procedures you really like and if private practice is really what you want for yourself. Also, although we are not aggressively paying down our dental school loans -- we have the ability to contribute max $$ to our retirements (with match included) which IMO is valuable at this stage of our lives (compounding interest). Lastly, I hope to start a family soon and the flexibility with our sick/vacation time makes this process a lot more stress-free. My end goal is to open up my own private practice someday as well, OP. We may not be placing implants, but those skills can always be learned and by those 10 years we will have a different skill set  to bring to the table in private practice. 

I hope this helps you with your indecision-- I did not have anyone to consult when I made my decision. My biggest recommendation is to evaluate your needs and look at the big picture. If you ever want to connect, please feel free to DM me. I am always looking for other dentists who are going through the PSLF process! :)"

You need 120 payments and some people haven't jumped through the hoops and they have been very bad helping people get the forgiveness. But my thinking is we'll be in a different place in 10 years and if she has to work make pay

Check out /r/PSLF they have some good information for you there and you can ask whatever questions you have about the program. A majority of the exaggerated PR and denied applications were because people were not following the simple rules. If you proceed with PSLF just be diligent and check in and you should get forgiveness as long as you meet all of their requirements. Good luck to you and your situation OP, you are a good man."
