Try and make some new friends and maybe in the future if you ever want to have a get together you can invite everyone and you won’t be stuck conversating with just the one group of friends.  You are getting older and it is normal for some to grow apart. I’m 36 and I have a bf from 7th grade.

Also another thing. I had a boy rabbit that was not fixed and it would hump different stuffed animals it had, those stuffed animals smelled disgusting like the worst body odor."
Rabbits,fojb6ny,t3_g7s6jx,1587815420.0,The itinerary does smell very pungent. But if you clean it every two or three days it won’t be bad. You should consider no small cage and get the rabbit a litter box. They automatically use the box. But remember that rabbit poop is little balls and no matter what when the rabbit jumps out of the litter box little poops will end up on your floor because they get stuck on the rabbits feet etc.

depression,fh41xnv,t1_fe4ctbd,1581274400.0,"I have felt like this off and on since I was very young. I’m mid 30’s now. 
The best thing I ever did was enter an intensive outpatient program for my depression ( feeling of nothing.) I went 4 times a week for two hours each time. It was group therapy. 
Since you’re not an adult you should talk to your parents about it. They poke fun trying to get a reaction from you because you are missed and you mean a lot to them. 
It’s the worst feeling to be isolated and numb. But it is in your head. Your brain is lacking a chemical. 
My second thing that helps me is to force myself to go outside and walk around. I like to take my dog. He makes me at ease and is a bridge between me and others in a way. 

The way that you have described yourself feels so familiar to me. 

Once you find purpose you will find happiness. 
But at least start with some sunshine."
