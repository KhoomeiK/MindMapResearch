“Half Right, FACE”
“Front Lean and Rest Position, MOVE!”

One jackass took his time getting down...

“Get up!”
“Get down!”

Asshole Jamaican dude (fact, not racist) in front of me, who was why we were playing these fuck fuck games, kept inching backwards to me. I kept trying to whisper to move forward. He was stupid. What turned out to be the last, “Get down!”, ended in my getting kicked just below the eye. I’m pissed. We push. Then the DS isn’t done so he never orders, “RECOVER!”. We remain in the Front Lean and Rest position. Something is tickling my skin. My head drops down and blood 🩸 drips onto the pavement, then begins to pour. We recover and I’m completely covered in my blood, down my neck and into my brown t-shirt. DS notices immediately and freaks the fuck out! He’s screaming at the moron. I’m sent to the back of the formation to be checked out by our Jr DS. I tell him what happened, asks me if I needed medical and I declined. “I can see boot polish in the cut, when we get back to the barracks you HAVE to get that out.” Lazy ass wouldn’t even get the clumps of Kiwi out of the crevice in the boot sole! We go back and ALL we were allowed to have was Isopropyl Alcohol. I had to have two guys take turns digging that douche bags boot polish from my cut using only Q-Tips and Isopropyl Alcohol! 

Until my face healed I was pulled out of formation by EVERY officer and Senior NCO that passed by. My DS (junior one) and I knew before the officer/SNCO did that we needed to fall out. Our Senior DS kept marching the formation like this was normal (because by then it was).

Uniforms can be, black non-slip shoes (like what most entry jobs require), khaki pants/shorts and a shirt. The point of the ‘uniform’ is NOT to pretend to look like the military, but to look like each other, Including brand!

Veterans,fpgyxj2,t3_gda9a6,1588611994.0,"I say, “Save a kid, screw a recruiter!”

I was in the Army and then the Navy. Teach them about jobs (MOS’s/Rates), what they ACTUALLY do, what they teach you and how it translates to the civilian world. One of my favorites was from the Navy, Hull Technician (HT). The recruiter sells the rate as being a “welder”. They are confused about why there was no welding in the A school and why they are called ‘turd chasers’. Then they get to the boat. They are basically Plumbers Apprentices for their career. Most ships are small so the welding billet goes to a First Class, HT1 (E-6). Even on a carrier, a Seamen (E-3) isn’t going to learn welding. They get out after 4 years and would have been better off going to a vocational school in the long run. There are more examples, that one just always stuck out to me.How many times did you say or hear, “if I knew then what I know now...” or, “if I ran into my recruiter...”? 

I think knowing the actual jobs and what they ACTUALLY translate to in the civilian world would arm the young men and women with important knowledge! 

That’s my opinion. It’s not ROTC-like, but I think that is more important to learn than ‘military bearing’, that’s what boot camp is for. I also saw a few responses about camping, knots, etc. That’s the Boy Scouts. Any camping I did in the Army or Navy, had nothing to do with the Army or Navy! Only Boatswains Mates or Parachute Riggers need to know knots and that brings us back to my original point, know what the job translates to in the civilian world. PR’s are who you bring your uniforms to after you get promoted to sew on your new rank. 

Some people want to do those jobs, bravo! If you are 21yo and want to prove yourself, to yourself, you may want to join ‘Special Forces’. The ’cool’ movies aren’t like reality and reality is boring, mind numbing, filled with “that’s not my job?!?”.

whittling,fpguce6,t3_gd7uc7,1588609662.0,"I did small boats years ago and I would add a Mainsail and working rudder. That will teach you a lot! I would make a sail out of pieces of canvas that I would soak in tea (for coloring) and when it was dry, I would rig it up to the yard arm and main mast. Then, I would use liquid starch to mold the sail to look like it (the boat) was under sail. I wish I could show examples, but years ago my toddler knocked them off of my dresser while I was deployed and our dog thought they were a new chew toy...."

PandemicPreps,fpd6dhq,t1_fpbagx0,1588520771.0,"I would like a new wife. I’ve always kept plenty of dry goods and water on hand. I would slowly add more cans and pasta, etc. When this whole thing started and I saw all of the aisles in the stores empty of bread, pasta, flour..., I chuckled to myself. I came home and moved my preps into the kitchen, in one area. 

“Where’s all of my flour?” I better look again, I must have missed something... No flour. ‘Wife’, why can’t I find where all of my flour that I stored, have you seen it?”

“Oh, yeah. We’re almost out.”

I can’t comprehend what she was saying! Turns out that she is SO lazy, that she kept filling her flour container up with my stored flour and NEVER mentioned to me that she was using it all up. I’m still pissed... now you can’t find flour or yeast. F that, Nevermind.


Addition: Thanks for all of the downvotes... I guess everyone has a great relationship with their SO and NONE of you have been/or in the midst of a divorce. I guess I’m the outlier."

NewSkaters,fp9phji,t3_gbwozy,1588431778.0,"So I grew up skating street/vert and surfing. I gave my sons all of my old decks. I could never verbally explain to them how to do tricks. I would end up showing them and after NOT doing it for a long time I would usually hurt myself (hence the reason I gave them all my decks). About a year ago, I bought a longboard and love it. As a civilian if I get hurt now I don’t get paid... I’m also 44 and between all of the injuries I’ve had growing up skating and in the 13 years in the military, I’ve got to take it slower!
