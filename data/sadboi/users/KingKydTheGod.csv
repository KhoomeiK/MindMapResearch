I'm a madman

I have lost my mind in loneliness,


My life is my own personal hell, from my choices.

Joined the military to beat my loneliness, got married to keep it away. Had kids to solidify the need to never be alone...

Yet one day, I panicked, I overreacted, I ran away from everything and everyone.

Even got my face tatted...alot...


I was lost in this world, not from outside influence, from my own personal fears and battling my own demons.


Today, here and now, I have a new girl, my x and I are okay, and my kids are apart of my life.


I recovered, and now my girl lost her mom, lost her cousin all in the last month.

I had no idea how to be there for her, but it turns out I didn't need an idea, all I needed was to just be available, and listen.


Of course I can't sum up the last 10 years of horrible and good things in a comment, but I can say this.


Whatever you do in this life, YOU OWN IT.

It doesn't matter if it was a good choice or bad, you take FULL ownership of anything you do.

Make no excuse. 


You fail, YOU OWN IT.


You win, YOU OWN IT.


Your rambling, is a form of mediation, understanding and becoming aware of yourself.
