Honestly, changing schedules every 1 to 3 months doesn't sound all that bad from my perspective. I think it would be more hectic if you were changing schedules every week. Plus it sounds like everything else about the job is pretty positive so I'd say go for it!

That being said, most of the singles they've released from their next album have been pretty good.
