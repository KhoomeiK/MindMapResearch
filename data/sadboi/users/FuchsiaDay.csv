Those groups turn ugly because there are the religious and the non-religious.  The religious are usually the ones making things unbearable.  If you are in multi minority groups, you are a sitting duck.  LGBs I see are getting divided because of views on bisexuality, and they also get divided via race.

I go on Youtube and pick out a Leslie Sansone walking video that is about 15 minutes and do that first.  I use those particular videos because it's not just walking (kicks,  knee raises, kick backs), and there is a gradual warming of the body.  Then I'm ready to go.  I stretch extra after too.

Everyone's body is different, and when I first started doing Jillian's stuff, I would get upset because I was having a hard time because I was so tight that I was expending extra energy just in the warm up and a host of other things.  I wanted to do it exactly like her.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""it's your own fault"" but everyone makes mistakes.  Just do what you have to do and start over a fresh. I know that is easy to say but hard to do, but don't beat yourself up.

Struggling doesn't an end date when it comes to disorders.  You have good days and bad days. On the good you do as much as you can. On the bad you cope and reach out.

One thing mental disorders (yes that includes EDs) is tell us negative stuff about ourselves. You are not a waste of time and resources.  You are a person who is having a hard time. That is ok.

So stay in bed the weekend.  Take it easy on yourself. Be nice to yourself.  Do things that you like to do if you can.

You are not a burden. You are a human being that's having a hard time.  It's ok, and you're ok.
