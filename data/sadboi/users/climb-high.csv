It's possible. Long story inbound: I spoke with someone who had a cadaver vein replace his damaged, scarred, narrowed, occluded subclavian vein. He basically had to ""shop"" around for vascular surgeons who also saw it necessary for him. He had upper extremity effort-DVT from rock climbing (the exact same pathology as me), but didn't get any relief after his first rib resection decompression surgery. It has taken me 9 months, but my collateral veins have compensated enough for my shitty subclavian vein, so I generally feel normal. The guy I spoke with said he never felt asymptomatic until the vein was fully ""replaced,"" so I think it was a quality of life issue. He reports being stronger than ever in normal life and rock climbing. He said the recovery was extremely difficult, took many months and was much worse than the first rib removal. 

I brought this up to my surgeon, just to pick his brain about my chronic DVT/narrowed vein. He laughed at the idea, because it is so extreme, and very medically unnecessary for me. I still struggle with a ""heavy"" arm with popped out collateral veins after exertion, but medically it is ""benign.""

Thank you for the comment, it is reassuring!

The frozen blueberries I was eating have more vitamin K because of their smaller surface area. They have more skin (with vit k in it) per serving than larger berries. They are also much darker in deep purple/blue, which usually indicates high vitamin K. So changing to weak vitamin k plump fresh berries reduced my vit K intake enough to throw me out of therapeutic range :(

When they are canned, they are pressure cooked in water.

This literally extracts the water soluble FODMAP into the ""bean juice,"" so then it's left to you to drain the excess water and fully rinse the freshly opened canned lentils! 

I think you can use fresh/dry lentils if you let them soak in water for awhile first. I don't want to do that, frankly. So I get the cans!

Canned/drained/rinsed doesn't make much of a difference with other types of pulses and beans, and I think it is because black beans, for example, don't get roughed up and split open as much as lentils. I wish I could eat black beans and rice. Oh well!"
