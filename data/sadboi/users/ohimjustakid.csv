ArtistLounge,flptf7e,t1_flnqg6e,1585368305.0,"newbie here also wondered the same thing, heres kinda what i learned. the more of a beginner you are the more you should invest in learning/studying; however the actual practice/application time of what you learn should always exceed time spent studying. the experience/mileage is what you lack most and luckily is where you learn the most as you cement those skills. consistency helps greatly with this as well as just building the habit of wanting to create.

HOWEVER, unless youre super into what youre learning even as a beginner you should only spend half your time learning and the other half spent doing what sorta inspires you to learn. example, im studying andrew loomis right now with a daily routine of about 3 hours. i try to ensure that i read/note take and self critique based on my study ref for a good 30-45 mins, another 45 mins spent copying plates and lastly 30-60 mins of just painting portraits that i  actually want to paint. objectiveness, anaylsis & application"

dont give up! keep studying/practicing and aim towards a goal, like others have said marketing your art is better when your craft fills a niche. whether a physical print, cool online avatar, tshirt, ref/idea sheet or whatever, finding that interest you can fill with your art is how you market yourself and build a customer base. now that you have faced some failure your next step is learning from it"

so first thing that came to mind was your use of a symmetry tool, while it definitely has its use its not something you want to use when drawing people. instead you should learn how to construct heads using a method such as Andrew Loomis's; [example](https://imgur.com/a/uPXCGfC). 

its super tough to learn at first, but will help build a solid foundation and knowledge that will actually speed things up in the long run!

as a beginner i would also recommend you work almost exclusively from reference (photo, real life, 3d model etc) as building your observational skills first will really allow you to start drawing from imagination. sorry for the wall of text, if you need clarification or further resources just ask!"

 from there try reasoning through them, as you said in your post, working gives you a sense of accomplishment. so use that as a reminder for why YOU want to go (internal motivation as opposed to external social motivation) you might even benefit from a little physical reminder. it might sound a little silly but like a little poster, savings jar or a favorite quote/passage by youre bed can spark that motivation. sorry for rambling and best of luck out there"
