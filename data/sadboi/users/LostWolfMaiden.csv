I do not have a vest yet since my poodle was growing so fast, so I bought a neon green harness and I have two patches on his leash that say ""In training"" and ""do not pet"".

He loves to jump up on people right now, he's 7 months old so I can't blame him. I am, however, angry at the people who ignore every sign I could possibly put up without investing $50 in a vest every 2 months to come up to him.  It's infuriating when you still come up to us after I say ""he's a service dog in training, please dont pet him."" (Like this is an opener to a conversation or something??) or ""LEAVE IT.""

Pets,f8fvx94,t3_e0fam8,1574550107.0,"I can totally relate. When I was living with my best friend she and I went to the shelter to get her a kitten as a comfort animal. She could see how much I loved the presence of a cat so she and my boyfriend at the time surprised me with a trip to the shelter. My boy was the first kitten I picked up. He was so tiny and he looked so scared, but when I tried to hand him back he latched onto me and started crying. It felt like he was screaming at me and I couldn't say no, so I picked him. 

This cat decided his first mission in life was to understand doors. I had to barricade myself in my room at night, otherwise he would open every door in the house. We had come home from class to our cats on our front porch, so we had to baby lock our house. He constantly whines when he doesn't get what he wants and he hates new people, especially people I do not care for and will go out of his way to terrorize them until they leave or he gets in trouble.

I've had him for two years now and that has not changed. It took him a year to like my parents, and people who visit know to avoid him or get hit. I used to get really upset that he couldn't be friendlier, but now everyone's accepted that it's just his personality and they love him. He's extremely protective of my mental health and will not let anyone who upsets me into my room. 

I'm grateful he's my cat, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Sometimes I look at him and cry because I wonder what would have happened to him if I hadn't adopted him, if someone with less patience and love for his personality had taken him in and abandoned him. He can be a handful, but at the end of the day he is my best friend."

US politics has become a huge pissing contest with each other.

I have heard some absolutely disgusting things from people, but I have a hard time believing that there aren't people like Trump supporters everywhere in the world. The only reason they feel like it's okay is because Trump has opened a platform for them to do so.

Americans are constantly fighting a social battle with each other. I have lost relationships with family and friends over the radical ideas getting tossed around.

Much of what's reported on both sides are extremists because it gets views worldwide. It completely dilutes serious matters.

It doesn't help that social media filters out things that you would dislike. This allows for ""fake news"" to come from both sides because we aren't seeing the other side's point of view, or getting a full story most of the time and a majority are too busy or distracted to invest the time.

outerwilds,f523icl,t3_dmj1sa,1571946950.0,"I think the Sun Station is a huge piece of the story's weight.

We learn so much about the scientists that worked on the Sun Station and the ATP while on our adventures. We can see their hope and excitement for this project throughout, their ability to flex every fiber of Nomai knowledge, while simultaneously walking through the ruins that were left behind from their unknown demise.

If you read deeper into the logs, this is a civilization that is desperately looking for purpose and meaning. They threw themselves into the unknown thousands of years ago only to be ravaged by their environment and stranded. The children of the Nomai we know were driven by this goal so much so that they were willing to rip their home/prison apart.

We know Idaea and Pye built the sun station, Pye was for it, Idaea wasn't absolutely sold on the idea of the sun station. After its failure, Idaea became so depressed his sister had to check on him. He, who was morally conflicted on this project, felt such defeat in this failure he could not move forward. He never left the sun station, and you can find his body staring at the sun. I imagine he blamed himself for its failure, as Idaea came off more serious than his counterpart Pye.

Without the Sun Station, I'm not sure we would have a grasp of how desparate the Nomai were for some form of change or reason for what was happening to them. They NEEDED to find the eye, or everything they had been through was for nothing.

To me, it's another symbol of inevitability. All of the technology in the world, you will inevitably fail (Sun Station) and all of the preparation in the world, you will still die (after surviving the crash, only to be killed by the interloper.) All of the effort, for things to still happen their own way. Which is really what this game is about."

When I went out there, there was this grand staircase. It was like it was there, but wasnt. The outlines and shadows were like a rainbow/holographic. There were angels that slid down the railing and then danced back up to the top.  When I looked up, there was a man standing there who identified himself as Jesus.

I would chalk this up to being a dream, but I immediately ran to my mom, because what the fuck, and woke her up and told her. She told EVERYONE she knew. I don't know how to explain it, I don't know if it was really Jesus, I believe it actually happened, I can remember it vividly.

Side thing, I HATE insects, but watching ant farm videos fascinated me into liking ""domesticated"" ants, just food for thought."

Anxiety,f2f7ro9,t1_f2es9t9,1570212539.0,"I had thought about it earlier in the year, but then I would find myself sleeping more to fill in more of the blanks.  I worry about how much emphasis I put on my dreams, because I tend to overthink on them, dwelling on the details I remember. I've kept a dream journal, but I'm really bad at writing things down, I might try to pick it up again though!"
Anxiety,f2emlvj,t1_f2ekgt8,1570199254.0,"It depends on the day/theme of the dream. There are several ""maps"" in my dream and sometimes ways to pass between them, some ""maps"" have changed or merged. Depending on my reason for being there, I can either wake up refreshed or panicked. Some that really fucked me up:

-there is a mall setting, but the mall is in the middle of a desert. (Note: i had to take medical leave from college. Though my best friend and I would travel far to mall crawl occasionally, the nearest was 2 hours away from our college town.) I can remember one time dreaming about getting donuts with her at the mall, despite her being 4 hours away. It was hard to feel like I hadnt just seen her.

-I came to the conclusion that the elevators in this world are sentient and often do not listen, so it was better for my health to avoid them. I dont have a fear of elevators at all (I actually prefer taking them) but over the course of a dream the buttons would stop going where they're supposed to, but instead it would go to awful rooms, levels, situations that would cause me to panic when awake.

-flying is cool, but really terrifying because it usually means it's a space dream, and theres some wonky shit happening to space there. Space dreams are the most memorable though because I wanted to apply for the astronaut program before my anxiety became disabling.

But yeah :D that's some of my Otherside.

Bonus: there is this cookie shop down the street in my dreams. It has literally never existed IRL, but they switched to a medical marijuana edible shop recently (I just got my medical card a few months ago) so that may be why. 

Also my SDiT Atlas has a hard time appearing and tends to be a grounding technique for intense situations because he isnt there therefore this isn't real EXCEPT this one time I was being chased and hiding out on a roof, grounding, and he appeared and started barking so theres that."
Anxiety,f2e058f,t1_f2dtbet,1570172959.0,"This (kinda) happened to me for a month. I went into panic mode and couldn't get out. Ended up sedating myself for most of January, into February before I was able to exist again. I ended up developing an intensely real and complex dream world, sometimes it's nice, other times it really fucks me up. It's so detailed I have triggers in the dream world and abide by certain rules. The minds defence mechanisms are craaaazy"
outerwilds,f28s1rd,t1_f27wgtp,1570069267.0,It could be like a pop-up event. Pick a planet and bring everyone there? We dont know because traditional Nomai culture were lost to those in our star system. I wish towards the end you could write a message back. I feel like reading text of them freaking out because they got a message from the vessel would be insane.

AskReddit,f1r875p,t3_dafj6x,1569712376.0,"My dream job has always been to go to space, despite the fact I've always been an anxious person. Because of this goal, I had refused to ever see a mental health professional for my anxiety/trauma. I double majored in Physics and Computer Science right out of high school and moved away from home. 

A series of really poor decisions and some bad luck and a few bad college heartbreaks later, my anxiety developed into a full blown panic disorder and I've become severely agoraphobic. I had to take a medical leave, and move back home where I'm wrapping up maybe 18 credits. I don't think I'll get to be an astronaut."

She didnt have any malicious body language, but that of someone who sees what you don't. I think she didnt want to flat out be like, think about what you're here for, why you like him, what he offers but she tried to push Rebecca to think about it. When Rebecca couldnt think of an answer she didnt laugh or get angry, she just did what a parent would do, kept a static face and went back to cooking. I think she's worried Zied would get stranded in America."

On top of that I feel like the sit-down with Darcy, Stacy was trying to suck up her pride and be real with her sister.

service_dogs,ey8qofi,t3_cw62di,1566926139.0,"I had (have) a really hard time finding the right trainer in my area. There are several that ""specialize"" in SD training or do some form of SD training. Every place either had mixed reviews or over the phone it just felt wrong. 

I was initially looking for someone to help with the entire process down to picking my prospect. I called/emailed roughly 15-20 trainers and behaviorists but all of them pretty much brushed it aside. I ended up relying entirely on the breeders' opinions on their dogs. Any time I found a breeder I would drop questions about their litters (if they already were born) or on the parents' temperaments. Going off of a basic temprament test, i told them what i was looking for in a dog. If the breeder ever felt impatient or annoyed or couldn't answer the questions I asked I would immediately take them off the table. Picking up my prospect, I tried to temprament test him to the best of my ability.

I didn't find a SD trainer that I liked in my area so Atlas and I have been improvising. He's 5 months old and we've been going to the same trainer for his puppy classes since he was 12 weeks. Though she herself doesnt train service dogs, she knows a few trainers who do and is working with me to help find the right trainer and offered to talk to a few SD trainers that she knows who might be willing to work with me. I don't know how it's going to work out, but it's been my best option rather than sending him in blind. 

In my case, my puppy's basic training needs became a great way to network. What's nice about his puppy classes is I'm there. I can see my trainers methods and agree or disagree with the progress. I trust my trainer and I know that she wouldn't send me to someone who would hurt my dog. In the meantime, we have our backup plan of lessons that are easily available: puppy classes (just graduated :D), more advanced puppy classes, manners, CGC, and therapy dog classes to help solidify training."
