I would sit down with your son and talk to him about it..apologise and say you understand that you have been too harsh in the past but only did it because you thought you were doing the right thing, and that you are going to try and change. This will also make your son have a lot of respect for you, it's hard to admit you are wrong, by especially to admit that to your child and he will definitely appreciate it. Make sure you read up on ways to enforce rules and discipline without being too harsh and shouting and explain these things to both your wife and son. 
You all need to be on the same wavelength and find something that works for all of you. 
I find time outs, deducting pocket money/toys/screen time for breaking rules or being rude etc work really well. You just need to be consistent and the rules/boundaries/consequences are clear to your son. It can be hard at the start (I had to completely change my way if doing things after my husband passed away and I was solely responsible for a 2 and 7 year old) especially when they will be testing you like crazy, so again, consistency is key to it working. Don't hold grudges or bring things up that have been dealt with either.

Another thing that is really important is to have rewards for when he is good so he will more willing to do it. 

Maybe you should have a dad/son activity or hobby that only you two do together to try and repair any damage that may have been done to your relationship?

FriendshipAdvice,f5147rf,t3_dmief5,1571936970.0,"Nothing mate, you've gone about it the right way by the sounds of it and your friend is just being childish and having a tantrum cus you said something he didn't like. Either he will cool off and realise he was being an idiot or you've just saved yourself having a petty and embarrassing friend!"
FriendshipAdvice,f506po8,t3_dmd010,1571922829.0,"Sad as it is, it sounds like the friendship has come to a natural end. It may be that she is suffering from mental health issues (depression, anxiety) which you cannot help her with if she won't talk to you or let you in, but if she's that closed off and has been for some years then it definitely seems like a good time to just stop. She isn't making the effort either so it's not like she's fighting for your attention, doesn't seem worth the effort in my opinion!"

CatAdvice,f4mo3ln,t1_f4lysds,1571680649.0,"So sorry for your loss! 
Currently in the same situation. My 5yo cat passed away 2 months ago and my 8yo didn't stop following me and meowing for weeks, he still is alot more affectionate than he ever was before. I wasn't sure about getting a new cat at first but decided he needed a friend now and it was time to do so. We are picking up a tabby kitten in 4 weeks. Don't know gender yet but I'm hoping because they are so young it shouldn't make a difference! 
Good luck"

FriendshipAdvice,f4ey8cw,t3_dk8s1k,1571564412.0,"Maybe you should talk to him rather than to other friends about the situation? He's essentially found out you were being mean about him behind his back and is naturally going to be upset and hurt about that. 
It doesn't seem worth throwing a friendship away over, you are at an age where people are finding themselves and taking a lot from what they see in other people. This may well be a phase for him that he will grow out if. Especially if he has a close friend who will put him in his place when he is out of line or taking things too far. Don't give up on him, just explain to him how his actions are bothering you. 
He will thank you for it later in life, regardless of whether you drift apart or sort your differences and remain solid"

Also, if your brother does ever try to commit suicide over this, it is NOT your fault or responsibility. The only person who can commit suicide is that person and if he did it over what he did to you, then that is his own fault!"

FriendshipAdvice,f36pg9s,t1_f36jx81,1570715713.0,"I wouldn't say anything for now unless your wife has asked you to. I 100% sympathise with her and understand why this would hurt her feelings, but for now it's a one off (aside from wedding related times) and it may be that it doesn't happen again. Your wife should let them know in this instance, if they are true friends they will understand and be  more considerate in the future. 
If it gets to the point that you should get involved it may be that she is better off without them. It's hard if you don't have other friends to turn to, but over time she will make other friends naturally through work/kids etc. It's a horrible thing to have to go through, but she will be glad she did in the future. Hopefully it won't come to that though!"
