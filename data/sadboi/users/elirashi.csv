lonely,ewut32p,t3_cq2n5f,1565790998.0,me looll I’ve never dated so I always wonder how it feels like to be doing these things with someone who has mutual feelings for me
Crushes,ewus4e0,t3_cq1ocb,1565790324.0,Sometimes having crushes makes me miserable but at the same time I enjoyed how it made me miserable lol makes me feel alive idk how to explain

dating_advice,ev2wqg8,t1_ev0q9kk,1564185059.0,this comment really put my thoughts at peace omg but it’s so hard to actually commit to it for awhile because I still keep overthinking it
dating,esnwwpf,t3_c8jmlg,1562153221.0,this is true lol I had a guy (whom I used to have a crush on) where we promised to meet up for coffee outside and he ended up not showing up because “he was tired from cleaning the house” the previous night and told me he’ll reschedule the plan to meet me again. 2 weeks after I got nothing from him and right now I’m just tired of putting effort for someone who aren’t giving me the equal amount and that sucks
dating_advice,esnwhw4,t3_c8j4k0,1562152806.0,omg this post is literally me
Crushes,esl2eah,t3_c86dcg,1562077933.0,Ikr lol me and my crush talked a lot in the beginning when summer started but then he got busy with studying for his exams and his other friends and we just drifted apart like that and now we just stopped talking lol kinda sad but then I get over it
Crushes,esdjpm2,t3_c73wek,1561859493.0,"This was me last week, I had a dream me and my crush were dating and I remember it made my heart flutter but the moment I woke up it just made me sad knowing it was just a dream because I know that feeling is something I would never feel irl lol"
lonely,epsk20j,t3_bvofpq,1559451938.0,Happy birthday! 😊
dating,epsk0jj,t3_bvsua9,1559451892.0,Thanks for thi.! I have never been in a relationship and it gets lonely when the friends you hang out with daily are in relationships/having crushes when you arent. I’m trying to pick up new hobbies like playing instruments to keep myself busy this summer but it does get lonely a bit
depression,epgu7hj,t3_buq56r,1559218480.0,Most times I just don’t feel anything internally like it’s empty. Even when I’m talking to my friends and being happy but I still feel nothing and empty inside which sucks
Crushes,eoxf0wy,t3_bt79fx,1558923052.0,This is so cute! So happy for you 🤗☺️
