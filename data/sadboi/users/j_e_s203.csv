StamfordCT,fn8dmm9,t3_g07wfc,1586739293.0,"Born and raised in Stamford, living here on and off for over 30 years.  Like any city it has it's crime, but not an overwhelming amount.  It's like any other place.  Be smart and aware of your surrounding, location, etc.  I feel safe here and I feel safe having my nieces raised here. The morning commute can be super jammed some days and just others it just it's normal busy (north bound AND south bound) Considering the whole world is turned upside down right now, I have no clue what it will be like when things get back to ""normal"".  No doubt it's more expensive to live here but I honestly love it."

iamatotalpieceofshit,f6uyjkh,t3_dt05gf,1573171898.0,"It's amazing how absolutely shitty people can be and it breaks my heart.  I'm terribly sorry for your loss and for the extra heartbreak of some asshole stealing something so precious to you.  After my wonderful and loving grandfather passes away, someone stole the diamond earrings he gave to me.  This person knew how irreplaceable they were to me.  So much so that I rearly wore them in fear of loosing them.  What that asshole could never take from me was the love, appreciation, and respect we had for eachother.  I wish you all the best."
