BlackPeopleTwitter,fp4fx6j,t1_fp4esog,1588298188.0,"I‚Äôm not sure about this one. Disabled people are so underrepresented in movies that there‚Äôs no reason not to give slightly preferential treatment to a disabled actor if there are two actors of the same caliber. But the point is people are literally making money off of the disabled by telling stories about the disabled and cutting actual disabled people out of the equation. I feel like this is the same problem with hiring non-minority actors to play minority roles.

See: using Susan Sarandon to voice Dr. Wong in Rick and Morty. Not as big of a deal because it‚Äôs a cartoon but that‚Äôs kind of why people took issue. If Susan Sarandon wanted a role, she‚Äôs fucking Susan Sarandon and could have played anyone. It doesn‚Äôt mean minorities HAVE to play minorities, but it should be a consideration. Discrimination is systemic: there needs to be incentive to hire minority actors and write minority roles. It‚Äôs not really the same.

Edit for clarity: I would imagine it would be insulting to give an actor a role they didn‚Äôt earn just because they happened to be disabled or a minority. But the case is that minority actors are already underrepresented in the population of actors and minority roles are even more underrepresented in scripts. So it while it wouldn‚Äôt always be practical to narrow your casting pool, filmmakers owe it to the people they‚Äôre making money on to consider them and create space for them in the industry, otherwise it‚Äôs just exploitation."

Thetruthishere,fnt5ivo,t1_fnt38i9,1587235013.0,"Thanks for the encouragement! I‚Äôm 27 and I know I already have significant blocks, especially creatively. I‚Äôve always been kinda down on myself for not having confidence in my abilities, but it always seems kind of silly in the long run.

It sounds a little weird but I‚Äôve specifically doubted my abilities because nothing paranormal has ever really happened to me besides the dreams and synchronicities. I attract a lot of people into my life who have had a LOT of weird experiences, but I‚Äôve never had an experience! All I can think of is that past all those blocks I might have a strong guide spirit really protecting me from all the scary stuff! But I haven‚Äôt ever been able to communicate with another non-living or non-human entity in any capacity (to my knowledge)"
Thetruthishere,fnsx0i1,t3_g2i4rb,1587230403.0,"This kind of happens to me too! It‚Äôs very rarely visual although sometimes I will see things in real life and remember dreams I‚Äôve had and put 2 and 2 together, but I‚Äôm pretty bad at interpreting them, nor do I think I could. I‚Äôm not sure dreams would be reliable indicators of the future for ME. 

The way I think of the past and future really isn‚Äôt linear anyway, so I don‚Äôt see my abilities as precognitive in a strict sense. I would say that I‚Äôm claircognizant and clairsentient‚ÄîI just know things, somehow. Thoughts will pop into my head: sometimes they are specific, sometimes they aren‚Äôt. A lot of the times I find myself asking people if they told me something that I come to find out they definitely DIDNT tell me but is nonetheless true.

A lot of these things I don‚Äôt have control over and can‚Äôt really utilize for a specific purpose. They‚Äôre more like weird intrusive thoughts (‚Äúwhere did that come from?‚Äù) and gut feelings. The closest I can come is sort of concentrate and radiate energy out like ‚Äúfeelers.‚Äù Sometimes I will feel in something is ‚Äútrue‚Äù and will come to pass, or (if a person I receptive to me!) their energy. I‚Äôm not sure if you can connect with someone like that if they aren‚Äôt receptive. If they aren‚Äôt, much like if I don‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù something will happen, it‚Äôs like a big concrete wall. Nothing.

It seems at least in my personal matters, time and time again that if I can envision something in my mind‚Äôs eye, like in a practical way, and emotionally connect with it, it WILL happen. Jobs, internships, relationships. I can look into my Source and see that I‚Äôm already at x point in the future. I know how it‚Äôs going to feel to stand in a specific spot in time. Even bad stuff I would prefer not to think about. It‚Äôs not even worth keeping track of IMO because I only get to see proof of having ‚Äúbeen correct‚Äù after it would be weird for me to have an opinion, if it‚Äôs a moot point, or if it‚Äôs something bad wherein gloating would just make me a dick.

I would really like to strengthen these abilities & gain more confidence in them. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to separate my legitimate ability from my sense of ego and that can get me into trouble‚Äîbecause sometimes I feel like I know people better than what they‚Äôre trying to sell me. People also don‚Äôt really like to confront difficult topics and often lie to themselves so sometimes it‚Äôs hard to really know if you‚Äôre on the right track. There have been a lot of times where someone has tried to convince me that x wouldn‚Äôt happen, or didn‚Äôt happen, and then it turns out it did happen or will happen. Like ‚ÄúI could never cheat on my spouse,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never move away!‚Äù Or ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt break up‚Äù or ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt leave this job‚Äù and then guess what... 

And I mean really tough stuff that isn‚Äôt your business to tell. Like I could tell my ex‚Äôs daughter had been sexually abused and he didn‚Äôt believe me until a couple years later when she told him. It wasn‚Äôt my business to bring up. I‚Äôm still young and learning. It‚Äôs lonely business though, that‚Äôs for sure"
Thetruthishere,fnsvsph,t1_fnrk601,1587229747.0,"I mean they still don‚Äôt really know what it is or how to treat it, they just have educated guesses. Even if they knew, there is some extra explaining they‚Äôd have to do about the common shared hallucinations that people have during these episodes‚Äîshadow people, etc, and that would be more like theoretical psychology than hard science"
Thetruthishere,fnsvof4,t3_g2qfcr,1587229683.0,"Sometimes I‚Äôve had some really messed up dreams from the perspective of someone else like this. They‚Äôre dreams I‚Äôll remember for years, if not decades! I don‚Äôt understand how people like my bf says he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt remember his dreams.‚Äù I could legit write psychological horror novels sometimes! 

Not always bad though"
Thetruthishere,fnsv1qy,t3_g3nlan,1587229337.0,I suppose it‚Äôs a moot point now but I can‚Äôt believe you just assumed everything was peachy and canceled those investigators after you had all that evidence and something even FOLLOWING YOU ON VACATION!!

Paranormal,fns15ck,t1_fn5lqiv,1587209237.0,"I‚Äôm not surprised that a basement like that existed, as a traditional root cellar. There are places like that in Pennsylvania, too. Mostly used for storing wood or wines, cured meats and root veggies. And coal! Things like that. I remember a couple years ago my coworker (an older lady, 60-70) was showing me her house bc I was gonna house sit for her and in her basement was an area like you‚Äôre describing. They had made an actual basement around it and left this one part of coal or wood or whatever. It looked like SPIDER PARADISE and I did not really feel like opening that door. Can‚Äôt remember if I did. Just really creepy.

How did you first encounter the basement thing? Story sounds more and more like American Horror Story, from the SWAT team to the ill medium"
