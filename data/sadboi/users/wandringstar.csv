Make sure they’re as dry as possible before going into the oil or it can bubble over. 

Source: worked in a kitchen, just made bomb fries the other day. Pretty sure Gordon Ramsay talks about this method a lot.

[Here ](https://i.imgur.com/t7lAY70.jpg) are the  hand-cut potatoes before I boiled them; [here](https://i.imgur.com/B4YwfCm.jpg) they are after the second fry.

My second batch looked better but it was gone way before I got the chance to snap a pic. 

Bonus: Here is a [low-carb version](https://i.imgur.com/vcmfSSJ.jpg) I experimented with the other day. They’re daikon radishes and will need to be cut thicker and baked/salted/dehydrated instead of boiled or low-temp frying before the final deep fry.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fp4fx6j,t1_fp4esog,1588298188.0,"I’m not sure about this one. Disabled people are so underrepresented in movies that there’s no reason not to give slightly preferential treatment to a disabled actor if there are two actors of the same caliber. But the point is people are literally making money off of the disabled by telling stories about the disabled and cutting actual disabled people out of the equation. I feel like this is the same problem with hiring non-minority actors to play minority roles.

See: using Susan Sarandon to voice Dr. Wong in Rick and Morty. Not as big of a deal because it’s a cartoon but that’s kind of why people took issue. If Susan Sarandon wanted a role, she’s fucking Susan Sarandon and could have played anyone. It doesn’t mean minorities HAVE to play minorities, but it should be a consideration. Discrimination is systemic: there needs to be incentive to hire minority actors and write minority roles. It’s not really the same.

Edit for clarity: I would imagine it would be insulting to give an actor a role they didn’t earn just because they happened to be disabled or a minority. But the case is that minority actors are already underrepresented in the population of actors and minority roles are even more underrepresented in scripts. So it while it wouldn’t always be practical to narrow your casting pool, filmmakers owe it to the people they’re making money on to consider them and create space for them in the industry, otherwise it’s just exploitation."

The way I think of the past and future really isn’t linear anyway, so I don’t see my abilities as precognitive in a strict sense. I would say that I’m claircognizant and clairsentient—I just know things, somehow. Thoughts will pop into my head: sometimes they are specific, sometimes they aren’t. A lot of the times I find myself asking people if they told me something that I come to find out they definitely DIDNT tell me but is nonetheless true.

A lot of these things I don’t have control over and can’t really utilize for a specific purpose. They’re more like weird intrusive thoughts (“where did that come from?”) and gut feelings. The closest I can come is sort of concentrate and radiate energy out like “feelers.” Sometimes I will feel in something is “true” and will come to pass, or (if a person I receptive to me!) their energy. I’m not sure if you can connect with someone like that if they aren’t receptive. If they aren’t, much like if I don’t “feel” something will happen, it’s like a big concrete wall. Nothing.

It seems at least in my personal matters, time and time again that if I can envision something in my mind’s eye, like in a practical way, and emotionally connect with it, it WILL happen. Jobs, internships, relationships. I can look into my Source and see that I’m already at x point in the future. I know how it’s going to feel to stand in a specific spot in time. Even bad stuff I would prefer not to think about. It’s not even worth keeping track of IMO because I only get to see proof of having “been correct” after it would be weird for me to have an opinion, if it’s a moot point, or if it’s something bad wherein gloating would just make me a dick.

I would really like to strengthen these abilities & gain more confidence in them. Sometimes it’s hard to separate my legitimate ability from my sense of ego and that can get me into trouble—because sometimes I feel like I know people better than what they’re trying to sell me. People also don’t really like to confront difficult topics and often lie to themselves so sometimes it’s hard to really know if you’re on the right track. There have been a lot of times where someone has tried to convince me that x wouldn’t happen, or didn’t happen, and then it turns out it did happen or will happen. Like “I could never cheat on my spouse,” or “I’ll never move away!” Or “we won’t break up” or “I won’t leave this job” and then guess what... 

And I mean really tough stuff that isn’t your business to tell. Like I could tell my ex’s daughter had been sexually abused and he didn’t believe me until a couple years later when she told him. It wasn’t my business to bring up. I’m still young and learning. It’s lonely business though, that’s for sure"

Even if they knew, there is some extra explaining they’d have to do about the common shared hallucinations that people have during these episodes—shadow people, etc, and that would be more like theoretical psychology than hard science"

I don’t understand how people like my bf says he “doesn’t remember his dreams.” I could legit write psychological horror novels sometimes! 

Not always bad though"

Paranormal,fns15ck,t1_fn5lqiv,1587209237.0,"I’m not surprised that a basement like that existed, as a traditional root cellar. There are places like that in Pennsylvania, too. Mostly used for storing wood or wines, cured meats and root veggies. And coal! Things like that. I remember a couple years ago my coworker (an older lady, 60-70) was showing me her house bc I was gonna house sit for her and in her basement was an area like you’re describing. They had made an actual basement around it and left this one part of coal or wood or whatever. It looked like SPIDER PARADISE and I did not really feel like opening that door. Can’t remember if I did. Just really creepy.

How did you first encounter the basement thing? Story sounds more and more like American Horror Story, from the SWAT team to the ill medium"

That’s one of the things people always say after they get hauntings: “I had a bad feeling but I ignored it,” or “I didn’t ask why it was so cheap,” etc. Even from a practical standpoint there might be something off about the property: natural gas deposits, weird electrical stuff, carbon monoxide. Who knows what you’re picking up on? Better safe than sorry, that’s what I always say. Why even give yourself the stress?"
