It is often a book recommended to those recently grieving. It's about six different characters all grieving over their dear friend, Percival. The novel is written in a beautiful stream of consciousness way as it analyzes the human condition in six different perspectives of the world."
love,fmr7ved,t3_fwgfkq,1586315958.0,"I would confront her with the issue and say that you already know the truth and there is no point in lying any longer. Talking to her ex on the phone is questionable (but understandable in some instances. Being friends with an ex isn't wrong always, and sometimes indicates a healthy and mature individual) but since she is lying about it, changes things entirely.

If she's not willing to talk to you about it and not work with you about it, then you deserve better. No one deserves that kind of disrespect and you should stand by that. 

I hope it works out for you."
love,fmr7i0r,t3_fwkmfp,1586315704.0,"A relationship with someone isn't them *just* being a shoulder to cry on or to vent to. This is a definite plus, but a true relationship is one where they can do the same and you love them just the same, flaws and all. And the greatest thing - it doesn't feel like work. Sometimes you will have to put work into it, but mostly the relationship is enjoyable. If this is not what you're experiencing, then you are not with the right person. And that's okay! You're 19 and still young and you aren't supposed to be with *the one* quite yet. This is the time in your life when you should focus on yourself, improving yourself and your well-being. Being happier with yourself. And all of these things are very possible. I quite literally would not be here today, saying this, if it wasn't. 

I used to be in your exact spot. Thinking love isn't worth the effort, or the pain. 

But today, I am happier. I am no longer suicidal. And I'm falling in love - the kind that does not make me sick to my stomach with dread and worry. 

You will get there, and when you do, you'll want it. And it won't be anxiety-inducing or sickening or dreadful. It will be nice. Until then, keep living. Enjoy your life and yourself."

If it were to ever become a likely scenario, do you think that we would do adequate testing before landing on a planet and exposing ourselves or animals? I'm sure there's an epidemiologist around somewhere, but it'd truly take years of research to confirm if they would in fact be harmless. I wonder if future-us would take the time it needs. I never hear people talk about it now."
AskScienceDiscussion,fisu3n2,t1_fisi3kj,1582693395.0,"^ yes. 

But also, have you seen the end of the movie War of the Worlds? 
The chances of that happening are well, high. If we are taking animals or living thing from our environment to a completely new one that can sustain life, chances are that planet also has life too. Most likely microbial. But our immune systems does not have the protections it needs to fight a microbiome so greatly different than what we are familiar with. So its likely we will all die or become so sick that it is inhabitable to us. 

But if we are really thinking about the inifibite possibilities that is space, it could possibly be an organism so vastly different in chemical and evolutionary makeup that it affects us none at all. 

This was a bit of a tangent, I apologize.... But intriguing to consider nonetheless."
AskScienceDiscussion,fiss5df,t3_f9mhli,1582691850.0,"CF4 (carbontetraflourine) has an extremely high bond strength and thus would take a significant amount of energy to break the C-F bonds. Not to mention CF4 is also considered to be a potential greenhouse gas, so if you were to try to do this reaction in an open system (impossible on a mass scale), it'd potentially make the problem worse. 

I like where your mind is at, though. We need creative thinkers like you coming up with possible solutions to tackle this problem. 

Just remember that if it were to be profitable, it'd have to be a thermodynamically favorable reaction in order for it to have mass effect on the atmosphere. We can't collect the atmosphere, put it into a lab, and then put back out the things we want, unfortunately."
AskScienceDiscussion,fisraa1,t3_f9k1q9,1582691197.0,"A tennis ball doesn't bounce unless you bounce it. But that ball wouldn't bounce if that ball didn't exist in the first place. So how was that ball made? Someone, or something, took the different materials (made rubber from oil, the fibers from cotton or plastic, the color from dye, etc). But someone had to expend energy to make that ball. And then someone had to expend energy to make it bounce. If someone didn't put in any energy and continued to sit on the couch and eat Indian food, then that oil would have stayed oil and not turned into rubber, those fibers would have stayed on the cotton plant. 
Aka that hydrogen would still be sitting there, hanging out.
You have to put in energy in order for something to work or be different than their inherent nature. 
So we eat to get energy, and use that energy to make new and more organized things. 

In scientific terms....
The universe and everything inside of it tends towards chaos. There is no order to anything, atoms will be in a state that is thermodynamically favorable to them, a state that requires no Work for them to be that way. This typically means more atoms in a disarray.
But often, living things and man-made things defeats this law of entropy through the work of energy. If we put energy into something, we can make it more ordered. Many molecules made into one large complex molecule. But at the cost of energy. Energy is typically quantized by light, or the original source of it at least, hence why we call it the giver of life."

suggestmeabook,fem4grt,t3_epm2mz,1579239444.0,"Virginia Woolf is considered a classic, but not a well-read one. I'm always sorely disappointed when I hear people have never read or only read ""A Room of Ones Own"" by her. 

My recommendation - ""The Waves""

My favorite book of my entire life and it will be until the day I die. It centers around six characters and how each of them are dealing with the death of their dear friend, Percival. It uses this as a plot device, but the real magic is in each characters soliloquies. Each character is so beautifully and uniquely written. Woolf so talently describes those in-between moments in life, the ones where youre caught between actions and just stuck in your head. What are you thinking and feeling? Can you put it into words? She does. And it's magical. 

Anyone who has read this or will, please talk to me! I've been waiting to meet someone who has also read the book."

I was seeking insight on the kind of things the Peace Corp offers and what I could possibly do. Not a lecture about needing to do research, which is obviously something that is to be done AFTER the first question is answered.

To me, that's moreso a job than a volunteer experience, even it's volunteer kind of work. Maybe it was a different section I was looking at, but they all seemed to be about 1 year terms or shorter, which I figured would be for an entry level position. 
And forgive me, I shouldn't have used to word travelling. That implies I was up for a vacation, and that's not what i meant. I moreso meant I would like to go to places where I felt like I could be of more help. 
I use the word third world because in both my history classes, schooling, and charity work that is the word I have heard used. Never have I heard another word nor was i aware of the fact that it was deemed derogatory. My ignorance can be attributed to the environment and country I have grown up in, hopefully an ignorance I can eliminate through experiences elsewhere.

The important message that I was trying to get across in this post was if the peace corps was really looking for people with my resume, and what kind of work I could possibly do with it. Teaching in a place that needs it, was a preference."

Tinnitus in your ears is pretty common with all people, and especially those who have headaches or migraines. The disoriented, as in dizzy? Can't answer that one for you bc I also can't figure it out for myself /: but the overall shitty feeling and other symptoms... Probs a migraine. I know that's an unsatisfying answer, trust me, I've been there. Been trying to figure out the cause behind all of my symptoms and have finally just concluded migraines suck and no one knows why. If the sharp pain only lasts a few seconds it might be a cluster migraine. Not sure about what medicines they have for those but if it a a pain that lasts, def look into taking a prescription.

The first chemical equations were made and the scientific method was employed for the first time ever. This led to more precise and accurate experiments that were better proven and understood.
