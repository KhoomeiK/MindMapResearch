do NOT make the mistake of letting a MAN or ANYONE take advantage of you. you are not a sexual object. the only person you will have sexual relations with is the person you fall in love with who loves you too. that is what we call making love. not ‚Äúfucking‚Äù. people of my generation have ruined the picture of making love and turned it into something disgusting. 
honey, when you fall in love and you know he‚Äôs the one, it will be the greatest feeling in your heart. this is not love. do not let a man take advantage of you. 

be safe please, Autumn"

you must think of yourself before anyone else. if she freaks out, threatens suicide, comfort her but know your limits. because i don‚Äôt know her personally but some girls will use that to reel you back in. i‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs a sweet girl and she just wants to be loved."

something that hit me personally was the late night adventures you mentioned. sometimes i get random spurts of a happy rebellious feeling and i just want to live my life while i‚Äôm young and go on a night road trip with friends and my s/o. that is definitely possible! but i need you to know that people do love you and care. they‚Äôre here for you."

Him and I were good friends, I trusted him and I was also good friends with his sister. 
Anyways, yeah, John and I were good friends until he disappeared off social media and I noticed I had not seen him in the halls. My friend pulled me aside and told me that John had been arrested and was in prison for raping a 5 year old girl. I was fucking disgusted. It was hard for me to come into school the next few days knowing that I had been friends with a guy who wanted to fuck a kid. Everyone at school acted weird and I never trusted anyone the same."
