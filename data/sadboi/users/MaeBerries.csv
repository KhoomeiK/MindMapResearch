zoloft,fel3y52,t3_emkfnx,1579213540.0,I'm 124 days in and mine went away about a week ago :p
zoloft,fdtk7bx,t3_emkfnx,1578717946.0,I get this  ! Couldnt find anyone else that did until now !
zoloft,fdtiisk,t1_fdswqxa,1578717250.0,I second this üòÇ
zoloft,fdizk4l,t3_ellmkp,1578454684.0,"Lots of the time when I'm stressed I dream vividly of my trauma and I just find it interesting how the medication we are taking to treat the after effects drags the stories again out of our repressed subconscious... sometimes it feels so purposeful like the medication is helping me face, process, and understand it to some degree. Or at least the impact its had on me."
magicthecirclejerking,f7vyc2a,t3_dxtd6q,1574028180.0,LOL nice !!!!
zoloft,f626624,t3_dq0vah,1572653966.0,Yep I learned this the hard way last weekend! Went from moderately tipsy to falling down off balance but somehow still feeling mentally clear and having a super clear memory of the whole night. And then a headache the next morning like my head was going to explode. First time and last LOL
zoloft,f55e6wj,t1_f54lyjf,1572005784.0,My pharmacist told me to stop after a week at 25 but if I DO get side effects I can take 25 every second day and taper even more gradually
zoloft,f548q7j,t3_dmqv65,1571974264.0,The only difference is I'm about 40 days in so 2 weeks 25mg and 3 weeks or so 50 mg
zoloft,f548nxa,t3_dmqv65,1571974213.0,Totally following because your story is 100% identical to mine in every way-even the duration. Felt exactly the same way and beginning the taper down to 25 for a week tomorrow.  We r in this together hha!
FemaleHairLoss,f4qpjbo,t1_f4k2lhq,1571756523.0,Yes I did and that also wasnt present. I know it looks like purely crown loss but actually it is that density everywhere. Like if I were to part anywhere on my head it would look like this. Even back bottom etc
zoloft,f4qpbpp,t1_f4oxe9g,1571756439.0,It 100% has gotten rid of that for me so far !
alopecia_areata,f4a6wt3,t3_djzg2s,1571489795.0,You are SO pretty !!!
FemaleHairLoss,f4a6o4s,t1_f49t43e,1571489695.0,Yes I did have my horomones checked and was told everything is normal :/ was told it was diffuse but this was like 10 years ago and I feel like I want another consult !
FemaleHairLoss,f49301f,t3_djt84o,1571455714.0,Normal to me !
zoloft,f492ww6,t3_djxzq4,1571455660.0,It gets worse before it gets better ! For me after each dosage increase it took 2 weeks for the side effects to go from strong to mild. I've been on 25 mg 2 weeks and 50 mg 2 weeks so it gets easier
FemaleHairLoss,f3rgh66,t3_d69ooc,1571087871.0,Medication helps more than anything. Struggled so so hard for 10 years (I'm 27) told no one but family. Fast forward 30 days on zoloft and I opened up about it on my social media to all my friends and acquaintances and even posted pictures and feel nothing but proud. We didnt chose these bodies. It's not our fault this is happening. Worse things could happen. It fucking sucks but it's not worth losing ourselves over.
zoloft,f3do9k3,t3_dg5m3o,1570842289.0,Apparently I do too
zoloft,f359u41,t1_f337ty5,1570672025.0,"50 mg hated me ! I completely stopped taking it for a day, convinced I would never take it again. A day later I'm back on 25 mg and I think I'll alternate 25 mg and 50 mg every other day type thing."
zoloft,f359kee,t1_f33ce03,1570671831.0,Bro with you lol I'm trying to convince myself that it makes me sleepy. Brain games initiated
zoloft,f359e0v,t1_f33rs74,1570671702.0,25 days still sleeping like sh*t ü§£ had to scale back to 25 mg. Gonna try 25 every other day and 50 every day that is not that day lol. So alternating. I've seen some ppl do this
zoloft,f22octm,t1_f22e87n,1569893074.0,My sense of smell seemed to get sharper the first day or two which is crazy. Thought I was imagining it but it happened on the first day or 2 of 24 mg then again on the first day or two of 50 mg! So weird I could smell cleaners and laundry detergent on clothing and just random things you dont normally notice..
zoloft,f20etrn,t3_dbaqqd,1569858832.0,Totally happened to me too very normal I'm told
zoloft,f206hly,t1_f1q2cc6,1569855884.0,"Yes I am. Was prescribed 10mg quetiapine but it gave me quite noticable shortness of breath in the morning once so discontinued that dose. Used zopiclone 3.75 mg but it just reduced anxiety and didnt make me sleepy. Last night used 5 mg quetiapine (literally a quarter of a pill) and 3.75 zop (half a pill) and it worked like a charm no negative side effects. My insomnia only seems to last 3-4 days when I initially went on, and the dosage increase is feeling like it will be the same. 
See the doc on the 4th and will bring it up if it isnt resolve in search of a better option than cutting up a bunch of pills to avoid side effects of a whole dose of quetiapine"
zoloft,f1pse0p,t3_dahp1p,1569687333.0,"Yay!!!!!! I just upped from 25 to 50 and I'm nervous cause this is only day 14 of sertraline so not too much benefit yet just side effects but I had one random really good day that didnt just feel like me, it felt like the meds had helped! But then back to just side effects. Hopeful! So glad to see this post"

zoloft,f0ndn01,t1_f0myfj9,1568767295.0,I also just started on 25 mg 4 days ago! Tried it a couple weeks back- wicked side effects and quit. But then depression kicked my ass and I got on them again and WIERDLY no side effects this time?! Apart from sleeplessness which my doc prescribed quetiapine short term for. Following :) the more support on this journey the better !!
