AskReddit,fn30goy,t1_fn305hb,1586609502.0,"i have cptsd from approx. 20 years of abuse/trauma so i feel ya homie but you're right, this isn't the place. i wasn't talking about all mentally ill people, just myself. that said, i think most people understand there is injustice and misery. it's just that some people are predisposed to bounce back from that kind of knowledge, and others become depressed, hence ""chemical imbalance."" i've had friends who were beat by their parents but somehow did not develop any kind of severe mental illness issue, so i know it's not just the circumstances. (edit: and conversely, i know people who had great childhoods/lives and still ended up with mental illness, so it's not always trauma, and in fact people like this often feel guilty because they feel they ""shouldn't"" be unhappy)

i used to think that people who weren't depressed must just be ignorant of these kinds of pain but as i got older i realized that they just had better coping/survival skills than i did (whether by nature or by nurture) and that's not my fault! or their fault, for that matter.

bottom line is, psychology/psychiatry is nebulous and imprecise in many ways so it's hard to say, sorry!"

i'd love for people to understand what my life is like in a realistic way not feel sorry for me like awwwwww poor sick person awwww wow you're so braaaaave for having a brain chemical imbalance

add to that the fact that it's hard to get over knowing that the actor is an able-bodied person trying your life story on for a costume and it does get a little dicey sometimes, although i do believe it can be done respectfully! (OBVIOUSLY that's the whole point of acting, i'm not saying every actor has to have the exact same race/sexuality/ability/gender/life story blah blah. blah as the character they're portraying, it's just a matter of the sensitivity and nuance of the portrayal)
