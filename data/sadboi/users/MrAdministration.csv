I can see it being a mix of a few things. But I definitely think Akechi is still alive. They also 'wrote him out' of future games by having him say he doesn't care about the Phantom Thieves much anymore. That's assuming Royal is canon and not Scramble."
Persona5,fr4jf4x,t1_fr4ew9a,1589889912.0,"I had a different idea about it, but I liked the general direction of yours. If Maruki controls reality on the 24th, that means the fight against Akechi must have been at least a few days earlier (without the accurate dates in front of me and ignoring player input, assuming the Thieves send the calling card a day before the deadline).

Before everyone breaks out of Maruki's spell, Joker tells Akechi what happened after Shido's Palace. Akechi even says ""I'm insulted that you'd think I was dead"". He later says that people that were dead previously (Makoto's father, Okumura and Wakaba) weren't ""revived"", they were just never dead to begin with.

Throughout the story there are obviously two different versions of Akechi. Robbie Daymond even makes it a point to play him differently. There's the true Akechi (Loki) and the Detective Prince (Robin Hood). During one of the bad endings where you accept Maruki's reality, the versions that shows up is Detective Prince Akechi. I don't know if it's important, I just found it interesting.

At the end of the game, Maruki says he brought Akechi back to give he and Joker a chance to start over, but consider this. Wakaba disappeared when Futaba realized the truth. Morgana turned back into a cat. Makoto's dad was gone. If Joker wasn't under Maruki's spell, shouldn't have Akechi disappeared?"

Let's not mention the fact that Kayn doesn't even look towards mid lane, where Ryze is pushing in with no mana, while he does scuttle. That's a flash burned and if the wave is shoved maybe even a TP, which means Ryze can't follow cause he doesn't have ult. Then Orianna and Kayn can go top side and make it a 3v2, and if Ryze follows up with TP he ends up losing XP and gold from the wave being shoved in to his turret.

Kayn going bot side is a nice idea (get a countergank on the other side of the map) but he goes back there again and ends up giving a kill to Ezreal, which means he just threw the kill gold that Lucian got back at the enemy botlane.

Point is, Kayn had better options, and he used none of them."

He does get a gank off at bottom lane, which gets a kill, but then he goes there again and just gives the kill back.

He either should've counterjungled everything on blue side placing vision as he goes since Jarvan's top side, or gone to the top lane to at least help his laner get to the turret. He could've also done a straight babysit top since Jarvan was there the whole time, you have no fear that he'll be elsewhere, and with a ward in top tribrush he could've seen if Jarvan was trying to counterjungle, where he could've responded and maybe pulled Gnar down or the midlaner up."

nba,fpo1ndy,t1_fpnvy75,1588776754.0,"I didn't know about the change in ownership, thanks for clarifying.

Durant didn't have the defensive knowledge and experience he has now to guard centers. K-Mart was great for them actually, he had his best 3 point shooting season, if I remember correctly. Their bench was the problem though, it was bad. Reggie Jackson was still unpolished and Derek Fisher didn't give much value on the court either besides complaining when he didn't get a charge call.

The thing that baffles me about Perkins though is that a few short years earlier, on the Celtics, he was pretty good. Not incredible by any means, but he was a serviceable starting center next to KG. I could never understand what happened in OKC that made him fall off a cliff."
nba,fpnmeij,t1_fpndwvi,1588767365.0,"I understand your hindsight point, but consider this:

Ibaka had to stay because of the exact point you mentioned - missing him would hurt them a lot, even if they kept Harden. 

Perkins, however, was not good enough on defense to account for the negative he was on offense. Now I'm not talking about a lack of an offensive game, which he never had. He had terrible hands and couldn't pass accurately or handle the ball well enough. He had a weird green light from Scott Brooks to get post isolations. These are all things that really hurt OKC, because they wasted possessions for no reason at all.

Ibaka didn't have the size to contend with young Dwight, but he provided necessary spacing and was a way better defender than Perk.

We already established Ibaka has to stay. But back before the trade, Harden anchored OKC's bench - heck, he WAS their bench. He was deservedly sixth man of the year, and players like that are very valuable. In addition to that, he lead the league in free throws in the 4th quarter despite coming off the bench. No one anticipated him to be as good as he is now, but flashes were certainly there.

If you asked anyone, including Sam Presti, they take Harden 120 times out of 100.

I think it ultimately came down to financials. Now this is purely hypothetical - but OKC also shelled out the highest payroll in the league the one year they had Melo, PG and Russ. Again, this is all speculating, but I think ownership just felt the need to commit and try and go for it, especially after they were cheap with Harden."
nba,fpnatcp,t1_fpmtjn2,1588756300.0,"You wanna know what makes it worse?

The narrative back then was they needed to 'choose' between Ibaka and Harden, who were both expiring. That shouldn't have been the case if they just amnestied / dumped Perkins. They choose to keep Kendrick Perkins, who was terrible for them in the playoffs, on their payroll, and underpay and eventually trade James Harden.

Fucking laughable management."

Berserk,fomn4kr,t1_fomj49f,1587896396.0,"If I remember correctly, and I dont think I do because I havent read the Eclipse in a long time, I think the little floating fat Godhand dude asks Void if he foresaw this coming too, like he foresaw Griffith becoming Femto. And again, if my memory serves me right, I believe he says he didn't but he just kinda rolls with it."
Berserk,fommylg,t1_fomhvuo,1587896204.0,Agreed! Although I hope they don't reveal too much at once. I know it might seem like getting everything at once would be awesome but being too hasty with it could potentially hurt the story.
cats,fomluyy,t1_fomhj3y,1587894962.0,"I managed to get a vet appointment and took her. It ended up being fleas, she got medication for it and she should be okay tomorrow.

We did actually try the new hiding spot. Her litter box has a cover on it so we got her a bed that's covered up like aj igloo. She slept in it for a bit and then decided she had a better time in her box. Even removing the cover didn't help, but I hope it will once she gets better."
Berserk,fomlmnn,t1_fomixaa,1587894698.0,"I'm on a mobile and can't like it properly and it's clickbaity as hell, so I'll summarize for ya. The hint is when Skull Knight says that Guts ""bears witness to the end of his journey""."

Berserk,fomih07,t1_fomhcdn,1587891244.0,"I'd hate that, to be honest. 

Imagine this - we know very little about the Godhand. However, we do know they cab grant power for a sacrifice. We also know, according to Skull Knight, that they exist ""outside the story"", which could hint further at their power. We also know Void goes on about causality and how it ""flows"", that pretty much everything in the world of Berserk is destined to happen for a reason. (I need to reread the manga, I might have missed a few details, but I assume you get what I was talking about).

Guts being a destiny child would ruin not only his character but the entire story. If Void knows about causality he'd know Guts is destined to oppose it - wouldn't he just kill him on the spot? The only time they ""met"" was during the Eclipse, where Guts had NO CHANCE of surviving of Void just decided to kill him. And we don't even know Void's full power yet, or any of the Godhand."
Berserk,fomhob9,t1_fomh874,1587890401.0,"An identity reveal would be nice, I think we need a ""big picture"" talk is a lot more crucial. Think about it - this story has been going on for so long but all we know about the Godhand is this: there are few, as well as few chosen to be part of them, you need a huge sacrifice, Griffith's in it...and that's it. I think. I might have missed something, but you get the idea. The big baddies of the story, as well as their main opposition (Skull Dude), are still a huge unknown to us. I get a feeling we're reaching the final stretch, the time to reveal more and more is coming."

jaycemains,fok39n5,t3_g7tf1b,1587834589.0,"Honestly, the Ghostblade spike is way better for Jayce. When you think of Sanguine Blade, you think of split pushing and taking out turrets OR dueling 1v1 when you pull pressure around the map. Jayce is already very good at taking turrets due to W, so he doesn't need Sanguine. He'd also rather not duel. I mean, you can push and duel if you're head, but there's a lot more value in grouping and nuking the other team with Shock Blasts.

Champions like Tryndamere and Trundle suit Sanguine Blade much better."
jaycemains,fok2jhv,t1_fojx9a4,1587834195.0,Umm...no?
jaycemains,fojayl2,t1_fogpuy3,1587815192.0,"It depends, honestly. You just have to remember that trades in the bottom lane against an opposing ADC and Support are different than trades in the top lane. I haven't played Jayce ADC in a long time so I don't really know how the new botlaners interact with him in a lane. Just at a glance though, I'd go Phase Rush for the first Lethality build. You can take Electrocute for some extra burst, but I think Phase Rush is super valuable because:  1. Sorcery tree is very good on Jayce, and 2. Phase Rush gives you the ability to not only stick on to ADCs, but also the mobility to get out once you got your burst off. Plus, it's the best teamfight keystone for Jayce, hands down.

For the tear build, I'd go with Conqueror and Inspiration secondary, aiming for 45% CDR as fast as I can get it. Conqueror will let you take longer trades in a 1v1 or 2v2, it'll scale up your damage throughout the fight as well, and with 45% CDR and mana from tear you're gonna be spamming your skills constantly."
