mentalhealth,f4oyq98,t3_dkxsh8,1571711469.0,"That sucks, but I'm what your talking about because I'm the same way every feeling I show people is fake besides anger and hatred, I don't have feeling anymore besides anger, and depression, I'm just always numb and I always try to cheer people up but no one really cares how I'm doing, but if you wanna talk about anything just talk about it, there is a lot of people on here including me that love to do what you do and just want to help so talk about anything you need to and these people will give you amazing advice"
mental,f4oybjx,t1_f4oy5hs,1571711195.0,"I have talked to a therapist and am still talking to them to this day, but it doesn't really solve any of my problems to tell a therapist because they are just there to listen and my mom kept trying to lie to the therapist about how she is and I shut her down real quick, so he knows but what is he going to do, nothing"
mental,f4oy5hs,t1_f4438ax,1571711081.0,"Thank you, and I have tried getting support from my mom and my dad but neither of them really care, I'm just a druggie in their eyes, but the thing is that my parents weren't in my life's often, ever since I was a little kid my dad has always been at work travelling and my mom was always in her room smoking and getting on facebook, which she still does today and all she does is make fun of people and post shitty stuff about people but she the lil bitch, the people that know her she has like this persona cause when she talking to cops or her friends or anyone she just met she is a totally different person, but anyways us they weren't ever really apart of my life until they caught me smoking, but my lil brother has always been babied by my mom like an I just suppose to feel like the f*** up of the family or what, but my parents kinda just drifted back out of my life not that long ago they both always smoking and my dads always on the phone with his f2f nd my mom still being the lil botch she is on facebook, she was harassing my friends and a bunch of carp and she denies she ever did anything, and it like if I don't do what they want me to im nothing to them but I ain't the person they want me to be I have dreams for something they would probably call a shut dream, and when I finally met my friends I really like got attached like it finally felt like someone cared about me and what I do then they got torn out of my life and I haven't been the same since"
mental,f43tvnw,t1_f3xsbe3,1571345048.0,"I am 15, and about a year ago i got caught smoking weed so then she did all that and now i have nothing to do and have nobody or nothing to live for. I am pretty much just locked inside and that's it, after my mom did this i fell down a really deep depression and started taking pills and at first I was scared to do too many pills cause I didn't want to die because i thought there was a chance that I was going back to public schools but i didn't so i fell deeper and deeper into depression and started taking oxys and xans like they were candy, i got addicted to oxys not xans but i did get myself off of them, but the only reason i did the oxys and xans was because i feel like i have no one and i honestly wanted to die and i actually felt happy when i took them i could actually smile and it felt amazing to be able to do that again. I don't think i was acting out in a destructive way in my opinion because I didn't and still don't yell back at my mom or argue with her and I do what she asks me to do, but there is no motivation in my life anymore to do anything anymore and idk what to do with myself, and to answer your last question no my friends didn't encourage me to do anything bad, they told me not to smoke if I didn't want to and that they get it if i didn't want to, but I said i wanted to so I did and they never made me do anything they always supported me and I really felt like I had someone in my life, because my mom or dad hasn't really been in my life until they both found out i was smoking, my friends were the only thing that felt like family besides my grandparents, and just to add I found sum adderall in my moms dresser and sum xans that arent hers that she been buying, I just don't know what to do with anything so I just thought i would share it"

mentalhealth,f3wgjht,t3_dihw9j,1571201674.0,"Therapist will not make you feel bad, you can't be scared to open up, just tell them what is going on and if you ask they won't tell anyone what you two have talked about, therapist are just there to listen and give advice and it should help you in the long run, they are going to tell you things that are going to help but again you can't be afraid to open up to them because they will not judge you, therapist are therapist because they know how it feels to be where you are, therapist are the most empathetic people on earth and they know how it feels to be in your shoes, I am currently in therapy because of how my mental state is literally the worst and how I feel alone, even though I know I'm not alone I can't convince myself otherwise but I hope this helps, don't be scared of therapy"
