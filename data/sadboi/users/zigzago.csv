I definitely think my delusions were/are a product of subconcious fears and beliefs. It’s how I’ve learned to process and come to terms with my episodes."

BipolarReddit,fecowew,t1_fealsej,1578979478.0,"Honestly, it took 4-6 months for me to really get past everything and feel like myself again. But once the severe depression went away, it was like a veil was lifted. Such a relief. Just be easy on yourself for now, take it slow, and know this won’t last forever. There is light at the end of the tunnel!"
BipolarReddit,fe62nxw,t3_enueen,1578880419.0,"That’s exactly how I felt following my recent manic episode. Several months later, I can tell you that it does get better. You’ll slowly start to feel more “normal” again. Make sure you’re getting regular therapy to talk through and process everything. At least for me, my depression was definitely warping/clouding my view of the future and I have a very different headspace now. Hang in there!"

Might’ve just been a scam to collect tips but damn, that was one hell of a car ride."

BipolarReddit,f8eijvc,t3_e0hcxt,1574528329.0,"If there’s psychosis, and it’s his first episode, I suggest the hospital. Seriously wish I’d been taken to the hospital sooner than I was, because things progressed quickly and got very very dangerous. At the hospital he’ll be safe and taken care of, and can get an accurate diagnosis and meds."
