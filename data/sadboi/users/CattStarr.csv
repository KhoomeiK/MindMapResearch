I had no idea what I was looking at cuz I was like 15 at the time. But when his but started to hump, I figured it out and stopped him. He never did that again with me, butt he did move on to blankets and my other, neutered and spayed cats I had at the time. He yelled at them the whole time because well, none of them, himself included could mate. So it wasn't working and he knew that. We often had to take him off of my other cats because it looked like they were afraid. Eventually, he settled on blankets. He was the most intense case of humping I've ever seen."

AskReddit,eushkyu,t3_chf5ow,1564008503.0,"Asking for nudes, rushing the relationship, looking elsewhere for a relationship (if we're not trying to date someone else, we're working on our emotions for you. Be patient) while trying to woo us. It shows that you're not into our individual self, but the idea of a relationship, and that's sad and disgusting. Women want to be noticed for who they are as well as their beauty. 

Having no personality or interests/interesting things to talk about is a major turn off. Whining that you're a nice guy but can't get a date is also a no go. It shows you lack any interesting qualities.

Lacking confidence and charisma is another huge turn off. You have to be sure about yourself and have charm and wit. Girls want to be with a guy they notice as well as the guy who notices them.

Don't rush into grand romantic gestures. Too soon will scare her off. Plus, you don't know what she'd appreciate despite what you may find charming or adorable. You might like a romantic picnic on the beach but she might think sand in her crack. You might think a puppy is a cute present but she might be allergic. Etc. Stick to small, simpler gestures if you must, but really, it's easier if you're just her friend for a while. No gifts or anything, just two people chatting and hanging out.

There's a lot to consider, and I'm only one girl. Each woman has her own spiel of what would make or break a man for her. Your best bet is to find someone you like for who she is, and do everything you can for her. Take it slow, feel her out, figure out if she's into you, etc. I can only answer for myself after all."

Still brush, floss and use regular mouth wash, but the peroxide adds a medicinal effect. When you have a tooth ache, it helps relieve the issue. It also has a bleaching agent, so if you smoke or drink a lot of coffee it'll whiten them a little. It's not a miracle, so it won't be a major improvement on the whitening, but it's noticeable.

&#x200B;

You can also use it for earwax removal, buuuut it does dry out the canal so try not to itch it when you're done because you'll scratch it. This is only really ideal for people like me who have an over production of earwax, and can't use regular otc earwax removal kits. 

&#x200B;

Peroxide is also good for cleaning your face and reducing zits. Dab a little on some paper towels and hold it up to the zit for a minute or two, and after a few days, you should have some good results. It also removes dirt and oils without needing to scrub your face. It won't dry your face as bad as it does your ears, so there's that bonus. 

&#x200B;

If you've got a rash on your skin, you can wash it with Head and Shoulders or similar because of the zinc, which is soothing on dry and itchy skin. It won't actually heal the rash, you'll still need whatever kind of cream otc for your rash (clotrimazole for fungus, for instance), but soothing the skin makes it easier to not scratch which helps it heal on it's own, of course."

EstrangedAdultChild,etau5o0,t3_capv5r,1562629245.0,"I met my husband in high school 16 years ago, and we had a lot of issues. I think part of it definitely was from watching my now estranged parents coexist and exist with me. Everything was always chaos and alcohol with them. So, my relationship suffered, and he had no idea why I brought so much baggage, but bless his heart for being so in love with me that he's tolerate anything. I have ptsd from a previous relationship as well, which back then I believed was 100% of my problems.

&#x200B;

He actually helped me reach the decision to go estranged about 4 years ago. He saw how unhealthy my relationship with them was and how it was making me act and everything. So he sat me down and helped me itemize everything and as I tried to communicate these issues my entire life with deaf ears, it made sense to go nc.   


Since we knew each other before my decision, it wasn't anything major here, but we had no real interest in meeting either parents. It of course happened since we were both 16  at the time, but my parents were terrible and he didn't want to make me uncomfortable around his.   


In conclusion, if it weren't for my romance I may have never found the proper footing to abandon my disgusting family. The only family member I still am close to is my sister. You may come to find that what your family put you through is actually irrelevant to your romance, and feel stronger because of it.

Makes me wonder why she pushes away healthy relationships. All her life, she talks about people who were toxic and people her family tried to pull her away from, only to watch her burn herself over and over. She and I or she and you could have had such a beautiful life together, even with our illnesses. I can do it with my husband after all. Mental illness doesn't a bad person make. It makes life more of a challenge, but you can survive it and be a good person. She sees abusive people as strong, Imo. But when that abuse turns against her, when the money or whatever symbiosis stops benefitting her ends, suddenly she's on my side again. And I hear all your stories of being there and it only hardens my NC and confirms her being n. But I guess we all survived dad together, so there's that bond. Even though dad was her fault.

But, between you and my husband, I have found the strength in me to stay NC. I cannot stress that enough. I don't miss Stefan or dad. They were easy to let go of.

And I love you so much. I know you hit a rough patch and did what made sense to you at the time. You and your hubby will find your way. You're young and confused, but gradually getting to where you need to be. Hopefully we'll be neighbors, but I understand you got to go where life takes you."
