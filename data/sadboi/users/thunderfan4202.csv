Thunder,fowpfz0,t3_g9zen6,1588124416.0,We need a wing lock down shooter.  Saddiq Bey shot 45% from the  last year and 16ppg.  Jordan Nwora shot 40% and 28ppg both are projected to go around our Denver pick.   Also I really hope we pick up Markus Howard with a 2nd round pick.

Thunder,fo1ncbs,t3_g4s990,1587437080.0,From that article give me Jordan Nwora.  NBA draft. Net actually has him being mocked to the thunder at 27.  18ppg on 40% 3 point shooting.
schizoaffective,fo1ml5w,t1_fny2g68,1587436598.0,Thanks for the response.  I just felt like letting go of some steam.   Honestly I went in cuz I was incredibly manic and psychotic smoked weed and freaked out.  But it had been ongoing for awhile I went to another hospital a few weeks before that.  But honestly what I believe to have happened is incredibly difficult to understand and there's very little way to convince someone it's real yet I still believe it to be real.
Thunder,fo1lpwt,t1_fnxi5on,1587436049.0,There's a lot of guards in this draft and with 2 hot commodities on the trade block there's a good chance we can move up.   I don't see dort as a long term starter but a great utility piece like Marcus smart.  If he can shoot the 3 decently though he'll always start over Ferguson.
washingtondc,fo1gtx3,t3_g55k2s,1587432985.0,What's his name?  Put em on blast!
schizoaffective,fnxy8zu,t3_g4k3er,1587348973.0,I was hospitalized twice in the last 2 months.  Out of work for nearly a month.   They switched me from geodon to clozapine and I feel wonderful in the head.   My mania and anxiety is as gone as it's been in 3 or 4 years but I'm slower and I'm always starving.  I drool all day but I catch it and swallow while I'm awake.   At night it builds up in my mouth and I wake up choking on my own saliva.  Also I told the doctors that nothing would convince me that my delusions aren't real.   So either right now I'm one of the most insane people on the planet or I've experienced something supernatural a miracle I guess you should call.   Which makes matters worse cuz I truly despise religion in general and have studied christianity extensively enough to know that the God of the bible yahweh is up there with Hitler in being a monster to humanity.   So I'm no longer manic but extremely delusional and see no way that a pill will change that.
Thunder,fnxjly9,t1_fnxiuxu,1587339999.0,With how well our 3 pg lineup played this year I'd love to see a legit combo guard next to sga.  The way harden should've been next to Westbrook in okc
Thunder,fnxi00s,t1_fnxgus3,1587339031.0,"Supposed the Knicks cp3 rumors are true.   We get the Knicks pick in return for cp3.  We get a decent pick in return for Schroder.  Were looking at 2 to 3 picks next year.   I'd go after an elite playmaker Cole Anthony, Anthony Edwards, tyrese maxey"
Thunder,fnxhbig,t1_fnxgus3,1587338632.0,We need just about every position on this team going forward.  The only player that will be a long term starter on this team is sga and we could draft 1 2 or 3 and slide him over based on the other players skills.   Dort could be a long term starter but I view him more as a 2 or 3 depending on others roles.
Thunder,fnxgj8a,t3_g4gg0m,1587338161.0,I'd trade a future first and our Denver pick for just about anyone in the top ten.   I hope we give markus Howard a shot with our 2nd.

Thunder,fmpakki,t1_fmo7gxq,1586277443.0,True but then again they could be terrible picks
Thunder,fmkg86u,t1_fmkg0zy,1586153897.0,More picks now = a shorter rebuild.  Trading our only pick this year just extends the rebuild that much longer.   I'd throw around the 2024 to 2026 picks well cuz those guys are way past shais timeline.    But let's be honest Ferguson has no trade value.   Neither does Nader.  Which is why the picks are needed.
Thunder,fmkfxl4,t1_fmkfpd3,1586153616.0,Lauri is a solid starter in the league and were offering two players who should never be starters.  We could change to the 2026 first and the Memphis 2nd but idk if that's enough.
Thunder,fmkfhpl,t3_fv9tif,1586153200.0,I honestly have no idea who would want him other than the heat and philly.  We already know Miami won't work.  It's up to philly as to whether they really want to pay 28 mil per year for a backup center.  Perhaps Houston will want to go back to a traditional style and trade for gallinari for Gordon and tucker and the 2022 first.     Those are about the only teams I can see needing a pf and in the playoffs this year.   Lots of more appealing options on bad teams but he probably doesn't want to play for them.
Thunder,fmkefkl,t1_fmkecmo,1586152216.0,Eh then it'll have to be a guaranteed good player or a guaranteed good pick neither of which we have
Thunder,fmke7x8,t1_fmj1iid,1586152029.0,Pretty much any team he'd be willing to s&t won't have a good draft pick.   We'll have to go after a decent young player and a late first
Thunder,fmke356,t3_fvaabh,1586151910.0,With that pick I really want to go after marcus Howard from Marquette.  He's short and a 5 year guy but he averaged 27.8ppg this year on 41% from 3 and 22.6ppg for his career on 42.7% from 3 for his career on 7.9attempts per game.  He's currently projected in early to mid 2and round so maybe we could get him with a later pick but I hope he ends up on the thunder somehow.
Thunder,fmkdm8z,t1_fmjptus,1586151498.0,"I'd try to do anything to avoid sending bazely.  2 of Ferguson Nader diallo and 2 future firsts should hopefully get it done.

Thunder,fmgkzbl,t1_fmgksh8,1586051350.0,I feel the players would be very upset with that outcome.   Anyway there's a good chance we either keep gallinari or get a good sign & trade out of it.
Thunder,fmgj55f,t1_fmgihou,1586050214.0,True but if we don't get the pick I at least want to see how we do in the first and second round.  Now going into next year we have a taxpayer mle and the 25th pick and 51st pick.   And that's given we keep everyone else on the current team.   That's still not a contender.  On the other hand if we keep that pick we can use the 3 picks to move up in the draft and possibly go after that Knicks pick.

1) if John Wall returns to form
  A) keep the team similar to as is currently constructed and extend Bertans to a solid contract
2) if John wall isn't going to return to form
 A) trade Bradley Beal for a young player and a few picks similar to pg13 or Westbrook.  Sign and trade Bertans if possible
