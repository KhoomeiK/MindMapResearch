TrueAtheism,fmax7hy,t1_fmasspc,1585911361.0,Very true. My vision of ‚ÄúHell‚Äù pales in comparison to what it‚Äôs like to be stalked. Unless there are appointed stalkers in Hell who strangle you for all of eternity... lol
TrueAtheism,fmax3j5,t1_fmawhoy,1585911239.0,"I thought this through and I don‚Äôt know. I can‚Äôt think of anything I feel guilt for. I have never physically harmed another person in my life. I volunteer with animals and abused women. I do everything I can for my friends, I spend lots of time with my family. I provided live in care for my 98 year old grandmother while she was dying. I‚Äôve saved a persons life. I‚Äôve been loyal to any romantic partners... I really do make an effort to be genuine and kind to people. If anything, bad things have happened to me that have tainted my view of the world but I don‚Äôt think I harbor any self blame, unless it‚Äôs very repressed. 

I feel bad for silly things from the past - rolling my eyes at my grandma when I was a kid, or not walking my childhood dog every single day. The ‚Äúbad‚Äù things I‚Äôve done have always been stereotypical rebellious teen stuff that never hurt anyone. So I really don‚Äôt know. I would imagine someone who has such horrid visions of hellscapes would have some dark secret honestly üòÖ

It would make sense if I had deep seated religious guilt of some kind, or was raised by believers who drilled the idea of Hell into my mind, but neither of those things apply so it was an odd experience."
TrueAtheism,fmavc9n,t1_fmav60w,1585909275.0,"Very true! I was thinking, Hell would naturally be thought to be the most horrifying concept imaginable - and in periods of extreme distress that‚Äôs probably what your brain would conjure up.

TrueAtheism,fmav9xc,t1_fmaufwt,1585909199.0,"I am in therapy! Sadly that wasn‚Äôt my first trauma rodeo üòÖ 

I have always had constant existential crises. I remember  being 3 years old and realizing I would die one day. Honestly, I‚Äôve been a witness to lots of unfortunate accidents and from a young age I had seen people die and became interested in the nature of consciousness and human existence. 

I study psychology and forensic science and I‚Äôm kind of a morbid person I feel. I try to conceptualize my own death way too often and get into a thought loop where I feel this overwhelming feeling of ‚ÄúNOTHING MAKES SENSE WHAT IS MY BRAIN HOW DO HUMANS EXIST‚Äù and the fact that I study dead bodies and see the reality of death and decay makes a weird combo of seeing death rationally but still fearing the unfathomable concept of my existence some day stopping. 

DMT flooding during death is so interesting to me. I tend to see my experience as equivalent to like a ‚Äúbad trip‚Äù whereas most people have a nice warm fuzzy one where they see Jesus and all their dead relatives or whatever."
TrueAtheism,fmauqde,t1_fmatf2b,1585908591.0,"This is actually the advice I got from my philosophy teacher, lol. Honestly, I‚Äôve always in a way wished I was religious because religious people always seemed so... sure of the nature of their own existence. I imagine it‚Äôs probably amazing to feel like your existence is inherently meaningful and the universe isn‚Äôt completely baffling. But I just can‚Äôt wrap my head around the idea of ‚Äúbecoming‚Äù religious. It‚Äôs just not something my brain agrees with. If I engaged in religious behavior like prayer, the entire time I would be doubting it and feeling ridiculous, which I feel kind of negates the purpose. If anything, I imagine God would find me kind of condescending if I faked it."
TrueAtheism,fmaue23,t1_fmatvwb,1585908211.0,"Somewhat unrelated to my original post but I gotta say: Interesting that you brought up recurring visions while on DMT. I‚Äôve always been interested in similar topics. When I did LSD for the first time, I saw intricate symbols and figures that I now recognize as Aztec in origin, and when I looked it up it seemed to be a common thing. On certain substances people see things like machinery/wiring, hieroglyphics, specific figures and imagery, etc. Very fascinating to say the least. 

What you said is generally my thought process. I hear a lot about people almost dying and feeling a sense of calm and acceptance, and having pleasant NDEs. My experience was completely opposite - I was in immense pain and fear and was DEFINITELY not ready to go at 16 years old. I think that fear (and maybe even the ‚Äúburning‚Äù feeling of choking) caused it. Basically the concept of Hell is the most horrifying thing people could come up with to get people to adhere to a certain moral code, so it makes sense that that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd see in the worst moment of my life. 

I have always had existential woes I guess and always get overwhelmed trying to comprehend the concept of my own non-existence, so almost dying and having a markedly unpleasant experience definitely didn‚Äôt help, lol"

It was still REALLY difficult to find a time someone would want to model. Me personally, I would model for an hour for some free food, lol so if you have a friend who is willing I recommend that. It's always nice to see something on a person, and certain things might be really nice but just don't have that hanger/mannequin appeal. 

I personally gave up on having people model and just use a mannequin or nice wood hanger for things that can't be on a mannequin. I do think things sell better when modeled but it's not completely necessary."
