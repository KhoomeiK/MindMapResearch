But to me it wasn’t unwarranted, this has happened several times to the same place and just calling the police obviously wasn’t enough to keep the robbers away. So to me this was the communities pent up anger and these two idiots shouldn’t have been surprised to get fucked up after trying to steal more money from the community.

Edit: Also..do you think anyone tried robbing this place after this? No? Then it worked..again if you steal other people’s hard earned money, expect to get your shit kicked in."

Like honestly this poor place has been robbed several times and people are seriously calling this unwarranted? Also if this could even be justified “they have a sick mom that needs medical-attention” or some shit, the people inside the place have to go through as much shit as these two fucking idiots. Robbers rob because they think people are scared of them if this doesn’t send the message that people are done with their bullshit literally nothing else can.
