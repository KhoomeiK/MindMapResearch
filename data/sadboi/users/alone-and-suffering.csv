dating_advice,fqrwtpi,t1_fqruach,1589593585.0,"I think I'm more of the ""testing the waters"" type right now and feel like I'll know more on the second date. 

But as someone else said, if I'm looking to pursue then I shouldn't have sex with the other because it shows that I'm not ready. That combined with what you said about feeling guilty later on.

I do appreciate your reply 'cause it made me realize that if I'm even asking this question then I might want to play my cards right. Which would mean pursuing the girl I'm actually interested to be with instead of following my dick.

There's been a lot of ""what if this or what if that?""-questions going around my head. But what you guys said helps seeing it more clearly! Thank you!"
dating_advice,fqruh50,t1_fqrtkns,1589592154.0,"Yeah I agree with concentrating on one person but since it's through tinder it feels like there's loose ends. Would I notice that she and I were looking for the same thing after the second date then I would concentrate on her.

But since it's only been one date and the plans got cancelled for the second one I got kind of lost."

Whenever I get it I begin to feel it in my legs, like in the calves and on the backside of my knees. Which then climbs up my body raising my heartbeat and I get tremors both in my legs and hands. Also the cold sweats, can't forget about those.

Anxiety,fovq0ux,t3_g9rgmu,1588105541.0,"I know what you mean about this bad feeling coming back every once in a few weeks.

I've been feeling great with the sun out and not a worry in the world! Got some bad news this weekend and now I feel myself moving into the bad week again. You can sort of tell from the beginning.

It starts with the mild anxiety that just gets slightly worse day by day. Hopefully I'll do something positive that changes its course."

Anxiety,f3mactm,t3_dhcit1,1570985434.0,"I understand what you mean. That feeling really takes a toll on you as well.

I recently took some pretty big steps in my life. I started studying at university, I moved out from my parents to a new city and I finally live my own life. I love it all. Yet the surrounding world feels threatening and I always wonder what I'm doing wrong, what people think of me. Should I just hide in my apartment and hide from the world or should I get to know people and experience this new life I just got?

Being lost in your head fucking sucks and I guess that's why we feel out of place."
offmychest,ey2lpi0,t3_cv2zr9,1566742765.0,"I'm right there with you. Had feelings develop for a girl this past year and the feelings became so strong that she was the only thing I could think about. Told her but she wasn't sure if she felt the same way. Didn't see her for a while and the feelings sort of started to fade. Met her again yesterday and it all came back and hit me like a train. Now I'm moving for uni and won't see her for a while. I don't know what to do...

It fucking sucks, especially because it's so hard to move on as well. Love is like a curse and a blessing at the same time.

Hope you can get through it and move on."
relationship_advice,exgfza4,t3_csi07o,1566263082.0,"I'll say the same as everyone else. Just go with the flow.

Your sexuality doesn't need to be defined when you're young. It's something you realize along the way, regardless of how old you are.

If you feel the spark then you feel the spark which might help you realize your feelings. If you don't then you don't. Either way is perfectly fine."
Anxiety,exgdx5k,t1_exgaur4,1566261585.0,"I'm not promoting drug use, you do what you want with your body. Everyone is different and drugs should be very well respected. They can easily fuck you up.

But personally, weed helps me a lot. If I feel stressed, depressed or have anxiety, weed can get me back on track for a few days. After a while I start to feel those feelings again. But sometimes it's positive to recognize and feel them to be able to move on. Using it every day is a slippery slope into addiction.

But as a rule of thumb, all drugs are more addictive than you think. You only realize you're addicted when you're in too deep."

depression,eta3vbp,t3_can03r,1562611619.0,"I think it started around freshman year in high school.

- Bully pushed me up against the wall, almost choking me, threatening that he would beat me up. Ran away with tears in my eyes afterwards. Felt like everyone at school thought I was a wimp and a weirdo.

- Told my first crush that I liked her, she said we should talk about it. We didn't because I got anxiety because of it. Later found her in bed with my then best friend when we were at a party. I didn't drink but my friends got really drunk at that party and both of them threw up. I told them that it can't be good whatsoever to be drinking when you're young. They told me that I should start to let loose because everyone is doing it.

- Got heavily into weed in my senior years of high school because it helped with my depression. I might've been too young for it though. Tried LSD the last semester of my senior year and was a mess the morning after. I cried myself to sleep that morning.

- After graduating I wanted to get a girlfriend and tried to put myself out there. My anxiety came back in full bloom in fear of rejection.

- I now work a stressful job in retail which has it's ups and downs.

I feel better now after my teenage years but I still get depressed from time to time. I confessed my feelings to a close friend of mine but we said we should leave it open and see what happens. I won't see her for another 3 weeks since we're both on vacation but I miss her already. I want to talk about those feelings with someone and I've tried, but all I want is to talk about it with her. The uncertainty is bringing the anxiety back.

This turned out to be more than I had planned to write but it feels nice to get it off my chest."
