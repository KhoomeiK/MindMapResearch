tonightsdinner,f9ehgtd,t3_e0ccj5,1575244264.0,Another awesome food post! Just wanted to say you are literally the only person I follow on reddit. I came across your posts through a cooking sub and have been obsessed ever since! You've got mad plating skills. Where do you get your recipes?
Austin,f2v86mp,t1_f2upjmg,1570448122.0,Dang. How the f is anyone supposed to switch jobs
Austin,f2umnng,t3_ddze1z,1570420882.0,Is it a common thing here for employers to make new hires wait 3 months for health insurance?
OCD,f1ogdnk,t3_da1krn,1569644578.0,I feel understood ðŸ˜‚
Accutane,ezvbtgb,t3_d2hvxt,1568172791.0,"It's normal and harmless on accutane. I got a few spots like these. Just keep them moisturized, and mention them to your derm during your next appointment if you're concerned. Good luck!"
relationship_advice,ezho3gd,t3_d11xqd,1567913297.0,Just tell him you're brandi and then say you're breaking up with him
Accutane,eyxbh63,t1_eyxbdem,1567549214.0,Thanks :)
Accutane,eyxajkm,t1_eyxa9tb,1567548570.0,Did you get lipiflow too?
Accutane,eyxahnf,t1_eyxa9tb,1567548535.0,30 mg for month 1 and 2 and then 60 mg for months 3 - 5
Accutane,eywyn2e,t1_eywxn2n,1567540850.0,I dont appreciate the judgy tone btw. I'm glad I went on accutane but this eye thing has been a real bummer for me
Accutane,eywy58s,t1_eywxn2n,1567540539.0,"It wasnt eye surgery. It's an outpatient procedure that took 20 minutes and cost $500. I got it at the urging of my doctor because my glands were so blocked that no amount of home care (hot compress, oil, steroids, eye ""massage"") could unblock them. We identified this problem months ago and I waited until I was finished with the drug to undergo the procedure. If you cant get the glands unblocked, then you can ""lose"" them (permanent damage), according to my doctor."
Accutane,eywxgqm,t1_eywwc2u,1567540112.0,I went off of it a month ago. Skin is still clear
Accutane,eywuaj3,t1_eywu4bs,1567538067.0,For the past few months. Meibobiam gland dysfunction. I was having constant watering eyes due to the oil glands being clogged. They said it was caused by Accutane. I had to get an expensive procedure done to prevent permanent damage (Lipiflow). Now they tell me I have to drink flax seed oil or use omega 3 fish oil supplements AND use a bruder mask every night FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
Accutane,eywnetq,t3_cz6myu,1567533494.0,Accutane is great...except for the permanent dry dye it caused me ðŸ˜¬
EatCheapAndHealthy,eyccdhw,t1_eybb0fo,1566999854.0,This comment makes me sad :(
AmItheAsshole,evkg02t,t3_ck0j7m,1564580924.0,"YTA. why didn't you get the pharmacist on duty, a manager, or call corporate? Aside from giving a minor life saving medication being the morally RIGHT thing to do, not doing so could cause Walgreens or whatever pharmacy you work at a PR crisis should this teenager take to social media"
Accutane,evb1h3h,t3_cj2u1i,1564363188.0,Honestly you just need time
AmItheAsshole,eut6da1,t1_eur45i8,1564020803.0,"He's young and immature, just like you at age 17 when you made your mistake of cheating. Remember the compassion you want for yourself at that age? Give it to him too. Good luck with therapy"
AmItheAsshole,eut5toc,t3_chb37s,1564020477.0,"All assholes, but in this order from most to least: You, Hunter, Connor. You are putting your teenage brother on the streets because he put his foot in his mouth at a party. Making him relive probably one of the biggest traumas of his life. Shame on you! I hope things get better for you and your brother."
bipolar,euqths4,t3_cgwj4a,1563985047.0,Bipolar is not a personality disorder!
SkincareAddiction,etqcv30,t3_ccr9ok,1563080059.0,Pore strip maybe?

Accutane,eq2itxf,t3_bx1z4c,1559738054.0,Use a bruder mask
Accutane,epd39af,t3_bujih9,1559161486.0,Taking each pill with a fatty meal or snack helps with absorption and significantly reduces the risk of acne relapse. I usually aim for about 20 grams. Just never take it on an empty stomach.
Accutane,eosrzrh,t3_bsgj2a,1558828257.0,i have been noticing just recently (5 months in) extra sweating in that small dip in between my nose and lips
