Our temps were taken before we could enter. Teacher’s are back only to close out classrooms and ready the rooms for summer camp if that becomes possible. We are only there for a few hours a day. 

As far as the children go, the parents are not allowed inside of the building where the children are. Even the teachers with children. Only childcare staff and admin can enter. Children’s temps are taken before they enter. Things left behind in the car or forgotten at home must stay home. There is no entering the building and the campus is locked after 9am."

The first day he wore it I got itchy, my lips burned, lost my voice and my palms turned red and broke out with eczema immediately. It’s important to note that I see several classes a day. I’m not with the same group of children. The second day I had the full-on anaphylaxis and was given permission to give the parents a call. We initially thought they were putting some type of cologne on him as the scent is strong and perfumey. The first phone call seemed to go well. Mom said it was not a cologne and must be a hair product but couldn't be sure which one as they use several. She seemed helpful and offered to eliminate products to pinpoint which one it might be that I was reacting to. The next school day I had another severe reaction and called mom to touch base. Long story short the parents’ tone had changed and racial prejudice was being insinuated. I stepped away from the situation quickly and decided to let the administration step in and handle things from there.  After a meeting with the administration, the child was moved up a grade level (the parents wanted this and we're pushing for this) to help everyone involved. The problem is that he’s still in the same building and I’m still having reactions. Also, minor reactions to other perfumed beauty products I’ve had in the past are now more severe when I’m at work.

At the moment I’m taking three different antihistamines a day, Zantac twice daily (prescribed by the allergist) and I’m needing to use an asthma inhaler along with the EpiPen. I DO NOT have asthma. The reaction is most severe in my lungs. I was also prescribed singular but had a bad reaction to it and had to.atop taking it.

aww,eyjhd9k,t1_eyikvfl,1567119199.0,I respectfully disagree. I work at a school with a barn. We would occasionally take on cats from a catch and release program from an urban area. The cats would be released at out at our barn to help with rats. Some cats would be so friendly they would make their way up to the school and start getting into trouble and need rehoming. I've seen a few cats go through this process and have one myself. He’s a like a Labrador retriever trapped inside of a cat. My guy kept trying to get inside of the classrooms to hang with the kids.  He was caught with his mother and all of his brothers and sisters. Several of his siblings went home with teachers or students for being too friendly.

BipolarReddit,ey4yrih,t3_cvhqxk,1566815030.0,"My father was prescribed an antidepressant after his retirement.  Before the meds, he was a gentle introvert and very careful with his spending. His behavior moved quickly from sort of strange to bizarre and aggressive. He bought 2 mustangs, a Cadillac and a trailer in another state over a two month period. He became paranoid, agitated and dangerous. He was diagnosed with late-onset bipolar in May of 2018 and took his life in September. I’m terrified that I have this sleeping inside of me as well."

pitbulls,ew5sysf,t3_cm5dp0,1565144322.0,Is splooting a thing for pit bulls? I’m noticing a lot of shooting pics here and not-so-much on the Shih Tzu subreddit. Our little lady loves to sploot.
pitbulls,ew1fqh7,t1_ew0xxpz,1565022448.0,This is an excellent observation!
pitbulls,ew0ijhk,t3_cm5dp0,1564990621.0,"Thanks, guys! We are enjoying her. She’s a sweetheart and eager to please."
pitbulls,ew0ifor,t1_ew07nbp,1564990477.0,She’s 4 months and 16 lbs with some growing to do. Not sure how much though. The shelter mentioned that she had not grown any during the month she spent with them.  Her paws look like she needs to grow into them but I’ve noticed that Shih Tzus seem to have large front paws.
