 I will say some of the instances where you have assumed people have stop and stared in public or said nasty things are self assumed from your hyper awareness since youâ€™ve already been hurt so much. Iâ€™m sure people have stared or you caught them in the act of making heinous comments, thatâ€™s just people. I have a lot of popular friends and people say the darkest most terrible things about their actions and physicality as well. People are nasty nasty, projecting with in. What Iâ€™m trying to say if youâ€™re participating in this game of life you will get hurt, you will get insulted, and most of the time it will be unjustified, and to try to not take it personal...even when it is. 

I feel like I didnâ€™t help at all. But everything youâ€™re telling me sounds like common practice in this world. I hope you find a solution to your smell problem, and I could see youâ€™re world turning the light on if you can get to the bottom of it whether you solve it or not. 

Thanks for listening"
