Take the little filter/sieve bit out of the spout too and drop it into the pot and boom, clean after one boil. The more limescale the more lemon and water you'll need obviously but it works great. White vinegar will probably work too but you'll need to boil a few more kettle-loads of just water to get rid of the smell and taste. Much cheaper than descaling solutions and most people have one or the other at home.




One of my simple lockdown pleasures has been watching our clear kettle descaling in this way... Joy.




Edit: Typo."

Our beagle doesn't behave in exactly the same way, but watch for the fur alone his back raising - that's a sign of genuine distress/aggression where he's trying to make himself appear larger and more threatening.



Here he seems to understand that there's a puppy and he can't actually hurt them, but if I were you I'd just try to assure your older dog with pets.



Is the puppy getting any sort of socialisation outside of your older dog? If not I'd suggest it, so he can experience different behaviours and how to act in different situations. If he is, maybe try taking them both out together to a dog park and see how they both act in social situations, maybe your older dog just doesn't have as much energy as the puppy does and is trying to tell him.




To be honest, I'm not reading this as aggression - I'm reading this as a dog trying to assert his boundaries. If I were you, I'd try to maybe keep the noise level slightly lower as this might be either/both egging on the puppy and/or stressing the older dog out slightly. 



I hope that doesn't come across the wrong way, and I hope that helps. If something doesn't make sense, please ask, and I'm sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile."
