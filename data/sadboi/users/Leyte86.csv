DobermanPinscher,fq1lzm7,t3_gfm74y,1589046830.0,Good to know.  I love the Euro look with a medium crop.  I think it fits their build better.  And your puppy looks like the perfect mix between a cherub and a gargoyle.  So cute!  Take lots of pictures.  Time goes by fast.
DobermanPinscher,fq1jxnf,t3_gg33it,1589046321.0,"My parents have two Jack Russell males and one female(kept a puppy from the first litter).  The first few years they got along fine.  After the father got sick from a tic bite, they constantly try to fight.  The son probably sensed weakness and saw the opportunity to gain dominance.  They can no longer keep the two males in the same area."
DobermanPinscher,fpzkr20,t3_gfm74y,1589019586.0,What posting method is this?  I’ve only seen tubing/tampon wraps.
DogCare,fpl58yc,t3_gdu8rd,1588706599.0,When checking for fleas I look around the armpit and groin area to see if there are any pink spots.  Fleas like those areas.  Or spread some fur around the back to see if you see anything tiny run away.  If it’s fleas you can use Dawn dish soap(or any other) to kill the fleas if you’re unable to get flea meds/bath.  The dish soap is drying though so I only recommend it when it’s your only option.  If you don’t see fleas it might be some other skin condition.  So a trip to the vet might be a good idea.  You can also get their first puppy vet visit out if the way too if you haven’t already.  I think in most places vets are an essential service so they should at least be open for drop off appointments.
DobermanPinscher,fpiz8me,t1_fpih77j,1588652330.0,"I’m guessing OP might be from a place where they don’t dock or crop?  In the US, it is much harder to find since the standard is different.  I’ve only seen natural Dobermans in rescues here.  You may be able to find a breeder that gives you the option not to crop though.  Just make sure they prioritize health testing.  Either way Doberman puppies are so cute.  I hope to have one in the future."
popping,fphpv92,t3_gdd8x3,1588625623.0,I think my coworker has this.  He had to completely cut out nightshades from his diet and it helped him out a lot.  But any hint of nightshade in any food and it flares back up.  I think he got the elimination diet idea after reading [The Hidden Plague ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/173267454X/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_C.hSEbYSYF3E9) Good pop though.  I hope you can get it under control

TeslaModel3,fjlnxll,t1_fjljhuc,1583450508.0,Actually I was considering the 3D maxpiders but then the the Tesla liners came out.  The only thing about maxpiders is the 3D logo and I didn’t want to support that other brand that pretty much ripped off the look of the maxpiders minus the logo.  By gaming chair I mean the designs and branding might be a bit over the top and don’t quite fit the look of the three.  I think Tesmania branding is too much and the drainage lines would look better in a truck or a Jeep.  That’s just my personal taste.  And I live in a place without much rain so the simple Tesla liners work for me.  In the end just choose what you like... I just hope to god it’s not carpet.
TeslaModel3,fjl98ht,t1_fjl7mns,1583442371.0,Yeah the Tesla All Weather floor liners are my favorite so far.  They fit with the minimalist look of the interior.  I don’t want my car floor looking like a gaming chair.

SuicideWatch,fi9jofz,t3_f6vgg2,1582268422.0,Depression seems to run on my family.  I’ve had suicidal thoughts ever since the 5th grade(in my 30s now).  I always thought I would be the first to really go until my sister overdosed on pills.  She had to get her stomach pumped and spent some time in a psychiatric ward.  Since we live in the US she was left with thousands of dollars of medical debt.  This was maybe 10 years ago.  She’s doing a lot better now.  In a happy relationship and has a baby on the way.  My cousin’s son lost his battle with depression.  He shot himself.  Every year my cousin does remembrance walk for her son and suicide awareness.  Seeing both outcomes really keeps me from doing anything.   I still get the intrusive thoughts about killing myself but I do the best to make it through.  I don’t want to make anyone sad.
TeslaModel3,fi89bmy,t1_fi7e0f2,1582235859.0,No problem.  I wish I took more photos though.  I only thought of posting after I got the adhesive off of the dead pedal.  I went with the RPM Tesla pedal because Abstract ocean’s currently has slots built for the previous gen dead pedals.  If they release something with rubber grips (RPM’s is like grip tape you find on a skateboard) I might swap it.  Luckily with Velcro that’ll be easy.
TeslaModel3,fi5fmid,t3_f6l5we,1582162045.0,"[Process here](https://imgur.com/a/iglaK9S)

I hate carpet.  I finally got around to installing the Dead Pedal from RPM Tesla.  The dead pedal comes with 3M adhesive but I wanted to be able to clean behind it.  I blasted the adhesive with my hair dryer so peeling it off was easy.  It doesn’t have to be perfect, just not lumpy.  After I got it nice and flat I stuck on a bunch of industrial strength Velcro(hooked side only).  It seems to grip perfectly.  I guess I’ll find out once I get driving.  I like the Tesla All Weather Floor liners so that souls make it a bit more secure."

politics,fek4egz,t1_fek0a8r,1579192370.0,"I think when it comes to primaries, it may differ by state and party on who gets to vote for the next party nominee.  Some primaries are closed to party members and some let independents vote.  It’s different than the final presidential race where you can vote for whatever party you want.  I use to be No Party Preference here in California, but changed it to a D... because I want to be as far away from the dumpster fire as possible.  I’ll most likely be voting Bernie in the Democratic primaries."

TeslaModel3,fdc9o2l,t3_ekli4m,1578269855.0,Got my center counsel wrapped in satin PPF and decided to add on some rim guards as well.  I had my boyfriend drive the car back from the installer (I like him driving when we’re together) and right when he turns on our home street he hits the rear passenger curb going too fast for the guards to anything.  The guard covers up most of the evidence.  He’s lucky I’ve been eyeing some black TSportlines so I’m not angry... just bummed.  Will probably get new rims when it’s time for new tires.
