sex,fdfafuk,t3_eksqt2,1578357079.0,I know it's nothing much but my boyfriend has always wanted to try anal and it hurt every single time! Today I decided I would try with a toy about the same size as him and it didnt hurt at all it felt really good! I sent him a video and I'm just so excited! I thought we wouldn't be able to ever do anal and it made me feel really bad about myself. I cant wait for him to get home but I'm putting on the lube this time :)

relationship_advice,eogk0ie,t1_eogilv3,1558559513.0,Hm. That's a good point he did say one of the reasons he couldn't stand her was the constant nagging. I think you're right I should probably leave it be. :) glad you're with a good lady now too!
relationship_advice,eoggwmi,t1_eogg9ta,1558557704.0,I dont know. I've never thought about it really. I've clean seasonally so when I do and I see that stuff I see it as a chapter in life that has ended. Since my relationships ending has always been final and mutual (even if I have to explain my reasoning) I thought it was the nice thing to do to give them their stuff back and other gifts that may be expensive or meaningful to them. If it's something like a letter or stuffed animal or photos I just clear the space in my home for new things and new memories. Kind of like clothes you dont wear anymore or furniture that doesnt fit with the rest of the furniture in the room so I remove it. I've given some gifts that have been given to me away to so others can enjoy them
relationship_advice,eogfc2d,t1_eogey0s,1558556803.0,I'm worried if I bring it up he will think I'm being overbearing which I guess I can see. He does stay in contact with her sometimes but hes very trustworthy. I just want to make sure hes moved on before we move forward
relationship_advice,eogf58k,t1_eogesdr,1558556692.0,Thanks :) I guess I just do things differently. I dont want to forget my exs but I've always either given things back of thrown them away. I'm sure it won't be a problem but it's good to know other people do this too
relationship_advice,eogf088,t1_eogertn,1558556610.0,"Oh, when we moved we left in a hurry so he shoved the bag of hair ties in the container along with some stuff that was also in the closet it was stored in!"
