He was getting aggressive and she didn‚Äôt think she had a lot of time and he would hear her making a phone call so she called the daughter saying something like ‚Äúhope you‚Äôre having a good day at work, I love you‚Äù then whispered that he was going to kill her and to call 911. So basically she didn‚Äôt have an option because if she called 911 he would have heard her right away and wouldn‚Äôt have enough time to explain the situation or he would take the phone the second he heard the ‚Äú911, what is your emergency?‚Äù"

If it is someone who doesn‚Äôt have friends/family that you have no connection to, you could literally burry them in a random field far away without any ID, and after thoroughly cleaning any evidence it was you. 

Whatever situation you can always burn the body to the best of your abilities and throw it in a lake, or once again, burry it far away. If you burn the body or dismembered it to the point where they cant identify it (no finger prints, teeth, obviously a distinct face, or other features etc) I would say its pretty safe. Just make sure you werent caught socializing with them, and your car or whatever isnt in security cameras near the body if it ever got discovered."
