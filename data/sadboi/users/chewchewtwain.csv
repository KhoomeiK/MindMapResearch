It was so long ago I can’t remember what exactly the meal was, but I do remember it being three courses, all made from scratch. She was so nervous it was honestly adorable.

AskReddit,floxfil,t3_fpyb6k,1585347455.0,"I worked in fast food very briefly. It was a Wendy’s in an industrial park. I was there maybe two months. Management was shit. Which is to be expected. I’d worked like 10 days straight because people kept calling in sick. It was end of my shift. I was on cleaning duty. This included changing the fryers. I slipped in the back storage area and bumped my head pretty good while mopping. My manager came back and told me to brush it off because “you’re almost done!”. I relented and kept cleaning. When it came time to change the fryers, I had the whole shit set up, shoulda been a breeze. I bent down to open the valve to drain them, and the cheap ass work pants they give us, split from below my knee, to my nutsack. In plain view of customers. I quickly got up and ran to the back. I explained to my manager what had happened. She hands me TWO safety pins to hold this 1 metre tear closed and tells me to get back to it. I look at my hand with the pins, then her, then the shithole I’m working in. I toss the safety pins on her desk, throw my hat in the fryers that aren’t quite drained and knock over a rack of buns. I walked over an hour before I managed to hitch a ride home.... somehow still got my last paycheque from them."
