While it's definitely not a typical one, your relationship is your business and no one should judge you for that. Only the three of you know what happened so only the three of you have the right to decide what happens next.

That being said, your ex is clearly still upset about how your relationship turned out. After visiting home several times as an adult, no mature person would be upset about their childhood room being repurposed. He's using this opportunity as an excuse to vent his anger with you.

Again, not knowing the personal details of what happened between you all, it might be best to seek some type of counseling or shut out your ex completely. You're in a very complicated situation that will only get worse if not dealt with carefully. Good luck"

Baby steps. Force yourself to think about each decision you make as the situation happens. Literally every decision. If you think about completing a short task long enough, you realize you could have already done it so making the decision to do it is much easier. 

For longer tasks, set a timer. Do 10 minutes at a time. Keep up the effort as long as you possibly can. The more you do things you typically hate, you realize it's actually not so bad and the decision to do those tasks becomes easier in the future.

Unfortunately, our brains are essentially addicted to feeling good right now instead of in the future. So we give up on anything that will delay that chemical reaction. After a while of mindful thinking and decision making, each decision slowly starts to become easier, even second nature.

AmItheAsshole,fjguk5h,t3_fd6a1h,1583335789.0,"NAH. It's understandable that you would like to name your child after someone very special to you and important in your life. It's also understandable that your fiancé would be so upset because, duh, she's pregnant and to be honest, she's right. 

It sounds like you're still grieving for your ex, which is a sign that you shouldn't be marrying someone else and starting a family yet. Typically, when someone becomes your ex you move on and forget about that person. But you refusing to let go of what could have been proves to her that you're not content with the now.

In traditional relationships, it's one at a time. Most people don't understand the concept of loving more than one romantic partner at a time. Most people also don't understand what it's like to lose a partner. So they imagine it's similar to a regular break up,  ""that person is gone from my life. I'll just move on.""

Your fiancé feels that you love your ex and not her. You mentioning that you still think about your ex shows her that the possible relationship you lost is more important than your current relationship with her.

Obviously it's hard, but you need to move on already. Humans are always caught up in the ""what ifs"" but sometimes there's simply no descernable answer and you have to accept that. It's time to let go of the past my friend. 

I hope the two of you can work this out and I wish you luck. Congratulations on becoming a father."

I also discovered that my mother has a severe case of borderline personality disorder and that I have it too. Suddenly, every pathetic decision I ever made my entire made complete sense.

I've been on depression/anxiety medication for the past four years which has mostly taken care of my emotional issues. I have executive functioning issues I'm constantly battling but at least I'm happy for the first time in my life."

AskReddit,fijj9e8,t1_fiicbn2,1582450566.0,That's interesting. Pharmacies here have become a mix of all things health related and part convenience store
BPD,fia8x7u,t3_f75f8o,1582295886.0,"I'm mulatto. My mom is black and the one with severe bpd. My dad was mostly physically and completely emotionally absent during my childhood.

It's nice to feel connected to others like yourself. I'm only generalizing, but I imagine the type of abuse is different for every culture. Sometimes it is hard to relate with people who's parents acted completely different."

I'm so completely useless I feel like a burden to those around me"

childfree,fi760b7,t1_fi6tf88,1582215010.0,"I'm so sorry for your loss. I got my cat before her eyes were even open. I had to have a friend's mom baby sit her during the day when I was in school for the first two weeks of her life. I bottle feed her. I taught her to use the potty. If *that's* not parenting, then WTF is? 

Fuck those people. Your angel was just as precious to you as any human child. No one is allowed to tell someone else how to grieve."
