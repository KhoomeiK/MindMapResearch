But the fact that you consider this an achievement makes it a very large one indeed. Many people go through life without considering the need to the impulse to harm themselves; but the fact that you do feel these impulses, and that you have overcome them for such an extended duration of time deserves at the very least the happiness we all feel that you're safe and alive for another day."

Also, if you don't mind a minor update from my side, things are going well with my particular someone, and we've gotten close again, at least as friends. That gives me hope for you and your situation. My sincere best wishes for you :)"
