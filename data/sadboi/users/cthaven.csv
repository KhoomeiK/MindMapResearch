AvPD,fr2d7ew,t1_fr1jwku,1589835268.0,"I never got a lot of therapy for avpd, because the last year has been a lot. I got diagnosed, then I had a crisis and another crisis and another crisis, so we never really got to try to work on it. Thats also why I am confused why they decided to remove it. Its not that it is so important to me to have this specific diagnosis, I would be happy if I didnt. Its just that when I got it, it felt so correct. I felt so validated. I just agreed so much that this is what I have, and when they removed it it feels like nothing I ever said about it is valid. 

I’m happy to try therapy for my ptsd (or obviously not happy, cause you know, hard work://) but I still think that this isn’t the foot of my issues. 

I’m sure a lot of this is just me overreacting, it just came as a shock cause the last year I have been aware that this is what I have. This is what I am struggling with, and suddenly its not. I’m sorry if anything sounds attention seeking or invalidating/rude to the people who actually have avpd. Thats not my intention at all <3"
AvPD,fr29zjn,t1_fr1zkvr,1589833689.0,"Yeah but I dont agree with them. I relate so much to the avoidant diagnosis, there was never a doubt to me that it was correct.

When its actually used as an antipsychotic its usually prescribed 300-800mg, so this low of a dose usually isnt anything to worry about. My psych told me its very commonly used for insomnia, and in a lot of cases it works great. Try it out and see if it works for you, but either way its always okay to ask about it!

AvPD,fp9j5gs,t3_gc5mvj,1588427533.0,"I was first diagnosed with social anxiety. I think I still do have that, but I also have avpd. For me the way I think about it is that social anxiety is being scared of attention. Not necessarily having any reason, but just not wanting any attention especially in a negative way. But avpd is not only being so scared of attention from others, but just believing that I am not good enough so I dont want people to notice me and for me to take up space. I still think you can have both and its very common.

Try to think about why you are anxious in social setting. Is it because you are scared of doing something wrong or that people will laugh at you, or is it just the fact that people will see you and you dont deserve to take up space because everything you do is wrong. I would bring it up with your therapist, it never hurts to ask."

psychoanalysis,fnzuabb,t3_g4v8qw,1587400871.0,"Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder which can make you have hallucinations. Which means, you can hear voices and even see things which arent there. Sometimes its difficult to realize that the things you see and hear aren’t real, which can make you act on the things «they» tell you. Psychosis is similar but it is usually for a short period of time, from days to months. Also, most people aren’t aware when they are psychotic. So claiming that you are psychotic probably isn’t that believable.

DID also comes to mind. Dissociative identity disorder means that your brain has made up different personalities that you switch between. Not on purpose of course, but when you get triggere. 

My personal opinion, but I think you should go with schizophrenia."

Or try to do some cbt on yourself, but it can obviously be really hard since you believe these things. Ask yourself, what evidence do I have for this belief. And what evidence do you have for it not to be true. It can be really helpful to write it down"
Psychosis,flomw3e,t3_fq30rf,1585341391.0,"No. The medication is only to help you. The worst thing that can happen is that they don’t work, but they can not be used to monitor your thoughts. I understand that you feel like that and it is very scary, but it is not possible. They exist to help you, thats it."
AvPD,flomijs,t3_fq4ftg,1585341181.0,Who mentioned their so? I think we need a little more context here
mentalhealth,flomehj,t3_fq19ua,1585341116.0,"The bullying and the incident with the girl when you were young can definitely be traumatic. Honestly, no one can tell you what is considered traumatic because it is different for everyone. Something could happen to you and you could be okay with it, while someone else could experience the same and find it very traumatic. If it feels/felt traumatic to you, it was."
Psychosis,flo6uzo,t1_flo6gtg,1585332687.0," Thank you. My close family and closest friends are aware, though its not something I have really worked through yet. I would most likely want to talk about it with my therapist. I think I will try to bring it up the next time I talk to her. 

I was about to say that there is no way to prove that it happened, but I guess that if I really needed to know I could try and contact the hospital and ask them to confirm that they saw it happen. But either way, I experienced it and it is still just as triggering. Thank you for your offer though <3"
TalkTherapy,flo6eww,t3_fq0q1v,1585332453.0,It is definitely okay to walk into the ER if you are in a crisis.
Psychosis,flo4brb,t1_flo17jt,1585331366.0,"Thank you for the great answer. I really do want to talk about it because I think its important for my ptsd not to get worse, but I feel like if I tell anyone it will sound fake because I cant remember much, so why would I remember this? I feel like people will think it didnt actually happen, that I was just imagining it"
ptsd,flnyxxx,t1_flnuvtv,1585328518.0,Your therapist dont do video sessions?
AskPsychiatry,fll3wg6,t3_fpifv2,1585253143.0,"Dont stop your medication without talking to your doctor about it, I know its tempting but just dont. Theres a big possibility you’ll just feel worse than you are now, and this is especially bad when you cant talk to your therapist. 

Do you get enough sleep? 

I know this will sound stupid, but do you get fresh air? I know its hard when you are feeling depressed and on top of that there is a pandemic going on. Even just going out and standing outside for 5 minutes, fresh air is sooooo good for you."
ptsd,flhxz3z,t1_flhxuxr,1585171607.0,"This obviously isnt a long term solution though, sometimes I try to just power through it and tell myself that I am safe, I am okay, I am in my own home and I am doing something good by showering and taking care of my hygiene."
