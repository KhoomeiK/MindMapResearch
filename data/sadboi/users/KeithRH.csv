depression,fc2mk48,t1_fc2lucv,1577367176.0,I’m on so many medications to keep from ending it all that my life is just fake. I have no family and I live in fear of each day being worse than the one before. Deciding to live has more fear than deciding to die. I’m actually quiet comfortable with the idea. Thank you anyway

depression,f57xbos,t3_dn2e7h,1572044767.0,"I attempted it twice. For me it was the spur of the moment and I went. On both occasions I found the right spot and threw the rope over the branch. Alas on both occasions I was spotted. I’ve never had a plan, I just felt the time was right and so off I went. I know that one day it will take me and I’ve learnt to live with that fact."
