sex,fq8ggqp,t1_fq10lbp,1589165643.0,"Thank you for the advice. I do eat healthy, I just don't eat eat enough. Everything I do eat is measured and calorie counted though, and I always make sure I get a balanced diet. 

I'd be fine with adding muscle but not fat. I'm considering upping my calories, it's just quite a difficult decision when you've spent so long restricting."
sex,fpxfmit,t1_fpxcu86,1588981768.0,"I do take vitamins but maybe I am still not getting enough of certain things. Yeah i think the stress makes it harder and harder, need to find a way to calm myself down."
sex,fpxferx,t1_fpxejjz,1588981644.0,"So underweight men don't suffer from sexual problems as often? 

I eat healthily and exercise, but I restrict my calories so no I don't eat enough to gain weight. I will be seeing a doctor at some point hopefully."
sex,fpxd7tt,t1_fpxchrw,1588980380.0,"I have something like anorexia but I am currently not interested in gaining up to a ""healthy"" weight. I tried to recover before and it was horrible- I lost control of my eating and gained 10 pounds of fat in one month. I don't want to go through that again, i want to try and fix this with minimal weight gain if possible.

You are right though, my hormones are probably affected. Maybe there is a way to fix them."
sex,fpxan0f,t1_fpxa8xz,1588978910.0,Thanks I'll try posting there as well
EDAnonymous,fl26m78,t3_fm3ugd,1584744099.0,Fuck that bitch
EDAnonymous,fl26j88,t1_fl0usx2,1584744048.0,"Yeah no you're right, i know if i just eat at a deficit or at maintenance I'll be fine but it's difficult now and i wish i didn't want to eat"
EatingDisorders,ffdsq7m,t1_ffax2x2,1579827973.0,"Haha yes you're right. I want to become healthier, gain muscle, have more energy, but I don't want to eat more. When my friends or gf tell me to eat more it feels like they are mocking me somehow, i can't explain it. I still see myself as fat, even though I know I'm not actually."
EatingDisorders,ffdre1j,t1_ffax2ld,1579827068.0,"Yeah i converted to vegan halfway through my weight loss, to be honest it gave me a good excuse to turn down food and eat less. I wouldn't go back though, I'm glad I did it."
EatingDisorders,ffdqafe,t1_ffaswg4,1579826374.0,"Thank you :) i guess after seeing all these replies it seems like I may have an eating disorder. It's difficult though, I'm not sure what recovery will look like for me, or if I even need to. I eat 1800 calories a day right now, it seems to be all i can eat without gaining weight.

There is a lot of stigma attached, especially for an adult man, so maybe that's why I don't want the diagnosis. A nutritionist may be a good idea, you're right."
Fitness,feleqj2,t1_fekzgol,1579220442.0,Thank you. 2500 seems like a lot to me but I'll give it a go.
Fitness,fekyng2,t1_fekx7gk,1579210328.0,"Thank you for answering. I'm really confused by my TDEE. I just looked and apparently I need 2700 calories a day to maintain this weight with heavy exercise, yet I'm only eating 2000 and I'm not losing weight, I don't seem to be anyway. I measure them extremely carefully, if there's any doubt i don't eat it. I might try 2300 and hope for the best?"
Fitness,fekwg4c,t1_fekv6qo,1579209015.0,"I decided to recomp because I don't want to lose weight but I don't want to gain any fat, that's what's putting me off bulking right now. I lost 110 pounds and I am underweight if you go by bmi, but I don't really look it and I still have fat on my stomach. Scared of gaining more fat after losing so much.

I don't do the lifting right after cardio, I leave it a few hours. It can get tiring though. I am thinking about trying a small bulk, or would a cut be better to target the stomach fat?"
Fitness,fekul98,t3_ephdxd,1579207914.0,"Is 3 hours exercise daily a good amount? (2hrs cardio, mostly running, then 1hr of lifting)

I am eating at maintenance. I am quite fit, but i am trying to recomp as i still have excess stomach fat and I want to see my abs."
Fitness,fedzncu,t1_fedwuc0,1579023255.0,I just can't really tell. I'm sure I have some fat left. You can barely see my abs even after losing so much weight
Fitness,fedw673,t3_eojczi,1579021168.0,"I'm ""skinny fat"" but technically underweight bmi, after losing 110 pounds. I'm male. I'm not sure if my stomach is mostly loose skin or if it's fat, but either way I don't want to gain any more fat. 

I do a lot of cardio (running) and lift weights 4 days a week but my body doesn't seem to be recomposing like I thought it would. I'm eating at maintenance.

Should i be eating in a deficit to lose the last bits of stomach fat? Should i be gaining? I've come so far and now just feel stuck."
loseit,fednhz9,t3_eoj52n,1579015802.0,"I just don't eat anything if I don't know the calories. Overly cautious yes, but I would rather just not eat something than eat and worry about it later. Better to be under my calorie limit than over. If I absolutely have to eat at a restaurant, I will get a salad or something similar.

With eating at friends etc, I will just say  I ate earlier if anyone offers food."
loseit,fec3siw,t3_eod4j2,1578966235.0,"I had this too! The first time someone called me ""skinny"" I was so confused and didn't realise they were talking about me. I still can't really look at myself objectively, I hope you get there."
loseit,fe050ar,t3_enhnqy,1578803225.0,"Drink green tea/ chai/ coffee. All good appetite suppressants. When I was losing my last few pounds it did plateau, but I just increased my exercise and lowered the calories and eventually I lost them. I didn't eat much carbs, but if you do I would try brown bread instead, or even something like rye bread. They have less sugar and salt and are better for you in general."
progresspics,fdzhwud,t1_fdz69rr,1578790357.0,Thank you! Yeah a lot of people who knew me then can't even recognise me now. I wish i could show the face difference because that is crazy
progresspics,fdzfhfk,t1_fdyn1l9,1578789689.0,"Thank you. I don't know if I would call it an eating disorder but I definitely got a bit obsessed and put everything into my weight loss. It was all I really thought about and I was very strict with calories. But that's normal right?

I'm quite surprised by the reaction in this thread. I don't think i look underweight in that picture but that doesn't seem to be what everyone else is seeing. Maybe it is body dysmorphia."
progresspics,fdyd553,t1_fdybqwk,1578778475.0,"I'm alright thanks. I don't think I look too bad.. I know I'm technically underweight but I seem to still have excess fat on my stomach. Maybe it's just skin though. It was a lot of work getting here and i am very scared of gaining again, but I know I probably need to."
progresspics,fdy9h0r,t1_fdy7wtx,1578777432.0,It started off really quickly but got slower. I was on a very low calorie diet doing quite a lot of cardio.
