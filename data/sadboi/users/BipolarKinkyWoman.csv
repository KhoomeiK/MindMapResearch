Why did you go to a shelter with the kids? Was he attacking you or the kids? Was he verbally abusive? What was going on that you decided to leave for the night? That is pretty heavy stuff to do, I just want to understand the situation better.

People with bipolar can get better through a comprehensive and integral set of measures including pharmacological, cognitive and behavioural. The right meds in their right dosis for that particular patient, along with therapy, full night sleep, low stress, meditation or mindfulness or any system that allows the person to be in control of his head and not viceversa, nutritious diet low in sugars and carbs, high on veggies, fruits and protein; exercise, measures that help him in particular (for me contact with nature and sunlight are essential), etc etc etc... the person can really get better and go back to being healthy.

But that doesn't mean you need to stay with him. Don't worry about God, nobody knows what God wants or doesn't want, not even the pope, nobody knows if he likes or dislikes divorces - I bet he likes divorces when a person is being abused and is suffering and the divorce leads to a better life. God is your strength within you and whatever you find the ethical solution to be, God will support you. Think of God as being on your side, and understanding and supporting any decision you make. Don't pay attention to what those single men without experience in marriage tell you about what marriage should be, they don't know anything, they were never married in the first place. What do they know. God will understand whatever solution you need to implement and he will be there by your side if you believe in him (her?).

Good luck!"

bipolar,fjh6pwc,t3_fdfv1f,1583342305.0,"Hi.  The birth control pills do not teduce their efficacy with lamotr.  It’s the other way around.  The BC pills reduce the levels of lamotrigine in your blood.  I copy paste: 

Lamotrigine has been effectively used for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Many women suffering from bipolar disorder are of childbearing age; therefore an adequate contraception is a major concern that needs to be addressed in this population.

Special consideration should be taken when patients taking lamotrigine plan to use oral contraceptives (OCs).  Studies carried out in both healthy volunteers and patients with epilepsy indicate that OCs may alter the blood levels and efficacy of lamotrigine, decreasing its concentration by about 50 % (range 41%-64%) after just one week of co-administration. In addition, during the week of the inactive hormone preparation (“pill-free” week) of oral contraceptive therapy, blood lamotrigine levels rise and can double by the end of that week.

These studies showed that estrogen increases the clearance of lamotrigine by inducing the liver enzymes involved in its metabolism. More rapid metabolism results in lower, and possibly sub-therapeutic, levels of lamotrigine. Therefore, clinicians should consider increasing the dose of lamotrigine to compensate for the marked reduction in lamotrigine when a woman initiates treatment with an oral contraceptive.

In addition, there is a bidirectional interaction between OCs and lamotrigine, in which lamotrigine causes a small reduction (20%) in the blood concentration of progestin (levonorgestrel).  While other anticonvulsants may decrease the efficacy of oral contraceptives, lamotrigine has not been shown to affect the efficacy of oral contraceptives.  Nonetheless, women are advised to monitor for any changes in their menstrual cycles, such as breakthrough bleeding.

My point is: it's good to remind people with BP that meds are important and helpful, but don't demonize people who take another route, don't scare them saying they will commit suicide or end up in the hospital, because it's just not true. We are all different and I am not advocating for anyone to go without meds for 20 years as I did. But we don't need scare tactics based on false assumptions."

When there are no reasons left, when I really, really don't want to be in this world anymore, when I am absolutely ready to act on it... the one reason, the one rope tying me up to this world, is my mom.

She is now 73 years old, she has good health and the 3 of us have emigrated, so she visits us as much as she can.

We have an open relationship, but I only fuck other men when I a traveling. Otherwise I organize MFMs with my boyfriend and one of my special friends, or with a new guy from Fetlife.

Honestly, to me it is the best thing ever. And if it is due to bipolar, yes to bipolar! I wouldn't give up my high sex drive for anything. It gives me pleasure even if I am depressed, it activates my capacity to enjoy, it balances my brain chemicals when I am down, it gives me joy, and it has led me to wonderful experiences.

last year I was alone and fell sick, my bf was in a work trip, so I went onto Fetlife and I posted I needed someone to come feed me, bring . me food, bring me water, give me a massage, and not expect sex in return because I was sick. I got so many responses. The guy who came was a guy I had a one night stand 2 years before. He said: thank you for the opportunity to thank you properly for the best sex I've ever had. Then I met another guy who also had offered food who said he was a chef. He came several times to cook me dinner and is teaching me some dishes. I have so many stories like that, of nice encounters on Fetlife. It's supposed to be for BDSM but I have made more friends there (real friends, not virtual, but face to face friends) than in any other social media platform.

Sex has brought me only joy. I use condoms, visit my gyn regularly, feel great.

I say all this because our society is very conservative and in all manuals for bipolars they talk about ""sexual promiscuity"" which has a very negative connotation. I love sexual promiscuity and have no moral qualms about it. I am an ""ethical slut"" (as the book's name). Maybe you can see your sexuality under a different light than the one society imposes on us.

I hope you feel better soon, either way! You will find a way to manage your sexuality that is comforting and adequate for you! 

virtual hugs going your way!"
bipolar,fiyjn2n,t1_fixxj0c,1582840686.0,"maybe that's just who you are. You like sex a lot. I think it is abusive that he sends you to sexaholics anonymous. I wouldn't stand for that. Why doesn't he go to a doctor to see why he has such a low sex drive? I would DTMFA (see meaning on Dan Savage's column Savage Love, hehe). Good luck!"
bipolar,fiyj4pn,t3_fadm0y,1582840407.0,"You might want to adopt that cat. First you need to go to a vet clinic and they will scan him or her for free to see if he or she . has a chip and belongs to someone. If he/she doesn't, then you can adopt him and he/she will keep saving you. My cats have saved me infinite times. I literally have a bridge that I can see from the windows of my dining room (where I study) and from my den (where I read and knit) and a guy thrown himself from there a few years ago. He came on his bike, left the bike there and jumped. I always think of following his steps when I am in suicidal depression, but my cats are usually on my lap, around my feet, or on the table among the papers if I am studying, or playing with the ball of yarn if I am knitting, and I always think who will take care of these angels if I am not here? So I keep going..."

Wellbutrin sent me into a mixed episode in 4 days, with psychosis. But it seems to work well for other people. Good luck!"

bipolar,fiw4gjj,t3_ekhm32,1582774944.0,"I also think hyper sexuality is amazing.  I love group sex, especially MFMs.  I can fuck for so many hours and keep enjoying... I love my sex life!!!!"
bipolar,fiw461z,t1_fdxl6gd,1582774742.0,"I see you posted this 46 days ago, so I assume the episode is gone.  How are you feeling now?"
bipolar,fiw3y0q,t3_eove2f,1582774586.0,"Tha ks for the recommendation.  I will watch it!! I agree with you, we are all seconds away. It may happen to any of us. Or anybody, really, except if you inherited a large fortune."
bipolar,fiw3atc,t3_fa0gks,1582774145.0,"I am a female. I am not in a long distance relationship but the things my boyfriend does that help me and that don’t involve physical presence are:
- telling me a thousand times that he loves me and how much he loves me
- helping me notice any positives.  Today I texted him that I had rage and that I had to leave Office Depot so I wouldn’t mistreat the lady there and that I went to a joibt to eat something tasty to lift my spirits.  his answer was (let me copy paste)  “But you were mindful of where you were emotionally and actively searched for a way to reduce the anger. That's progress, yes?”
- telling me again he loves me so much and what a lucky guy he is to hve found me
- when I express concern that he has to put up with my moods, he doesn’t engage, he doesn’t tell me that he won’t get tired - he just states: “I see it differently.” If I ask for more explanation in how he sees it, he says things like “I just love that I can be here to support you if/when you need it”
- listening to me, showing interest in what my therapist said, what changes to the meds I discussed with my psychiatrist, etc.  

If I can think of additional things that he does and help me, I’ll come back and add."
bipolar,fiw2e95,t1_fivds6m,1582773526.0,"I like this idea.  “Well, I don’t think a contract will work, but if you buy me a car...” lol!"
bipolar,fiw277a,t3_fa27q4,1582773391.0,"I cheated on every single boyfriend and I cheated on my husband.  I finally accepted my hypersexuality as a part of me and now I am in an open relationship, so I cannot cheat even if I wanted to.  Lol! I found a solution and I am very happy with my boyfriend.  We met in a gang bang party and we’ve been dating for two and a half years. 

My advice would be: communication.  Yes, address his worries, talk to him.  Answer his questions.  Generate a conversation, explain how you feel, understand how he feels.  Find an agreement that works for you. 

Good luck"
bipolar,fiw1msf,t3_fa2m7z,1582773006.0,"If you are willibg to talk to him and tell him the truth, do you think there’s a chance to get an extra week to prepare?

Do you have a doctor you can call and get medical certification saying you are sick (which is true)?"
bipolar,fiw1gsd,t3_fa2q0n,1582772894.0,I would never to my current employer.  Human resources is known for being terrible.  I think I would pay a price if I told.
bipolar,fiw107b,t3_fa3mwg,1582772586.0,"Same here.  I forget everything.  My friend from when we were children tells me stories avout our childhood together and I listen as if she had lived those things with some other person, not me.  

The memory issues are affecting my work, as I have to deal with hundreds of other employees and it’s extremely difficult to remember their faces and names.  I have projects going on with different groups of people, I write everything down to follow up but I will have to secretly take pictures and include them on my notes! Lol.  When I run i to someone and they say “I am sending you the report,” “I know I owe you something,” or whatever comment, I am always left wondering who that person is and what project he or she is talking about.  

It’s really hard to live without memory."
bipolar,fiw08dh,t3_fa3r5x,1582772074.0,Can you describe how you feel? Why do you feel manic? Are you having hallucinations? What’s going on?
bipolar,fiw04nn,t3_fa3sy2,1582772006.0,"Yes.  A person can be a trigger. My harassing ex boss is a trigger for me.  And I still see him because I changed departments but within the same org. 

You can ask for a restraining order even if you have not gone to the authorities or reported her yet.  Look for help, maybe an NGO? 

I would definitely consider changing my name and moving to the other extreme of the country as far away from her as possible."
bipolar,fivzo3j,t3_fa45v9,1582771700.0,"Yes, it’s exhausting.  I understand you so well!! I hope it gets better soon!"
bipolar,fivzgqo,t3_f90t25,1582771564.0,"Thanks.  I tried decreasing but I end up smoking whatever amiunt, it didn’t work really. I am trying again as of today.  I made a pact with my psychiatrist to hold weed for a month to be able to see if it impacts in my mood.  He believes I will notice a difference.  It’s easier to think of it as a temporary hold for a month than a forever thing.  Maybe if I can see the difference I will adhere to staying off it? We will see.  As of now, boyfriend smoked and I didn’t, and I feel proud!"
bipolar,fiuj1pb,t1_fitxq83,1582742335.0,"Yes, it should but isn’t.  I don’t do any more cocaine or alcohol or adderal or so many things.  I even cut down coffee! I have done plebty of hard stuff like heroine.  But I was able to handle everything but weed.  I think I am addicted."
BipolarReddit,fiu8ef0,t3_f9tjeo,1582736894.0,"Not everyone processes grief by crying.  Accept yourself, including your reactions. You know you are a good person.  You know you loved your friend.  You know you are hurt he died.  Don’t punish yourself just because you are different and your mind is wired differently.  You are not suffering less than someone who cries.  It’s just differnet ways."
bipolar,fitsg87,t1_fipf3zn,1582728373.0,"I smoke pot and my ex and current psychiatrists kept/keep asking me to quit. It’s proven very difficult.   I think what it does to me is push me a bit down, never up.  It also kills my initiative and motivation badly.  But in the short term it calms my mind, so I keep using it.   I guess I have some level of addiction.  Did you quit completely? How do you feel now? I guess I am looking for additional reasons to quit hehe"
bipolar,fitrtjq,t1_fit3olx,1582727962.0,"Geee!! I am glad you got off of it! It sounds terrible! I am right now studying for an exam and it’s true that it is more difficult to learn.  I am also droggy and sleepy.  And I am only on 100 mg! Being on 300 mg might very well be like it was for you. I will have to see.  My psychiatrist told me if we cannot stabilize me in three minths with lamotr+ quetiapine, he will try lithium."
BipolarReddit,fisid36,t1_fioage5,1582685398.0,"If they can help you, please consider talking to them.  I hope you get the meds.  But please keep calm while you don’t.  I only started drugs at 47.  I lived decades a successful life without drugs.  Full of fun adventures.   Bipolarity cost me my beautiful marriage, it’s true.  But I wouldn’t change the life I have had."
bipolar,fisgp9r,t1_fis0mo4,1582684508.0,"Ohhhh my friend, I am originally from a developing country and lived there for many decades.  I emigrated later.  At least in my country there’s a lot of ignorance and even educated parents don’t want to follow doctors orders.  

I understand why you wouldn’t call child services or any state agent.  

Your best bet is your psychiatrist.  Maybe you want to consider telling him/ her.  

Update me!"
AskHR,fis05yg,t3_f8bgfz,1582674778.0,"I was diagnosed 3 years ago and no way in hell I am telling Human Resouces! Once you get the bipolar label, any bad interaction, discussion, argument or confrontation you might have at work will be automatically interpreted as being your fault, your responsibility.  Any person trying to harm you can invent whatever, and your label will make it more believable.  

When I had to get leave ordered by my psychiatrist, I still didn’t reveal I am bipolar.  They can think it’s burnout, stress or whatever the fuck they want to think. 

Today my mental health was in a very bad condition.  I texted my boss and said I had a cold.  Which is true, but I would have gone in if it weren’t for my mental instability.  I was fine during the weekend and on Monday I woke up fine but as soon as I arrived I was crying in my office, door closed.  

Disclosure: I was harassed by my previous boss for two years and still have PTSD, I transferred internally and have a new boss but still see the harasser, who was just adminished even though more than a dozen of us complained formally against his abuse of power and harassing.  So I feel revicitimized every time I enter the building.  I need to change jobs soon. 

I am so glad I never said anything of my bipolarity! If I had, when this harassing asshole did his thing, many would have assumed it was my fault.  When I reported him, doubts would have contaminated my complain because “she’s bipolar.”   

No.  Not in a thousand years.  I will keep this from my employer at ALL COSTS.  But I have a shitty employer.  Maybe in a different situation..."

Regarding hypersexuality, I have it always.  It’s not the bipolar , it’s me.  😊"
