I blocked a lot of it out though. sometimes when I concentrate really hard I can remember important details, and it feels like living a life that wasn't real. the best we can do for now is spread awareness."

UnresolvedMysteries,fqu8tfd,t1_fqu5g4o,1589654253.0,"wwasp was but a blueprint. just because a program isn't affiliated with that specific corporation, doesn't mean they don't employ the same abusive tactics. I don't wanna bash the mental health industry at all here, there are some residential treatment centers that do real good for some kids. I'm not saying it's broadly representative of treatment of the mentally ill in the US, I was sent to many residential facilities as a young adolescent, and I would only consider one of them to be truly abusive. I only wanna get the news about these places out there, because I was severely traumatized. here are some of what I experienced that is consistent with WWASP tactics: admittance without consent or due process/forced escorting in the middle of the night, fear and intimidation based control, physical restraints (often with as many as 4 staff on top of one child, painfully pressing on muscles, with little to no provocation), isolation/social ostracism used as punishment, denial of communication with parents (when it was allowed, strictly monitored on speakerphone), mail censorship, monitored communication between children, inadequate education/lack of qualified teachers, strip searches, unhealthy food, timed meals (7 mins breakfast, 11 mins lunch, 13 mins dinner), forced medication, staff would provoke children/threaten/get in space and then use emotional reactions as an excuse to restrain, therapy sessions were used against the child, staff were extremely untrained and it was a revolving door, repeated bed drills/line drills for hours as group punishment, and there have been at least 2 staff so far taken to court for sexual abuse of children there. this happened to me in 2016-2017. I have no disingenuous agenda, here. I'm just trying to get the word out. I'm sorry if I offended you. but do not be mistaken, there is still rampant abuse going on behind closed doors."

.... there are so many others. so many children have died. my old roommate killed herself at age 19 bc of the trauma. how dare you speak so flippantly of something you know nothing about."
UnresolvedMysteries,fqt08lx,t1_fqscnv5,1589625401.0,"don't even get me started on the TTI & WWASP programs in the US. and they use neighboring countries to house their programs by proxy. a multimillion dollar industry where parents can pay to have their children kidnapped and held in abusive for-profit ""residential treatment centers"" until they turn 18, and in some cases, after they turn 18. parents can have their kids kidnapped out their beds and handcuffed at 3am by hired ""transporters"" and taken anywhere in&out of the country for no reasons, such as struggling with mental illness, being gay, not being religious, smoking pot/experimenting with drugs, or just plain normal teenage rebellion. one of the places I was sent to, a boy was there bc he was caught masturbating. that place also cost $10,500 a month, out the parents pocket. read up on the abuse that goes on in these places, it will keep you up at night. and this is happening today, in thousands of programs all over the USA."
troubledteens,fpxwugr,t1_fpxw2qb,1588991213.0,"all of your gut instincts are correct. I'm very happy you only just found out about this hours ago and are seeing through their brainwashing tactics! my best advice to you is keep researching, and protect your son at all costs. especially if he is autistic, good lord... these programs see your son as nothing more than a dollar amount. I can promise you they will spend as little money as possible housing him and giving him proper care, that includes the staff they employ. there are no horsies. there is no garden, not even any fresh food. if he receives therapy in these places, the therapist will not have pure intentions, and will work against him to keep him there longer, as he is making them money. by sending children to these places, parents are paying for trauma. shits fucked. if you haven't been on the wwasp survivors website, that's a great resource"
troubledteens,fpxtumf,t3_gg2tol,1588989459.0,"hey - I just wanna say, please do everything you can to both educate your ex wife and keep your son out of these abusive treatment centers. no matter what your kid is doing, nothing a 13 year old is doing warrants inflicting life long trauma. you sound like you're on the right side of things here, I wish my dad had done more to help me when my mom sent me away. 13 is so young. please don't let her do this to him."
troubledteens,fpi5gcm,t1_fphqv06,1588634037.0,"something about those places really causes one to dissociate... so glad to hear you're doing well and were able to escape your parents!! can I ask how old you are? in some states once you turn 16/17 you have more rights, and could legally leave your parents without having to be emancipated. that's what I did when I turned 17 (I live in MI). but that's so wonderful you have your foster mom to protect you!! I'm very glad you're in therapy as well, processing all you've been through is going to be difficult once the years go by and the dissociation wears off... but yes, while it is horrible what we have been subjected to, there is a beautiful strength in our numbers, and I am grateful every day that this subreddit and similar websites exist (-: if you ever wanna talk privately, you can message me directly, I've only been out a few years, and just recently stumbled into this community, but it's incredible the sense of peace that comes with sharing our experiences and strength."
