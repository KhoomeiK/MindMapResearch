I started using Laneige lip mask and OMG healed. My mom and brother have the same lip issues and we’ve all tried every product on the market (lanolin, A&D diaper ointment, Burts Bees salve, Blistex, Carmex, Vaseline, Bite agave mask, Aquaphor, etc). NOTHING works as well as Laneige does. 

Apply it pretty thick and you’ll wake up with lips still shiny (like you just applied it), and your lips will be plumper and smooth. If I skip it even one night, the horrible peeling cycle starts all over. My little brother has psoriasis,doesn’t complain EVER and is Mr Tough Guy, but when he’s running low on Laneige, he texts me every few hours to make sure I place a Sephora order for him cuz he can’t live without it. I know I sound like I work for them or something, but I just know that my mom went 60 years with this lip problem and I went 25, and now we’re FREE.

mentalhacks,fqrrw74,t3_gkiwhp,1589590592.0,"Definitely talk to your doctor. When my depression is especially bad, I become very antisocial and I’m always on edge. I’m like a caged raccoon and anyone who pokes at the cage is gonna get snapped at! When I have my depression under control, the anger melts away and I’m much less jumpy. For me, sadness first manifests as anger. 

Definitely find a different birth control pill and tell your dr how it makes you feel. Hormonal bc isn’t for everyone and having your hormones out of whack reallllly throws off your emotional equilibrium, especially if you have PMDD. I go from perfectly happy to a tornado of anger and tears yelling that the sky is falling and then a few days later am back to happy me...and it’s all from hormones. 

Hope you feel better soon and know that what you’re experiencing is temporary. You WILL find a solution, whether it’s a different bc, antidepressants, or something else. 

Be honest with your family that you’re experiencing these feelings and don’t like how you’re behaving and that you’re seeking help. We’re in the middle of a pandemic and everyone handles that stress differently, so to also have your hormones out of whack is a lot for one person to handle. Your family is also probably pretty stressed and may not know what’s going on with you and may be worried. Help bring your family on board your care team and be honest. I used to get angry with my mom, snap, then feel guilty which made me more angry...when I talked to her about it, we worked out a plan for deescalating and I felt a lot less shame. The more i was able to talk about my feelings and emotions, the less overwhelming it felt. Doing it alone isn’t easy!!"

Everyone I know who has moved to that area has HATED it, even when they’re living in a fancy high rise. There is ZERO sense of community and it’s a total ghost town on the weekend.

I totally get your desire for a central location and transit options. While Rincon/Soma seems like it should be the best place for transit, getting around that area is actually a nightmare...the streets are completely gridlocked during morning rush hour and from 2pm-8pm and if there’s a Giants game, GOOD LUCK. My friend lived down there for a year and she would walk half a mile from her apartment in Rincon Hill just to get an Uber or catch a bus cuz the roads near her were at a constant stand still.

AskReddit,fqa7ju8,t3_ghmr3e,1589214213.0,"Asked both of my parents this when I turned 20 a decade ago. Here’s what they said:

“Wear sunscreen even when you think you don’t need to” 

“If a relationship makes you changes things you like about yourself, it’s probably not a good one.”

“Save your money. Even just putting away 10 cents a day is worth it. If you get Starbucks most days, put aside that $4 in your savings account on the days you don’t.”

“You can’t miss money you never ‘had.’ Find out the minimum amount of money you can live on. If you start making more than that, have that $100 or whatever the difference is automatically deposited into a savings account you don’t have regular access to. You’d be surprised how quickly it adds up and prevents you from falling for lifestyle creep.” 

“Saving for big purchases is good, but use a good portion of it to travel before you settle down.” 

“You can live anywhere or do any job for a year.”

Look up Michael Sealey on YouTube. Someone recommended him to me for insomnia and panic attacks and oh MAN does it work. 

He has these guided meditations/hypnosis videos that are a godsend. I’m someone who is very anti “woo woo” so I was very skeptical, but his voice is like auditory Ambien or Xanax. (I’ve tried both, and neither worked as well as these meditations do lol)

I listen to him before bed every night and was able to get off of sleep aids. I’ve had a lifetime of insomnia from pain and anxious spiraling, and that man’s boring voice has saved me in a way I can’t even put into words. It’s become a habit and hearing him is like this trigger that tells my brain to power down and float away from the pain. If I met Michael Sealey (whoever he is lol) in real life, I’d probably cry."
ChronicPain,fpx4rnm,t1_fpx0t8i,1588975642.0,"This massage stick saved my career when my Ankylosing spondylitis was undiagnosed and I had horribly tense muscles and myofacial pain. It honestly helped more than some massage because I was in control and could apply really intense pressure to very particular spots but ease up on the pressure in other areas. Getting someone else to do that with the level of accuracy I was seeking can be tricky. 

Also taking magnesium and vitamin D helped a lot. I do epsom salt baths (helps more than I ever expected...I was almost embarrassed at how I wrote off this suggestion as “Goop-like woo woo”). I also take Flexeril at night (muscle relaxer) and it helps more than any opioid I ever tried. I’m on other meds for my autoimmune disease, but for pain, Mobic, Flexeril, and indica cannabis gummies in really low doses are my saviors. 

When I’m in horrible pain, all I want to do is lay in bed. I got a heating pad and use it constantly when I’m laying down. That being said, laying down makes it worse in the long run. Even just super light stretching helps tremendously. You need to keep your circulation going and prevent more tension from building up. I look for “gentle yoga” videos on YouTube or “stretches for bedtime.” They’re super easy and are meant to release common tight spots in your body."
SmolBeanSnark,fpwfsta,t1_fpw16b7,1588962688.0,"Omg dying cuz this made me remember the time I was on spring break in Mexico and I went with my then bf’s frat (mistake #1). They apparently would choose one guy to get super drunk each day but not tell their dates. When it was my bf’s day, I was at the spa with some of the girls so I missed the part where they fed him tequila shots. We met up at like 2pm at the pool and he was gonzo. He hadn’t really eaten anything, so I ordered a bunch of quesadillas and stuff and while he was waiting sitting at the bar nursing a bottle of water, he proceeded to eat all the stuff on the garnish tray. Like pineapple slices and limes, WHOLE. 

Eventually he got real food and I put him up in our room to sleep it off while I had some words with his friends. When I got back to the room 20 min later, his body basically had expelled everything in every way possible. It was like a murder scene and he was laying in the shower crying.

But honey, NOooOooo! It’s not worth it! The skincare girls you’re trying to impress with all your fillers and Botox and Drunk Elephant products aren’t about tans anymore! 

Also, here’s what I learned about blue light: 

“One small, peer-reviewed study of the effects of blue light on the skin, published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology in 2010, found that exposing skin to the amount of blue light we get from the sun caused more pigment, redness, and swelling than when the same person's skin was exposed to comparable levels of UVA rays.” 😱🤯🤬

AskReddit,fp18x5h,t3_game7o,1588227820.0,"I’m American but had a subleaser roommate in college for a semester who was a grad student from a rural part of China. We lived in CA. When we first met her, it was morning and I was making toast for breakfast. She looked super confused by the loaf of bread and asked if it’s food. I was like...wait...you’ve never seen bread?! 

Turns out she had never heard of bread OR butter. I made her a slice and she teared up and said she felt American. She then ate almost exclusively toast for a week. Took her grocery shopping and showed her all the different types of bread and we had a little taste test. Sourdough was her favorite, so this San Franciscan was pleased! She made me some of her foods and I definitely stepped waaaay outside of my comfort zone and we had fun. Communicating was a little tough, but good food transcends all language barriers.

Edit: I’m sure plenty of people in China regularly have bread or know about it. All I can share is this one particular student’s experience. She was from a very rural village and had only been to a large city in China once, and it was just to catch her flight to the US. In terms of what she made for me, I’m generally a pretty picky eater, so when she would tell me the Chinese name for what she was making, I didn’t Google it. 99.9% of it was some kind of fish sauce and rice and veggies, and once some squid. It was decent, but a little rough to smell cooking at 6am after a night out 😂. 

We shared tv shows with each other by putting on subtitles for her to read while watching American shows (she thought Say Yes to the Dress was amazing and really liked Friends), and she would show us some pretty hilarious Chinese game shows. She was really shy with everyone but me (the rest of my roommates were pretty loud and I’m more introverted and took her under my wing), but made a lot of friends in her classes because there was a large contingency of Chinese students (either Chinese-Americans or other international students like her), so she hung out with them more than us as she got into her classes. She ended up dating another exchange student and we went to Forever 21 together to pick out date night outfits! She was a computer scientist, and omg she brought so many of our cheap laptops back from the dead lol. 

She was the KINDEST, most considerate roommate I’ve ever had and it was truly a wonderful cultural exchange. It’s a great reminder of the importance of these programs, especially for young people. I’ve seen horrible vilification of Chinese people during this pandemic and while it’s clear the CCP is not good, the people of China are humans just like the rest of us! 

(And about the bread, we were in the Bay Area, so this wasn’t like in the middle of nowhere with only Wonder Bread or sugary wheat at a Kroger’s. We went to Italian bakeries to get focaccia, pita from the Persian restaurant down the road, all kinds of sourdough (including a sourdough heart loaf from Boudin for Valentine’s Day), yes Wonder bread cuz she admitted the packaging was familiar (she agreed it was gross!), some super healthy breads from Whole Foods, etc. She also really liked Challah bread and I made her French toast with it!)"
AskWomen,fp0bdfb,t1_foyw2nd,1588206014.0,"Ok I live in SF and it’s really concentrated to just a few streets downtown in the Tenderloin and SOMA. Unfortunately that’s right by all the hotels, so tourists think that’s SF. It’s reallllly not. It’s like judging all of Chicago as “run down and dangerous” by driving thru a portion of the south side. Yes those areas exist and all west coast states have a homeless problem due to our mild weather, but that doesn’t define the SF experience by any stretch of the imagination. I’ve seen human feces a few times, but for living here for 8 years and working downtown, it’s only been like 3 times total and in places I would expect to see it. 

And ya, you might see some naked bodies cuz nudity is legal in SF. 🤷‍♀️"

femalefashionadvice,for38we,t1_fopm3hq,1588005419.0,"Also went to college for a year in Western MA (I transferred back home to CA cuz what the hell was i thinking with that weather?!). I had never lived anywhere with snow and had zero clue what I was doing. Can confirm that layering is ESSENTIAL and not just in the warm months. I had to hike up and down a hill to get to class (always included falling and sliding half the way on ice). I’ve never experienced a more intense temperature swing than going from being a popsicle walking to class to instantly melting into a puddle of sweat when I walked into a building. It was awful. For class I stopped wearing sweaters and went for athletic fabric long sleeve shirts with an open cardigan or something over it. That way I could strip down to breathable thin clothing when the sweat attack would happen every time I walked inside and not look like an idiot in an undershirt lugging around 20 lbs of North Face gear (that happened a few times)

My biggest tips were to get thin long underwear to wear under jeans (or at least something more substantial than a thong) cuz my actual butt would go numb within seconds of leaving my dorm. I had a huge long north face jacket and I think I would’ve been better off with two less intense jackets layered (i looked like I was wearing a sleeping bag). Then when I’d get to the library or a hall where I’d have more than 45 min of class, I’d go in the bathroom and take off my leggings under my jeans. 

Bean boots are worth it, but I also loved my Sorel Joan of Arctic boots cuz they were much warmer. And consider getting those clip on spikes for extra traction on especially icy days. I also really like Cole Haan Zero Grand boots. They’re water proof, warm, SUPER lightweight, and pretty stylish for what they are. I wore them all over Europe in the winter 2 years ago and swore by them. 

The biggest shock for me was that I literally wore 3 pairs of shoes for 8 months (uggs for around the dorm, Sorels for anything outside, and black boots with a bit of a chunky heel for dressing up/going out). I grew up in the Bay Area and wore a uniform in high school, so shoes were my way of expressing myself. Cute flats work for like 8 days a year. It’s either hot and sticky (so you want flip flops) or frozen tundra of slush. 

Pack some warm weather clothes cuz everyone will bust them out the first time it breaks 50 degrees. Never did I think 50 degrees (California winter) would be tanning weather, but after 5-6 months of it never topping 25 degrees, 50 is bikini weather. 

Something I wish I was told before moving and experiencing culture shock: it’s ok if you don’t recognize everyone’s style or if you have ZERO desire to wear their style! I was in New England in 2008 and I’d never heard of Longchamp (I called it “that champ brand” and was shocked to learn those small plastic-y bags with a leather handle could cost $150), and I thought much of New England style was horribly boring and unflattering (despite being super preppy). I was mocked endlessly for wearing big sunglasses in winter (apparently sunglasses are a summer thing only?! So stupid), was shamed for not knowing you can’t wear black jeans to a country club (country clubs in CA are basically golf and tennis clubs for old people, not WASPy racist places with a “no denim” dress code for a burger at a bar), etc. The people there reallllly turned me off with their judgment, which led me to not take their advice on other wardrobe changes that I would’ve benefitted from. A lot of this is probably no longer true thanks to how much we know about fashion from different regions thanks to the internet, but it’s advice I wish I’d heard then."
AskSF,foqz8hu,t1_fopfhyy,1588003416.0,"This is a great answer. I grew up in suburbia (East Bay) and thought I’d want to live in the city cuz it’s more exciting. Been in SF for 8 years and while I love it, I’m learning I probably am better suited for a rural/suburbia that’s close to a city. Plan a lot of day trips to give her a break from the concrete jungle: beaches, hikes or horseback riding up in Sonoma or down in Pescadero or Santa Cruz, etc. The great thing about the Bay Area is that we’re not defined by one lifestyle. I have native friends who grew up in a very urban lifestyle and others who grew up on dairy farms. Encourage your gf to be open to new experiences  and remember that nothing is permanent. And when moving here, choose one of the more quiet neighborhoods...it doesn’t sound like Nob Hill or SOMA would be a good fit. Maybe try the Presidio or the Sunset? I lived in Presidio Heights for a few years and it truly felt like suburbia."

femalefashionadvice,fokfang,t1_fokbdh0,1587840999.0,"I second Athleta! I have very fair skin and have watched my parents, aunts and uncles get melanoma or end up with giant craters in their skin from basal cell removal. I refuse to go down the same path! I also have lightweight scarves that I wear around my neck when I’m going to be outside and bending over and don’t want sun on my neck. (I got mine from REI)

I wear some Athleta UPF shirts, but also have Lands End sun shirts that I wear when I swim. For example, when I’m in Hawaii I wear my cute bikini with a cover up in the shade (and full body SPF), but when we go into the ocean or the pool, I slip on my long sleeve SPF shirt. At first I got looks, but now it’s become increasingly common to see other women wearing them, as millennials start caring about skincare more. If I ever get embarrassed, all I have to do is look to the old ladies by the pool with dark leathery skin and I feel confident again. I had a bf say, “You look so great in your bikini...why are you hiding your body?!” And I said, “Cuz my skin is built for Ireland, not Mexico and covering up is the only way this body stays alive in the long term.” 

I’ve also seen a huge rise in long sleeve swim suits that are SUPER cute. CoverSwim is expensive, but great for inspiration. 

I’ve also just resolved not to be outside in direct sun during the height of the day. If I want to go on a hike or a run, I go early morning or at 6pm. I’ve also discovered a lot of...creative hat and cover ups on Amazon that women in Asia wear (since they’re obsessed with pale skin). I actually ordered this sun shield thing that kinda looks like the plastic face shields nurses in the ER wear. This summer will be the first time that we all collectively put our health ahead of our fashion (with face masks), and I’m just fully embracing this mindset and applying it to sun protection."
