Psychosis,evqki6m,t3_ckoy2p,1564693709.0,"Thank you for posting this. This is exactly what I needed to see. I've experienced 3 psychotic breaks and by the time the 3rd one happened, I was 'experienced' enough to understand it was psychosis, and I navigated it as I would a semi-guided LSD/mushroom trip and relished in all the profound spiritual beautiful things and synchronicities being exposed to me.

I was recently reading Michael Pollan's book ""How To Change Your Mind,"" about the history and his personal experiences with psychedelics, and it says outright repeatedly that *psychedelics mimic psychosis*. And even in our culture, *psychedelics are given so much more respect* (**albeit understandably**\--people *willingly* take psychedelics, unlike an uninvited psychotic break that can last months). But the fact that people constantly talk about and are given space in major publications about their spiritual experiences while on psychedelics, but meanwhile people that have experienced psychosis are stigmatized, shows some type of huge major disconnect.

For me, the synchronicities while in my psychotic states were major enough to make me believe there is something greater, and psychosis lifted the veil of reality into another realm--*just a peek* into something else that most people cannot see.

After my first psychotic break, I would have told you that you were ""insane"" for suggesting psychosis had anything to do with 'the nature of reality' and 'pointing toward something greater,' but after navigating my 3rd psychotic break very knowingly, and being self aware of what was happening, I was able to navigate it to my advantage and experience more the spiritual awakening elements.

I want to add that some people with psychosis don't experience the spiritual awakening aspects, they only hear voices or have frightening visual hallucinations, so they might attack your claim that psychosis/schizophrenia points toward anything greater, because their experiences are disabling and/or frightening."

Psychosis,eutdqp9,t1_eus8jos,1564024162.0,"I get psychotic due to stimulants like Adderall or even Lexapro. This is new for me, onset at early 30s. I spent my teens and 20s partying freely (cocaine etc mixed with daily Lexapro) without any issues.

Then I took Vyvanse (similar to Adderall) for 6 months to perform better at work...and started getting paranoid...and slowly a psychotic break hit me. It was due to many factors I personally contribute to competitive urban living but Vyvanse put me over the edge into psychosis.

I thought it was a rare isolated incident and recovered after a while. After about 2 years I was green lighted to take Lexapro again for my anxiety. For some reason, maybe hypomania or just lack of fear thanks to Lexapro, I increased the Lexapro dose behind my doctor’s back. This caused another psychotic break. Took me a long time to heal. The psychotic break lasted months (that in of itself is a long story).

After the 2nd psychotic break I healed and after about 2-3 years I felt cocky and wanted something to curb my social anxiety, so I started on Lexapro again. After only a week on Lexapro on the LOWEST dose, I had my 3rd psychotic break. 

I suppose 3rd time’s a charm and now I know never to take Lexapro or stimulants ever again. My 3rd psychosis lasted about a month because that’s how long the antipsychotics took to kick in.

For me, psychosis was life ruinous. It took my 6 figure salary jobs and took me out of the game of life for too long. Psychosis felt like a psychedelic trip and that I’m grateful for, but psychosis lasts too long and took me out of the game of life.

I’m now forever wary of any drugs (legal or illegal) that come with psychosis triggers. That stuff is real and while I’m grateful my psychosis made me less materialistic (due to the psychedelic-like spiritual experience), I’m not happy how it took me off track in what should have been my prime."
