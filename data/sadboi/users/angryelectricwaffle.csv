depression,fdyocas,t3_en29p3,1578781910.0,"I wouldn't call it fantasizing. It's more involuntary and much more disturbing for me. My brain makes the plans without me thinking about them. They pop unbidden into my eyes. As I walk passed a knife, as I'm in the garage and see the beams overhead, when I pass that welding supply place that sells gasses. I have seen myself dead in so many places. Sometimes I'm not even feeling depressive. They come as flashes. I only broke down and attempted once. Luckily my survival brain kicked in and called for help.
Now they're always there, when I drive over a bridge, climb up a ladder, hold something sharp.
They're just kinda a background loop that sometimes gets a little too loud."
depression,fdylwz0,t3_en2qbu,1578781242.0,"I understand. I feel like I'm done. There's just really nothing for me here. But I keep pushing. I keep looking for the light around the bend. It's hard a lot of times and I just want to stay in bed. You can do it. It can be better. I have caught that ray of sunshine on my face occasionally. It was so warm, so clean feeling. You can do it. I might not be able to believe in myself right now but I can believe in you."
depression,fcxvd4u,t3_ejamne,1578071014.0,I usually put on sad music when I feel like this. Then I cry for as long as I need to. Then I put on something else. Silly I know but it works when I need it to
depression,fc5l0cj,t1_fc5c5bb,1577460420.0,"I understand your and other comments thoughts. What good is life if you're your just surviving.
 What's good is getting another opportunity to try. Getting another day to see if anything changes. They'll be long stretches that feel like torture, until you notice, yes somethings changed. You need to put in the work though. I have suffered with depression for near 45 years. I wake up everyday ready to fight to survive. Not just to survive but to effing live. 
I know sometimes it feels like you're just surviving and what's the point. I get that. But you can't give that up. Get up to prove the world wrong. Get up to prove yourself wrong. You're not worthless, you're not a fraud. Do it everyday. Everyday try to learn. Become those things you want. Don't let the monkeys in your head that throw poop around mess up you trying to become more.
I promise, if gets better. It never goes away but it gets better."
depression,fbr6rf6,t3_ee58qm,1577039830.0,"I'm 45 my mother has told lies about me my entire life. Her latest are that she hired a private investigator to find me and that I'm living in a homeless camp in the woods. Which is not true, I live with my wife and kids in a house less then 15 miles from her. What I guess I'm saying is that you can escape it, you can move on from her. You have to be strong just to prove them wrong, then you can do what I did and just walk away from them and never talk to them again if you don't want to. I used that thought  when I was younger too just make it through the days. 
Be strong. We are all stronger then we might think, and while this moment hurts you can do it. I did. I'm still here and I'm thriving. You might not feel it but you got this."
depression,fb48jgc,t3_ebbhhi,1576503908.0,"Me too. I think that way about my wife and kids too. The key for me is to think of all these random intruding thoughts as monkeys throwing poop around my brain. Then I just laugh at them and say silly monkeys.
 Seriously though, there's not a single person you know who really finds you to be a burden, and if they do they're not real friends anyway. The best thing you can do is talk. When I was younger I used to sit and just watch my friends interact because I had no idea how to do it. I was lucky that I found skateboarding, the friends I made there didn't care if I sat and just watched them interact. It gave me a leg up on how to act ""normal"" and also how to not care about acting ""normal"". It taught me when I needed to act normal and when it was ok to be an emotional mess."
future_fight,fb2pm8f,t1_fb1vg05,1576455366.0,Same happened to me. I was second and picked Cap but boy did we loose. Wolvie lead kept trying to steal the canisters I was trying to get. Lost soooo bad.
BipolarReddit,fb2p85u,t3_eb4wox,1576455158.0,Yup. I love showering but hate showering. I know how much it will help my mood too. To be clean and fresh but I just can't pull myself up off my chair or out of my bed to do it.
depression,fattv4f,t3_ea9h8q,1576341547.0,"I personally wear a happy mask all the time. Very few people outside of my immediate family know I suffer with bipolar. Only when I start getting manic and over the top with grandiose ideas and plans do people start thinking something is wrong with me.
My depression I hide so no one sees it. I don't want them to know. I would rather make them laugh and smile because I know what sadness feels like. I don't want them to worry or be sad over me."
depression,fanw6w6,t3_ea1i6c,1576251999.0,Good job!
depression,f9vol0b,t3_e754hd,1575675625.0,Some times we get caught in a cycle of crying. Let it happen. You can do this. You are a lot stronger then you think you are. Trust me I've been here. I know how you feel. If you have a safe person to talk to go to them. Reach out. If you have no safe place tell us all here why you're crying. Even if it's just to say you don't know. I think All of the people on this sub are willing to listen. Willing to cry with you. Willing to at least be here for you because we know what you're going through.
depression,f9vo37j,t3_e73q7r,1575675264.0,Yeah pretty much every time. That is if I can sleep at all. Just keep opening those eyes and you'll be OK. You can do it. I swear.
depression,f9vnznj,t3_e6zxhr,1575675191.0,"You can be happy. I've suffered with depression for over 45 years. We tend to focus on the depression . On our misery. When you notice the feeling coming on again try to think of something that makes you happy. I often feel like I don't deserve or belong with my wife and kids. They don't need me, they don't want me. Then I'll remember the time at the aquarium or something and it helps a little.
Letting it out to someone helps too, let them know your starting to go under and you just need help. All of this, even though it feels like it's forever, is temporary. It all passes. Talking to a professional, someone you feel safe with etc. Just talk it out. Keep typing it on here in reddit. It helps."
depression,f9try5t,t3_dsgdf3,1575637430.0,"I do. Except the school part. I'm way old so it's go to work for me. Sometimes it's a struggle to look at my wife and kids and not feel like an outsider, to feel like I belong here. I fight everyday for my life. My advice and how I basically lasted this long (45 long years suffering) is to know that no matter how many times your mind tells you that you are worthless, you have worth. It might feel like a lie you tell yourself in the beginning, but you begin to know it's true. The more you fight through the feeling, the stronger you can become.  I did attempt suicide at a very weak point. It's dumb and not worth it.
Talk to people, let it out. Tell them you're struggling. Tell someone what's going on in your mind. Seek professional help. Don't push people away because you think they don't want to hear about it. They would rather sit with you while you cry for days then sit at a funeral for a few hours.
And come to places like reddit and let it out. I'm sure everyone on this sub will want to listen /read and will do their best to help you through. Sometimes, for me, just knowing that others struggle with this and make it is enough to get me through a rough patch."

NewSkaters,ewmsh1r,t3_cp228z,1565559410.0,You've got it man. Work on the speed of that spin. Concentrate on keeping the board directly under that front foot. Start doing them rolling slowly. It really does help keep the board under your feet. It'll also start to get you used to landing on it rolling.
NewSkaters,ewms8sl,t3_cp11d0,1565559249.0,Concentrate on that back foot.like the other guy said snap that hard and quick. You should kinda be jumping already when the tail hits the ground.
