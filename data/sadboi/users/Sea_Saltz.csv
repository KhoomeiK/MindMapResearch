MLPLounge,fnbtczq,t3_g0s6sw,1586821934.0,"I value the episode solely on the relationship-build between Rarity and Applejack. I feel it not only shows Rarity‚Äôs care for her friend‚Äôs time, relaxation, and rest, but it also greatly adds to the overall chemistry between these two characters up to this point. Applejack‚Äôs acceptance of spending time with Rarity also shows the bonding and bonding-rituals these characters can have as well. In addition, it shows Applejack‚Äôs aspects of duty and responsibility she feels towards her farm and family business. Of course, it‚Äôs not necessary as we‚Äôve already seen this demonstration of commitment in episodes such as ‚ÄúApplebuck Season,‚Äù ‚ÄúBats!,‚Äù and so many more! (It also accurately represents Rarity and the gang‚Äôs likewise care for Applejack‚Äôs responsibilities)

I can somewhat understand and see the criticism of this episode stemming from AJ‚Äôs strive to fix and perfect everything in solving the problems around Ponyville Spa; however, I see it in a different scope, in that, these actions enhance the character and give the audience a different side to Applejack we haven‚Äôt had enough of. The idea of AJ wanting to go about solving a problem by attacking the root of it, rather than letting a problem fan out and continue really fits her character. To put it in another way, I see AJ as the ‚Äúif it ain‚Äôt broke...‚Äù-‚Äúthink smarter, not harder‚Äù kind-of character, if that makes sense!

Now, I don‚Äôt feel the episode is exactly perfect, in that, Applejacks hypocrisy of tending to her responsibilities in a rather abnormal, silly way conflicts of how she helped solve the water pressure issue at the spa earlier in the episode. On the other hand, AJ perhaps handles her responsibilities in her own way rather than how someone else would. Remember, we‚Äôre talking about the same pony who wanted to buck all her apple trees on the farm by herself! Indeed, it‚Äôs weird seeing this issue of consistency of AJ‚Äôs character. I get that. However, just remember that this is a children‚Äôs show ALMOST-primarily structured around building a theme and teaching life lessons. The theme of this episode works actually well, in that, peer-review and togetherness can be a helpful tool in tackling situations large and small. Rant over!

Edit: also, any excuse to see Applejack do the chicken dance, I‚Äôll take!"

Yeah, she‚Äôs funny, and, yeah - she addressed it in the lyric in the song of ‚ÄúFame and Misfortune:‚Äù ‚ÄúPonies think I‚Äôm all bubbles and laughter, that I don‚Äôt seem sincere...I might joke around a little too much, but I‚Äôm just so happy you‚Äôre here.‚Äù But, I feel that this doesn‚Äôt necessarily excuse the times of Pinkie not taking a situation seriously. Now, I realize that Pinkie has always been there to save Equestria with her friends - by the by. I totes understand that. However, she treats these situations where lives are possibly at stake as somewhat of a Rollercoaster. Some may see this as a great exercise of her element - fair. But the amount of times we see Pinkie have a deep concern for situations and her friends are few and far between to me. In MLP: The Movie, we see Pinkie call out Twilight, a very emotional scene - one that I really enjoy and would like to see more of. But, my point still stands about this character. I also realize many, many people adore this character. That‚Äôs fine! I like her, too! She‚Äôs just my *least favorite.*"
