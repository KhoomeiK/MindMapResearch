This has been a very challenging and isolating thing for me and I have been dreaming to one day be able to drive again.

Now I think I'm ready to try again. I'm planning to take many driving lessons, as many as it takes to get comfortable with it. I want to do this and I need to do this (trying to tell myself I can do this).

My one advice is that keep at it. When you get the licence, just drive and drive and drive. It will build up your skills and confidence. You can do it! :)"

Good luck to all of us! <3"

I haven't really talked about this to anyone, I keep a brave face in front of friends and family. 

I have to give myself time to grief and the new dreams will come later. I know I will get through this and be stronger, but it will take some time. And I needed someone to tell me that today, I needed to know that I will be ok.

It might sound strange that I'm talking about these feelings 1,5 years after the break-up, but first year went dealing with what happened right after the break up (he destroyed things that were very important to me and almost took his own life). I have now stepped in to a new phase of the process and I've also had otherwise rough time this year. 

I have done online dating before him and also after. Only casual dating now though, I have to process my own mind before jumping into anything serious. Now I'm off Tinder, it's a stressful world, the dating world. I will go back after I feel stronger."
