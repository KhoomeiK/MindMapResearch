the ideal payment network must allow every single human on the planet to conduct an average of X transactions in a day, now take how many people in the world around 8 billion, let's say the average person does 16 transactions per day... so 8 billion \* 16 is 152 billion let's say every transaction takes one kilobyte so 152 billion kilobytes to simplify that's 152 terabytes per day...  note that facebook 2 billion active users generate 4  petabytes of junk data  [https://kinsta.com/blog/facebook-statistics/](https://kinsta.com/blog/facebook-statistics/) .
