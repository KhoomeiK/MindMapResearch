I do believe we are capable with the resources we have to get a pretty solid idea of what way be going on with our bodies without consulting a doctor but this of course depends on what. Like, ""numbness and tingling"" as a symptom can mean so many different things ranging from slight to full on paralysis. That's why it's hard to self diagnose when symptoms can be easily misinterpreted."

Most acne products have SA so whatever you can get your hands on without breaking the bank should be effective. Exfoliation helps too. I use exfoliating gloves in the shower and give these particular areas extra love.

I mean, people equate what is perceived as healthy changes as taking charge of one's life for the better which not everyone is able to do. You go from being pathetic to respectable and the shift in confidence shows. But also, this is so far from the truth for us, lol. Seeing how differently I get treated makes me lose respect for people, at this point in the game. You deserve to take up space and belong here just as much as anyone else. My confidence is now heavily based on knowing how to do so regardless of how I look or feel about how I look or feel as a person really. It came with age though.

EatingDisorders,fou1bvp,t3_g9jhg2,1588073299.0,"It's entirely based on what works for you and how disordered your thoughts are. Which can mean a lot of trial and error. For me, eating one meal a day has helped, but while some folks can do this with a healthy mindset, I still can't. All this does is help keep those habits at bay. Which, at it's root seems to be based around having structure. I don't recommend this if you're not in a good place mentally with food. I do say this however because it can sometimes be better to eat on a schedule rather than to eat when hungry (for EDs). I guess that's why meal plans work but I've never been able to follow one or crate one for myself personally. If you can though, it is most ideal when dealing with these thoughts and habits."
