I just got diagnosed with vertigo in November, got referred to an ENT yesterday. Average wait time for ENT in London, Ontario is over 200 days.   I don't know if I'll even get a good ENT. So if my visit in over 200 days from now goes wrong, I have to wait again to see a different one.  There are a lot of people who go to Michigan to get CTs and MRIs and see specialists if they can afford to because of how bad the system is. It may be ""free"" but that comes with its own cost.

It is also really hard to find a family doctor in Ontario right now.  Let alone one who is willing to help with chronic pain and problems. It took me 2 years to find a good dr.

I wish you the best of luck. Maybe check online to see if there are family drs accepting patients in the area in Canada you want to move to and fill out an application and fax/email it in? If you decide to move. Also, ask if they have a wait list and put your name down if possible.

This way if you get scared the dr can just read his copy and you dont have to worry about talking and remembering. Being a pen and write down his answers to your questions. Also if u dont like the dr find another one. Don't try to get along with a dr that doesn't feel right to you.
