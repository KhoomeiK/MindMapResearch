Shale oil is not sustainable due to the fact that they need to constantly be drilling to make money. They need to replace approximately 70% of their wells (going off memory sorry) per year while we only need to do around 12%. In simple terms shale oil is short term profits but the company is based on debt, it's not sustainable and no amount of public money can prop up a failing business"

We have boilers, heat exchangers and valves that are manufactured across Canada, we are at the cutting edge in creating new technology for energy and have safety standards that are the best in the world without question, all of that will move over into a green energy industry if we let it.
