paloaltonetworks,foh5gm3,t1_foh4zbj,1587760752.0,"Call it paranoia, but the cloudflare pod is to encrypt all my dns traffic.  normal DNS is unencrypted, so you could sniff  what websites im going to.  DOH (DNS over HTTPS) is like a vpn for dns traffic, all dns queries leaving my network are encrypted, only on the receiving end are they decryped.  I trust cloudflare (and to some extent google) over my ISP.   I'm a devops engineer by trade, so this stuff is all stuff I use in my job.  I'd be happy to share my kubernetes files with you if that would help!

You could just have bind forward to [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) (I would also recommend you specify at least one backup, like [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) incase), you just would lose the load balancing aspect like you said.   K8s can let you spin up a daemonset, which is just multiple copies, that then get LB'd by a single IP inside K8s, so traffic gets split across multiple instances

Bind is very light weight, you could easily run bind, cloudflaredns and pihole all one a raspberry pi.  I actually was on a 3B for the longest time because I didn't have time to integrate into kubernetes at the time.  It ran just fine, but the problem was since everything shared 1 IP, I had to ge creative (PIhole on :53, bind on 5353, and cloudflaredns on 15353.... then just  add the ports to forwarder options instead of default 53.    This way clients would hit pihole on standard 53, pihole would forward to bind on 5353, which would then forward to cloudflare on 15353, encrypting the final dns request to the internet.   Moving to K8s allowed me to go back and use standard :53 across the board, as if all services were running on their own machines... it just made configs cleaner that way."
paloaltonetworks,foh2a41,t1_foh0wo5,1587759712.0,"I have a kubernetes cluster (1 e5-v4 system, 2 raspberry pi-4's) in a small rack in my garage.  the PA-3020 uses BGP to handle routing to the kuberentes cluster ([192.168.50.0/24](https://192.168.50.0/24)) services. Inside kubernetes, I run the following:

piholebind9 + webmincloudflaredns DOH pod (using google + cloudflare DOH servers

my setup goes:PA3020 uses the pihole server as it's DNS server for all subnets so they hit pihole first.  Pihole uses the bind9 server as it's upstream, which contains all my internal DNS entries (edited using webmin).  Bind9 then forwards to cloudflaredns pod, which ultimately roundrobins between googles DOH server and Cloudflares DOH server.  I have two Cloudflare pods running to load balance requests.

the benefit of this is that first, all devices get pihole adblocking on my network automatically as their front line dns.  This only blocks ads, all actual dns queries are handled by the Bind pod.  If its not an internal DNS entry it goes to the cloudflare pod which then goes and resolves to the internet.

I can probably draw you up a quick diagram if that would help?   The benefit of doing it this was is that it's like running each service in a VM, each one has it's own IP, nothing is shared on the same server.   You could potentially do it on one host using docker, but you'd have to get creative using ports.  This way I have it like this:

pihole: [192.168.50.29](https://192.168.50.29)  
bind: [192.168.50.30](https://192.168.50.30)  
cloudflare: [192.168.50.31](https://192.168.50.31)

easy to remember.  29 just happened to be the first free IP in the subnet after additional pods I had running, so I stuck with that.  Since I'm using public docker images, this was the easiest option.  If I rolled my own image I could potentially roll most of it up into one container, but this was a very easy implementation."

DataHoarder,fmwk163,t1_fmwiht3,1586447967.0,"You can't even Saturate 10Gbps (1.25 GBps max).  So it doesn't really matter, since let's say you set it for 10seconds, that would give you 12.5 GB of data In10 seconds, but then you have to wait for that to flush at 0.75GBps.  you'd constantly be flushing to disk, and even if you set something really high, you'd always play catch-up at the risk of losing data.  If you're on 1Gbps that's a different story.  But again having. A 4TB write cache is just rediculous, and if you posted that on the freenas forums you'd be laughed off of them.   Size your Zil for your workload and bandwidth.  Oh btw, zil is only used for asynchronous writes, so if you're using VMware or something, you aren't gonna use the zip anyway."
DataHoarder,fmwie7k,t1_fmwfaru,1586447133.0,"""vfs.zfs.txg.timeout"" Is the tunable you want.  Default is 5 seconds, if you change to 120 seconds, you'll store 120 seconds @ interface speed, so 10Gbps x 120 seconds is 135 GB zil.  The problem is that you then have to flush that to disk, which could make things laggy if your storage is slow.  A safe bet is to figure out what your storage sequential write speed is, then work backwards.   My 18 drive array can  can comfortably write 2-4GBps sequential, so 10 seconds @10Gbps is 10GB of cache, but I usually do bursty writes anyway (dumping memory cards from my camera for example) so I don't notice any issues.  The default 5 seconds at 10Gbps is 5GB of cache,   little too low.

Trying to fill 4TB of cache on anything less than a 1+ Tbps network is just asking to lose all your data. I looked at unraid for my house to store my media and images on, but I've used freeenas since the early days... Zfs is  huge selling point."
DataHoarder,fmwdruh,t1_fmvvn5g,1586444740.0,"And you'd be wrong.  By default, the TXG flush is 5 seconds.

Not to mention, having a 4TB write cache is just stupid.  Read cache?  Fine, that's what your ARC/L2ARC is for, but why the hell would anyone need a 4 TB write cache?  You writing the exact same file 5000000000000 times in a row?"

kubernetes,f69al8m,t1_f65lm6l,1572739315.0,"Well Shit.  Now we're on to something.  I just tried from my cell phone on my wireless subnet, [192.168.2.0/24](https://192.168.2.0/24), and it works ([http://192.168.50.1](http://192.168.50.1)) gives me my nginx test page.

That confirms (I think) that BGP is setup correctly, I wonder if there's some routing issue then on [192.168.1.0/24](https://192.168.1.0/24),. Did you ever figure out why it happens on same subnet?  Could it be Asymmetric routing?  Since traffic from [192.168.1.0/24](https://192.168.1.0/24) goes to [192.168.1.0/24](https://192.168.1.0/24) via the same subnet, but then the router advertises the [192.168.50.0/23](https://192.168.50.0/23) subnet via BGP...so traffic doesn't come back through the router?"

Install KubeRouter

  sudo KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf kubectl apply -f [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/master/daemonset/kubeadm-kuberouter-all-features.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/master/daemonset/kubeadm-kuberouter-all-features.yaml)

Delete kube proxy

sudo KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf kubectl -n kube-system delete ds kube-proxy1

starcitizen,f5zsgoz,t1_f5zs3ew,1572585740.0,"I'll see if I can get more info for you.  The devops team I've been apart of for the last 3 years has become heavily fragmented, so we no longer all work on the same stuff (we're split across 3 floors of a building).  the details I can give you though, are this:

&#x200B;

If you're familiar with puppet, it uses something called facts, which is information about hosts.  We use something similar but an in-house developed tool  We can group systems by various catageories that inherit categories above them... for example, I can have a host in Virgina group (lets say Eastcoast group), then that server can be part of a group called mysql, which is then a part of a group called masters, etc.  This mysql group then inherits a bunch of alerts (mysql up, database size, replication status, etc)   These all nest under each other, but can also inherit other groups.  

Anyway, what is now our automation team put together a tool that then goes through every hour or so and checks out a git project that contains all these groupings.  Because we have SO many systems, and because they all have so many alerts, we were killing our systems trying to build the alert manager rules so often, so they backed the timing off to something like once every 12 hours.  It's not very distributed, there are tools like Thanos that let Prometheus scale horizontally,  but we're basically rolling every system up into a small handful of prometheus instances, so this can take hours to generate all the configs for alert manager.  Once it does, it reloads alert manager with the new rules."
starcitizen,f5ysjnu,t1_f5xqr8l,1572561052.0,3 minutes?  That's cute.  I remove one host from an alert policy and wait 12 hours for Prometheus and Alertmanager to finally show the change due to automation that goes and scrapes tons of files to build it's rules.  Not my doing.
PleX,f3vuykr,t1_f3vum40,1571185425.0,"it's great if you never want to worry if something is running :)   if sonarr/radarr/etc dies, it automatically gets restarted, or moved to a different node automatically.  Everything has a health check, and i expose these things externally using an nginx load balancer.  It has a somewhat high learning curve to start but you could probably pick it up in a few days.   I work in DevOps so these are all things I use daily.  Overkill for most home use sure, but not if you're into tinkering with new stuff.   I also run an enterprise firewall (Palo Alto networks PA-3020)..overkill, but at least i dont have problems doing things at gigabit speeds :)"
PleX,f3vujjx,t1_f3vu8mh,1571185147.0,"kubernetes is an orchestration tool.   I've got 2 nodes of a supermicro chassis running it, along with a number of services, sonarr, radarr, librenms, gitlab, prometheus, mysql, etc.   Basically It's like VMware/hyperv, just free...and lighter weight.   The only problem is I'm constantly rebooting one or the other for updates, etc, and since I don't have a true HA (High availability) set up, some things go down for a bit, like plex, and people complain lol.   I'm using ISCSI storage for plex's data folder since it's so massive (260GB currently), it was too slow over NFS.   I'm moving plex off the kubernetes system to a dedicated server so that when i reboot the other things, plex isn't affected, keeping uptime up so people don't complain :) .

I also sat down with one of the guys on my network team last night and confirmed this with him, basically the way I think this would work would be to advertise the VIPs on both nodes via OSPF or BGP, then implement a source NAT on the firewall to prevent asynchronous routing issues.   Thanks everyone!  Going to try implementing this this weekend"

If I were using OSPF, I'd assume something like:

Area0: [192.168.1.0/24](https://192.168.1.0/24)  


but then I get confused for the other parts...would Area 1 be [192.168.1.25](https://192.168.1.25) \- [192.168.1.27](https://192.168.1.27)  \+ 10.32.0.0/12?"
