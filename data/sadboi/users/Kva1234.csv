Honestly, I'm glad my mom hit me with the chancla because I learned from my mistakes and grew up to be a good person.

memes,foq2ps2,t1_foq2g26,1587980831.0,"Why? Me paying for water should help improve the system, and make sure we have clean water. Government owned companies don't do that. Water is a limited resource, and if not taken care properly we can lose it. Governments have proven that they can't take care of companies, so why should they?"
memes,foq2lyi,t1_foq267e,1587980719.0,"Yeah people have money to get drunk every weekend but cry because their water bill will increase. Argentina was not doing good in the 1990s when they privatized their water system, and it is still private to this day. Being a developing country back then, I think it has worked good for them."
memes,foq2bz0,t1_foq1i7l,1587980423.0,"There aren't resources cited for that article. Just arguments. Some of the arguments mention the increase in costs, reduction of the workforce, and an increase in maintenance costs. Allow me to ask, what company in the world doesn't do these same things? If I don't buy a filter, I can't drink water from the faucet because it's not drinkable. A whole water filter system can cost from $200 to $1000.  I wouldn't mind if my bill increases $185 per year if my water will come clean. English people can drink water from the faucet because the companies running the water system make sure that the water is clean. Privatizing water sets a standard of quality, one that we don't have in develiping countries. Also, the government (at least my government) is unable to provide maintenance for all of the water system. It would cost too much."
memes,foq1pp1,t1_foq1hz6,1587979779.0,"I already do pay for that, it doesn't matter if it's the government running it now  if you don't pay, they cut the service. That's why I mentioned that they would be under government supervision. The price we pay is actually high compared to the minimum wage here."
memes,foq0e76,t3_g8vhb1,1587978410.0,"Honestly I would agree with privatizing water. In my country people waste too much water, and they steal it by breaking the counters. Also, the government company doesn't make sure everyone has water. So I would agree with a company managing the water system, and improving its effectiveness whilst being supervised by the government. In addition, I would make wasting water a crime and people would have to spend time in jail for wasting water or stealing it. Otherwise, they don't care for it.


Edit:

Examples of countries with private water systems: 

England 
Argentina 
France
