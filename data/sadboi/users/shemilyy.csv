This stuff honestly hit me better than a UP Wedding Cake batch, this flower was no where near as harsh!

MOMpics,fg86yfg,t1_fg7x1kp,1580611159.0,"Yeah I get that. In 2016 here in the NT that was standard street price for ditch weed so I really don‚Äôt mind paying for this good stuff!

My personal rating of this flower is:
Bud structure: 9/10( she sticky af)
Taste: 8.5/10 
Potency: 9/10 
Nose: 9/10 
Burn: 8/10

I‚Äôm actually pretty impressed, as this was my first time burning flower from this grower, and I have to say, it hit harder than expected. I felt this one in my eyes, after ONE bong rip (I usually take 3+) and TWO bong rips got me ripped outta my mind! I really like this flower, and wish i got more LOL"
