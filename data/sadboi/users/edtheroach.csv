TalkTherapy,fr4ursx,t1_fr4git4,1589897271.0,Well said!
adultsurvivors,fqwlyr4,t3_gl2b14,1589709376.0,Dave Pelzer who wrote A Child Called It and countless other books about resilience and strength to pull through.  I am reading his book Help Yourself currently.
depression,fqwl1oi,t3_gl8he5,1589708372.0,"The show ""Being Erica"" is about this very thing...time travel therapy.  She learns a lot of relatable lessons.  It was one of my comfort shows during depression."
therapy,fqwjmry,t3_gl824o,1589706860.0,"Thanks for starting this thread.  I am in school for clinical Mental Health Counseling and I also want to make sure I do right by clients.  The biggest teacher for me has been participation in my own therapy. I've had four therapists, two male and two female.  I had great luck with the males and not so great with the females...what does that say about me?  Haha. 

One of the female therapists got frustrated with me because I didn't want to keep trying meditation and mindfulness.  She said she didn't know what else to do for me.  If she had done some guided ones with me it might have helped but she just wanted me to try on my own.  She was nice but I guess not versatile.  

The second female was online and though she was very knowledgeable about trauma, she was unprofessional.  She always had a tank top on and sat in bed while her dogs barked in the background.  I just wanted a tad more professionalism.  Also, she stood me up twice and messaged me much later about a family emergency and then another time about having to stay late at work for a crisis.  I am very understanding but I feel like she could have let me know around the time of my appt.  It takes a lot of effort to be ready for a therapy appt.  It's anxiety inducing at times.

The first male therapist is my fav.  Saw him in my 20s and again in my 30s.  He's a family systems therapist and definitely person centered.  He uses a whiteboard and does a lot of psychoeducation showing you the patterns and roles that you play in family and relationships.  He was very attentive and checked in with me during my crisis moments.  He would let me do 90 minute sessions since I only saw him twice a month and he knew his rate was out of my price range.  I wish he had tried to process my romantic transference feelings with me.  I brought it up, said I knew what it was about and we moved on.  I ended up feeling like I couldn't be honest with him without processing through it so I ended the therapy.

My current T is the second male.  He's also a family systems therapist.  What I love about him is that he challenges me and he doesn't come across as overly compassionate.  I always wanted a therapist who I felt would be honest with me and not just try and make me feel better.  He also listens to my input.  When I told him I want therapy to more goal oriented rather than 'flavor of the week' he told me to email him my goals and he brought them up immediately the next session.  Therapy is going slower than I'd like but I also brought a lot of things to address and I wouldn't be surprised if he's almost as confused as I am about what the hell has been going on in my brain, lol.  My former therapist said I could come back and I want to really badly but this new therapist is more affordable and I want to see where I can go with his more blunt style.  I do tease him for asking so many broad questions!  Lol."
TalkTherapy,fqq6b9c,t1_fqnxl58,1589560138.0,That's a sucky situation to be in all around.  But you are right about the investment in your future.  I am getting my masters in counseling and also paying out of pocket for a therapist.  I call therapy sessions the most expensive class in college because I can learn far more from a practicing therapist then a professor
askatherapist,fqq4a83,t1_fqpprip,1589559146.0,"Therapists are non judgemental and remind us to stop comparing ourselves to others.  Just because you can't remember the abuse doesn't mean it wasn't traumatic.  Also, the fact that your half brother makes you uncomfortable now is something to bring up in therapy.  With most therapists doing telehealth now, it is a bit easier to make time.  I wish you the best."
TalkTherapy,fqnvwxx,t1_fqmnmze,1589502456.0,Have you looked into free therapy from universities?  Low cost at community centers?  Also many therapists have sliding scales based on client income
TalkTherapy,fqlu78w,t3_gjeaoy,1589466150.0,"1 session a month?  Is it the typical 50 min session?  It would take so long to work on solutions at such a slow pace, imo.  Have you thought about bi-weekly?"

counselling,fpus4sk,t3_gfgogg,1588921862.0,"I just think so much communication is lost via text.  I imagine she might not feel that text therapy is as beneficial for you.  If you go through a platform like Betterhelp, those therapists are used to the texting format.  Can you try talking to her on the phone while walking or in a car or backyard?"

rape,fpcjtl3,t3_gchcpy,1588503217.0,"Same, thanks for posting this.  I was molested as a kid but it was pretty mild...still around the time puberty hit at 14, I started having fantasies that were violent or out of my control.  By college, full on rape/murder fantasies which made me feel guilty.  Then I also got drunk at a party and lost my virginity to a couple who apparently had planned to sleep with me when I was intoxicated.  That was 11 years ago and I still feel ashamed about the rape fantasies but I know that logically, it's not my fault and it's not what I wanted.  Sometimes I think the fantasies are a way of me acting out the way I felt when molested but totally in control of how it happens.  It's something I've been seeing more people post about so it's good to know we aren't alone."
askatherapist,fpcj5ql,t1_fp229vj,1588502501.0,"You are right that they may not be affordable for some.  I should have said they are usually cheaper than in person, private psychotherapists.  I did read all the comments, or I wouldn't have had anything to respond to.  Yes, I do have issues that I need to deal with but they have nothing to do with what I expressed here.  Thank you for the well wishes (even if it was sarcastic).  I genuinely hope the best for you too."
therapy,fp213bw,t1_fp10e05,1588252889.0,"Nah, they don't feel that way.  That's your insecurity/critical voice telling you that.  :("
askatherapist,fp20yci,t1_fp20btt,1588252799.0,I don't know what yt is but I'm telling you from personal experience they are real therapists.  They are also affordable.  You were saying you needed help badly yet it seems like you knock all these suggestions.
askatherapist,fp207s3,t1_fo03qa6,1588252319.0,"Untrue.  I don't know where you are getting your info from but I can confidently say as a former client of a therapist on that site, they are true licensed professionals."
askatherapist,fp204nc,t1_fo0qds9,1588252261.0,I agree.  I saw a licensed social worker on that site for my state.  They are licensed professional counselors and social workers.  I'm not sure why OP is knocking them.
therapy,fozbup0,t3_gaf3n8,1588188047.0,Yes it does lol.  Sometimes I will ask my T what the question was and he even has a hard time remembering!  I hope that means he's just comfortable riding the random train with me.
stopdrinking,fozbamu,t3_ga5zs8,1588187784.0,"I can't seem to go more than 6 days sober so to me, 59 days is not small potatoes.  I'm in recovery groups and they are helpful but ultimately, it's just me and my anxiety running the show.  Ironically, I work on a detox unit at a psych hospital.  People seem to get good help there, especially with detox.  It's a little scary doing that with the corona virus being a threat, but your drinking may be more threatening than that, so maybe look into a detox program?"
psychotherapy,foz8pmp,t1_foz6d1a,1588186548.0,"Good suggestion, thanks"
TalkTherapy,foz6xe8,t1_foz6s6t,1588185701.0,You could type out the email and bring it for him to read in session.  I've done that before.
TalkTherapy,foz6s6t,t3_g6qvw6,1588185632.0,"It worries me that you are terminating therapy in the middle of what sounds like a severe depressive episode.  Do you have plans to start seeing another?  With the ruptured trust it can make you feel like you don't want to continue therapy with anyone.  Plus starting over sucks.  Maybe you just need a break from therapy for a little bit?  This is just so sad.  Maybe he is scared to admit that the convo took place before hand because of liability issues.  Maybe he has his own defense mechanism of faulty memory because otherwise he might beat himself up and feel responsible.  After all, he's human too.  It sounds like he's very open to discussing all this in therapy.  I agree that the email thing was poorly timed especially since he let you do it in the past but consider this...now that you've shown the ability to act on your SIs he could be worried that you will send an email when actively suicidal and he won't see it in time.  He'd prefer you to contact a crisis service.  Most therapists likely don't even look at emails during off work hours in order to separate their work from home life.  I hope things improve for you."
TalkTherapy,foz5pvj,t1_foynays,1588185126.0,These are great suggestions!
TalkTherapy,foz5ig8,t1_foyq5gv,1588185028.0,"My GP is my prescriber for antidepressants and he can also prescribe anti-anxiety meds (though he won't for me because of my drinking issues).  I think my therapist would prefer I see a psychiatrist because he always asks me, ""is it a psychiatrist you're seeing?"". But in our city there are only about 30 psychiatrists and they have long waiting lists.  I really like my GP so since it's working for me for now, no reason to change.  I hope you like the psychiatrist."
TalkTherapy,foz4szn,t1_foyscjc,1588184691.0,I'm in an LPC track program and the LCSW take a lot of the same classes as us.  I've also seen two LCSWs as a client and they were good therapists.
TalkTherapy,foz3hg9,t1_foy7y2n,1588184053.0,Moodpath has good ones too and it's a complex mood tracker with a very detailed report every two weeks you can share with your therapist.
TalkTherapy,foz352q,t1_foy3uqs,1588183887.0,Agreed!  I fought meds for months...kept getting on them in desperation then getting off when I felt better because I hated the idea of being on them.  Did this three times before I learned my lesson 😂. SSRIs can be so beneficial.
TalkTherapy,foz2u9g,t1_foy59wo,1588183737.0,"I agree.  I have a great therapist but even he prefers to see me when the medication is in my system for at least a week.  I appreciate this because honestly, I'd probably be wasting money if I talk to him when I have no idea how to help myself...when I'm in a state of not being able to take in suggestions, etc.  Therapy is most helpful when you are in a state of self reflection and have some energy to put in the hard work of self improvement.  I haven't found it very helpful for crisis control other than the therapist just sitting with you and being empathetic."
psychotherapy,foz2a6l,t3_ga9o0g,1588183458.0,Thank you for asking this question.  The comments here are very helpful.
psychotherapy,foz24hu,t1_foyoxsb,1588183377.0,I don't see any current downvotes on your comment but I get frustrated too because my comments get removed all the time.  I'm a counseling student who goes to therapy so sometimes I share my experience in therapy if it's relevant (how my own therapist handled a situation) and it gets removed because it's a client perspective.  I think that's some BS lol

OCD,fnyc397,t3_g4cebi,1587358793.0,I'm definitely a drama magnet but I try really hard not to be (and I don't gossip about people...I see no thrill in that).  But this feeling of being a drama queen and being told this by friends over the years makes it hard to reach out and ask for help.  I also put myself down before they can.
depression,fnyalxh,t1_fnxlivw,1587357631.0,I am so sorry for the loss of your mother.  Everytime my meds are discontinued or started is when I feel the most suicidal.  It's really hard to feel that way day after day.

SuicideWatch,fnukneq,t3_g3sz2y,1587264377.0,Please talk to a therapist.  I'm so sorry for what you've been through.
adultsurvivors,fnukgh5,t3_g3y0xa,1587264245.0,"Wow this is so horrible.  Whenever someone is dealing with memories and the effects of sexual abuse, I tell them to see a therapist...but in your case it would be so hard to trust one and even seeing one might be retraumatizing.  Have you ever been to another therapist?  Do you know if your former was ever caught?  I can't imagine how many people he did this to."
TalkTherapy,fnueeh9,t3_g3q7v7,1587260214.0,"I can relate to your post so much.  I have a newish therapist (seen him for about six sessions) so I was very hesitant to bring SI up even though it was on my mind constantly.  I also had a very complicated plan that is now nearly impossible to enact due to the restrictions of businesses (my plan getting materials from three different kinds of stores) but I had to ask myself - other than the obvious - wanting the method to be relatively painless and wanting it to not be messy so as not to be as traumatic for my loved ones...why did I choose such a complicated plan?  Probably because I really don't want to die.  I just want the pain to stop.  Then, a few weeks ago, there was a very easy method that was sitting right in front of me and instead of doing it, I drank to try and stop thinking about it.  Developed a little bit of a drinking problem as it was daily 3 to 5 shots.  It was a way to avoid the thoughts and sleep through the day.  Once I felt like I was past the worst of it, I let my therapist know about the method that was available to me and that it had since been locked up (though I don't think I told him about the more complicated method).  He hasn't freaked out - just asked me to talk more about the particular thoughts I have related to the SI."

He hesitated but said yes, he thought I was a good person.  I feel bad about it now."
TalkTherapy,fnpzt6n,t1_fnprsdu,1587155008.0,The ACA code of ethics is what we follow in Texas...I think its what all US therapists follow.  I don't think hugging is mentioned.  It's a really interesting read and can help you understand why your therapist may be avoidant in some areas.  I think all clients should read the code of ethics so everyone has a good understanding of the limits of the theraputic relationship.  (Not a therapist...a N00b counseling student)

I also completely relate on a couple of levels - I also have a hard time calling an experience when I was drunk rape and I also reached out to the person and apologized for blowing it all out of proportion.  It has been 11 years and I still go back and forth on this.  I am glad that you are sharing your story with the world and I'd be very interested in reading your published piece.  Please send it to me, if you remember.  I understand not wanting to hurt him and also being scared of being gaslighted by him.  The thing is, you can't control his reaction and other people's reactions.  You did something brave by sharing your story and I hope that no one is able to make you feel bad for that."

TalkTherapy,fneqils,t3_g1bbo0,1586894050.0,"Haha, absolutely love your title.  It made me laugh.  I think showing that vulnerability in therapy is great.  I have a hard time doing that myself in person or online.  I recently cried in an online session and it was the first time I've cried in front of him for the six weeks we've been working together.  It was a cathartic moment and it showed him what area is the hardest for me to talk about."
UTSA,fneo2zf,t1_fnenflg,1586892808.0,Well schizophrenia is treatable.  Just because you have a mental illness doesn't mean being productive is over.  Did your mom or brother get treatment?  Have they found success in their lives?  Counseling can definitely help and medication can too.  Have you been to counseling before?
askatherapist,fnenmc2,t1_fnen23e,1586892573.0,"That makes sense certainly - using operant conditioning.  I understand the reasoning but I guess I relate it to my thoughts when I'm depressed.  If I pinched or punished myself everytime I had a suicidal thought (similar in that they are thoughts I do not want to have) then I just think it would make the internal shame of having these thoughts stronger.  It's also the whole pink elephant in the room...when you try not to think about something, it becomes stronger and more intrusive.  If you are associating something negative to a thought you already feel negatively about, I think that would make the problem worse.  But of course, I could be very wrong.  I hope OP finds a therapist who can help through methods like CBT."
depression,fnemnlw,t3_g0z8r2,1586892086.0,"Hey so I came to your profile because of your post on UTSA (I'm a grad student there) and I noticed that people were giving you a really hard time about the negativity on your post.  All your negativity sounds like just giving a voice to the depression thoughts that may be assaulting you daily.  UTSA is clearly not the forum to get support.  I see you're a gamer, so am I.  Not as hard core, more casual but I really love video games, table top games, and RPGs.  Also a friend of mine is an associate producer on the two most recent Doom games - since you like Doom, I hope that gives me some cred ;). Anyway, I'm sure you've already considered it but why not get into coding and computer science at UTSA?  You have issues with driving games being left in the dust...why not contribute to a resurgence of these games?  Coding is actually pretty fun (although complicated of course) but if you take it step by step, you might really end up enjoying it.  I also have a lot of friends who work in IT and networking for Rackspace.  They absolutely love their jobs.  That could be a cool place to work when you graduate.  My friend who is the associate producer on Doom started out in Quality Assurance when be was doing undergrad at UTSA.  It's basically video game testing.  Several years later, he's a producer!  I mean, the potential for growth in that field is massive.  I hope you find something to look forward to soon.  I know depression is awful and soul sucking."

rapecounseling,fneis0r,t3_g143ks,1586890114.0,So your University isn't offering counseling services online?  That seems really irresponsible of them.  My University is not only offering counseling services online but also the support groups are online.  We have a survivor support group which is so helpful.  Maybe you could find a support group to join while you wait for therapy to start back up again?  I'm sure there are several online you could find.

I am also do glad you took this first brave step in asking for help.  You're going to be ok, OP.  Just keep working on it with a therapist and support groups are AMAZING.  I attend a support group for survivors of sexual trauma and a recovery support group for addictions.  It's some of the best help I've gotten although I still believe someone should be in individual therapy simultaneously.  I know that no one can tell you to be easier on yourself, only you can convince yourself of that but I really hope that you do start to heal and show yourself some compassion.  I know you shouldn't trust internet strangers but I'm going to throw this out there anyway.  I'm a counseling student...in my first semester of my masters program (so by no means an expert in any of this) but I have wanted to work with people who suffer from pedophilia since high school.  I've always been a fighter for the underdog.  I don't think it's right that this mental illness is not treated with the same care and support of all others.  If you ever want to talk, you can message me.  Just know I'm a good listener but I am not a therapist."

If he can explore his life at this age with a therapist, he might find something there that he hasn't realized is affecting him.  He might not but it is certainly more helpful then punishing himself."

It's awful that society/friends made you feel like it was your fault that this happened because you drank.  I know that feeling all too well.  Even when people do know it's rape, many of them (the majority) do not report it.  Unfortunately, our society still needs a lot of improvement on helping rape victims rather than re-traumatizing them.  The thing you can do - start healing yourself.  A good therapist can guide the process.  It's hard but important work."
psychologystudents,fnbyzda,t3_g0eb3y,1586825150.0,"1.) I consider myself to have 2 jobs - I'm a Masters student in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and I work overnight in a psychiatric hospital as a Mental Health Worker/Tech. 2.) As a Mental Health Tech overnight, my #1 priority is to make sure all the patients are safe.  I do room checks with a flashlight multiple times an hour, I respond to medical or other needs throughout the night, I help process patient intakes and do inventory and safety checks, I file paperwork from the previous shifts and make new paperwork for the new day, I make sure the patients are stocked on towels, toiletries, and that their spaces are clean.  3.) When I was 11, I found a book in my middle school library on child abuse.  I read about counselors and that they help kids who have experienced abuse.  I decided that was the job I wanted to do and it has continued to be my life goal 23 years later.  I used to want to work with kids but now I want to work with a specific adult population.  I decided to apply to be a mental health tech while going to graduate school so I could gain some experience in psychiatric care and hopefully have an internship in this hospital when I'm further along in my program. 4.) The best part of the job is seeing people improve.  People come in distraught and feel like their world has ended but through the care of the staff, therapists, doctors, and other patients, and through their healing work as patients, they start to believe in themselves again.  I wish many of them could stay longer but unfortunately their stays are limited by insurance companies. 5.) The toughest part of my job is seeing people come back because sometimes the help and positive patterns you make for yourself in a hospital are hard to maintain in the real world.  I just wish our society was kinder to those who struggle with mental illness and substance abuse.  I wish they had as much support at home as they have in the hospital.  6.) We have multiple units and each unit has a female and male wing.  It's kind of a triangle shape.  The campus is large and not unlike a college campus. 7.) Our night supervisors are laid back and great people to work for.  They have all done the same job (and some still pick up shifts) so you don't get the feeling that they look down on you.  My coworkers are generally laid back and fun to work with.  You develop a strange sense of humor working in a psychiatric hospital and having that peer support of your coworkers is essential to job satisfaction. 8.) I have a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and several years of experience working in children and teen shelters doing similar work.  For my position, a year of similar work experience is required or enrollment in a Masters counseling program or an RN program.  9.) My #1 value is empathy - I don't think you can nor should work in mental health without empathy.  I have compassion towards everyone, even people who have committed the most heinous crimes because I see everyone as a human being and influenced by multiple factors in life.  No one is a monster.  You really need to be a people person to work in this field and you certainly do need to be a good listener.  10.) To be a mental health tech, you may just need to get that year of experience in a similar position.  Some of those positions prefer people with Bachelors degrees or LVNs and RNs but not all.  Advice for getting into a Masters in Counseling program - don't blow off your undergrad studies and be honest on your admissions essays - admit your faults, do not try to sound like you are the bees knees all the time.  11.) I am very passionate about the mental health field.  I really do like my job but the empathy burnout is a real thing - I do have a hard time seeing people come back and wondering how to help them. 12.) An average day is clocking in and getting to the unit on time because the other staff can't leave until you relieve them.  Getting a shift report from the staff, starting the rounds (the night checks), checking in with the RN to see what needs to be done first, doing all the equipment/temperature logs, refilling supplies, filing paperwork, creating new paperwork, and getting snacks other requests from the patients that are having a hard time sleeping."

SuicideWatch,fn9m794,t1_fn9kzgt,1586778153.0,"Here's her paragraph titled ""Edginess"". ""Characters with mental illness are edgy as hell - like, what is their deal?  They're often mysterious, or troubled, or mysteriously troubling.  There are two types of edgy TV character: (1) has a dark aura about them and dresses as such, and (2) is kooky and ""unique"" in a Willy Wonka-esque way.  There's no such thing as a humdrum mentally ill character; no one wants to see someone sleep till noon, get up, eat tuna from a can, and go back to sleep.  But if anyone does want to see that on screen I can send you my avails.  No one will believe mental illness is manageable and/or widespread if you only show two types of attitudes, looks, or illnesses.  Also, this tired ""edginess"" just makes you look super corny"" (Rosenberg, pg. 118)."

rapecounseling,fn9jf5o,t3_g0fl5v,1586775302.0,Find a therapist and start the healing process.  Confronting your brother at a later date might be part of the process and it might not.  The important thing is to discover all the repressed thoughts and emotions behind this.  I wish you luck and so sorry you are living with this trigger every day.

CPTSD,fn9imrs,t3_g0d8mi,1586774448.0,I had a weird realization recently but it was more an internal thing than externally caused.  I was 11 and a man exposed his privates to my friends and I while we were playing volleyball on our street.  I remember thinking it wasn't a big deal and not understanding why one of my friends was apparently traumatised and cried for days after.  I just realized a few days ago that my reaction was probably the weird one because by then I had already been molested so seeing a penis was no big deal.

AnxietyDepression,fn9i3rs,t3_g04cjt,1586773872.0,Dunno about Zoloft but I've been on Wellbutrin for about a month 150mg and I'm not noticing a lift in mood.  I did notice it with Trintellix but that med was far too expensive.  I do notice a decreased appetite so I just think of it as a great diet pill.
rape,fn9hh2e,t3_g06uze,1586773179.0,"Psychiatrists are expensive but there are many options for low cost therapy.  Universities offer free to low cost so their graduate students can gain practicum hours.  Some social services will offer free to low cost therapy for those in need (especially for victims of sexual abuse and violence).  Then there's finding a therapist through your insurance.  There's also a lot of online therapy options like Betterhelp.  It sounds like you already have a good amount of insight into your situation.  Your reaction to trauma is normal.  I had rape fantasies after puberty hit and I had been molested at age 10.  I blamed myself a lot for this and sometimes I still do.  Through therapy I have come to understand it's a way to gain control because we are the ones controlling the fantasy.  If you were to put yourself in risky situations, you would also be exerting your control over the next time someone takes advantage of you.  Overcoming sexual abuse is a hard road but a meaningful one.  I hope you find help soon."

SuicideWatch,fn8c763,t3_fzu0jt,1586738409.0,"So glad to read your edit that you're going to look for more help.  According to Time magazine, there are only about 3000 therapists in the US who see convicted sex offenders.  I think these numbers are abysmal.  If we want to work on preventing these crimes, we need to help those people who are at the source.  That's why I've chosen people who suffer from pedophilia as my population when I graduate with my Masters in Counseling.  I was a victim of a pedophile and I have forgiven him, plus I have empathy for the fact that he didn't have access to help when he was a boy.  Not that it gives them an excuse but most pedophiles have been victims themselves.  They still know right from wrong so they can choose not to victimize but I'm sure it's difficult - just like me not drinking during hard times is difficult.  Here's the thing, according to what you wrote here, you haven't committed any crimes - you haven't looked up illegal pics and you haven't actually hurt a child.  Those are some really strong positives.  You clearly have empathy - that's the best quality I think a person can have.  Based on what you said about your OCD, it is hard for me to believe you are actually a pedophile because a lot of people with OCD have these torturous thoughts but don't actually feel that way.  Even if you know that children are what you are attracted to, that's not your fault.  What you can control is not committing a crime.  I really hope you don't stop taking your meds and I hope you stay on this earth with us.  I think your voice is important - when you come to a healthier place you can help educate the public on OCD and possibly pedophilia.  I would support that 100%."
