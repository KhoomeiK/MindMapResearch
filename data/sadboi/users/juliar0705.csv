DefendingJacob_TV,fquq58g,t1_fqulneu,1589662872.0,"Well I said that because society holds teenage boys and girls to a different standard. As a women, I feel like the “quite girl trope” is almost romanticized because she’s nerdy most of the time and is seen as mysterious. Does that make sense? But really for example, Sansa in GoT acted like a normal teenage girl and the character got a lot of heat from it, even I found her annoying at first. Then I looked back on how I behaved as a teenager and realized a lot of the time teenage girls are bratty and that her character is just a kid. Idk it helped me not find her so annoying after that. 

But yeah, it’s really frustrating because you kind of just want to shake his character and tell him to get his shit together. My 15 year old brother is also named Jacob and has very similar personality traits to this Jacob. Mostly just being very quite, plays video games, is a little nerdy, and is trying to figure out how to appropriately express his emotions. So I might be a little biased lol"
DefendingJacob_TV,fqul0p5,t3_gl1iw1,1589660611.0,"No he’s a 14/15 year old boy who’s scared to show his emotions and is quite. It seems like he was bullied in school before this and that can have a huge impact on how kids behave around their peers. If the role was reversed, and it was a girl, would you be saying the same thing? Also remember he’s probably going through puberty around this time, idk about y’all, but that time period was awkward as fuck and it feels like you have no control over your emotions. Just trying to put it into prospective here.

Edit: Also he’s in 8th grade when this took place and teenagers are stupid as hell. Is his coping mechanism appropriate? No. But he’s sad that basically everyone is blaming him. He’s so skittish the kid couldn’t possibly have done it. So he channels those negative emotions by doing something stupid af, like making a social media account to “give people what they want.”"

LSAT,fopdc9c,t3_g8i5k5,1587958655.0,"LSAT Demon 100% it’s an AI study tool by Nathan Fox and Ben Olsen (who also host The Thinking LSAT Podcast and own their own LSAT prep companies). I’m applying early to my first choice and regular cycle for my other three. Their study materials (including the podcast, which has great no bullshit advise) have helped me the most. My diagnostic was a 145 and my goal is to get to 167-9 by August, and thankfully I’m on track to that! 

Hopefully this is somewhat helpful! I recommend those two guys over everything else on the market. I really appreciate their candor when it comes to just about any topic. Idk just feel like that’s hard to find these days. When it comes to studying I don’t need someone to sugar coat what I’m doing wrong, or else I’m never going to understand WHY I’m getting it wrong. And that’s the most important part, you need to understand that “why” and what you need to do in order to truly grasp what the test is trying to teach."
LSAT,fo3off6,t3_g5eet1,1587490301.0,You need to do the free 7-day trial of the LSAT demon! It’s honestly the best AND most helpful tool. They have a mix of written explanations for the questions (I find the written ones for LR incredibly helpful). The hosts of The Thinking LSAT podcast creates it and I really think it’s the best because they truly cut the bullshit out of the learning process!
TrueCrimePodcasts,fn76hr7,t3_fzm4ot,1586714233.0,"I couldn’t agree more. I went to a Christian university and I was raped by a guy a week after he came back from a mission trip. A year after I reported him to the deans (thanks PTSD) and the following semester I saw on Instagram he was approved to lead a spring break mission trip. After that, my trust in religious leaders went right down the drain."
LSAT,fn75bad,t1_fn749gd,1586713579.0,"Same here! I always point friends who are also in the process of studying to the podcast and the LSAT Demon. Which in turn saves them thousands of dollars when compared to the major study corporations. 

But I totally agree. If you want to improve your score you have to put a lot of work into truly understanding the test. Once you know the rules whole heartedly, then you can figure out what shortcuts work best for you."
LSAT,fn73w4b,t1_fn6dffk,1586712792.0,Ben and Nathan are the BEST in the business I swear. I don’t know why more people don’t use them.
LSAT,fn4py46,t1_fn3qpfn,1586646456.0,"Ok you need to go to LSATdemon.com and do their 7-day trail. The hosts of The Thinking LSAT podcast created it, and honestly it’s the best and most effective study tool I’ve use! AND they provide incredibly helpful explanations for the questions. 

Not to mention it’s significantly cheaper (if you want to continue) than most of the study materials I’ve found."
relationship_advice,fivyho5,t3_f9w43e,1582770924.0,"A very similar situation happened to me almost 4 years ago. I developed PTSD so when I was triggered for the first time, I made the mistake of reporting my rape to the college. I went to a small Christian university in Arkansas and the dean was actually incredible — it sadly was my university’s lack of communication that allowed my rapist to get his master’s degree and lead a spring break mission trip. 

I also tried to go to the police on several different occasions; and each time I was told to come back bc the only sex crimes detective was not there. My number was left behind for her to call me. Weeks went by and nothing happened... 

But, I agree with mostly everyone else on this. Go to the police station and make sure your voice is heard. 

You’ve got this."

psychology,es2l5zg,t1_es2gj6v,1561528398.0,"I have PTSD, and marijuana was a huge help for me when I first started experiencing horrible night terrors and flashbacks. I would smoke or have a little bit of an edible before going to sleep and it worked like a charm. I do it every so often now that I have other forms of coping, but it is still helpful from time to time. I have read some studies about the correlation for those who suffer with PTSD and marijuana uses before sleep, and am interested in learning more. I’ll have to add that book to my wish list!"
piercing,es2kr9w,t1_es2kf13,1561527946.0,Thank you! I’m pretty sure they used a screw ring and it’s been driving me bonkers. So I’ll for sure be revisiting the shop soon to have them look at it!
