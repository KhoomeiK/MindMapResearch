depression,f7cfwa7,t3_dvexlo,1573591382.0,"Hi I’m 23 and 7th grade was absolute hell for me It really fucked with my mental health on top of already growing up depressed. People who spent time befriending me in 6th grade used all that information and made a social media account of me without my knowledge and for months harassed everyone at my school. Everyone in my class hated me and would throw food at me or bitch me out. I couldn’t even go to the bathroom without people trying to cut my hair or corner me. That being said if I could go back and talk to my seventh grade self, I’d tell myself that life doesn’t get easier. But you get stronger and you end up putting up with a lot more shit than you thought you could. I never thought I’d make it past my 13th birthday, my 16th birthday, my 21st birthday, and I’ll probably keep pushing off killing myself but the point is seventh grade will end and life will go on. Trust in yourself and your gut. It takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there for someone you like and honestly fuck her it’s her loss. There will be lots of girls over the years and as long as you are kind, thoughtful, and working on growing as an individual the ladies will come. 

Also please find something to shift from
Instead of hurting yourself. Whether it’s drawing boxing cooking( if you still want to be around something sharp) anything."

I don’t comment a lot but I’m hoping you can see even a bit of the strength a stranger like me sees in you right now.

depression_help,epqz7oh,t3_bvmkq3,1559415239.0,"I don’t know if this will help you but at least regarding small talk, I tend to answer the “ how are you?” question with “ I’m alright”. It’s short enough to the point where I don’t start spilling more than I want to share, but I also don’t feel like I’m lying to people by saying “ oh I’m good”. You’ll find the few people who can handle more venting and from there you can ease into other things you need to vent about.  I struggle with opening up to people about my depression as well and I’m sorry you’re dealing with it too."
