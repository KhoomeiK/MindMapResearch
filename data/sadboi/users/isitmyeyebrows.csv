Like you said, any reason is a valid one. Just like any feeling or emotion someone has is also valid. I feel like so often I subconsciously invalidate or minimize my own feelings because of someone else’s reaction to them - so reading this was helpful on a number of levels.

You’re so right in everything you said - thank you so much for the response!!"

trichotillomania,fma67l8,t3_fryt4j,1585884862.0,"The earliest memory I have of pulling hair wasn’t my own hair. I used to have a Davey Crocket hat where id pull the hair out of it before bed and while holding it watching tv. Then as I got older and my parents had to throw the hat out because there was nothing left to it, I started pulling up a rug in my tv room. Finally when I got to my teen years, the first time I pulled my eyebrows and eyelashes out was when I was watching a tv show that gave me anxiety. And now I tend to pull anytime I have any sort of anxiety and it’s typically only my eyebrows now. It’s wild though knowing I grew up with anxiety and depression and started this habit at such an early age with something that wasn’t even my own hair and it grew (no pun intended lol) into something much larger."

mentalhealth,fm06u1f,t1_flxpfhn,1585647029.0,"Question - are you able to call hotlines in different states from the one you are in? Once I called a hotline when I was in school in South Carolina, and I kept getting the same man over and over again who was picking up. I didn’t want to talk to him any longer because he kept making sexual and suggestive comments to me when I began to calm down (I’m a female) and he kept telling me “I sounded like I was beautiful” and my “voice was sexy” and other really inappropriate comments for someone who is supposed to be helping talk down a suicidal person. 

Anyways, that being said, are you able to specify which states hotline you’re patched through to? I would love to have the option in the future to try different states (perhaps one that is more open and progressed with mental health care) in case that happens again to me or anyone else!"
mentalhealth,fm06ahi,t1_flyroji,1585646414.0,"I’m so happy your wife woke up, your life is so precious. 

I also have had a similar situation where the people on the hotline have hung up on me and treated me poorly and it led me to feel even more alone and attempting. I get that people are humans but there are certain things you shouldn’t be doing (like volunteering at a suicide hotline) if you’re just going to be hanging up or not making more of an effort to be patient.

Paruresis,fifwpsa,t1_ff4bukv,1582393979.0,"I (a female!) am going on a week long trip to South America with my boyfriend of 7-months in May, and have been thinking about talking to my therapist that I see weekly about my Paruresis. 

Can you share with me (if you’re comfortable!) what comes along with the exposure therapy? And have you found it helpful for the past four months / what has your improvement been? 

I’m nervous to start but think it would be really helpful because I want to be more comfortable peeing a.) in front of my boyfriend and b.) in public bathrooms that will probably be different than the ones in America.

Thanks in advance :)"
Paruresis,fifvj76,t1_fgr1hgh,1582393643.0,"I’m so sorry to hear this, that is so awful but you should be so proud of yourself for acknowledging it and starting to process it. 

My Paruresis started in a similar manner, and it also stemmed from being sexually abused. I’m a girl, and as a child around 4 or 5 years old, was sexually abused by another young girl (child on child sexual abuse). She forced me to do certain things to her and forced me to let her do different things to me. One of these things she forced me to do was pee in front of her on the floor of their family basement. 

Once I did do that, she then went upstairs to tell on me, and I was standing there naked in pee, so of course I got in trouble for it. My parents came and got me and yelled and punished me, but didn’t realize that it wasn’t just that I peed in the wrong spot, but that there was deeper underlying issues happening too. And, because I was so young, I didn’t even really know what was going on or how to articulate that I was being forced to do this.

Since then, I could never pee in front of anyone or have anyone around and hear me because I now associate peeing as “shameful” or something that’s worth being punished for. 

Overall, both of our stories are definitely tragic, for lack of a better word. But we truly should both be so proud of ourselves for speaking about it, and not letting that control us! 

I wish the best for you and hope your shy bladder gets better."

Because of this, it might be helpful for you to tell your friends as well. That way if you need to go into the stall, they’ll understand! And I’m sure they’ll understand either way :)"

relationship_advice,feycrp9,t1_feuslnv,1579443847.0,"I know... one half of me really likes that he has so many female friends, but the other half really hates it. I like it because it shows he respects and values all types of relationships with women, but I dislike it because of things like this happening. 

I love the way you put that about her and how she might be “sabotaging” the relationship. It’s a great way to describe what’s going on and how I feel in this situation. 

I’m definitely not the super confrontational type and would rather please everyone and make everyone happy, HOWEVER I’m my own worst enemy in that. I think you’re right that I need to talk to my boyfriend about it and bring it up to him. He definitely hasn’t been isn’t enjoying it and it’s more along the lines of he doesn’t care because he’s also non confrontational and I truly believe he doesn’t know what to say. But it comes to a time where it is an issue because it’s starting to effect our relationship to the point I’m writing on a Reddit thread to get advice.  

Finally, so true about it not being my place to have to win her over. I am nothing but kind to her and it’s her own loss and fault if she’s going to be so rude to me and be bitter that I’m happy with her best guy friend who is also happy being with me.

Thank you so much, these are all such great things to think about and I love getting this other view and opinion on it. Thanks so much for replying and giving me advice :)"
relationship_advice,feybvcd,t1_feugw2p,1579443454.0,"Wow I want to give you the biggest virtual hug right now. This is all in a weird way so comforting to me to hear you validating me and hyping me up and making me come back down to reality. 

The word “possessive” is the perfect word for this situation. She is possessive, and definitely jealous, and the similar situation that happened to your friend sounds like where my situation may be headed. Can I ask what happened to your friends relationship? Did they break up because of this roommate and friend getting in the middle? I know whatever happened with them doesn’t mean it will happen to my relationship, but it’d still be really helpful to hear because it sounds like such a similar thing.

Thank you so much in advance for any future replies but also for this reply. I’m so grateful for you deciding to respond and what you said last is soooooo comforting. He DID choose me, and they had so many opportunities to date before (even though I fully believe he isn’t interested at all romantically). And finally, you are so right. He’s so trustworthy and so kind. 

Thanks so much again!!"
relationship_advice,feyap2q,t1_feu2vnx,1579443083.0,"I love this idea!

relationship_advice,fey9ogu,t1_feu67s7,1579442626.0,Honestly you’re right. At the end of the day the other boyfriend IS irrelevant because he’s not even in this situation and it doesn’t mean she might not have feelings towards my boyfriend even if she has one.

relationship_advice,fey998k,t1_feu3qik,1579442414.0,"That’s a really good point and it’s crossed my mind before that maybe they have hooked up in the past and they might hook up in the future. I definitely trust my boyfriend but I can’t help but think that. 

As far as it goes with what he says, he’s super non-confrontational and sometimes a people pleaser so he never says anything. He’ll respond if the question is directed at him and say something like, “yeah I remember my ex. Why are you bringing her up?” But other than that he pretty much ignores it.

I haven’t brought up yet about if this is normal for her but I’m going to bring it up in casual conversation next time. I’m worried about sounding mean towards her because I’m afraid he’ll get mad and defensive because they’re best friends but I definitely need to.

I feel that sometimes the more you consider it being realistic, the more confident you may become when you’re considering actually following through.

Just remember that you are special and have a wonderful life ahead of you. Please call a suicide hotline if it does get to a point where you’re truly about to attempt, but try your hardest to stop the habit of thinking of suicide as an “exit plan.” You’re strong and I’m sure have so many people who love you and care for you and would be sad if this turned into something more than just a coping mechanism.
