harrypotter,fr5f3w0,t1_fr597az,1589907526.0,"Well as a member of my public education system i spent 8 years learning about the alamo. While an important event in my states history i dont think it merited the majority of my history classes. 
I dont know if youve noticed but my fellow Americans also suffer from this education system. Not to run it home but they outlawed health class in some states. Health class.  

Theres also a proper health care system. Which in itself is something to be said when i was charged over 10k for a procedure i never received waited over 6 hours for the procedure and was discharged without receiving a spinal tap i had to receive somewhere else. Im still disputing it on my credit.  They tried to settle where i just pay the 2k for the 2 bags of saline.


I honestly hate my media. It forces these idealistic forms of human garbage and thats what kids idolize. And look im not saying its great there but your not exactly worried if your crack head neighbors are going to shoot up the local walmart bc they were told to wear a mask and wash their hands ok? 

You dont have a leader that cherishes corporations over human life. This may just been an outsider looking in or a its always greener on the other side but it seems like a general respect for one another that you dont really see here."

badwomensanatomy,fr2u6rv,t1_fr2tdbv,1589843967.0,So it really depends on arousal and whether or not shes been sexually active or if she works out those muscles. Yes just like you can clench certain muscles and make ur dick move we can tighten the muscles in our vagina. The more aroused a woman is the more capable of stretching it is. Yes a vagina is made out of like the worlds most stretchy material but it doesnt stay stretched out. Just like if you take a really large shit your asshole isnt a gaping hole. There are maximum stretch points and thats called child birth lmfao jk jk but really if a woman isnt aroused enough or there isnt enough work up to something like fisting you can actually cause ripping which is incredibly painful but does heal good as new. Hope i answered some questions for ya

The last two examples are pretty much how they analyze novels in english or political cartoons. You can analyze a video game in the same way you just have to look at it objectively. The question is whether or not games will be used like those other facets of literature and media. I think its very likely it will be in a variety of subjects. You know when i was younger they even used video games as homework to teach us different things like math, history, english ect. Its already implemented in a few different ways i just think it will be more wide spread in the coming years"

AskReddit,fr2aox2,t1_fr283n3,1589834038.0,"I mean it depends in the game. I actually think it says a lot about a person what they do in a game like skyrim.  It can determine someones thought process. Do they run through the game? Do they stay and listen to the npc commentary? Do they follow instructions? Do they go off the beaten path? It could say a lot about the psychology of the actual player. 

Think about how enlightened people were to find out about women actually partaking in some of the major wars because of gamer aggravations that their were female selections in games like battlefield.  Thats another thing you can use games for. To have children actually be interested in learning about wars. Have them go through campaigns in games based of of actual battles and discuss how they differ from reality and why might the creators have taken those liberties. You can dissect them like you would a work of fiction from a certain era, how pften they comment on whats going on or what the author might have been going through at the time of creation.

Plague inc a well known disease creation game cane out with its counter part where you have to cure a world wide pandemic after the quarantine and after the jokes about ‚Äúok who left their game running‚Äù jokes or the Jesus playing plague inc meme.

Sanders had a good chance to win the popular vote but he has too many grand ideas to benefit the lower class so the dem party isnt going to let him win the nomination. He costs too much. And again even if he won the popular vote he wont get the electoral college. 

The people have no say in who is voted in for president. Like none. Our votes arent needed for the electoral college. People can continue to down vote but i have a fb post from 1 day after trump announced his presidential run saying hes going to win the presidency.

Yea it was definitely not easy to be a teenager and not be able to do something because i had to be home to take care of her. My dad was an alcoholic who just couldnt be bothered with it and my mom hadn‚Äôt been in the picture  for quite sometime at that point. I took care of her until i was 17. Even though it was really hard that was the only time i ever lived in one place that long. I may of had to be in charge of her feedings, medicine, bathroom needs and companionship but i also didnt go hungry so it was worth it to me.

Also if you can prove how they can sustain livability without alimony or where you cant maintain livability by paying alimony a judge wont order it. Not always does someone pay the other person in the divorce. And you can say what you want about everyone thinking your a dick for a prenup but why is it anyone else‚Äôs fucking business? Are they in the relationship? Are they fucking either of you? Then their opinions is moot. If you genuinely have enough money where you are financially caring for someone and i mean that you are paying all of their bills.

But its ok to wait. It really is. If you want to wait there are a ton of young men and women who have chosen to wait until marriage. 

Edit: just realized ur the same dude from the previous degrading comment to women so im taking the sweetness out. You are still a virgin by choice?

Yes do going through those hard bits build our relationship sure but so does a game night or a steamy night of passion or a walk in the park with our son or god sometimes just a drive around the block singing along with the radio. I guarantee a lot more of those divorces caused by gaming were more that the solely game obsessed person ignored their partners wants and needs. Once you stop making time for each other and enjoying the time you get together you start to lose the love and theres a sad reality that the older you get the less time you get with your so. Because of work, our kid, our dog, oooph and all the little fires that pop up along the way.  All of my pre marriage friends thought id be single in 5 years bc well i wasnt that kind of a girl but hes the person i know i can tackle any problem with."

wholesomememes,fqsb03h,t1_fqs9xhj,1589602601.0,You have missed every point. If you arent in a relationship you have no idea how one works you can only theorize. Its not a problem in maintaining relationship. What makes it different is that you can have fun with it and make an experience out of it instead of it just being watching tv. If you for a second think games are easy you must never take anything off normal probably dont even game you just wanted to say something argumentative. Or make a point that didnt need to be made. I really honestly hope you are single because if you think you can only bond by splitting up house chores you are going to have a very sad and miserable partner. What makes life worth living is the good experiences we share.  A video game yes can be a form of escapism but they are also a great stress reliever and if you want to know how it teaches team work i challenge you to play one round of overcooked and get three stars with anyone of your friends cuz i know you cant do it with an so even if you had one.  Your life must be a living hell if you have no enjoyment in your life. Im not saying that gaming is the base of a relationship but that it builds a relationship and you are too moronic to hear it.

wholesomememes,fqrz8tr,t1_fqrybz3,1589595073.0,"You didn‚Äôt even read that article. It said several times gamers and non-gamers relationships, it also says game obsessions, and you even said part of the problem ‚Äúmen playing video games‚Äù. Women taking the time to join in on their husbands hobbies and vice versa is how you build a relationship. A good relationship where you enjoy each other passions. I didn‚Äôt say every relationship is like mine and i also never said it was the only thing keeping us together i said its what keeps us happy together. We get to get those daily frustrations out together. We have to build our communications skills because we have to be a TEAM. We also play board games together, read the same books, we cook together, we stay up all night talking and we love each other.  Are you married?"
wholesomememes,fqrxess,t1_fqrx6e3,1589593944.0,Dude. If you can play a competitive game with each other and do well it counts for a lot more than you think. Its also a give and take. Its all about communication. Fyi my husband and i game together and we also work well together but the bonding we have done through gaming is what keeps us happy as a couple.
wholesomememes,fqrx77t,t1_fqrsfk0,1589593812.0,No its really not. You genuinely cant hear your own game if there are two tvs hell its even worse split screen. If you and so decide to clear a set of buildings you go right she goes left you are going to want to be able to hear.
