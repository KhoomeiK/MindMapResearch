I didn’t make it to the point where I felt pain, just immense stress that “I might actually suffocate to death right now in the next few minutes.”"

unpopularopinion,fj0es0a,t1_fiz2gz2,1582898175.0,"Incorrect: ESAs are still needed for many people, such as myself. This is why an actual ESA isn’t bullshit for people like me: ESAs don’t have the same rights as Service Animals in public spaces. I cannot bring my ESA into a restaurant, Airport, or any place really that doesn’t generally allow pets. No, an ESA that has actually been prescribed to a person by a licensed mental health professional is not considered a “pet,” however they do not have the right to be with their owner in public. ESA rights come in regarding the person’s living situation and needing accommodation (such as an apartment complex not usually allowing dogs, for example, over 20lbs.. reasonable accommodation applies if that persons prescribed ESA happens to weigh more, things like that, and also waiving things like Pet Rent). 

Many people abuse and are uneducated about what service animals and ESAs do. Not just anything can legitimately “certify” their service dog. Any online thing advertising this is a scam. A legal, ethical situation always includes a doctor’s prescription of said animal. A Service Animal is prescribed by a doctor, and the animal performs specific tasks for the person which is why they must be with them, even in public places. Even though ESAs are still needed, it isn’t in this capacity, where they need to fetch medicine, find a chair for their owner, or perform whatever task needed. 

If someone says they “certified” their animal online, and their animal isn’t actually a part of their medical routine, they’re a hoax. I know many people who put those service dog vests on their untrained terriers just to walk around with them; anyone can buy those things, and service animals are also not required to wear them. Some people really ruin the whole situation for people who actually don’t abuse the system. Unfortunately, most establishments aren’t allowed to ask much about a persons “service animal” as far as it’s legitimacy, however, if the animal is causing a disturbance or damage, they are allowed to ask them to leave.

I hope that was informative. Some people suck, but I literally need my ESA. He stays home with me and the only public places we go are already “pet friendly.” Because he’s not trained as a service animal, I don’t need him to perform a specific task for my safety, we aren’t entitled to being allowed elsewhere, as we shouldn’t. But he is prescribed to me by a licensed mental health professional, because I need him emotionally. He has kept me alive many times when I would otherwise be dead."

I stare at her as she goes in, obviously trying to avoid confrontation with me, as I climb over my passenger seat and get out on that side. On the way back, I had hoped she had made her way out of the spot without damaging my car (I got her license plate number before going in- there’s a small window of opportunity that she wouldn’t have damaged my car backing out), but she hadn’t left yet and was still in store. Long story short I keyed her car, scrambled to get back in mine, and slowly backed out. This is when I saw her return. I stopped and parked my car and stared at her until she finally left.

What was the game changer for my hair texture was treating my hair like it was curly rather than straight (which it’s more wavy, with curls here and there, but I always brushed my hair and didn’t condition it enough for my hair type). I started using hair masks weekly in the shower with a shower cap and getting regular trims (once every month or so). Combing through with a wide toothed comb rather than a brush (again, curl-prone hair here). And a light leave-in conditioner after the shower. I also do an apple cider vinegar rinse about once a week (after shampooing, I dilute ACV in with a good amount of water and pour it over my hair and scalp- I mostly do this for my psoriasis as it calms it down but it does make my hair strands smoother than if I hadn’t done the rinse. After letting the ACV solution sit for a couple of minutes, I rinse well and then condition my ends with a mask or conditioner, let it sit in a shower cap for about 5 mins and rinse well). After getting out of the shower while my hair is still very wet, I lightly apply a leave-in conditioner to my ends, and wrap it up in a hair turban with soft fibers for a bit and then let air dry.

BPD,fch1scg,t1_fch160f,1577646437.0,"Maybe, if I frame it like I’m doing things just to keep them in my life. But I’m thinking that I just want to bring them happiness when I’m doing things."
trashy,fcgdtb2,t1_fcg20xt,1577638932.0,I’ve found that people who are depressed or deal with their mental health tend to be more emotionally intelligent in a lot of ways.
BPD,fcgc3jn,t3_eh33lv,1577638477.0,"This crosses my mind a lot. I have to seriously sit myself down sometimes and have the “am I on the ASPD spectrum” talk, but a few hours later I’m trying to show love to someone out of the goodness of my heart. Super confusing."
tattoos,fcg93bq,t1_fcg7v87,1577637760.0,"Yeah, I agree with the clarity-after comment. In the future I’m going to practice meditating to find that clarity instead of self harming, I know it has to be possible even if it’s mostly requiring my patience, but I think what cutting has done for me is just give me a “real” type of pain that I can understand and validate. But the truth is, we can do that without inflicting physical pain. We have to teach ourselves how to validate those feelings with self-love instead."
tattoos,fcg6gu6,t1_fcfutdr,1577636921.0,"Preface: this is not encouragement to engage in self harm. I have struggled with this before, and still do, and it is a problem. I’m choosing to respond to this comment because I think sharing where I’ve been mentally at those times can help others if they’ve ever felt the same, or want to understand others who do.

Working out is like indirectly good for you if you’re doing it to punish or harm yourself. When I’m as low as I have been when I’ve self harmed by cutting, my energy is all gone. I’m usually lying on the floor and just completely drained mentally, emotionally and physically already. I am to a point that I 100% believe I would be better off dead, and even though I don’t want to die, I’m incredibly distraught at how worthless I feel and that feeling wants validation. When I’m there, no, I don’t have energy to run or do anything that will be good for me in any form, even indirectly. I feel so completely guilty of existing that I find it hard to be good to myself in any capacity.

Of course, it’s all over after a while. I have Borderline Personality Disorder, which is intense and exhausting emotionally for me. As a silver lining to having BPD, I can also always count on my episode to pass (even though it might return in a few hours again). But the point was, people who self harm similar to the way I have before are probably also feeling sub-human. I also deal with DP/DR and it makes those times even harder to get a grip during. I don’t think someone who has never been that low can possibly understand, but I wouldn’t ever want my loved ones to understand how it feels to be here. Just imagine if you thought you were worth less than trash, like you’re wasting oxygen, like you don’t deserve anything, and all you can think about is the bad things. It’s a dark dark hole that you don’t want to let yourself go into if you can help it.

Last thing: I don’t want anyone feeling alarmed or worrying about me. I have a dog who I would never leave behind for anything at all. I would suffer through 100 hells for him, he is absolutely the best thing to ever happen to me, and he’s my best friend. If anyone else deals with self harm, please check yourself. Ask yourself what it’s going to solve, just wait a little longer and see if your emotions blow over first. It’s easy to get into these habits but to someone who deeply cares about others like I do, I’m telling you that I’m feeling your pain. You don’t have to cut. Make yourself walk away. And lastly, forgive yourself. For your past scars and for how you are too hard on yourself. Get help if you need it, but do your best to stay strong, always standing back up when you fall."

BorderlinePDisorder,fc9mklm,t1_fc9lzut,1577554930.0,"I have partially- the only reason I haven’t fully especially with the shampoos is because in the past year I’ve developed random scalp psoriasis, and I’m using a medicated shampoo which helps it but doesn’t necessarily adhere to the ingredient “rules” for CGM shampoo. But I have taken heed on conditioning well and that alone has made a pretty good improvement on my hair’s softness"
