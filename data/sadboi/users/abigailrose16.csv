 It’s never a lack of understanding thing. It’s just sometimes people come to office hours not in good faith, they haven’t tried to solve their problem or they aren’t being open to new solutions, which is typically frustrating if there’s a lot of students who need help.

uofm,fq1m0ut,t3_ggfsmo,1589046838.0,"Nah not really. It’s about integrity and making smart choices. There are SO many resources available now, and so much focus on making more and more and more available. Pretty much every programming class has at least 30 hours of office hours a week, frequently more (especially with the move to virtual, a class I taught offered 72 hours of office hours a week after the switch). There’s videos galore, and for nearly all these classes, it’s totally ok to talk concepts and project planning with your friends in the class. If you go to office hours early and start early, you’ll have no issue. 

The honor code disproportionately penalizes people who procrastinate and aren’t willing to put in the additional work that comes with that. And honestly? I’m fine with that. And I’ve been personally burned by it! I’ve suffered a lower grade on a project than what I would have earned by starting early and addressing my problems sooner. But ya know what? That’s on me. Could I have cheated to fix it? Almost certainly. Did I? No. It’s my fault for putting myself in that situation, and I’d rather take an L on the grade than be dishonest. If you procrastinate, you have to accept that resources (such as office hours availability and autograder submits) will be less available to you by virtue of procrastinating. If you’re not prepared to complete this project with that disadvantage, that’s on you. 

If you had a legitimate reason for starting late or not having time to work, lots of EECS classes are relatively lenient with extensions. If you got sick, or had a family emergency, they’ll give you a very reasonable length extension. It can be hard to swallow your pride and ask for one (at least it was for me) but they’re there if you need them. When I had a semester where I had a lot of medical issues, the course staff were very supportive and understanding and I got several extensions when necessary. Even when I only spent one day (like twelve hours) in the emergency room, I still got like a three day extension that was supportive of the fact that the exact time you miss for something major isn’t necessarily equal to the time you lost on the work. 

A lot of people complain about how the honor code is unrealistic in the real world because of how much code copying happens. I’ve been working as a software developer (both in the summers and part time during the year) for about four years now. And when people say that, they’re wrong. The instances where you find code online that solves your problem is vastly more common for courses that most people take vs having an actual real world problem. Sure sometimes you find “starter code” in the documentation for the tool you’re using, but it’s mostly vague stack overflow answers to someone’s similar but also very different question. I legitimately believe the honor code prepares you for a world where 99% of the time, the work you want will not be sitting online or on a friends computer. You’ll have to synthesize information from lots of places and turn it into code. That’s just how it is."

Most of them admit after that partway through they realized it wouldn’t live up to expectations and started worrying about the stock they’ve accumulated. They just made an unwise move, they aren’t inherently bad people.

it doesn’t hurt anyone to have reform that improves life for everyone. better social safety nets lead to better outcomes for everybody. if we had them before this pandemic, it might have been less bad. low wage workers face pressure to go to work even when they’re sick. low income people are incredibly reluctant to seek medical care they can’t afford. a society ought to be judged by how it treats its most vulnerable."

honestly one of the biggest predictors of future employment in any field is how passionate you are about the field. in engineering, there are slightly more job opportunities for people who don’t really care about their field but in general, the people who are successful in any field are the ones who believe in what they’re doing and feel passionate about the topic. it really shows in job interviews, and it also gives you the passion and drive to find that career that you want. i’m not saying that every single major has an abundance of career options because it doesn’t. but the career options that exist in any major or any field go to the people who really want them and feel strongly about those opportunities. 

if you have that feeling about any major, chase it. and also, there are no right or wrong decisions in life. just different decisions with different outcomes.

edit: also upward mobility isn’t everything. financial security is really important (i currently do not have it, it’s very stressful), but it typically doesn’t require significant upward mobility. financial security can also come from making smart decisions about the money you have and living frugally. plus, imo, an overlooked component of upward mobility is life enjoyment. if you’re constantly working and stressing about your situation or stuck in a job that makes you miserable for an extra few grand a year, you haven’t moved up in the world."

This isn’t an online school. It has immense infrastructure to support and all of the staff and services required to support that. 

Public universities are NOT profitable. The money you spend on tuition goes to paying directly for the services you receive and to research and to maintaining academic resources. Your tuition is paying for BlueJeans, for Zoom, for the Adobe Creative Suite for art/film students, for pretty much all the online infrastructure you’re using. Your university Google account costs money, the university has had to spend more money shoring up all of these online resources and getting more resources so that people can keep working towards that valuable degree. Enterprise video conferencing is not free! Canvas is not free! None of online learning is free! It requires some additional expense for online specific services like Zoom added in the face of this, while not being able to receive the same amount of funding for things like research. Please be compassionate for the people who work here. And be compassionate for the researchers, who rely on these resources. And Michigan Medicine."

EDanonymemes,fnt1bhz,t1_fnsbrck,1587232720.0,"out of all mental illnesses, bipolar disorder has the highest mortality rate (20%). how do i know this? i have been exceedingly blessed to have both anorexia with lifelong complications (yay!!) and bipolar disorder! clearly i hit the mental illness jackpot 💁🏻‍♀️"
EDanonymemes,fnt15nx,t1_fnszhka,1587232633.0,"yup! people don’t usually die from an eating disorder per se, they die from a health complication or suicide due to intense mental stress/depression brought on or exacerbated due to the disorder"
EDanonymemes,fnt114k,t1_fnsxxkx,1587232566.0,"that’s very true but also cuts both ways. a lot of people who die by suicide (even if directly/indirectly caused by their eating disorder) usually won’t be counted in that statistic either. the statistics usually come from following a specific diagnosed group of people, and doing a longitudinal study to see where they’ve ended up after several years. death statistics in general can be unreliable for the reason you pointed out, especially since a lot of health complications/suicides don’t immediately make people think eating disorder unless someone is severely underweight unfortunately :/"
EDanonymemes,fnscfey,t1_fnsbrck,1587218523.0,actually a shockingly high percentage of eating disorder mortality is actually from the same indirect causes as other mental illnesses

catfood,fnjbfvh,t3_frd0ys,1586995615.0,"A good switch to start with might be to wet food! Lots of wet foods are created specifically with cat needs in mind (look for higher quality brands, my cat will vouch for Tiki Cat). Some vegetables/carbs (a good example being pumpkin) can actually be good for cats and their digestion, but if you see those on the label you'll want to look into why they're there and what the benefits are. The raw diet can have risks as you mentioned, but both raw and cooked homemade diets will be very time intensive, especially once school restarts in the fall. Wet food can provide a drastic increase in food quality for a limited amount of time invested (if your cat was free-fed before, wet food means you'll have to have scheduled feeding times but that's about the only time commitment)."
catfood,fnjav8v,t3_g1yrxm,1586995300.0,"My cat was \*obsessed\* with Tiki when I could afford it, but I was feeding him the tuna variety ones. However, I know the tuna ones had pumpkin in them which I think did wonders for my cat's digestion, and I don't see that in the Tiki chicken, but I do see it in the Nature's Instinct.

From what I can see, both are perfectly fine options! You might consider getting a small amount of each and offering them to your cat to see which one they prefer. Ultimately, the food that your cat is happiest to eat will probably be the best one in the long run, if cost is not an issue."

Assistance,fnja4vl,t3_g1u0cu,1586994888.0,"This would be so helpful for me, I’m a college student who was already relying on a food pantry to eat and I just found out the job I was supposed to take this summer was cancelled due to COVID-19. I was relying on that to pay for my expenses going into next year since I’m entirely putting myself through college as I no longer have contact with my abusive family, so now I’m scrambling to find as many low wage jobs as I can work at one time just to pay rent and tuition. It’s just such a stressful and awful experience, I finally got on Medicaid but it’s almost impossible to get food stamps as a college student even if you’re literally starving :(. I just applied for a second time but I have no idea when/if I’ll hear back since HHS in my state is totally overwhelmed right now. And to top it off, I won’t be getting the stimulus check because my parents insist on claiming me as a dependent even though we do not speak and it was too late for me to dispute that."
latebloomerlesbians,fngajdt,t1_fnea0it,1586926528.0,"I have not, I had a similar situation occur with my family which is where the financial advice comes from. I’m still in touch with my younger siblings (one of whom i essentially raised) but I don’t have kids of my own."

OCD,fne60x2,t1_fndgiuy,1586883677.0,I second this! Gender is not a binary but OCD looooves to make things into binaries and it can cause a lot of pain.
latebloomerlesbians,fne5s8h,t3_g0wxsg,1586883555.0,"I will be honest I don’t know what an LMT is but I cannot stress enough how important it is to get a job asap. I would also open your own non joint bank account if you don’t already have one (you should be able to do this online depending on your bank of choice). You may not be able to get a job in your field to start (especially right now) but any job will do. There’s also ways to make side money online if you have marketable internet skills you can do remotely but those typically won’t provide a full income, they just supplement one. 

You’ll want to have probably 3 months of living expenses saved up before you decide to relocate. I would coincide having the talk with your husband at a time when you’re prepared financially to relocate. You may not need to relocate right away but it can also be difficult to tell how someone might react, so it’s always good to be prepared. 

In terms of moving closer to your family, you might want to announce to them (assuming they don’t already know) around the same time you announce to your husband. Again, it can be challenging to tell how people will react. Sometimes people are okay with others being gay, but if it’s their child/wife/close family member, they have a different and less tolerant reaction (this has happened to me).

If you have at least some supportive family, you might want to reach out and ask if you can stay with them for a short while if you don’t immediately have a place to live in the vicinity. I recommend searching for places to live while you’re saving, but there’s also a chance your husband may be supportive and you can stay at your home for a short while and work out an optimal living arrangement during that time. If that’s not an option, you’ll want to rely on a supportive family member or a hotel while you get a place. 

Also, I don’t know how far away your family is but I’d encourage you to remain in the same city as your husband and kids if possible. If your husband is willing to get on board with a co parenting agreement, it can be really really beneficial for your kids to have you close and around because this is something they will need to cope with too. You’ll also need to develop an age appropriate plan for what to say to them to explain the situation. Although you and your husband definitely do not need to be together for your kids to have a healthy and happy childhood, they will still benefit greatly from having two loving parents involved in their life on a day to day basis. You may also need to consider the costs of a divorce lawyer and custody proceedings when saving up. 

I wish you the best of luck and I hope you have the smoothest possible escape!"
