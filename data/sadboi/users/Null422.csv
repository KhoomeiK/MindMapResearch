I've been playing guitar since I was 10 and started playing the violin last year (I'm 26 now). To put that into perspective, I've been playing guitar on-and-off for 16 years. Violin is significantly more difficult due to uneven intonation (no frets!), tuning issues (friction pegs are much harder to keep in tune), posture/ergonomics (back, shoulder, arm, wrist, hand, and finger positioning are all important), using a bow in general (not as simple as using a pick), and a far less forgiving experience overall. 

The violin is an amazing instrument and I wish I had picked it up earlier. I got bored of playing the guitar, to be honest. I adored it since I was a kid, but I didn't want to be the ""violin girl"" and my school had a terrible music program. I'm so happy I started at all and I wish you the best moving forward!"

crochet,fdqh7rk,t3_emq3ix,1578666593.0,"Kind of dumb, but I just started crocheting and am making a giant scarf, something to the effect of 48"" by 6"", all sc. This necessitates hours of sustained attention to even get one row done. I accidentally started another row in the middle of my current one, I can't frog it, and so I did this weird decrease for one row, stopped the row above it, and now have to finish the row I started, stop the new row in the middle, join it, and then start over on the next row. It's ridiculously involved for just ""single crochet x400 forever."" 

It took a while last night to figure out the game plan moving forward, but ""decrease, finish row, join 50% of new row, stop, start new row"" seems to be the winning strategy. This is way higher-order than my knitting ever was and it's both exhilarating and infuriating."
violinist,fdqgui2,t3_emlzam,1578666332.0,"Rent first and save up. $300 will not buy you anything worthwhile. The cut-off for ""halfway decent"" is $500 (and even my teacher hates those violins). I'm a 5'2"" woman and I can play a 4/4, so I wouldn't worry too much about it unless you're doing crazy stretches or octave jumps."
violinist,fdqgmi6,t1_fdq89w8,1578666170.0,"I bought the ""eBoot"" practice mute off of Amazon for $5 and it's amazing (plus has ""VIOLIN MUTE"" loudly embossed in it for extra effect). The resonance is dampened considerably and you can still hear yourself. It's not whisper-quiet, but it's good enough in the apartment that I'm in."
violinist,fdqgex7,t1_fdqfm3y,1578666017.0,"In his defense: A) he sounds remarkably well-informed (and probably in a better position to judge than any of us) and B) violin is inherently a ""pompous"" instrument, so deal with it."
ADHD,fdnzdr4,t1_fdmpgqm,1578595940.0,"In my darker days, I would track how long I spent on YouTube via some sort of usage tracker and cut myself off. That was the only ""compromise"" I could reach: all-or-nothing."
ADHD,fdnzaop,t1_fdkyx01,1578595890.0,"I don't bother with the playlists because they're on auto-play by default (with zero incentive to turn that off), have no ad breaks, and basically just continue forever. I only watch series that have defined episodes or very short sequences and rarely watch gaming on YouTube unless I'm watching a walkthrough or something."
ADHD,fdnz4yb,t1_fdmbjdo,1578595797.0,"Thanks. I'll have to consider it. I already have LeechBlock for the social media platforms, two ad-blockers, and had a time-tracker (to gauge how much time you spend on websites) for a while.

ADHD,fdnytuc,t1_fdmyk1e,1578595619.0,"I always gravitated towards the stoic, hyper-organized characters in games mostly so I could live vicariously through their meticulously-ordered, low-drama lives. It's definitely a form of wish fulfillment for me."
ADHD,fdnymdy,t1_fdmab2b,1578595499.0,"I'm binge-watching ""Game of Thrones"" and I've started to notice that, as the actors' confidence and specificity of their lines increases, the more they seem to ad-lib or insert words as some sort of verbal tic (e.g. ""my lord"" with every highborn person ever even if they're not actually a lord). It throws off the timing and irritates me a little, but I've gotten more used to it."

I have to turn on the floor lamp and sit by it (even though I have great vision normally) just to find each loop. I switched to a larger hook as well because this skein makes tighter loops, making it even harder to see and curling my scarf even more. What an experience."

violinist,fawyj0z,t1_fawbahw,1576376783.0,Couldn't you have moved it closer down the violin towards the pin? It would fit perfectly in the middle between the tuners and the end of the saddle.
