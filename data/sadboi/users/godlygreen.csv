socialskills,eu47uoq,t3_ceko3g,1563442976.0,"Hey dude, sounds like you had a great first day of high school! Just a few things. . .

I am THRILLED you are focusing on aspects of communication outside of sex. It is okay to think about sex and want sex, it's even okay to talk about sex, especially with someone you are planning on being physical with. But there is a time and a place. You are in high school now, and these will be some of the best years of your life. It would be wise to sit and mull over the things you really want to gain from these years. Do you want to build strong friendships, grow as a human being, get good grades, be involved in extra curriculars and take up new hobbies? The sky is the limit, and with our brains all wrapped up in things like sex or drugs, we create less space for what it is we actually want. 

""Friend zone"" isn't a thing. There are only friends and people you expect more from but don't give enough of a damn about to keep around when they only want to be friends. Think about which party that makes the creep, to use a word of your choosing.

It's brilliant that you're already thinking about these things, and I noticed from the comments you are open to the advice given, which only gives you a greater leg up.  You are headed in a good direction, keep going (but remember perfection isn't expected of anybody and mistakes are human)."

I brought it up to my mom, who doesn't really understand how my brain works and doesn't ever coddle me, even when I need it, and she made a good point. The activities they planned were not kid friendly, and I never have a babysitter. It makes sense they wouldn't invite me to something like that, but it still stings.
