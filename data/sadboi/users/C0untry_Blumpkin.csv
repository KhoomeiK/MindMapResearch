The enemy is so far beneath them morally that they *shouldn't* be allowed to speak.  They're barely even *human*, the trouble is they've put anyone who asks questions or falls out of lockstep on *any* issue into the same category as the rAcIsT NaZiS that have taken over the world and internet over the past several years.  

Unfortunately the supply for racism isn't quite meeting demand and so I get to see more people I once considered allies do more and more reprehensible shit to try to - what?  Start a race war?  Get a GoFundMe going?  Idpol sucks and is fundamentally regressive.  If I hadn't found stupidpol I'd probably still be thinking I'm the only one who has been ostracized from the ""team"" for various petty reasons.  That includes being told to STFU because I was a ""white cishet male who should NEVER speak unless asked to by a POC"".

cringe,fr3p3rj,t1_fr3g4xy,1589862535.0,"Bro, you're kinda preaching to the choir here.  I lean left on nearly everything aside from guns but the Dems are complete idiots who are about to learn the hard way that people (you've spent months or *years* shitting on) do not appreciate when you straight up remove democracy from the voting process.   Identity politics is a sham used by the Republicrat Oligarchy to keep the rest of America fighting amongst themselves so the elites can forward their agendas whilst we peasants are looking at something shiny somewhere else.

My disdain for the encouragement of permanent bodily disfigurement in the face of mental illness... is *vast*.   Brainwashing your kids by raising them around the freakiest freaks that ever freaked and nudging them toward whatever the result the ""parents"" have in mind is so sad and fucked up.  That shit they do to that 8 year old drag queen or whatever kid is likely child abuse in a sane world.  These people, *otherkin especially*, need proper psychiatric help for their myriad issues but because the left has a huge grasp on society and pop culture, which bolsters the empty headed morons parading around the internet championing people (they don't give a real shit about) for likes and other social currency.  People that don't always *want* to be pandered to, treated like a child, and have a white savior.  It's absurd to focus on minor differences in pigmentation, melanin is not a character trait.  

But the way reddit has it anything right of chapotraphouse is considered alt-right at best and a ""hate sub"" at worst.  People typically won't engage you if you try to have an honest discourse, and only the leftist run subs (which are legion nowadays) routinely ban anyone they don't like or who asks a tough question, despite no rules having been broken.  Still voting for Bernie, but honestly I can't help but feel like I'm voting against my own self interest."

If you're a guy who does train, you spend a *lot* of time learning ways to use your own body to exert control over someone else.  That will show in a situation that calls for hands-on, just as it shows when you watch a video of police officers that have only done the bare minimum (if any) grappling vs a live opponent.

I started wrestling as a little buckaroo (5), and picked up BJJ in college.  When you have a lot of grappling experience, you're going to have a different perspective from those who don't.  I understand that it isn't a ""fight"" in that you're not throwing punches or allowed to do certain chokeholds (which is absurd especially regarding blood chokes), but you're still using your body to control and subdue another human being.

I mentioned several of them and the various arbitrary reasons I got banned in my other comment.  There is literally a cabal of extreme leftist powermods engaging in disgusting behavior both on AHS and discord to silence anyone  they don't like, including other lefties (myself included). 

 First, they tried to paint everyone in subs like WRD (r/watchredditdie) as nazis, racists, etc.  When that didn't work, they began engaging in false flag posting to try and get WRD taken down.  The mods there had anticipated this, so they'd already been in contact with admins about potential brigading and false flagging from AHS.  So after yet another failure, an AHS mod convo on discord outlined their plan to use *child pornography* to yet again attempt to silence those they disagree with.  One of the people involved ended up blowing the whistle out of disgust, causing quite a stir.

We're not talking about a rogue mod here and there banning people from their subs.  These people have systematically infiltrated larger, non political subs and will pre-emptively ban people who haven't even posted there due to posts they made in other subs.  The censorship memes you see all over are referring to these people.  Go to WRD or r/declineintocensorship and you can see for yourself.

So yes, both sides engage in shitty, petty, tribal behavior.  Banning people from a sub for saying things you don't like is shitty regardless of who is doing it.  But there is a difference between that and engaging in criminal behavior to enforce sitewide personal druthers.  The reason there are more liberals doing this is because, like I said, the righties are much larger fans of constitutional rights."
