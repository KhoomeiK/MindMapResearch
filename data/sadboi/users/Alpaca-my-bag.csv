We had double classes even in just ordinary UK high school/6th form. Just how the timetabling went, sometimes you get a double class. If I remember it happened more often once picking your own classes from year 10 onwards.

Also seen houses and house points used in many schools over here. We had houses in our primary school (proud Celt here!), but we just had two “bands” at my high school. But watching documentaries some schools still have houses. Not sure about boarding schools but it seems like they might use houses more due to school tradition/reputation. 

In 6th form (age 16-18) we had a common room. It was generally just where we all hung out on free periods. 

Really depends on the school the terminology regarding years. Some of the private schools, use 1st year etc and may still be used in boarding schools but for most of us it’s year 7 (age 11) to year 11 (age 16). Then we can choose to go to college, get a job or stay at 6th form (age 16-18) if the school has one.

OWLs are essentially our GCSEs (year 11) and NEWTs are A levels (taken year 13 at 6th form or at  a college)."

MaliciousCompliance,fk7qvya,t1_fk6n49c,1583941901.0,"I used to hide my depression and anxiety from employers but the effect on my sick record and increase in anxiety made that unsustainable. 

Since telling my employers/managers, all but 1 of them have been supportive. The one who wasn’t was a bullying bitch and one of the reasons I’ve spent most of the past 2 years off sick and currently awaiting medical redeployment. 

Honestly, I know it is hard to open up, especially when you have a fear of authority figures like me and clam up when anxious. I was really paranoid about my manager for a while that she hated me, so that was a difficult time for telling them I was getting too anxious. But it is good to make them aware before you become ill, so they can offer reasonable adjustments and support.

About 2 months ago I was really anxious and crying during my work meeting and managed to open up about my issue with phones, so now I am able to email instead and that has been so helpful.

For this episode of sickness, I was trying to push through at work but not coping, and my manager asked if I am well enough to be there. Saying they just want me to feel better and if I need more time off that’s ok.

Edit: I also had 10 sessions of private therapy paid for by work so it’s a good idea to see if there’s any help available through work. Still on a 6 month waiting list for therapy without going through work (though it is free so can’t complain- I’m from UK)"

I know in the UK we have law/policy to ensure LGBTQ+ patients are treated with dignity and respect, as it should be.

Obviously assigned sex at birth would still be important to know too. For example fully transitioned transgender women still have the risk of prostate cancer etc that men do, so a good doctor would refer to the patient with their preferred pronouns but still be aware of assigned sex at birth and offer tests/treatment required for that patient in a person centred way."

I can see that you were trying to be helpful and you are not in the wrong for offering, and I understand that words come out wrong at times despite the best intentions. I also see how she could be so offended from the wording:

“oh I’ve got a TON of clothes from before I lost all the weight. You can see if you want any!”

I don’t think the main issue was mentioning plus size or her weight, but by saying “**all**” the weight you drew attention to how much weight you lost and therefore how much larger she is than you at present. Probably made her feel like an elephant. And then imagine she turns up and all your clothes are too small? She’d feel humiliated. And although you say you are good friends, this sounds a new enough friendship for her to be more offended, as she doesn’t know your weight history/seen photos of your past weight? 

I mean going and chatting to all your mutual friends could be a slight asshole move on her part (as the wording could be on your part), but honestly everyone has a moan to friends when they’re angry/upset. And the friends may have noticed she looked down and probed her as to why."

As noted on a previous reply, try to get a specialist therapist in anxiety/loss of basic needs. And you possibly could do with some therapy regarding the assaults too? Although I totally get if you can’t face that, I like to repress the bad stuff myself. 

Good luck, I know you must feel awful for what you’ve done but try not to let the personal comments hurt you too much. You are not an inherently bad person, you developed a bad coping strategy that you can get help to stop.

ETA: before I get hate that I am suggesting a possibility of keeping the keys, I just figured it would be good to get therapists advice on how to destroy them or whether to return them to the victims if they think that would be a useful step in therapy."
LoveIslandTV,ffr24rf,t1_ffqgej9,1580148795.0,She might have been pissed off but at least she could have had more time to prepare backup plans. Though going last means the planning would have been pointless anyway.
LoveIslandTV,ffr1qfu,t1_ffqmy8z,1580148546.0,"Exactly! If anyone knew then Siannise probably would have been told before recoupling. 

And then Rebecca saying it’s not her fault Siannise hasn’t made connections, when she had done in some form with Connagh and Luke then lost them both to Rebecca. Though I do get what Rebecca is saying that she can still get to know Luke, but it would have been nice for some sort of heads up before recoupling. I honestly think Siannise did well not to full on kick off after that comment."
AskReddit,fdqwt3i,t3_emqd57,1578676007.0,"Doc Martens boots because they look good, are sturdy and I have flat feet so really struggle finding brands I can wear, and I can’t wear heels. I wore white docs at my wedding and I’ve got ice king docs I wear more on nights out or with a specific look. I really want some glitter ones next.

Skechers memory foam trainers, they are lightweight and really comfy. I have a plain work pair and a glittery pair I like to wear everyday. 

For games I guess I’m loyal to Nintendo, mainly animal crossing though! 

Phones: apple - I find them easy to use

Tablets: amazon kindle - cheaper and in game purchases are cheaper with amazon coins and sometimes cost less than with apple anyway. 

Amuse for plushies, bought through tofucute. Because I’m a child in an adults body."

depression,fdozz35,t3_emaxm4,1578616747.0,"I’ve been suicidal, depressed and anxious since childhood and I’m nearly 33. Thanks for giving me hope. I plan on writing all the crazy down for the psychiatrist. Currently off sick and this waiting list seems like forever. Work won’t redeploy me until I see the psychiatrist and get better. 

Finally I can have better meds than just basic depression treatment from my GP. I was debating not telling the psychiatrist I think I have autism because I was shot down twice when I brought it up in the past but your story gives me some hope. Tbh I have a massive list of conditions I think I have which makes me think maybe I’m just a hypochondriac? 

I had a difficult couple of days. Occupational health yesterday and a meeting at work with HR today. I cried the whole time and HR described me as “distressed” but I thought I was only a 2/10 on the distressed scale. Has she never seen real distress? So thanks for brightening my shitty day, and I’m so glad you feel better."

It’s not like people don’t know I’m depressed. 

But yeah suicide does pass on the pain, lost my friend last year and it sucks. I’ve promised too many people I love I won’t do that to them. Just wish people would reach out when people are depressed instead of posting that people need to speak to them. You aren’t going to reach out to an old childhood friend when you feel worthless and like a burden."

When I imagine me having a child I worry about me killing it and ending up in prison due to depression so it’s probably the wisest not to. That’s if I made it through the pregnancy without begging for an abortion. I love contraception!"

I also worry about all the other illnesses in my family. And the concept of coming off meds for pregnancy, I kinda have a phobia of pregnancy and childbirth anyway and don’t like kids. And I just imagine myself getting jailed for something stupid I could do if I got postnatal depression/psychosis. So I’m at the point now where if I’m in a good place in 10 years and change my mind I’ll adopt. 

I also worry about the world, overpopulation, global warming and I don’t want to feel like I’ve forced someone to endure the grim future we face.

You wouldn’t be the asshole for doing this, however I understand your concerns over the relationship of your children. You mentioned the other properties were split between them - would there be a way to even up the division of property?
