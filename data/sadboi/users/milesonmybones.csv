ACPocketCamp,fmr7z0w,t3_fcx82r,1586316032.0,"Hello! I started playing 4 days ago and I'm just looking to expand my friend list and to get help / help others! You can add me here : 81773627893 / username: kimmomo

CableGirlsNetflix,fm7ryk7,t1_fm2gtmr,1585835480.0,I agree with this. It felt like they were being rushed to finish the series (and I felt this way back in the ending stages of S3).
applehelp,f2tnujg,t1_f2tnru7,1570397923.0,Eh it's ok! Who knows maybe it is. The bar has started flickering HAHA I honestly have no idea anymore! But thank you so much for the help. Cheers!
applehelp,f2tndr1,t1_f2tlspd,1570397786.0,"Hmm :( I don't really feel one or see one but then again I'm not really good at these things! I'm just curious - but why is it that when I turn it off for an extended period time and back on, the problem disappears for a while? Honestly have 0 idea how these screens work but thank you for the help :) I probably won't get it fixed until it becomes a huge pain in the ass haha. Definitely should've gotten AppleCare sigh"
applehelp,f2tljlt,t1_f2tj5gv,1570397017.0,Hi! Thank you for clarifying this :) I don't see any physical problem on the screen but sigh I'll go get it checked out!! Thank you so much!!
applehelp,f2tgruy,t1_f2tgmjn,1570394901.0,Hiya! Just tried it. Sigh turns out it's a display issue :/ thank you so much for the help! I'll see if it can last till January haha. Have a good day!
Netherlands,ezqua9w,t1_ezq7epv,1568064035.0,Thanks so much! Actually my friend is hoping to go to Kop van Noord-Holland but we're in the midst of finding cheaper tickets... if you have any suggestions that would be great!! Thank you :)

depression,erzzc3h,t1_erzu62p,1561459603.0,"Thank you for this :) I've suffered with this for a very long time and I'm also no longer on meds. I think it's a bad phase right now but I'm also hoping it might get better. First ever stadium concert sounds great, I'm glad you had a good time. Exact same reason why I wanted to go off meds :) take care!"
depression,erzt5bj,t1_erzt1mt,1561450122.0,"mmm yeh I try to but honestly voice just makes me wanna cry but m too suffocated to do so sigh 

thanks thooo"
depression,ermk8v2,t1_ermk5r7,1561027083.0,Good to know that you've things that help to improve your mood! That's great. Yeah The Carpenters are really old haha and I was only born in 1997 so technically my taste in music is a little outdated :P do you listen to any punk/goth?
depression,ermjt8u,t3_c2uama,1561026479.0,"Music is always my go-to not only when I'm in a depressive state but really to help me get by day by day. I don't think I can survive without earphones or music at all. But when I'm at a low I find myself listening to the Carpenters... It has been a recent thing and I don't quite know why I connect with their music but to me there is a calming quality to it. I don't feel as anxious when I listen to them! Maybe because they remind me of a calmer time (my childhood, supposedly). Olafur Arnalds too for instrumentals when I don't want any lyrics making my brain go off-track. 

Have a good day OP!"
SuicideWatch,eqrshzp,t3_bz8f05,1560268804.0,glad for ya! have a good day you deserve it :)

AskEurope,eqc7j31,t1_eqb53t7,1559963609.0,"Thank you for explaining this! It's so different from how my own country (Singapore) does it and I'm pretty sure it's because my country's really small. Appreciate the help and I feel less anxious about the system now, thanks!"
AskEurope,eqc7ff6,t1_eqb3p83,1559963549.0,Even in Singapore they've stopped letting train drivers say their own things cause it really messes up the automated system haha
AskEurope,eqc7d4n,t1_eqasf0f,1559963510.0,Hello!! Haha no I'm not! I'm a broke student so I'm staying at an Airbnb instead :P wish it was a hotel man I wishhhh

singapore,eohq3vs,t3_brpbmw,1558588773.0,"This happened to me for a box of books I got from Book Depository... Stuffed into the letterbox, books bent, and I had to use a penknife to rip the cardboard open just so I could take the books out.

Surprisingly my mail for a couple of bills hasn't arrived (or rather did not arrive) and my family's gotten messages of overdue bills as a result. Don't even know what's happening anymore I swear."
unrealengine,eohoole,t1_eofu2qy,1558587515.0,"Hi! Thanks so much for the comment because it really cleared things up on my end. I went back to Mixamo and checked the other animations with the default model, it turns out that they're fine - it's really just this one crawling animation that's being really problematic.

I'm currently looking for a free Crawling animation I can use - I would love to use Maya but you could say I'm looking for a temporary fix :P Thanks so much for the help!"
