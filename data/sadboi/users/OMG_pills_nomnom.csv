BipolarReddit,fnsria2,t1_fnp748e,1587227414.0,"I similarly have been on many meds, particularly antipsychotics. Latuda did not control my psychotic features at all so I had to stop it right away. Geodon was too sedating for me at 160mg. Saphris controlled my psychotic features but not my depresion. Vraylar completely reversed depression but whether it controls psychotic features is yet to be seen. Still taking zyprexa, but lowered it to 20mg.

The point is that the number of meds you take and try can be frustrating but eventually with some tinkering you can definitely approach stability."
BipolarReddit,fnsp2xl,t3_g33f9d,1587226076.0,"It's very tough to say ""medication X worked for soandso, so maybe we should try that"" because people react wildly differently to these meds. Welcome to the med-go-round. Don't get discouraged, it'll take some time to find the right cocktail, but once you do, you'll start to feel better. Lower highs and higher lows, but they won't go away completely.
Lamictal doses can go as high as 400mg, and that's where it benefits me.
 I also take Zyprexa, Vraylar, Zoloft, Gabapentin, Adderall IR, and I'm supposed to be taking Inderal LA and Intunive but can't really afford those since my diabetes dx and all of the meds I now take for that.

Here's some things to remember:

1. BP2 tends to lead with depressive episodes moreso than hypomanic episodes.
2. The med cocktail takes time.
3. You should have a pdoc you can trust who will let you have a discussion about what they want to put you on rather than just throwing meds at you. In other words, at the very least, a discussion of the pros and cons of a medication and some potential alternatives.

zyprexa made me gain weight and ultimately gave me diabetes but i was on a very high dose, higher than the FDA recommends/approved. But it really stopped psychotic features dead in their tracks.

Vraylar wasn't sedating, but made me feel very calm. It is the single most effective thing I have ever taken to relieve my depression. If I was going to recommend you asking about a single med, it would be this one. Keep in mind it's expensive but worth it if you can swing it."

Not only that, their sound is completely their own and you know an immolation riff when you hear it. A great example of this is ""the purge"" off of *Majesty and Decay.* The first track on *Atonement* is also a good example of this. That said, I would strongly recommend starting with *Dawn of Possession* and listen to their albums in order.

There's no generic, although I'm sure you can get a coupon card from the Latuda website and a lot of the time those coupon cards are pretty great. 

Sorry to hear what you're going through. I cannot imagine how difficult it must be dealing with your symptoms *plus* a new child. I'm not a parent (and never will be) but I've had my share of mixed episodes. My recommendation is to try the Latuda. In clinical studies, Abilify was not shown to be effective for depressive episodes, although it can be used to augment antidepressants. That said, Latuda *is* indicated for depressive/mixed episodes and you're (probably) most likely to get a benefit from the Latuda.
