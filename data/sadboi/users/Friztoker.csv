So, even if you don't know them personally, I don't think it's weird to maybe be inspired by them and maybe form some kind of personal respect for them as people, just like you would a good friend that you look up to...?"

So basically, afraid of living poorly more than of dying, I think. And death can come suddenly, not giving much time to realize your desperation to live a more authentic and present life. Well I guess that's not true, death has been coming since birth, for decades, so that may be a weak excuse..."

aspergers,fgmcgkw,t3_ey7zv6,1580921925.0,"I listen to podcasts all the time. You could search and there's plenty, plenty of them regarding mindfulness and related practices, but I'll put in my favourites:
Be Here Now Network (and therein especially Jack Kornfield's 'Heart Wisdom' and 'Mindrolling')
Audio Dharma
And like I said, there is PLENTY of them if you just search.

Edit: There are also more secular ones, if you f.x. search 'secular mindfulness', etc. Someone mentioned Sam Harris, he's got a podcast to, although I keep away from it. Also, Tim Ferriss has a pretty cool poscast, I'd say, as well as Duncan Trussell. For me, when it comes down to it though, is not to overload on resources because mindfulness is in the end a pretty basic practice.

I wonder though, if someone here has any insight on that: Should aspies approach this mindfulness differently than normal?"
