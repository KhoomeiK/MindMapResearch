FemaleDatingStrategy,fef579q,t3_eosm1o,1579048452.0,"Thank you for this, I need to hear it. Been exhausting myself the past 2 months bugging my new bf to eat more than pizza all day and sleep before 4am when he has work at 8am and regularly sleeps through his alarms. I’m tired of being the “nagging mom” or “wife” trope and it’s 2 months in."
Trufemcels,fef3wed,t1_feeiew1,1579047575.0,I understand what you are trying to say. She was the motivator behind the spending. Idk why people are misunderstanding. Using the word “cause” means a certain event or incident can be responsible for an “effect” which was the overspending. I understand what you were saying don’t worry!
GenderCritical,fef3lr1,t1_fed5zgr,1579047377.0,THIS. I’ve heard men be graphic about their dicks and masturbation since like the 5th grade and recently one of my female friends made a joke about her “pussy being wet” and this guy was like “Ew gross tmi.” LIKE I HAVEN’T BEEN FORCED TO HEAR your disgusting masturbation and dick stories for years???? Just the existence of female pleasure grosses you out? Got it
Trufemcels,fef0gz2,t1_feebbje,1579045288.0,"I wanna give you such a big hug right now, eerily these stories reflect a lot of interactions I had in my highschool days, extremely similar treatment from customer service people and food service employees. I was the only female in my graduating class without a prom date and hid in the bathroom crying while everyone took the couple photos. Out of like 70+ other girls, I was the only one alone. I’m so sorry that memory is so horrible for you. I too, avoid thinking of prom as it just wasn’t a positive experience. Just know, the people who think back to prom as the “best night of their lives” lack substance and peaked during those years."
PornFreeRelationships,feerwp7,t1_feefmdo,1579039902.0,LOL I totally agree with this
PinkpillFeminism,feeq4yl,t3_eonogz,1579038856.0,Any people with experience in neurobiology to explain this? breaks my heart to think men are completely incapable of loving connections
BipolarReddit,feepr3t,t3_enig2h,1579038635.0,"This isn’t a problem in Canada, right?"
PornFreeRelationships,fd47etx,t3_ejwpcg,1578165034.0,This is actually incredibly interesting to think about and an excellent point. I do believe it has something to do with women being socialized to be 100% submissive whereas men are encouraged to have as many sexual partners as possible.
PornFreeRelationships,fd44ygr,t1_fd2cctf,1578164497.0,Ok this made me laugh HAHA omg thank u for this😂😂
PornFreeRelationships,fd44h0c,t1_fd2yi3z,1578164354.0,"Thank you for asking for further context, you definitely are right, from my experience, that men are usually more accepting of mental health symptoms if they’ve experienced themselves. I appreciate your intentions to prevent me from blaming myself! Thank you for your response I genuinely appreciate it"
PornFreeRelationships,fd4383y,t1_fd2b949,1578163976.0,"He isn’t on any medications, I truly believe he would be honest with me if he was because we’ve talked about medications and mental health history before. we’ve spent multiple days together he sees me take my medication and he never takes anything, I’ve had to go into his bag to look for stuff (when he’s asked me to) and he never brings any pills or medication with him when he stays so I’m 100% positive he’s not on any medication. Thank you so much for your response! It’s incredibly helpful to know that these things happen to men on SSRIS."
BPD,f8vw9dk,t3_e2dcd8,1574878511.0,It sounds like a lot of this is stemming from their insecurities tbh
BPD,f86enfb,t1_f86ego1,1574296252.0,"This response was so incredibly helpful and validating! Thank you so so much for taking time out of your day to respond, I appreciate it so so much!❤️"
