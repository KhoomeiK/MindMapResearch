I am looking at your issue from the outside-in, and a massive, massive, silverlining that I can see is that you are not settling for someone you know you aren't happy with. Sure, it's been several  years since a serious relationship, but I would much rather wait a bit than be in a marriage that is insincere. Honestly, I'd say that is more of a blessing than a curse.

You seem to be focusing on a lot of things in your life right now that are geared towards items that are interesting to you (e.g. working towards IT) and I feel that will be a fantastic opportunity for you to meet someone who you will share genuine interest in.

Be proud of yourself for not rushing. Sure, you are 30. But, honestly, what good is being married if you are not committed and into it? Be a bit more patient. Possibly get involved in a club or a hobby in which you socialize. I think you will be amazed at how things can, both quickly and unexpectedly, fall into your lap.

Best of luck and take care of yourself. Be proud of yourself and respect yourself!"

I am so sorry to read this. My condolences for your poor kitty.

Firstly, you definitely need to call the police to at least report this behavior. This may be uncomfortable to talk through it and unfortunately, it is too late for your poor kitty. It is not a good sign, and at least putting the activity on the radar for the authorities would be a huge step in the right direction. Also, like /u/roseta-lolet mentioned, it wouldn't hurt looking into getting a gun and training on how to use it. God forbid anything else happens like this and your husband isn't close by or the perpetrator wants to take it a step further.

This is a  very confusing situation, and more-than-likely foul play was involved. The type of person that would do this activity (as we believe it happened) is a very, very, sick person with issues. That person is not well and, frankly, I feel sorry for them in a way. I could not imagine being in the state of mind, low enough, or so far gone to where I would think it about doing this to an animal, let alone an obvious pet. Again, please contact the authorities.

I will pet and hold my dog extra tonight in honor of your kitty. I am so, so,sorry to read this. Please do not hesitate to message me if you want to talk or even just to vent."

In my opinion and from my own experience with other topics, the largest contributor in climate denial is the way people go about expressing it. People don't want to be called dumb or stupid because they don't believe in something. Being called dumb and stupid is an immediate loss for the person trying to convince climate deniers (if they were truly trying to convince in the first place) that they are wrong and there really is something going on. With that said, there will always be people who just won't budge.

When the 1080 Ti first came out, I decided to buy it and have loved it ever since.
