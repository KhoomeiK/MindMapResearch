TeenageSuicideWatch,etyo1ah,t3_ce0yut,1563320448.0,Hey. Your friend are wrong! Death is not an option. If you wanna talk please send me a text
EatingDisorders,etymx2x,t3_cc4jdm,1563320047.0,"She needs medical help for sure and I know how hard it will be to convince her cause we associaste it with getting fat. Excessive gym can also be a form of anorexia. 

Therapy and drugs can be help a lot, it helped me.

I cannot help you a lot on terms of telling her to eat, cause I am not even in recovering and I relapse very so often. But for sure don’t pressure her, you can make her feel
Very uncomfortable. I had a friend who tried to do this and instead it made me angry and I avoided her on situations that involved food.

I needed a bit scare to the hospital to be less obsessive with my weight, but I a still on the path to recovery. 

Be honest.
Show you care and that it scares you, and help her to find help. And believe me she has to want to find help. So maybe try to make her see that."
EatingDisorders,etylm48,t3_cc4jdm,1563319586.0,"Approach anyone else would in my point of view a last resource. She might take very badly and not opened up with you again about it for being scared of what you might tell other people. I am very ashamed of my ED and only a few people knows about it. I recovered from bulimia but I have anorexia. And later I developed self
Harm cause I didn’t felt that bulimia was a enough self punishment. It can develop to other types of mental health issues and she might need to able to trust someone. 

Express your concern in a very nice way but don’t push it too hard cause you could create a very anxious situation. She might jus try to hide from you the fact that she stills dealing with ED."
EatingDisorders,etykbs9,t3_cdv3eh,1563319135.0,Has he opened up with you about this specific issue ?
depression,etyjrbj,t3_cdxapr,1563318933.0,Same here.
EatingDisorders,etvgpgy,t1_ess8207,1563234941.0,"Once a got a food scale I got obsessive and I can not eat if I don’t weight my food. 
To be honest scales in general are bad. Body scale is bad because even though when we achieve. Point we wanted we gonna want to punch even further and further, because we cannot see us as thin."
EatingDisorders,etvg9zn,t3_ca6k2b,1563234627.0,Dont make silly jokes on how things can make her fat. We know it’s a joke but deep down it seems like it’s true
EatingDisorders,etvfs4g,t3_cdhmt2,1563234250.0,"Dont give up!!!  Somedays gonna be hard. My husband tried stopping me from a bulimia crisis and I lashed at him, I got angry, I cried, I felt desperate. And he kept pushing me out of the bathroom. At the end we hugged and he waited to me make sure it passed.  Just show your there.

Please don’t force her to eating like right away,
Start with baby steps. Incentive but not too hard.
It can create a lot of anxiety."
selfharm,etvf8hx,t3_cdo21c,1563233836.0,"Tell the truth. My husband helps a lot with it. He sometimes take thing I can cut myself with away. The last time he put me in his position and told me if I was going to do it again he would do to himself and that’s when I cracked and cried a lot. 
I have eating disorders and he tries to make me feel comfortable as much as possible. Don’t be scared about talking to other people about. I was scared people would think I was doing for attention. But only good came up after I talked to my husband."
selfharm,etvet8u,t3_cdnd7o,1563233517.0,"One person asked me a question about what’s worse about having depression, eating disorders and panic attacks. And the only thing I could answer is how people doesn’t understand how simple words can cause a big impact"
