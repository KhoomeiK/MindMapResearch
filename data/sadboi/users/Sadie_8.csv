Anxiety,fo8qop8,t3_g66te9,1587601871.0,"I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way. I have to say I’ve had similar thoughts. Isolating completely alone and I’m realizing if normal doesn’t come until we have a vaccine, I’m potentially missing prime years to date and find my person. I think this is especially hard because I’ve been wanting to find my person before this and this just amplified the desire and the loneliness. 

Have you considered online dating? Even if you can’t meet up you may find a special connection that gets you through. 

I have said before all of this that being single wouldn’t feel so bad if I knew in x amount of months I’d meet my person. I could enjoy the last time in my life that I’ll be single but the anxiety of not knowing whether you’ll ever find someone would be gone. I’m trying to reframe my thinking that this can be that time - the last alone time before we’re all back to normal and craving relationships and finding each other. Maybe this will change the online dating culture. Who knows. 

Hang in there. We’re alone together."

BruceSpringsteen,fnsu1er,t3_dxi351,1587228785.0,"Another of my favorites:

“Sometimes you’ve been too beat up or haven’t healed enough of the fear out of you to know a good thing when you’ve found it. Sometimes you just gravitate towards the pain, it’s what you’re used to, it’s how you recognize yourself. It feels like home. It feels more familiar to you than love. So that’s where you go. 

You don’t know how to hold onto love, but you know how to hold onto hurt.”"
BruceSpringsteen,fnss6ap,t3_dxi351,1587227780.0,"“This idea that we all have our broken pieces. What frightens and what exhilarates and inspires us are often very close together. Those feelings are the essence of what drives us to risk - in life and in love. Everybody’s broken in someway - physically, emotionally, spiritually - in this life no one gets away unhurt. 

I wrote a song about a guy not just finding the fearlessness to do his job but the fearlessness to be with somebody you love. 

We’re always trying to find somebody whose broken pieces fit with our broken pieces and something whole emerges.”

And from the song: “figured maybe together we could get the broken pieces to fit.”"
