People have different reasons for being suicidal. As for me, I have the same question as you: WHY?! I don't understand it, and it makes it even harder to deal with. As best as science can explain, there's something wrong with my brain chemicals, or neurotransmitters, or maybe my gut microbiome, but no one really knows. Objectively, I have pretty much all I need in life. But still my brain makes me anxious and depressed.

It's like ALWAYS being in a situation that makes you uncomfortable. Or like having a cold ALL the time. No matter what you do, no matter what's going on, no matter who or what you have in your life, you feel like crap. Maybe there are things that make you feel better temporarily, but they don't outweigh how badly you're feeling. Or maybe like me most things have lost any positive emotional responses. And on top of it all, you can't pinpoint the reason, which means you can't change it. I feel like if I'm not actively concentrating on something (which is harder and harder to do), I just have this constant running thought of, ""How do I fix my life? How can I change this? Will it ever get any better? Am I going to feel this way forever?"" 

At times, I truly feel stuck, like there is no escape from feeling miserable all of the time. And since I know there are things in my life that are (supposed to be) good, I feel guilty on top of it all.

Since you've tried so many medications, you're probably a good candidate for TMS, if your insurance covers it. I just finished my last treatment today.

I haven't tried ketamine (yet?) because from what my doctors say, they usually want to try TMS first before ketamine.

But just because you get engaged doesn't mean you have to get married immediately! You're in a serious relationship and you both sound like you're on the same page, so why not make it official?"
depression,f7ljzuk,t3_dwu3dn,1573842121.0,"I smoke every day - after work on weekdays and after I get whatever done outside the house on weekends (if I leave at all). I find it to be one of the few things that give me relief. I have both anxiety and depression, and I know that some strains can make anxiety worse, but for most of the strains I've smoked, I feel way better. It just lifts a weight off me. I can relax and laugh again. Sometimes I get really introspective, sort of stuck in my own head, but in a productive way - like I understand myself better. Things make more sense when I smoke. It also used to really help my sex drive, although lately even that doesn't seem to help.

I know it's believed to have long-term effects that apparently mess with dopamine regulation or something, but the immediate effects outweigh that risk for me. Plus I haven't read anything definitive or truly convincing."
depression,f7le5fz,t3_dwfcja,1573838520.0,"OP, your situation is a little similar to mine, only I'm the depressed wife. I just had a similar conversation with my husband last night and he was getting really frustrated. I can't say for sure if your wife feels this way, but here is my take on the experience:

Sometimes I want someone to understand and validate my perception of reality - my *subjective* emotions and interpretations of things. I realize that this is often at complete odds with the *objective reality*, but in the moment I just want to know that someone understands what I'm experiencing and can appreciate how much it sucks. 

Your wife might be feeling defensive because you're denying what she *perceives* to be true. She might feel like she's being told that her own lived experience is invalid. The objective truth is probably very different from how she feels. But the way it makes her feel is very real to her. That makes it difficult to accept that her perception doesn't match reality. It also makes it almost inconsequential that it doesn't match reality, because the real problem is how she's feeling, not what you can see to be objectively true. It's hard to articulate, but I would put it this way (my POV): ""Does it really matter if it's true or not? I'm still miserable regardless!""

I realize that doesn't really help, because how do you make her feel better when it's not even rooted in reality? But I think if, like other comments said, you (+ your therapist) can help her logically examine the truths of reality (""What happened to make you think that?""), she might be able to trump her emotions with her logic. It's really hard to do (I know from experience) and it's more like cultivating a habit than a quick fix.

P.S. You sound like a really loving and supportive husband and it sounds like you're doing a really good job already. I can appreciate how incredibly frustrating this is."
depression,f7ira7o,t3_dwb87j,1573764251.0,"Agree! Even worse when I'm hearing/reading about all the great work other people are doing, how accomplished they are, when I hate what I do and can barely concentrate, and my work has almost no impact.

AdultDepression,f6mvx6f,t3_dry4to,1572980043.0,"I hope you get some good news about your kitten.

Can you talk to your therapist about what you're experiencing with the candy? At least you won't have to wait until you see your psychiatrist. As for the candy, you could try giving it away at work (making other people happy can make you feel better) or keeping it in an obnoxious place that's hard to get to. But the bigger issue of why you turn to sugar when you're depressed would be a good thing to talk about with your therapist. What are you thinking and feeling when you start eating candy? Is it purely a craving?

I don't think you could have done any serious physical damage in only a month. But try to remember how crappy you're feeling when you get another craving. You know it won't make you feel better. And try to make sure you're eating proper meals so that low blood sugar doesn't drive you to make bad choices."

depression,f5x1070,t3_dpl4bu,1572533730.0,"Same here, only in my deepest depression I can no longer maintain the facade. So I'm visibly glum, struggling to concentrate at work, unable to keep up appearances, and on the verge of breaking down publicly, but am still forcing myself to go to work and be relatively high functioning. 

Basically, I can't afford to be non-functional. I wouldn't get out of bed if I didn't have to. I know it's fucked up, but in a way I'm kind of jealous of people who are non-functional because that's how I feel but I have to maintain the horrible routine."
AdultDepression,f4v249m,t3_dlvo2d,1571835162.0,"Agree so hard. I started journaling to track my mood while doing TMS and flipped back to old entries spanning the last 8 years of my life...in each one I described being very depressed. It just reminded me that even when I thought a certain period of my life was better, I was still depressed. It always comes back.

Sorry to hear you also struggle with this. I hope something changes for us, or at least makes the temporary solutions last a little bit longer each time."

depression,f411xjk,t3_dj2k88,1571313003.0,"I think you could keep it pretty simple and just come out and say it. ""Mom, I'm depressed, and I need help."" I think asking for help is important, because even if your mom doesn't understand the way you're feeling, she can still take action (setting up an appointment with a therapist or psychiatrist) and it shows that you want to fix the problem. As you said, something has to change. You don't necessarily need to know how to explain it to her (that's what the professional is for), she just needs to know that her child needs her help. Good luck!"

depression,f410y4c,t1_f3z41aq,1571312412.0,"Thank you. I'll most likely post more about TMS either way. I've had 17 sessions out of 36 so far, and they say most people don't notice effects until about session # 20-25. Up to now I think it has moved my baseline mood up very slightly, but I'm hoping I will feel more profound effects soon.

This line of thinking about suicide is so warped and I hope it doesn't undermine my treatment, but when things are bad, it just makes sense to me because I feel like I need to do *something*, and I need it as an option.

I hope you find some relief soon, whether it's TMS or something else."
depression,f3b1vlb,t1_f3a4zas,1570799329.0,"A couple things you said really hit home for me.

> I blame myself for being too weak to suck it up and live but I even forgot how to live. I can’t describe it except that I just don’t know how to live anymore. 

Yes! It's like I wasn't made for this world, I just can't handle even the most mundane parts of life. And I feel pathetic about it.

>... can’t help but to think my end is near. I feel like I was destined to commit suicide. 

Agree, it's like suicide is inevitable. I have this feeling of certainty that I am going to die soon, to the point where I second-guess buying things I'm running out of because I think, ""What's the point, I'm going to be dead anyway...""

I'm in the middle of TMS therapy and I feel like I'm undermining any possible recovery by thinking this way, but I just can't shake the conviction that I'm going to die by suicide, and soon."
AdultDepression,f3819o2,t3_de7fpa,1570732484.0,"Good question. I wish I could pinpoint the root cause. No trauma that I can recall. My parents divorced when I was 9, but I don't recall anything about how I reacted to it. (I don't have many memories of my childhood other than specific flashbulb memories.) Maybe if you hypnotized me you'd find some trauma I'm blocking out, but as it is, I wish I knew. If it's true that I don't have a particular event, then I'm just one of those unlucky people whose brain just sucks at regulating my moods. To make things more complicated, I tend not to remember very depressing periods of my life, so it could be that I'm blocking something out, or it could be that I've just always been depressed, even that young. I wish I knew.

But as someone else said, work also gets me really down. But to me, that's a situational depression versus (or in my case, on top of) endogenous/biochemical depression. I really want to know what causes the latter.

Edit: What about you, OP? What makes you ask?"
