There are a few reasons for it, I personally suffer with it because of low iron levels and so supplements help it clear up. It can also be because of saliva gathering at the sides of the mouth."
SkincareAddiction,fi1qrzf,t1_fi0rz1x,1582062944.0,I find cerave great for everyday use and I think it prevents my skin from becoming dry and inflamed but not great to actually heal or calm eczema. La Roche Posey do some great creams that really helps clear up eczema. They have a solid stick which stops itching which is worth trying.

If nothing else, it’s helps me catch my breath and slow my body down."

DecidingToBeBetter,f0sr2hr,t1_f0s7o5i,1568909286.0,Carrying a book wherever you go is great advice. I often end up on my phone just because I’m bored so will definitely try this!
Empaths,f0ozj8i,t3_d5zg44,1568823815.0,"I understand what you mean. I’m an empath but even more so a HSP. I once read about HSPs going shopping and mulling over meat each time they buy it, thinking how it came to be there and what the animal went though and whether they’re okay with eating it on that particular day. I can relate to it so much. 

I’m both a meat eater and animal lover (with a degree in animal science!); someone who really enjoys eating meat but struggles with the concept of it. It’s a hard one and I’m too sure where I stand tbh. I can imagine becoming a vegetarian at some point in the future to save me wrestling with my conscience!"
Anxiety,f0o4dos,t1_f0n401q,1568794515.0,I completely agree! It can affect the body is so many different ways. I had a few days of terrible anxiety earlier this week and now have swollen lymph nodes and a sore throat which I presume is because of all the stress my body went through

Anxiety,f0iwy4z,t3_d51k1w,1568648084.0,"YES, you’ve got to put your health first. 

For today just go home and concentrate on feeling better.

Tomorrow, get in touch with your college and explain that you are struggling at the moment. Most colleges/6th forms/universities have something in place for students that need extra support.

I’ve just finished my masters and my university were great. I didn’t tell them for the first four months and tried to deal with it myself. I got to the point where I needed help and registered with student services as having anxiety. They confirmed this with my doctor and then discussed it with my department who gave me extensions on my essays. They were incredibly helpful. 

Hope things work out for you :)"
selfimprovement,f0fjehi,t3_d4nkr6,1568584309.0,You need to make it habit. I do different workouts (CrossFit/running/gym classes etc) every week day evening and it’s just a habit now.

selfimprovement,ezqw04d,t3_d1s3od,1568064629.0,"I ended up studying marine biology at uni because I had a slight interest in it and was good at bio. During those days a housemate of mine studied politics (which I had NO interest in at the time). She’d come home and tell me what her lectures were about (not just politics but current affairs and things going on around the world) and I got more and more interested in the subject. I started researching online, reading library books, watching documentaries.

Fast forward seven years, and I now have six years of experience as well as a masters in international development and it’s my favourite thing in the world.

My point is, you never know what’s going to happen in life. If you’d have asked me back then what I’d be doing in the future I’d have had no clue. I remember worrying about not knowing what I wanted to do like you are. 

Maybe have a think about what you’ve always been interested in and visit a library to read around the subject. You say you like playing video games, what about being a software developer? That might be something to look into. 

But I also think you should look for another job whilst you are working now. Doesn’t have to be your dream job but just something you can at least enjoy or be challenged by. If you do end up figuring out what kind of thing you want to do long term, then you could look for a job which would help you on the path to it. 

Wishing you the best :)"

Personally, i have an anxiety disorder and the first time I successfully meditated (fyi, it took me a while to get the hang of it), I was astounded by the feeling of calm I got. Even if it’s only two minutes a day where you switch off and focus on the present moment, I’d say give it a shot."

Use an app to help and buy some cheap weighing scales. Don’t aim to start perfect but aim to count everything and over time you can make sure you’re eating the right amount. Best of luck!"
flexibility,eyug63w,t3_cyrgyu,1567461284.0,"I have been lifting consistently for a year now. For the first eight months I did no mobility or flexibility work and, in contrast, have included several sessions a week over the past four months. I can see a huge difference. 

Whilst I can’t comment on injury prevention because I’ve never really had one, my ROM whilst lifting has improved and I’m more comfortable getting into certain positions such as squatting. Aside from doing it to benefit your lifting, I would highly recommend incorporating mobility and flexibility training just to feel better in yourself and not so stiff all the time."
selfimprovement,eyrqtpw,t3_cydbxm,1567375747.0,"Hi, first-time Reddit poster here :) A few bits of advice: 

1. Start with TINY changes. I once read that if your goal is to floss everyday, set a daily goal to floss just one tooth. Chances are, once you’ve flossed one you’ll carry on but even if you don’t it will become part of your daily routine. For you this could mean 10 mins of exercise every morning, chances are you’ll do more but if you don’t you have still done something towards your goal. 

2. Link the changes you want to make to your current routine. For example if you wanted to do squats everyday, do them whilst you brush your teeth, whilst you wait for the shower to warm up etc; read your class notes whilst you eat breakfast; go straight to the gym on your way home. 

3. Get a habit tracker and tick things off each day. It’s satisfying and keeps you motivated. 

4. Get a notebook and write WHY you want to achieve each goal. Refer to this when you feel unmotivated. Break each goal down into steps and decide what the first three steps are for each. Also write what it will look like when you achieve that goal, and maybe even plan a reward for when you do. 

5. Get a yearly calendar and spread you goals out. You want to add and change things bit by bit, not all at once. The key is creating good habits and building on them.

6. It’s not about perfection, it’s about making tiny steps towards where you want to be every single day. 

Hope this helps a little and good luck!"
