depression,fhqn23m,t3_f4ayvb,1581806945.0,I think u need to be more aggressive not just sending resumes u need to and ask about the job or ring up or make an appointment to see the boss or head of HR department something like 70% of jobs are already promised to sons daughters nieces and nephews they are only advertised because some companies have it in the rules that it has to be posted but if I was the boss an some guy impressed me enough that I thought he will make my life easier or make me money I’d say screw my regional managers 2nd cousin and hire the guy who went to the effort of fighting for the job
depression,fhqkros,t3_f4fzbt,1581805961.0,"My advice (u don’t have to take it though as my own life is a mess)
1. Put a full stop in ur family if they want u in their lives they have To change relationships are about middle grounds
2. Same goes for ur in laws if ur fiancé loves u the previous advice applies to them too
3. About ur job keep looking for new jobs all the time even if u are in a job ur content with doing ur perfect job could be in the advertisements in the paper today and always be upskilling ur current skills or learning new ones doesn’t have to be a long course could be a 2 hr class once a week
4. About friends u better try to make friends and doing a class will help that just remember that everyone has something that annoys other people just like u probably do it up to u to look for the positive in people and not the negative 
5 about ur knee and being fat Thaler up swimming it low impact and u could use that to meet new people
6 someplace to live u could look into buying his uncles house of the uncle if the uncle lives elsewhere most of the time and if u can strike a deal u actually save money cutting out real estate agents and so on 
7. About money just save what u can when u can in an account u can’t access on the spur of the moment and don’t buy crap u don’t need what I do is if I want something I don’t buy it for a week after that if I still want it I consider buying it
8. Sex isn’t everything in a relationship but maybe ur fiancé has fantasies that he feels uncomfortable bring up the two of u just need to talk and be honest with each other and not with random weirdos on Reddit 😋
That would be me by the way"

FamiliesYouChoose,fhhxcap,t3_f30kiq,1581613606.0,37 m currently looking for someone to talk to about depression as I think I am suffering from it at the moment can’t talk to anyone here due to the stigma about it in this country and I have had social anxiety for around 20 yrs cut off all contact with every on I knew back then and still don’t talk to them even though I would love to I don’t know about being a adopted family member to you though as family usually screw you over but if u need advice or someone to talk to I can listen and give you brutal honesty in return which is in my opinion sorely lacking in the world at the moment
AskReddit,fgnbwro,t3_ezauxv,1580941627.0,All depends is it a street fight or a competition fight if it’s a competition then see if u can see any videos of their previous fights and turn their weaknesses into ur strengths and if it’s a street fight who cares what anyone thinks winning is winning by that I mean go for their tenders (at ur own risk ) that is balls throat eyes anyway to win basically people will judge you but winning is winning
