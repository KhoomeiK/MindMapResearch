infp,fqwkuoz,t1_fqwg91p,1589708164.0,"Well there isn’t actually much restraint going on with the drinking. I’m stuck in a religious house and I’m very anti social and awkward and hate myself in public generally, so there’s likely never going to come a time where I can drink underage. I don’t think I ever will start drinking, I get addicted quite easily to things that I can turn into a coping mechanism. 

I never knew about the personality types until a few years ago, but I think I’ve actually always been an INFP looking back. I was always very imaginative and wanting to “keep the peace,” I always thought deeply and felt deeply as well. I’ve never really been extroverted or fully engaged in reality. That’s another thing I fail at as an INFP actually, I can’t really bring two sides together. I can see where both parties are coming from, that part’s no problem, but thanks to the social anxiety/anti social lifestyle I have little to no skills interacting with people. I dropped out of high school like two years ago now, but my mom somehow found a local program to het high school drop outs their diplomas so I did that and literally finished in a month, that was in February of this year. Other than that month of doing that program, I’ve literally been that lazy, useless child who just stays home all day watching YouTube and playing video games, so I feel like I’m a couple steps back from where everyone my age else is at. I’ve made zero attempts to try and understand my mind or the emotions and thoughts I have. Maybe I will do it when I get older like you, but at the moment I just know I experience too many thoughts and emotions. Everything just feels jumbled up and clogged, or to go along with your analogy, I’ve got a bunch of pop ups and malware in my system. It’s tough changing from wanting to delete my system entirely to trying to do the “reboot” thing and try and turn things around. I feel like I’m in survival mode right now. No time for enjoying life or having friends or doing any normal people things. I guess it’s just what happens when you spend an entire year sitting at home alone with no human interaction, just thinking about suicide and being stuck in the thick cloud of depression. What sucks the most about this is that there’s no guarantee it will get easier or better, maybe this is just something I’m going to have to manage for the rest of my life. I’m hesitant to say I’m permanently scared or hurt, because that always brings on the “you’re just young and naive” type comments. I hate when people say that, it just totally invalidates and dismisses any real problems going on. You can be eighteen and actually heartbroken or dead inside just like any thirty year old can. Life isn’t the same or equal to everyone. 

Anyway..I don’t really know what I’m talking about anymore either. It’s 5:30 am and I haven’t slept yet, I’ve just been on reddit the entire night. I don’t even feel tired. Today might be a day where I sleep half of it away..."

Ideally I’d like to act in the manner you’ve been speaking, but I’ve really let myself slip due to depression and a lack of love for life. I’m kind of a general dick around my family and am always grumpy. Bottling everything up and having no one to talk does me no good either. I wish I could be like other INFPs who can show kindness and love even if they’re really down in it. I get very agitated and lash out when I’m having a rough time, guess I’m a prime example of an unhealthy INFP. It’s funny, I just realized that when people say INFPs are idealistic and are passionate and stick to what they believe, everyone assumes it’s for the good of everyone, but then there are some dickhead INFPs like me who are idealistic and hold tight to beliefs that only serve me. I do show a lot of empathy and want to help others, but I’m discovering more and more lately that I’m not a very loving or caring INFP. I *want* to be, but that doesn’t mean I am. And then this adds to my shame and self hatred, feeling the crushing weight of that expectancy that I hold myself to. In my head I’m super compassionate and understanding, but I have yet to actually live that out in reality."

I’m not sure how it happened, but I think I somehow distorted my perspective of INFP:, thinking that all the unhealthy INFPs is what normal INFPs function like. I forget quite easily that you can be any of the types and be perfectly healthy and live a normal life. Maybe this is why I was initially stressed out and upset over being an INFP, I looked to see if there was a sub for this stuff and after reading through a few of the posts I started hating myself, thinking that I was the same as a lot of the “willing wallowers” as you put it. Depression has made it hard, but I’ve always hated the mindset of hopelessness and giving in. That’s not to say I look down on others or think I’m so great or anything, it’s just a standard I set for myself and if I don’t live by it then all the self hate thoughts come raining down.

I definitely use it to cope with certain things, but it’s not like it’s the reason it started, I think. I was really young and life was almost perfect at that age, so who knows why I did it.

MaladaptiveDreaming,fqbre9f,t1_fqbox35,1589242452.0,"No not necessarily, other than DILD. The only reason I can still get lucid somewhat regularly is because when I started at first I went hardcore, I was obsessed with it (still am technically). I did the usual stuff, reality checks, dream journaling, daily meditation (this one is undervalued by many), and I did use MILD a little bit for a few months. Also at one point I tried all day awareness. Two years ago I started practicing and getting a little better at WILD, but I still can’t do that whenever I want. In my opinion, to really get into lucid dreaming, life has to be pretty calm, little or no external stresses and obligations that take up much of your time, little or no mental health issues, things should generally be pretty good. When I started lucid dreaming everything was okay in my life, compared to now, then I probably would’ve disagreed that life was great but it was. 

Even with all that, lucid dreaming is entirely subjective, what I did doesn’t really matter, certain techniques work better for certain people for whatever reason. You just have to try a bunch of techniques until you find one that works well for you, or good enough. And tons of motivation, without that you won’t get anywhere.

LucidDreaming,fq846uq,t3_ghd6nz,1589158151.0,"There’s a potential it could, for sure, but maybe not to the degree you’d expect. Just simply having a thought doesn’t necessarily make it happen in the dream, at least in my experience. You need to fully expect and believe it will happen. So I suppose if you have an intrusive thought and are super scared it will happen, it might happen, though not always. Otherwise you’ll most likely be totally fine. 

With all of that said, meditation helps immensely with a noisy mind, and if you’re serious about lucid dreaming you’ll take up daily meditation. A few weeks of meditation and you’ll be surprised how much control you have over your thought, and by the time you’re lucid dreaming on the regular you’ll be great at meditation, and deciding which thought you want to focus on."

The thing about reality checks is that you can get creative with them, you don’t have to follow the standard. Just think, what can you do in a lucid dream that you can’t do in reality? Whatever you can think of, boom that’s a reality check you can use. The only things I can think of other than reading or checking the time (which I’d throw out anyway, you actually **can** read in dreams, you do in your non lucid dream right, so what’s the diff when you get lucid?) are maybe trying to phase through a wall or table, or maybe try and spawn something (though as a beginner there is a big chance you’ll be in a dream and try to spawn something but fail because you haven’t had the proper amount of practice), or maybe just look for any inconsistencies. There’s a couple questions you can ask yourself, where are you, how did you get here/can you remember what happened before this very moment? Basically just question your general reality, think about what’s going on around you. 

I hope this helps you some, I understand that reality checks aren’t always conducive to public spaces. Just remember what I said at the beginning, try getting a little creative. You don’t have to follow what everyone else suggests or does."

Talking about dreams is interesting, I never really tell beginners about this but I can see where you’re coming from with it. For me personally there doesn’t seem to be too much of an impact whether I talk about my dreams with others or not, but I can still see (because of your explanation) how it does for others. The only reason why I don’t talk my dreams much is because the right time never seems to pop up. It seems kind of forced whenever I want to bring up my dreams, so I just let it go most of the time, especially because whenever I tell someone an interesting dream I had, they without fail will respond flatly with something like “oh, that’s so weird,” and then I feel stupid and realize of course they wouldn’t be as moved by my dream as I was, because I experienced it and they didn’t. But that’s my personal experience, and why I stopped sharing my dreams as much. Certainly wouldn’t stand in the way of anyone else sharing their dreams though. 

Curious as to what possibilities may be opened if we loosen our perception of reality. What happens in our dreams is subjective and separate from reality, so I’m not sure what connection there could be."
LucidDreaming,fq18bau,t1_fq16gpv,1589043143.0,"It really is. Especially because when you’re a beginner you’re getting bombarded with all kinds of information and many people telling you many different things, like which is the best technique and what you supposed can or cannot do in a lucid dream. I try my best to tell beginners to do lots of research from multiple sources (should be common sense by now but just in case it isn’t). A lot of people who makes tutorials or videos might unintentionally bring their biases into it, like when they say “this method is the best” or “this dream control technique is the easiest,” because we both know what they really mean is that it was the easiest and most successful for them, not the person reading the article or watching the video. I feel like this is a pretty big deal, so again it’s why I always try to make beginners aware of this. The beliefs and ideas we pick up on while awake in reality can and will influence and change our experience in the lucid dream state."
SuicideWatch,fpzlhdn,t3_gg7gjy,1589019863.0,I’m not. I’d love to have one right about now...actually a year ago would’ve been better.
LucidDreaming,fpx0b5t,t3_gg1i2b,1588973251.0,"Yep it’s very important for beginners to know this. There are many posts saying that they’ve never lucid dreamt before, and then go on to explain how they’ve had a dream where they did a reality check *and realized they were dreaming*. People seem to think you need a certain level of control and length in order for it to be a lucid dream. You can have a lucid dream that lasts literally one second or a dream where you can’t do anything, it’s still a lucid dream. You’ve realized you’re aware inside of the dream while dreaming. 

I think this misconception happens because people initially get roped into lucid dreaming by hearing crazy stories that require years of training and a lot of mental conditioning, and then expect to have that experience their first time lucid dreaming, which we all know is not the case."
LucidDreaming,fpwze8x,t3_gg1l2t,1588972767.0,Yes that was very likely a false awakening. That happens to me a lot where I start journaling a dream and I make constant mistakes. Sometimes just typing in my password to my phone doesn’t work and I keep messing up until I wake up.
infp,fpwo9ci,t3_gfxy6a,1588966954.0,This is perfect. Thank you for sharing :)
LucidDreaming,fpwkxf4,t3_gfzf36,1588965267.0,"Practice and patience. Keep doing what you’re doing, and keep trying to employ stabilization techniques the moment you get lucid. It’s just gonna take time and effort from here on out."

LucidDreaming,fptzr1w,t3_gfgkpi,1588901606.0,"It’s just gonna take time, effort, and patience on your part. Continue doing what you’re doing, you’ll naturally start to gain the ability to remain conscious for longer. 

Also based on what you said, you have lucid dreamt. Lucid dreaming means you realize you’re dreaming while you’re in the dream, whether you have dream control or how long the dream lasts is completely separate from that definition. So congrats on whatever your first lucid dream was."
LucidDreaming,fptzg6k,t1_fptwueg,1588901423.0,"It’s rare for me as well, but for some people it’s common, and it happens to them many times in a row and they get freaked out by. Some get scared even after one event, so I was just adding that in case it concerned you."
LucidDreaming,fptw7ss,t3_gfj6o7,1588899507.0,"It’s a simple false awakening, happens to pretty much everyone at one point or another. Nothing to really worry about, unless it naturally freaks you out, in which case I have zero advise other than not lucid dream, it sort of just comes with the practice."
infp,fpsypca,t1_fpsst8j,1588881864.0,"Well that’s a good start. Some simple reality checks and some daily meditation, and maybe MILD, and you’ll be well on your way. That and a whole lot of dedication and motivation. You need tons of that."
infp,fprx00s,t3_gf6zdv,1588863635.0,That water and the way the sun hits is is gorgeous.
infp,fprwqkz,t1_fpr8cv3,1588863500.0,Yes indeed I can. Through much dedication and practice (although I don’t actively practice these days due to my depression and figuring out my life).
infp,fpqtbtj,t3_geyper,1588831629.0,Those clouds are insane! Man I’d love to be standing there in person.
infp,fpqsml1,t1_fpqqa8h,1588831045.0,"Thanks for not trying to put a religious spin on it in this reply, because of that I decided to respond again. 

I really do understand all of that, my depression started over a year ago and I already have attempted once, I’ve thought about all of that many times, and for me personally have come to the conclusion that I truly have the right to end my life if I want to. Yes it does impact people and messes up lives forever, but what’s the difference between them being in pain for the rest of their life or me? People always throw in that metaphor that there’s light at the end of the tunnel, but this life is shitty and unfortunately that’s not true for everyone, and I happen to be one of those people. For my specific case it’s a lose-lose situation. I die and hurt everyone around me, or I stay to please everyone else and suffer silently. 

Of course I would be horrified to find someone I care about laying dead in a closet, and I’d certainly freak out and go through the grieving process, but during that time I’d try to think about why they did it. Doing this would make me realize they were in so much pain and it such a terrible situation they saw no way out. Whether there was one or not doesn’t matter, they thought they were at the end of their rope and that they had no other options. It would be very hard, but inevitably I’d have to respect their decision and realize while they may have made an error in their choice (the choice isn’t always wrong, depending on the situation of course), it’s what they thought their best option or only option was. They were so caught up in their pain and turmoil that they just needed it to end, and that’s all there is to it. No intentionality to hurt me or anyone else and ruin our lives. Most of us actually wish we could have a button that we press and *poof* we’re gone, causing zero pain and emotional trauma. But like I said before, life is shitty, so it doesn’t work that way. 

I’m not really trying to argue too much, I’m just giving you my stance on suicide and whether it’s “okay” or not. Personally I don’t think one can ever really say it’s good or bad, right or wrong. In some context it shifts closer to one or the other (though I’d say it rarely shifts towards any negative side, because again most people who end their life *don’t* want to hurt anyone), but after everything is said and done, in some situations, one party is going to be left hurt and suffering.

Edit: oh I just saw your other comment hah"
infp,fpqaq7t,t1_fpq0n97,1588818660.0,"Yeah I’m not looking to get into any theological debates. I was once a Christian I know the whole spiel alright? No, we’re not broken and worthless and hopeless just because we don’t believe in god. I used to think highly of god, but one only needs to look at the Old Testament and their eyes will be opened to who he really is. I’m sorry but after reading your holy book I lost all respect and love and care for whatever the fuck god thinks. I honestly don’t know how people can stay Christian and study and read the Bible. I read it *once*, I didn’t even study it hardcore, and I lost it all. There is something wrong with god, all the unspeakable acts he commits in the Old Testament and then to add insult to injury he makes hell? No thanks, I’ll pass on that one. No god like the Christian god deserves any ounce of reverence or worship. Ever. Throwing people into everlasting fire and torment after a life that was already hellish, is not what someone does to someone they love. God doesn’t want your love, my love, or anyone else’s. He wants our obedience and servitude, he only wants to use us to further his own damn kingdom. Honestly even when I was a Christian I never cared about his kingdom or understood why if he loves us he wants us to fear him and serve him. That’s not love, it’s something else. 

Again, I’m not going to debate you. You can call me whatever you want, say I’m destined for hell, a lost sinner, literally whatever, I couldn’t care less. I’m much more happy and feel lighter than ever without god weighing me down, with all his commandments and trivial demands. I’m glad Christianity works for you, that’s really great, but it did nothing for me. I now feel I have more room to grow in life without any religion keeping me in a box and telling me how and what to think. Please know that if you respond I won’t be replying back again."

AstralProjection,fpireli,t1_fpiqbzt,1588647026.0,"Thank you, I don’t know why this shit was near impossible to find on the website, I just kept getting pages that explained *what* they do, nothing of experiments and tests."
AstralProjection,fpiox6i,t1_fpinhcp,1588645486.0,"Damn how do you guys get upvotes for making a bunch of big ass claims without evidence. You people are why I’m weary of this sub and anything to do with APing in general. The universe is a brain, how do you know, who or what brought you this evidence? Assuming it’s astral projection, which I ask evidence for and get nothing because there likely is nothing. I don’t even know why I’m still trying at this point. It’s a simple plea, show me the evidence. I swear to god if you guys reply one more time calling me retarded or just vaguely saying “there’s proof there’s proof!” I’m just gonna leave. You guys want to “enlighten” and “wake up” humanity, **SHOW ME EVIDENCE**."
AstralProjection,fpiok07,t1_fpinhjj,1588645262.0,"Yeah okay this will be my last reply. You do have something to prove to me, astral projection. Does it exist or not? Is there evidence for it? I ask this and you just redirect me to other places that don’t have anything. Calling me retarded over and over again won’t help me learn by the way. You seem like a fun human being."
AstralProjection,fpin23l,t1_fpilo87,1588644339.0,"God damn this subreddit is dense. I’m not closing my mind off to anything, I would like *specific examples of evidence*, not “there’s plenty of proof”. Very helpful, how about you show me the way to this proof?"
AstralProjection,fpimyf8,t1_fpill68,1588644273.0,"Alright so you won’t provide any actual links that lead to empirical evidence. Just keep telling me to “look this up” and check out Monroe institute. I am legitimately wanting to know where and what this evidence is, and you can’t provide a basic fucking link. You can’t keep telling me “go to this place and all your questions will be answered,” show me a specific article or scientific experiment that proves astral projection. And did you just miss the part where I said I want to actually learn and understand this? I’m not trolling. How is asking for facts and evidence trolling. I guess you’re not reading any of this, so I’m just wasting my time like you said. But maybe someone else will point me in a more specific direction and help out someone who actually wants to understand all this. Thanks for being so willing to lead someone to the truth."
AstralProjection,fpil3y4,t1_fpikuqw,1588643163.0,"You literally said look up Monroe Institute, did that and found their website, so logically thinking that’s where there’d be some evidence for this stuff, but I just find a bunch of articles saying this happened with no further proof and some stuff that looks like a scam (2200 dollars for random bs that no one needs)."
AstralProjection,fpikbk1,t1_fpict3q,1588642688.0,"Yes I have read the CIA document, and in it it says the person who astral projected was given coordinates by phone and had to mail back his findings, he had plenty of time to look at maps and aerial photos. As for the whole Monroe institute people, I can only find articles on their sight saying what happened, which is anecdotal evidence, but either I’m blind or you have to look deep to find what experiments he’s done. Please link something with actual empirical evidence, not something that just says what happened. 

And for the millionth damn time, I’m not fucking saying astral projection isn’t real or that you don’t experience it, you have, I have (not too different from lucid dreaming besides “realness,” which is entirely subjective and vague), and many others have experienced it too. I’m saying there isn’t any sufficient empirical evidence for it. And if it is true, doesn’t explain why almost the entirety of the human race (me included) has never had any run ins with ghosts or spirits or succubuses or anything supernatural or crazy. Why do some people magically get to have undeniable evidence while the rest of us (talking about people what truly want to know, so don’t hit me with that “they’re just denying it” bs) have to stretch what we consider evidence and make assumptions and not be completely sure of this."
2meirl42meirl4meirl,fpigo18,t1_fpieddu,1588640521.0,Yep. And I’d feel even shittier because everyone is singing the other guy’s praises and thinking your a useless nutcase and doesn’t know what’s good for yourself. Those stories always end up being about the saver.
AstralProjection,fpi8yoh,t1_fpi8to1,1588636046.0,"CIA says it’s true = it’s fact, alright I see your logic (not)."
AstralProjection,fphxqph,t1_fphwyhr,1588629757.0,"I don’t think anyone (including Daniel’s comment here) who criticizes astral projection denies that people experience what they report to, it’s just believed to be immediately understood that we’re denying the claims of your spirit leaving the body. Most AP deniers see it as a form of lucid dreaming or just lucid dreaming itself anyway. I’m on the fence whether it is just lucid dreaming or something different, as I said in another comment I’ve only had a few experiences, and I didn’t even make it outside of my bedroom. Though I think I’m leaning slightly towards the idea that APs are something different than lucid dreams, because like other people say and experience, I’ve also noticed the difference between my awareness and level of clarity in a lucid dream and an AP. APs are oddly clear and feel a lot more solid and real, even compared to the most vivid and realistic lucid dream. But I know that doesn’t mean I’ve left my body or anything, just that it could be some other unique state of awareness that happens within the mind alone."
AstralProjection,fphwmh7,t1_fphwf77,1588629161.0,"I would definitely agree. Some people think APing is a form of lucid dreaming, or maybe something else that still happens within the brain. Whatever it is, I know it’s a real thing because I’ve experienced it and others have too, I’m not denying AP altogether. I’m just denying all the baggage that gets added to it, the spirit leaving the body and succubus stuff and multiple dimensions."
AstralProjection,fphn7y0,t1_fphlwrr,1588624257.0,"I don’t know why you linked that site, just looks like a huge scam and waste of anyone’s time. 2200 **DOLLARS** to learn this shit? That anyone can easily do through techniques that are more or less actually just lucid dream techniques? Right. Maybe link a site or article that actually objectively and logically proves the reality of OBEs. 

I’m sorry you have a warped and limited perspective of reality, there are no occultists trying to hold back the masses from discovering the truth. There just isn’t. 

Before you get too offended, I’ll repeat myself, I’m not saying you’re wrong or that there is no spirit that leaves our body, only that there just isn’t sufficient proof for such claims."
LucidDreaming,fphk1dm,t3_gd8793,1588622643.0,"Okay, 1-3, the answer is maybe. How could I know, it’s your dream. Dreams are random and unpredictable, unless you know how to properly use dream control techniques, but even then still. Dream figures are as varied as people in reality. Some are dumb, weird, smart, insane, or boring. Whatever fashion a human might exist in so could a dream figure, there’s no telling how they’ll act or whatever. 

Answer to 4 is it is not impossible to spawn dream figures, it’s all about belief. If you don’t know about this then I’m not sure why you’d be looking to spawn a dream figure, you should learn some dream control techniques, but the underlying principle behind every one is that you have to truly believe it will happen. 

For 5 I’d like to say I don’t know that either, but it wouldn’t be entirely true. What I don’t know is how you’ll act or what you’ll do in the dream, if I knew exactly what you’d do then maybe I could say what would be the likely outcome, at least with the specific example of whether he’d stay or leave. If you’re very lucid and present and are constantly interacting with him, sure he might stick around for a while (again, even granting that you stay very lucid and are constantly talking and doing things with him, the dream may have other plans and goku might randomly vanish or turn into beerus or something else entirely wacky and crazy might happen). If you lose lucidity he might still be around in your non lucid dream, but there’s no saying as you and I don’t know how the dream would evolve after that. If you do remain lucid and stop focusing on him, then he’ll likely disappear and your attention will be on whatever you moved on to, flying, trying to walk through a wall, make something else appear (unless you remember goku and keep him in mind and continuously talk to him while doing these things)."
LucidDreaming,fphiad1,t1_fph60lb,1588621768.0,"And after you do that, do a heckin more research. Look at multiple sources too."
