I abruptly stopped in November due to a back problem and haven’t run since. However, I’m thinking I should ditch the gym for the time being due to germs and may use this time to start running again (even if it’s just a mile or two at a time or with walking intervals.)

My question is—I’m scared my lungs will be worse if I’m running in the cold (30s-50s) and don’t want to weaken my lungs with all of this going on! Will running make my lungs weaker?"
