Yes I've been greyrocking for a while now, not always successfully and it's against my nature because I'm normally very open and direct. It's so frustrating to have to keep quiet and not call him out on his behaviour, but it's just not worth the inevitable blow ups. I'm exhausted from them over the last few years. 
There's no custody plan in place as yet, which I'm hoping will be in my favour if I'm able to move away. I regret ever putting him on the birth certificate, would have been a lot easier legally. I almost didn't because he was already being a jerk when she was a newborn, and I was going to go to the registeration alone, but at the time I didn't think it would ever get like this.
The times he's got physical have been when I'm trying to get him to leave, and you're right in that he showed sides of him I'd never expected.

Today was such a bad day, I was so close to ending it all. I can't take it for the rest of my life, and feel like she'll end up hating me too, because I'm constantly exhausted, on edge, in survival mode, that I can't be the mother I want to be, while he's the charming, playful, fun part-time dad."

The sister still lives with her too, and there's an older brother who left as soon as he was old enough to join the army, but she still manages to interfere in his life.

None of the shit these cunts put us through is normal. None of it is fair or deserved.  I think if  you or I felt normal about it, there'd be something wrong with us!

Edited to add: Sorry, that probably didn't help. I know the feeling of just wanting to be able to not feel like shit all the time. I feel like medication didn't really help when the cause of the depression was the shit that happened/is happening. It's not so much chemical imbalance as ""life is really shit right now"" And I imagine it would be easier to cope with all the shit if one didn't feel so shit, but how can you help it?

I haven't gotten rid completely yet either, I don't know how to disengage when I was sucked in enough to have a kid with him. My heart is slowly realizing what happened though, and accepting that the person I loved 
doesn't exist, never did, never will. So I suppose that's something."

My ""partner"" does the same thing. It started when I was pregnant, just as I expressed how scary it was that my body was changing, he stopped showing any interest in me, stopped hugging me, started pointing out how pretty other women were. Then when I expressed shock and upset- he told me I was being crazy and ridiculous. I swear they do it on purpose. 
I kept thinking things would get better, but they just get worse and I feel battered beyond return. I have a two year old daughter with him, and though I kicked him out when he attacked me in front of her, he's still able to be controlling, manipulative and incredibly damaging. He uses his parental ""rights"" as a means with which to attack me. Any time I don't want to see him because of his abuse he accuses me of ""using her as a weapon"".  He's an addict too, so I refuse to let him take her alone, he comes here to see her and it's just so draining. I have to pretend to play happy families, because I want that for her, sometimes I even believe it myself, but he keeps showing that he doesn't give a fuck about me, or her. 

I hate not being able to share my concerns or fears, or anything, because he can turn literally anything into an attack. I second guess everything, I end up abusing myself because I'm telling myself what he could say. I stopped bothering to say when something was wrong, or his behaviour was shitty, because it's just not worth the inevitable barage of insults. I was on medication for the anxiety and depression but all that did was numb the effects, didn't solve anything.
I won't ever be in a relationship again either, I could never trust anyone again.

You work. You have a great job. So why the fuck are they telling you to also be his submissive housewife? How does cooking and cleaning for a man make the woman ""less independent""? Doesn't it mean the man is more dependent?

  He doesn't stand up for you now, so he will not do it when they take over and fuck up your wedding, or when they walk all over you when you have ""his"" baby. They need to show you some respect, but they haven't got the decency to do it naturally, and he isn't going to make them. So what are you going to do?

But I realised recently that literally no-one in my life ""sparks joy"". No-one really rings me unless they want something from me, no one asks or cares how I am. Any time I ty to talk about how I'm feeling, they either bring it back to themselves, or make light of it, or they're just enjoying the drama. Like, I would come away from every single person in my life just drained and exhausted, feeling bad about myself. 

I reflected a lot the other day, after losing my temper too many times, and realised that no -one ""fills my cup"" so to speak. And therefore, fuck them and their shitty company. I've been looking for what I need in the wrong places, where I'd never got it before anyway. I'm taking some time for me, and hoping that by removing the drains on me, I'll make room in my life for something better. And if not, I'll have the energy to work on making myself better. I figure that by doing the same things tp pass the time, just because they're familiar, I'm kind of stagnating, and that's what's making me so desperately unhappy and angry. Maybe this way I'll be forced to try new things. I don't want to fall back on the people that have damaged me to this point, just because they're all I've got. It feels like they suck the life out of me.

It really doesn't help that my daughter's father and his horrific mother are Narcs too.

NarcissisticAbuse,fh396jb,t1_fh25rt9,1581266299.0,"Thank you, I appreciate it."
NarcissisticAbuse,fh152jr,t3_f0y9n0,1581210875.0,"Mine does this too. It's just another form of manipulation. They know you don't want to, so they're trying to ""win"" by bedding you. I used to fall for it, because I'm a normal person with normal (emotional and physical) needs, and because I thought it meant something. **It doesn't**. If it was you pushing for intimacy, he'd most likely be turning you down.

Btw, last time I fell for it, he gaslit me the next day saying *I* pestered *him* for sex and he'd just gone along with it so I'd leave him alone. I ended up pregnant, treated worse than ever, told I had no choice now but to accept the abuse because ""you need me"", and nearly died from the resulting miscarriage. 0/10 would not recommend."
Divorce,fh11sr5,t3_f0z96y,1581209940.0,"Damn, he's fucked up. I'm sorry you're going through this. But you have my utmost respect and admiration for managing to take care of your baby, while heavily pregnant with your second. You're awesome, and you deserve so much better than this man."
PrayerRequests,fgueeoy,t1_fgtwfiw,1581118776.0,"Tell me about it. Are you able to talk about it with him? Mine seemed to think I should be over it when I got out of hospital. Like of course there's the trauma of what you've physically been through, but also the psychological stress, the grief of losing the baby, searching for answers as to what caused it, comparing what ""should"" be happening with what actually happened. It's like a horror movie, it doesn't even seem real. 

And don't get me started on people who say ""Oh at least you're ok, you can try again"". I know they mean well, but it's so upsetting."
PrayerRequests,fgsxpty,t1_fgqqh0y,1581094822.0,"Thank you, I appreciate it. 
It's a lot of trauma for anyone to go through, and I don't think most people get how deeply it can affect us."
witchcraft,fgqpboi,t3_ezvorr,1581028661.0,"I think you know what they sent each other on SnapChat. What's driving you mad is that you don't want to believe it.

It's not your emotions you need to control. They evolved as shortcuts to tell you what to do. You're angry because you've been decieved and disrespected. You're afraid because it means what you thought you had with him no longer exists. You can't force yourself to not feel these things, because they are the truth. The fresh start is the one you make without him.

You know at some point you will need to check his messages again, because you will need to confirm he's not talking to her again. What if he is? Or someone else that showed him some attention? You'll have to go through all this pain again, and more, because you'll be angry at him for lying to you again. Why should you be gaslighting yourself over his behaviour?

Do you honestly believe this girl ended up in hospital if nothing physical happened between them? Don't you think he's going to talk to her again, at least to see how she is? 

I'm really sorry you're going through this. It's not your fault. 

BTW post this on r/FemaleDatingStrategy  they give really good advide and guidance."
depression,fgqmh5h,t1_fgpbpqv,1581027025.0,"Damn, me too."
PrayerRequests,fgqjznz,t3_ezqpd5,1581025660.0,"Hi, I understand what you're going through, It's been a few months since my miscarriage, and I almost died from the bloodloss. Ever since then, I start getting anxiety and stress leading up to my period. The first one was the worst, I had panic attacks, flashbacks and felt accutely all the pain and fear of that time again.  It was hard to distinguish the physical pains from the memory of the pain at the time, if you know what I mean?

I'm sorry you're going through this too. It's entirely to be expected to have these feelings after what we've been through.  Take some deep breaths and try to remind yourself that what's happening is not what was happening then. And try to focus your mind on something else. I found myself dissociating but that's probably not the best way. Find a prayer or meditation beforehand that fills you with strength and recite it if you feel yourself becoming overwhelmed. 

Also, they probably told you at the hospital, but your periods might be a bit erratic for a while, so try not to worry if it's not at the time you're expectng.  

 I'm menstruating at the moment and today was a really hard day, so I believe the Divine led me to your post today. I pray that you will find the strength within yourself to get through this dark time. Please feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk to."

JustNoFriend,fgifbr5,t1_fgh5xez,1580819784.0,"Ugh that's a lot to put on you. You ought to Konmari that stuff, and make the place more ""you"" again. You could donate it, or sell it on Ebay and get yourself something that YOU picked out. I'm pretty sure some places even pick up the items from you so you wouldn't have to drag them down to the charity shop."
JustNoFriend,fgh4d7e,t1_fgh3j20,1580776404.0,"It seemed like you needed to get it out there, but it's possible she might not  react in the way you'd like. Maybe she'll dismiss it and say you're being ""too sensitive"" or silly or whatever. But hopefully she'll at least respect your feelings and give you some space. 

I do this a  lot too btw, feel like I can't deal with reading someone's messages and put them into a folder. Half relieved at not having to deal with it, and half stressing over every possible thing it could be."
JustNoFriend,fgh2trr,t1_fgeepg6,1580775358.0,"Aw no need to apologise. I just meant that you were being too hard on yourself. Are you feeling any better today? 
I can't imagine someone telling off a friend for the way they speak, or having a go at a stranger in a theatre for using colloquialisms! I mean, what a shitty way to make yourself feel superior! 

You haven't let anyone down. You're allowed to change your mind, and you're allowed to put your own comfort ahead of the fear of pissing someone off. 

Have you checked your messages from her?"
JustNoFriend,fge2gin,t3_exveac,1580689856.0,"I thought you'd attacked someone or something from the title :) It sounds like a pretty polite and restrained message you sent tbh. It's not like you even said ""You've been a dick lately and I don't want to see you"". Is it the turning down the invitation that's making you feel bad, or is it something about letting her know a bit about how you're feeling? 

How are you feeling now? And how did your mum respond? x"
britishproblems,fg7vci8,t3_exejga,1580602389.0,Is it one of those hot water dispensers? It doesn't feel right if you haven't just boiled the kettle.
