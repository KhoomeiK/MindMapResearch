P.S. It turns out all of those people have experience with trans youth, a distinction I never made. Youth here still have to jump through hoops to get where they want to go in transition; adults get to skip steps in an effort to reduce suicide rates."

Yeah, she is not welcome back again, I escorted her out the front door and haven't seen her since.

My wife shared a few new years resolutions she has with me tonight and when asked I told her I had none.

New years is just another day to me, it's not special. On top of that I have been feeling very depressed lately and I don't feel a connection to anyone anymore. I've been suicidal for 17 years and I've always had someone to hold out for but now that feeling is gone and it's scary.

I told her this and her response was to yell at me, as if I asked for or wanted this.

She doesn't see the abuse she puts me through by yelling and screaming every day and she refuses to acknowledge it. It hurts, it really does. I spend more days trying to explain this shit away to my kids than I don't.


I have an appointment coming up this month that I really need to go well, if it doesn't I really can't see myself holding on much longer."
