AskReddit,fr389m7,t1_fr1txx5,1589851956.0,Maybe you could get a masters or do PhD?
AskReddit,fr1si5a,t1_fr1owhl,1589825179.0,What were you expecting it to be and what is it like?
AskReddit,fr1it13,t1_fr1de8j,1589820463.0,  Do you like what you are studying? I think the lockdown is a major reason for your loss of drive. The lack of human contact has been driving everyone crazy.
AskReddit,fr1cvx2,t1_fr1b75n,1589817497.0,Why are you depressed?
AskReddit,fr1aldj,t1_fr192k2,1589816332.0,"Damn,  I didn't mean to unload on you.  Sorry"
AskReddit,fr1ajeh,t1_fr192k2,1589816303.0,"I don't know. I am just confused and don't know what I want. I haven't been able to be sure of anything from what career I want to what gender I like to just about everything for the past couple of months I guess. And everytime I am unsure about something new I turn to this sub,  which is not a good way to sort things out btw.  And I can't do the things that make me happy because they get in the way of doing the things I am supposed to do."
AskReddit,fr17iic,t1_fr178ls,1589814716.0,"Tell me if you do end up reading it.  I am lonely enough to start a book club with a stranger on reddit. I know that's pathetic,  but I honestly don't care."
AskReddit,fr17106,t1_fr1700o,1589814459.0,Or at least look it up
AskReddit,fr1700o,t1_fr15ivn,1589814445.0,"Maybe.
If you are a fan of books,  try reading 'The last time I wore a dress'. I just started it and hence the barrage of questions."
AskReddit,fr14qci,t1_fr14750,1589813219.0,"I finally agree with you. I have always hated labels.  They are supposed to be used to avoid confusion,  but I guess somethings are too abstract to be labeled, and labeling such things just creates more confusion. (as a completely unrelated sidenote your username hits too close to home)"
AskReddit,fr13slp,t1_fr139lg,1589812702.0,"But what if a person wanted to desperately feel like the opposite sex/gender? In your case,  you are at peace with your gender and sex,  but what if someone is not? What if being born male wasn't enough to make them feel like a man?  Because as you wrote,  the world is not black and white. There is no correct way of existing."
AskReddit,fr12guy,t1_fr129r2,1589811957.0,I think it's because sometimes a person's gender and their sex don't align?
AskReddit,fr11r2o,t1_fr11gn9,1589811551.0,"I am the one who doesn't want to sound sarcastic this time (seriously), I looked up the definitions? Also I have been trying to understand gender and sexuality and am starting to see the basic differences."
AskReddit,fr118dr,t1_fr10xr4,1589811253.0,"Sex is related to your genitals , so if you have a promise you are a born male and if you have a vagina you are a born female.  Sex is assigned at birth.  Gender is more complex.  And I might not be the best person to put gender into words, as I don't understand it completely."
AskReddit,fr10x9i,t1_fr104db,1589811076.0,Lucky you. For me it has led to a torrent of confusing.
AskReddit,fr10pz0,t1_fr10blc,1589810959.0,You are confusing gender with sex
AskReddit,fr10i99,t1_fr0zybl,1589810831.0,"If it were that easy I  would not be having an identity crisis right now. Maybe that's all you need to feel like a man,  but genitals as a deciding factor are not enough for me."

AskReddit,fprwcsp,t1_fprvz1p,1588863296.0,Thanks for replying. Does it make a lot of difference than if you had just gone with petroleum engineering?I want to know whether it's more helpful because it makes you stand out amongst other candidates for jobs or because of the knowledge you gain.
