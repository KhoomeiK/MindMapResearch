But I’ve been calling around to a few places to see about getting some shirts with Alex’s poster on it donated so if you know anyone or any company who’d be able to do this or if you can reach out to more t shirt printing places, that would be great. I think it would be especially beneficial for the family of course but also for those who are able to canvas more often, for those involved in the search who work/frequent in popular places in midtown area (bars, Golden 1 Center, on Sac state campus, etc) and are able to wear the shirt while working

If that specifically doesn’t work out, we could also see if the printing companies would be able to donate just the t-shirt printing if we bring our own shirts. I’m hoping Amazon would be willing to donate a bulk amount of plain tshirts for this given Alex’s situation."
Sacramento,ffhetbl,t3_eiq4xk,1579932285.0,"*Also,

Everyone don’t forget to share to YOUR neighborhood Nextdoor page. 

I know it was originally shared to Alex’s Nextdoor community page by OP but we need to get it out into every. single. neighborhood. Unfortunately, I can guarantee you a large majority of the people in your neighborhood are unaware of his case and if every person in here posted it to their Nextdoor page, neighborhood by neighborhood we’d get the word out there even more. Also if your neighborhood has any other online private pages such as on FB, please share there. 
 
Some other easy ways to spread the word:

•if you are a parent, teacher, or are involved with any online school pages where you know parents/guardians are active on, please share to there as well.

•if you play a sport, are in a club, part of a sorority or fraternity:

  -post in your groups online social media page about Alex.
  -at your next meet up make a quick announcement to that group about Alex. 
  -hang up posters at your meet up area/sports locker room/Greek house.
-plan a time with some if not all of the members to meetup to canvass & search.

•getting your hair done, nails, lashes- bring a poster & talk to everyone there about it!

•Drive for a taxi/Uber/Lyft? Pop a poster into a clear paper sleeve, thread some string through the holes & tie a poster to the back of each of your front seat headrests. Tape a poster up on the dash for the passenger seat!

•Deliver packages for Amazon Flex or work for a delivery company? Slip a mini poster under the mat next to the package/stick it in the door (not in the mailbox tho, not trying to get anyone in trouble lol)

•Deliver food for Postmates/Uber Eats/Doordash - grab some mini posters and hand them out with the food. 

•Out to eat with friends? Along with bringing posters to hang if you’re able to, even easier, have some mini posters with you and leave it with the check. Even better if they have one, in the bill black book (perhaps they’ll keep it there & it’ll gain more attention from each following customer)

•Heading to a game or event & want to help on the way?  In the parking lot, slide some posters under the windshield wipers. You can do this at any parking lot for that matter. Some other popular parking lots: 
     -School campus lots/mall parking lots/airports/movie theater/Costco/Walmart/etc.

•Mailing something or checking your PO Box? Leave a poster on the advertisement/message board most places have 
 
•Work somewhere with a parking garage, live in a gated community, or simply going somewhere with a parking attendant booth? Ask them to hang a poster up in their window

•Have any sort of social media? Post his poster/Tag your friends on Alex’s social media pages/Use his poster as your profile picture or banner picture. (Social media banners & digital posters are already made & waiting on his website FindAlexHolden.com.)

• Taking a quick trip to San Francisco, Lake Tahoe, anywhere? Bring some posters and put some up there. 

•Along with laminating a poster & putting it on your car, another option- grab/order a car window marker & spread Alex’s story & website that way. 

•Going anywhere with a public bathroom? Bring some posters/tape and hang a poster on the bathroom door or on the back of the stall!

•Have a friend or family member who lives in another town/city just up or down the road? Send them Alex’s poster & ask them to share on their Nextdoor pages and all around their town. (Even better, if you are able to go the extra mile, continue to share with those even further away towns/cities/states!) 

AND ALTHOUGH IVE SAID IT BEFORE- EASIEST OF ALL, AIRDROP HIS POSTER WHERE EVER YOU GO!


(Edit: added some more ideas that popped up)"
Sacramento,ffhecba,t3_eiq4xk,1579931773.0,"I’m not in the area or I would be doing this there & will do this around my area but;

I think we should start asking certain drive thrus that bring in a lot of traffic to hang Alex’s poster (or mini version if it’s too big) up on/near their drive through window. Think about how many people go through drive thrus daily & the minutes usually spent sitting there starring off waiting for your food/drink- the perfect time for those people, especially the people who don’t use social media, to read & learn about Alex. Even at gas stations on the posts next to the machine!

Again, I’m not in the area so please ask whatever places you know of and think would bring the most attention! Off the top of my head I think some of the best places would be:

-All the Starbucks 
-Dutch brothers 
-in n out
-chik fil a
-McDonald’s 
-drive thru pharmacy’s 
-bank atms

Also, if you frequent a Gym or sports club, please bring a poster to hang there next time you go."

SuicideWatch,ffe352p,t1_f59acew,1579835470.0,"You think that people who are on the brink of killing themselves, minutes away from doing so, bombarded with internal pain and dark thoughts, weapon/drug in hand, are going to come here to get help!?-to a place where they know they cannot express exactly what’s haunting them if it does not abide by your strict terms & conditions, such as if ones pain is caused by or worsened by the outside opinions or actions of others towards them (which for many can be a huge contributing factor to their suicidal thoughts)?! Do you think they will have time or motivation to pause their overwhelming thoughts to write out a rough draft in order to make sure it complies? No. 

And what if that person’s, (who is feeling completely alone, whose literally about to end their entire existence right then & there) ability to healthily get through that pain caused by others (as mentioned above) revolves around feeling supported and understood by others who have actually experienced this specific type of pain before?, who have EMPATHY (not just sympathy), reassurance, and experienced based support/tips that could stop them from killing themselves then & there. How would you go about addressing that without breaking your rules? 

That being said, if someone felt a certain way and another individual agreed or felt the same way, they would indeed be breaking those rules. Then why is this a community? Why is this public? You should all just sign up to work for crisis hotline at this point, where it can be one on one messages since no one is able to share feelings or have empathy towards another ones situation. 

People who are about to end it all wont reach out for support if it means they have to abide to ridiculous rules which restrict explaining how they actually feel, knowing they won’t be seeking support or advice from others who have experienced it, and especially won’t feel like they are actually talking to someone who really cares or will help them knowing that these same individuals are more worried about patrolling the comments feelings you are allowed to express rather than saving the life of a human being."

Alex has been missing for 22 days! No leads. No sitings. No footage. Nothing. What would you suggest we do then? Who would you like us to consider then? Or do you not want us to consider anyone?, wouldn’t want to hurt the feelings of sex offenders, cause that’s definitely a priority while we’re looking for a missing kid. I’m not questioning the elderly at the old folks home, I’m questioning SEX OFFENDERS and people with a VIOLENT HISTORY , many of which happen to live seconds away from Alex’s last known location. Due to their prior history, they have placed themselves higher on the list of people to check out when something like this happens. Why would we not think about these possibilities, as there is literally no sign of Alex leaving that area? This is the time to start thinking about potential people who would be of more risk than others. Just a few days back in Sacramento a homeless man stabbed a teenager at a bank and killed him! He was also discovered to be a registered sex offender! So pondering an idea like this is rational considering the fact we are at a standstill with leads. “Undesirable things”?!

I don’t know why one of his friends wouldn’t step up to do it as they’d be better than a stranger but I do know they are young & have busy lives. I’m sure amazon would understand if a friend of his needs to take a leave to do this. It’s a missing person we’re talking about here, and more so for Amazon, a manager of their company. If they aren’t stepping up just because they need to work in order to make the rent/ bills, I really feel like with the gofundme & the family resources that that would be attended to if it meant there is an organized, thorough, & continuous community search effort being conducted, especially while the parents are back across the country. :("
Sacramento,fevq1ro,t1_fevn3md,1579400103.0,"Those accounts (Twitter & instagrams)  are for sharing the standard information regarding his disappearance  ( his missing poster & missing details) on every platform.

It is there to provide those who haven’t heard about Alex, knowledge of this problem & direct resources/contacts to reach out to if they have any legitimate info/tips on Alex. 

Whether 2 accounts or 100,  it is getting the same standard information about his disappearance out there.

If they want to follow up/get involved/daily updates, they can do so with the links/info provided on the website & this reddit page.

As for the Facebook gal you mentioned, unfortunately we as the public don’t have control over people creating more random pages just to speculate to satisfy their love of  true crime, but I’m sure theres gotta be a way the family/friends/law enforcement can get them removed if she’s providing false information about his case & setting up unapproved events.

Yes organization is good and it’s been pretty organized up until this point, but it was also not getting attention like it should be. Yes there may be new or multiple pages coming up, but that just means it’s getting out there.  Right now main priority should be getting it known to our community: ALEX HOLDEN IS MISSING.

Sacramento,fevh551,t3_eiq4xk,1579397369.0,"One person just messaged this to the @Findalexholden twitter page. I have no idea about the streets/businesses in that area of sac or if this is a possibility but I thought I’d share his message/suggestions:

“He seems like a very smart guy. Too smart to take the suggested route that late at night. From 20th, it would have made more sense to go left on E and right on North 16th. Check the Blue Diamond Nut gift shop security footage and the other various businesses in that area. Lots of cameras. There is a casino he would have walked right by too.” 

Also, I’m trying to get everyone who follows that twitter & the Instagram ( @haveyouseenalexholden or @findalexholden ) to tag at least 3 friends. I figure it’s a    quick easy way for people skimming through to help share. If each person tags at least 3 friends and then they each tag 3 friends and so on, we will get a lot of coverage. Especially with the younger crowds who may not watch the news but are around Alex’s age group & may have some type of info. We need it. And with all the people that we have helping here on this thread, I’m sure many of us have shared Alex’s info with some friends/family but if you can tag other friends/family/coworkers/acquaintances/businesses/etc it would really help. 

Also, as I mentioned before in a long post (I don’t know if it got lost in the comments) AIRDROP ALEX’S MISSING POSTER WHERE EVER YOU GO! Whether you’re out to eat at a restaurant, on campus, on your break at work, strolling down the streets of Sac, it will continuously be a way to keep informing new people about Alex’s disappearance."

Could those in that area/those canvassing for Alex possibly airdrop his missing poster to those that pop up as available to air drop? Last time I was down in that area hundreds of profiles popped up whilst airdropping a picture to my friend. That would definitely help get attention especially by those who are not on social media/do not follow the news. Sort of like an amber alert for Alex in a way. Anyone located in Sac/Roseville especially in popular areas like Sac state, midtown, malls, etc. could do this. I feel most would understand if they received it as it isn’t some advertisement or prank popping up on their airdrop, it’s a missing person.

Sacramento,feg1k93,t1_fefshkw,1579072972.0,"True, but perhaps he would if he was still intoxicated from the bar, upset following a huge fight with his girlfriend at 2am, with a phone that was about to die ( though the car was dead, maybe he hoped it would somehow charge), on a cold night in Birkenstock shoes. If he had already taken something that night, had some left, and didn’t have work the next morning, it makes even more sense."
Sacramento,fefyjku,t1_fefitxg,1579069566.0,"( @milointangito , @argustwentytwenty , @Hecatenight , @Mo-Hair , @1Redbird86 , @BoozeWitch , @Happy-Anxiety — great thoughts, theories, and possibilities that I didn’t even think of and agree with. Hoping they have looked into or will look into all these factors ASAP) 

I also thought if she had been secretly involved with/secretly dating a coworker from Amazon, then of course they’d both make sure to show up the next morning. Perhaps Alex came home to something or someone he wasn’t expecting to see. 

It would explain the argument as well as his leaving. That being said, if that was the scenario, did he leave by his choosing? If so, I think the role of suicide in this entire disappearance would definitely make sense, as many would be heartbroken coming home to a scenario like this, especially if intoxicated. However, what if it wasn’t by his choosing? What if his phone was turned off as they drove away from the apartment? Have all cameras on ALL streets leaving the apartment been checked? Who knows, perhaps if they were we might see the girlfriend leaving in a vehicle (not necessarily Hers) around the time Alex is thought to have disappeared. Or perhaps we could see one of their coworkers leaving that area during that late time period. Hell, Maybe both of them, together!Who knows! Would make sense if they have looked at her car and found nothing as it could have been a coworkers car. There are hundreds of people working for Amazon in sac, so it could even be someone Alex wasn’t aware of. Was the girlfriends pings & locations checked on her phone by LE from the time he went missing? 

It doesn’t make sense if you think about it. If Alex came home late that night at the time she said he did and she was sleeping, I’m curious as to how an argument or “emotional conversation” took place. Yes, she said he had woken her up coming back from the bars, but If she was actively sleeping, I find it hard to understand how she wouldn’t have just passed back out. Even after bitching to the person who just woke me up, myself and many others would usually and logically close my eyes again and resume sleeping. Since that didn’t seem to happen according to the GF, how could her being mad about him waking her up lead to an EMOTIONAL conversation. Her saying emotional conversation is more suspicious than saying an argument, as many people would’ve had if they were woken up. He “woke her up”, he didn’t run over her puppy, so what turned the conversation into an EMOTIONAL one? You gotta be a licensed drama queen to turn something like that into an emotional conversation. It Makes more sense that him walking in on her with someone would lead to an emotional conversation rather than being woken up from sleeping... I hope her phone would have been thoroughly checked besides just reviewing her conversation with Alex, but am worried that since it is not classified as a criminal investigation, it may not have been. Could that reveal people she had been texting/calling that night?, location that night?, or even something as simple as seeing if she had texted anyone during the time frame she says she was sleeping. 

I know many are gonna be sensitive that I am questioning the girlfriend, but then when is a proper time to start doing that? Week 3 of him missing? Week 4? NO. It’s already been way too long that he’s been missing and now more than ever is the time to question. If she is truly getting mad by the questioning, then that would be selfish on her part, it is about locating Alex and bringing attention and answers to his case. Yeah, If I were her and strangers were questioning if I was involved in my boyfriends disappearance (which is already traumatizing enough), I would be insulted on the inside as well but I wouldnt want any information or ideas to be withheld that could help because it could hurt MY feelings. these questions would arise in any case like this and you’d have to understand that these people questioning are just trying to get answers and find the boy after two long weeks of him being missing. HE is priority. 

On a different note, I’m Wondering if they have done any thorough searches of the apartment since it is not being considered a criminal investigation. By thorough, I mean searching for signs of blood/DNA that wouldn’t be visible by just walking through doing a search. That would indicate any signs of struggle. Also wondering if each of the neighbors apartments have been checked as well on some level. You never know if he was acquaintances/buds with a neighbor and never mentioned it to the GF.  Maybe they happened to invite him in that night? Not even suggesting something malicious happened ( if the neighbor theory was a possibility ), but perhaps maybe something went wrong in regards to messing around with drugs that night or something. 

Additionally, were dumpsters by the last area his phone pinged at thoroughly checked BEFORE it was picked up in waste management’s weekly rounds? Trash could’ve been picked up before it was checked or if it was checked in time, was each piece of garbage gone through? Someone could’ve turned off & tossed the phone in there that night. It would unfortunately be long gone now if it was in the trash due to WM & the many homeless folks who sort through the bins. :(

I’m sorry if people don’t like my ideas, but for god sakes it’s been over TWO WEEKS. NO EVIDENCE OR LEADS. We have to start thinking about every situation and scenario here. I know if it was me missing, I would hope my family does just that: Investigate everyone in my life, as many of the missing persons cases involve someone the victim knows. I’ve had several ex’s go from being kind to suddenly abusive, several coworkers going from friendly to creepy; You. Never. Know.

Not saying that this is the case as I personally think a stranger being involved in his disappearance is also just as possible. But I think it’s important for people to keep sharing all possibilities they have thought of. That’s how we’ll get more eyes on the case and more options and possibilities to investigate, as sad as some possibilities may be.

I’m sorry if this sounds mean, but right now the thing we care about the most here is not people’s feelings getting hurt, it is ALEX. And if the ideas we share may lead to more potential theories worth investigating and might possibly lead us closer to finding Alex, then that matters more to many of us than peoples feelings at this time. For god sakes, yesterday a poor 14 y/o kid was found deceased in a CHIMNEY of a house just yards from his house. He had been missing for a month! A few days before, a man hanging from a tree on the side of our freeway! :( Anything is possible and after over two weeks of Alex being missing, it is so crucial for the sake of finding him that all theories and ideas be considered. 

We will find Alex."

Didn’t know what happened to it for MONTHS until I got a call from ECOATM headquarters in Kentucky (I believe) letting me know someone had sold my phone to them. For those who do not know, eco atm are machines (literally atms) all around the us for selling electronics. You get cash instantly once it is accepted into the machine. Someone had sold them mine as “broken” which is why it was accepted, even though they had just shut it off, otherwise eco atm would’ve rejected it. When people sell their electronics to the machine, the machine requires an ID to scan. So they were able to work with police in my area to identify who stole it and sold it. Perhaps it would be of use to contact eco atm to see if they have been sold any iPhones or air pods that match Alex’s items description. It could even be sitting in the machine uncollected to send to eco atm headquarters still. Who knows, they could have and then they would have the ID of the person who sold it which could lead to information about Alex’s whereabouts."

Although he was not spotted on camera, Is there anyway police can take the security camera footage they were able to obtain from both possible paths he is believed to have traveled and pull every car license plate that passed through those paths during the time frame he is believed to have left the house/gone missing? I know it may seem like a lot, but if it was that late at night perhaps there wouldn’t be as many cars on the road. They could run all plates & possibly pull up the drivers names/info/perhaps individuals with criminal history. They could then identify who was passing through during that time & see what they’re up to/where their located/any suspicious activity. Eventho he may not be on camera he may have been picked up/taken off camera. Who knows, it could pull up someone with prior criminal history who would have motive to grab him. If they by chance do have someone like this and suspicion, they could pull footage from where this vehicle continued to travel that night. I know I know, it’s a lot, but I just feel desperate since it’s almost been a week and there’s absolutely no clues. Trying to think of every single thing. Everyone here is amazing for their concern and have several smart ideas that many wouldn’t think of. I pray he is found safe."
