unpopularopinion,et2gpdx,t1_et2gdpa,1562416598.0,FYI I don’t act out on the rage but can definitely feel it and control it. It’s not violent or anything just sucks
unpopularopinion,et2gdpa,t3_c9rn2j,1562416458.0,"It’s the worst. So hard to explain to people as well. They think your just being dramatic. My biggest triggers are doors closing, repetitive noise like snoring (fml) and phone music/sound. The rage is unreal and I can’t help it."
unpopularopinion,et2d3kx,t3_c9slzi,1562414959.0,Reading is fundamental guys. They explained how you wouldn’t be putting your ssn into the actual websites geez. I like the plan. Instagram is like 80% children who troll - crazy Stan - etc I wouldn’t mind everyone actually under 18 off social media
