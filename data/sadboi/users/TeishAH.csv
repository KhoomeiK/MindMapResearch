He’d buy me lunch or drive me home when he could but we were both in relationships. We never had Facebook or Instagram so we never reconnected in any way. Flash forward 6 years, he walks into my Halloween store and the first thing we caught up on was how we both recently got out of our 10 year relationships. We exchanged numbers, and have been dating for 7 months now. It’s been the best relationship of our lives. We both suffered from the same issues in our last relationships (very different diets, no work ethic from spouses etc) and are amazing partners together.

That’s something I’ve always wondered. You’ll see announcements of “this show adds a gay couple to the cast!” But you wouldn’t see the same treatment for a straight couple. Why? Because it’s not as common is how people treat it. We acknowledge in the form of celebration the differences we try so hard to deny exist. Discrimination can take shape in the form of punishment or celebration. To celebrate one is to punish the other in a sense. I cannot deny the differential treatment and then try to see it as true, honest equality. Now I’m not leaning one way or the other, but in terms of fairness it shouldn’t even be mentioned if it’s equal."
