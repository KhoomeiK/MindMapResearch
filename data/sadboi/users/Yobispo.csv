They looked to me to say something and I told the kid that he should do it if he wanted to, but when he feels right about it.  At 17, I knew whatever i said could possibly be repeated to everyone at school (in CA) so there was no way I was going to make an ass of myself for these 2 dumb elders.

exmormon,fqasoou,t1_fq9eqxe,1589224606.0,"I like this advice a lot.  A cool-off may be wise.  We did a F2F with my in-laws when we left in 2016 and they are old-school Rexburg type TBMs (FIL since died).  Personally, I was way too angry for the conversation.  My MIL also has a very strong personality and she couldn't help but throw verbal punches and I couldn't help punching back.  It got ugly.  So maybe a little time could help and COVID might be the perfect excuse to cool off.  
I have also always liked the approach where you tell them that you will be happy to talk but not until they read XYZ church essays.  You name them.  Hell, name just your favorite one.  If they are not willing to read even a single church-approved essay then they're showing you that they don't respect you enough to take the time.  If they do read it, then you have a conversation on just that issue.    
It'll almost always go back to feelings/spiritual experiences.  Be prepared with a good question about this, like, ""When a muslim, catholic, evangelical or even a FLDS has a spiritual experience, is it valid?  Why would God allow any spiritual experiences to those people if there was a possibility that it would confuse them into staying catholic or whatever?""   
Most of all, they're in shock and they're hearts are breaking because they think they've lost you forever.  That's really hard for a parent. It doesn't excuse shitty behavior, but it at least is good to remember that they're filled with decades of fear of this exact thing and now it's scaring the shit out of them and that fear is real to them.

Good luck!!"

exjw,fq3j3gb,t1_fpx9do9,1589066988.0,"The premise of Mormonism is that an apostasy ruined Jesus’ true church so a restoration was needed. Joseph Smith is the prophet God called to restore the truth and the proper authority. The Book of Mormon and a bunch more innovations are supposed to be evidence. Bring ham Young followed him and there is a chain of authority to the current guy. So Mormons really do believe they are in gods own properly authorized and fully restored religion and that their Prophet (a 93 year old retired surgeon named Russell) receives direction from God. Lately there have been lots of organizational changes like combining men’s groups and shortening meetings and the Mormons, starved for actual revelation from the prophet, are going bonkers over it as though God cares about meeting times.

exmormon,fplgdce,t3_ge25s8,1588712220.0,"Hey man, I'm feeling the pain from your post.  I had a rocky time as a bishop primarily due to a really abusive SP and then immediately into Prop 8 upon my release.  That was 2008.  After Prop 8 I very slowly went down the rabbit hole and did everything I could to stay in, even volunteered to teach morning seminary for a couple years.  But as you have found out, you cannot unlearn facts and the facts are really, really bad. 

The best thing I did, not intentionally but because i can't keep anything from my wife's radar, was share with her everything as I went.  RSR and the book about Emma, Mormon Enigma, were on my nightstand and I'd often read crazy shit to her after I'd read.  She wasn't as interested in the history but she saw that my efforts were sincere so when it really got bad it wasn't a surprise.  It's all I could talk or think about, my kids thought church history was like doing chores. But it finally crashed for me in 2016.  My only point being, you need to bring her into your confidence as soon as possible or it'll get worse.  

We found a therapist after we left, someone with training in religious trauma.  Make no mistake, you have been traumatized by this upheaval of your entire world view and its gonna suck for a while as you screw your head back on straight.  Maybe you can find someone like that in your area and beg your sweetheart to come with you.  

Last thought, I always feel sorry for the 2nd spouse.  Your wife will have all the same defenses and triggers that you had but she will have the additional burden of sifting through it with the weight of saving you and the kids on her back.  That's awful, but I'd wager she'll feel that extra weight. Not her fault, either, just when the second spouse is hit with the truth their training kicks in and she will feel huge responsibility to be the savior of the family.  

PM me anytime.  My family did a podcast with John Dehlin last year and someone on this thread already linked to it.  Maybe it can help a little.  All the best!"

You don't need to serve a mission.  The life skills and interesting experiences you can learn on a mission can be learned in many other environments.  Plus, in the army, peace corp or college you don't have to spend 2 years teaching things that are easily falsified.  You don't have to pretend to like those options, like your companion, your area, your mission president or anything else.  If you go to college and hate it, you can change and it's not a character flaw. 

You have all the options in the world, so take a little time to think about what you want to do, and go do it.  You will do great, and I'm proud of you for doing the more difficult but more rewarding thing with your life."
