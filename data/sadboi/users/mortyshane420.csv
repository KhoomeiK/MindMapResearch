Advice,fhsv6cl,t3_f4rr8q,1581865854.0,"Hey, this is just my opinion. If you are questioning it and not happy currently you should go for the old job. If your going to spend most of your life working you should do something you like, live a smaller life. Whether we like to admit it or not we spend alot of time at the workplace, so even the nurse job makes more money you would be probably miserable working there with the night shifts and weekends. To me the extra money wouldnt be worth it but like I said its just my opinion."
Anxiety,fhh6t4a,t3_f379rz,1581595876.0,"I do the exact thing, I used to puke 8-12 times a day and I got it down to about 1-2 depending on the day... it kinda got better when I stopped putting myself constantly in situations I wasn't comfortable in. Because for me one of my problems is I want everyone happy and I end up doing whatever anyone asks me to the point my room becomes filthy and I havnt eaten in a day. But I also realized some of my family is controlling and they know if they guilt trip me I'll do anything, so once I started not letting people step over me(I still help people alot I just realize when I need to do stuff for myself and my bf)
. Being able to say no for once in my life and having a choice in what I do has been the opening but I still have to work on the confidence part. Because sometimes somebody can ask me a question and I'll go vomit if I dont know how to answer it. So I'm working on being able to say I dont know, I spent my whole life being expected to know everything and got yelled at when I didn't know. 


Sorry if that was confusing but maybe it's the situation not thoughts making you vomit. Maybe try paying attention when you feel the need to vomit and see if you were alone, with people, maybe when you talk to a certain type of person you get anxious. I dont think much when I get the need to vomit. I think its being overwhelmed with the situation. But I am no doctor and still need to narrow down my puking to 0."

Me and the bf at the time moved with my father. He was manuliptive but I was kinda always a daddies girl and didn't get he was using me, he was also a druggie. They gave me alot of liquor and I shouldn't of had any(I dont drink at all anymore because of it) and I just sat in my room for like 3 years no joke. When I left that bf I didn't realize my dad was manipulating me and I was in a bad place(guys with guns, and guys with all sorts of illegal problems I dont wanna remeber. 

My current bf had met me at his job well I was buying a phone, he got to know me shortly after and asked if I could stay at his place for now, he didn't want anything or for me to feel like I'd owe him. He knew my dads rep(he was commonly known in the small town) and didn't want me to have to be in that type of situation. And I was starting to get scared to live with my dad because his gf was always hitting him and breaking bones. I use to get in trouble for calling the cops. So I moved in, thinking I'd get back on my feet or go stay with my mom. But getting to know him I started to fall for him, he always said he wasn't looking so I didn't bother. But one day he asked me if I was ready to start dating again maybe we could try it for a month, to see how it would go. And then we've been together since. Right now I've never had a job, left school in 10grade cause of my stupid mistakes and choices on guys at the time, or income. I guess it would be me working on my mental health well I clean around the house and get my life together, I just havnt gotten to that point yet.
