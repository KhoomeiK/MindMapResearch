bipolar,f47a3m6,t1_f479v9i,1571419465.0,I go to a small college. I have a counselor and doctor here as well as a women’s group I go to.
bipolar,f46nonp,t3_djmfx2,1571411169.0,I’ve felt like that before. Like you almost still what to feel a bit sick to know that it’s real and maybe show others it is too. Those kinds of thoughts are super normal. But keep going with your meds. You have achieved the goal!
bipolar,f46mwq6,t3_djnkn3,1571410895.0,Woebot is a great app. It tracks your mood as well as teaching you CBT techniques. And it’s quite funny as well!
bipolar,f46mnki,t1_f46m7e3,1571410798.0,I went off my med on the advice of my doctor cause he wanted to see if I’d be okay without it but obviously that didn’t turn out well. Thank you for the reply though. Makes me feel less alone
bipolar,f2evelk,t1_f2euu7m,1570204701.0,Somewhat. I have someone who can understand as well as give me advice so I’m more prepared to deal with the struggles.
bipolar,f2ejzv8,t3_dd0cm3,1570197369.0,"I got it from my dad and seeing how much he’s struggled with it makes me scared for my own life. But I know that I will be better because it’s more recognized now and less stigmatized. I really want kids and I’m hoping by then that medical science is good enough that it will barely effect them. But yeah I get what you mean, it’s still scary."
