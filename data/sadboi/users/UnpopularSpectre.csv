But when someone says, ""nationalized healthcare"" we call them communist. Or when someone says, ""maybe we should figure out a way to pay for college so we can get more nurses and doctors,"" we say that paying tuition would bankrupt us...after spending over 3 trillion in Iraq and being on the brink of war with Iran.

The Commander in Chief, alongside a guy who makes shitty pillows and the head of Raytheon, are trying to figure out a way to just throw resources at something like we do everything else that's not important. They're treating the situation as if it's a new war effort after another Pearl Harbor. But, it's not. They might as well be shadow-boxing.

Meanwhile, another warped value that has been exposed is pay. Anyone who mentioned a $15/hr minimum wage was called a loon. It would bankrupt businesses. Then came a pandemic that would have REALLY bankrupted them. As businesses try to open, they are having a hard time trying to bring back employees who are [\*losing\* money by going back to work](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/21/838879361/bitter-taste-for-coffee-shop-owner-as-new-600-jobless-benefit-closed-her-busines). It turns out people prefer a livable wage. 

I'm not pointing the finger at any one particular person to blame (China is to blame), but I believe some political narratives have crumbled in the face of adversity while others are looking pretty damn appealing.

So, he kicked the responsibility to the governors who are also thinking to themselves, ""What the fuck just happened?"" They decided to pass the hot potato down to the local officials. 

Then, you have an elected county judge, whom everyone keeps asking, ""Who the fuck are you? Where is Ed?"" To which she responds, ""Put your mask on or pay $1,000.""

Today the governor said, ""Hey, lady, you are overstepping your bounds as a public servant. You can't charge people like that.""

I am saying DPS does have them, and I am saying they dispatched one of them to the Harding raid to help support (shoot) civilians. 

I'm not as concerned with the nomenclature as you are. If bullets are spraying out of a device attached to a helicopter, or a man holding a device from the helicopter, well damnit it's a helicopter being used to attack from the air.

Either way, it doesn't matter what you call it. What matters is that as a society we allow cops to do this like it's fucking Iraq."

How long would it take for any of you to realize a co-worker is doing something unethical? 

I'm not going to bash HPD because I do believe we have one of the best police departments in the country that does hire a force that reflects our community's diversity. 

I will, however, bash law enforcement and the blue lives matter culture that enables the long-running terrorism of the citizenry. 

From the DPS that sent an attack helicopter, to the immediate demonization of the victims by the chief and the head of the officers' union; the culture was as quick to blame society as it was to shoot the victims.

Have they apologized yet? No. They incarcerated people for decades with impunity. Our country has the largest population of incarcerated people for a reason. We incentivize it. We pay people to do it and expect them to meet goals as we would someone we hire to sell magazine subscriptions. 

So, to the blue lives matter culture, I ask if they wonder why a sizable portion of this country hates them. Or do they keep their heads so far up each others asses like this narcotics team that they believe the shit that comes out of them?

*Edit: The ONLY reason these crooked cops were caught was because they were shot. Now, if Gamaldi and Acevedo truly cared about justice and keeping the peace, they'd praise anyone willing to shoot criminals wearing uniform."

I'm not off. Already we see Trump stretching the powers of the executive branch with the undying support of the Republican-held Senate. He's used emergency funding for a wall while the midwest was flooding, he's killing high value targets (Iran) without going through Congress, and the political Right is willing to throw everything they've got in the way of anyone stopping the office of the presidency from becoming the opposite of what this country was founded on. 

Now, imagine a Democrat president after a 2nd term of Trump. Imagine a majority Democrat Senate to go with it. How much built up animosity would it take for them to turn things upside down and run things at even more extreme levels? We're only a stock market crash away from going from flipping like GW to Obama, only this time Democrats will have some pent up ideas for radical change."

The main reason for their significance is the massive disenfranchisement of millions of Americans in the coasts. 

What I mean to point out is there are millions of conservatives in California who want their votes to count. Millions of liberals in Texas who want their votes to count. 

Why are we emphasizing so much speculation and campaigning in the meth belt? GM isn't coming back. We're not building fridges there again. They need to realize their golden age is never coming back. Any candidate from either party is full of shit if they say they can improve the midwest. No one wants to invest in a money pit.

Your approach shouldn't always be about what people's worth is to you. It's egotistical any way you spin it. Don't close yourself off. Be vulnerable and good things will come eventually. Otherwise you'll be stuck with what you have and that's all you're gonna get out of life."
