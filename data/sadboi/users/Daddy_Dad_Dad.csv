SuicideWatch,ffesyep,t3_et1lgt,1579864048.0,"I feel suicidal a lot of the time. I am older than you though at 42. I have been to so many doctors/specialists/counsellors you name it.

I have a ton of diagnosis with some assessments coming up.

Diagnosed: Hashimoto thyroiditis, ADHD, Bipolar 
(I only got these diagnosis in the last two years).

I am now going to be assessed for ASD in July.

When I was a kid my dad used to beat the shit out of me. My mom enabled him. They frequently told me that I was a fucking piece of shit and they wished they never had me.

I crashed out of university because of drugs and alcohol problems which continued throughout my 20’s and 30’s.

I recently quit smoking.
I quit drinking too.
I haven’t taken any (non prescribed!) drugs in five years.

I finished qualifying as an actuary seven years ago through distance learning. When I feel really shit I look at the certificate on the wall to remind myself what I can achieve.

I have no job at the moment and no benefits so I still struggle a lot. I can’t afford my medication.

This morning I lost it and screamed at my children and pushed over my wife. This happens sometimes ... the doctors don’t know why.

It happens at my kids school I screamed at his teacher and I can’t hold down a job in my chosen field because of these anger behaviour patterns.


So ... why am I telling you this?

datascience,fcagmxe,t3_egtwll,1577568893.0,"Hello there,
Congratulations on deciding on your path in life.

It’s tricky to answer your question fully without knowing a bit more about your background.

You say you are new to Data Science but then want to do some data analysis projects (quick ones). I think a distinction may be useful. What do you understand by these terms?

For me they are kind of equally meaningful/meaningless but the market tends to segment the former to include machine learning / programming etc.. while the latter can be simpler tools and concepts.

I suggest that, however, for both you need some statistics and visualisation as well as the ability to “assess” a data set for useful basic information.

I will assume you are starting here - if not let me know and we can start you further along. I am also assuming you want a job in industry rather than academia so again please say if not.

All this said here is a really dull answer for you that will serve you well.

Ignore *all* of the hype.

Download a copy of Microsoft Excel and get yourself a basic stats book (A-level S1/S2 are fine to start).

Learn how to use Excel’s statistics and data manipulation ability (or numbers or google sheets if you prefer ... companies use Microsoft a lot though).

Get good at basic visualisation - all of excel charts etc .. set up some spreadsheets showcasing knowledge of summary statistics, correlations, regressions etc.. 


From there you can move to databases for your data using Excel to import (Access to begin, you can do SQL server later). 

In great news both Access and Excel can easily read .CSV which is one of the most common data formats.

When you have mastered these PowerBi should be your next port of call but by now you should definitely have enough on your CV to get a position in a company - now you get paid to learn. 

From there take your path whichever way you like ... now you are *in*.

I worked in London’s finance district as an actuary for over 15 years ... every single company uses Excel. Every. Single.One. They will continue to do so - legacy systems cost to migrate.

This may be the dullest answer you receive so my apologies for this. It is, however, both pragmatic and practical.

Hope this helps."

datascience,fbkxpiu,t3_edtagd,1576956362.0,"I think that with any career choice the best mindset is a ""growth"" one to paraphrase Ms. Dweck.

Things change - lately they change fast and often. A base level of mathematics and decent understanding of coding structures and databases structure/query language will carry you a long way technically. Languages come in and out of fashion - the structure stays the same.

The only thing that will secure your future employability though is adaptability and a willingness to learn every day of every year for the rest of your life.

To figure out \*what\* you should be learning is a different matter. I suggest staying on top of the current stack at your employment with one eye on the gartner report and emerging technologies for your ""side learning"".

At some point you will want to learn about softer skills in terms of sales and communication and people skills for managing teams so target some learning here when it feels right.

Do this and you are golden :)

csharp,f8lg46i,t1_f8l59ih,1574621925.0,Thanks for the tip. I had thought about investment banking - I did C++ at uni but haven’t really used it since. I thought that Python was where investment banks were heading. From what I can see in job ads C# is what the hedge funds seem to be using. As a dev yourself do you have any specific advice for me if I wanted to go this way? Thanks by the way.
csharp,f8kg64g,t1_f8k4cz3,1574610828.0,Very much so - In fact that’s pretty much where I want to head with this. Have to get the bills paid though!!
csharp,f8jyevb,t1_f8jvhtx,1574605489.0,Thought about this but would prefer dev.
csharp,f8ja1t5,t1_f8j9m67,1574597751.0,Can you expand on “shouldn’t have an issue”? Should I just apply to these companies? Send a github etc.. I would love to be one of these rare and desirable beasts!!! Mind me asking if this is WTW or a different firm? And are you hiring!!?
csharp,f8j9njl,t3_e0vu8x,1574597588.0,"Thanks for the advice mate!

I would love to learn from you but there are some great tips. 

I don’t do linked in but I think the key messages are to get building and put a github together?

I’m taking a Udemy front end course zero to webmastery so that will get me started on front end hopefully.

Is it worth putting a link to my github on my cv? Do you know any decent recruiters in London or am I better off trying to go direct?"
csharp,f8j71kq,t1_f8ibcfo,1574596807.0,Thanks! I’m just tired of life insurance. Hope yours goes well too - are you London based?
csharp,f8j5ylf,t1_f8io8az,1574596495.0,"Great advice here thank you! I found a “tournament tracker” video on YouTube I am working through so will put that on git along with my certification exercises for now.

I have heard of Xamarin but was thinking of going ASP.NET?

Your thoughts on meet-up are good I should do this.

£25k though!!! Ouch!! I was hoping for something closer to £40k"
csharp,f8j5fwx,t1_f8icdu4,1574596300.0,I have applied to here! The comment on the city is good advice too. I think trying to get a job in development in my “domain area” would be good. After 18 years of insurance I guess I’m itching to get new industry experience but there is some good advice here - leverage what you know.
raisedbynarcissists,f7uijde,t1_f7uek08,1574015109.0,Thank you for your understanding. I should read the rules but FYI my other favourite group is r/ADHD ... thanks though I will do these things in future. You’re a good person.
raisedbynarcissists,f7u41th,t1_f7u24ts,1574010365.0,Ok - what’s the protocol to report. My life is completely messed up last thing I need is people asking me to explain this to them.
raisedbynarcissists,f7u3edf,t1_f7u1r1g,1574010130.0,Done.
raisedbynarcissists,f7t91gd,t1_f7t7zdn,1574001992.0,I am being extremely hostile?? You don’t know me. I asked a question about a shitty situation that happened to me and far from helping this fucking forum has enraged me. Fuck all of you people.
