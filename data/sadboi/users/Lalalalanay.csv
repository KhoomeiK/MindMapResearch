Gifted,fr58cmr,t1_fr4tu6d,1589904272.0,"Yes of course lol!

It’s called “pregnancy brain” then “mom brain” for slang terms idk if you have heard those before.

Once a woman gets pregnant, the bodies hormone levels change drastically. Anxiety is also higher, stress as well not to mention lack of sleep are factors too I’d imagine. There is a hormone specifically designed to loosen joins so the body can expand along with the fetus. My jaw is actually lose on one side from this!

It’s just a recipe for forgetfulness. Mine fluctuates honestly but for the most part is so bad. I have taken up more reading and that’s improved it slightly I just have to really stick to it. Before I never had to write anything down ever. I could remember numbers and sequences and recite them even a month later. Now I can’t remember a simple phone number.

I have observed, I remember everything related to my child and so I’m guessing my brain just doesn’t have enough space for other things it declares unimportant. I’d imagine it’s the same for other moms. Our brain rewires what decides, what goes in the trash and what gets kept.

Also, that change happens forever and the further along pregnancy, the more so you are affected. Of course some are not affected at all so it’s really fascinating!

I think if it as a second brain development. Kids and children are also bombarded with hormones and are so overloaded with info. They get frustrated really quickly. Same with pregnancy!

I have actually been pregnant twice but the first did not make it. The first time I was pregnant, I fractured my hand on a car window from just an overflow of hormones and emotions I literally had to punch something. 2nd pregnancy was not as bad mentally at first since I had already been through it, but since I made it the whole pregnancy, I was mentally *and* physically affected much more.

The human body is so fucking cool!!"
Gifted,fr4tikw,t3_gmo2wy,1589896570.0,"I get this a lot with books around people. I went to a bookstore with friends a year ago and I had already read the first page of about 5-6 books and decided I didn't want to read them within the first 5 minutes. They were all still on the first! I had picked out the book I wanted within 15 minutes but they need an extra 30.

I get this a lot too when people show me stuff. I can kind of ""scan"" it and pick out the important bits rather quickly. I get ""wow you read that already"" a lot when really I just somehow picked out what I needed rather quickly. Unsure how to explain that part lol

I also do a lot of math in my head. Even with equations and that usually shocks people. I kinda just look up, figure it out, then I have the answer. And I have a tendency to move rather quickly through subjects and theories and all types of things while everyone around me is still a little behind on stuff or figuring out things.

I have super poor memory since I was pregnant by the way so I doubt I can be really considered gifted anymore. I was labeled by my school in 2nd grade, but I do not think I ever took an official test. They did have me in a special group for gifted students that was suppose to help us with the social aspect of being ahead and helped study skills for about a year but then I switched schools.

They also did our testing in the group, because we would all be done in about half the time the next student would finish in the regular class. Then we would do experiments or read together and stuff like that. That was really fun honestly I wish it was more prevalent in the school system today."

Coronavirus,fqpvgrf,t3_gk7521,1589554713.0,"Japan is very cohesive and individuality is not as celebrated in japan as it is in other countries. Less stress from jobs is a factor as some have pointed out but, people are able to do more hobbies and explore more of their individuality or even they have more time to enjoy simple things even. Also getting more sleep! Japanese are also super punctual and punctuality can determine how other people see you for the rest of your life. They now don’t have as much stress on attendance. Especially around punctuality. They don’t have as long of a commute. 

I don’t think it has to do with stress of the job as much, as just free time in general!

The thing was, we could not give away free stuff so customers would hate us but love management so of course we would get treated like shit all the time by customers.

Management also did not care about people’s schedules. Despite being a “flexible” job. They would constantly schedule people over their plans, and we would have to find someone to cover it which would always happen. It happened so much, we are positive the manager was purposefully scheduling us over our plans.

I usually closed but I would conveniently get scheduled Monday mornings *after* I told her about it. The first two I didn’t get scheduled over because she didn’t know about them.

I loved my coworkers. I dare say, best coworkers ever. I also loved decorating cakes. I was not an official decorator but I got to do simple words or designs, and I also fixed cakes that would occasionally be messed up.

Something that’s often forgotten is when this will happen, her hormones will snap back so all of this will apply for a few weeks even. Just dont let her carry the burden alone."

Survival,fpssvzu,t1_fpmi1v2,1588879059.0,I read it as it’s a natural fiber with probably a natural wax. Versus a synthetic fiber that is often used. It would be more difficult to make synthetic fibers than natural ones. That’s what I got from it though.
ffx,fpsajkp,t1_fps1n6d,1588870220.0,I’d definitely think so. It’s crazy though I didn’t think of that while playing. I think that makes seeing this picture more special though
COVID19,fprv2gn,t3_gez04o,1588862598.0,I’m curious. A month ago it was circulating the ibuprofen maxes the symptoms worse. Is ibuprofen a blood thinner? Is it better now? Is it blood thinning via a specific method?
JustUnsubbed,fpruyc3,t3_gethx8,1588862535.0,I downvoted most of those. Considering unfollowing myself. I was there for countries other than the US. It’s bad enough living here and everything is elf-absorbed as it is.

peopleofwalmart,fpq8v3y,t1_fpq6ifs,1588817528.0,Nice. Also appreciate the harassing messages. I’ll leave you to wallow. I hope your day or life gets better so you don’t feel the need to spread so much damn hate over someone having a children.
7seeds,fpq7roa,t3_gc65ht,1588816877.0,"I was waiting to finish the manga but I have a few chapters left. 

This is the most well written manga/story I have read in a very long time. My favorite part is how true to each personality everyone is throughout but they also grow in a very organic way. It caused me to be much more attached to each character and I wish it could go on longer.

My favorite arc has to be ryugu shelter but also sado. Sado because it feels like characters are wrapping up nicely. I did expect a more main death but I also can’t decide who’d I want to die lol. I did wish there was more conflict or more love triangle stuff between Hana, Arashi and Aramaki but at the same time, perhaps that would have overdone the story. I also didn’t realize it was a shoujo until after I looked up the manga and I was surprised. It has a great amount of action! 

My only thing I would have changed is the moment Hana goes to tell semimaru about ango and he stops her. I feel like she would have told him at that moment anyways, but semimaru would have made a more wise comment or would of been one to “understand” ango a little better I guess. Not give him an excuse, just understand the “bad” in him I guess I am trying to say? 

Either way, I am really happy with how stuff is turning out and I love the minor twists here and there. 

I hope I will be able to find a manga that is so well written with a great balance of action and romance. I like a little romance but with so many anime’s it will come out of no where or just be annoying I guess. 

I hope they do another season of the anime too! It doesn’t have quite as much but they are doing an amazing job keeping up with the manga and catching key points. Cheers!"

Not a single mom just an essential worker working 10 hour shifts with an essential worker boyfriend who have to work opposite hours and Walmart no longer opens at night so hours are limited. While I would love to not go, assholes decided to wipe the shelves and continue to do so I cannot stock up on food thus needing to go more. 
Otherwise nothing. You clearly don’t know what you are talking about and I only hope you self quarantine just to keep that nastiness to yourself. 

Ignorance is one hell of a virus

Also, are you that wrapped in your own world you can’t seem to grasp others may lead a life different than yours? Just tragic."

relationship_advice,fppox4k,t3_gemawy,1588806330.0,Initially I would say it depends if it’s a one time statement or if he knew it was racist. But I saw someone else’s comment where they said something he said to you and yes girl I’m glad you did. It was clearly said with malicious intent. Sorry people are rude and mean and I hope you are doing okay.

peopleofwalmart,fppkxf0,t1_fppd4hk,1588804188.0,Have you tried putting a mask on a child??? My child lasts a few minutes then takes it right off. We got through the process of putting it on and she takes it off at least 20+ times through our trip. The longest she kept it was 10 minutes and it was only because other people were wearing one
AskReddit,fppanq3,t1_fpp9o1i,1588798855.0,Exactly. It’s better to buy from companies who are actually trying to change the problem so it’s not a problem. Not ignore it so they can make a buck off of people’s conscious
AskReddit,fpp935o,t1_fpo8ry6,1588798072.0,"The downside to this is, these children use these jobs to feed families so by doing this, you are essentially taking money away from these kids. Companies like Estée Lauder have programs that not only offer schooling for kids for when they get older, but they have been slowly wedging themselves into the mining business so they can either

a. Make them more safe 

b. Get the kids other/better jobs

I think instead, it’s a good idea to support businesses who are actually trying to help instead of avoiding the problem all together."

AskWomen,fpmdafn,t3_ge1tsm,1588730574.0,"Ugh yes. My friends brother. We just “click” on every level. But our other friend who is friends with his sister, have history and I just felt odd about being friends with his sister *and* someone he has history with. She(the girl he has history with)  also never got over him and is fully in love with him but he is not to her. Because of all of the potential drama I never pursued. 

He asked me out once but after I declined and he was very hurt. We didn’t talk for a year and he even deleted all of his social media. I think he got very depressed. His sister (also my friend) would joke about how in love he was with me. Never told him that I liked him though and I never will. 

I now have an awesome family and boyfriend so when me and the brother are around each other, we really keep our distance :/ sucks but it is what is best for both of us and our situations. Plus I am genuinely happy where I am in life now. :)

Also, I’ve been friends with all of them for over 8 years now. I really value those friendships and I don’t think, no matter what happens, that I would pursue in the future either"
houseplants,fphpxyh,t1_fphof9f,1588625662.0,It sucks :( The rest are fine so for whatever reason most of the disinfectant seems to be getting on this one. I usually have it a little better by Friday but the fog happens again and I’m back to square one
houseplants,fphnh5n,t3_gdjhp2,1588624385.0,"Since this whole coronavirus stuff started we started getting this “fog” service where they disinfect the whole place. It’s not suppose to be harmful to plants. There is another plant near it but it is further to the corner. This one seems to need a little extra drink but that’s it. 

The fog happens over the weekend while I’m away. Would it be safe to cover it with a garbage bag? Should I put extra water? I don’t want to risk overwatering though I just don’t know what to do!"
