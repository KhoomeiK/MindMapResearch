i took 247-248 last year (and wrote a post about how terribly organized it was about a year ago in this subreddit). i didn’t take 249 (thad walker taught it, and my friends who took it that semester said it was more or less just as bad and disorganized as 247/8); i took 311 last fall instead, and 322 this spring. i was originally planning to major in physics but i have been very frustrated with every professor i’ve had in the department, and prospects don’t look good in upper division courses either, so i’m stopping at the certificate, and physics/ece 235 will be my final physics class most likely. (i considered 241, but the professor who consistently teaches it is also notoriously bad; 205 is supposed to be much better, but they haven’t offered it for like 3 semesters in a row.) also there’s no problem with asking more questions lol"
UWMadison,fn0vlt2,t1_fmyq2f9,1586549606.0,"the first couple weeks of physics 322 are a vector calc crash course/review, because the rest of the class will assume you’re comfortable with vector calc. but you don’t cover vector calc until the middle of math 321 (the course is divided into three units in this order: vector algebra and geometry [harder than you expect], then vector calculus, then complex calculus). so math 321 is more of a class that’s useful, but probably not necessary, to take before physics 322.

math 322’s curriculum lines up quite closely with physics 322’s once you get a little further in from what i’ve heard from others who are in both classes, as far as separation of variables, boundary conditions, sturm-liouville, fourier series... you learn those techniques all in-depth in math 322. you learn them in physics 322 as well, but not quite as in-depth. so it’s a great class to take simultaneously.

tldr: it’s probably most helpful if you treat 322 as an optional *co*-req, and 321 as an optional *pre*-req. it kind of depends on your needs and timing of when you can take stuff as to which is better.

i don’t think vector calc is all that hard personally, and the unit at the start of physics 322 on vector calc was good enough for me, but i have a good intuition for it, so i’m biased. the diffeq stuff is harder for me, so math 322 would’ve been more useful for me."
UWMadison,fmymwul,t1_fmym5jm,1586490106.0,"Okay then those math classes def make sense. math 321/322 help a lot with physics 322 by the way, idk if you’ve taken that yet or not"
UWMadison,fmylr0w,t3_fy723t,1586489261.0,"415 is fall-only i believe btw, so keep that in mind when planning. I heard it wasn’t bad from a random person in one of my discussions last semester, but that was a person who is generally really good at math/physics/etc—however they said other people thought it was relatively easy too. They definitely had not taken 321 (vector calc & complex analysis) or 322 (mostly an intro to PDEs & fourier series as far as I know); I think those two classes deal with pretty separate things from 415, which is why they’re not listed as prereqs. However the only class on that list that i’ve taken is 321, so i can’t say much else about the others.

morbidquestions,fmxgsc1,t1_fmxd1bp,1586464702.0,"from my understanding of it, DID is a response to childhood trauma where a singular cohesive identity never forms, and its job is to protect the person by storing the memories of trauma, etc in separate parts of the brain--separate identities--that are separated by barriers of amnesia (one of the diagnostic criteria for it). a lot of people with DID don't even know that they have it, because it does such a good job of hiding itself from those directly affected, so that they can function in day-to-day life; as a result, it can very easily be invisible to other people as well. it's also incredibly stigmatized due to negative media portrayals and just lack of education, which can make people hesitant to be open about it. you have statistically almost definitely met someone (or maybe many systems) affected by it, but they may not have known it themselves, or they may have chosen not to tell you. i have not met anyone in-person who has told me they have DID, but i have a handful of online friends with it.

there are a lot of excellent educational youtube channels on the subject of DID (made by actual DID systems) dedicated to explaining how life with the disorder works firsthand and breaking down the stigma surrounding it. i highly recommend watching some of them; my favorite channel is DissociaDID, but there are many more like MultiplicityAndMe, TeamPinata, The Entropy System, etc."

I would drop a class but I'm at 13cr and can't go below full time. So im mostly just sitting at home staring at my laptop doing nothing and dissociating.

3 of my classes are doing synchronous lectures and posting recordings later which is nice, I think it's the best way to do online class. All three are using different video conference software (GoToMeeting, Zoom, and BBCollaborate) which is kind of funny but not that big of a deal otherwise. One of my other classes is literally just posting powerpoints and nothing else, no other communication, even though really hard hws are still being assigned as usual, but i don't have any energy to do them.

depressionregimens,fjnniyd,t3_fe45we,1583511059.0,"I've been on Cymbalta/duloxetine since October I think (so 4-5 months ago) and it is helping me enormously for the most part, after trying 3 SSRIs that didn't work and a TeCA that helped but made me sleep 14hrs/day. Currently I take 60mg duloxetine XR in the morning. If I don't eat breakfast before taking it, I usually get rather stomach-twisting nausea for about an hour and a half...but that's just more motivation to eat breakfast and be a little but healthier. I can finally actually wake up in the morning, and I've regained a lot of my excitement and passion for life (not all of it obviously, but that just takes time and therapy to heal I think). Some sexual dysfunction, but I'm ace-spec anyway so it's not a huge deal. It hasn't reduced my ability to love my partner or family/friends or things like that--if anything it has actually increased my ability to love, because I don't have quite as much depression clouding my worldview anymore. Depression has been starting to bring me down again a bit lately but I think that could potentially just be chalked up to this semester being difficult.

I am somewhat worried about the long-term SERT downregulation that ppl are talking about but I don't really know what other option there even is right now for me. As far as I'm concerned, really any antidepressant will probably have less than ideal long term biochemical side effects on signaling pathways in some way or another, but I am positive that I need at least some type of antidepressant in order to function, so I'll take what I can get in terms of balancing short-term efficacy and side effects. For a while I honestly considered going into antidepressant pharmacology research but I don't think medical research is for me. I still am kind of a nerd for drug pharmacology tho."

Makes lecture even more worth going to and being awake for--he delivers his jokes really quickly and deadpan, and then immediately moves on with content while half the class starts laughing and the other half gets confused because they didn't get the joke, and it's kind of amazing. but I digress.) it's definitely hefty work, but the teaching staff make it pretty interesting work imo (however, I'm a probably-biochem-and/or-physics major, so take that with a grain of salt). 109 opened my eyes to the world of chemistry and I actually never planned on taking chemistry afterwards, but it sparked my interest so much that I just jumped into ochem immediately after 109 (and I loved ochem too!). 

I only opened the textbook a couple of times but I can't say i learned much from it; i learned more from online sources like Chem LibreTexts and asking questions during discussion section & lab. i probably should've gone to office hours but I'm a dumb bitch so I didn't. you'll need to buy lab goggles and a lab notebook, but there'll be info about that on canvas and it'll get repeated during the first lecture or three. you also will probably have to buy an online access code for OWLv2 which is basically just the online textbook problem assignment tool that they use, unless they've changed the curriculum substantially from last fall."

(i love u matthew bowman)"

also, a fun prank to play on friends is triple-lofting the bed so that it goes all the way to the ceiling, since the lofting system in Leo is modular and you'll always find someone with spare lofting materials"
unpopularopinion,ewhm279,t1_ewgmuvr,1565412607.0,"i wouldn't say almond milk is ""much better for the environment"" than dairy milk--at least in terms of water consumption, both are extremely intensive, and the vast majority of the US's almonds are grown in California which already struggles with droughts. almond IS much better than dairy in terms of emissions and land use, but I prefer to opt for soy or oat milk personally due to their somewhat lower environmental impacts compared to almond, their better taste (imo), and their nutrition which is better for my needs than almond."

vegan,evzimfm,t1_evzds5u,1564958570.0,"the pizza place i work at (not a chain, but we do like build-your-own personal pizzas) has milk in their dough... you have to pay an extra $2 to get the lowkey nasty gluten-free dough if you want a vegan pizza. Like, literally half of our sauces are vegan (although the vegan ones are basically just tomato sauce, spicy tomato sauce, and garlic oil but whatever it's something) and we have vegan cheese and tofurky sausage as topping options in addition to all the regular veggies, meats, and cheeses. A lot of people who ask if the crust is vegan just get fed up with the fact that you have to pay a completely unnecessary $2 for a shittier crust when the regular crust should in any reasonable world be dairy-free, and a decent amount of them just take the L and either reluctantly order the regular crust or just leave. I don't order pizza from there myself bc it's too expensive & not worth the cost to get the vegan crust even with my employee discount"

I do struggle with accurately estimating the amount of time it takes me to do things, which has made trying to block out my free time a bit difficult, but I think that if I just start trying to do it regularly/every day, my skill will get better with time and I'll start to get into the groove of things.

Forest looks like it could be a really helpful app for me! I think i'll try it. It doesn't have any subscription payments or anything other than the initial purchase, does it?"

I increasingly want that time and season to just be *now*. But I think instead of just waiting around as if it's going to happen eventually, I need to quit fucking around and *make* it happen. Although of course that's easier said than done. I have an addictive personality too, and it usually manifests in social media and social interaction in general and certain maladaptive coping mechanisms for my depression, but I definitely feel the addictive drive in other areas too like you mentioned, particularly substances when they're available to me, so I've sort of avoided trying to acquire any stuff for my own personal use even though I want to sometimes.

My supervisors at work are mostly college-aged are all in classes and have immediate/near-term plans for what they want to do with their life, but my managers are all in their 40s or older and they try to make the best of every day but you can 100% tell that they're lowkey miserable. Same for my coworkers that are like mid-20-somethings and not in college and just work full time, often at 2 or 3 jobs, and just exist to keep making ends meet over and over in an endless cycle. I would hate for my motivation to be ""I don't want to end up like that person"", but that might end up being one of the big kickers for me to get myself back on track. I need something to live for in the long-term, and I couldn't live with myself if all I did was work a kind of dead end job, eat, pay bills, sleep. Like I literally wouldn't be able to live like that. Other human beings are definitely something I want to live for, but all the other people I've met have their own plans for life and are succeeding in college and have futures. Classes are something that keeps me busy and are really good for me because they're cumulative/progressive in nature and keep building and there's always new things to learn and do in a way that repetitive procedural work doesn't really have. Maybe I need a better creative outlet than just making memes? I dunno. I'm rambling but anyway thank you."
