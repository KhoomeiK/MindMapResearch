Assistance,fp1671e,t1_fp14kir,1588225526.0,Im having a hard time getting an exact date from my dad but obviously pre-COVID. but now that you mention that it's a good point. Didn't even think that it may still be around because of everything being closed.
Assistance,fp0xp83,t1_fp0x4cb,1588219290.0,Thanks so much :)
Assistance,fp0wvdv,t1_fp0wtbl,1588218742.0,I've never heard of those groups before?
Assistance,fp0ra3y,t1_fp0r6gq,1588215177.0,"No, they don't feel like it's their fault because ""it shouldn't have been in a black trash bag."""
Assistance,fp0oc9h,t1_fp0nd8d,1588213375.0,"Yeah there's not a doubt in my mind that it's gone. Just sucks because it was seriously 90% of his wardrobe and my parents have the attitude ""just go buy more clothing"" not understanding not everyone has the means to do that. Plus who doesn't look in a huge bag of clothes before they donate them...and it's sentimental to him because he's accumulated everything over years. :/"
relationship_advice,fotnq2v,t1_fotnmn9,1588059779.0,He hasn't asked me to prove his loyalty to him at all. I just want him to feel like he can always trust me and try and show him that.

BPD,foi4h70,t1_foehdob,1587778521.0,Yup I never tell anyone explicitly I have BPD. My boyfriend doesn't even know. I keep it vague by saying I have stronger emotions that are harder for me to cope with than other people. I don't need to hear I'm sick every time I get upset about something reasonable. At that point it would be like I'm not allowed have any emotions at all.
BPD,flf41nc,t1_flf3tqs,1585097580.0,That makes so much sense. I've never heard anyone phrase it like that. But it makes sooooooooo much sense
BPD,flec7x1,t1_fle6y8e,1585081581.0,Is it okay if I message you directly?
BPD,fle52m4,t1_fle4nc0,1585077742.0,"So proud of you!! I really really hope everything turns out well for you :) remember you're not a shit person, and be totally honest with your therapist because they're there to help you :)

Edit: also it's a process, so don't get down on yourself if you feel like you're not getting ""better"" quick enough but still try and hold yourself accountable. Just wanted to add that!"
depression,fldwjqd,t3_fnwfip,1585073107.0,"You're not broken. And contrary to popular belief you don't have to be ""whole"" to find someone who you feel like makes your life better.

Don't expect anyone to fill that void but it doesn't mean you can't love someone. You're sad. You have a mental illness. You are not in any way broken. Your first priority should be to take care of yourself but please don't think that means you can't be loved."
BPD,fldvjs9,t3_fo8jwx,1585072541.0,This post is 110% how I've been feeling. From your SO to everything else. I'm so so sorry you're going through this. I don't really have any advice but you are not in the least bit alone. If you want to talk please feel free to message me. :) I could use it too tbh. It's scary for everyone but the mental illness part is really shitty.
BPD,flduvaf,t1_flducc3,1585072166.0,Dude. Every part of this is me. I also suck at comforting people cus I have nooooo clue what to say or do and then feel like an asshole for that. And other times I'm cold af but it depends on the situation. Thank you for responding tho cus I've been struggling with all of this recently.
BPD,fldt1yf,t3_fo5k0h,1585071150.0,"In the past I have been abusive to my friends out of anger and more recently been abusive (verbally) to my boyfriend out of anger. I'm sure you know you can't erase something once it's said and if you're anything like me it's like your anger takes complete control. You have to acknowledge how you've been hurtful and the really change your behavior you need therapy. If you can't afford it (which I totally get) there are DBT and self-help books you can get but you have to commit to being better. I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. It sucks for whoever you're hurting but I'm sure it sucks for you as well, emotionally speaking. In moments of anger though for me it really helps to just leave. Walk away. Whatever. Remind yourself you don't want to be hurtful and just talk to yourself in any rational way you can come up with. I hope everything works out for you :)"
BPD,fldr8t0,t1_fldpfe0,1585070149.0,I feel like my feelings are more intense overall and also in regards to other people. I didn't mean to sound like a jerk but in my own experience it sucks to be told I can't see anything from anyone else's perspective because I do. :/
