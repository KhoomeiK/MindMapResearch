unpopularkpopopinions,fnckv73,t3_g0p464,1586839357.0,"I think it's important to recognize and respect that K-Pop, along with other Asian pop industries, started as a way to bring the spotlight to talented Asians who don't get that type of recognition in other countries.

I also think, as an Asian, that limiting artists who want to be involved in the K-Pop community does no good.  I, for one, would like to see all types of Asian pop music mesh with the Western music industry, and this idea of keeping everything super separate is not going to allow that to happen. I think we've gotten some really amazing crossovers from Western artists and K-Pop groups and I think limiting these interactions or limiting idols' ethnicities would limit this from happening.

Is it likely a non-Asian will become a K-Pop star or involved in the Korean music scene in any way? No. But there's certainly no harm in trying and there's no harm in letting Korean/Asian pop music mesh with the rest of the world."

AsianBeauty,fn0no6i,t3_fy8wwd,1586545295.0," 

Hi, I'm new to this community and hoping to get some help.

I used to have combination skin in my teens. I used to use regular moisturizers and not have an issue.  
Over time I kept upgrading to moisturizers more suited for dry skin since I saw my skin gradually stop producing as much sebum. I'm in my early 20's now and use [Clinique Moisture Surge Intense](https://www.sephora.com/product/moisture-surge-intense-for-very-dry-to-dry-combination-skin-P302901) as a daily moisturizer as well as [The Face Shop Rice Bran All-In-One Cleanser](https://ca.naturecollection.com/en/rice-water-bright-rice-bran-all-in-one-cleanser.html). This used to be an amazing combo for my skin but for the past few months it's just not working anymore. My skin is so incredibly dry and itchy and looks dull. Even using the Laneige Water Sleeping Mask overnight doesn't help because my skin sucks it up in 15 minutes. There's not really many heavier moisturizers that I can find so I'm wondering if it's possible to somehow get my skin to start producing sebum again?

I'm not the most hydrated person in the world but I'm drinking around the same amount of water so I don't think my skin is dehydrated, I'm also unemployed due to COVID-19 so I'm asking here for product/routine/any recommendations because I really don't have much money to be buying new products left and right. I can tell the level of dryness is doing damage to my skin and my forehead and cheeks have even developed some of what I assume to be keratosis pillaris. I have been trying to exfoliate to get rid of the bumps but that makes my skin even more dry and irritated so I'm really at a loss of what to do. Any help is appreciated."
SkincareAddiction,fmzpvpw,t1_fmzpkje,1586526968.0,Okay! I'm pretty sure I've seen the CeraVe one near me so I'll look into picking that up.  I also have an oil cleanser also from the Face shop that I generally only use to take off my makeup first; would using that every day in combination with the CeraVe one be beneficial? Or just stick to the CeraVe one only if I'm not wearing makeup? Thanks!
