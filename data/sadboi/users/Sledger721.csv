What I realized over time was that knowing what to constrain was what was truly important, not constraining myself on theory (things such as going off the beatgrid, using non-diatonic chords, wacky ass chord voicings that take me 5 minutes and a piece of scrap paper to figure out the real names of, etc.) but constraining myself on VSTs/timbres in play really was what got my creativity flowing.
