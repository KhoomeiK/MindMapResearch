I’m not going to say it was easy, but she stuck by my side when I fucked up a few times. She had never used dope and didn’t understand my desire for it, but understood how addiction can take over. It did cause some problems later in our relationship because she wouldn’t let me handle the money even after I was clean and she was very paranoid of any person from my past. Give him a chance.

Almost right away, I wanted to shoot again, but didn’t wanna have to deal with scarring up my arms in the summertime. It just started getting cold enough for sweater here and I picked up a pin and injected 1 bag to start (I usually snort 2 or 3 at a time) but was super disappointed. I didn’t feel like I got as high as I do with snorting and I missed the drip, the taste. If I would’ve gotten higher I would have switched in a second.

I stopped buying the shit about a year ago. I paid for clothing that I never received and settled for patterns I didn’t like bc my consultant played favorites and pushed me around. She would let me claim something and then when i went to pay she would tell me that someone else claimed before I did. I also was practically cyber bullied when I sold a dress that was gently used and mailed it to a woman in TX. She didn’t receive my package bc it was lost or perhaps stolen? She started posting all over different sites calling me a thief even though I gave her money back, but she refused to start a PayPal (this was a few years ago before you had a bunch of cash app options) account and I had to mail her a check. She also had a bunch of her friends and family reach out to me sending me harassing emails and messages and posting everywhere about me. My ordeal was not nearly anywhere near yours, but I understand the petty nature of these people. And their prices?! Ridiculous!! Did you even make any money?

The real problem is that his soon to be ex wife never fought with him because she didn’t care enough to and when they fought there was always the divorce threat.

You might want to also see a therapist, but a therapist cannot diagnose any mental illnesses. 
Before I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and PTSD, my illness started with just the thought of self harm and eventually led me into hurting myself and attempting suicide.
