BipolarReddit,f9cnwbk,t3_e4hrrm,1575225627.0,"I'll preface this with saying that I'm reevaluating a lot of how I act right now, so 6 months from now this answer may be entirely inaccurate. I've also never had a truly healthy relationship (even the one that lasted 4.5 years), and I haven't been on a formally agreed upon date for quite a while.

I classify and compartmentalize the people in my life based on how much I value them and how much I think they can hurt me. I'm going to try to establish myself as a real human being before I introduce anything that lets you reduce me to a stigmatized label. I'm OK being ""CS major, fantasy nerd, gamer, 6'1"", wavy brown hair, likes Chinese food."" I'm not OK being ""Bipolar,"" and that's it. I'm not OK being reduced to my other diagnoses. I don't want you to fix me or fear me. I want to have a good idea of you and for you to have a good idea of me before I give you ammunition to hurt me. This might take a few dates. I'm not gonna give full disclosure immediately, but I'm not going to wait until you accidentally see me in a bad spot. I don't have any hard fast rules to offer - I haven't developed and tested them, and what works for me might not work for you."

Tbh we had some good times so it's not so much thinking about fucking her that's painful, it's after I nut and the fap-guilt sets in. I have loved several women, and this basically applies to them all: reminisce while I jack it, then lie back, think of how I fucked it up, and hate myself. Just got dumped again so I've half a mind to say ""Fuck this No-Nut November shit"" and beat myself to a pulp looking at her profile pic."

LifeProTips,f6vdrf1,t3_dt366p,1573183373.0,"I get stomach trouble all the time. I am never without ginger ale, saltines, and Gatorade. I also saw someone plug rehydration powder - I keep that on hand too in case I'm really a mess or a friend crashes and has a hangover. Also have NyQuil and DayQuil (fighter of the NyQuil), as well as Delsym (kickass cough suppressant). Don't like suppressing a cough but if I have an event (bought it so I didn't disrupt a wedding) or have to work, I better not be coughing all the time.

I'm basically a low-key prepper. I keep a pretty well-stocked medicine cabinet (in the kitchen, because pills melt in the bathroom) and bandage kit. I carry some of the same stuff in my EDC backpack. A friend was once astonished that I carried bandages when I cut my hand open at a restaurant - I don't know why more people don't."

What works for me now is getting organized - I make study plans wherein I estimate how long things will take, write down due dates, meticulously break down what needs to be done to simple actions. If I cut it down to pieces, it's not so mysterious and scary. But that's hard to do if you're paralyzed already.

As for getting out of paralysis, I didn't figure that out for a long time. I didn't figure it out at all - I learned coping skills with a therapist. I'd offer specifics but I am not sure if I'm allowed to do that here. If you've done any CBT or DBT or ACT, now would be the time to use those skills."
