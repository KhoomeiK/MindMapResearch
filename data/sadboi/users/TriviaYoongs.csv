I'll have to sit on your post for a while.... I think you're right in every way. I needed to hear all this.

The overwhelming amount of people who have given me advice on this topic have really made me rethink doing anything like cursing. He isn't worth the energy, right? I should use it to heal myself. To finally give myself some rest... I deserve that. My child self deserves that.

I'm currently not in therapy but I hope one day I will be able to finally talk about this face to face... It will take a while but it's one step at a time, right? :)

I couldn't thank you enough for this. I'm not quite sure on what magic-related action I'm going to take but I have to trust myself to make the right decision.

But for now I'm working on doing mundane things like unfollowing, removing pictures, etc. and of course the most important one: not initiating contact. + Making conversation with him to the bare minimum when I do have to see him. That's, sadly, the best I can do.

And... wow. That's a really good suggestion actually... I'll look into it! Thank you so much.

WitchesVsPatriarchy,flysde3,t1_flq1x41,1585608147.0,"You couldn't have put it into words better. 

I am planning on taking distance from him. I've unfollowed him on all his social media accounts (sounds silly- I never even see his posts really but it's still something that connects me to him.) , and I deleted a message I sent him earlier to 'call me back' for unrelated reasons... I've changed his contact name, will soon put all his photos into a different map, etc etc etc. and of course the biggest one, I will not initiate contact, ever.

I can't help seeing him in many situations but I have no intention of making conversation with him.. Any other suggestions?

Maybe I needed to hear that... That there's a possibility he isn't even thinking about this anymore. It was indeed very much about power. He could have done it to anyone else but of course he did it to the youngest girl he knew... Part of me wishes I would have told someone. Maybe he would have gotten what he deserves... I should indeed trust that the world will take care of it, though. 

I hope I can someday talk to a therapist about this- I'm sure it would help a lot.

That has really changed things. I need to be more kind to that little girl.

But, because of all your support I've decided not to do it. The outcome is way too uncertain and I'll probably just end up hurting myself in the progress... Thank you for your advice :)

Currently there are no children around him. The fact that they don't stop at one victim is one of the scariest thoughts that cross my mind. I don't know if... he's done this to anyone else. I really, really hope not.

He's getting married soon (I'm definitely gonna break down at the wedding. Yikes) and then eventually they would want kids but I don't see him as someone who would do this to his own kids. (I don't see him as the kind of person who would do this shit at ALL, but..... yeah.)

WitchesVsPatriarchy,flpv51i,t1_flptvq8,1585369723.0,"That’s a really good quote to keep in mind. I’d never heard of it before. I know that witchcraft can backfire majorly but I somehow also believe that if I believe in something strongly enough it will go the way I want it to go.... though that’s probably not the truth. 

I’m not necessarily new to witchcraft- I’ve been studying it for a good few years but still I find myself struggling with ‘ethical’ questions like this.

And I believe you when you say I could very well Accidentally ‘ruin his life.’ 
I said I wanted to do a karma spell but I guess someone’s ‘life being ruined’ is very subjective, so while this feels like the end of the world to me (and it doesn’t necessarily hinder or mess with many other opportunities of mine) it might as well ruin all HIS opportunities to achieve the same amount of grief. (If that makes sense?)
Do you agree? 

And I want to believe u/blueconlan with all my heart but it’s so difficult. I’ve been struggling with this for years, all on my own. I feel like I’ve gone through so much torture but it hasn’t brought me anywhere. I feel like I can’t talk about it to anyone else... so what options are left? Ahh im sorry I don’t mean to throw a pity party. 

And yeah, I think my desire to do any sort of witchcraft to change this situation is definitely about wanting control, you’re right. I feel like control has been taken away from me by him. 

I hope I can some day muster up the courage to talk to someone about this face to face.... thank you for saying I deserve peace. It really means a lot to me. I can’t thank you enough. 
You seem like someone whose advise I should take seriously. 

Bless you 🥺💓"

I’ll take your advice and think about it first. I am indeed very conflicted and I really shouldn’t do any work before my mind has cleared up a bit.... it’s just so difficult.

The thing is: there was a YEAR in between his second to last video (giving the people what they want) and his coming out video.... which was NINE months ago. I understand the covid-19 would limit online time but to my knowledge he wasn't online much (even on twitter) long before that time... I just wonder what he's working on... And if he's ever coming back. Honestly doesn't seem like it to me.... :(

I could understand taking a break but this is lasting nearly 2 years now... I wonder how he's sustaining himself! Surely Phils 400 k views per video every 2 weeks couldn't be enough? He (they?) even went to Japan together (I believe) so I guess Phil must be working aside from his yt channel.

selfharm,fgoutjw,t1_fgexk4u,1580987620.0,"Perhaps. Most of the cuts that keep reopening are ones that were down to fat. 

And I see! I thought you put it on and then LEFT it on for 12 hours or so- that's what I did. I haven't made very deep ones since this post so I haven't been wearing bandages at all- its much more comfortable WITH them but if they keep reopening...

Thank you so much! :D"
Spells,fge6hlw,t1_fg523go,1580692473.0,"That's really cool!

Thank you so much. I'll definitely try this one out tonight! Maybe it will help with my insomnia."
selfharm,fge6c7n,t1_fg51fyn,1580692373.0,"That's a really good idea, actually. 

I saw the notification of your comment right when you posted it, and kept it in mind ever since. That being said, the razors came in and thankfully no one asked any questions! They didn't open the package."
selfharm,fge690d,t1_fg4o8tr,1580692311.0,Thank you for the advice! :D
selfharm,fge4c6a,t3_exwh9w,1580691080.0,"It makes sense. It clearly meant a lot to you. It's okay to feel bad.

I'm sorry you had to lose your worlds. I hope you're okay :( <3"
selfharm,fge45d9,t1_fgdh23t,1580690954.0,"I have a question- when you put the cotton on and you have to take it off- how do you take it off without completely ripping off your scab? I've covered a cut from two days ago twice and both times it reopened. I just took it off (ouch) and it has started bleeding a lot again! It's far from heavy bleeding but I've sat here for I think 15 minutes and a drop of blood still comes down every minute or so.

Thanks lots! <3"
selfharm,fge3v0m,t1_fgcwnpe,1580690756.0,I agree but please don't use toilet paper! It rips very easily and tiny bits could get in the wound.
selfharm,fge3sq2,t1_fgcdir4,1580690713.0,"Please don't put your shirt down. It's very prone to infection that way, and from what I've seen, its not something you want to experience. 

Please go to the dollar store and buy steristrips/medical tape , gauze and compress gauze.

When it's done bleeding, either use steristrips to close the wound or cut medical tape up to replicate steristrips. 

Put the compress on it and wrap it with the gauze. You can also keep it to your skin by taping the compress.

If you'd disinfect them it would be even better, but I'm not very knowledgeable on that front."
selfharm,fge30ee,t3_exx3s1,1580690197.0,Haven't experienced it from a customer-commenting on my self harm standpoint- but I understand that it made you uncomfortable. I'm glad they were at least nice about it. I hope you're okay.
selfharm,fge2vp5,t3_exu0l2,1580690113.0,"I haven't done that personally, but I understand. 

But please be careful with doing that! Dont be too hard on yourself. Lots of love <3"

witchcraft,fg4zk3f,t3_ews7w2,1580514674.0,"Sorry- I'm only here to add another question! :)

Any ideas on spells/rituals for my brother who is getting married? Nothing to interfere directly with their marriage, but something 'passive' , I guess. Thank you!

Congratulations on getting married. I'm sure it will be lovely <3"
selfharm,fg21b8z,t3_ewdsmx,1580436378.0,"I would say: talk about things you’re comfortable talking about with your parents. It’s okay to not be ready to tell your parents things. It should all come at its own time. 

I think it’s great you’re getting help. Good luck, I’m sure it will be okay :)"
