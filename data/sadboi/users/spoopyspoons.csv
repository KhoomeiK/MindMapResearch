People that have been through similar struggles are more likely to empathize with us and who doesn’t love a lil empathy? It’s so refreshing when people just get it and you don’t have to explain everything.

The magnetic thing can be pretty weird but I just chalk it up to intuition. We pick up on a collection of tiny cues that, in summation, give us the feeling of knowing something without consciously processing it. Your subconscious mind is much more powerful than most people give it credit for - it can process information very quickly and accurately. I think it’s a pretty awesome superpower actually."

BipolarSOs,fpahlxh,t3_gc9vll,1588448342.0,"I have bipolar disorder and I’ve definitely noticed that sleeping can act like a light switch for my mood. Mornings are often the worst part of the day as well, but I‘ve learned that I can do a lot to improve my mood throughout the day. Thinking you’re absolutely powerless to change your mood is a major self-fulfilling prophecy. 

As far as the sleeping in goes, he should try to cut that shit out for his own mental health. Sticking to a regular sleep schedule is really important for us bipolar folks, and the closer it is to our natural circadian rhythms, the better (ie waking up between 6 and 8 am when the sun comes up). I suggest you guys look into interpersonal and social rhythm therapy - it’s specifically designed for bipolar disorder and it’s all about keeping a regular schedule basically. If you can’t afford therapy, you can actually get all the information/handouts from their website IPSRT.org - just register and pretend you’re a clinician and you’ll have access to everything for free within a couple minutes; it’s in a pretty easy to understand format too. 

I’ve also found behavioural activation quite helpful and there’s some overlap with IPSRT. It’s basically tracking your daily activities, recording how your mood changes throughout the day, and scheduling “antidepressant” activities throughout the day once you determine what those are + following through with them even if you don’t really feel like it. For example, I often withdraw socially when depressed even though socializing is a very powerful mood booster for me, so I try to make sure I socialize regularly, telling myself I’ll feel better afterwards, even if I don’t feel like doing it right now. 

Here’s a few more tips from my own experience:
- Make mornings as enjoyable as possible - even better than sleeping. Maybe that means buying some awesome food for breakfast. Maybe that means setting aside an hour of guilt-free video game time before starting the day. Or maybe extra kinky sex. The options are endless. Figure out what motivates him and what he finds enjoyable, even on his darker days, and try to use that to your advantage. 

- sometimes I tell myself “okay, I’m going to do this one thing and then if that improves my mood, I’ll try doing another thing; if not, then I’ll just go back to bed.” Even better if it’s something that will make laying in bed feel better that I should be doing anyway - like getting a bite to eat, taking my dog out or brushing my teeth (fuck fuzzy teeth). Knowing that going back to bed is still an option just seems to make getting up so much easier and most of the time I DO feel better and don’t go back to bed. Maybe start off trying to get him to get up for an hour (maybe less) of quality time/breakfast and tell him he can go right back to bed afterwards. 

- Don’t underestimate the power of sunshine - it seriously makes a huge difference and it’s way more powerful than indoor lights (plus vitamin D what’s up). I used to be constantly in the dark but now that I’ve removed my heavy curtains it’s so much easier to wake up and stay awake. In the winter I use a sunlamp. You can also get alarm clocks that mimic the rising sun. 

- not sure if this will actually work for him but when I’m agitated I try to limit my protein intake so I’m not producing excess norepinephrine/dopamine, which can make you pretty pissy (according to “The Chemistry of Joy”). I also tend to have low blood sugar when I first wake up and having a quick piece of fruit or glass of juice makes me feel a lot better. If I don’t eat within ~2 hours of waking up I can be pretty irritable too. 


None of this is intended to be solely YOUR job, it’s just stuff you can suggest and help with. If he doesn’t seem to care about getting better for his own mental health and your relationship, then don’t bother. You can’t make someone get better or treat you right. I hope he’s willing to change and I hope some of my tips work out for you guys - good luck!"
BipolarReddit,fpab4hr,t3_gc9p3p,1588444499.0,"One time I was part of a conversation in which the other people were discussing someone that had recently been an asshole in a professional setting (apparently this happens regularly/randomly) and someone said “He’s probably bipolar” to explain the behaviour and I straight up said “I’m bipolar. That’s not how it works.”

Definitely made things awkward for a minute and I probably wouldn’t have outed myself in your situation (more afraid of the consequences in a professional setting) but it felt really good to fight the stereotype. I don’t think we can expect anyone to actually understand bipolar disorder, but these casual, judgmental diagnoses of all psychiatric disorders by these “armchair psychologists” should be put to a full fucking stop. THAT shit should be stigmatized, but those that are most impacted by it are unfortunately the least likely to have the strength to fight it.

You probably shouldn’t be on this sub right now. You need to take time to address your trauma and heal.

Other species may very well be smart enough to help others, but the scientific community won’t know for sure until they pass a test like this.

There’s no “right” way to date anyone. Everyone likes to feel appreciated and desired but that doesn’t mean you have to compliment them all the time to accomplish that.

socialanxiety,f7mftm6,t3_dwz21m,1573862144.0,It can take over a year to see one where I live. It depends.
mentalhealth,f7glk9d,t1_f7ghocd,1573707631.0,"I can see how that would be hard to accept. If what she said is true and this is the worst it’s ever been for her though, I don’t think you can really blame her right now. She may take responsibility later - she might not be very rational/socially aware/conscientious right now. She could also be completely consumed with guilt and have no idea of how to confront it. It can be very hard to understand severe depression/anxiety and how badly it alters you, even if you’ve had a mild/moderate case of it, so if that is what’s going on she needs a lot of compassion while you guys figure this out. An incredibly intelligent person might struggle to form a sentence let alone have an entire intellectual conversation. The more unread messages the harder it is to reply so I think it would be good to stop after two messages and try to make them shorter. 

When you talk to her I would say approach it from a place of worry/compassion. Put your ego aside and focus on her and finding out what she’s been going through. Let her know you’ve been doing a little research since she said her mental health was bad and you’d like to understand what she’s been going through better and you want to be there to support her if she’ll let you. Tell her you understand things won’t be the same but she needs to help you adjust to this new situation because you care a lot about her and you were really worried since you didn’t know what was going on. If she still doesn’t get it, gently ask her how she would feel if the roles were reversed. Also ask her how you should respond if she does the same thing in the future and work on revising your communication expectations. 

Honestly this relationship might prove to be too much for you or her. If she is very ill and you choose to continue, make sure you do keep setting boundaries and advocating for yourself. Don’t continue if she isn’t willing to work on getting better or if it’s too much for you. It’s very difficult to be with a mentally ill person if they don’t have healthy ways to cope and you aren’t obligated to help."
mentalhealth,f7fubqj,t3_dvwdeq,1573686934.0,"Not surprised r/relationship_advice suspects cheating but as a person that has dealt with a few years of severe depression while in a relationship, I think depression alone could explain her behaviour. 

(If your girlfriend is having a similar experience) It’s probably very hard for her to articulate herself right now. Conversations in general can be hard as hell - simply speaking or texting feels exhausting and the words just wouldn’t come to me. It felt shitty telling my loved ones I felt like crap over and over again and I would rarely tell them the full extent of it. I felt like they would judge me for not helping myself enough. I felt like I wasn’t worthy of anyone or their help. I felt like a burden that should just hide away. Like it was a matter of time before everyone would find out how much I suck. My brain would relentlessly twist every little thing into something negative somehow, even the most positive, well-intentioned things people would do and say. I felt like a total drag to be around and socializing was pretty painful/barely possible. I self-isolated instead of dealing with the world. My social anxiety would get much worse and I wouldn’t want anyone to look at me, let alone interact with me. When my boyfriend would ask how to help I would never know what to say at the time and I repeatedly thought he would get sick of me and say fuck this. I think your girlfriend is afraid you’re going to ditch her if she reveals exactly how fucked up she is and asks for your help with it.

Maybe don’t check in all the time. It could be an awkward and painful reminder for her. The way she’s speaking to you reminds me a lot of what I was like when I was very bad. I would be most avoidant of the things that were the most important to me. It’s easier to respond to mundane messages and less important people than it is to confront all your fears and guilt with the people that matter to you. Do not keep checking to see if she’s online - live your own life!! Those things can be inaccurate and will only add to your anxiety. 

Research how to be there for a loved one with depression/anxiety, try to understand how it works/what it can be like (experiences vary greatly), be patient as hell, don’t take things personally if you can help it. For your next date, suggest takeout at home and a movie in your PJs. When you’re with her, try to distract her from the depression/anxiety and just help her out with little everyday things she’s probably neglecting that add to the stress, like meal prep and bills.

I’m not sure if this would work for your relationship, but for a time my boyfriend would just show up at my place when he got off work. He’d give me a big hug, bring me food if I hadn’t eaten and reaffirm how much he loved me and wanted to see me, regardless of whether I had showered or could speak or anything. I would be apprehensive about hanging out but being around someone I KNEW wanted to spend time with me without expectations/with compassion usually helped. Be firm about how you feel and wanting to spend time with her, regardless of what she’s like.

Talking to a counsellor or therapist about what you can do for her/how to cope with it yourself may help, even if it’s just one time. Seeing her therapist with her is also a possibility down the road if she’s open to that.

BipolarReddit,f7fco37,t3_dvwfkv,1573676632.0,"I feel like maybe you indulge in this behaviour because you’re a bit addicted to the rush/validation you get from being right. Maybe you were always the smart kid and you clung to that and exaggerated its importance in your own mind. 

Do you ever try to humble/challenge yourself? Maybe you’re unconsciously aggravating this by seeking out situations/people that make you feel superior. You’re only the most intelligent in your own limited social sphere, so maybe it’s time to challenge that and find some more like-minded people to take you down a peg.

You have a gift. Work on being compassionate towards those that haven’t been blessed with the same level of innate intelligence or thirst for knowledge. Use your intelligence for good and be grateful for it rather than frustrated that others do not have it to the same degree.

When you have an anxious thought pop into your head regarding your oral health try to challenge it instead of ignoring it. Use it as an opportunity to remind yourself to care for your teeth. Also try to practice mindfulness and focus on the feeling of worry in your body and allowing the thoughts to come and go rather than grasping onto them and indulging them. Habits can be very hard to make or break, especially under circumstances like yours, so be self-compassionate when you struggle. Take time to feel proud of yourself every time you do something right rather than feeling ashamed whenever you do something wrong. 

You will only lose your teeth if you keep up these bad habits and don’t get yourself proper dental care, and even if your worst fears were realized there are still options for you (veneers, dentures, etc). Focus on doing what you can now rather than the past or what could happen. 

It may also help to eat more foods that break down/don’t build up plaque, but I can’t remember those off the top of my head. Good luck!"

Focus on challenging your negative attitudes and developing your studying skills - they’re very valuable both in university and after.

After everything that happened to you it’s really understandable that you would expect to continue receiving the same treatment and that can really warp your perception. I know it can be really hard to let go of what happened while you were growing up but it’s really important that you do - you probably need some professional help if it’s affecting your life so much that you can’t even date. 

Having a curvy body can make you look “matronly” I guess (or like a fertile goddess - all about point of view) but that doesn’t mean you look like you’re 40 - it’s just a stupid thing some mean kids said. I think you look absolutely beautiful (holy crap your eyes are (especially) stunning) and I can’t see anything wrong with the way you look based on your pictures.

I was bullied for my looks/personality when I was young too (more so because I was the thin one in a group of overweight friends and a bit of a weirdo (still am but proud of it now)). I didn’t really stop feeling like the weird ugly girl until my early 20s. Getting feedback from people you can trust can really help but you don’t want to be dependent on that. I found looking for beauty rather than flaws in other people as well as myself really helped but it’s a long process for sure and there are many ways of going about it. 

If you are good to people and try your best and they still don’t treat you well then they are not worth your time or energy. Focus on finding truly good people that appreciate you for you - they can be hard to find for everyone and there are a lot of sucky and fake people out there but try not to let that discourage you too much.

That guy is obviously a piece of shit and not capable of appreciating you beyond your body because he sucks and you shouldn’t care about his opinion. You really need to let go of what happened in high school and try to start fresh - moving somewhere else if you still live in your hometown could really help with that if you can. 

I also have other friends that were bullied because they developed larger breasts early on - girls are jealous and look for any reason they can to put you down and then they pressure the dudes to do the same and they use it as an excuse to just use you as a sex object and all this bullshit. You had things they wanted and they put you down to feel better about themselves and justify using you or projecting their own insecurities onto you probably. 

Kids are fucking vicious but you’re definitely at an age where people are much more capable of being mature (although plenty of crappy people stay stuck in high school for the rest of their lives (especially small town folk) but you don’t wanna be friends with those pricks anyway).

changemyview,eyru3xb,t1_eyrs2fy,1567378336.0,"While it is awfully convenient, I think it is a mistake to assume the “nobility” is wholly responsible. Religion/spirituality appeal to the human mind on a very basic level and the common tenets propagate themselves worldwide because they are so useful for establishing productive and peaceful communities. Some evolutionary psychologists consider it an adaptation in itself, created by an amalgamation of other smaller adaptations. The upper class can and certainly has taken advantage of the power of religion, but a force that strong and ubiquitous is certainly not just some manmade conspiracy. 

You assuming there was a specific agent that created religion is caused by the same mechanism that leads people to believe the world must have a creator. It’s generally adaptive to assume that something complex and effective was intended for a specific purpose by an intelligent creator, even if that isn’t always true. 

Read up on the evolutionary origin of religions - it’s very interesting and there’s a lot more to it! Stephen Jay Gould and EO Wilson are both great experts on the subject (they don’t always agree and I tend to prefer the latter but you might not!)."

I know a lot of awesome people that didn’t really blossom socially until after high school.

As you get older, people will mature and be kinder to you and you will learn to not give a shit about the few people that are still mean to you. Your friends could just have a really lame reason for treating you poorly, such as their own jealousy and insecurity. Teenagers can be ruthless for attacking anyone that’s different to make themselves feel better. It’s not about you, it’s about their petty egos. 

Honestly, I probably was a bit annoying but that doesn’t mean I deserved that kind of treatment. I had undiagnosed ADHD so I was a bit hyperactive. It is possible you’re a bit oblivious to the effects of your actions as well, but don’t be hard on yourself for that. You’re young, you’ll learn! You might do things to upset other people without knowing it, but if that’s the case the way they handle it is extremely immature. If they care about you and your friendship they will let you know when and why you upset them. Working on your self-awareness and empathy is always helpful, so try to do that regardless. 

You will find friends that appreciate all your little quirks and your efforts to be a good friend. The people you’re talking to now aren’t your real friends. They’re people you associate with out of convenience because of school. I know it might not be much of a consolation now but it will get better in the future.

If that doesn’t help, try to keep your mind as occupied as possible - find an audiobook or podcast about something that really interests you and play that while you go about your day whenever possible.

socialskills,ey3z7pw,t3_cvfyiq,1566777621.0,"“The customer is always right” mentality is total bullshit and so many service industry workers like yourself have suffered because of it. Trust me, there are millions of people out there that understand and sympathize with your situation, myself included (former fast food worker). Usually people get to blow off steam and get support from their co-workers, and I’m sorry you’re not in a position to do that at the moment, but venting online can help too!

Eventually you’ll learn to not give a shit and it will get better. Fuck your boss, fuck those rude customers. Their rudeness has nothing to do with you - they’re having a bad day or a bad life and they suck hard at coping with it. And your employer has a fat wad of cash weighing on his shrivelled balls, which is why he sides with the paying customers instead of doing the right thing. People are often too wrapped up in their own lives to give a shit about how they affect other people. Sensitive people like you that care are rarer than they should be but trust me, it’s appreciated. The negative ones are much more memorable but I bet a lot more customers than you would think appreciated your efforts to be friendly.

When dealing with stressful social situations, sometimes I think of it like I’m in a sitcom. Plenty of sitcoms are filled with painful, awkward moments  with assholes. Detach yourself from the situation and try to see it in the third person - isn’t it ridiculous how angry people get over stupid crap?? Try to have a(n internal) laugh about how silly they are. Turn it into a funny story. Humour is a great coping mechanism.

You can’t change people, only your attitude towards them. There will always be rude customers and letting them affect you is letting them win. It only hurts you, not them. Just keep doing your best to be a good person and ignore the assholes. If you can find a way to have compassion for them and be kind anyway you might be surprised by how many of them can soften up and feel ashamed of themselves.

If possible, seriously consider looking for a new job. Even if you still have to deal with crappy customers, it’s so much better to have a boss and/or coworkers that are on your side. Sometimes the area or line of work you’re in just attract more cranky assholes. Quitting your job isn’t always a possibility of course, so maybe look into something like loving-kindness meditations to help with the stress.

Read up on the symptoms, keep track of your mood/activity levels and discuss it with a psychiatrist if possible. This is something that could get worse if it goes untreated so getting a professional opinion early on is important.

In the meantime, make sure you’re doing everything you can to balance self-care with taking care of the baby. Keeping busy is good but don’t push yourself too hard.

You were really young and inexperienced when you found your wife, of course you’re going to wonder what other partners are like if you didn’t get to experiment, regardless of your sexuality. It’s not silly at all. 

I think maybe you’re fixating on the idea of gender too much. That feeling in your heart isn’t going to be drastically different just because someone has different genitals and it’s not going to compare to what you feel for your wife if you have a solid marriage. The recent realization with your friend has stirred you up and you need some time to get some perspective and determine how valuable experimenting really is to you. Remember that it’s normal to get crushes in a long term relationship and it may not be that significant. 

Did you discuss your curiosities with your wife or did you just ask about an open relationship in general? She may be willing to help you explore your sexuality if she knows how you’re feeling. I generally tend to be a jealous person but I wasn’t threatened by the idea of my ex being with other guys when he revealed his bisexual feelings to me, although he didn’t end up choosing to explore that."

Very few people expect it to be a panacea anyway and the more ways you have to cope the better. 

The author doesn’t seem to necessarily have a full understanding of mindfulness and how it’s supposed to be used for bipolar disorder. Even so, it’s just one type of meditation.

Understand that if you’re taking his mood swings personally you may be very stressful to be around when he does have mood swings. I doubt he disappears just to punish you - he’s probably too overwhelmed with his own emotions to consider yours or when he does it just makes him feel worse. I know I sometimes have an extremely difficult time just formulating words when I’m overwhelmed with emotion and I dread socializing when I’m depressed, especially when I’m ashamed of myself for my bipolar behaviour. 

Anyway, I don’t know what’s actually going through his head, this is just based on my own experience. If you can’t help taking it personally I think the friendship will be too stressful for both of you until or if he gets a better handle on his emotions (don’t hold your breath). You do not have to help or put up with that kind of behaviour and it’s okay to think it’s not acceptable, but try to have some sympathy for him and consider alternate explanations for his behaviour before labelling it as abuse or just looking at how it affects you.

No, of course not, because sociocultural factors play a huge role and you can’t brand every individual based upon an average. The problem is clearly the type of people that are attracted to owning a dog with a large muscular build - some people want an intimidating and powerful animal to use for their own purposes.

We should ban certain people from owning dogs. The breeding of pit bulls for their strength may be problematic but I think properly trained dogs would cut down on dog attacks a lot more than being selective about which breeds are allowed. The same people that raise violent pit bulls will move on to raise violent Rottweilers or some other breed if they’re banned. Every dog is perfectly capable of being a good dog, regardless of breed, just as every human is capable of being a good person, regardless of race or socioeconomic status."

Don’t listen to her OP. She is not a better person than you just because she’s more social. It is most definitely a skill that can be learned and some people learn later than others for reasons that are beyond their control. You do not sound socially inept to me, just a bit unlucky so far and self-conscious due to your mother’s criticism.

You may have felt like a burden hanging with those other groups but it can take time for hanging out to feel natural, especially if you’re self-conscious and they’re on the awkward side. I didn’t find a real friend group until after high school and it took me over a year to really feel like I belonged because I was so insecure. A lot of my friends were late bloomers as well. One of them was quite unpopular and branded as weird and annoying in high school but she’s in grad school now and has more awesome friends than she can handle.

Plenty of people have a much better time socially in college than they do in high school. You’ll be starting fresh and many of your peers will be as well. It’s one of the best opportunities you’ll get to find a new friend group - you’ll have plenty of opportunities to meet likeminded people, and a great many of them are also insecure about their social skills. Try to bond over/laugh at the awkwardness instead of seeing it as a flaw. 

Make sure you get a head start on socializing so it’s not so intimidating when classes start - look into any freshman events or groups that are hosted by your college.

Depression is a likely culprit but those factors often aggravate the situation. 

Be firm and assertive with your psychiatrist and bring it up again - if he dismisses you rather than exploring the options he probably isn’t as great as you think.

I eventually dropped out to figure things out - talked to therapists, career counsellors, did research, got to know myself, etc. Eventually I figured out something that fits both my wants and needs and I’m more confident in my decision every day (haven’t flip flopped in a loooong time) and I’m starting over at a new university this fall with all the credits I could transfer. 

Going to community college really isn’t the end of the world though and it’s not something you should look down on imo. I come from a highly educated family so I was biased against it for a long time but I’ve seriously considered going there after adjusting my expectations and learning more about it. There can be a lot of benefits (like cheaper tuition, smaller classes) and some have partnerships with universities that allow you to turn a two year diploma into a bachelors degree. Generally seems more structured and hands on with more real world opportunities compared to universities but I’m not sure what things are like where you live.

Don’t let pride and expectations get in the way of your happiness. You might be better off taking a step back from your education and sorting out your mental health and goals before returning - it’s better to wait and have a positive experience that you’re prepared for + know you want than to rush it and half ass it."
bipolar,eofk06a,t3_brm8ha,1558536429.0,"I had an ex that didn’t believe my diagnosis (or the existence of many psychiatric illnesses lol) and it was rough. It took a while to drill it into his head but he eventually accepted it, especially after witnessing the ups and downs firsthand.

I really emphasized to him how much my diagnosis means to me and how much it hurt me when he questioned it. I did my best to explain the disorder to him and all the reasons why I was confident in my diagnosis. I have done a loooot of self-reflection/monitoring + research and I know myself better than anyone. I told him all about how physical/genetic the disorder is, how the diagnostic process worked - anything I could think of that would convince him it wasn’t just the regular ups and downs of life. 

It can be hard being friends with neurotypical people when you need help the most - they usually just don’t get it. It may help to try to explain the differences between mild/moderate/severe depression and myths surrounding them. Sounds like they don’t understand the severity because they’ve never experienced it themselves. Many people have experience with mild/moderate depression so they assume they know what’s up but they don’t understand severe depression and how the treatment differs. 

Do your best to explain how their denial makes you feel and how important their acceptance of your diagnosis is to you. Ask them to hear you out and give you the benefit of the doubt as their friend because it means a lot to you. Tell them exactly what it’s like and how bad it gets if you can. If they can’t do all that for you then they might just be crappy friends that you shouldn’t rely on anyway. They are much less capable of passing judgment on your mental health than yourself and your psychiatrists and it’s just exhausting to be around people like that anyway. 

You might be better off expanding your social group to include some more understanding individuals - maybe try group therapy or make some friends online? Even just having one friend that gets it can make a world of difference."
mentalhealth,eoe4ths,t3_brgw8f,1558488155.0,Have you heard of depersonalization disorder? Try googling that. I wish I could help more but I don’t know much about it - good luck OP!!
mentalhealth,eoe43ht,t3_brgwe8,1558487692.0,"Check out some good self-help books and do some research on neurology/psychology. Psychoeducation and understanding how your brain works can make a big difference. Shop around for something that appeals to you personally. 

I’m not a religious person but spirituality can definitely help as well - Buddhism helped me a lot. I would highly recommend looking into loving-kindness/self-compassion, especially Pema Chodron’s writings on the subject.

Your mental health isn’t ruining anything - it sounds like it’s been neglected for a long time (we’ve all been there!) and now it’s time to take care of yourself. You’re going to be a stronger, more complete and confident person when you return to uni and you’ll have a much better time. It just took you a bit longer to get there than other people and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. 

Good luck OP :)"
Cooking,eoe1bci,t3_brgxt7,1558485880.0,"I pretty much just never pay attention to cooking times in recipes anyway - varies too much. You’re going to miss out on a lot of good recipes if you expect to find accuracy there. Just familiarize yourself with how long different ingredients take to cook, stagger their addition accordingly + test their doneness every once in a while. It can be overwhelming at first but it gets easy with experience."
gainit,eodz79e,t3_brh3fz,1558484462.0,"Bad appetite, a defeated attitude and no motivation? Could be depression or some other issue. Get a full mental/physical check up to be sure if you haven’t already and take care of that first. My appetite gets pretty bad when my stomach is acidic (from stress, smoking, genetics, etc) so sometimes an antacid helps for me. Saw a big difference when I doubled my dose of ranitidine.

If you start working out your appetite may improve in response anyway. Motivation isn’t something you’re gonna magically find and I think that misconceptions about motivation (esp among depressed individuals) often make the problem much worse. I would highly recommend you check out Dr. Kelly McGonigal’s work - she does a course on the science of willpower at Stanford University and has an awesome book called “The Willpower Instinct” that is incredibly helpful for establishing/breaking habits with tons of science to back it up. Totally changed my perspective.

It’s not your genetics or any inherent flaws you may have - it’s the attitude that those things are actually enough to hold you back. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy."
bipolar2,eo8rvha,t1_eo6e51j,1558373456.0,"Definitely, but it can take time to figure out what distinguishes them, especially if you’re newly diagnosed or haven’t been euthymic in a long time. Generally during a happy hypomania I find my excitement/happiness is excessive to the situation, I feel less in control/more impulsive, and it’s punctuated with a relapse into depression. What really tips me off is this sort of buzzing feeling I get in my body, like I drank a ton of coffee and I have all this energy that needs to be expended, which makes me extra fidgety, super talkative/social, motivated, etc. I also usually don’t stay fixated on my mood triggers and my mood carries over to the other parts of my life, which to me indicates it’s not just a normal response. There’s a definite shift in the way my brain is operating. 

Mood episodes may often appear to be in response to something, and may appear especially normal/appropriate with hypomania, but the response itself is inherently abnormal and doesn’t really match up with the situation when you look closer, although some people chalk it up to an over the top personality. I had to really get to know myself/my mood patterns and do my research before I could confidently tell the difference."
