And yet other times, I'm saying, now why would they include that image on that card?  Hmm, I bet there's a good reason... and it gets me to thinking more deeply about the card than I might have before.  Still other cards, I simply say to myself, wow, that's beautiful.

Reminds me of when I first started playing the Sims.  I'm talking Sims 1, a very long time ago... I made a Sim Me and a Sim My Husband.  They had a kid.  Back then, that's it, this kid magically appeared, I don't even remember if they had actual babies back then....but this offspring was a totally different race than my husband and I, which shouldn't have bothered me, but dang it, I wanted a child that looked like us.   


And when the ""name your child"" thingy popped up, I was still upset and couldn't think of a name, so I hesitated....and the darn thing TIMED OUT....leaving me with a kid named...""Sim Child.""  I hated that child.  So I locked it in a room and starved it, which was the most terrible, awful, traumatizing thing to witness....and it took a REALLY long time.    


I never made a Sim Me and/or Sim My Husband ever again....and I always planned ahead for the names of any children that might be born so I wouldn't end up with another ""Sim Child.""  I also figured out much better ways to kill Sims...but that's another story.... :D"

For example, if a young person got the Death card, might they be terrified someone they love was going to die? Or worse, they might feel they are being called to end their own life?  I know, being young doesn't necessarily mean that you think that way... but as a Mom and a teacher, that's where my concern lies.
