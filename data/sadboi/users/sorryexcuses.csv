BPD,fqzv6yu,t3_glu6fl,1589776189.0,"Hello. Ummm. Most definitely, not alone mate. *shows you scars and bruising still healing* 

I know it sounds like a shitty line, but you have inside you all that you will ever need to survive and thrive in spite of this thing. I'm not doing as well as I could be. But it's still better now in my 30s than it was when I was younger. The attacks are less frequent. And much less severe. The actual amount of time I spend suffering in my life is way way way less then ever before. It does get better with therapy and DBT tools and of course practice. 

But here is the surprising thing I have learned. . . NONE of the changes for the better in my life have EVER come from someone else. It's not your boyfriends or friends or families job to pick you up, tell you it will all be ok, and then make it so. Your happiness, your ability to be ok, is your responsibility and yours alone.

If you want a life worth living, it's up to you. And the strength, resilience, and guts needed to get there, are all already part of you. Right now. It would be much easier if someone could be there for you. To pick you up in this moment. But as you see, it's just not always an option. And so in these dark moments of despair. . . Find the tiny fire within yourself and fan those flames with a vengeance. Be honest, your not only worth it, but your so much stronger than you know friend. 

May you find within yourself, the inner strength you seek from others. Good luck."

I am in no way trying to give advice lol. As you can see from my post, I really struggle. But it did get easier with time to accept things for what they are. Thanks for your reply mate.

aww,fqqfsxk,t3_gkbumn,1589564773.0,"Guys it's a beagle. If you want cooperation, you will HAVE to engage the nose, and possibly the tummy as well.

Here is what I mean. Get some cheese/liver/chicken, whatever is your pups to die for treat that is also smelly. It's got to be something special that they dont normally/ever get. People food works best, and the stinkier the better. My old doberman would do my taxes for a banana. But all my other dogs were cheese hounds. Like the spray ""cheese"" in a can. (Just small quantities, and only ever as that extra special treat for giving meds or what have you).  Smoosh this treat onto a spoon, or the inside of a kong, or bone. Just so they cant get it all at once, and it will take several licks to get it all. Wait until just before regular meal time, so between their tummy and their nose, they will be too busy trying to get the treats to really actually care what your doing.
You will have to tease them a little. Pretend your eating it if you have to, waft the smell at the pup, I mean really get them drooling for it. 
Then with the dropper carefully measured and concealed in one hand as best as you can, start rubbing your dogs eyes while allowing TINY insignificant licks of their special smelly treat with the other hand. Then tuck the kong/bone/wooden spoon under one armpit or elbow just to free up your other hand. (By now your rubbing of the eyes and top of head has soothed the pup and those TINY licks probably have them pushing their head into you/your lap. Good.) Now use your free hand to open the eye, while your dog is just trying to get that treat, and with the hand that's been rubbing the eyes and hiding the  meds, drop your drops in the eye, and give the rest of the treat with lots of praise. 

Tips; 1.wear a shirt you dont mind getting messy if/when you get some on you. 
2. Find the treat dispensing thing that works best for you (first time using a Kong or hollowed out bone with cheese or peanut butter smeared on the inside works well, but so did my long handled wooden mixing spoon). 
3. Measure the meds out to the correct dose before you start. 
4. Dont give in and let your pup have this special treat at any other time. This is important or it stops working. 
5. It may take two or three tries until you get it to work just right. But once it does, you may find your pup looking forward to getting his medicine. A big relief. 
And last but not least 6. Work with the breed/personality of your pup. Beagles are scent hounds, and voracious eaters. It's both y we love them and y it works best to engage their noses/tummies. 

Good luck mate!!!!"

Chihuahua,fpw707g,t3_gfvr5t,1588958348.0,"Yes. It was a food allergy. Also goes hand in hand with frequent ear infections. Took three different veterinarians before one told me what was ACTUALLY CAUSING the itchy feet. . . I would never have guessed it was the food. But I switched from purina to nutro small breed. . . And it took about 4 weeks. . . But first the chewing slowed, then stopped all together, his ears cleared up within about 2 weeks, and the hair on his toes returned after the inflammation (from both the allergy and the fact that he would lick them nonstop) went away. I think it was a total of about 6 weeks before all the symptoms went away. We never looked back at cheap dog foods or even treats. 

Been 3 years now and no more chewing, no more licking, no more ear infections. No more relentless vet visits to treat those ear infections. Not even a hot spot here or there. . . I would not have believed it if it didnt happen to my own dog. Good news is, it's really not that expensive to get the good dog food for small dogs. And if it works you will know what it was. But, if it doesn't. . . Or if your pup has open or bleeding sores, just take him to the vet. 

They will prolly want to charge an arm and a leg to take a scraping of the skin to rule out mange or mites or whatever else they can think of to check for. Ultimately, however, make them tell you what is the cause. And if they try to charge an arm and a leg to treat the immune response with prednisone or whatever or look for expensive blood draws or genetic testing. . . Tell them not until you at least try the dog food thing. If it works, it will save you and your pet alot of money, misery, and no testing needed lol. I think I spent arround $2,500 at the first two vets in pills, drops, and tests. What a waste just to find out. . . It was just the shitty dog food fillers. 

Anyways, good luck to you and your pup. I hope you get to the bottom of it."
BPD,fouwa2m,t3_g9oavk,1588091448.0,"It gets better. DBT works if you work it... just like anything worth doing.
I have struggled with being violent since I was a teenager. I have broken people, places, things, and several relationships. I have been abusive physically and emotionally. I have attempted suicide, been hospitalized, went to so so SO much therapy, and taken (as prescribed and illicitly) just about every drug there is. . . I have the capacity to be, a total piece of shit. So destructive, so hateful, angry, bitter, and impulsive. 
I am currently working through the DBT workbook, again. Just at home by myself when noone else is arround. I did the whole DBT program with individual and group therapy last year. (As in the program actually takes a year of twice a week attendance). But it helped. ALOT. Firstly because I saw all these other people at various stages of recovery, and I was forced to see myself in them. We watched a youtube video of a BPD meltdown and it hit me hard to watch it when I was in a mindful state. DBT gave me tools, I have words to use now when I feel it getting out of control. I have a strategy. That's really powerful in getting back your sense of self, especially after you let yourself down. 
It's ok to grieve over the loss of a relationship. Something was there and now it's gone. But it gets better. And DBT was the only thing that helped me make most of my days worth living. 
I still have a lot more to learn and totally have breakdown days. But since therapy is out now anyways, just doing the worksheets and hand outs helps me reinforce like the good mental hygiene habits and identify the ones that still need work. Im worth it tho.
And so are you. You deserve love, acceptance, support, and even healthy relationships. Perhaps if you take the empty space left by your ex and fill it with healthy coping mechanisms, it will create the space you need for your next relationship to flourish. 

Good luck mate. Your not alone."

And break into a million tiny pieces when it's over. I will literally shatter and watch all the tiny bits go bouncing about never to be found again. 

I've left pieces of me in all my past relationships. And each time to puzzle gets harder to put back together. More holes and jagged edges then I can fill with all the tears I've shed. 

And yet, even the most jagged and broken stones will be worn perfectly smooth by the sands of time. 

But that means you will have to expose yourself the elements. Stand there naked and know, that at your very core is the truly indestructible however tiny bit that is you.

I am not actually smart enough to navigate all that. That's why I called them ahead of time. Told the name of the dental surgeon, his regular dentist information. All the stuff I could think of.

BPD,fkeunua,t3_fi2507,1584121044.0,"I wish my now husband would have had the strength to be that honest with me while we were still dating. BPD is a selfish disease that takes and is never satiated. I was in therapy for a long time. And every time I stop going, i revert to some old behaviors and faulty thinking. It starts slow, so slow I dont always notice until my husband starts saying something about it. 
It takes an immense amount of personal strength and emotional resilience to be with me. Maintaining healthy boundaries, and recognizing not only his own feelings and experiences, but also sort of keep an eye on me and my feelings and thoughts. . .its twice the work. And sometimes entirely thankless because the last thing I want to hear is that I'm not doing as good as I was and that it's time to go back. Its draining and he is not a therapist nor a trained professional. He is just a man, who has good and bad days too.  
I dont think he ever really fully understood what he was signing up for. It's like in his head, if I loved him and respected him enough I would get better. 
But the thing is, no matter how amazing and supportive he is, this level of damage did not get here overnight. And no matter how much I love him, it wont leave overnight. In all likelihood, this will be a life long struggle.
I think if we had more honest conversations about BPD before we got married, taken more time to really explore what that would look like and set some healthy boundaries from the get go. . . We both would have saved so much heartache and pain for the other person. There was so much blame, and so very much guilt, and downrigh anger that we had to work through ONTOP of what we already brought into the relationship. (He wasnt perfect either). 

Honesty takes self awareness and strength. And the very very very best thing you can do for the people in your life who care for you, regardless of title, is to listen. Hear her when she says she needs something, and respect the hell out of her for having the clarity to see it, and the balls to tell you the truth. Work on your journey and get the help you need. Because nothing is sexier that a man willing to work on his own shit for your sake. And nothing will inspire more loyalty and steadfastness.

You may yet come to realize, that working on that stuff and getting healthy now, will make your relationship with her like bombproof. Love only grows when protected and respected. 

Good luck to you both. Dont let BPD take anything more from you. Not. One. More. Thing. 🤗🤗"

Think of it this way, if you wouldn't say it out loud to someone you love on their shitty day. Then do not say those things to yourself. For example, if your friend failed at something the first time they tried something. You would NOT say to them, ""you boring piece of shit. Your such a piece of trash. You bring nothing to this!"" So why do you talk that way to yourself then? 

Maybe, the best place to start being a good friend to others. . . Is to be a good friend to yourself. You are a human being both capable of, and worthy of; love, kindness, support, honesty, and yes. . .even friendship.

One thing that actually helped me, was wearing my fitbit regularly. I use the period tracker on there to get pop ups that says 4 days until your period, 3 days, 2 etc. It reminds me to check my emotional state and really consider what I say before I say it. 

I give myself a little leeway to just pause major decisions/reactions, and wait it out until I'm focused and level again."

If your just a shitty person, then you dont have to work as hard at changing. What's the point right? 

WRONG. Admitting your issues takes time and dedication to the process. The process of acknowledging your own unhealthy thought patterns. The process of admitting that perhaps you are more than just your issues. You are a person with many facets and with time and nurturing the good stuff inside you will begin to be uncovered. With therapy and living an examined life, you can learn to love who you are. All of you. And not just be overtaken by the shitty, judgemental inner voice you learned and have internalized.

There is another life waiting for you. Be brave. Face the shitty ineffective patterns you have developed. And cast them off like the garbage they are.

Not alot of memories from back there besides being hungry, and lonely. Alot. My sister was older so when she could she would go to friends or neighbors. Then it was just me. When we moved to the US, I couldn't speak English so school was a lonely place. I was just a weird kid who didnt really make friends. My mom and biological father split pretty quick after the move. Never saw my dad again which was fine because they were violent with each other and with me and my sister. My mom got with other men, had another baby when I was 10. And as soon as my older sister could, she left home for good. My mom would beat me, threaten me, tell me I was never wanted, and threaten to send me back to Europe all the time. My mom was nicer to my little sister, because as long as her dad was still in the picture he wouldn't let her hurt my little sister. But I was always fair game. By 16 i was a chronic runaway. Got cought by the police, labeled as truant and a miscreant and sent to an alternative school. Not that I had friends from my old school. Most of the time i was alone. It was always just me. Now I'm an adult with almost zero interaction with anyone from my family. I dont have any extended family that I know of like grandparents or cousins. I think my dad died a couple years ago somewhere in Europe. My mom is busy living her best life with my older sister. I dont talk to either of them. I text once or twice a year with my little sister, but it's been a couple years since I've seen her. Noone ever really wanted me. Noone ever really needed me. They still dont.

I hate to say it but brother. . . She doesn't respect you, and begging for her to wont make it happen.  
Your not abandoning her. And her BPD may be rooted in her relationship with her parents, but they're not the ones making you beg on your knees for forgiveness. . . She is. And if she doesnt value you as a human being, she wont value you no matter what title she allows you to have. Friend, boyfriend, servant, or else. . .

Leave. Leave while you still have the ability. The longer you stay the harder it becomes to see yourself as anything different then what your partner accuses you of being.

BPD,f3tyjwt,t3_di6uzp,1571149113.0,"Ok so. . . After a year of treatment here is what I got that works for me. . . Use only if and how you find helpful. 
Step 1. Get physically cold - like real cold. Freezing water on my face and neck or go outside if it's cold enough. Ice cubes, ice pack, or cold wash rag on the back of my neck. Ice cubes in my hand till they melt if I'm at work and cant do the first two. If that's not possible get a cold can of soda from vending machine and put it on the back of my neck. If people say anything I say I have a migraine and this helps. (Noone really cares if they think it's for a common reason) but the point is to get cold till I feel real pain. 
Step 2. Acknowledge the pain I am physically feeling. That pain is real. If I need that feeling to last until I am back I will get more ice, more water, or simply wait outside until the shivers take over. That feeling is my real body reacting. I am physically here experiencing cold. 
Step 3. Breathe deeply and just notice my physical body. What do my clothes feel like? Like in the greatest amount of detail can I describe everything about . . .what I can smell? What I can taste? What else is there besides the cold? I dont usually go for what I see or hear because those things are too easy and quick. But making myself smell, taste, or touch something draws the process out and slows it down. Say if there is a leaf on the ground, I will pick it up and count each color, each corner, each crinkle, and every tiny little detail. That leaf is real. The skin on my hands is feeling the texture. Breathe deeply till you cant ignore the cold a second more. The cold is real. And your body is reall. Your real. And you matter. 
Step 4. Account for the rest of me and acknowledge what's happening. Am I feeling something unpleasant? Am I tired? Hungry? Am I upset about something? Did something make me mad? Give a name to all the things going on inside me. Doesnt have to be the right one and I reserve the right to change my mind about it later. But for right now. What am I feeling and what is happening to me? Have I physically given my body what it needs to exist? Do I need to drink some water? Am I feeling overwhelmed by something? Now is not the time to try to solve anything. Simply exist for this moment and acknowledge what is real. I am real. I am physically sitting/standing/kneeling/laying here and I feel _______________________. 
Step 5. When I am back, and feel calm and ready, i will go through and physically write down what I did for steps 1-4. Writing down just the facts, what was happening in the moments leading up to it? Did I miss my meds? Did I argue with someone? What really happened to trigger the physical dissociation? What was it that was too much in that moment? How did I cope? What did I notice? Was the cold enough to snap me out? Did I need to go outside? What exactly happened to me physically? This is still not the time to fix anything or make it so that never happens again. This is also not the time or place to judge yourself. Write whatever feels right to you about what happened, but stay away from ""bad, stupid, weird, childish. . .etc"".
Step 6. Make a plan for the next time this happens, or adjust my current plan, based on what worked or helped and what did not. 
Step 7. Forgive myself for whatever it was or it wasnt. I am a real person, with real feelings, and thoughts that deserve to be acknowledged. Even if it's just by me at first. 

I have learned that I disassociate when I feel that I am not being heard or seen by someone. It sets me on a tail spin into the realm of ""i dont matter, noone cares if i live or die, am i even a real person"" etc. I panic inside my head, have a mental or emotional meltdown, and feel myself somehow slipping away because it's all just too much. . . But I have also learned that there is a way back. It's just that its different for everyone. And your way back has to meet whatever needs were ignored on the road leading up to this event. That's a really hard to thing to do. But it's worth it when you come out the other side to find yourself. 

Dont give up. Your struggle is real. You are real. And there really is a way out to a better place."

BPD,ezyutf4,t3_d2z75n,1568275081.0,"Yes. When your sick there is a full scale war going on inside your body. . . Germs of some sort have invaded and are waging full scale offensive on you physically. So while your body is launching it's own immune response, its pulling all the resources it has to defend against the army of microbes using you as a breeding ground. . . And while your immune system is attempting to keep you alive (literally - people die inspite of modern medicine from bacterial and viral infections etc) it drains whatever resources it can to support the mission of keeping you physically alive. Not to mention, people with BPD may not have vast emotional and or mental resources to begin with. . . In short, when anyone is sick, they simply have less energy/abilty to devote to complex tasks like emotional regulation. So for people with BPD, they can be much more susceptible to becoming emotionally disregulated.
Rest, drink fluids, eat, ask for help, see the doctor for physical symptoms, and dont be hard on yourself for feeling like poopoo caca emotionally. It literally happens to some degree or another to all humans.

BPD,eyuq5l1,t1_eyukzj5,1567469119.0,"Yes, I know it's all over the place. It hard for me to sum up where we are after years of crappy treatment. So he was a stay at home dad for 2 years even tho my son has been in daycare since I went back to work after my maternity leave. He works when he wants to. I have stopped battling that long ago. He mostly sells pot on and off. And claims he does maintenance. But it's a total load of crap. He has depression and anxiety. We met when we were both seniors in our bachelor degrees. I have since graduated and got my masters so I could work and make at least a livable wage. However my student loans about as much as my rent so for the next 5 to maybe 7 years I will be pretty broke. It's ok. I dont mind the broke part so much as I grew up poor. Like dirty and poor lol. But in that time he dropped dout of school, only graduated because he stole my work. . . Literally stole my old school papers and handed them in as his own claiming he broke his back until his last three professors just passed him so he could graduate. I'm still pretty upset about all that actually. 

Hes not very supportive. He puts up with alot tho. Hes not a bad guy, as in he doesnt kick puppies and doesnt steel from kids. But he has problems all on his own. It's a toxic stew of learned helplessness and violent outbursts at our place. And there is more to his story then I give credit for. He has been through alot too and has bad days like everyone else. I'm no saint to be with is an understatement. 

I dont want to condemn him as this total asshole because hes a person, doing his best, in a shit situation. Were just no good for each other. 

I inve heard us described as two flowers with no gardner. I need support in ways he cant provide. And he needs. . . I dont even know. . . Not me. 

But I should make a list. Back to basics, take the emotion out and see if I can make heads or tails. 

Thanks for the advice. I think leaving this relationship is the only way for either of us to get any better. But if I cant put it into words, then itll only be harder to see through the emotional fog. Maybe setting the record straight for once will help me see a better way out.

I saw what it was like to live with me, had people to commiserate with that actually understood what it was like, and got a great place to bounce ideas arround and how to need less from him.

I learned coping strategies, and how to appropriately engage my husband on sensitive topics. Or even to ask for what I needed from without imposing my will on him or telling him what to do. That was a big one. I also learned how to apologize without loosing myself. 

My work continues, but if you have a DBT program near you. I highly recomend it. Even if you cant save the marriage, you might be able to salvage the relationship. You are not alone. And I'm rooting for you luv!!!!"
BPD,eyicp8a,t3_cx3aut,1567100579.0,"Same here. I attribute my forgetfulness to my ADHD however. And dissociation to the BPD. Sometimes, I just wait for it to pass. Other times I need to check in with myself to figure out why it's happening now. 

I've learned that often triggers can hide in day to day hustle and bustle. And I may not even be aware that something bad is happening inside my head until physical symptoms appear. 

Self awareness is key to lessening the number of times this happens. . . But it takes constant vigilance. And that's alot of effort. No that's a monumental effort."
BPD,eyibrzk,t3_cx2uve,1567100216.0,"Here here!! Age seems to have nothing to do with any of it. 

Only time I ever thought I was doing better was while I was in treatment. Attended intensive outpatient for a year. Graduated and felt so proud. . . Only to relapse within weeks. 

There is no end, and nothing easier about getting old. Only hope is constant self work, regular check ins with a mental health team, and never letting your guard down. Managing my BPD is a full time job under the most unscrupulous of bosses."
BPD,eyi8l1f,t3_cx00w6,1567098975.0,"Yes, I am an angry piece of shit. So very angry at all the things that happened, that I cant let go of, that I cant fix or make ok. They fester in my soul and spew forth from me like hot lava destroying anything in my path. Just when the ashen dust settles from one eruption another starts brewing. 

It lies in wait, like a terrorist, until maximum damage can be inflicted. Then erupts scalding me in the process, annihilating any and everything. People, pets, where I live, and what I do for a living. The white hot toxic ooze of anger and downright rage burns me over and over again. Yet never kills me.

It's my curse. To survive the damage and destruction. Over and over again. To know I am toxic and dangerous. To see myself act like this hurts to my very core. I am ashamed. Embarrassed, and so weary of the battle. 

I want it to just stop. All of it. Please. I beg the gods to destroy me once and for all. To let me burn down. The world to take me out. For someone to put me out of my misery. 

Whatever mistakes I made in my past have not been forgiven. My wrongs not righted. My sentance has not been fully carried out. So I continue to exist to spite myself. 

Peace eludes me. Hope abandoned me. And the future beckons with a sinister knowing of what is to come. 

I hate that I exist. I know not what my crimes were. But I have come to know all too well the anger and rage that protects me from ever being anything else. In that you are not alone."
BPD,ey2ifpi,t3_cv5bwd,1566740300.0,"Your hair does not define you. Nor does what anyone else thinks. You survived something you didnt think you were going to. That is my favorite feature about you. 😏 

Your so much stronger than you give yourself credit for. Sending you good vibes and good luck on your journey."
BPD,exrpfl0,t3_cu4ozl,1566520800.0,"Hello, 
First things first. I'm sorry your struggling luv. Finding a work/life balance is hard for everyone, and for people like us, it can feel impossible. 
The anxiety, panic, and shame you feel about your symptoms can come on strong and linger for days... itll weigh you down before you ever even make it out the door, if you make it out the door. I know just how awful that can be. When I was younger I really struggled with holding a job down, especially if it wasnt one I was totally into. 

That said, I will offer one piece of advice. Dont tell people at work about your mental health. Unfortunately, bosses are not mental health experts, and often lack the compassion and understanding needed to support you. If your job has an employee assistance program (those are usually confidential), where people with at least some type of training can get you in touch with resources then by all means, use that for whatever help you need or think you can get. . . But divulging emotional and mood instability to bosses, or even coworkers who you think are also friends, often leads to judgement, gossip, and usually from people who just dont know what BPD is, or dont care to know. They can call your judgment into question. They can pass you over for important projects or promotions out of fear or even just uncertainty in how you will react. 

It's totally not fair, but it happens often enough that those of us who wear or heart on our sleeve should proceed with caution. Alot of people out there, will see it as an excuse, or worse. 

Also, it sounds like some of the symptoms you are having are not well managed right now. If you are throwing up all the time, you should talk to a doctor and or therapist to make a plan tailored to you and your life on how to face these issues and find what tools are available to you. Maybe you need medication or a change in meds. Maybe you need to start your mornings with a routine, like a short walk to settle your mind, or some morning yoga to get you into the right head space so you can face your day. Your anxiety sounds rough as all get out right now, so having judgement or reprisals from work may not be something your ready to take on atm. Also talking to a doctor can rule out medical reasons beyond just the bpd. 

I have learned that the most valuable part of surviving the work place is knowing who you can trust with your emotions and mental health. Not everyone will listen and learn. And those people will sometimes unintentionally nd sometimes on purpose make things worse. 

""Some people get their kicks from stomping on a dream"". And if your new back to the work place, you may not even know who those people are yet. 

Anywhoo, please dont take this to mean you shouldn't talk to people about what's going on with you. Absolutely the opposite is true. Just be careful, and choose who you trust with care. You deserve a shot at success in the work place as much as anyone else. Especially as you are just returning to the workplace. Which by the way, IS A HUGE STEP. 🤗🤗🤗🤗 and something to be proud of. Dont let these temporary set backs limit your future possibilities. And don't assume that a boss, supervisor, or coworker will have anything positive to add to your efforts. 

Good luck on your journey luv. It will get easier the longer you go. I've been at my job almost 6 years now. . . That's longer then almost all of my relationships 🤣. (I'm working on that part tho)."
BPD,exft8mz,t1_exfe6di,1566247873.0,"So I went to my gyno and started that I suspect that's what I have. She was pretty adamant that even though there is one approved birth control for PMDD, she said that all act differently for different people and that I would just have to try em all until I find one that worked for me. Shes got a 3 or 4 month wait for an appointment. . . So I just accepted whatever she prescribed at the time, some generic birth control pill, and left. Pretty discouraged with life in every way possible atm. Not sure if fighting to get another doctor to believe me is something I can take on. . . Specially as right now, I guess I need to find a way to leave my family and my kid for their safety. Tbh I dont feel like there is much hope. Perhaps people like me just dont deserve to be in a relationship or to have kids. I feel so rotten. Maybe a hysterectomy would be better then playing arround with a hundred more birth control options. I dont know. I just dont know any more. I did my best and it's not enough."
BPD,exd0oep,t3_cs4xpf,1566164318.0,"Thanks for all who commented. I appreciate your time and suggestions. I have no idea how to leave as the primary and often only income, and sole provider of health insurance for all of us. . . Though no, i do not make enough to pay bills here and go live somewhere else myself. In other words what I make a year is just barely above the poverty line. . . but it sounds like it's what's best. Maybe, in a couple years when I have my shit together. . . If i get my shit together, perhaps then I can try again with my kid. I have no hope for me and my husband as i think we are both lost in my BPD. 

Here is hope that kindness finds it's way back to all the redditors tenfold. And that I find my way out of the lives of those closest to me before I completely destroy them."
BPD,excoy3b,t3_crthps,1566155996.0,"Maybe it's both. Maybe your doctors are proud of you because you sound like you've come a long way. AND your still not to the point in your recovery where you would like to be; suffering less every day. Your journey is still underway, and perhaps what you have now is just a slightly better picture in your mind of what the destination looks like for you."
BPD,excnn1d,t3_cs3cxv,1566155064.0,"Today is a struggle and that's your truth. Mine too 🤗🤗. Own it, and the fact that the voice inside your head saying ""I want to die"", lies to you in your weakest moments. It's a crappy friend who does NOT have your best interest at heart. Dont listen to it."
