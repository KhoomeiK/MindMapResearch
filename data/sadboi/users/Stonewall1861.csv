thedivision,f0swecf,t1_f0qls0r,1568911731.0,"I do see your points and they are valid, however how long has div2 been out- 6 months? As soon as i got it and read about EB i thought that would be a statistical outlier because its so much better than any thing else. So why release it like that? Its obvious what will happen. This is the frustrating bit for all those people that ground hundreds hours out to get it and now six months in it gets a big fat nerf. Does it matter in pve that its very very good? Not at all, its not like npcs have feelings about things being unfair on them. 

Another example in a different way is btsu gloves. I spent hundreds hours piecing together a skill build - back when skills were rubbish, but i wanted an explosives build! Skills got buffed and i spent an age re-tweaking my set. Then randomly got btsu gloves. Sweet! (Hadnt even been that fussed about getting them). And now they make my skill builds so much more effective that its unlikely i will ever run any other variation in terms of gloves. Compare using say terminate (which is actually now really crap because the % dmg increase hasnt scaled with the new dmg mods)- you have to put in effort to get a temporary buff of 25-35%(?) for short amount of time. Btsu gloves u literally just need a status effect to infuse- eg shoot one explosive bullet and you get 100-150% depending on yellows count buff for a whole minute after minimal effort."

Getting one with all the right bits to play with like that is hard enough- so its absolutely gutting if you get one with a yellow (useless for that build) or blue (probably wont fill it anyway as i l get more health from backpack and mask)."
ww1,ezymo4z,t3_d2o70a,1568270853.0,"I find both WWs to be fascinating in different ways and have enjoyed studying them. Personally i have recently also found the american civil war extremely interesting as many of the technologies used in ww1 first came to life in the civil war. In that 4 year period war begun in a a very napoleonic classical way (cavalry, men lining up shooting while standing) and finished somewhat similar to ww1 (trenches, telegraph, examples of early machine-gun and defensive attritional battles).

thedivision,eztrsnd,t1_eztd2cp,1568137193.0,"A lot of people didnt like the new approach of puzzling coloured blocks etc, they wanted the same stat system as before. I actually like the new system and enjoyed learning all its different mechanics eg talent-rolling. I do think it was implemented clumsily tho and the mod system certainly way too convoluted. 

It doesnt take a genius to work out the maths tho that div2 did add a couple extra layers rng- and something they really should have learnt from div1 was a high time to reward ratio results in dissatisfied players so they had to change it. We do currently have a high time to reward ratio because of the frankly ridiculous rng! They could have kept the new system as it has been a slightly refreshing change but reduced a layer or two rng- eg. Enable 2 stats to recalibrated or allow a way to increase chances of getting a specific item. Cant speak for everybody but that is one area i personally am critical of them for not learning from previous mistakes. . . 

Still love the game tho and will carry on playing whatever changes they make. Mostly hoping for harder content like heroic difficulty for the regular factions and a new resistance-style mode"
