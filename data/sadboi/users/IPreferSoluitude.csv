childfree,fgp74bd,t1_fgozzjb,1580998504.0,I love the idea of an 18+ rule!!
seduction,fgp6rcj,t1_fgozfix,1580998258.0,"Ooo I wish that happened! It occasionally does. Especially at work people tend to be way more polite about it. I currently have one man at work that has expressed not being able to work with me due to carnal desire. Whatever that means. His loss. The one positive interaction that always stands out the most was at a casino. I was waiting for my girlfriends to meet me to leave really late one night. I was approached and the guy was so kind when I told him no thank you, that we spent a few more minutes talking before my girls showed up. He clued me in that he was trying to date again after ending a long relationship and that it felt awkward to him. 

There have been men that have offered to buy me a drink and when told I am married they bow out this way. More often than not the comments are actually something along the lines of “but is he as cute as me” or some other overly confident silliness. 

But no not exaggerating. Most interactions are during the time I wait for public transit/walk to my office/or shopping. I started using a grocery delivery service after a man and his wife approached me together by the yogurt. It was the final straw as it was an issue every time I shop. One store employee told me he was nervous when I asked him where to find maple syrup, tripped over the box he was unpacking and then walked away. Was recently approached at Home Depot while buying tile told the man I was married, and he said “hahah well fuck me then right?” and threw his hands in the air. Which is the point when I walk away and the employee witnessing it asked if I was ok.

Forget trying to pump gas by myself if someone is at a pump near by. I’m trapped and it’s always some comment about how slow the pumps are or what the fuck ever that is being used as an opener. Comments about the megabucks sign, whatever they can think of in that moment. Compliments on my car. Conversation about the weather. Etc. My SO has run many interventions for me when people have thought I was alone and he was just an isle over or something. this is not the same as the little old man that is lonely and just looking for general conversation.

Most of the time the openers are “Wow, I love your hair” or eyes, or they ask for directions, or some other random subject matter. Compliments are awesome! What follows is generally the un-fun piece. You can often tell when this is just a conduit to open up conversation. If you try to get away too fast you’re a huge bitch, not fast enough and you were sending signals. Can’t win.

On Wednesday had someone approach me while mid conversation with a coworker I was getting coffee with at lunch time. It’s plain rude. That afternoon was stopped on the street by a woman that told me her friend thinks I’m cute and pointed back to him and asked if I would like to be introduced. Then, the train conductor told me I should come down to his door when exiting (I went to the other door) and his coworker told me “that man has a crush on you”. That’s 3 in one day. I am flying tomorrow so that will be fun. I’ll be honest, I do get a bunch of free stuff because of it so that can sometimes be cool. There is literally dick just lining the streets. It’s super scary when they cat call you in groups and you’re alone. 

Don’t even get me started on social media issues holy F. I’ve seen way too many dicks from people that should never be sending anyone that content unsolicited(ex-teachers, friends husbands, etc). People have used it to stalk me from 4+ hours away and show up at events I’m at despite having had a fake username and photo. 

A recent trip to NYC = comments/cat called every 2 blocks for 60 blocks. It was 30 interactions and I had a girlfriend with me that just goes what the f?! I have been physically chased on more than one occasion (Paris city center and Rural America).

I’m sharing in hopes that people understand what some women are experiencing and how it leads to us being super skeptical and standoffish. What you may think of as a test is just a woman trying to protect herself after a laundry list of unsolicited interactions that went poorly. It is not because of the nice guys that are simply trying to create a connection but the collective bad experiences make it very hard for good men to break down those layers of doubt. Let’s be honest, when it is so common that it is a daily event you become pretty annoyed when people try and obtain your attention and you just want to go about your business.

I’ve been told so many different things I should alter about myself so this won’t happen. “You should die your hair or shave your head.”, “You should only wear big baggy clothes.. that will keep them away.” “You should stop wearing make up”. I tried only wearing black for awhile. It just made guys that like that look come out of the woodwork. Plus, I can’t consistently restrict all aspects of myself so I can be left alone but still function in the world. That’s nutso.

From my perspective (obviously just one persons experiences here so take it only as a collective reflection on those experiences) the best thing a man can do is have organic conversation plus interests and excitement about the things in his life without agonizingly pining over his love life. Being able to learn something new from a guy, that is so hot. Passion and respect are more attractive than anything else.

If anyone else has questions from this perspective I would be mega happy to answer them and help. Not looking for discontent or argument just to share experience based knowledge. I want everyone to find what they are looking for!"

Women being nice in no way means she wants to fuck.

I get approached by men ~5-10x a week, despite working from home 4 days a week. I do not social media outside of Reddit due to aggressive male behavior and stalking.

I have had MANY men confuse basic conversation as flirting, and they get it in their heads that there is somehow hope in the future of sexual interaction or dating despite the fact that I talk about my significant other constantly. I have been in no way interested and it has led to embarrassment/uncomfortable situations ON THE REGULAR throughout my life.

The moral is, just don’t be a predator. Use your brain and make logical decisions. Don’t rely on “hints” that don’t exist."

I am 31 with 3 degrees now but I struggled in high school. I became anti social and my grades were horrendous. In reflection recently my mom asked why I thought that was. My response: being locked in a building 8 hours a day with horny teenage boys is literally hell on earth if you don’t crave sexual attention. It was the worst 4 years of my life hands down. I was sexually harassed regularly and teachers responses would be about my clothing or what I was doing to “ask for it” but I never wore revealing clothing and most girls wore wayyy more revealing clothing than I did and I kept to myself. I didn’t understand it then, but I didn’t ask for it in anyway and I was being dismissed and blamed. I was a relatively poor farm kid. My outfit was def not a priority and I was too young to understand what was happening. I was pretty and I paid for it.

Teenage boys are the worst. Entitled moms of teenage boys can be monsters."

intj,fgh2vgo,t3_eydy16,1580775390.0,"I think I may be able to relate. I had about two straight years of feeling utterly lost due to existential crisis. I have always generally been in awe at how effectively life fights entropy, but for awhile there I regularly considered my own purpose and position and was genuinely disappointed and horrified. I couldn’t fathom a reasonable answer to many of life’s unanswered questions or any reason to believe that humans were anything more than a virus on the planet.

I spent a lot of time learning and exploring and devouring education from many perspectives and information led me to find that awe again. Is that kind of what you mean? If it is, the conclusion that gave me peace was that even though I didn’t ask to be here, or agree with the cog, or feel comfortable all the time, I may as well enjoy reaping the benefits of all the successes of past life while I am here. Each day I consider how perfect the cell-to-cell symbiosis has to be for us to exist, for other life to exist, for buildings to stand, for ships to sail, and clouds to generate. It is inspired. This also helped me realize I hope that there may be an afterlife, but I don’t expect it. My time here on this earth is enough of a gift. I don’t need something else after. That is a peaceful feeling for me after the time spent remunerating day in and day out about the purpose of life. 

Because of that I now live my best life. I feel like I appreciate more. I don’t settle or put up with toxic people. I do work I am passionate about and always make time for my hobbies. I do this out of respect for the balance that allows me the time here to experience what the world has to offer."

Also, wish my male coworkers understood how painful it is for some women to experience monthly cycles and that it makes it very hard to get through a day when they are in that much pain. It can be painful to move from sitting to standing, or vice versa. Not everyone is able to just take medicine to stop the pain, so don’t assume.l and just be kind/patient.

VirginRiverNetflix,ffycd57,t1_ffy6xkc,1580343062.0,Same! She’s so needy. It’s gross.
RedheadedGoddesses,ffuy5j6,t3_evcalp,1580251578.0,I’d say you are a Goddess.
ptsd,fftc4ht,t3_eupi6t,1580216038.0,Thank you. My sentiments exactly.
truechildfree,fftbty7,t3_ev21g4,1580215761.0,"Hi! Thank you for sharing! I felt just like this my whole life as well! I am also 31F. My husband used to always say things like your fiancé. As time passed we have both very much embraced being childfree, and after watching pretty much everyone we know start families we feel more confident than ever in our decision. Best wishes to you both!"
childfree,ffiglme,t1_ffif9n3,1579973382.0,Lol not a very deep thinker are you? The issue surrounds the restriction of access. It is a simple procedure and could be very low cost if there was not so much red tape stopping the access for women from pro-life and religious groups or political parties with totalitarian agendas. That’s a human rights issue. Your aged rhetoric is cute though.
childfree,ffiarw7,t3_etpnh5,1579969416.0,"I usually respond to that kind of stuff with single word responses, or no response. Maybe just like a thumbs up emoji, or something basic like that. Not continuing to engage those interactions will lead her to send less of them because she doesn’t get a reaction of any kind. It’s just a dead stop. My friend taught me this tactic about 5 years ago and it works really well IMO."
childfree,ffiaa9l,t3_etr52n,1579969082.0,"I have struggled to maintain friendships with those that have kids now. I can’t ever seem to give them enough of my time or energy to accommodate them because they have kids and we don’t. I got so overwhelmed by all the expectations placed on us that I just stopped trying altogether, and made a bunch of CF friends."
childfree,ffi9xpp,t3_etr4hn,1579968836.0,I have 3 degrees and none of them were ever met with the enthusiasm my mom has for ever kid my brother creates (now up to 6 but only takes care of 3 of them). Makes zero sense to my husband and I.
childfree,ffi8chh,t1_ffi6jgb,1579967714.0,"Oh yes heard all of those before, ugh. Is there a lot of upheaval where you are surrounding these rights? I thought Germany had a lot of options. Best wishes to you in your search!"
childfree,ffi82hz,t1_ffi6z7r,1579967518.0,"I concur, barbaric is the right word here IMO"
childfree,ffi7ylg,t1_ffi7t33,1579967441.0,That’s a great question. If that was a legal option I would 100% travel for that.
childfree,ffi4tqe,t1_ffi4jm6,1579965100.0,That makes perfect sense. I know I shouldn’t dwell and let it fester but man oh man.
childfree,ffi4pwe,t1_ffi4l6y,1579965015.0,"Not shocked at all, just heartbroken."
AnimalsBeingDerps,ffhjleh,t3_etiba2,1579938221.0,This little guy!!!!!! I’m gushing!
AnimalsBeingDerps,ffgitf2,t3_esn50r,1579907216.0,This guys reaction Hahahaha!
AnimalsBeingDerps,ffgifkj,t3_ethg7u,1579906958.0,Oh this nugget looks like they know how to snuggle!!
AnimalsBeingDerps,ffgi8iv,t3_ethej1,1579906829.0,Hahahaha mega derp moment she’s awesome
childfree,ffg9mli,t1_fffpsd7,1579901437.0,Omg seating chart questions and other expectations like thank you cards are the reason I wanted to elope. It was important to my husband to have a big wedding so we did but damn people were annoying. I didn’t make a seating chart and sent out generic thank you cards. Shit man I was a full time grad student working full time just wanting to be married to my partner and best friend. Was not at all interested in the other shit.
childfree,ffg90or,t3_etbrar,1579901061.0,"Wow sounds like she needs another hobby. I don’t go to showers, ever. Also didn’t have one for my wedding. You’re right, they are greedy and tacky. They really only make sense for poor people but at that points it’s like, why are you having a baby if you can’t afford crib sheets?"
childfree,ffexjp1,t3_et6za9,1579869493.0,"Yeah I have an idiot brother like this too. He has 6 kids and he’s a shit dad, but has made comments like this to me in the past. It got to the point where I was pointing out his idiocy so often that I had to just stop being around him altogether."
childfree,ffex9oj,t1_ffefm0i,1579869210.0,"I don’t like this response because it’s like then why are babies programmed to have a queued up cry that is so obnoxious? If all us women were “programmed” as such then the cry of a child didn’t need to be so annoying. However, it is so annoying and persistent so that parents won’t ignore it. The annoyance is the motivation to handle whatever the childs issue is in that moment. It’s like they can’t see that side of it."
childfree,ffewhjp,t3_et5k8o,1579868403.0,I’ve been told this many times while finishing up and MBA by men. When people say this to me I ask them if they are depressed because they see no value in anything life has to offer without children... and go on to say that there are many things out there that are stimulating and fun and if they would like help exploring all this world has to offer I would be happy to offer suggestions. In my experience it makes them feel and look ignorant and the subject pretty quickly changes after that.
