But at the same time, I truly mean NO disrespect for OP with the girlfriend. I don’t think “one size fits all” - People can feel alone or lonely in different circumstances & maybe the gf is a jerk & makes him feel even more alone.

loner,fn7431n,t3_fzpi9j,1586712899.0,"Same here. It’s such a relief to not be the odd one out for being alone all the time. It makes me feel more “normal” in a way now that I’m not the only one.

When I’m actually with other people they think I’m an extrovert, but really I like being by myself in almost every circumstance I can think of. I like to do things that require solitude like making things & learning & thinking. I have a dog and cable & stuff to do. I hardly ever feel lonely ever! 

But I am also extremely worried about myself bc I feel like it’s not normal. 

I never feel like going out or even picking up the phone–ever. I have to force myself bc it just feels like too much effort, or like a “distraction” from whatever else I was doing that I am usually much more absorbed in.

It has nothing to do with how much I like the person or not, I don’t think I’m better than anyone at all - if anything Its often the opposite! 

But nevertheless people start getting used to it & eventually give up which is totally understandable. 

But now I’m getting scared of waking up someday & finding myself stuck all alone against my will bc I lost all connections & have no choice but to be alone when I don’t want to be anymore."

I’m looking to get the fuck outta here"
careeradvice,fn510ij,t3_fzecto,1586653392.0,"You’d be surprised how hard it is to get fired. Employers have absolutely zero loyalty to their employees. Remember that they would dump you and anyone else that works for them in one second if it made them a dollar more in profits. You owe them nothing. 

With that in mind, I would put my mental & emotional resources toward “checking out” & trying as hard as I could to not give a shit and using them for a paycheck for as long as you can while you ride out COVID & then look for another job.

Do the least amount of work possible & bullshit your employer as best you can to get by & then dump them (with 2 weeks notice IF POSSIBLE) when you get another job.

I know it’s hard doing bad work, but they deserve it. 

But if I’m wrong—If you know that the Board of Directors / president of the company happen to truly be good people that would have YOUR back—then of course the above doesn’t apply, but believe me they don’t. it’s nothing personal at all but that’s the reality. Companies are way more powerful than workers and the laws are in their side. They can literally, and LEGALLY, harass you as much as they want and then fire you for no reason at all, as long as it’s not based on your race, gender, etc. and you would have no recourse.

So fuck them. They are a company and you are a person you need to do what you need to do to survive. 

But I’d say definitely do NOT quit now if you can help it. You have no idea when you’ll find work again & it’s hard getting a job when you don’t have another job... just try not to give a shit and use them instead. People are so full of shit that you’ll probably blend right in anyway, and it sounds like you weren’t going to use them as a reference anyway.

In essence, treat them as they are already treating you: like shit.
It’s only fair & it balances the universe"

Also, I'd bring a laptop & be prepared to present your work in some form... your website if you have one, a case study if you have one, etc.

As for wowing the interviewer, wow them with your warmth, easygoing nature, likability. If you don't think you have these things, FAKE IT. It's all about people wanting to hire people they can imagine working with. That's it. I'm not claiming it's easy to just ""wow"" any interviewer, not at all.

But the bigger theme seems to be you not showing up for yourself - your ego - the “you” you know as “you” maybe isn’t taking control of things in life with as much forethought & intention as you would like. For example, maybe your feeling function takes over when you’re “on the spot” and it’s your time to speak up or act & you feel like you don’t perform as well as you could have.

Eventually (now) I’m done. What else do people like that expect? 

When all they do is add toxicity to your life, and don’t take responsibility for their shit, I feel like it’s the only choice.

My thinking was same as yours: when you work out your shit & are ready to apologize, great. If not, you’re just a liability and I’m enabling you and hurting myself by exposing myself to you.

I wasn’t even doing it to hurt them — even though I can’t stand them and they are emotionally abusive and don’t deserve kindness—

I did it purely out of self interest of protecting MYSELF.

I re-initiated contact again 4 years later but only out of guilt &  the thought that I’d regret it if they died.

They had corrected their behavior after that but it didn’t last. So I just had to cut them out again last week but this time it was done in anger bc they had wronged me. So it’s different feelings & situation,
But the same moral:

If having people IN your life damages you in some way, they are bad for you & toxic.
