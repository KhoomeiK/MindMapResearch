Again, if you find it's lacking, upgrading to 8GB of RAM isn't too hard on most laptops. The RAM can be bought for under $25-30 USD on eBay or Amazon and a small philips head screwdriver to open a compartment on the bottom is usually all that's needed to access the RAM (some laptops may have a RAM slot under the keyboard too, but they usually make the keyboard removable for access).

I used to record single tracks on my 2010 HP Elitebook, which has an i7 processor, but it's a 2 core/4 thread exactly like an i3-530 in laptop form factor. However, it has 8GB of DDR3 and that's really what kept me from bogging down too much while recording.

I can't believe it made it through playtesting without someone seeing how unnatural it is.

* Ibanez has their Gio lineup for the budget range but I'm a fan of their ART120 and AX120 models, which are often overlooked, but are incredible Gibson inspired rock machines for not much money (and doesn't have the Gio badge). If you want a more metal oriented model, the GRG131DX is a pretty good deal.
* Epiphone has the G400 Pro model in that price range, which is a pretty awesome guitar.

If you can, you should measure a few key areas of the nylon you are currently borrowing, such as:  


* The width of the neck at the nut 
* The distance between the two outermost string slots at the nut 
* The thickness of the whole neck at the nut and the 12th fret
* The total length of the guitar from the bottom to the very top of the headstock
* the length, width and depth of the body at their widest visible parts

Knowing the width of the nut and the space between the two outermost strings will let you know what kind of neck to look for that's better suited for you. If the neck of your borrowed nylon is too wide and you know it's 43mm, then 41 or 42mm might work better for you. Same goes for all the measurements, but not all of them are easy to get, like the thickness of the neck at the nut and 12th fret, at least not without a digital caliper. But each piece of info helps you know what to look for differently in your new guitar, not all of them are necessary but get as much as you can."

However that is overthinking things, it is theoretically damaging the speaker but it's like hitting a crack in the pavement in a brand new car.

I have his Granite bridge humbucker with A8 magnet and it's my best all round pickup, great for metal like a Duncan JB but not as high output, so it can still clean up well and that's why it's a perfect pickup for my Ibanez RG.

If you want something lower output to focus more on cleans, the Whiskey Burner is another incredible pickup I own that I recommend. However the Whiskey Sour may be better suited if you do want to get into higher gain stuff than Appetite for Destruction era Slash (just as an example). If the music you want to play was made with stock pickup Les Paul's and SG's, then either option will be more than hot enough for you.

If you got more money, the Squier Contemporary Tele, Jazzmaster or Strat have humbuckers (most of them active humbuckers) and would work even better out of the box (not need upgrades or mods to sound and play great).

Then you can keep the Jaguar in standard E or even drop C, where it might be better suited with your current string gauge. Lots of great guitar music out there in drop C to learn, like Mastodon (which is fun and challenging without being going overboard on notes per minute)."

I never really used magic much at all, so I just never had a need to find him and thought it was weird there wasn't a pyromancy vendor but never thought much further than that. I just try not to look at too many walkthroughs and spoilers but do poke into the wiki for certain things I'm stuck on, so I never knew he was there.   


Same with Shiva in Dark Souls 1, just never noticed him in multiple games and only discovered his existence while searching where to find the washing pole."

So I settled down in one spot and started farming souls to level up. In the process, I also honed my dodging skills and timing to the point I was also leveling up my human player skill too.

There’s no harm in it when it’s been a strategy in the genre since it’s infancy."

I don’t even parry, so I don’t trivialize him with that, he’s simply a boss that works well with the way I tend to play these games. So not every boss is going to be the same challenge for you as it is for other people, each boss presents it’s own unique challenges and you will find some bosses that you are worried about will seem like chumps and then wonder why people find other bosses easy because they destroy you (looking at you curse rotted Greatwood, got too cocky one too many times with it.)"

I can see it both ways, it was unsportsmanlike, but also Tony was having a rough night. He got upset after the Pettis fight because it was stopped because he wanted to prove himself more, so I’d imagine he would be even more upset when the fight is stopped for him. He lost his record breaking win streak, which also has to hurt a lot AND he lost it to an alternate opponent on short notice and not fighting Khabib for the title."
MechanicAdvice,fqa9yqm,t1_fq8ug6o,1589215441.0,"Replacement CV axles aren't too expensive unless you are on the strictest of budgets, so I wouldn't waste much more than 30 mins on the old one if it doesn't go back together well."
Guitar,fq8eqnq,t1_fq7o9jq,1589164540.0,"If you have the means to afford a decent bass, I say go for it. I had the inkling to play bass, picked up a fretless in 2019, fell in love with the instrument and now have a second fretted bass to go along with it. It hasn't become my main instrument, but I still have a lot of fun learning with it and I find myself writing an interesting sounding bassline and immediately have to pick up my guitar to write over it.

 It's a pretty great tool to have in any musicians arsenal, especially with how you can find such damn good basses for practically nothing (I recommend the Ibanez TMB100 if you aren't sure about spending a lot, but still want something well built and versatile)."

Guitar,fpyu077,t1_fpy9sln,1589009146.0,"I think the only thing I forgot to mention is intonation. I was lucky with my Jazzmaster that I was able to tighten the intonation screw enough to get it intonated well but much more and I'd need to cut down the spring and file down the screw tip so it doesn't get too close to the string. 

On my GAX30, I was able to get away with using a smaller spring from a different project and didn't have to worry about the screw tip, but just figured I'd warn you now that I thought of it. I've been pretty sleep deprived lately and spacey haha"
Guitar,fpy69h7,t1_fpy5lqu,1588996916.0,"Not a problem, I spent a lot of time experimenting with string gauges for drop C and B, so I'm always glad to be able to apply some of that to help."
Guitar,fpy4yd1,t3_gfaktw,1588996102.0,"Absolutely, I run 12-62's on my drop C guitar, which is a 24.75"" scale Ibanez GAX30 and it should be pretty nicely balanced at drop B. At drop C, they feel like the guitar did before in standard E with 10-46's. So a shot in the dark approximation for string tension would be like 9-42's in standard E on your guitar.   


I've tried a ton of gauges on my drop C guitar, started on 10-52's but felt they were too sloppy for my style of playing. I moved up to 11-56's which were better, then tried 13-56's with a wound 3rd and finally settled on the 12-62's as the best gauge for me because I like a little more tension than less.  


I didn't have to do much work to the nut slots on my Ibanez to run these gauges, same with my drop B guitar (an Affinity Jazzmaster). I have nut files, so I did clean each nut slot up but didn't take much material away to get the strings seated and moving well. Your mileage may vary, so I would plan ahead and at least buy some of those [welding tip cleaner files](https://www.amazon.com/Hobart-770084-File-Cleaners-Small/dp/B002ACOXSQ/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=welding+tip+cleaner+files&qid=1588996029&sr=8-2) you can get in a set for $10 or less. They won't be good for cutting a brand new nut, but they will get you 90% of the way there if you need to clean up or widen existing nut slots a little."
Guitar,fpy1cc3,t3_gfwh79,1588993879.0,"I was honestly never a fan of the Marshall MG's, but I haven't played one made in the last 15 years, so they may have gotten better at some point. These amps aren't without their admirers though, so give one a shot if you get the chance to play one, you might like it. 

There are amps I like that people relentlessly shit on in certain gear circles (specifically the Peavey Valveking's), so it's subjective and you should try every amp and guitar you can respectfully get your hands on (always ask nicely and never push it unless you know the person well)."
Guitar,fpxzx9p,t3_gfu55d,1588993033.0,"Me and my buddy both got guitars on the same Christmas. I got what is still the cheapest feeling guitar I've ever played and crappiest battery powered amp that China could make in the 90's and my buddy got a Washburn Strat Copy and a Peavey Envoy 110. His setup was pretty modest, but sounded like a pro setup compared to mine, but I didn't let it get me down too much. I could still rock pretty hard with my shitty stuff and wasn't progressing slower than my friend because I had bad gear, so I didn't think too hard about it, I was just happy to have a guitar all my own."
patientgamers,fpvvhk4,t1_fpvqcd4,1588952573.0,"Even the most mundane aspects of the game are satisfying to me. I like that the game forces you to plan out your day a little around eating, sleeping and staying clean. I actually like the thought of getting cleaned up before meeting with nobility, even going to the bathouses for a full wash and laundry. If I'm just handing in some poached deer meat to an innkeeper, I might consider rinsing off in a bucket but don't worry too much about it.  


There's also very few horror games as scary as travelling through the forest at night at a low level. I take it slow on my horse so I don't run into any traps, so it's very tense the whole way through, only seeing a few feet around you by torchlight. It's so intense that hearing a branch crack nearly gives me a panic attack. Then a couple dozen hours later, you don't have to worry about anything but the most massive, well equipped groups of bandits or cumans (5 or more at a time)."
patientgamers,fpvudko,t1_fpv9ucw,1588952005.0,"I felt the second was a better game to play, but the first was more densely packed with horror moments and rarely let up. TEW2 is still a pretty scary game in it's own right, but I didn't feel like stopping due to being overwhelmed like I did playing the first. That's usually a personal hallmark for me of an outstanding horror experience when I can't take anymore and have to stop at some point."
patientgamers,fpvtzwe,t3_gfp3vl,1588951805.0,"Kingdom Come and Dark Souls III are some of my favourite games of all time, both very different RPG's, but both incredible in their own way.   


Kingdom Come is not without it's bugs and performance issues, but the game underneath it all is one of the best RPG's I've ever played. Not only did I love playing the game, but it's historical setting and actual events, places and people got me reading about 15th century Bohemia when I have zero reason to be interested in the place (I'm an Inuit mechanic from rural Canada)."
