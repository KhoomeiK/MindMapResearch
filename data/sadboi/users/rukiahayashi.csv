depression,fr5jmoc,t1_fr5gte0,1589909640.0,"Eh not really. Think of emotions like a heart monitor’s lines. It goes up and down, for normal people. For most of my life, there are far more downs than ups. Every time I try so hard, and have hope, maybe it goes up for a bit. But when it falls apart, I’m just left again and again with nothing but crushing disappointment. It feels even worse cause relative to the high you suffer a huge fall. 

But if you are hopeless, I guess life just remains a flatline of numbness and depression. Which at this age, I’m starting to prefer. At least I know what to expect.

Off topic though, but I really hate it when people say depressed people are lazy or can try harder. I know for a fact that I’ve sacrificed more than most of my peers who have advanced further than me because of innate skill, family connections and looks/social skills. It’s already a curse to be born depressed and not good looking, and it’s a curse everyday to see how opportunities are handed to already normal peoples to further bolster their lovely lives."
