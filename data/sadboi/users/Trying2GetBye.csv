Also, with the introspection like u/kakkacarrotcake11 said, it‚Äôs important to sometimes take a step back as well to avoid going into a full blown panic and feelings of existential dread. Also the thing about going outside (the big outside where you can really keep that mmmcht *chef‚Äôs kiss* distance) is so true, something about sunshine and fresh air. And maybe pick up a few simple hobbies, especially ones that teach you to be patient and kind with yourself but can still take your mind off constant self-exploration. Mine was running.

That‚Äôs sick, and I don‚Äôt understand where you found the crack to force that mentality into my discourse.

I know one camgirl and that‚Äôs where my ‚Äúmaybe some girls aren‚Äôt completely torn down by it‚Äù came from.

Of course if they turn to sexwork because that‚Äôs all they have that‚Äôs terrible, I don‚Äôt revel in the fact that people to have to do sex work to survive.

I‚Äôm sure their bodies get sore like mine. All I‚Äôm acknowledging is that people are different, and I‚Äôm saying there are certainly women who have other avenues but still do sex work. What‚Äôs the explanation there? You can‚Äôt speak for all women nor can I."

Pimps and such are an entirely different story, there‚Äôs absolutely no way such an organizational work structure is healthy and should indubitably remain illegal.

But the rise of Only Fans and such allows individuals to take sex work into their own hands and while I don‚Äôt see it as a viable or sensible means of life, I won‚Äôt talk down on them or bash them for their choices, but indeed deep down inside I do wish they chose better.

And who am I to speak to what traumatizes people individually? Like the issue of hookup culture vs monogamy, one night stands work for some people and for others it leaves them feeling empty, if that make sense..."
