alcoholism,fa8z21w,t3_e80ywy,1575858233.0,"I went to a friends wedding within the first month of my sobriety and I was miserable. I couldn’t relax and have fun because all of my friends were drinking and having a good time. My partner has been super supportive and so have my friends, so that makes things easier. 

But I’m feeling the same way, like nothing is fun or exciting without the alcohol. I don’t want to go and do anything because I can’t drink. And that’s how I feel, like I am not allowed to. Which my drinking led me into a downward spiral of self harm. 
 
I’m over 60 days sober so here’s hoping life gets easier."
ptsd,f9w1y7r,t3_dy3w0c,1575685629.0,I didn’t even realize that what I was going through was actually PTSD until I was admitted into a behavioral health hospital and talked to doctors and therapist there. I just assumed that anything PTSD was related to military but it’s associated with so much more! So I definitely understand feeling discouraged about researching it because I feel shame for having it.
