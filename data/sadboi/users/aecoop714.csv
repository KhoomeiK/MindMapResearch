I can vividly recall almost daily when I was a kid diligently observing my peers and the others around me desperately trying to wrap my head around how they seemed to be able to go through life so easy or carefree or effortlessly, yet I couldn't. 
It's plagued me, my entire life spent trying to figure out WTF was wrong with me? What was I doing so differently? 

I still don't really understand to this day,  but becoming jaded & bitter has at least made it so that I don't give a fuck anymore at least."

3. He lied. Sometime after we talked about it I asked him if he was sure he didn't have any of those types of photos anymore - he told me he didn't have any, said he had already gotten rid of them long before we had a conversation about it, because, get this--haha, he thought it was inappropriate.
4. He didn't have a few forgotten random photos over 10 + years, he had a VAULT. 100's of photos & videos of women he is fucking, did fuck, or was attempting to fuck."

The only thing that separates the complex from the 711 is a Mini-Lynx Bus Hub. So you've got about five different main bus lines that run through there repeatedly from like 7am to midnight. 
While being close to public transit maybe around like a good thing - it's not. The most unsavory people just hang out around there all day. Cracks, methheads, & homeless people just roam around that entire complex because it's also  connected to the Savealot, Liquor store, etc...

A. We know what you look like, who are you trying convince that you actually look like that? And if they don't already know what you really look like what happens when they do finally see you in person?

B. If you're deriving your self worth from how many likes & comments you receive on social media, how does a overly shopped photo of you, that doesn't even look like the real you, make you feel good about yourself? They know deep down they don't actually look like that, what kind of mental illness allows you to achieve higher self esteem that way? It's no different than me posting a photo of Scarlett Johansson, saying it's me, receiving millions of likes & comments about how beautiful I am then that making feel better about my physical appearance in my daily life. 
I know I don't look like that, I think it might actually make me feel worse that all that love & attention was being given to some glorified version of myself I knew I was so desperate to be, but could never be. It's like rubbing in my face."

However the area is, very slightly, starting to feel the effects of gentrification, slowly pushing in from the prestigious Winter Park & downtown areas. They are also all about a 30-45 min commute (traffic depentant) to the Main campus of UCF. 

I live in Village Lakes. I would not recommend. 
I don't mind that the area is ghetto or that I'm prompted to buy drugs at the gas station near my apt... I'd rather that than people who are stuck up & nosy with nothing better to do then complain about what color welcome mat I use or call the cops because some kid is selling lemonade. At least people in the ghetto mind their own damn business.

The only issues have is with the Village Lakes complex is itself. The staff are awful in every way imaginable. Rude, lazy, unapproachable, disinterested & might as well be cardboard cutouts of people. 

The complex is riddled with garbage, broken glass from beer bottles & meth pipes, empty dime bags, dozens of bicycles in the ponds that were thrown in over the years, shoty construction (trying hanging a shelf up in the drywall, ha. ), plagues of mosquitos due to poor gutter design/upkeep, dog shit everywhere, the list goes on and on. 

The on property staff does zero to resolved the above issues or anything else for that matter, but they sure do make sure you're keeping in line with the rules/ policies /rent.
The facilities such as the gym or in site  laundry when open are typically broken, trashed & pathetic. 1 of the 2 pools the have has been closed for 1.5 years now.

Crippling Insecurity & self- consciousness might as well be my two best friends, but I think I look my best when I'm naked  simply based on feedback received, I'm pretty confident in my sexual abilities too.
But because I'm ridiculously insecure the thought has crossed my that mind  : what if they are just being nice or they just say that to everyone. 
So getting a critique from an unbiased outsiders perspective would finally be able to  confirm it"
trashy,f29p0qw,t3_dchgdq,1570101946.0,"Went to one of those outdated, not so clean, $1 discount theaters that show movies just leaving the regular theaters. This one was probably from 1970s so the seat backs come up just past your shoulders. 

So the theater was about half way full - a few people to each row at least. My friend & I are in the middle left, about 40 mins in a women towards then front right in full view of everyone picked her infant up, laid it down on the chair beside her & changed that kid's fucking diaper.
What did she do with the diaper, you ask? Well It earned a seat right next to her, of course! When the movie she paid $1 to see is such a cinematic fucking masterpiece that a quick bathroom trip not an option, then getting up to dispose of a shit filled sack definitely won't be interrupting her"

My veganism/animal rights lifestyle is a personal choice. I choose to this way of life because I deem it the most ethical, respectful, moral and to be honest - the most intellectually superior - way to go through life. 
To live a life I'm proud of. 
I'm passionate about & follow this path in life closer than most people ""reglious/spiritual"" do. Therefore I treat it as such : I respect everyone's own choices & religions & lifestyles. I would not constantly coversate about my own religion nor shame others for not believing the way I do - & thus what I hate about the self righteous, self-entitled vegans out there. 

Learn to teach not to shock, vilify or shame."

It may change some people's lives, and give lost individuals a sense of community but it's detriment has  life ending consequences.

That sense of community ends up becoming a exclusive, petty clique, leaves most who attempt AA feeling uncomfortable & unwelcome. 
The Loyal AA members & the AA 'BIG BOOK' relentlessly preach about a addict being  ""powerless against the substance"" ""unable to help yourself""  ""will not survive without AA"" ""complete abstinence or failure "" ect... 

These rules to live by are not in and of themselves bad, but they don't work for the majority. And telling the  person who's already at rock bottom, these things over & over again, telling them it's fact & they'll die without it - it's dangerous.

Leaves hopeless people feeling even more hopeless."
