AspiePartners,fn6x9d7,t1_fn5uv71,1586709137.0,"What we are doing is having her instead say she needs ""podcast time"" - it feels less harsh so she feels comfortable saying it, versus ""I don't want to talk."" So she puts her headphones in, listens to podcasts, and I know to not talk to her until she engages me."
HumansBeingBros,fmyism7,t3_fy4o2b,1586487177.0,"My brother was a kitchen manager at a fancy Portland restaurant (he was laid off a week or two ago). Once COVID-19 made a lot of pre-ordered kitchen supplies unnecessary, he took each employee, at the beginning of their shift, back to the fridge and encouraged them to take home excess food. I've never been prouder."
AspiePartners,fmyfxf0,t3_fxy1mx,1586485225.0,"We are working on better ways for her to let me know she needs me to basically just not talk to her for a while. It's hard for her to let me know she needs that space, and I can't quite get the hint otherwise."
OKmarijuana,fl8dtst,t1_fl88vcn,1584921418.0,Thank you!
OKmarijuana,fl88oj8,t1_fl88ke5,1584918212.0,"Thank you, I found that as well but didn't see a post talking about shutting down. Did you?"
OKmarijuana,fl880ud,t1_fl81c4v,1584917815.0,"Same, please link!"
AspiePartners,fkez13v,t1_fkeyiwi,1584123662.0,"That's a great way to think of it. I have a toothbrush with a timer so I'm now making sure I use it (in the past I haven't paid attention to that as much as I should). She is very sensitive to smells, so that's probably part of it too. Gum/mints is a good idea too. Thanks!!"

diabetes,f4p1qrk,t3_dl99bw,1571713613.0,"Listen to the signals your body is sending! If you're hungry, you probably need it."
diabetes,f1j8zvg,t1_exg2892,1569520259.0,I second the psychological thing - one poke with a sensor every 14 days vs. multiple pokes and bleeding every day. It makes me feel much better about my body and my health.
diabetes,f1j8r7c,t3_d4o92o,1569520171.0,"I know people who basically ignore their sensor readings for 12-24 hours and rely only on their monitors (I don't use the monitor that comes with the libre but you could do that). I changed out my sensor yesterday evening and now my readings are completely off - saying I am dangerously low but I feel fine and have never had significant lows, just highs. 
It makes sense to think of it as: this is a foreign object in your body, your body is going to react to that foreign body, so that can cause fluctuations. As your body adjusts, the numbers should also."
diabetes,f1j4xe6,t3_d20b8c,1569518780.0,"If 14 day, I'd be interested - the sensors help me so much with my hectic work schedule, but they're rather expensive"
OKmarijuana,eym31f1,t3_cxg4nf,1567198225.0,"Hopefully by the time he's an adult it will be legal nationwide and he will be able to not worry about moving! My partner is autistic and it's been helping her with overstimulating activities too, like haircuts or going to a festival. So thankful for this plant!"

Anxiety,etk6zao,t3_cbxky8,1562890514.0,"Please listen to yourself. You do not want kids. Maybe that'll change sure but maybe it won't! Be honest with your bf about how your feeling, tell him the topics off the table for now if you feel too pressured. If he's a good one, he'll respect your boundaries! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
SimplyFortnite,et9h62i,t1_et97cro,1562596803.0,"I absolutely agree that education is vital, but that includes educating yourself as to how this word affects others and being honest that you're speaking about this from a position of power, both as a moderator and as someone who does not, in my perception, have a very emotional or traumatic reaction to that use of the word. That's not how it is going to be for members of this community. You're right, things aren't always black and white, but you must acknowledge that holding this stance about this community is putting your LGBTQ members at risk."
SimplyFortnite,et9f09i,t1_et95d1e,1562595233.0,"Saying something/someone is gay as an insult is homophobic, even if you aren't necessarily homophobic in other aspects of your interactions with people. Just because mainstream gaming communities are more accepting of that verbage doesn't make it right.

When I hear your casual tolerance of such statements, I hear that I am not welcome in this group because my identity is worth using as an insult."
