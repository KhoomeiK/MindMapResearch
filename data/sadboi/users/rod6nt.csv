(I’m generalizing cos idk your girlfriend but I’m assuming she’s a great gal!). to conclude this response, I will affirm to you that you’re a winner, so far as I, and many others, are concerned for persisting in such tough times. much love to you and have a great day♥️"

Anxiety,fltgleq,t1_flteykp,1585471970.0,"I understand your pain as I have been in a situation very similar to yours, and I empathize with your need to not hurt your mother. dear redditor, I want you to live because a person so compassionate to the point that he/she would live in a state of anxiety just to make sure that their mother doesn’t have to face grief deserves to stay alive. the sacrifices you’ve made matter and in my eyes (and those of many others, I’m certain) you’re a hero for your persistence. also, if you feel like your mother is resilient in the face of such a matter or you generally feel okay confiding in her, I would suggest that you fill her in on what’s going on. the parents of many who have chosen to take their lives say their only regret was that they didn’t reach out to their children or vice-versa before the time came. (ofc this is a generalization and correct me if you feel like I’ve misinterpreted anything). I would also like to add that my dms are open if you ever feel like talking (but this in no way is a proper substitute to professional help services online or otherwise, which is always ideal). please remember that you have the support of an entire community here, and are by no means alone. take care, friend!

I don’t have all the answers, far from it, really, but as a general truth you must realize that when you’re at the trough of a wave there’s a crest to look forward to. there is always something that glimmers in the darkness and obscurity of life.

ImposterSyndrome,f6liaru,t3_dn33uw,1572946567.0,"I just found out about this sub, so forgive me for not finding your post earlier.
who says that academic dexterity and intrinsic intelligence aren’t interrelated in some way? to me, your ability to overcome short-term obstacles (like exams, per se) is a clear sign of cleverness, because not everyone is capable of maneuvering (successfully) past something so stressful and draining.
adapting to different environments is difficult, and maybe you feel like the college-level physics lab class is more challenging than prior academic experiences, but I promise you that that’s fine and totally normal.
adaption to diverse circumstances is an evolutionary trait of mankind, so use it to your advantage! 
do what you have to do, and make sure you know your material well, and that’s enough. eventually, you will feel a sense of belonging because:
you ARE intelligent.
you ARE academically smart.
and you WILL by, all means, be able to perform greatly in your class!
hope your test went well & wishing you all the best💗"
