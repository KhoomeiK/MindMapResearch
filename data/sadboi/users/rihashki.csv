dating_advice,f2ze344,t3_deullk,1570516906.0,"I’ve (24F) never actually dated multiple people at once because ... I guess because I have never been interested in doing so, but if I start to like someone I’ve gone on a few dates with and it’s “too early” to be exclusive, I just communicate where I’m at: basically that I’m being monogamous and that if they aren’t (and that’s okay), just please let me know. That way I can make an informed decision about what I want to do."
