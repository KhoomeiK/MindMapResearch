cuboulder,fnhjwxd,t1_fnh2xco,1586963773.0,"You obviously didn't read what I wrote because you just reworded what I already said. Either that or you just outright don't understand what I'm asking for here. I specifically said that the degree audit tells you how you're going to get your degree and it's up to you to decide when you're going to take the classes.

I'm not saying that you shouldn't contact counselor. I never said that you shouldn't be putting thought into what classes you take. I'm not saying that we should be letting a program decide what classes we should take. Ultimately yes, it should be up to the students. My point is that it doesn't need to be a drawn-out a long process. It doesn't it really doesn't. 

 I said multiple times that the suggestions the computer provides don't need to be perfect because you can always go back to change it before you finalize your schedule. You don't need to approve the suggestions that the computer provides either.

 And yes, CU does provide feedback on professors. No it's not other websites that do that. Our own university asks for and processes that data. We all provide feedback on courses and instructors in the FCQ that's at the end of all of our classes every single semester. 

Here, this is pulled directly from the cu-boulder website. ""Every term, students on the Boulder, Colorado Springs and Denver campuses evaluate each of their courses and instructors using a questionnaire called the Faculty Course Questionnaire (FCQ).Â The FCQ program is managedÂ within theÂ Office of Data AnalyticsÂ at CU Boulder."" 

There's no reason why they wouldn't be able to use that information to provide data in course selection. Hell the whole reason that I made this post was because I was filling out a form asking if this was something the students wanted. They're already working on it. It's not asking too much for them to just correlate and consolidate this information. Give me one reason. 

Hating buff portal is just a meme in reality, it isn't that bad. What people are really saying is ""change bad"" or ""me no like change"". This is a trial run. This is the first year that it's been implemented so of course there's going to be challenges to overcome. But overall I like the system. They consolidated multiple websites into one place. They can do it again. 

 You're not arguing against my points. Instead you're saying that I'm wrong, without providing evidence to prove the contrary. That's insulting. Read what I wrote. You want to talk about how it's our responsibility to not be lazy as students. Refute my argument then by reading what I wrote. Go ahead. It's right there."
cuboulder,fngh1ap,t1_fnfrbc2,1586931973.0,"I think you're misunderstanding the point that I'm trying to make. There's also a contradiction between what you're saying there. You're saying it's our job to be the one to decide what classes to take but it's the degree audit that tells you what classes that you need to take in order to get your degree. 

Sure you can pick and choose when you want to take the class but you're still going to need to take ""x y and z"" in order to graduate.  I'm just saying that we should use that information in the selection of our courses in a more automated way in order to streamline the process. There should be a generic shopping cart for my degree based on variables. 

Information's already there. It's just not being applied. You would just need a series of factors like past classes that are taken, the grades in those classes, how many credits you still need, the degree audit, and so on. Of course you would still be able to go in and change it. Why in the hell can't the system know that you have two majors??? I don't see how that's a problem at all. It wouldn't make the process any more difficult than it already is. All we're shooting for here is a foundation. 

If a human can do it, a computer can also. It just needs to be programmed. It doesn't need to be a perfect schedule since you can always change it later. Look, not everyone is double majoring with a minor while trying to get a certificate. Most of us out here are just simple one track majors. A lot of us are here just to get a degree and get a job. Not everyone is an overachiever. I'm not saying that we should revert back to high school. Reading that was honestly offensive and condescending. 

I hate spending an entire day researching classes. Yes it's our responsibility as students but that doesn't mean it needs to be a drawn-out and complicated process. It always takes multiple tabs because I have to check my degree audit and email my counselor and read reviews of the professors and compare class times with my Google calendar to see if it conflicts with my work schedule. 

The suggestions don't need to be exactly what you need they just need to be close enough. The whole point is to minimize the time that it takes to research classes. It wouldn't be ""an absolute mess"" if the person that created the website knew what they were doing. That's why I think you don't understand what I was shooting for here.

I'm just saying that the process could be better if administration was more intelligent about it. They could absolutely modernize the system without sacrificing the liberties that we deserve as students. Instead it feels like I'm using dial up in the 1990s every time I try to register for classes."
