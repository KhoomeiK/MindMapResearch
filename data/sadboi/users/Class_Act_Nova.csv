Dani isn't even the problem, because I think her mom makes her do it. She is getting half naked in front of a camera for an audience of young girls, who think you have to like exactly like Dani (photoshopped Dani) to be pretty, and weird old men. There's lots of evidence showing that Dani is 13 and that her mom is making her sell herself on Youtube and Instagram. And yeah, maybe she likes the fame, but I don't think she likes working 24/7. I honestly feel bad for her and her dad. Her dad and his new wife (Heather, I believe) tried to take them (Dani and her mom) to court many times so that he could spend more time with Dani and so that they could sort out the ""content situation."" But, since Dani and her mom are basically millionaires they just paid off the court. Dani's dad almost never gets to see her. Heather even started a GoFundMe for Dani so that she could stop making content, but she made Heather take it down.
