Yes to diaper sprayer. I didn't have one with my first baby and there is a night and day difference in terms of convenience and ease of cleaning.

You're right that our prison system is broken and that trans people are often treated unfairly. It's also valid to be fearful of gang related retaliation.

In some ways it's great that so many people have no knowledge of how sadistic people can be. I sometimes wish I didn't. Some people depend on that world view to get through life and feel confident that they can face the world. When a person comes to them with information that contradicts that world view, downplaying it or pretending to be an expert can be used as a defence. It's an attempt to control uncontrollable things. 

If this person isn't directly involved with your therapy work, I would stop engaging in discussions about your trauma with them. It's likely they don't know their way of discussing it is traumatic in itself, but that doesn't mean they should go on doing it.

Just for example, you were walking around your childhood home telling yourself it's okay and no one else was there even though it felt like there was. That's a lot like living with PTSD. We can tell ourselves it's not happening anymore but that doesn't effectively stop the visceral response to triggers. Someone grabbing you from the room where the abuse happened kind of depicts the feeling that it could happen or is happening again, like a flashback.
