I can sympathize on the retainers. They can be very strange feeling. My friend switched me to open domes and then I tried a large size. They're the phonak open dome 4.0. My receivers stay in my ears so much better now. Discuss the retention issue with the folks at Costco, maybe there is a different dome you can try. 

Regarding your headphones. What kind do you use? On the ear cans might not work well for you anymore. I have to use over the ear cans. I have an over abundance of headphones from earbuds, on ears, over ears (both open and closed back). The overs work the best for me. But! My cousin has a REALLY cool pair of bluetooth bone conduction headphones and he LOVES them. 

Regardless what you decide to do, I wish you the best of luck. If you ever want to chat, shoot me a message. If I cant come up with a good answer, I'll ask my audiologist.

I'm not sure of your age, but you sound relatively young, like myself. I got my first set of hearing aids at 26 and they made a remarkable difference for me. I could hear! It was amazing! But then it hit me. I'm 26, I have 45db of hearing loss across the board in both ears, and I am now a hearing aid user. 

At first, yes. It sucked. I was sad and disappointed. But, as I grew accustomed to my hearing aids (phonak audeo b90-r, by the way), I noticed the quality of my life slowly increase. 

Nobody can invalidate the way you feel nor can they invalidate your hearing loss, no matter the degree.

tangsoodo,fizz0d1,t3_fadmii,1582881130.0,"Fun fact, I started my first dojang in this very hall in Southgate, Michigan.  It used to be a USW union hall.  When I started teaching here in 2011, the only thing that had changed from when this photo was taken to now was the carpeting on that ""stage,"" the large portrait of President Kennedy was replaced by a USW logo, and half the hall was blocked off because they leased the space to the STRANGEST church I've ever seen.  When the church moved out, my dojang took over the space.  I had over 2000 sqft of carpeted training space, a locked place to store equipment, and a place for my dojang family to learn and grow.

I instructed students in that facility up to, if I recall correctly, 5th gup before we had the student base and the budget to move into our first brick and mortar location.

The first time I saw this picture, I freaked out.  I pulled it up on my iPad and we spent a good chunk of each class that day talking about Moo Duk Kwan history, identifying the ""famous"" people in the photo, and when I got to my seniors, their eyes lit up when they found out they trained in the same place that Chuck Norris took his Master Test.

This picture and others from other trainings and testings in this facility will always hold a special place in my heart.

1- How long have you worn hearing aids? 

Since October 2019, so about 4 months.

2- How long did you suspect a hearing loss before you started using hearing aids? 

Quite some time, really.  My wife noticed I was constantly having people repeat themselves.  So... 3ish years.

3- How many hours per day do you use your hearing aids? 

About 16-17 hours.

4- What type of facility did you purchase your hearing aids? (hospital, ENT clinic, big box store, private practice, online, etc)

Here's a unique one.  They were gifted to me by my friend who owns a private practice.

 5- Did you do any research prior to purchasing your hearing aids? If so, where did you look and what did you find?

None whatsoever.

 6- On a scale of 1-10, how reliable have your hearing aids been?

9.  They've required some adjustments and a bit of getting used to.  But there was one incident where they weren't quite situated in their charger.  (Phonak Audeo B90-r)  It was probably operator error.

 7- What situations do you feel like you benefit most from your hearing aids?

Noisy or crowded situations.

8- What complaints do you have about your hearing aids?

I can hear the noise floor in my right ear.  But I probably just need to have another adjustment done.

 9- How do your family members or loved ones feel about your hearing aids?

My family was shocked I needed them.  I'm 26, my parents are in their 60's.  They both have better hearing than I do.  I'm in the 45ish-db range on my audiogram pretty much across the spectrum.  My parents are practically at 0.

 10- Rank these in order of importance when purchasing hearing aids. Hearing Aid Brand Price Education of Provider Service Package Hearing Aid Features 

Education of Provider, Service Package, Features, Brand, Price

11- Do you feel like your hearing aids lived up to what your provider told you to expect?

Beyond that.  The difference was and is night and day.  I couldn't believe what I was missing, nor could I believe how badly I hated my voice.

 12- If you had to buy hearing aids again, what would you do differently?

I would have done it sooner.

 13- Would you recommend hearing aids to family members or loved ones? 

If they're necessary, yes.  You get glasses or contacts when you can't see.  Why neglect your ears?

14- Is there anything else you would like to say about your hearing aids?  

It's tough being young, not deaf, and living with hearing aids.  However, hardly anyone notices them unless I point them out.  They were a bit tough on the tops of my ears, but I've gotten used it.  Now, I HATE  leaving the house without them."

As far as your roundhouse goes, you know how your non kicking leg is supposed to rotate 180⁰ away from your target? For a lot of folks, that inhibits the high kick. It requires flexibility in both legs at the same time. Where something like a front kick, is just one leg and relies a lot on your hamstrings and glutes. Two muscle groups that aren't too difficult to stretch. 

Stretching in a side split position will help, overtime. But as always, take it slow. You can also stretch with a partner. A proper side kick and roundhouse use the same muscle groups to achieve a high kick. So grab something to hang on to, stand in a side kick position, and have your partner slowly stretch your leg upwards. Try this before and after training to get the most benefit."

Savannah's is now Closed
Friday, at the start of dinner service 3 out of 4 critical kitchen staff quit, without provocation or explanation and walked out. This left us unable to prepare meals for our customers. We were forced to close and cancel reservations we had over the next 2 weeks until our scheduled closing date.  The 3 former employees did this maliciously and with cruel intent. Just days earlier, all 3 said they were staying until our scheduled close. They have caused serious loss of wages to our entire staff, enormous expense to Savannah's and the loss to the many customers who planned on visiting one more time.  We are struggling to understand the reason this was so hurtfully done. We had just purchased orders for food, wine, liquor to keep us fully stocked over the next two weeks.

You have your battle buddy for your own happily ever after. Sounds amazing right? Well, frankly it is. 

Where does the sadness come in?

When your partner has a bad day, loses a job, loses a pet, loses another loved one, loses a parent, or, God forbid, loses a child. These times introduce heart break. There will be many days where you wonder to yourself, ""why am I continuing with this? Have I made a mistake?"" 

Why do we subject ourselves to this turmoil when being single forever would be much easier? Because we finally found the person that we love more than ourselves; that person who we cannot imagine our lives without. 

I've been married to my best friend for just over a year now. Frankly, our fledgling marriage has been tested, more than we could have imagined. 1 day after our honeymoon, my wife had to put down her horse, her horse was nearly 28 years old, my wife was 30. 1 month after our wedding, my wife's grandmother passed away. 6 months after our wedding, our world was shattered when we got the call that we needed to leave Florida and get to Ohio immediately. I put my wife on a plane and I drove. My wife's mother was rapidly losing her 18 year battle with pancreatic cancer. My wife made it in time to say goodbye, I did not. 

Strange as it may sound, as difficult as the last year of our young lives has been, it has brought us closer together than we were.  I have done my best to be the rock of support that my wife needs. Why?  Because I love my wife more than anything else in this world. I'm proud to call this beautiful woman my wife and I would go to hell and back for her in an instant. 

Love is wonderful. But it is not always sunshine and roses. Love can be painful, but it is the painful moments and how those strengthen your relationship is what defines your love for each other."

EDIT: [Here is the video I used. ](https://youtu.be/lHCLFK2bDPM) Be sure to figure out your VM's IP and properly set up the port forwarding."
AirMessage,faumov9,t1_fau8fwb,1576349712.0,That'll do it then. You need to log into your router and open up the port that is listed on the Airmessage website.
AirMessage,fau8c67,t1_fau7ilq,1576345571.0,Did you open the correct port on your firewall and forward it to your VM's IP address?
AirMessage,fau7a3r,t1_fat7dv8,1576345201.0,"I used VMware player, a dynamic DNS service to monitor public IP address changes, a static IP for my VM inside my network, and opened the correct port for the communication. As a little extra insurance, I also have my desktop and networking equipment on a UPS. Itll run everything for about an hour or so before it gives up the ghost during a power outage. I also followed a fantastic YT tutorial to accomplish it. If I can find the video again, I'll link it"

EDIT: for anyone having issues, [this video](https://youtu.be/lHCLFK2bDPM) is what I used to get my VM set up."

tangsoodo,fajeqtm,t3_e9dau8,1576134371.0,"Facebook is an awesome resource.  Someone already mentioned The Dojang, but there is another one that is run by Master Dan Bernardo.  It's ""Tang (Dang) Soo Do Analysis and Application.""  It is fantastic.  Another group that I am in, it's not strictly Tang Soo Do, but it is open to multiple arts.  It's called ""Kata Exchange.""  Just a place to share various forms.  Check them out.  Both of those groups are fantastic.  Oh!  When you become a Master, there is also one group called ""The Kodanja.""  If there are any seniors here that want to connect with other Kodanja across the world, this is a great place to do it."
