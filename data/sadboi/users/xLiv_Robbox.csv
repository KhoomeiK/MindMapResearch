Petloss,f32s63d,t3_dfet41,1570624284.0,"Aw sweetie, I feel so much heartache for you. Joey was such a huge part of your life, everything you’re feeling now is 100% normal, it’s okay to cry and feel empty. I lost one of my bunnies last week, she played a special part in my life just like how Joey did for you. I still cry everyday because I miss her so much. It will feel weird not being able to see them but you aren’t alone, they are still there, just in spirit. I wish I could take away the pain for you and everyone else who has lost a pet but remember you can grieve for as long as you feel you need to and remember you gave Joey as much love and care ever! If this will bring you any comfort cuddle anything you have of his such as toys, blankets, bed etc. I gave my rabbit two teddies and I haven’t let them go. Keep an eye out for little white feathers, I keep finding them by my bunnies grave and it brings me comfort knowing she is okay. I’m so sorry for your loss, stay strong❤️"
Crystals,f32q7tv,t3_dfey2r,1570622359.0,"I personally wouldn’t return it as it’s still a beautiful crystal but that’s my opinion. I understand that cracks and imperfections can cause a lot of unwanted bother, (I struggle with OCD and imperfections on things bother me also but I’ve started to appreciate imperfections on things like crystals now) If the cracks in the Crystal bother you that much and you’re becoming unhappy with the purchase I would then start to consider returning it. The issue is when buying crystals they’re bound to have imperfections, you will probably never get a genuine crystal without any imperfections such as cracks, scratches, chips etc, but with the right care the cracks won’t get worse and break off, if you can eventually get over the fact it has its imperfections and start seeing the beauty in those imperfections then I would keep it but If you’re really unsure on what to do maybe have a think about it and think is it worth returning it as you’ll have to pay for postage and packaging that might cost a lot. Like I said it’s a beautiful crystal and I wouldn’t return it :) Good luck!"
Petloss,f32nqj9,t3_df5bjy,1570619561.0,"I’m so so sorry for your loss! Losing a pet is honestly one of the worst feelings anyone could go through but only a few people understand why people get so upset over a pet passing over. A week ago yesterday I lost one of my rabbits, the last few weeks of her life were really difficult because one day she suddenly lost all mobility in her back legs, the vet said she could still have a good quality of life even though she was disabled so didn’t really see a reason to put her to sleep. I was so relieved, she had her own little corner in my room where she would chill, my boyfriend and I had to help her with moving and going to the toilet so she needed 24/7 care which we were okay doing for her. Last Tuesday I woke up and she had sadly passed over the rainbow bridge. I still can’t believe it, it’s weird not having her in my room or having to help her with things. I miss that. I keep finding white feathers around where I buried her, If you find one it’s your girl telling you she’s okay. I know words can’t take away your pain but remember you gave her the best life and remember it’s okay to grieve, please don’t feel like you have to stop grieving! Grieving doesn’t have a time on it. Stay strong❤️"

Petloss,f2rccrk,t3_dc42xm,1570371813.0,"I understand this pain so so much. I lost one of my bunnies on Tuesday. She was mine and my boyfriends child, she relied on us for so much as she was paralysed from the waist down for the last few weeks of her life. I don’t know what caused her paralysis but we think it’s what took her aswell. We had to help her go to the toilet and move around, but she was extremely happy in herself, even the vet said that when we took her to get a diagnosis for her paralysis. We moved Muffin indoors from being an outdoor bunny, she had her own place in our bedroom. My boyfriend found her in her corner Tuesday morning and she had passed over. I was and still am heartbroken, I am really struggling to come to terms with her loss, even after burying her. I just want to hold her again. I miss having her crawl over to me and sit next to me or lie on my lap and start licking my hand. What makes it harder is the fact my boyfriend is struggling too, I’ve never seen him cry over an animal until we lost Muffin and he’s dealt with the loss of pets before but he never struggled as much as he is now. He loved her just as much as I did. Everyday we always go and sit with her, I talk to her all the time and tell her how much we loved her and how much of a special bunny she was. I know this really doesn’t help ease the pain but you have to think they are at peace now in a better place, death is not the end! Keep a look out for any signs, like feathers, your cats name, other animals, smells etc. Me and my boyfriend keep finding small white feathers at Muffins resting place and her name has been mentioned in tv shows. I believe this is her comforting me and looking after me. Please stay strong, you gave your kitty the best life❤️"
