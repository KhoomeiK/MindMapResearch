It is both sex shaming a shit ton of people, but especially abuse survivors who happen to be into bdsm and making light of actual real fucking abuse. Also, a petty thing, but the honeymoon period refers to the grooming period where an abuser is sweet and kind BEFORE any abuse begins. Of course, that looks different from abuser to abuser. What they are referring to is basically gaslighting. Wherein after a period of extreme abuse, the abuser will either act like nothing happened and they love you, or that you did something bad and the abuse the inflicted was just a natural and even loving reaction to what you did. That's not fucking aftercare. Aftercare is actually caring for the sub to make sure they transition well out of such intense events in a healthy way, and to just cuddle, care for any physical issues like bruising or just generally cleaning up. This just gets to me, because, as an abuse survivor, I was literally trained to doubt my own sanity, that's how they got away with abusing me. Because I doubted my own feelings and perception. And now, these people, have the gall, to imply, that abuse survivors like myself who are also into bdsm and every woman that is into bdsm, that we can't trust our own feelings, that we can't be trusted to enjoy our bodies and our sexuality. This isn't concern over the wellbeing of women in the bdsm world, this is just another form of gaslighting for the purpose....of hating men? It's so stupid I feel stupid for saying it. Also, I love the fact that they ignore all the male and nb subs, who either have male or female or nb doms and who use aftercare. Ugh, admittedly I'm probably too steamed about this.

GenderCritical,fk31q9k,t1_fk2sp3a,1583814936.0,"Oh, my you are full of logical fallacies today, aren't you? But I'll ignore that because honestly while it is indicative of the level of reason that has been applied to this it does not directly pertain to what I actually want to address. 
I'll grant you that there have likely been some girls that transitioned because of severe internalized sexism. But that is NOT the norm or even a significant enough portion of assigned at birth females who transition to raise a stink every time someone transitions or comes out. Abuse is certainly a problem, but not directly related to this, at least not in the way you seem to think it is. And the fact that you would presume that I know so little about the effects of abuse on women and girls is galling. By your logic, I should be transitioned myself. I should be so ashamed and disgusted with my female body and identity that I would rather pretend to be a man (and I am not referring to actual trans men). So tell me? What was it that turned me trans? Or made me hate myself so much? Was it the woman that raped me from the age of four to seven? Was it the twenty years of parental abuse? Was it the boyfriend that raped me? You tell me. Except, wait, I'm not trans, nor have I ever wanted to be a man. I have certainly hated myself enough. And in fact, experience a psychological disorder similar to the gender dysphoria you despise so much. But it has nothing to do with my gender or wanting to be a different gender. You see, you not only seem to have very harmful ideas of exactly how women and girls should feel and react to abuse but you also seem to have a deep hatred for men. Which at times is frankly warranted. Your focus is only on people born female and transitioned to male. You seem to think they need saving, which you will somehow achieve by humiliating them by misgendering, deadnaming, and accusing their loved ones of abuse and completely invalidating a large chunk of their identity. But if trans men are so misguided, then why are trans women predators and abusers? Because you see them as men. And as such, they are dirty and evil and out to get you, even though they most certainly are not. You can still demean and abuse the trans men because you see it as helping them to return to the fold. Because you still see them as women. But you see that abuse that YOU are perpetuating as a good deed, so much so that you see me or anyone questioning that as bad people, or at least in your own words, someone who needs to look deep inside, or whatever bullshit it was you said. And as for the lumping bit you did. I will lump LGB people in with trans. There's a reason the two were put together in the first place. Because we're all part of a community of people who have been prosecuted, murdered, abused, legislated out of existence, misunderstood, and accused of being predators, perverts, and the general spawn of hell. I have had that very ""abuse did it to you!"" argument used against me to discredit my sexual orientation and you, my friend are the ones who should be taking a damn long look inside until you realize, that you are just like those people. You are just like the religious fundamentalists that try beating the gay out of us, you are just like the people that try to psychoanalyze us and tell us that it was that person that hit us too much, or it's because we were too close to our mom or our dad. When you say that it is because of abuse, and when you bully and belittle and abuse trans people and every decent person that simply thinks they deserve to exist in peace, you are the same as the hellfire and brimstone preachers, and the abusive parents, and the slimy politicians, and the cops that wrongfully arrest and abuse, and the gay panic users. You have become the villain to a lot of people. But you don't see it. Or you don't care. Because you're so wrapped up in your fear and your anger and hate, that you can't or won't listen to people that aren't in your bubble. Worse than that, you can't even afford human decency to the people you don't agree with. You cause pain and anguish to a lot of trans people. You are a part of a circle of abuse that gets trans kids and trans women murdered. YOU are a part of that. Your rhetoric might even impact and influence someone who is going to wind up brutally murdering a trans person, which will then go un-investigated and ignored and praised by nazis and right-wing extremists. I hope one day you can see the damage you do and make it up to all the wonderful people you hurt."

And then it was excluding women of color (although that probably happened simultaneously as barring black men from voting). Their excuse was, a mixture of overt racism and ""once we have our freedom we can better help them gain theirs"". And that sentiment has just carried on through the years. Of gatekeeping who could be a part of the group, who could benefit from the unity and even who qualified as a woman.

Anarchy101,fimazkb,t1_fimawx7,1582523521.0,Yeah I really hope so.
Anarchy101,fima5f6,t1_fim6pum,1582522751.0,"Yeah. And another kicker is. When you sign up for a class you get a list with all the required materials. I signed up and bought the required book (85$) then I start the class and start the course work only to find that not only was this the wrong fucking book, but the correct texts, were just provided as a pdf for FREE. And I cannot return the previously bought text because it is out of the wrapper. 85 fucking dollars down the drain."
Anarchy101,fim9uiu,t1_filxxcl,1582522484.0,Ooo! Thank you!
Anarchy101,fim9rb2,t1_filxkh7,1582522402.0,"Yeah I think youre right. I'll try and skip over some of it where I can and just treat it like I do my dad's ""this is who you need to vote for"" talks."
Anarchy101,fim9ol5,t1_filr81y,1582522333.0,"Yeah, all the YouTube videos are kind of weird. My professor doesnt even care, just slalps some poor audio YouTube videos from all over and an article or two and that's it. Im so disappointed. But hey at least I know my critical thinking skills are in order since I pjcled it up so fast. Incredibly ironic that the class trying to teach me how to think critically and think on my own, is also telling me precisely how to think and dressing it up as nector from the philosophy gods."
Anarchy101,fim9eiq,t1_filqkli,1582522081.0,"Yes, I'm sorry, I was caught between being horrorfied by it and also having to complete all of that coursework. I believe it was a bit of both. The text I had to read contained a combination of actual logic and argument construction. But was peppered here and there with comments like ""the young people of today are too consumed by their ""rights"" and not enough with their responsibilities."" And actually quite a fee snide remarks like that, and then a weird section about success, which was ambiguous enough for me to pass on. But then the video material was absolute bullshit. Like Jordan Peterson meets Elon Musk meets a cheesy self help YouTube video. It was bizzare. Lots of snide remarks towards people with mental health issues. It basically all boiled down to, it doesnt matter if you have no money or no education, just become a millionaire! Thank fuck there wasn't much of that included in the actual submitted work due. I just hope there isn't going to be anymore weird self help sections ""become and entrepreneur and everything will be fine"". Oh fuck I nesrly forgot, there was literally a sectiin on how to influence and manipulate people to want your ""brand""."
SandersForPresident,fi5xgoi,t3_f6fsiq,1582172853.0,"Hey, young super leftist woman, and fuck I'm so happy to see this. I've grown up with an incredible amount of respect and love for my elders. I always thought my dad was one of the smartest people I would ever meet. But now I'm older and despite my fathers best attempts at keeping me a pure woman under his control seeing the world through his eyes, and I'm honestly horrified. I know it is likely antithetical, but I've been genuinely hurt not only by the lies I have been fed or at least the rose colored glasses forced on me, but by how much I trusted my father and boomers like him to be wise and kind. So thank you, I have no idea how old you are, but it's nice seeing someone who is on the very conservative side seeing the extreme danger of this president and of how the system treats the overwhelming majority of the population. Welcome to the Bern. And also, he'll yeah! Arm the proletariat!"
