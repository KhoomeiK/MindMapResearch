I am so thankful we have universal healthcare - if it could cover everything, it'd be fantastic. I mean they cover the lenses for my glasses but not the frames. If you need two hearing aids, they only cover one and the cheapest option. 

If you don't have private health insurance, you have access to the public health insurance which is also strange... For teeth fillings, they only cover the grey ones unless it's your four front teeth (top or bottom). They don't cover everything at the dentist.

There's definitely *holes* there. I wish it covered more but if all workplaces offer health insurance, there's a decent balance...

Also the scarp book...

It happens that someone who's been there for you through a lot just isn't the one. Some people are the journey and not the destination. That isn't necessarily the case for this relationship but sometimes, it's easy to forget that life isn't always so clear cut.

I'm glad what I said could make sense to you. I hope you're able to find a compromise and make each other happy."
AgeGap,fpc7m9a,t1_fp0cf17,1588490343.0,Thank. You. Haven't seen any of the other posts but this screams toxicity to me. I'm also of the opinion cheating can almost never be forgiven... But the partner's reaction is even more cause for concern.
AgeGap,fpc797q,t3_gc35mz,1588489985.0,"I think it's so important to remember that your partner's needs are NOT your responsibility and that it's okay to be selfish sometimes.

You need to put your own needs and mental health first. 

If your partner doesn't believe they'll ever be in a relationship again if you break up, that's okay. It's on them if they want to stay single. His depression is also not your responsibility. If they need help, they can reach out to professionals. What I mean is that life will go one after if you choose that breaking up is the right option. Don't stop yourself because of someone else's needs."
AgeGap,fpc6w0i,t3_gcgwuf,1588489620.0,"Alright, so if I may be a little bit of devil's advocate here. You say that you would do anything for him, yet you wouldn't consider not going in the military or doing long-distance. That's not a bad thing necessarily, by the way. I'm just pointing out that maybe you both have certain things you're unwilling to part. 

Now, I don't think relationships should be about doing *anything* for the other person. This is just my opinion, but I wouldn't want my partner to bend to my every whims like a dandelion in the wind. I want someone who also knows what they want but is willing to compromise with me and find solutions that are appropriate for the issue.

All this being said, from what I gather in your post, I fell that maybe you haven't tried to find a compromise and tried to sway his mind more than anything. It's perfectly okay but I believe you're now at the point of trying to settle for a compromise, if you find one you're willing to live with.

I don't have any great tips, I just think you shoumd talk to your partner, lay the facts and your ideas of what you want, then ask what his bigger oicture looks like and try to join those roads together."

suggestmeabook,fp8s8fy,t1_fp8o8ja,1588401278.0,I still refuse to read it again (and it's been years). I was so angry because of the ending... It's a masterpiece but I'm still mad. That book along with Flowers for Algernon were a shaping moment for me. And who would've thought I've gone on to work with adults with intellectual disabilities.
suggestmeabook,fp8s3a3,t1_fp8ei5p,1588401143.0,"It's the best book ever! I remember when I was really young and couldn't really read, I'd pretend I was reading it. I read in school multiple times and on my own another handful of times. It's just so beautiful and real."
AskReddit,fp565ks,t1_fp4eogu,1588317625.0,That sounds like *heaven* !!!! Why have I mever thought of that?
AskReddit,fp563eg,t1_fp2i4fc,1588317565.0,I'm from Canada and I thought it was HILARIOUS that they sold single portion pickles. But it bithered me because I eat a whole jar of pickles in a sitting if there's no one to stop me. Pickles in Canada are so much smaller... I love going to the US for pickles of a good size.
AskReddit,fp4nsr2,t1_fp189p1,1588303129.0,Canadian here and my grandpa's family eats sugar pie with a slice of tourtiere on top... Reminded me of that. I've meber tried because it freaks me out. Haha!

aww,fp0kxy3,t1_fp0k739,1588211352.0,"It's an amazing movie! I work with adults with sepcial needs so I LOVE a good representation of their life. It's not all butterflies and sunshine obviously. Some clients will be negative about their situation, others like the teen in the movie will make the best of it. That movies was amazing. The part that hooked me in was when Paul Rudd as the caregiver was interviewed to work with this teen. I can't remember if the teen or mom asks this but something like how will you wipe his/my ass. And he says something along the lines of I'll wipe your ass in such a way that when I'm done there will not be a speck of shit left on it. It really showed the raw beauty of this work. 

Sorry long comment. I'm just very passuonate about this :)"
aww,fp0gfjx,t1_fp04xz6,1588208768.0,"Best. Movie. Ever. By the way!!!! I loved that they didn't pity the teen and make it all emotional, sad and depressing. It was raw and at some points tugged at my heartstrings. But the humour was what I appreciated the most and how the teen was portrayed as an equal rather than superior or inferior."
