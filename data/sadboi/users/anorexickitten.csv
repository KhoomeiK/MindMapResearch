depression,fqgcgcd,t3_giqd23,1589342815.0,having fish for a number of years is quite the accomplishment and you should feel proud of yourself for taking care of them as well as you did. What happened to them was truly not a result of anything negligent on your part. Thank you for taking care of those animals as well as you did.
depression,fqg4jj6,t3_ginymg,1589337825.0,I'm in this same situation right now. You want to be heard and understood. It really sucks when people blow us off. I don't know what to make of it either. I always tell myself I won't share feelings after I get a response I don't want but what is the response I want? I don't think we know what we want when we are spiralling.
EDanonymemes,fqaxbq8,t3_ghop6e,1589226892.0,I literally wrote coca cola when I heard they were changing the formula of coke Zero. It was pretty much all that sustained me at that time. I was in a literal panic over it because I'm pretty sure I had an addiction to the stuff. This meme hits home lol
EatingDisorders,fmuvpal,t1_fmugi83,1586399934.0,"I never thought about this perspective before. I can say, reading OP - it's exactly what I have gone through/go through and I haven't linked it to misogyny but I see how that could be so. We do compare ourselves to others, scrutinize ourselves but for what? to what standard? So I just wanted to thank you for expressing this, because, in a way, it will help me let go of some of that self-hatred."
BingeEatingDisorder,fjf30fn,t3_fcrvzd,1583283216.0,I'm literally exactly where you are and had the same experience and 3veb currently the same weight and struggling. I wish I could just turn it off and get back to 150. Just know you're not alone even if I couldn't offer you any help.

AnorexiaNervosa,f7bwznc,t3_dv9wug,1573579500.0,"It's obvious that there was a projection onto you of your mothers own feelings about herself. My mother was a former bulimic and I was an overweight child. She would often tell me about her struggles to stay thin especially around the time of her wedding. She wouldn't degrade me or put me down for my weight but always made me feel like I had to be ashamed for being fat, trying to cover me up in the biggest clothes she could by as if to say sorry to everyone who had to bare witness to my size. 

Like yourself, I too sat in the corners of change rooms and hid in the darkness from my partners to not reveal my rolls and fleshy bits. 

Occasionally, my mother would make a dig at me about my size. They were so infrequent and rare, however when they came out of her mouth they were so unbelievably hurtful. 

I vividly remember one time where she yelled at me about whether my stomach was ""too fucking fat for me to bend over"" and pick something off the floor. 

I am no longer that overweight child. I know that I didn't have it that bad in the house but I was taught to be ashamed for who I am. Now that I am ""healthy"" after several years of struggling with purging/restricting, I still feel like I need to hide my body. All the scarring from stretch marks or cutting need to be hidden, No one can see my loose skin it is shameful and embarrassing. I just tend to think of how I would be viewed objectively. No one would look at me walking down the street and think I was someone who lost the weight of an entire person, they would just see me as some blob monster. 

The constant comparison of self to others is exhausting and often leaves me wondering if I will ever be happy with myself. Probably not. How do we untrain these trained behaviors?

If not for the judgement-free, loving support I receive from my partner, I would have probably honestly killed myself a long time ago. 

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences and thanks for possibly reading mine haha"
AnorexiaNervosa,f5zgkxh,t3_dpwecu,1572576461.0,"Listen, I can tell your heart is in the right place..my bf has to constantly hear about me having panic attacks because I hate my body. He tells me so often how I'm beautiful or sexy or whatever word he wants to use. I feel bad for him because it literally makes no difference to my opinion of myself. So I'm explaining this to you in hopes you understand the other side. 

Avoid activities that include food or revolve around food. Social eating is a trigger and probably makes your partner feel insecure about looking ""fat"" or eating ""too much"" infront of others. Also when they express these emotions to you, validate that your partners feelings are really how they're feeling, but remind them that they are beautiful as well. This way will touch them more hopefully, if you can express that you feel empathy for what they are going through. Trust me, if your partner could just ignore the obsessive thoughts that make them hate themselves, they most definitely would. It's compulsive. 

I often apologize for my feelings. But I always think I wish that I was heard. I feel like I don't trust outside opinions on my appearance because no one understands how much importance there is to you outward appearance. It's something that is so deep. People treat you better when you are ""beautiful"". These are just some of the thoughts that go through the mind. It's deep rumination. I hope you don't take it personally doesn't necessarily mean you're doing anything wrong but your partner is just hurting and wants some relief or escape from that dark place. 

I hope my stupid ramble helped."
AnorexiaNervosa,f5zfl8m,t3_dpq0e6,1572575688.0,"I actually don't eat at work either. I'll often get remarks like ""but doesn't the smell of my lunch make you hungry?"" I'm not a fucking Frankenstein I just feel worthless and this is how I'm coping, thanks. I've grown to accept that this is ""weird"" and I also make it clear that I don't care what anyone thinks."

90DayFiance,f5oc3dz,t3_doj2xe,1572314546.0,No they are not married. There is no formality with these ceremonies and are not legally binding.
AnorexiaNervosa,f0w127n,t3_d6vcus,1568996537.0,Same. I took some body checks today and all I can see is my round fat stomach and ogre hunch back shoulders. It's been driving me nuts but I can't stop eating.
AnorexiaNervosa,ezw545w,t3_d2olvo,1568208151.0,I know! I feel like such a failure. I've gained 25 lbs in the last year and I hate it. I always tell my bf how I'm fat and I miss feeling my bones. But I am also a gluttonous pig who can't stop eating.

AnorexiaNervosa,ep63860,t3_btwtoe,1559064069.0,"I feel your sentiments. I was formerly obese and now that I'm ""skinny"" I hate it when people around me are telling me it's ok to eat things because no one sees me as fat or whatever I think I look like. But it doesn't matter. I understand what it's like to be that person that you judge like that for being too big I'd rather be judged harshly for being too skinny. If that makes sense. Because I know people will look at me and judge me based purely on my size is probably a pretty heavy thought that weighs on my mind."
