AskReddit,f6ghdys,t3_dr1pwq,1572826063.0,At around 11 years old I started to buy stuff off the internet for my family. When I saw something I wanted I would ask my mum then use the card with her permission. Eventually I started to buy stuff without telling her too (i would ask her if I can buy something then buy 2 things instead). These would be silly thing like 99c games on the app store but at the time that was big. Eventually my mum spilled she knew (I had no idea the bank thing sent a msg everytime the card was used) and was mad cause i spent like 10 dollars (at 11 years old 10 was a lot) and was really mad at me for breaching her trust. I was ashamed of stealing and I never did anything of the sort ever again.

TooAfraidToAsk,f5w99vg,t3_dpefbz,1572517970.0,"The thing is, even if the person doesnt wear lipstick/makeup/dress etc. its also difficult to decide which gender to refer to them as. I have a friend who on first glance you'd think she was a he. When you see her from behind you will definitely think she's a he but she isn't. She identifies with she yet dresses up in stereotypically male clothing (she claims for comfort idk and if she's good with that it's not my business) but some people see a female face so they say she, some people see male clothing so they say he. She understands that people can't read her mind and simply, and politely corrects them when necessary. Your friend should just understand the difference when one does something from malice or otherwise and be understanding of others as he expects them to be understanding of him.

Edit : I forgot to mention that you might want to also see it from his perspective. His anger/annoyance might stem from his insecurities throughout a childhood of being seen to his assigned gender and simply just really wants everyone to understand rather than his reality. Meaning he might be angry at the situation and not the people."

unpopularopinion,f2tyycd,t3_de605z,1570403145.0,"While I do agree on it as a whole I also understand why it's not so. A judicial system is a complex thing and while a girl/guy (because guys could also be victims of rape) caught lying should be punished and the older person should be dealt with in a much less severe way and not be cinsidered a sex offender, it is very hard to establish if it is true or not. Also you basically can't decide yourself if a victim is lying unless they outright admits it or there is evidence they lied. 

Most times there isn't and even when there is there can also be other scenario's (such as noticing after the conversation took place) that they are still sex offenders. It's a very tricky situation to which unfortunately there are a lot more guilty parties than not guilty parties and so the change in law can't truly be justified unless done so very carefully (if possible at all)"
