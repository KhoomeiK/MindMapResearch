The combination of having a shitty supervisor, shitty company and so on was mentally and physically killing me. I woke up everday being extremely anxious, stressed and tired. Me and my family thought itâ€™s not worth going insane for just a paper so i decided to quit for my own sake.. seeing my friends fraduate will hurt ( i want them to graduate tho) , but i shouldnâ€™t compare my life to others. Itâ€™s all about recovering the damage for now.. sorry for my long response.."

Im gonna take a year to find myself again and try to enjoy life again like i always used to, and then hopefully get that degree. I think it was the right move, but still need to get used to it.."
