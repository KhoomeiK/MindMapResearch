You don't often get grants or things because you're native and white. They don't expect you to be poor. So it really just depends I'd say.

I have exclusively used AMD for 15 years. I have never had an issue like what /u/Correct_Truth is describing. I have used many different emulators, played a lot of games AAA and indie both. So I think you'd be alright. I used to use nvidia as well and in the last 3 years I switched to an AMG GPU as well. I have not had any issues. 

I have used N64, DS, GameCube, Wii, PS1, PS2, and PS3 emulators without a hitch. All experiences were both on older Athlon/Phenom chips and newer Ryzen chips. 

I also play old games as well as new ones regularly.

So there is my experience on the matter. If there's anything specific you'd like me to test I can. Just send me a DM :)"

It's a shame Wildlands has shitty AI that always knows where you are, otherwise I might favor it more.

But imo the AI and the stealth in Breakpoint is actually quite good. I hope to see more of it in the future and wish to see it developed upon more."

It's also the hardest of the original trilogy imo... they gave Jill less health than other characters and the boss fights were insanely difficult. I never struggled harder than with 3, so I'm just going to have to disagree. They may have used *some* elements from RE3, but that isn't the reason RE4 is a shit show. It's terrible because it plays nothing like and RE game, isn't scary, and has some of the dumbest plot in a video game. Not that plot matters much in RE but come on. Straight up joke of a game in all ways."
