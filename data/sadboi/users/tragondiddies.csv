AskReddit,fhwx6l0,t3_f52jim,1581934874.0,"My auntie is called Karen and she's the kindest, most generous women you could ever meet.

She's taken me on a few holidays and I didn't have to pay for anything, she even gave me spending money. She's helped my parents with their money struggles and gives a lot to charities.

She cares a lot about our family and we don't know what we would do without her."

No one got hurt but they had to break down the door and she was arrested.

Oh and then there was the year someone smeared shit all over the bathroom wall."
Anxiety,fcx55px,t3_ej29di,1578051661.0,I've just started my first full-time job after leaving uni and this is exactly what worries me. I haven't had any time to do any of my hobbies cause my weekends are the only time I get to see my friends and boyfriend. Lucky I get quite a lot of paid holidays but I worry I'll have just given up by the time I get to use them. All I can do is try my best to stick to it I guess.
AskReddit,f929jaz,t3_e380ez,1575019306.0,"Overcoming social anxiety and making a bunch of new friends at university, starting a relationship with the love of my life and landing my first 'big boy' job. 

These are all pretty big steps considering the year before I was too scared to talk to most people at uni, I was stuck in an underpaid internship with a shit boss that was miles away from home and I didn't want to be alive."
