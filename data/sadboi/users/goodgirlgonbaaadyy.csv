depression,fev8vjo,t3_ee58qm,1579394492.0,"My mother is the exact same way but worse. I suggest moving out. Either your in high school, or not. Find a way to move out. I waited until I graduated to move out. I‚Äôm back home again for the last 2yrs working. It was the worse decision I ever made coming back. All my mother does is nag at you, call you down daily, she honestly wouldn‚Äôt care if you were sick in bed dying. You get my point. We fought a few times, where cops had to come in a few times. I live in a bad household, not to mention with a baby in the house too. So please try to get yourself out before it gets worse. I am so weak, mentally ill, sensitive, & depressed all the time because of this women."
