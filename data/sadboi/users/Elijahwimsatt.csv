NoFap,fclqjb4,t1_fckeewn,1577754031.0,"You gotta use meditation as a state where you are looking at your thoughts but not attaching yourself to them, you are aware of yourself, and you are aware of the thought as a separate thing in your mind. Try it with this in mind if you haven't, it's about watching your thoughts flow like a river and not letting it affect you. This could be really hard especially if it's with porn but if you're successful I guarantee it'll help"

depression,f459qmr,t1_f40nmkd,1571369752.0,"I feel like I've just dealt with bad anxiety my whole life. Like just in the moment having a serious lack of self confidence that looms over me. The kind of effect where youre thinking about the right thing to say after someone says something fucked up to you if you know what I mean. I feel like I know what to do in my head but when it really comes down to it I just can't prove to myself I have what it takes when it comes to lots of things. Talking to people, talking to girls, building relationships, doing well in school etc... And then it comes around in cycles. One day I'll feel sort of okay, and the next day I'm a mess."
Yugioh101,f3xeu51,t1_f3x6ail,1571237097.0,"I would agree with this guy, watch the pro play tour matches that they put on YouTube. Cimoooo does commentary for them. You'll find that a lot of people are just making really spicy variants of some really good decks out there right now. Pendelums are a really good choice right now. You can even get three Endymion structure decks that have a lot of value to them too. Good luck!"

Fuck the urges, come on here and read some inspirational shit, that's what I do, or start reading something or listen to Jordan Peterson lmao. Whatever you do you have to change your view of it from something that you are even allowed to do, it's just not something you do anymore. DONT identify with it. You're literally releasing energy that your body has to take the time to build back up again and it can never get used to having an actually good amount of testosterone and doesn't even know what to do with it. Give your body the chance to be what it's naturally supposed to be. You got this mane!"
IWantToLearn,f27sog5,t3_dceu62,1570045268.0,"Just smile a little more. I work at Yogurtland dude and can I tell you I fuckin HATE IT. But I still smile and what I find is that when I do have a good interaction with a customer it really does make the day better and it makes me feel better, no doubt it makes them feel better too. Just look for positive interactions because they really do help, regardless of how pointless or stupid they may seem. Takes the same amount of effort to chose not to say nice things as it does to actually say nice things. Instead of just waiting to take their order, when you ask them how they're doing, really listen to them and their tone when they say it and just be nice, it really goes a long way and people appreciate it."
IWantToLearn,f27lkeo,t3_dc7p3f,1570040931.0,"Gotta do something that involves your balance dude! I got ADHD too but the over focused type, which might be different than yours, but find something you like to do that's a bit physical that maybe has recreational meet ups around you if possible. If you do this it'll be intimidating at first, I've been there, but its worth it bc people are usually nice to beginners in things and are actually just happy to see people joining. If you can't do that then buy a skateboard or something and take it slow. Don't start riding down hills right away, learn to push. Just get out your comfort zone so you know you can do something beyond normal tasks with a certain amount of ease. You don't have to be a master but I guarantee starting a sport or something of the sort will totally help ya."

badminton,f20p6sh,t3_db46vs,1569862333.0,"I feel like this really just depends on how you smash. There are certain ways you could hold your racket that help you with deceptive shots but really that doesn't matter as much until you actually swing for the shot. However, making sure to train yourself to hold the racket neutral to the court every time will help stop your opponent from reading what kind of shot you'll make because you can go for a jump smash to deceive them and actually play a drop shot or clear to the end of the court. :)"
