I recently started watching Family Vacation after missing a huge chunk of the show and I was floored with how much she’d changed, even with alcohol. 

She so whiny and demanding. Not a good combination. I know she’s adopted and I for some reason feel like her adopted family had money. She’s probably never been told no, struggled, etc etc leading to her personality. Her adopted parents probably over compensated by spoiling her, and definitely rotten."

Or you mom could have zero to do with it and your brain just picked her body.
