I’ve been afraid to tell people about my regression as well, especially people who may feel inclined to take care of me because I don’t want anyone to be obliged to do so. 

I think the most important thing is to trust the person you open up to about it. Another thing is to get therapy, whether it be about the regression or not. I dropped my therapy for 3 months and my regression got a lot more “impure” and scary. My friend sat me down and asked me to please please please talk to someone again, because he witnessed me totally regressed which scared the hell out of him (usually my friends only see my regression when I’m happy/playful).

ageregression,fojik4z,t3_g7t2ny,1587821865.0,"Hi Aly, welcome to the subreddit. I’m 22F and I’ve been regressing since before I was a teenager due to childhood trauma and mental health issues (bipolar and borderline personality disorder). I regress involuntarily, sometimes it’s on the good side of emotions (happy, giggly, cuddly, excitable), and other times it’s on the bad side of emotions (crying a lot, hiding away, fearing abandonment). I can’t control when it happens or how I’ll react, but it usually comes about when I’ve had a bad day. 

I have a caregiver that has the title of Mama (my fiancée). I also have two “big brothers” who are kind and loving and exactly like brothers, and they also take care of me when I’m super duper regressed.

I don’t openly chat about my regression in regular conversation but I’m not scared to bring it up to my “family” if I need to. They all understand why I regress and weren’t weirded out at all. They had already been making fun of me (for lack of a better word/phrase) for having a naturally childlike personality and appearance for aaaages anyway. 

I’m glad you found us and are opening up about regressing! Lots of people have shame in it but when we talk about it with each other, we’re breaking the stigma (for ourselves, if not for everyone!) 

If there’s any questions you want answered, you can reply or send me a message!"
