RoleReversal,fpintfy,t1_fpi27yx,1588644805.0,"You are right, women have on average more muscular endurance than men.

Women generally use proportionately more fat and less carbohydrate at a given intensity of exercise than men do.

Anything that preserves muscle  glycogen (the major carbohydrate storage form in animals) helps you sustain exercise longer, so using fat more than carbohydrate for energy means that a muscle will be less powerful but it won't run out of energy as quickly.

So for the same exercise,men are faster and more powerful at first, but became more exhausted much faster than women.

However you still have a gap between men and women in endurance sports.

Endurance sports use the aerobic system  which relies on a continual intake of oxygen. During aerobic exercise, the body burns fat and glycogen for fuel.

Men have on average genetically have a higher VO2 max (a measure of aerobic capacity), a bigger heart and more blood than women.

they also have a on average higher hematocrit  & hemoglobin which cause more O2 delivery to working muscle per blood volume.

Men muscles are more efficient in storing and using glycogen, a carbohydrate that is the main fuel used for speed in distance events.

Also the extra fat in women is still a performance penalty for women compare to men leaner muscle mass.

That explain why even if women are better at conserving energy, men have a bigger and better-fueled engin which allows them to be faster even in endurance sports.

You need a very veeeeeery long distance or ultra endurance sports for the gap between gender to blur a bit.

Like in ultra-running, which includes races longer than a marathon, is one of the few sports where women and man athletes regularly compete together, and in which women athletes sometimes win."

i too had problem with dry skin and open wound but hand solution are not possible in my case because it feels really really bad on my skin and i just end up needing to wash my hands even more, so i had to find another solution for this. 

that solution was putting on gloves whenever i felt like the hand washing is going to  excessive and damaging for my hand (like washing my hand before dinner is okay but if i feel like i'm going to need to wash them every five minutes i will put my gloves on). 

So, the gloves act like some sort of barrier between my hand and the world and unlike my hand, i can wash them has many time has i want and replace them if i end up destroying them in the process. bonus point, the contact also help me calm down a bit..

so even if some people will give me funny look for always having gloves on, i don't care.

I wish you luck and hope you will find a solution that works for you."

WhiteWolfRPG,fg40dkh,t3_ewrpa0,1580493510.0,"well if we take wikipedia definition of a psychopath it something like this:

**Psychopathy** is traditionally a [personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder) characterized by persistent [antisocial behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour), impaired [empathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy) and [remorse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remorse), and [bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boldness), [disinhibited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinhibition), and [egotistical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egotism) [traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior).

psychopathy is associated with a  lack of [socialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization) and responsibility, [impulsivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulsivity), sensation-seeking (in some cases), and aggression (in some cases).

So i don't see anything that indicate psychopath don't feel emotion,to me, its more like they don't care about your well being and will only consider your worth by how much you can offer them, which would be a very toreador, or even vampire at large, typical behavior."

but just seeing this picture can make people angry by reminding them of unpleasant encounter, and in a friendly and safe subreddit that is the lgbt+ reddit, they probably don't want to see this particularly emotionally charged picture, who have the potential to ruin their day, here.

egg_irl,fdf9shs,t3_ekxs2v,1578356641.0,"i absolutely agree with what you just say.

\[also before you read the rest of my post i'm going to assume during all my hypothetical scenarios that everyone has the best of intention and are very polite, which is in reality not the case but for the sake of my point we will momentarily live in a utopia.\]

back to my essay

However i will point the fact that this is a sub made for trans people in denial which mean that the major focus of this sub is helping other trans people coming to terms with who their are and accepting themself.

Which mean, in more practical term, that if you get a ""cis people don't do X, you are trans"" comment, i think its safe to assume that the comment isn't gatekeeping clothing or gender role but rather trying to be helpful with your assumed confusion, since again the premise of this sub is trans people  in denial.

Also it raise the question on how to tell apart between an egg and just a cis ally on this sub.

by telling you are cis? a lot of people on this place think their are cis but then actually find out their are not.so, base on how you word you sentence, it can be difficult to differentiate between a cis^(tm)   and a cis ally and  it's very easy to get caught in the heat of the moment and understand that you are just in denial and need a friendly push to make you realise who you are, even if it's not actually the case.

Td:LR not everyone is trans or questioning in egg irl, however it's a meme sub made to help others crack their shell, so absolutely not a place for calm and in debt  reflection  on gender; gender role and how do you want to present and what is your gender identity.

So i don't recommend this place if you are questioning and need to calmly discover who you are, or if you want anything else then: ""Skirts/dress are cute af, still cis tho""

That being said i'm sorry that you feel disrespect."

feemagers,f9b8ekb,t1_f9b36lf,1575210226.0,"I think that the fact that the wife part can be weird or not mostly depends on the situation and your relationship with your friend.

Like if it's a total stranger or a casual friend that would definitely be weird, but if you have a history of casual flirt with your friend and that both of you are ok with it, i personally don't see a problem.

Because in that case, your not using the term wife in is academic sense of two individual married to each other but more like a playful word without too much meaning behind it.

Any other word could have been used (like gorgeous,...) and you right that an another choice of word would have help avoid confusion or double sense while still keeping the meaning you want in your sentence, but this meme seams to refer to a not so serious context between people who know each other, so again, i don't think it matters a lot that you are using the perfect word for it or not.

That or the girlfriend is actual trying to subtly imply that she want to get married, but again, unless you have the context behind it, it's difficult to know which one is which, and memes tend to not be very serious., so idk  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

However the thing that got me confuse and that i was asking a explanation for in you comment, and please tell me if i got it wrong,  is that your were saying that, regardless of background, it's okay for her gf to say wife but not her bf and i honestly needed further explanation to understand that point of view.

You can literally change two things about vaggie, her name and the fact that she is latina, and boom, your problematic character isn't problematic anymore.
She still deserve to be in hell but no longer reinforce the same over used trope of latina= short temper.


I choose vaggie as an example but lets take angel dust .


He is a porn star. okay. 
Then why making him the main comic relief? If all his personality is base around being gay and a porn star, choosing him as the comic relief can only end poorly. 
But the creator still choose to do it and that way consolidated that old stereotype of gay people= feminine sluts


Again, you could have literally swap angel for anybody else and keep him for later but nope, we have only 30 min to show people what we can do, lets make the only knowed gay male character a slut! I'm sure that won't end poorly.

I wouldn't care about the gay jokes if they were other jokes, but the creator specifically choose to highlight the fact that ""ostracizing gay people in hell is so much fun""!

Spoiler it isn't and it's getting redundant very quickly. 
Especially if it's is your main source of humor along sides racism is... sex and drugs.

or

having a latina wlw character named vaggie as vagina and she haves an explosive temper.

having a drug addict  gay man, named angel dust, constantly making dirty jokes. Constantly. I really wish they were more to him then that, but from all his screen time, he rarely show other aspect of him then the ""slutty, omg i love drugs"" side of is personality.

I like the artistic direction and the premises have potential but the show could have been 1000x time better without all the tasteless jokes made at gay people expense or the constant use of already over used stereotypes.

I mean it's better to go tell her,maybe getting reject and then carrying on your friendship with them, then being awkward around them for an indefinite amount of time because you too scared to tell them about your crush and then someone else date them and you end up felling like a idiot for waiting so long to confess."

aaaaaaacccccccce,f3xd4mu,t1_f3wf8lk,1571236265.0,"well the thing is is that communication is super important in a relationship, and there is a limit on how much guessing you can do.

Your partner can not just tell you nothing about their boundaries and needs and then lash out at you and drop that ""i will leave you if you do X ever again"" line . How are you suppose to know that they don't like X if they don't tell you in the first place?

You care about them a lot and the fact that you don't know what is acceptable for them is bringing you a lot of stress.

So i think you two need to find a way to figure out what is comfortable for them without making you uncomfortable and stress out.

Also judging from your post it seems that they are  against you doing anything sexual near them, so maybe you can keep all you porn stuff and use them while you partner isn't there, like when they are at work or hanging out with friends."

feemagers,f3x02fe,t3_din2co,1571228244.0,"are your posting because you feel insecure an need validation?

I use to have problem with how feel with my body.I also understand the need for validation and wanted to feel attractive.

 but do you need some complete strangers opinions of your body for that? 

Because lets say you have your what you want, then what? sure it will make you feel good for some minutes, maybe even hours but the insecurity will still be there. and when you determine your value based on what other people think of you, that is literally the exact opposite of self-esteem and self-worth.

I think it's better if you try to love you body first and find a way to feel good about yourself that doesn't stem from other people's opinions and validation , i don't recommend posting nudes of you for validation, it can be really slippery and all the downs sides are not worst it.

Also if you do post that nude, please make sure that you are not  recognizable , like wearing a cute mask or something."

shadowrunreturns,f3bfew1,t3_dgd3rt,1570808999.0,"In today's episode of different peoples different taste: i prefer hk atmosphere and team member over dragonfall.

Both writing are equal but different at the same time. Dragonfall as a ""moral conundrums that you were unsure about even  after finishing it""  feeling to it while  hong kong is more unlikely ""hero"" defeats the imbalance in Chi and restores balance to the worlds.

As for the team members, in dragonfall you can feel even from the start that you are the leader, the character are too passive and  centered around the player while in HK it feels like you're part of one big dysfunctional family and while the team members appreciate you, it's as an equal, not some sort of god send creature here to resolve all of their problem.

But both have in depth team member with more then one trait to them.

As for the mission, in dragonfall most of them are about hitting corporations and laboratories of several  kinds and more action oriented then hk, which as more diversity in the type of mission it offers and type of place to go with different atmosphere and i definitely remember being a high charisma characters is way more useful in hk.

Also hk can feel like walls of text being thrown at you sometimes so i don't recommend doing it in a one shot but there is also a non negligible gameplay improvement.

In the end, I find myself doing several playtrough of hk while it was difficult for me to even finish dragonfall, so it's really just a matter of taste.

I hope you will have a good time no matter what game you will choose to play, if not both."
