About you, stay strong, you deserve better than this. Always remember she's the one to live in vain, not you. I hope you could get over it."

I found the titles of the songs quite interesting so I checked it out Not gonna lie, that kind of music changed my life forever!!!"

When I come to class, I saw them were happy and it made me feel like everyone were talking crap behind my back and making joke about me. I’m not saying the psychopaths who shoot up the schools were right, but somehow I could understand a bit, when you’re so depressed, frustrated but everyone around you are happy, that feeling really sucks. It drives you crazy."

Sometimes I wanted to suicide but then I thought there’s so many things I haven’t enjoyed enough like playing game, listening to music so it’s not right time to go. So even there’s a little thing you could enjoy or you feel really matters to you then let’s think carefully about it."
