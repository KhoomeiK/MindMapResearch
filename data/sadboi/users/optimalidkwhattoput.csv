You see, theres three types of opinions - ones that are just opinions, and ones that are proven by fact, and ones that have been disproved by fact, are wrong and should be corrected.

I'll let you guess which one is yours.

Listen, let me tell you a story:

One day I just said ""screw it"". I ate 3 red spicy bags of doritos, and later lost all emotion. My stomach felt weird and I literally didnt want to eat or drink anything for 4 hours.

Next, I had a really bad bathroom break. I was in there for 20 minutes, and pooping it all out was the spiciest thing ever. It hurt badly, and the thing repeated at night, when it ESPECIALLY hurt.

I would rather go to the sewer, find that specific poop, shove half up my ass, eat the other half and smear what's left on my hand around my cock and balls rather than literally just listen to you speak.

Your opinion isnt an opinion, it is a belief was would've been valid 10 years ago but has been disproved long ago, because it isnt 2010, or 2015 either.

Linux has skyrocketed in market share and that just adds to amount of community effort to make Linux the best OS possible.

People like you are the reason Micro$oft get away with so much data collection, forced updates and other kinds of bullshit and Apple is allowed to lock iOS down so much so that it is literally considered an embedded system.

You, a single human - your opinion wont affect the world in the long run. But when many people have the same opinion as you and you spread this wrong, disproved opinion - then it becomes a problem. You spread misinformation quite literally and minimally, but STILL affect a small part of the world in the long run.

YOU are the entitled manchild that thinks all his opinions are facts and otherwise is a problem and is always wrong. It's because your caveman brain hates change, but you have to just accept and admit it.

TL;DR: Splish, facts, your opinion is a literal hot steaming pile of trash. Maybe you could try using facts and reasonable reasons next time you comment something, like me."

OR, it could be a driver issue. If you're on Windows, open Device Manager, go to the properties of your Wi-Fi card, go to the Driver tab and click ""Rollback Driver"". If the button is grayed out or this doesn't work, click ""Update Driver"" instead.

On macOS, honestly I don't know what you can do at this point since OSX is so locked down.

On Linux, find the distro you're on. Do a Google search on how to figure that out. Once you know what distro you're on, execute your distro-specific command:

* Debian-based (Ubuntu, Pop\_OS!, Mint, etc.)
   * sudo apt update
   * sudo apt upgrade
* Arch-based (Sabayon, etc.)
   * pacman -Syu
* Manjaro-based
