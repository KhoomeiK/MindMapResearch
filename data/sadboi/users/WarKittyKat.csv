You get 1/2 of your DNA from each parent, but that half isn't going to consist of even proportions from the grandparents in question.

From my limited searching, grandparent tests usually ask for DNA from the mother and both paternal grandparents (since it's typically paternity in question).  If you don't have the mother involved it gets less reliable.

Worst case scenario is all 3 grandparents have DNA on file.

Like it wasn't the presence or absence of a diagnosis that was my problem.  It was the approach that therapists and society took that I was someone with a problem that needed to be treated.  In my case this was also combined with a failure to recognize that my mother was abusive, I think largely due to a lack of understanding of female abusers.

And I think it's situations like that that I'm especially concerned about.  It's not that the specific diagnosis was the problem.  It's the overall view that *I* was the one with the mental illness that needed fixing.  And the way that framing sort of ruled out the idea that, hey, maybe it's actually common beliefs about mothers and general heterosexist issues that are the problem here.  Like, by positioning me as the one to be fixed, it made it impossible to acknowledge that maybe I had a point that didn't fit with what most people would consider reasonable or acceptable.  It's not just that I couldn't get help without a diagnosis, but that the fact of being defined as a person with mental illness meant a lack of interest in exploring external factors and a treatment that my perception of them was unreliable and not worth considering.

I think we have an overall problem (at least in the US) that we don't, as a society, want to acknowledge the possibility of stress or trauma being a normal reaction outside of certain very narrow limits.  So the effects of things like poverty, discrimination, and so forth are still seen as largely an individual problem.  So it a lot of abuse that doesn't fit within certain fairly narrow categories that match how we expect an abuser and victim to look and act.

And we're far more inclined to treat mental illness as the baseline cause, and presume that fixing the mental illness will fix homelessness, than to consider that the stress of being homeless might be the cause of people's problems.

Some of my perspective is coming from a long history of being diagnosed and treated for, essentially, not being able to put up with an abusive mother without being stressed out.  And I think that's a clear case for me of where the model of mental illness as an illness - i.e. something wrong with you, the patient - did a lot of damage.  It really kept the focus on me and what was wrong with me that I was feeling so much distress in a way that actually *reinforced* the idea that I was at fault for the abuse.

And I'm questioning if stuff like that is happening here too.  Where we're actually reinforcing the idea that there is something broken about you for experiencing severe distress, or that a person ought to be able to push through whatever without being significantly affected.

MensLib,fqmjycq,t1_fqm3nwj,1589478683.0,"From what I've read and familiarity with other research, I think there's a larger question here as to whether ""mental illness"" is really a good framing of intense psychological distress.  A lot of the push to see things as mental *illness* seems to be coming less from established research and more from various social considerations.  One is that in many places, working with insurance requires fitting mental health care into a medical model - one where you diagnose a disease and treat the patient until the disease is gone.  Another is the general western tendency towards individualism and the correlated disregard of social impact.  A third is that psychology is still very much based on a white, middle class, heterosexual view of how the world works, and that often doesn't account for things like poverty or discrimination very well.

Also, even though done with good intentions, a lot of the push to equate mental illness with physical illness has been done more because of the belief that it will encourage help seeking rather than because we've definitely scientifically established that.  Ironically a lot more recent studies are showing that equating mental illness with physical illness actually does very little to reduce stigma.  It often shifts the perspective from the idea that people are blameworthy to the idea that they're somehow just constitutionally inferior.

So the question from my perspective isn't so much ""would so many people kill themselves while perfectly mentally healthy"" as ""can we actually divide people into those who are mentally healthy and those with a mental disease."""

I think the ""learning to cope"" idea is good to a point, but at the same time it's got a lot of weaknesses.  And I think a lot of those weaknesses are coming from the fact that psychology has largely been based on studies of those in privileged positions.  And it's being written by those who are typically in many ways privileged, especially on the economic front.

I say this in part as someone who was considered one of the therapy ""failures.""  And I eventually realized it was because therapy was really pushing me to internalize the blame for my distress.  That really hampered me being able to understand and learn to deal with an abusive family, because it was teaching me to see my distress as something wrong with *me* that needed to be fixed.  Sort of an implied ""well if I was just tough enough I could handle this"" type of approach that didn't really do anything other than make me feel guilty for not being able to make things better.

To use the example of losing your job, how well you can cope with that depends on a number of factors, not all of which are in your control.  I've found a lot of therapists approach job loss from the perspective of a middle class person with savings and a decent credit score.  It's very different if you're someone for whom job loss might mean potential homelessness, or not being able to afford needed medical care, or something like that.  And there's a point where I think our approach to mental health has kind of just assumed that if we fix the mental health stuff then everyone will be able to achieve a stable life.

(Disclaimer: I'm XX nonbinary, so my experiences are somewhat different.  At the same time I think there are a lot of significant parallels, especially given that part of my abuse background had the issue that it's hard to get abuse recognized outside of the traditional male perp/female victim standard.

For some people therapy seems to only hurt and when they leave therapy resolve their issues on their on own. Good therapists should look for this very situation and know they are not helping and for the client's sake end the therapy. I think you had bad therapists because they did not see they were hurting you.

Unfortunately I think it's a less uncommon experience than people are aware of.  Which is part of why I talk about it.

Part of the trouble though is that ending therapy might not be a good option either, at least if you can't offer anything else.  Or rather, it's only really a viable option if you're dealing with a client who is pretty much managing already.  For someone where I was, who was basically unable to hold down a job due to mental health symptoms - it was only at all viable for me to quit because I had somewhere safe to stay without paying rent or being expected to be in treatment.  And that's not going to be the norm.  The norm is going to be that you have to either be in therapy or lose access to any help you might need with making sure you have your basic physical needs met.  (And prior to that I have actually had at least one time where I stayed with therapy I knew was hurting me because the alternative was losing access to safe housing for not making enough progress in treatment.)

I think for me, therapy that was willing to consider a traumagenic model instead of a purely biomedical one outside of the classic PTSD presentation, as well as having the open-mindedness to understand abuse outside of the standard gendered paradigms, could have really helped.  But the vast majority of therapists aren't able to make shifts like that, and we don't really have any good way of escalating cases where people need to be matched up to a therapist with particular skills.  We can barely manage consistent diagnoses, and it's unclear to what extent the DSM is actually giving us much more information than vague symptom clusters.  But we're also not comfortable helping people unless we can prove they're doing all the right steps to be getting better, even if we don't *have* any useful steps to point them to.

What I experienced is not in the same realm as ""not clicking"" with a therapist.  It's the experience of having therapists that you felt like you clicked with and could trust and then having them inflict an intensely hurtful experience on you.  ""Not clicking"" doesn't leave you with massive flashbacks to therapy, or waking up in the middle of the night shaking and crying because you had a dream about therapy.  What you're telling people like me is basically keep repeating something that has been massively traumatic and live-altering in a significant negative way, because the outcome might be wonderful this time.  And it's trivializing to have our experiences repeatedly reduced to just not fitting or not having a great therapist.  (Note that this wasn't from unethical therapists either; this was from relatively standard treatment.)

I know you mean to be encouraging.  But please understand this is not helpful.  This is communicating to people that our experience of significant and lasting harm from therapy isn't valid, by reframing it in terms of things like bad fit or just not clicking.  And it's been a major, major issue for me trying to deal with ongoing trauma issues while living in a society that sees therapy as the only valid solution and never a possible part of the problem.

The last therapist I worked with, I really thought I could trust her.  In hindsight, I feel more like I was tricked into accepting her framing of my issues, so that I couldn't see the problems.  I was accepting her encouragement to push through my anxiety and keep working harder as the path to get better, and those aspects were reframing any discomfort I felt as inevitable results of my diagnosis.  The sessions ended when she pushed me into a dissociative episode so bad I couldn't figure out how to cross the street safely in the aftermath - and then left a voicemail message saying she didn't understand why I'd quit because we'd been making great progress, as evidenced by the fact that I'd seemed a bit defensive in that session.

Mine wasn't involving involuntary holds so much as a general failure to recognize a parent committing medical child abuse, along with a general expectation that a woman couldn't be predatory towards her daughter.  I won't deny that a lot of that time I legitimately needed help.  What I will say is that while I got treatment, basically none of what I got from the mental health system actually constituted *help*.  What I ended up getting was a new set of major trauma triggers that I couldn't get help with because no one would acknowledge them enough to even consider working with me.

But I've found that the reaction from most professionals is ""that can't possibly happen.""  The possibility isn't covered in training - although dealing with concepts like resistance or non-compliance, which is what I was viewed as, is.  As far as any actual studies or the view of therapists, I'm a client who mysteriously quit treatment that was definitely helping.  In fact I've had multiple times where I quit extremely harmful and in retrospect completely incorrect treatment, only to have the therapist express shock that I would quit when therapy was going so well.

For a lot of us, our experience is that the system is set up to insist that it's helping, and that if we think it's not then that's our problem for being too mentally ill to understand that we're being helped.

I was only able to make any progress on digging myself out of mental health issues once I got away from all the confusion that therapy was pushing on me, and all the pressure to accept that it was just something chemically wrong with me.

Once I quit therapy for good, I was able to start acknowledging and understanding the abuse I'd endured as a kid and how I'd learned a lot of expectations of what adulthood should look like and how to cope that weren't healthy.  But therapy was really preventing me from accepting the abuse by pushing the biochemical theory as an explanation.

I also heavily suspect some of the specific nature of my abuse may have played in.  I can't prove it, but I strongly suspect if I'd been abused by my father I would have gotten a much different response.  My own experience is of a predatory and dominating mother with a largely passive father who was clearly afraid of her.  But I have also often gotten the sense that most therapists operate off of an assumption that men are predators and women are victims.  And it can be kind of built in on a level where even someone who consciously agrees that women can be predators might not see it as easily.

For example, someone might acknowledge that women can be predators, but see a woman insisting on viewing a child undressing as simply a bit intrusive, while a man doing the same thing would be considered sexually predatory.  The bar seems to be much higher, where women have to be much more actively violent or overtly sexual in order to be seen as predatory.  Plus it just wouldn't be asked about, like I might be asked if my father was ever violent to my mother but not vice versa.

But that's one aspect of what I'm looking at.  What I'm thinking is it doesn't seem to be just that they were shitty by randomness, but that maybe the specifics of certain cases seem to draw out shitty behavior?  I got the sense that my case was ""all wrong"", according to the working assumptions, even psychological training.  The abuse I went through doesn't show on trauma screenings.  I was put together and academically successful and I got the sense at times of being seen as too good for the problems I was having - like someone who could manage a tough grad school program but struggle to remember to brush their teeth just didn't compute.

I've gotten partial answers to why, but it doesn't seem to fully explain everything.  Like I feel like normal people in normal relationships could at least see these patterns, but there seems to be something about the therapy relationship that is making them not see them?"
mentalhealth,fpp98gn,t1_fpp2r4p,1588798145.0,"Some.  A lot of the trouble is that it's very hard to get them *out*.  The dynamic of the good mother who's so worried about her mentally ill child is so powerful, and mental health professionals are extremely ready and willing to buy into it.  In contrast, claiming that this apparently nearly perfect wife and mother martyr-figure is actually an abuser is easily seen as a sign of paranoia in someone who *obviously* has a long history of mental health problems.

It's almost a sense I've had of collusion, albeit unintentional.  My mother desperately wants to be a good mother with a sick child she can rescue, and the professionals were happy to see me as sick so they could fix me.  In both cases anything other than occupying the sick role and passively accepting whatever treatment was offered - no matter how much harm it was doing - was seen as bad behavior and a further sign of my own inability to make rational choices for myself.  With mental health care it also seemed self reinforcing; basically any distrust or failure to cooperate with the professionals was seen as irrational and proof of mental illness, no matter the reasons.

It's a good way for an abusive parent to extend control into adulthood, by using the systems of mental health to kind of force someone back into the childlike role of not being seen as capable of making clear judgments.  So then you can't be believed about the abuse because you're mentally ill.  And it's ok to force things on you against your will so long as the stated aim is to help fix your mental illness that is preventing you from seeing that you need it."
mentalhealth,fpo1q2s,t1_fpn2g77,1588776792.0,"I mean in the sense of being untraceable.  Think of it like dealing with a stalking situation, only instead of getting protection from the police you have to worry about potentially needing protection from the police.  Like part of the issue is the threat that if you don't keep an abuser happy they'll call and say you're going to commit suicide.  And there's no legal way to stop it because the law doesn't recognize that as a threat."
mentalhealth,fplt9ws,t1_fpiz3ga,1588719044.0,"All of this was when I was over 18.  Including one incident of being basically forced to return to an abusive home as an adult under threat of being locked up as a suicide risk (which I was not).

I don't think it's as impersonal as in your analogy.  While they may not have intended to harm me, we are still talking about people who were interacting in some sort of relationship with me and deliberately choosing to do these things to me after talking to me because they had come to certain specific conclusions about me.  I wasn't just another faceless entity.

It feels to me much more like, say, how certain guys would get really really aggressive if I say I'm not looking to date.  Where somehow it's both personal and impersonal, because they have a slot in their minds for how women should work and I am failing to fill that slot.  And by failing to fit into their expectations I am in some way personally attacking them and that can't be tolerated.


I picked the word ""drive"" deliberately.  Not that I think it was necessarily one they were overtly aware of.  But that there seemed to nonetheless be some sort of underlying pattern of beliefs and motivations that was in some way creating this behavior.  Like there was some sort of systemic need to ensure that I, the mental patient, stayed within the boundaries they'd set up, regardless of whether those boundaries were actually benefiting anyone.  I often got the sense that anything short of my working with the system and getting the expected results was in some way threatening.  A lot of it felt like the same attitude certain adults have with kids, where they act like if you try to reason or engage with a child it'll result in utter chaos.

And I have to wonder if there isn't an aspect of simple abuse denial in all this.  I posted in r/CPTSD too, and this seems to not be an uncommon experience among victims of childhood abuse.  Psychology has a nasty history of labeling abuse victims as crazy ever since Freud invented the oedipus complex.  I have wondered if some of this isn't so much...it's easier on us to think that a young adult just has some sort of chemical imbalance, than that an apparently model mother was engaging in abuse and we never even thought to look.

The concern I have is in part that, given that this all happened when I was over 18, there's no real possible way to *get* a healthy environment.  I'd have to find some way to effectively disappear completely, which is almost impossible in today's world.  And no matter the stability it's extremely difficult to be taken seriously within a setup that's designed to label you as not credible."
mentalhealth,fpi56k6,t1_fphuy9w,1588633880.0,"I do not have a current therapist and have not for years.  I've only been able to make progress when outside of therapy.  I actually really trusted several of the prior ones, which is how they were able to do so much damage to me.  It wouldn't have happened if I hadn't trusted them.  Every time I trusted them they set me back so far, and I could only make progress when I was away from their system.  I don't think I need to be away from CBT; I think I need to be away from the entire DSM model of treatment.  I think the baseline problem in cases like mine is the idea of my having a disease that needs to be treated or a sickness to be cured, just like you would give someone an infection for an antibiotic.  I don't think you can really listen to a person who's saying things that don't sound right to you if you're viewing them as someone who's just ill and can't see what's going on, while viewing yourself as the one who's healthy and able to do things correctly.

I don't think it was even trying to bandaid a wound.  It was just plain gaslighting me into thinking that my not being able to put up with abuse was a problem with me.  We're talking more along the lines of growing up with a parent with munchausen's or something similar, or a sexually abusive parent, and then having therapists try to convince you it didn't happen because it doesn't sound like what they think childhood trauma should sound like.  Like despite showing a lot of signs of what I later learned fit the definition of medical child abuse almost perfectly, I'd be told that it was impossible for something to be abuse so long as it was medical care and a doctor was involved.  Similar stuff, there was a lot of sort of quasi-sexual stuff as a kid but no one really paid much attention because it was my mother.

I've seen at this point over 20 professionals who all swore up and down they couldn't find any signs of trauma.  Honestly that mostly seems to mean that they couldn't find any signs of the sorts of traumas they were looking for, and then didn't believe me when I tried to speak up about the ones I did.  They just seemed so intent on fixing the ""paranoia"", and then if I acted like I thought maybe their view or the treatment was the problem that was more sign of my paranoia.

At this point I have seen over 20+ professionals who all said I was just mysteriously paranoid and had no signs of trauma.  I have zero interest in ever talking to one again.  But I'm trying to figure out why they had such a drive to rip apart people like me for not having enough of our shit sorted out before coming in to therapy, and how we can stop that from happening to others in the future.

Especially because with an abusive family around I am still continually at risk of being locked up just because she is more convincing than I am and can call in suicide reports, and as long as our current system allows and validates these sorts of things people like me will be vulnerable to continued abuse."

That's kind of what I'm trying to get more information on?  Like it seems simultaneously true that I'm seeing a significant number of therapists do these sorts of things, AND that there is absolutely nothing I can possibly find that I could have done differently to prevent that.  Like take the last point, I'm seeing cases where I'm repeatedly pushing myself to my limit or even past it, trying as hard as I can, and telling therapists this, and then *still* being repeatedly told that therapy isn't working because I'm not putting any effort in.  I don't see anything different I could do about that?  Like I could even in therapy recognize that there was a problem, and for some reason I could be trying to do the things the therapist asked and it wouldn't be producing the results they wanted - but actually saying that across a half-a-dozen different therapists would be very consistently treated like I was just deciding not to cooperate and they would consistently insist that if I was actually trying I would be getting the results I was definitely not getting.

The whole thing just seemed like therapy was only for people with certain issues.  Like I was diagnosed with MDD or GAD, they set out on a treatment plan for those, and I had better either get with the treatment plan or get out.  And getting with the treatment plan meant not having any symptoms or struggles that didn't fit with the diagnosis.  It didn't seem like I was actively doing anything to contribute that was under my control, so much as my just having the audacity to have problems that didn't fit with my diagnosis and not being able to just decide to stop having them when it was convenient for the therapist.  Like if I was diagnosed with GAD, therapy was going to find out how I was overreacting and fix that, and to hell with what might actually be going on.

But again, we're seeing a half-a-dozen therapists do this, at least.  More people once we include other supporting mental health professionals as well.  And that's what baffles me - it's like just me existing and having trauma issues somehow was driving therapists who had not diagnosed me with anything related to trauma to recreate the abusive environment."

I find it interesting you say this because I think my problem was the exact opposite.  Because I'm labelled female and because the abuse was coming from my mother, all touch was automatically *desexualized*.  And not sexual automatically meant no trauma.  Never mind that the affection was was horribly forced and often in fact painful, and that in many cases it was very clear that the motive was control rather than healthy love.  The simple fact that it was coming from a woman and not explicitly sexual meant it wasn't traumatic.

I also grew up in the classic example of a stable family; a father who worked a regular 9-5 middle class job and was reliably home on evenings and weekends, and a full time stay at home mother.  That impacted as well, I think, because I grew up with domestic violence but no one really saw it as a problem because it was female on male.

And the thought disorder mindset worked very hard to convince me of these things.  I really got the sense that therapy was more about correcting my thoughts to match more socially acceptable biases, rather than actually helping me."
CPTSD,fpbtzx3,t1_fpblytm,1588478680.0,"The interesting aspect for me is that the thought-based therapies weren't just not working in the sense of not fully dealing with trauma.

And I felt very much that there was a significant push in therapy, since I was not diagnosed with trauma, to deny anything that might indicate trauma.  Like the techniques themselves were built so the only possible answer was to confirm that I did in fact have the depression and/or anxiety (caused by distorted thinking) that I was diagnosed with."

mentalhealth,fopp4e6,t1_fopnguj,1587967712.0,"A major underlying issue here is that an abuse victim is extremely likely - as was the case for me - to enter therapy unaware that they're being abused.  Someone like me is entering therapy uncertain, knowing that something is obviously wrong but unsure about what.  If I had the ability to recognize the problem and shop around like that at the time, then quite frankly I wouldn't have had much reason to go to therapy in the first place.

The complaint I'm having is that the CBT techniques work *specifically* to convince people like me that we are being helped by CBT when we're not and to mislead them about what they need.  Not just that it's not working.  (I also remember them being used to reframe any sort of thinking that maybe therapy wasn't working as also stemming from my anxiety, and being told what I was experiencing was the normal temporary difficulties of changing thinking patterns.)

So yes, it absolutely IS the therapist's fault if they're handing someone in therapy CBT when CBT is actively convincing them that the underlying issue is other than what it is and that they shouldn't get help for the real issue.  And that's what's happening here; not just that CBT isn't working but that the client is being told it is working and shown, using CBT, that the issue they really need help with doesn't exist at all.  I was diagnosed with GAD and getting what, according to my research, was the best treatment for GAD.  Trouble is I actually needed treatment for C-PTSD, but I wasn't diagnosed with that and the therapy techniques were incorrectly reframing any memories that might lead me to realize that as symptoms of my anxiety.

So yes, I did do my research.  The trouble is my research wasn't good enough to overcome an entire system built in a way that continually reinforced a misdiagnosis.  With things like abuse, or with things like ADHD as I mentioned in my previous comment, that sort of modality research isn't really helpful unless the client already has a good idea of what their problem is - and that simply isn't a realistic expectation for many people."
mentalhealth,fopmwd0,t1_fopk90g,1587965850.0,"I think a lot of my question is how we're sussing out such things.

The whole process seemed to have a sort of self-reinforcing effect where it could both be actually causing a lot of damage to the client and at the same time giving evidence of progress to the therapist, and there really didn't seem to be much consideration of that.

I'm ok with it having its place in therapy, but I really want a better answer to how we judge if a situation is appropriate for CBT or not than ""common sense"" or similar.  Because right now the process often in practice seems to be to go ahead unless there's an obvious contraindication, and then CBT makes it even harder to find out non obvious ones.  And clients aren't given any guidance at all on when to and when to not use CBT techniques that they learned from therapy on their own."

I'm especially concerned about situations like this where you create an environment where the actual problem is getting worse, but the therapist believes they're helping and is leading the client to believe they're being helped.

On the level playing field comment, I could mention that I've also seen CBT do something similar with undiagnosed ADHD without anyone actively trying to game the system.  You get something like where occasional periods of hyperfocus are used as evidence that beliefs in a general problem are distorted thinking.  There's no intentional gaming involved, just a therapy method that deals poorly with the reality.

That's the question.  Sure, maybe CBT is a poor tool for what was actually going on.  But it's the tool that very often gets used and that very often people are told will help them, and it's a tool that can often function to actively block off the evidence that it's not actually helping.  That's what I'm questioning - why are we being regularly handed and told to use a tool that can get us hurt, but then not given any safety instructions and led to believe we're not being hurt after all?

Not just bad fits.

I'm literally waking up shaking/crying routinely in the middle of the night from the trauma caused by prior therapy.  That's the thing people don't mention.  ""Keep trying"" means keeping trying within a system where you might end up with help, or you might end up with significant additional psychological damage, and there don't seem to be any particular systemic safeguards to make sure you get the first and not the second.

Several of those ""bad fit"" experiences were also to some degree or another coerced.  Which is part of why I'm concerned about safeguards on the therapist side.  There's a lot of sort of gray area coercion that isn't officially recognized as coercion - e.g. having to be in treatment and showing that you're making progress as a condition of having access to safe housing.  So you're not technically legally locked in, but you're also not really free to just quit therapy without severe consequences.  There were also cases where therapist biases that were not clear from the outset (and in one case that I specifically know were coming from a supervisor I never even met before) led to me being falsely read as potentially suicidal or dangerous when I was not and told if I didn't cooperate they would have to put me inpatient.

Part of my concern personally is that people who are coming at it from a social power dynamics view can actually be *less* likely to recognize the issues I face.

CPTSD,fnsu7sw,t3_g3l64a,1587228881.0,"I think part of the problem is that we've restricted society to the point where the only options people accept are ""be in a committed romantic & sexual relationship with a life partner"" or ""be completely alone."""

You can draw up legal documents, but there's no good way to ensure the right people are notified at the right times if you're not able to tell them.  And shitty families often can't be trusted to not conveniently forget about things like power of attorney forms or wills."
bestoflegaladvice,fnsfwdb,t1_fns3mvu,1587220751.0,"Right, but they do still have a lot of additional legal obligations that aren't suited to everyone.  The obvious one is that the person you pick might, you know, want that partnership with someone else.  Plus it creates a big property mess quite easily even if you never live together or intend to share anything financially.  It's still designed for people entering a life partnership.

It's a legal contract that you can only enter into with one person at a time that has a lot of rights and responsibilities tied to it that aren't inherently related to each other except by all being the things that someone in a long term life partnership would want."
raisedbynarcissists,fnrmgjr,t1_fnrk97o,1587193719.0,"It wasn't just matching them up with suitable partners.  Nazi Germany was also closing off career and educational opportunities that had previously been available to women.  They also banned contraception and abortion for women who were deemed racially healthy (while of course promoting it for everyone else).  Their goal was to return to a society where the role for women was to be wives and mothers, regardless of the individual woman's desires or choices.  The ideal for the good Nazi woman was to have lots of healthy ethnically pure babies for the party.  And that's of course on top of being forbidden to marry or have sex with anyone who wasn't pure enough.

Sure it wasn't nearly as bad a level as what they did to practically everyone else.  But it wasn't about creating happy families; it was about getting women back at home having kids so they could have more of their master race."
raisedbynarcissists,fnrjqxp,t1_fnqzxob,1587191136.0,"> Psychology is a science. It wouldn’t be the person themselves determining the mental fitness of the prospective parents, but the science behind what a healthy minded person looks like.

The trouble is that psychology is still very heavily influenced by culture.  We'd like to think of it as a hard science that gives us definite results, but it really isn't.  It still hasn't been very many years since psychology said gay people were inherently unwell (and obviously not fit to parent).  Plus a lot of people who aren't necessarily mentally healthy still make good parents, while a lot of people who pass all our current tests abuse their kids."

bestoflegaladvice,fnregoi,t1_fnraxdc,1587186533.0,"> I'm an atheist and don't really care about marriage in a moral sense, but it's so important in a legal sense in so many ways.

All that said, I really wish there was just a way to designate a legal next of kin in a central database?  Because marriage isn't for everyone and sometimes people (especially if you have a shitty family) want to designate someone else to handle things without entering into a full life partnership.  POA's are *supposed* to cover that, but like you said there's really not any good way to ensure whoever might be making the contact is even aware of them."

mentalhealth,fnk0swh,t1_fnjymb9,1587011745.0,"Eh, that's...yes and no.  I don't think it was the diagnosis *exactly* that was the problem, but rather the base understanding of the root of the problem that was reflected in the diagnosis.  The trouble here is a failure to differentiate clearly someone who is suffering from anxiety and reacting in a way that is out of proportion to the situation, and someone who is reacting in proportion to a situation that is actually much worse than it seems."

mentalhealth,fnjwdad,t1_fnjuws6,1587008564.0,"I'm not sure that changes my point any though.

We're talking about maybe a half a dozen therapists, with a dozen more professionals who supported them, plus countless other people encouraging and pushing me to stick with it.  If professionals who suck that badly that they're doing this level of damage are that common, then it would call for drastic changes of our view of therapy and encouragement of people to get therapy that aren't happening."
mentalhealth,fnju9ay,t1_fnjtigb,1587007129.0,"US.  I have had this happen in at least 4 different states though, with unrelated professionals.

The trouble was that fundamentally they'd reversed everything.  They didn't understand how the trauma worked, because it didn't match with the sorts of trauma they were looking for.  So they'd decided that my anxiety issues were making me irrationally overreact to neutral events.  And they were applying treatment to get me to see how I was blowing things out of proportion and how I could fix the relationship with an abusive mother if I'd just reframe what she was doing to see how she loved me."
mentalhealth,fnjt153,t1_fnjswvu,1587006314.0,"But it's also the standard, perhaps even ethically required, practice for people you've diagnosed with anxiety and paranoia issues, especially if they don't have anything you recognize as trauma."
askatherapist,fnhwoqe,t1_fng1lm7,1586970108.0,"The biggest question I would have is how the therapist handles the concern that the client might falsely believe things are getting worse.  I recall in my own experiences that was a major issue - that push that it was to be expected of someone with certain issues to feel like they're getting worse.  Perhaps even a necessary stage of healing.  Obviously this is a bigger issue in longer term therapy.

The second question would be - is there any good way to account for potential biases that may affect both therapist and supervisor?  I mean here especially to include biases that are particularly culturally common.  (Without saying too much here, I do believe my own repeated failures were influenced in part by gender biases that are *extremely* common in american society.)  It could also include biases that are simply common to therapists - for example, a tendency to miss other issues when a particular client shows symptoms of a common mood disorder."
CPTSD,fnfkqdq,t1_fnfemiu,1586909972.0,Right.  The main problem is that relies on the client having in advance of therapy being able to identify prior trauma and connect their current issues to the traumatic experiences.  And that's a pretty major assumption; most people just go to a therapist because they feel like crap.
CPTSD,fnfcgt5,t1_fnf9y2h,1586905446.0,"Honestly it's more like I ended up with a half-dozen or so.  I think in my case it's that I just didn't fit well with what they were looking for.  I was too *competent* to be able to have the struggles I in fact had.  I also was a victim of a female abuser, and I think our tests and screens are not well designed for female abuse.  I think a lot of therapists just don't know how to spot and handle anything beyond depression and anxiety."
CPTSD,fnfcdf2,t1_fnfbgsd,1586905397.0,"Yeah - that has to be an option too.  And I think we need to have a better idea of who to refer them to.  A lot of my problem was that therapists were insisting I had anxiety, and I was being given tools for anxiety.  It's an issue right now that a lot of people may not even get a correct diagnosis initially."
CPTSD,fnfbsyh,t1_fnf8b19,1586905095.0,"Right.  And I think societal factors must also be given serious consideration.  Not all of this is coming from therapists.  I think some of it is coming quite simply from societal ideas about how mental health and mental illness work.  Even among people who are accepting of mental health struggles in general, it's common to find patronizing attitudes that regard those with mental illness sort of as children who need to listen to the grown-ups: in this case, the therapists.  We may not be regarded as at fault for being mentally ill, but we're still regarded as somehow not able to discern our own welfare.

These aspects cannot be ignored, as though the client and therapist were in isolation together.  They both live in a society that has certain attitudes towards mental illness.  The client is likely to find little outside support for challenging the therapist, even to be seen as irresponsible or demanding for seeking alternatives.  In contrast, the therapist is likely to be seen positively for spending their time helping the mentally ill.  That creates an imbalance even if the therapist themself attempts to treat the client as an equal."
