It makes sense to me for it to be a 1st person game, over the shoulder 3rd person is best for action games, whereas 1st person is more immersive, limiting the players view for a more helpless feeling whilst playing

I wouldn't personally say continuing with 1st person is an insult to the franchise at all and if RE8 follows RE7 even slightly in terms of gameplay and design, I'd be more than happy to buy it and play

Not saying RE7 was perfect, but it definitely scratched that survival horror itch I have, more so than a lot of the previous games

What would be the point in remaking anything past 3? RE4 had over the shoulder action as opposed to fixed camera angles. 

Over the shoulder was added because on the original consoles it wasn't possible to do this, so there was value in remaking 2 and 3 on new gen consoles as it gives the game a whole new viewpoint. 

I personally think it would be a waste of time to remake anything after 3 and I very much doubt I'd buy a RE4 remake if they made one."

Halo_5_Guardians,fjefq6d,t3_fd1jld,1583271003.0,"Here's a couple tips I posted in a thread a while back so I'll just paste them here, hopefully some might be useful to you 


Mele - 3 magnum shots + 1 Mele = kill, count your shots up close and only Mele when you've hit 3, that way you know they will die

Map positioning - high ground is your friend, gives a huge advantage, and there's nothing wrong with holding an advantageous position, don't feel you constantly have to run around

Pace - Sprint as little as possible, it allows you to react more quickly when you encounter an enemy

Aiming - really place your shots, don't panic and shoot as quickly as possible, only shoot when you think you'll hit

Strafe - If you're unfamiliar, strafing is moving left and right to avoid getting shot, but you have to mix it up and make yourself unpredictable. Crouching up and down occasionally while strafing is difficult but really good to help dodge incoming shots. The best thing to throw off an enemies aim is to strafe one side, jump and boost the opposite direction, works great to dodge a couple shots

Know when to retreat - a big part of playing is knowing when to take cover and let your shields recharge, keep your head down when retreating it will make headshots on you more difficult

Teamwork - might be obvious but teamwork is so important. Try this if you play solo, whenever you spawn find the closest teammate and stick close to them, it's very difficult for anyone in a 2 V 1 situation, so yes you may be more likely to get assists, but you'll die less

Utilise the full arsenal - pick up and experiment with other weapons, the carbine is great for cover fire due to its fast rate of fire, people getting spammed by a carbine usually retreat. The SMG is great up close and personal, fire off some shots and go in for the Mele. The Assault Rifle is actually better than the magnum is very close quarters because it can deplete a shield more quickly to allow for a single Mele hit kill. Plasma pistol is good if the enemy have an overshield because it depletes it instantly

Learn from your mistakes - instead of getting angry when you die, try and figure out why you died, they had the high ground? You didn't retreat when you should have? They were just a better player? It's important to understand you die, everyone will die. Try and appreciate the gameplay, if I get sniped across the map midair at an impossible angle, instead of getting irritated ill think wow to be fair that was actually a good shot

Also this is a very specific tip, but if you ever find someone is sprinting towards you with an Energy Sword, jump and boost towards them over their head, I've found it works a lot of the time, gives you a couple seconds because it disorientates them a little

Also, I'd recommend to play slayer for the map size, action is always just around the corner instead of half a map away like on warzone"
