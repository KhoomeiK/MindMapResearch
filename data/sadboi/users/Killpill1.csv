Itâ€™s just much more dangerous for a woman to be on the street this is why u see less women but make no mistake women are also in situations where itâ€™s not because they want to be there.

You can break children early by not attending to them correctly in the earliest years. Parenting is very bad these days since the state or other people raise the kids now not the parents. Some people can make u feel loved at least in the beginning stages of a relationship but then u begin to see that they are not really capable over time.

He never got from me and we had unconcerned most of the time. But yea go into it prepared like u will lose him if u decide to tell. Donâ€™t trip if he breaks up with u, u might need to let him calm down and process the situation. So do not beg and plead in the event he says I donâ€™t think we can see each other anymore.

Lovingly detach. You donâ€™t have to abandon her, just let her know how much she means to u and u are ok with whatever she chooses to do. If u panic it doesnâ€™t help and probably fuels her worse.

Men will do what u allow them to get away with. The man that truly loves u will respect your boundaries and expectations obviously within reason but u know what I mean. But men fall in love not with the woman who kiss their ass, do everything for them, or let them get away with bad behavior. They fall in love with the woman who makes them better. So itâ€™s not what u give to a man that makes them fall in love wether itâ€™s sex, can be the best sex ever and he still wonâ€™t commit to u if u donâ€™t love yourself and make him work to earn u. This guy might be a player too, u need to learn the warning signs of emotionally unavailable men too. I just went through this too u are not alone."

BreakUps,fhd2bio,t3_f2gw70,1581475793.0,"I know it sucks this happened to me too, where I was having sex with a guy I liked a lot over the course of many months, it ended abruptly because of something on my part but he didnâ€™t want to stop seeing me I scared him away. Anyway the problem was it was a situationship or casual sex. The issue for women is that sex creates strong attachment in us but casual sex is different for guys they can have the best sex with u but not feel anything. They donâ€™t need more than that. This is why itâ€™s so important for women not to have sex unless the guy is genuinely into u and has proven this. Itâ€™s hard nowadays to get a guy to commit because of the easy sex they are acclimated to because of womenâ€™s liberation with welfare state, birth control, easy abortion, and easy divorce makes men think twice about committing because they can lose a lot in divorce. Itâ€™s altered how men behave unfortunately. To get a guy to fall in love with us we have to respect ourselves, and not allow them to get away with treating us this way. Hopefully u are still young and u can find someone better than this guy. Iâ€™m much older and I no longer have the youth and beauty to attract men."

Adderall is one of these drugs where it starts off nice for some years even but then u realize you are now forever dependent potentially. It causes changes to your dopamine system over time because u keep flooding it, to a degree this repairs itself when u stop but it can take a long time."

I ended up dependent and it ruined relationships. I never took more than amount u are prescribed often much less but it didnâ€™t matter. It still caused me to have adrenal fatigue, my appetite was shit, sleeping issues, dental issues bc of dry mouth and grinding at night. You often need additional pills to manage side effects.

adderall,fhbzihr,t3_f2dbyr,1581453161.0,Adderall sadly does cause some brain damage and the longer u use it the worse it is and the longer it takes to go back to how u were without it. They wonâ€™t tell u this though. Maybe not permanent brain damage but it does to some degree depending on wether u abuse the drug too. Just because itâ€™s legal does not mean itâ€™s much different from crack or meth. Itâ€™s very close in molecular structure and u will experience the same side effects over time. The legality and bc a psych gives it to u not a dealer off the street makes people assume it is deemed safe but nothing can be further from the truth. You can try modafinil but Iâ€™m not sure where u can get it prescribed. Itâ€™s not speed but itâ€™s much less bad for u than amphetamines.

BorderlinePDisorder,fhb31ey,t3_f1yiqy,1581433670.0,You have to go into a relationship or dating with an intention to actually find the right person with shared values and goals. This is why u keep jumping from person to person because u are not really going into it to find someone where it can last and u know what u want. It is unhealthy because your youth is fleeting and this tends to become unsatisfying after awhile. You wonâ€™t get long term stability and meaning unless u commit to someone that u can build with. Also the more people you sleep with especially for women it is more impactful to have casual sex than it is for a guy. So itâ€™s harmful for girls to have too many partners as u begin to lose ability to pair bond each time u give your heart to a new guy but then have to start over again. You end up used up.
relationship_advice,fhax8th,t3_f1wiz9,1581429545.0,"Yes actually u are thinking rationally and not hoping for this ideal woman that probably doesnâ€™t exist. If the main components are there. Shared values, decent mental health, good morals, cooperation. Itâ€™s likely to work out longterm if the main stuff is there bc sexual attraction will fade to some degree over time no matter who u marry."
SuicideWatch,fhawhho,t3_f1x7r4,1581428957.0,"This was the unfortunate reason I went off the rails as a young lady. I thought I was gonna have to work all the time and that was so miserable I tried to find other ways to avoid a real job lol! The boredom and frustration was too much for me at most jobs not to mention the low pay to put up with sadistic bosses and shitty coworkers. I know right I had that mentality where I thought I was entitled not to have to work a lowly job and feel dicked around. The only thing u can do is attempt to start a business because as long as u have to work for somebody else u are at their mercy. You have to kiss someoneâ€™s ass just to make a living. I mean u do have to please customers to make a living but it sucks wen u have to deal with bad bosses and shitty work conditions added to it. I hate someone else controlling my time, income capacity, and work conditions."
adderall,fhav22c,t3_f23clu,1581427831.0,"You should look into testosterone supplementation if u can, it isnâ€™t just an older person issue having low T. Many people are low bc of chemicals from various sources, probably interfering with production. This can be a reason u have focus,brain fog, attention, and energy problems but u will never hear this from a psychiatrist. Women need testosterone too not just men. So many women struggle with this issue as well and have no idea. Itâ€™s expensive though. You have to go to a hormone place specifically to get blood checked for hormone levels. It isnâ€™t a good idea to be on adderall or use before gym but as long as u donâ€™t go too high with the dose Iâ€™m sure u probably wonâ€™t die anytime soon especially because u are young still. Adderall is one molecule away from crack cocaine or meth so donâ€™t be fooled that itâ€™s not a dangerous drug just because itâ€™s legal."
therewasanattempt,fhato8n,t3_f25uwn,1581426651.0,I want that wheel thing lol! Thatâ€™s a nice cat toy
adderall,fhat73j,t3_f245ma,1581426226.0,It does stop working as well if u take it everyday. You do build tolerance. Then thereâ€™s the adrenal fatigue because your flight fight response is activated when on stimulants which eventually leaves u wired up but then still tired. It could be your testosterone is low too.

SuicideWatch,fh8frvq,t1_fh8c1su,1581358799.0,I know lol! Sometimes Iâ€™m a shit ðŸ˜‚
SuicideWatch,fh850mk,t3_f1kx5u,1581352169.0,Iâ€™m afraid of psych meds. At one time I was on 5 different ones. I was a zombie lol! They didnâ€™t help much with borderline. I went through the entire list of commonly prescribed meds and I got so sick of having to always remember not to run out because heaven help u if u go into withdrawal and u have to call off sick for a job. It was such a hassle.
BreakUps,fh83nb9,t3_f1s4mt,1581351304.0,No u should not. Because wen they find someone else thatâ€™s gonna suck being in the friend zone. Watch some lovechat on YouTube. Or coach lee
