TalkTherapy,fp5njgy,t3_gbdmdl,1588335243.0,"Oh man, I really relate to this. Realistically, I know everyone experiences life differently, and what might be small trauma for one person might be life-alteringly horrible for someone else. But when I apply that logic to myself it just feels like an excuse I'm using to not improve. I think its probably helpful to tell your therapist that you're feeling this way, if you can. Maybe they can talk through all of your questions with you in session, so you can explore these feelings together. You could even show them this post, if you're having a hard time vocalizing how you feel. 

Regardless, know that you're not the only person who feels this way, and you're not a failure. You're going to therapy to improve yourself. That, to me, already proves you're not lazy, because you're working to get through this. I'm proud of you, keep working ❤"

OCD,fo2vjbz,t3_g5cizw,1587475110.0,"I'm so sorry you have to deal with this, especially with quarantine being such a stressful time on its own. I don't know that i have any advice for you, but since you're not hearing this at home, I want you to hear it from someone:

You are so strong. Every little step counts, every time you resist the urge to complete a ritual, every time you practice positive self-talk, every time you forgive yourself, or are patient with yourself, or love yourself, that is huge. Even if your mom isn't being supportive, know that you are supported and you are part of a community who knows what you're going through and is proud of you for every step you take, even if they feel like steps backwards. You're doing a great job, and I'm proud of you for practicing positivity even when you're surrounded by such a negative environment"

Dermatillomania,fo2oqia,t3_g5bt80,1587469948.0,"Hi love, I'm so sorry this happened to you. Picking is so hard on its own, and there's so much shame already involved, let alone with someone yelling at you. I just want you to know that you are not a bad person because you pick. You are still strong and beautiful and so many other positive attributes that you bring to this world. If you want to talk to your grandmother about this, you can. But if you don't think she'll be supportive, you absolutely do not owe her an explanation. Support and kindness is what you need and deserve while you work through this.

Personally, I find taking a long, hot shower and then using a mixture of neosporin and thick moisturizer helps me feel more whole after a really bad picking session. I make sure to go slow, and be aware of how good the water and soap or moisturizer feels, being present in the moment. Sometimes it helps, sometimes I can't do that, and thats okay too."

I worked my ass off for where I was and, though I may have had to prove myself more to some people over others, i generally was not impeded by my gender. (Largely, like you said, because I came from an upper middle class family.) However, the second I started working on a construction site as an engineer and the sole woman on site, that changed. My coworkers (only management, not laborers, in my experience they're cool) constantly talk negatively about women, about their wives, and excusing it with ""oh you know how you women are."" While I recognize not all women have this experience, many do. And this may not be a ""structural barrier to success,"" but there are a significant number of women who drop out of stem the higher they go into the field because they don't feel included or welcomed. I'd call that a social barrier at the very least. The amount of negativity I've experienced is almost enough to kick me out, and if I didn't have the support system I had I probably would have left 6 months ago."

Then: Take screenshots of the texts just in case and email them to yourself with a description of how you're feeling and what's going on at the time. Make sure you have times and dates of the interaction(s). The more of a paper trail you have, the better. If the police are an option, go there, they may be able to point you in the right direction and help get a restraining order if need be. If not, absolutely get in contact with Human Resources at the hospital. They may also be able to remove you from the class or move you into a different one.
