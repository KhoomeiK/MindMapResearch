You have a 80% chance of losing so there is a little more than 10% chance that you will have 10 consecutive losses

If you want to be able to trade after taking this string of losses which is quite probable since it has a 10% chance of occurring you can fix a max drawdown of lets say 30% for this so you should risk a maximum of 3% of your capital per trade

Similarly if you risk upto 10% of your capital per trade you are very likely to blow-up your account with this strategy"
