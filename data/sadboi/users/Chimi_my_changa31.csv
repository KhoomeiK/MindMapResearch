mentalhealth,fne6a4w,t3_g0rabm,1586883805.0,This was the message I didn‚Äôt know I needed right now. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è can be especially hard when others have placed those expectations on you and you don‚Äôt want to let them down or are ashamed that you have. But what you think of yourself matters most ‚ù§Ô∏è
aww,fne4mvx,t3_g0zgf2,1586882978.0,I just can‚Äôt stop watching it. So. Much. Cute.
findapath,fndropn,t1_fnci1ux,1586876207.0,How were you able to find out that information? Just curious (also an English major)
abusiverelationships,fndpx8s,t1_fndiypo,1586875238.0,Thanks for posting this link. I‚Äôve been struggling with figuring out a plan to leave
careerguidance,fnaywbq,t1_fn3984q,1586806257.0,"Just wanted to say i really appreciated the honest response you gave OP, it helped me a lot as well. Thank you :)"
careerguidance,fnayt9r,t3_fyukgi,1586806213.0,"OP- I‚Äôm in a similar situation. School always made sense for me and i excelled. Eventually i got to a prestigious law school, survived 1.5 years because everyone said it would get better, despite having enormous breakdowns almost daily, and finally dropped out last November to work on my mental health (i feel like being in law school permanently messed with my ability to manage stress, and I‚Äôm still really upset about that). Now I‚Äôm working towards finding out more about how i can become a mental health therapist but am afraid to take the jump you took- enrolling in an MA program in psych or social work. 

Also, i don‚Äôt think you should worry much about the visible tattoos- there seems to be an upward trend in accepting the visibility of tattoos in more corporate fields (I‚Äôve seen plenty of government lawyers with half and full sleeves- of course, when they go to court, they wear blazers). I would think psychology would be even more accepting. 

I just want to say that i feel your pain and I‚Äôm right here with you!"
CatsWhoSqueak,fnarnp6,t1_fn2otqo,1586802617.0,Thank you. For that link. My whole week has been made üò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
careerguidance,fnambi3,t3_g0kh4o,1586799969.0,"OP- we‚Äôre in a similar boat and a lot of the suggestions given about doing research in the mental health field are things I‚Äôve done and would be glad to share with you. You can most definitely pursue a mental health career after getting a grad degree. Depending on your specific interests, you could get a Masters in counseling, a Masters in social work, a Masters in Psychology (but Masters in psych doesn‚Äôt prep you for a licensing exam so you‚Äôd have to pursue a PhD for psych). 

Anyway, I‚Äôd be glad to chat with you about all of this over PM. I read your post and felt like you were reading my mind lol"
CatsWhoSqueak,fn10w87,t1_fn10u9y,1586552573.0,Oop! I knew that..
CatsWhoSqueak,fn0x03j,t1_fn0sl5o,1586550394.0,"Honestly, my significant other went with me when I dropped her off to another foster- that helped a lot! My foster coordinator was also really sweet in reminding me that I did something very kind and impactful for that kitty‚Äôs life- that‚Äôs what I tell myself now!"
CatsWhoSqueak,fn0s6v9,t3_fyig8e,1586547729.0,"She‚Äôs 13! I thought that was old, until i noticed a bunch of cute kitties on here are easily in their 20s"
CatsWhoSqueak,fn0pqlk,t1_fn0pkox,1586546408.0,"Lol nooo, I‚Äôm from the U.S."
HumansBeingBros,fn0n7rg,t1_fmzq758,1586545052.0,Just what i was thinking!! My mom (African American) had to teach my dad (white) how to do my sisters‚Äô and my hair!
HumansBeingBros,fn0mv7h,t3_fyaj40,1586544867.0,"Omg. So sweet. My poor dad had no idea how to deal with his 2 daughters‚Äô hair, let alone curly hair! My mom (black) had to teach him how to care for our curls :)"
CatsWhoSqueak,fn0h7ax,t1_fn0g2wy,1586541875.0,"Check to see if you have a local humane society or humane rescue alliance and on their website should be some options to volunteer and/or foster. I think alot of it depends on what resources your local shelter has. I‚Äôm near DC and they have a really robust shelter so all I had to do was sign up, watch some videos, then go to an orientation and I was matched with a kitty pretty quickly."
CatsWhoSqueak,fn0bslq,t1_fn0bm12,1586539054.0,I had lots of people visit her but I ended up giving her to another foster and they Ended up keeping her :)
CatsWhoSqueak,fn0boim,t1_fn0a1hf,1586538996.0,I almost kept her!! I was a student at the time though and couldn‚Äôt keep her :/
CatsWhoSqueak,fn0bjo7,t1_fn09k1l,1586538925.0,"Aww thank you! She was actually my first foster ever and I had to try really hard not to just keep her! Lol i wish more people would give cats a chance, they‚Äôre such great little companions!! 

Side note: I LOVE the reddit cat community, y‚Äôall are great!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fn01mr0,t3_fydno5,1586533789.0,"I only realized my boyfriend is a Narc (or some sort of ridiculously manipulative toxic guy) after my sister introduced me to the Narc subreddits about a month ago And after I realized that my boyfriend cared more about our new puppy than the fact that the puppy has been physically attacking me. I‚Äôm still with him now because he‚Äôs kind of financially supporting me (kind of because he pays the rent, but i pay for most of everything else) and this Coronavirus lockdown stuff means it‚Äôs hard for me to find a more permanent job than the retail one I have/had. I am actively (and secretly) looking for cheap apartments in different states though."
