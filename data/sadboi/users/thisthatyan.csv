I don't care if the earth dies and the species goes extinct. I don't have a single friend or person I trust like I did her. I feel completely alone.

i am currently going through this, and while i feel exactly the same way you do, trust that it will get better. do the right things, take care of YOUR SELF, your emotional, physical, and mental health. this will sound rather morbid and fucked up, but it's something that i tell myself daily. ""if im not going to off myself here and now, then i must carry on."" if i am choosing to rise with the sun everyday then I must do everything within my power to make my days as meaningful and worthwhile as possible. I personally find, that providing solace to the people around me in their times of need helps me feel better. even though my life is in absolute shambles, I helped someone else climb out of this hole that I have lived in and will continue to live in. I know you feel alone. I feel alone in rooms full of people, people who tell me they love me. I know how alone you feel. this too shall pass. you can DM me anytime should you need support or just someone to vent to. hang in there please. stay strong, stranger."
