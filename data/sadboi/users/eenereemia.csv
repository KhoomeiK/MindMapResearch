ptsd,fmfohbl,t3_fuxfdt,1586031550.0,"A lot of emotions happen, a lot of memories and ""flash backs"" but it's the only thing that has ever resolved things for me. Get to know and trust your therapist first so you can feel safe reliving some things. 

I feel so amazing and refreshed afterwards. I can think about triggering events without losing it, and I can do things with a peace of mind knowing I won't be triggered, or as strongly triggered again. But even if I am, I can take that trigger to my therapist and do EMDR and work to process through it."

I can't always place who is who, but I definitely notice different physical symptoms in conjunction with different emotions and behaviors. 

The most clear one to me is my young 6 year old girl resides... Or controls... (I also am not avid in the proper terminology) primarily the left side of my chest and in my left arm. When I am feeling a lot of clinginess, fear of abandonment, and extreme anxiety I also feel an extreme heaviness and pressure in the left side of my chest and arm. I am gathering that she is left-handed because on a couple occasions I have been compelled to write left-handed when I have felt her presence. 

I also notice sometimes I feel pain in my legs and other times I don't, or pressure in my forehead, or back of my head... Sometimes I am lactose intolerant sometimes I am not, sometimes I am sensitive to certain foods or crave certain foods and other times they I am absolutely befuddled by what I've eaten or avoided... 

Essentially I am trying to list physical symptoms with emotions and behaviors and find patterns... Otherwise I really have no idea how to identify who I am and when..."
