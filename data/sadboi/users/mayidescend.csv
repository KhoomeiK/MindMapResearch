TalesFromTheCustomer,fqhqi87,t3_gioipk,1589382366.0,"I’m someone who has always been scared to ask for a refund or anything- even if its not what I asked for.
Recently I ordered something on a website where people make and sell their own products. 
I was purchasing some personalized bed for my pet. My dog is older and requires an orthopedic bed to keep her joints and back in check, but she doesn’t like the flat surface. I found someone who made a bed with two layers of orthopedic material with memory foam and pillow cushion in between (looked like a giant plush princess pillow). The cover for the bed could be personalized with words and your choice fabric.
Since I was already going to be spending so much money on this bed anyway, I decided to get a ultra plush fabric and have my dogs name put on it.
Since she is a brick shaped, medium/large pit mix, her bed was going to be big, hence the price going up.

Her bed was going to be close to $200 (my dog is spoiled and I will do anything to make sure she stays healthy and happy for as long as possible). I thought it was worth it deem the quality, reviews of the seller, and that it will help assist my dog live to a healthy old age happily. 

I messaged the seller BEFORE I officially bought the items in my cart, asking how long it would take, what the return policy is (they didn’t have a specific policy on their user/shop profile).
They said that they already have the bed itself made, they would just have to make the bed cover and that would take roughly 5 days to get to with their current work load, and they could finish it in a day since most of their materials work electronically. Depending on when she got it done (day of the week wise) it would take 6-8 days to mail out. She also never addressed my question on refunds.

Well.
I ordered it, very excited, and waited a month, messaging her maybe once a week asking the status and if I could have a picture.
After a month, I began to message daily for two weeks asking when she plans on shipping it, and if she hasn’t completed the order yet, if I could have a refund. If she had completed the order, could I get a photo as proof it was completed.

So at that point a month and a half had passed with no response since I made my order.
I messaged her saying that if she doesn’t respond that I will file a ‘claim’ (i think is what it was called?) on the order I placed with her.

She eventually replied at that point saying ‘I haven’t started your order. Plan on starting it when I get back from my trip’. Her shop wasn’t on ‘vacation’, and at that point I honestly just wanted the refund so I could purchase the bed elsewhere. Also her state at that point (she was located in one of the states that had a lot of outbreak) was in lockdown. 

I messaged her for another week every day asking for a refund, and that I did not care to have my product due to the lack of communication.

I filed a claim after having no response and within 24 hours, the website had issued a refund.

Less than 10 minutes after I got my refund, the shop owner sent me a picture of her putting my dogs name on a fabric I didn’t choose and called me a ‘b*tch’ for taking her money away from her.


I’m pretty sure her shop got removed, because I cannot find it now that I’m looking for it. The whole situation made me realize if I don’t get what I paid for, then its not worth it. Up until that small experience I kinda took whatever."

When I finally grew a pair and said no to taking them home (they didn’t give me gas money even though I had asked, and their mom told them to, and I continued to drive them for two months 4 days a week), they went back to snapping on me for not using zer/zem.

She still has the beak power to be able to break the others necks if she wants, so I have to always be careful even if I know she means no harm.

Her and the conures are super close, though. The conures are also much faster than her, and are on xanax or something (not really, but conures are little crack heads).
I don’t think its in her personality to hurt them, but I know it’s physically possible for it to happen so I always have to be careful.
If the macaw is acting all hormonal, or if the conures are having the airplanes in king Kong energy, I don’t let them around one another. Trust and a good relationship with the macaw is also essential, because its easier to tell when her mood shifts by just looking at her when nothing has appeared to change.
I have that relationship with everyone but the darker conure. I remain clueless and distant with her, but she is hand tame. 

The macaw with the cockatiels: they just kinda sit there, then the macaw is like ‘lemme lick you’ and they hiss at her, and then they are both sitting again.

AmItheAsshole,fpgdukb,t1_fpf5lft,1588600656.0,"In highschool, i spent one of my classes tutoring those who do fall under the category of ‘special needs’. They all had Moderate to severe disabilities ranging from Down syndrome to different forms of autism or brain damage.
One girl was in a car accident and had part of her body paralyzed, and had pretty severe brain damage.
She was in a wheelchair.
She had muscle issues and couldn’t really do much on her own.
She was truly disabled and special needs with how her learning abilities went from her brain damage.

Guess what? When her mom or teachers werent there- she thrived because all of her peers and friends helped her because thats what good humans do.
She would go to parties because she genuinely liked being with friends, and guess who wasn’t there? Her family.
Her family trusted her friends, and her friends and peers even had phone numbers in case of emergency.
Not once did someone have to be called because her friends took her welfare seriously and made sure not to mess up so they could continue to enjoy her company and see her again.
Not once did I hear of her family calling friends to check up. Her family trusted her and trusted her friends. Her family knew what was happened was important to her social development and feeling of independence. Important to feeling like a human and not an object owned by her parents.


I know it to this degree because i was this girls best friend before her accident, and whenever she was introduced back into school years later (a time before social media), she came back and I got to attend the parent teacher conferences so I could display how I tutor each of their kids. Her family remembered me from literally 7 years prior and just... told me everything (that and I got to witness a lot myself).


You are crazy and controlling. Keep at it and your daughter won’t be able to have experiences that actually shape her into a full functioning adult.
Yes she will need help, but my friend needed help and THRIVED because not only did she know how to ask for help, but she was able to develop relationship and TRUST with people other than her family that she knew she could depend on- and her family trusted her to know whats right and who to trust as well.


Shame on you for keeping your daughter away from her proper social development, from learning how to get along without her mum and for wanting to keep her away from her friend(s) because you disagree on something.
Your daughter is not you. Your daughter and you will disagree on things, including sometimes friends. You can’t control who she speaks to, you can only control who she spends time with and how- and as long as drugs or illegal doings aren’t taking place- whats so wrong with it?
If her friend is truly bad, she needs to figure it out for herself and not have her mummy hold her hand the whole way doing it.
I dont think her friend is bad though. I think her friend is showing her what independence can look like whilst disabled and she wants to experience it too.

For smaller birds it is a bit more difficult since they usually have to poop more frequently.
Blue and gold macaws poop an average of 15 times a day. So they are a bit more manageable.

I have a few other rescues that are small birds and I’ve managed to ‘house train’ two of them. I can’t go more than 20-40 minutes without getting up to take them, or hearing them fly to their cage/play stand to poop.
My macaw on the other hand will sometimes wait 3-4 hours before flying or waddling over to her cage or play stands.

You essentially train them to poop less.
Most birds just poop whenever, but like most animals, they don’t like to poop where they sleep (for the most part) and hold their poop in all night. Then poop whenever they get a feeling during the day.
So they have the ability to hold it, you just have to train them. 

Not all birds are willing to be trained, and not all birds even know how to hold it through the night. I would say the majority of birds are able to.
That way there isn’t poop everywhere.
Having birds fully flighted helps too. That way they can be in control of going back to their cage or playstands to use the bathroom and come back.
Gives them more independence."

Like heck, dude. If you ask for feedback/opinions, and you get an opinion, thought, etc and you rebuttal every single one, what are you doing? Trolling? Being a nuisance? Being ignorant? I would check a yes for all three on those.


Your goldfish shouldn’t share a tank even if they look ‘happy’ and swim around because they are meant to be in water that isn’t heated. 
Many goldfish are what I would call a ‘durable’ fish. Meaning, they can survive in not ideal conditions. The key word is ‘survive’. Any GOOD fish owner should strive for their fish to ‘thrive’ in their tank. Not merely ‘survive’ ether due to lack of research/resources and acting anyway, refusing to re-home fish, just doing things because you like the look of it despite actually knowing better, or in your case: pure ignorance and arrogance. You are not being a good owner. This belongs on shittyaquariums or whatever it is.
If you acknowledged your problem, and set a plan to fix it, then you would be okay. Don’t rebuttal what people tell you. A lot of the people in r/aquarium have been in the hobby, learning how to perfect it longer than I have been alive, and probably you too.
Respect them and what they’ve spent their lives learning, and believe it or not, they’ll help you. They are all about fish welfare and having the most bomb ass aquarium.

You have to stop the uncalled for, honestly ill educated rebuttal, though.



Here are some ways goldfish are negatively impacted in heated water but may still appear to be ‘happy and swimming around!’:
Link one: http://completegoldfishcare.com/goldfish-tank/goldfish-and-tropical-fish/


Fishclaimer: Goldfish live in ponds during summer months are fine, but in the heat for too long and they can experience problems. They also stay in ponds during winter months and can experience problems if the water gets too frigid.
The ideal temp for a gold fish is 19-23 C or 67-74 F. What most water is room temperature.

Platys and guppies is around 75-84 F
It seems like a small difference, but they can feel it. And they probably aren’t as comfortable as they all could be in proper conditions.

unpopularopinion,foyhe37,t1_foy4r5n,1588172560.0,"When I was in highschool, i had an iPhone 5. I lived in country backroads (like 35 minutes on a back curvy foresty road from any form of business or main road). I remember a bad storm knocked down a bunch of power lines and left the house I lived in and a bunch of others without power.
Well, since it was summer, my family didn’t care too much. We had free air conditioning if we opened all the windows, and we lived far enough away from major light pollution to actually get light from the stars and moon some.
Plus a heck ton of candles.

Well. The power company (or someone i don’t remember exactly who) had to rewire each of the 8 houses.
Well, that took time, and we were the last on the list.
My house was without power for a month and a half.
Luckily, I had school activities that start in the summer to go to. Charged my phone and backup batteries there in the gym or cafeteria.

Before the activities started, my phone died. But i would try to turn it back on a few times and it would show a black screen with an empty battery. Implying that it had enough power to at least do that.
Eventually, i think about after 9 ish days of it being ‘dead’ and me just checking to see if it would turn on, it stopped doing that. It would just stay black, buttons wouldn’t give.
It was like a samsung I had before when the battery fell out or I took it out.
It took a little over a week for it to quit responding at all.
During the time of no power, I did quite a bit of writing and drawing of things I haven’t really done before. For example: I began to do interior design drawings.
Up to that point, I had never googled interior design, never really thought about it until I was laying there with no internet, no contact to the outside world, and just thinking about what I could do.
I talk to myself quite a bit. My ‘dead’ phone was in my room as I went through the different ideas and talked myself through them.

When it was finally time for my summer school activities, I got my phone off the gymnasium wall after the first day of practice and opened Facebook, and tons and tons of interior design school or apps advertisements.

The cat never brought back another snake.

AskReddit,foqxjjc,t1_fopisx4,1588002574.0,"I also had a huge ass binder full of the first two gens of Pokémon in order. Even had some of the holographic ones or original japanese ones behind the originals as ‘surprises’ for when I show them to people.

My mom got married to someone with two boys my age and they took my binder and told me ‘girls weren’t allowed to like pokemon’. As me and my FEMALE cousin the same age as me collected them and each basically had the same collection and felt the same intensity- i knew it was wrong.

I made a big stink about it, got my book back, all my ‘surprise’ cards were gone, and like 15 pages were gone (a small dent, but still devastating).

As I worked on the book mostly at my dads house, my mom only vaguely knew of pokemon when i begged her to play a game with me and let her pick her cards out, and she would only pick the cute ones.

But when I got my book back and complained about the missing cards and pages, my stepdad straight up TOOK the book and gave it to them. They took all of the cards out of the binder and just gave me the binder and empty card pages.
I was quite upset.
I never got any of them back, and often found some with rips, tears, and folding cracks lying around the house.

If i had it today, I probably wouldn’t sell it.

I also had the first gen plushies i kept at my dads house. My house got broken into and like ALL of them got stolen.

parrots,fobssyg,t3_g6qv4c,1587663281.0,"Metal can be bad for birds feet to perch on continuously! To prevent ‘bubble feet’ from happening, i layered colored vet wrap around the areas that my birds will be prone to perch the most, avoiding the areas that the birds will poop (poop is harder to clean on vet wrap compared to metal) and then did the final layer with black vet wrap to blend with the metal.

The reason I did colors underneath (bright neon colors) is so I can tell if my birds pick at the tape or if it begins to unravel with ease.

The vet tape is also easy to climb on, but its still a kind of fabric, so nails can be caught on it.
So if you take the same route i did with vet tape, make sure your birds nails are filed/trimmed appropriately so they don’t get caught.

Playtime should always be supervised anyway ✨

It was September 2010 and it was snowing (not sticking, but snowing, so it was too cold for puppies) and the puppies didn’t even have a blanket or anything to keep warm besides each other.
The walmart employees said that the puppies had been out there all day.
I took one and shes been my best friend since.
The puppies were nearly 4 weeks old.
The people responsible basically gave the puppies a death sentence.
The humane society eventually came and got the puppies not knowing anything that wasn’t on the cardboard sign.

I still think the people my dog came from are absolute trash. I DNAd her eventually to find out what breeds she was, and one of her parents were purebred, and I’m assuming thats why the people didn’t want anything to do with them: the dad probably wasn’t.
They had the breed listed as ‘mom is pitbull dad is maybe boxer’
Dad was an even mix of pitbull, boxer, with some beagle in there.
But I’m taking thats why they didn’t want them.

When my dog is bad I threaten to take her back to walmart, but I’d never do it. She wags her tail and thinks we are playing, and then we actually do play. Lol."

parrots,fnsl10u,t1_fnse03f,1587223794.0,"I worked in a rescue and a bird was brought in with burns on the feet (owner died, bird didn’t leave the cage and just sat where it was most comfortable, the heated perch until family surrendered it and cage). The pads on the feet were badly scared and slightly mutated.
Apparently it was 2-3 months since the owner passed. 
I know that the perch all together isn’t bad in idea, but knowing the conure could get burns from just sitting on it, it gives me bad vibes.

The cage had many other perches, so there is a possibility that the bird could have been on others too, i mean, it had to in order to eat and drink.
Maybe its the brand, or a factory mess up heat wise, but it was alarming. 

It was an nanday conure on a heated perch for a budgie/cockatiel, so smaller and theoretically less heat, and still burned.

They aren’t necessary, but birds do enjoy them. As long as the owners take proper precautions, i suppose its okay.

The rescue i was at had heaters for birds in the drafty parts of the buildings, and always put them towards the top of the cage (so they cant perch on them and) so they will be more likely to sleep with them and won’t feel the draft. The heaters themselves were okay.
Where they never put their skin against it, it seemed to work better. Had their feathers as insulation. A lot of the birds still favored and enjoyed the heaters when it was warm out and the draft would usually be an enjoyable thing.

This is the heater we used in about 9-12 cages: https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/kandh-snuggle-up-bird-warmer-large-3012138?cm_mmc=PSH-_-GGL-_-CAL-_-PME-_-PET-_-AQU-_-0-_-PM_GGL_FY20_SBU05_SH13_SmallAnimalBird&ReptileSupplies_BirdSupplies_PLA-SMRT-_-Product_Listing_Ads-_-Smart_Shopping&ReptileSupplies_BirdSupplies_PLA-SMRT-_-Product_Listing_Ads-_-Smart_Shopping&kpid=go_9417057307_98040481600_419469353026_pla-889276192729_m&utm_config=tad0iunwp&utm_campaign=PM_GGL_FY20_SBU05_SH13_SmallAnimalBird&ReptileSupplies_BirdSupplies_PLA-SMRT&ReptileSupplies_BirdSupplies_PLA-SMRT&utm_source=google&gclid=Cj0KCQjwyur0BRDcARIsAEt86IBWVIsqUutD1wrfvpEoIo3ZSt1d8jH5RDIUIR5wf0PH_Og0Yt-iF-oaAhFwEALw_wcB

This brand is reliable. Not for the bigger birds, but for small ones with beaks that wont break the thick plastic.
The heated perch that came to us was not the same brand. Unsure of what brand it is now thinking back, but I would assume if you’re going to get a heated perch, K&H would be the way to go."

raisedbynarcissists,fnoftpe,t3_g2pcvy,1587123698.0,"My dad and mom would do these.
My dad would have a bad day at work, and as he got in trouble (countless) sometimes and had to attend emotional intelligence seminars every time, to avoid it, he started to bring his anger home.

When he was angry, he would throw plates (full of food), the trash from the trash can, empty drawers, and just throw anything in sight.
He would black out. I would try to talk to him later and he wouldn’t remember it and he acted as if it were my fault.
But when that happened, he would yell at me to clean up my mess.
I got such a bad feeling anytime I had to clean ANYTHING from then out, and he kept doing it.

Anytime I cleaned I would get flashbacks to him acting like that and it would send me into such a state of anxiety, and me feeling as if I’m in the wrong (I wasn’t) that I would just sit there in the filth he created, and eventually, my mess layered his due to the anxiety from cleaning his up.
He never laid off and got better, only increasingly worse as the years went on.

I would have panic attacks so bad I would pass out from my breathing being so off, and he would yell at me for sleeping/crying when I should be cleaning up (his) mess.

I’m getting better at cleaning now that I’m out, but I still struggle occasionally. I do have a day set aside for cleaning every week, and I do clean as much as I can in that one day. Its worked well for me so far.

Some days the thoughts come back, however, and I just see him in my head, screaming at me about how horrible I am, and claiming his mess to be my own.

The amount of rage this man had is impossible to describe in a text. But these moments lasted about 10-15 minutes of him trashing/raiding things.
It felt like a life time, however.

He would scream, his entire body would turn red, his muscles would pulsate, and it honestly reminded me of a MMA or a Wrestling guy trying to seem tough, but then put that on the actions of a toddler, causing mayhem, with no memory of it later in life, lower comprehension/not caring/understanding.

When he wasn’t screaming insults at me, derogatory things, he would just scream ‘Aahhh’ at the top of his lungs the entire time.
He never did hit me, but he did push me a few times. One of the times I fell into a counter and got a black eye. Another time into a door frame and got, what I believe, to be an untreated concussion (I couldn’t ask him to take me to the doctor for that).

I remember I would be sick and the school would call him to come get me and he would always do that over me being sick, or having a period so heavy that I bled through all my supplies and couldn’t find anymore.
But the school loved him. He was a proud papa at the school.

The amount of trauma I have from just 10 minutes burst in life is too much and I feel badly for those who experience the same.
None of us deserve it."

Sometimes even the color on the abdomen can reach up all the way to the head.
Here is a green cheek conure mutation chart so you can see the red feathers are normal and not vet worthy: https://imgur.com/a/ul45TrO

With my bird experience (which is many rescues and some vet school): Most mutations are categorized into a few, normal, yellow sided, turquoise, pineapple, and moon cheak. Breeders and people more adverse in the mutation types (as opposed to just an exotic animal vet who knows the main ones) will likely be able to tell you what mutation any bird is.

The cutie photo above would be referred to as a ‘pineapple conure’- a mutation of the normal green cheek.

Mutations in green cheeks can be exaggerated or changed throughout generations by basically breeding for the desired result.
Mutations themselves are created by ‘error’ in pigmentation with a baby. Needless to say, these mutations have been around for quite some time and each is quite beautiful in its own way.

I have a normal and a pineapple.
My favorite mutation, however, is a ‘mist’.
