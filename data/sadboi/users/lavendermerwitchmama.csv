Typically though it's a couple days after I do it and see that they're already healing. The faster they heal, the sooner I'll want to do it again. But I try to not judge myself too harshly and remember that in the long run it's a good thing that I didn't go deeper.

I'm guessing that because you mentioned your mom, you're a minor. If you don't feel safe asking your parents for help finding a therapist, your school guidance counselor can probably help. If you are cutting really deep or feel like you're at risk for taking it too far, please get urgent help and get checked in somewhere. I'm so sorry for your loss.

Parenting,fqudppu,t3_gktv14,1589656999.0,"The father of my children was very much like this. We were together for 6 years, and he put me through the same thing through two pregnancies and babies. There was also verbal and emotional abuse, which is definitely what your boyfriend is doing to you too. It took me leaving. The kids and I were gone for 6 months. He finally hit rock bottom and saw how fucked up it was to treat us like that. After much convincing, and against the advice of my friends and family, I've given him a final chance but still refuse to live with him again. And tbh, though he's made a lot more effort in some ways, I often regret giving him another chance. When you're dealing with a narcissist (which I'd say you are) it takes them seeing and truly working on themselves and their empathy for anything to get better. If they can't be honest with themselves about their issues, there's no hope that they'll ever see you clearly enough to show the compassion and companionship that's required for a healthy relationship."

What I'm starting to notice about myself is that when I pick, I'm looking for some kind of sensory input that I'm not getting elsewhere. I've been trying out putting my hair up in a tight ponytail/bun, to the point where it creates a lasting tension on my scalp. While that isn't a long term solution, it can be useful if I just can't seem to keep my hands off. If I'm picking my face, I try to give myself healthy sensory input there too, like using a mask/peel that makes your face feel tight as it dries, and washing/exfoliating with hot water and rinsing with cold. I also know that I'm less likely to pick my face if I'm wearing makeup. If it's a whole-body issue, taking a hot shower and rinsing with cold, or doing some form of exercise that makes me work up a sweat also seems to help. If I sit still for too long, that's when the picking is the worst. You may be experiencing that too, having to work from home. Give yourself periodic breaks to do something active/healing.

BPD4BPD,fm832lk,t3_ftnqdb,1585841881.0,"I agree with your therapist, it sounds like you are punishing yourself in a way. New people in your life do not need to know this level of detail about your past upfront. While your intentions are obviously good on a surface level, it reminds me of some of my old behaviors from when my BPD symptoms were at their worst. 
I would purposely tell new/prospective friends/relationships some of my darkest parts. I told myself the same thing as you, that if I didn't it was like lying. But what I came to realize was that it was almost like I was challenging them in a way. ""Oh you care about me? Well did you know xyz fucked up thing about my past? How about now, still care about me?"" I realized that this was one way I was dealing with my abandonment issues. Kind of like, if you're going to leave me go ahead and do it early on, get it over with. The crazy part was that when I did this and people weren't as freaked out by my disclosure as I felt like they should be, I would just level up and keep telling them progressively worse things. Almost like I wanted them to leave, because I didn't deserve them in my life in the first place. And if they didn't hurt me by leaving, I'd just end up hurting them if they stayed. 

I see often the phrase ""I hate you, don't leave me,"" used to describe BPD. I think ""I hate myself, don't leave me"" also applies. 

Keep soul searching on this one OP. You don't owe people your story. And sabotaging potential new relationships won't heal the damaged ones from the past."

It's a way of looking at how you approach situations in your life. Similar to the concept of ""you can't pour from an empty cup."" Think of yourself first. Don't start doing things for others until your needs have been met. This isn't selfishness, it's self preservation. Which also happens to look (and eventually feel) a whole lot like self love. A really basic example is that in the morning before I get my kids out of their room, I always use the bathroom and brush my teeth first. Even if the toddler is screaming. It may take me 5 minutes longer to get in there and console him, but I tell you am a much better mom when I don't have to pee and I can't taste my morning breath. Other basic self care things like eating and sleeping and bathing enough are all forms of self love. You don't have to get that bubbly feeling in your chest when you look in the mirror before you can authentically love others. Self respect, self care, healthy boundaries...these are all forms of ""loving"" yourself."
