BeautyGuruChatter,fr3xv4c,t1_fr3xq2u,1589869404.0,Ok yall read into what someone writes I could care less about what she looks like I never said anything being wrong with her literal appearance. I'm saying how she PRESENTS as a person in the podcasts vs IN HER VIDEOS is different. They seem like two complete different people.
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3xp31,t1_fr3xnjp,1589869260.0,Can I personally message you because id love to talk to someone who doesn't roast me for having a simple opinion lmao on someone based on observations.
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3xbdm,t1_fr3wxgi,1589868942.0,Well.. I mean for someone who sells nail polish its a little sad that one can't pass it. I think anyone professionally in a certain field would feel the same way. I don't see why me expressing that is so terrible lol. It sounds like you just want me to agree that its ok. If she didn't do nail art why would I care if she passes it or not. She sells nailpolish who sells nailpolish but can't pass the exam for PAINTING nail polish on people. Yet uses the same tools in her videos... Just makes zero sense.
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3x0cb,t1_fr3wjvn,1589868684.0,Wait can you clarify your response? >_< sorry!
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3wyy0,t1_fr3wxgi,1589868652.0,Well I make it very clear I wanna know if others feel the same its pretty obvious if you like her I'm not gonna agree. I gave you my reasons.
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3wwx3,t1_fr3wjru,1589868604.0,I appreciate your honest and open feed back!! I agree with you in a lot of aspects!! I think she should of stuck with her nail art tho or like idk I dont have a problem with someone experimenting/making great videos it just bothers me on a level that she mocks it while doing it. Does this make sense? Making it like being a youtuber is not good yet she does do youtube... so when I see she sells products. The back of my head Im thinking is she doing that to make money or is this genuinely something she likes. I sometimes feel that way with Shane Dawson but he is different in another retrospect so its hard to say.
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3wp36,t1_fr3wjtk,1589868422.0,I'm not jealous of her lol and I wouldn't support her. For some reason you take me enjoying talking about my feelings based on observations as if I am envious of her.   I wouldn't trust someone who can't pass a simple nail tech exam. I enjoy her videos because their entertaining but to me I don't see her as someone I would trust on a professional level when it comes to nail art. And why that's a problem here is bizarre to me. I love watching nail artists on youtube and I would trust their opinion over hers any day. Nothing wrong with that.
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3wjwz,t1_fr3wehe,1589868300.0,"Ok, so me disliking her content is equivalent to me hating someone? I made it very clear I don't like her but I don't wish her ill. And yes I am critiquing her from a standpoint of a professional. Im not cursing about her, I am being polite and expressing that I don't like her for observations based on things she said. How me giving/asking others what they think is me hating then damn lol."
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3wfjj,t1_fr3wd0u,1589868200.0,"Ok, I used the wrong word, bf. my apolgies."
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3weem,t1_fr3wa50,1589868174.0,Yes and that's fine but its clearly evident you don't like that I don't like her. Others have commented and agreed. You don't have to respond. I am just providing facts as to why I don't like her. I'm not gonna agree with everyone as I see clearly she stands apart from professionals who do this 24/7. And I don't see anything wrong with that.
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3wb6p,t1_fr3w6w2,1589868100.0,"Thank you literally, people are getting so mad. Roasting my sentences in responses as if I'm knocking this woman off the planet. I don't know the age range commenting on this page. But I thought since this is a Beaty Guru Reddit forum people would agree lol. But it is ok if people don't but I literally find it weird that she yes criticizes others that's what I have a problem with. I totally get that and your right. Thank you!!"
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3w6ty,t1_fr3w58l,1589868000.0,"Lol, thanks  how hilarious listen if you don't like this post don't comment."
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3w3sw,t1_fr3vvry,1589867929.0,"Look for some reason people are taking this as I am hating on her for not having a license in nail tech. I don't care if she doesn't but when I watch other YouTubers you can see they take proper protocall and SHOW you how and the steps with using the right materials. I never see other Youtubers professionally whether they do this for fun or not have nails as yellow as Christine's. Anyone can do whatever they want and again Im not hating on her. I just think what sells is her entertainment and thats why people buy her stuff. And your right makeup, nails or hair is not a rocket science. But even myself I am an artist I do painting full time. Its a little a turn off watching someone act like being a nail artist or nail person is a joke to be a full time passion. I think because people like Christine and this observation I made makes them mad. But I saw it all the time in my line of work. People think its a joke anyone can make art. But not everyone can, its just uncomforting in my opinion to watch someone sell something their not 100% in. You get me?"
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3vvzm,t1_fr3vjph,1589867749.0,Lol owning a brand and knowing material to sell it well has a lot in common. If you know little about it how do you expect to sell a brand. She is profitable because she is flat out entertaining. Her entertainment is why it sells. Its like Shane Dawson his fans would probably die for him and feel like he could do no wrong and buy his merch even if it was his poop. Thats just how it is. No hate on Christine but thats just what it is.
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3vsnh,t1_fr3vqas,1589867672.0,I guess its incomprehensible because you dont like my opinion on a woman who can't pass a nail tech exam yet sells her own line of nail polish. Yes much incomprehensible.
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3vqha,t1_fr3vj5w,1589867622.0,You can't compare her to any beauty guru but since she sells her own nail polish line she starts falling into that category. I don't like her because as someone who is an artists and breathes it. Its just insulting to anyone who actually does this stuff professionally. You can do whatever you want and I got no issue with that. It just bothers me how she somewhat mocks what professionally people know/breathe do for a living and she calls somewhat a joke to use it as entertainment purposes. And thats fine if she prioritizes her day job over Youtube. But I still wouldn't buy products from someone who hardly knows much about something she starts selling as something many professional. Its just strange to me why people would buy a products from someone who only puts half into it when you could buy from someone who is passionate about it and knows everything because thats what they love.
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3vbx5,t1_fr3v5ux,1589867295.0,"Uh wow, you are totally not reading anything I write as I did not insinuate anything about someone who has a medical problem all I said was someone won't go to a doctor who has half credentials vs someone who has it all and is doing it full time. Would you get a boob job from someone who isn't full knowledgable in the area? Well, probably not unless one is dumb. And your contradicting everything nail techs know the ins and outs many YouTubers professionally know the information pertaining to nail techs whether their certified or not. You don't got to be certified but its CLEARLY OBVIOUS women in professional youtube videos doing nails know the protocall."
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3v4y7,t1_fr3uuz4,1589867141.0,"The difference is and my point I was making is that people who are passionate and put their whole body and soul into something are people I respect and trust more than someone who mocks a test/doesn't even know the protocall/does it for entertainment for themselves and puts it up to entertain you since lets be honest she is yes entertaining. I respect beautygurus who aren't certified MUAS because the difference is THAT is their life, they smell, breathe, eat, and are passionate. They study to know the things they need to sell products and find what YOU like as a customer. 

And watching Christine she either half the time doesn't know how to actually use something. Which she admitted to when I watched her take the nail tech exam. So that says a lot but people buy her nailpolish thats weird. 

And your taking my comparison to my field way to literally IM JUST SAYING nobody would go to someone who is in a field half ass and not aware of everything."
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3uw8r,t1_fr3ut1y,1589866945.0,"Lol ok well professionals also don't have yellow tainting on their nails and know the correct protocall. And your contradicting your message, exactly Nail techs go through traditional teachings to learn proper hygiene and biology more than actual art skill. But many actually Idk where your from but I live in NYC and many nail techs are AMAZING at nail art. So I disagree with that statement."
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3usgh,t1_fr3ueqo,1589866861.0,"Eh  I don't see someone who is genuine, I think her as a person on her husband's podcast vs entertaining are two different people. But this is based on watching and observing, plus reading others who don't like her. Do I find her entertaining 100% but I don't think she is showing you herself 100% no do I believe she is awkward, yes but many are and that's ok but I just think like anyone you don't really know them and neither do I or you. Only can go by observation."
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3ulw5,t1_fr3u2d0,1589866714.0,"Sally Hansen does only nail related work, there is a huge difference. Idk why your getting defensive. As someone like myself who is a full-time artist and art therapist I would be a little weirded out by someone doing therapy for ""fun"" but lacking credentials and not know much about it and being unethical by providing therapy without knowing the correct material in doing so. So even tho my example is the opposite of a nail tech it's the same concept. Yes Sally Hansen isn't a nail tech and that's fine but Sally Hansen doesn't do a different day job from making NAIL ART and is passionate about NAILS in general and does that PROFESSIONALLY. That's the difference, I just think its weird people are buying products from a woman who can't pass an exam and bashes on how not being a full-time Youtuber is beneath them in some sense and doesn't have extensive knowledge in nail work. That's like me going to a doctor who has half knowledge in the speciality he works in."
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3uatn,t1_fr3u3rl,1589866471.0,"Eh, as someone near her age she is somewhat fake, I don't agree. But thats ok that we see it differently. I get it being a running joke but its still odd to me how someone who has a running joke, can't pass a nail tech exam yet has her own nail collection. Thats just odd, I can't name an artist and even myself I am a full time painter I would never buy paint from someone who doesn't full time or knows the ins and outs. Its just a little contradicting in some of her being a youtuber yet making it a big deal how she has a full time job which mocks people who do that as an actual career being on youtube. No hate on her or anyone who likes her but I don't really see any value in her as a person or nail professional selling nail polish other then watching her for having a bad day or out of boredom."
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3tvs5,t1_fr3tokh,1589866136.0,"Sally Hansen and her are two different people lol at least Sally Hansen did that full time and was passionate about it. There's a difference between the 2 people Sally Hansen doesn't make entertainment videos and yeah it's pretty bad for someone who spends hours doing nail polish and she can't pass an exam on something she spends 2/3rds of her day doing besides her day job. So to me, she'd be someone I'd not want to buy a product from. It makes nail techs look stupid by her making a joke out of it. Because nail techs work hard as f\*\*\* to pass their own exam. Why would I buy nail products from someone who doesn't know anything about the ins of nail work. Christine has a nail polish line so its pretty sad.   


And having yellow nails I see NOT ON ANY other professional nail youtuber except Christine. Its pretty gross."
BeautyGuruChatter,fr3szzr,t1_f8lqb3x,1589865438.0,"OMG I AM SO HAPPY I FOUND THIS PAGE BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN THINKING the SAME THING, I do not like her or her husband they seem fake and have a weird relationship. They had on their podcast talk about how she refuses to marry because of patriarchal reasons and he was like ""If you did want to get married I would marry you."" And she is like ""So you do want to get married."" And he is like "" Oh no no no, I would of married you if it was something you wanted."" Idk their relationship and them overall is weird and they are very judgemental on people who have created tremendous success on their youtube careers."

jobs,fp68arx,t3_gb31v6,1588347876.0,"I'm going, to be honest with you, you should actively look whether there is a plague, virus, a squirrel who comes to your home to attack you for nuts or whatever reason. I know this sounds crazy and as myself who is currently unemployed, there are SOOO many people unemployed you are competing with people with your experience or more, people just out of school, people out of school early because of the virus, and people under your experience unemployed looking for a job, and people with absolutely no experience or relevancy to your field applying because they're so desperate for a job. That's a lot of competition and as Corona Virus dies down the more will jump on the job wagon. I recommend you try and be ahead of them I am doing that and have managed to get interviews. At least by the time, this is over I won't have to worry about finding a job while the stampede comes looking for one because of waiting it out. 

Also employers will be more adamant about taking anyone and anything because people who don't have experience applying will be more adamant and more likely agree to a low pay salary so then a company can cut corners compared to paying someone with a crap ton experience so consider that as well."
LifeAdvice,fp67ln4,t3_gbgnjv,1588347522.0,"You should feel happier that you reached a level in life where you can feel comfortable emotionally, mentally, money-wise, a career-wise than someone partying. Many people party and amount to nothing in life. Also partying does not make or benefit anything in one's life other than make you feel good in the moment short term. You are not missing out. I went to a party once for college kids and it was honestly the most boring immature observance I ever witnessed and I never looked back. Find parties for people in your age group. That's what I do if I ever want to party. But don't look at it as a part of life that is a tragedy I'd rather party hard at 30 with a well-paying job than party and be broke."
relationship_advice,fp44ibw,t1_fp44gaa,1588291521.0,I haven't either but there are people ive talked to thus far about personal stuff and often
LifeAdvice,fp3vcrq,t1_foy6n5f,1588286498.0,"Reading this has helped me so much saying as a lesbian has been very difficult and not only difficult but also tearing down my self esteem and my mental ability to enjoy getting to know a woman with feeling scared. I guess what I am having a problem is with how come I don’t get a lot of matches and when I do it never works out? A lot of the people I’ve talked to thus far trigger me and I’ll react not positively  because of how they are responding or because we’re spending so much time texting I can’t get an idea of the person which heightens my anxiety even more. 

With my ex she was my first long term relationship but we had a major age gap I was 23 when I met her and she was 46 and she knew how inexperienced I was and how slow I wanted to go because of the difference but she did whatever she could obviously to get with me to make her ego feel good. 

And I think that’s what hurts the most that I didn’t see the signs and because of that it affects me from being able to have a new relationship. My relationship ended 7-8 months ago. I thought if I met someone else I would forget all about her and be happy but I don’t feel happy. I feel like I’m not worthy, I’m not good enough, or lovable. 

How did you meet your gf and how did you utilize positive steps to help you? It’s hard for me not to focus on people who ghost or unmatched with me the worst is when I’ve had women tell me how amazing I am and how they want to take me out and then it’s over out of no where and I don’t understand why. I’m polite, understanding, and respectful. 

So your saying my need to please others is why I’m not finding the right person? Can you explain to me why I’m not being able to find the right woman?"
