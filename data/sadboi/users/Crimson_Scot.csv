PSMinecraft,fqn9rs0,t1_fqn8l7m,1589491080.0,Nah for once I actually like how the PS4 works. They have such a strict mob cap and how the chunks load. If you’re near something like a spammer and it keeps spawning and spawning. The game will jsut pretty much stop all other mobs and chunks outside of your area so it doesn’t lag tf out
