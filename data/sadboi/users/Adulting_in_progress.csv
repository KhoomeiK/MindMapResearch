It's tough what you are going through. If you need a friend to talk to, I will be around. Don't need to stay strong, instead, after we cry or when the mind is a bit clear, we can learn a bit how not to be too sad when our loved ones are in hardship. I usually do this by reminding myself sadness just make things worst for both of us, and I remind myself this repeatedly, and do some meditation training as a supplement.

Needless to say, it took a long time and a lot of hardship, but now I'm much better and ready for mamy different life challenges.

I find out that I must find out the main reason I have so much problem.

Further check reveal that I dont find meaningful life goal because I have stopped searching after a couple of disappointment.

So that means I have become lazy and gave up on finding out/trying to change my life for the better. 

It's not completely my mistake also, because I am also confused by the world, but the laziness IS my mistake.

Found meaningful life goals. Ask hundreds of questions, all got answered satisfactorily, trying hard to change.

Hi friend 👋🏻

First of all, you are in a tough condition. Congratulations on voicing things out.

Second, ""easy way out"" is never the answer. The correct answer if we dont want others such as our kids to suffer is to fight against our negativities.


First, analyze our strength and weaknesses,

Second, divide that weaknesses into smaller part,

Third, Prepare a plan to work on eliminating or reducing the negativites

Fourth, get professional help to do the 2nd or 3rd if you yourself hit a dead end or are lost

Fifth, profit for the rest of your life. You will lead a happy life because no matter what challenges life throw at you, you already have the experience of handling the most difficult thing --your own negativities--.

Also, the moment we are working on our negativities, I believe there will be changes to other around us. Those who are angry or demanding might still be the same, but those who try to care such as your husband will slowly be different.

Please try fixing yourself, if you want an extra support for trying, you may try to DM me.

For your happy life, and for your kids better future  too ^_^

It gets better when we work correctly toward it.

Work means effort.
Correct way is important.

If you can't have both, at least maintain effort while looking for the correct way.

Correct way for a fish is weird for the jellyfish, so not everyone can, should, or must help us. But if we keep maintaining effort to not be too down and to search for suitable help, then we will most possibly find the correct way, and can start getting better.

Notes:

1. The more we try to find the correct path, the more experience we got. These experience, if analyzed correctly give birth to wisdom.

2. The wiser we are, the easier other can help us, and so the easier it is to find suitable help.

3. If we give up searching however, the opposite become true and the harder it might be.

How does digital hug feel like though? I am curious.."

I also spend my birthday alone and cold with everyone forgetting my birthday including my family who were on a trip, but i see you had it worse.

Sorry to hear what you are going through. If you wanna call or vent to someone, i am available.

I am 24/M but not trying to have relationship so you can relax about that aspect haha 😄

Edit: I hope you can get better. Here, take a digital hug! 🤗"
depression,fbgb87f,t3_ed93sv,1576843420.0,"Well, if its too hard and uncomfortable and will just damage the mind, i dont suggest continuing. I mean a degree in engineering with a broken mind is not an equivalent exchange.

I myself left my uni in my LAST SEMESTER (law major, amazing parents allow even though they worry) but now I am much happier than I was. Sure still far from perfect, but if i was a -6 before, i am a 5/10 now 😄

Edit: spelling"
depression,fbd7yb1,t1_fbd7o6x,1576751458.0,"Yes. To make parents and sometime most friends understand is very very very difficult. They always think they understand when they just understand a small part of our condition, or they dont have time to understand the whole situation and help us.

So well, i got a lot of free time to listen. Anytime 🙂"

To find someone who could understand us is difficult, and eventually make us just want to give up. However, if you wish to try to share again, I am here to listen and reply.

depression,fbd6s5l,t3_ecr5vv,1576749718.0,"Mm.. i dont know if this will help but.. sometime having a lot of stuff doesnt equate happiness and sometime we have stuff but no time to enjoy them. So.. maybe set our priorities straight first.

Also if you are living in a slower paced country, you can try to use your free time for self/mind improvement, wholesome quality time with family, helping the poor or needy (volunteering sometimes).

Personal opinion. Hope it helps even a bit."

Worthy of success.

Hope you get the advice you need soon, and become more healthy both physically and mentally.

It is hard if we dont know the way, but it is easy when we finally understood the one thing that cause us to be so.

I myself used to have it, and for me the key is to find the answer about meaning of life since i was an elementary schooler up to when i am 20 years old. That is more than a decade of search.

I hope you can find out your cause and answers to it too. If you have any questions you can ask me, who knows maybe that decade can help a bit.

Feeling apathetic is not the most correct way, yet, to find a suitable way i need to know more about you, if you dont mind.

Or maybe wait for another comment that might be more helpful.

Anyway, great job for reaching out.

I know it is very very hard.

depression,fazhi7r,t3_eayahh,1576416129.0,"I surely cannot hear that internal scream, but i reply quite quickly. I also find it hard to keep a convo with text, so i prefer to call people, and let it flow. If we cant talk, just let it be, having someone on the other end while we work or study doesnt sounds too bad for me. And if we call, we can talk whenever we wanted.

After i got the answer, i will work on it because i dont want to feel negatives for the rest of my life, neither cause more sadness to those around.

I am not a professional, nor an ""experienced, wise man"", but i surely can help to listen and try to analyze problem objectively, to the extend that i am so objective people find me boring and i cant get friend easily. But well, in case like this it helps i guess.. 😌"

depression,faz1apf,t1_fayxihb,1576410183.0,"Food for thought bro.

For me, the best luck is meeting a suitable person that can teach/answer our questions instead.

Money can buy theraphy session, and entertainment for distraction, but in the end it boils down to our own mind.

Having someone who can teach us and answer our questions in a suitable manner so that we can train and have a calm, happy mind is much greater luck in my opinion.

Cheers 👊🏻"

Courage breeds effort. Effort breeds success. No matter how many time one with effort fall, he will stand again and move forward again, and in the end only success awaits.

No matter the luck one had, without effort it all goes to waste.

You are courageous, and i hope you will not feel down when you fall. If you need a friend for daily  motivation or discussion, here i am.

I hope luck comes your way too. A little luck never hurts 😁"
