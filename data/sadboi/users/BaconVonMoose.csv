I mean, he clearly has the capacity to be completely calm and deadpan when people around him are highly emotional. THAT'S not normal either. I have never once seen him get in a shouting match with another person, he always just has his blank condescending voice no matter how emotional the other person seems to be. I could be missing something but with the Shilo breakdown and the debates I've seen him on... When he's 'angry' he's just extra nasty, when he's sad he just says 'sad' things.

BPD,fbfrgaf,t1_fbfmey6,1576818523.0,"Good, and she probably is. Be ready to accept that she may not want to be friends but just know if that's the case you will find another friend and be happy again. But I wish you luck in reconnecting when you decide the time is right.  
You deserve to have friends, even if some bridges were burned, and you still will."
BPD,fbflatt,t1_fbfc3l1,1576813385.0,"There definitely is, you've taken a huge step already which is just being able to distance yourself from the intensity of those feelings a bit, and be able to be aware of it when it's happening instead of, as I'm sure you're all too familiar with, after it's too late and you've already unleashed a storm out in the open. Give yourself a big pat on the back for the progress you've made, because it's one of the hardest things to do. Even for people who don't have the disorder."
BPD,fbfl31a,t1_fbev5k3,1576813221.0,"I believe it was the better part of a year, like 10 months. I did send a general apology earlier than that which she appreciated (it was still at least a couple months after our last fight), but I didn't actively try to be friends again for several more months after.  
To be fair for context, I still to this day hold that I wasn't completely in the wrong either, I know why I hurt her, and I see that I expected too much out of her and that was stressful for her, but she had certainly done hurtful things too. But I needed to accept that she did apologize and there were some behaviors that weren't going to change and I had to either take them or leave them. The fact that she wouldn't change in my favor made me feel she wasn't really sorry so I held on to that resentment for longer. It's still something I have to talk myself down from constantly. I try to look at the positive aspects of any interaction we had instead of expecting more than what I got."
BPD,fbem18d,t3_ecx4ox,1576788699.0,"You and I must be the same person because that's what happened to me. I had a friendship I really cherished but I had a lot of resentment and she didn't understand why I was so upset and hurt and I thought I was justified and that was normal. Then once I realized it was BPD amplifying my emotions I tried to apologize and reconnect with her and it's just never been the same and I feel like I'm now fighting and struggling to get her to still want to be friends with me. She was also one of my favorite people and I don't want to make her feel bad again.

  
But, I suppose on the bright side things have slowly gotten better, sometimes she actually messages me on her own now, and she asked for my help with some things, and I hope that means she's starting to trust me again.

I hope your friend also starts to trust you again, sometimes it just takes a bit of time to see that your patterns really are different and that you really do understand."
HazbinHotel,f818d0n,t1_f810u06,1574155366.0,"Just for a little context to fill in your blanks here, she drew Shoe and Blaire White. Blaire White never did blackface, she took a picture while wearing a charcoal face mask, like for your skin, and people hate Blaire White because she is a moderate conservative transwoman and how dare a trans person not have the exact opinions and views they're supposed to have according to one particular group of people!!! So because they look for reasons to hate her they said she did blackface. Also Shoe is very liberal and I don't understand why these people are mad at her for drawing Shoe lmao"
goth,f40gw8p,t1_f3yta1z,1571297999.0,"I agree, I mean personally I would have loved 'just some chick with a piano' but I like a lot of things that most people aren't interested in. I think she's extremely talented, but yeah I was never into Evanescence in the slightest."
goth,f3yhpnr,t1_f3xu8p3,1571254172.0,"I agree that Evanescence isn't goth, but to be fair, I've heard her 'commercialization' was done intentionally by her record label, her original sound was a lot less 'mainstream' apparently but they said 'no one will wanna listen to just some chick and a piano' so they added the other elements that made it broader and more generic. Kind of sad, I think her music would be a lot better without it, but during that era being an indie artist was much harder to survive on so if you're being offered a boatload of money vs starving artist... eh.

Not ultimately the point of this but, conversationally interesting to me."
BPD,f2da0ph,t3_dctwt0,1570149178.0,"I've learned doing research on BPD and symptoms has helped SO much in allowing me to distance myself from them when they start up like that, like it's easily been the most useful thing. Just understanding what I'm doing and why made such a big difference in my ability to deal with it. You did an excellent job!"
BPD,f2342t2,t1_f22sy0f,1569905346.0,"Cool, let me know if that helps at all because the constant pain and tension is killing me. I kind of think it IS related to BPD because I notice I'm often very on edge and 'tense' and I do have a lot of trauma-based nightmares and I sometimes wonder if I'm just like, tensing in my sleep and that's why I wake up so sore? Worth pondering."
BPD,f22sq9n,t1_f22btqv,1569896134.0,Are they prescription? I've wanted muscle relaxers but didn't know how to obtain...
BPD,f22bp8o,t3_dbf3sz,1569886000.0,"Actually yes. You're the first person I've seen talk about this, but I feel horrible when I wake up. I ache and I can't keep my eyes open (because burning like you said) and I feel dizzy and disoriented, like it's really difficult, even if I've gotten adequate sleep. I don't know how great my mattress is but I'm pretty sure it's not terrible, it has a memory foam topper with lavender and stuff.

I also notice that if I go away for a weekend and I'm not in my regular life/routine it's actually fine. I travel and do conventions a lot, so this happens with some frequency and involves a variety of sleeping arrangements.

So yeah, I don't know if it's a mental health thing or something else or what but I feel so sore when I wake up I have to take ibuprofen immediately."
disenchantment,f19pt95,t3_d6qf5s,1569275793.0,"I'm really trying to enjoy this show but I just keep getting irritated with it. There's a lot of potential with the witch stuff and the madness stuff and Luci and all the demonic and prophecy threads, I am genuinely interested in it, feels like a conspiracy unraveling and that's what I like most about it. I do think more jokes land in Season 2 for me, I actually chuckled a few times and some of them were clever, only a few were SO eye-rolling that it got on my nerves...  
To me the biggest issue is the elves and how the show handles them to be honest. I've seen people say they like Elfo and all the elf stuff and I just don't get it, I HATE Elfo, he's the most annoying character I've seen in a long time. I know to some extent he's supposed to be but nothing about him is endearing to me and when he died I hoped he'd stay dead and be written out, though I knew he wouldn't.  
The entire premise of the elves is such a low hanging fruit joke in of itself, their names are intentionally lazy which makes me not take them seriously, and then they're supposed to be taken seriously by the plot? They're somehow convinced to exodus out to Dreamland and live in a ghetto where they get diseased by filth and suffer for no particular reason and then the show tries to make me feel bad for them? That was a dumb decision on their part, they didn't have to fuck themselves over like that. Yes yes I know about the symbol Leavo found and they're looking for something under the castle and all but that's not enough of a justification to me because there doesn't seem to be any reason the entire population needs to live there in order to find it? Or why they need to tolerate being relegated to the ghetto?

So many things in this show just seem to 'happen' for no particular reason and with none of the expected consequences and it makes me just really not care about what's going on because whatever is going on is just gunna be treated how the writing arbitrarily wants it to be so why should I worry about it? It makes the show extremely hard to engage with. The tonal contrast and the annoying characters and the stupid decisions just frustrate me."

todayilearned,ewhpdkn,t1_ewhof9n,1565416267.0,"1: Not for everyone, the amount you get decreases at certain income levels--income levels that are still not particularly HIGH and if you happen to live in a more expensive area doubly so.  
2: What about if you aren't lucky enough to have a family to mooch off when you're in college and you need to pay your bills by working multiple full time jobs and don't have time to also pile college on top of that?  
3: What if you have a kid in addition to the above?

milwaukee,ev6vak0,t1_ev2jk2n,1564251835.0,"Honestly you can draw perfect lines around neighborhoods in Milwaukee that are purely segregated. 'Only black people live here' 'only mexicans/latino here' 'only white people live here'

And there's further break downs of 'poor white people here, middle class here, rich people up there' and even 'middle class black people all live here specifically, the other black neighborhoods are poor'. Hell there's even an entire neighborhood of Jewish people and another of 50-60 year old white bikers.

I find it pretty jaw-droppingly segregated.

The downtown area is easily the most diverse and mixed together, don't let that fool you. Go a couple miles in any direction from downtown/ east side/ third ward and you'll see it.
