BPD,fq4hfh0,t3_ggg4pb,1589077794.0,This is an insanely toxic behavior. You shouldn't get bored of people that care about you. You shouldn't ghost them. I've been ghosted before and that shit hurts. Being abandoned made me want to kill myself and I wouldn't want that on another person. I don't know why a person with BPD would want to hurt others in this way.
SelfHarmScars,fpxhct3,t3_gg1tfs,1588982662.0,There are other forms of self harm that don't leave scars so I don't know what those people were on about. Your scars are valid and they show what you've been through. Don't listen to others and don't ever go deeper. It leads to a lot of regret. Stay safe.
BPD,fpu56wa,t3_gfk8ry,1588904909.0,I do it too. I imagine hella situations in my head.
BPD,fptzt4b,t1_fptzh05,1588901642.0,Exercise is perfect! My psychiatrist recommended me to exercise to release endorphins rather than self harm. Get fit friend!
BPD,fptzol2,t3_gfbfk1,1588901565.0,"I get it! When I was younger I'd become obsessed with characters out of shows and video games. To the point where it affected my life. If it's making you upset, try another game?"
BPD,fptzjh7,t3_gfbumy,1588901479.0,I understand it. My right arm is NASTY with scars. I've been looking for shirts with one sleeve lol. Long sleeve shirts arent doing me good. Imma try to exfoliate my arm daily now and put cream on it to try to make them turn white.
BPD,fptzcz6,t3_gfc1u6,1588901371.0,"Maybe inpatient can be an option for you? Only if there's a good treatment center in the area. They can also be hell. Besides that, please be completely honest with therapists and psychiatrists. You probably need more intense therapy and DBT"
BPD,fptz6gd,t3_gfdri4,1588901261.0,"You probably had really bad anxiety, like that terrible gut feeling that something was wrong even though it was okay. I've had it before with my best friend. He was fine and I was just anxious for no reason."
BPD,fptyzdu,t3_gfexwq,1588901142.0,I can't remember my childhood either. Maybe it's normal for us or those with depression in general? Depression does cause memory loss.
BPD,fptyvt1,t3_gffsdm,1588901082.0,"I self-diagnosed before I got an actual diagnosis. I fit every single symptom. Even the uncommon ones. If you feel like you have BPD, see a psychiatrist immediately. It's a dangerous illness."
BPD,fptyoz9,t3_gffxgc,1588900968.0,I was pretty manic last night so I drew and sang along to music until I got tired. Headbanging also helps lol (not banging your head against stuff but when listening to music)
BPD,fptyjsm,t3_gfg1nm,1588900882.0,"Totally! I've tried lots of different drugs and get high whenever it's available. I'm almost 21, so I'm pretty sure I'll be an alcoholic since I drink whenever I can anyways. It's better than cutting I think. It's obviously still bad for me though."
BPD,fptyerp,t3_gfggq8,1588900797.0,Yo an fp should only be someone you care about and especially has to care about you. You deserve someone better to give love and feelings to.
BPD,fpty89f,t3_gfi5zg,1588900687.0,"Be careful. If he's known to be flaky, I wouldn't trust him as your FP. That should be designated to someone who truly cares about you and won't bounce at the drop of a hat. Family issues is understandable, but dropping out of your life completely for months is not okay imo without a prior warning."
BPD,fptxt9j,t1_fpsxhye,1588900438.0,I'm surprised it's become a trend. It's not as well known as anxiety and depression. Do people not know how hard BPD is to have? It's a living hell for me.
SuicideWatch,fn87cdd,t1_fn86yb8,1586735457.0,"No thanks. I've tried for weeks and it's just been building up. I've tried prayer and witchcraft to make me happier, but nothing replaces what I've lost."

SuicideWatch,fjc2vwh,t1_fjc2cei,1583207219.0,"Haha I wish that was the case for me. Unfortunately I never will feel the same love for another person. I know myself. Thus, I will never feel that happiness again. I've been depressed since I was a child, so nothing will change for me."
SuicideWatch,fjc1p1i,t1_fjc0jce,1583206365.0,"Nothing is fun to me anymore. I used to play a lot of video games, but I can't anymore. The only thing that brings me joy is being with the person I care about the most. But my happiness is not meant to be."
SuicideWatch,fjbyx6a,t1_fjbya8g,1583204517.0,Nah. The only person I've ever cared about consistently rejects me except physically. I can never love again. It's just not possible for me. And marrying someone was my only goal in life. To be happy.

SuicideWatch,fhd236k,t1_fhd1onl,1581475657.0,"I made the same mistake. Don't be like me. Just live on with your life. Cherish those you care about. Even if you think they don't love you, they probably do."
SuicideWatch,fhd1xlg,t3_f2co58,1581475565.0,"I understand how you feel. I lost someone too and I crave the end. But if you love your family, your friends, then live for them. It's something I can't do, but you should."
SuicideWatch,fhd1jio,t3_f2hvew,1581475334.0,"I have BPD too. I get how it feels. But you love your family, and that means something. Live for them and cherish the moments you spend with them."
SuicideWatch,fhd1em6,t3_f2ivgd,1581475252.0,"When I was 13, I was severely depressed too. It's existed since I was 8. Age doesn't matter to depression and it affects us differently. Reach out to a counselor or somebody you trust. It'll feel better, I promise."
SuicideWatch,fhd18m7,t3_f2j2ay,1581475155.0,"I get it, I really do. Just find outlets for your anger. Maybe medication will help? It did for my anger management."
SuicideWatch,fhd12d5,t3_f2jrvd,1581475052.0,I understand how you feel. I did the same thing and lost the person I love most. At least live for him if your existence brings joy to others.
SuicideWatch,fhd0wf9,t3_f2jtio,1581474953.0,"I hear you and understand how you feel. I got ghosted by my two best friends from high school. After that, I made several attempts because I had no one. But after just barely existing for a year, new people came to me and wanted to be my friend. Happiness can always be found eventually. Maybe not for me, but it definitely can for you."

depression,fg2bf8h,t1_fg26b2a,1580441875.0,It took me 19 years to find it and my happiness abandoned me. Just like everyone else. I have no friends. No family that truly cares about me.
selfharm,fg1y1c9,t3_ewghgi,1580434927.0,It's a ratio of needing someone to notice and help and just mental illness. Try talking to someone so you can get clean. You don't want more scars.
truscum,ffudmzv,t1_ffucl9e,1580239754.0,"I haven't heard any scientific proof showing the existence of nb people. Obviously some have chest dysphoria, but if you called yourself an enby queerfuck like the person I saw did, I don't think you don't have dysphoria."

truscum,ffqf2mr,t3_euln54,1580132688.0,It's all about inclusivity. Pretty gross and inappropriate to include fetishists imo. They should stay in the crossdressing sub.

selfharm,ffp5pxf,t3_eug8kf,1580086907.0,Keep away from that. Youve already got a year down. Concern yourself with hobbies and other stress relief. Try meditation or punching a pillow. Anything to help relieve the stress.
selfharm,ffp5mu5,t3_eug8va,1580086846.0,"Try to not self harm again. Don't mention it if it'll cause unneeded stress on him. Just try to keep your promise. It's okay to relapse, but you need to keep strong."
selfharm,ffp5g5z,t3_eu8e2p,1580086712.0,"EDs are a form of self harm. For me, the body dysmorphia started when I was 10. I self harmed as a kid though as a result of emotional abuse. It's all self hate for me lol"
selfharm,ffp5bl5,t3_eu95u0,1580086574.0,Be sure to never go too hard. You don't deserve the trouble of countless scars.
selfharm,ffp5849,t3_eu9ci5,1580086504.0,Bruh I get triggered by someone using the wrong tone of voice. I feel like a dummy.
selfharm,ffp553h,t3_eu9dso,1580086443.0,"Please try to find another outlet to relieve stress. Meditation can help or punching a pillow could as well. For some people it's exercise. For others, it's scream-singing songs in their car."
selfharm,ffp51if,t3_eu9qox,1580086374.0,"Jackets all the way. If I'm wearing a short sleeve shirt and wanna be fashionable, I wear a mesh longsleeve top underneath. It mostly conceals the scars. You could also try makeup as well."

selfharm,ffp4v0e,t3_eubkih,1580086248.0,"I get it completely. You just need to find another outlet to reduce stress and make yourself feel better. Punch a pillow, my dude. Go ham on it."

selfharm,ffp4eww,t3_euf6zp,1580085971.0,It's better that you didn't hit fat. It can be dangerous and maybe it's your own way of telling yourself that it's not meant to be.
selfharm,ffjyhx9,t3_eu1kng,1580010449.0,"I have the same experience. People only seem to care when my life is on the line, not when I'm feeling so bad inside. Don't seek validation through self harm. It'll start a deep addiction. You don't want to get into that. You've already started a road to recovery by letting people know. Stay clean, friend."
selfharm,ffjy7fu,t3_eu0o2g,1580010221.0,Definitely try it out if you're interested. Schools are lenient when it comes to institutionalization in my friends experience. Be sure to do research and go to a good one though lol
selfharm,ffjy3fb,t3_eu0qck,1580010133.0,"Be sure to tell him how you feel. How you truly care for him and don't want to lose him. He needs help right now and if he can't get therapy, he needs at least one person to be there for him."

selfharm,ffjxs2b,t3_ety9fx,1580009882.0,I understand how you feel. But there's always a reason to be alive. For the people that love you now or that will in the future. The point of life is to try to live a life of happiness. We're just the kind of people that have to work for it.
selfharm,ffjxn2m,t1_ffjx5s7,1580009772.0,I understand. I feel the same thing. I went to the hospital earlier this week for a really deep one and now I'm considering it again. But I won't do it. Because I need to be clean for the people I love. To be able to wear short clothes in the summer. Try to take your mind off of it. That's why I'm on Reddit right now.
selfharm,ffjxi5l,t3_etyeeb,1580009664.0,Please try to go for days at a time without self harming. It's an addiction and takes time to get clean. Please don't go deeper. It can mess with the functionality of limbs and things like that. At least talk to someone to help you begin the process of recovery.
selfharm,ffjxbx3,t3_etygy0,1580009526.0,"That's how it is for a lot of people. When I was a kid, I'd hit my head a lot. For me, it's just a symptom of BPD."
selfharm,ffjx7x9,t3_etzj0p,1580009438.0,You got two days clean. That's great! You can definitely go longer. You just have to try your best! Relapsing is a normal part of recovery.

selfharm,ffjx0qz,t3_etzmx2,1580009279.0,Moisturize and massage. It really helps if they're raised. Try out different scar creams if they're dark or even lemon juice.
selfharm,ffjwxla,t3_etzqnv,1580009209.0,"I had the same experience at an OBGYN. It's really uncomfortable, so I felt an immense desire to get clean so I wouldn't have to feel like that again."
selfharm,ffjwuib,t3_etzu4q,1580009142.0,"Glad you feel a bit better about your situation. Telling someone is the first step to getting clean imo. I know it's addicting, but you needed to stop at some point, so why not try now if just for the sake of your friend?"
selfharm,ffjwpyd,t3_etzzi0,1580009037.0,"Hey, I feel you. My whole right arm is perma-fucked now. Please don't add to your stress by self harming. It can be relieving in the moment, but the scars just cause more trouble."
selfharm,ffjwmn4,t3_eu08ji,1580008963.0,"I would talk about how your experience made you feel. Self harm is a difficult subject, but I'm sure you can bring your point across. Advise your friend not to get started because it can get addicting and the scars can sometimes last forever."

BPD,ffjpdua,t1_ffjotv1,1580003613.0,Lmao you're not ugly. You're way above average and those people were cruel to you. You just have some trauma and issues you need to work through. I understand how it feels. I have severe body dysmorphia. Please just focus on getting better. You'll feel way better about yourself if you work on your mental state.
BPD,ffjo76b,t1_ffjncw7,1580002815.0,"Please don't hate yourself. You're beautiful, truly, and you shouldn't look to something like surgery to make you feel better.

BPD,ffjnn8s,t3_etvod4,1580002442.0,Oof this is exactly why I've tried to commit suicide so much. Because of the idea that my fp would be a lot happier without me in his life. It just makes him angry when I say that though.
BPD,ffjnh82,t3_etvt2a,1580002327.0,I've heard of socially anxious people doing this. I do it a lot too because I don't want to seem clingy. Sometimes I actually do forget to text back though lol
BPD,ffjncq9,t3_etvzl4,1580002242.0,"Yeah I feel like I dissociate to a small extent all the time. I think that's why I can't remember a lot of what I do. If I'm with my fp though, I'm in awake mode and I try to cherish the time I spend with him."
BPD,ffjn83k,t1_ffjmmxm,1580002154.0,"Have you been diagnosed with body dysmorphia? If you really think you're that ugly, the trauma of being used and bullied may have affected you to that extent. There's nothing you need to fix. You look pretty."

BPD,ffjmnhk,t3_etxjqu,1580001767.0,I dated my fp on and off for a year. We're still really close. He doesn't want to get back with me because of my BPD and all the BS I put him through. Tons of suicide attempts and meltdowns ruin relationships.
BPD,ffjmisu,t3_etyoxc,1580001678.0,"For me, I checked off all the symptoms of BPD in the DSM-5. I was really quickly diagnosed because I knew exactly what my issue was. If you let the doctors know your issues and it aligned with the diagnosis, then you probably have BPD. I'd get a second opinion though if you're unsure."
BPD,ffjmctt,t3_etyxdi,1580001571.0,You have nothing you need to change about yourself except for your confidence. You're super good looking and those kids picked on you because of their own insecurities. I had the same issue growing up and now I hate photos and can barely look at myself in a mirror. Don't be like me. You're beautiful.
BPD,ffjm2wt,t3_etz77a,1580001383.0,I rarely ever get angry. Just sad. Just be glad you know where he's going and what he's doing. He lets you know what he's up to because he cares for you and how you feel. Maybe take the alone time to do something fun by yourself? See your own friends or do a hobby.

BPD,ffjlhs8,t3_etzigg,1580000987.0,I get it. It makes people wary around me and I hate that. It's a difficult and painful disorder. Even the smallest criticism or tone of voice can turn me into a spiral. But I still wouldn't want people to be walking on eggshells talking to me.
BPD,ffjlc3b,t3_etptdr,1580000876.0,"Tbh love from others doesn't matter to me because I don't really care about anyone other than my fp. It's selfish, but I can't control how I care about people.
