Anxiety,fcw1zq7,t3_ej29di,1578015296.0,"I feel this. I lost my previous job due to my anxiety and depression a few years ago and have been unemployed since then. Tbh I kinda like being able to spend my time how ever I want, except for my obviously very limited finances. I know I'll have to go find a job at some point, if only for the money, but I just hate the thought of spending so many hours every week doing something I don't really want to do, and spending my life time, which is definitely valuable to me, working for somebody who doesn't appreciate it."
Anxiety,fcnzvj1,t3_ei4t1h,1577821563.0,"Happy New Year!

I'm already full of plans on how to improve my life in the new year - just not very certain on how I can actually stick to them for more than a couple days..
And I've got a bit of the FOMO right now for being sick and staying at home instead of celebrating."

The additional home spawns I got from the changes still seem to be there, too. It's too late here to go outside now, but I'll definitely have to check my area tomorrow to see what has changed. Looks good so far, though."

While, after roughly one year, I still haven't really managed to connect to any of them beyond the game (not actually living in town doesn't help there), I'm mostly comfortable playing together with these people. PoGo has become some sort of 'safe zone' for me. Not too long ago I managed to randomly approach one of them to ask for help with a t4 Raid (Still looking for that shiny Alolan Marowak) - something I'd never do without the game."
