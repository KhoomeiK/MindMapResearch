fragrance,fpcvfuv,t1_fpctu1n,1588513763.0,"YSL L’Homme aka Lil Homie is an absolutely beautiful scent.

fragrance,fo77qt6,t1_fo66sxs,1587573699.0,I own Sauvage and Carbon and I love both of them. Sauvage has godlike performance. Carbon smells more refined and more soapy but has average performance. I don’t know how 2015 Sauvage batches differ from modern day batches of Sauvage but I don’t find the opening screechy and I don’t find it to smell like a chemical mess. I don’t know about others but I love both of them equally.
fragrance,fo49jb5,t1_fo3121e,1587500520.0,I gave up on fragrancenet after one order with them it took them two weeks to confirm an order last February. FragranceX is great and Giftexpress is a very underrated site.

Carbon is a more refined version of Sauvage to me. Think the shower gel vibe of Sauvage mixed with lavender and soapyness that Prada is known for. Performance is good for me not great, lasts around 6 hours for me. I’ve gotten compliments wearing both of these if that matters to you lol"
