GirlGamers,fr2ieli,t1_fr1paau,1589837828.0,"I think many young women have found power over men in their sexuality (as well as made some $$.)  If that is what you really, really want to do as ""revenge"" you can.  Just remember the internet is forever.  Once you put out racy or explicit pics it will be everywhere someone can facially recognize your face or your marks on your body.  So ffw 40 years from now and you want to be a Senator.  Or maybe your future kid is fooling around on PornHub and there you are.

I absolutely know that every guy I roleplayed and ERP'd with was masturbating to it. Usually RIGHT at that moment or maybe later (sadly with the wives - ugh)   That is guys.  Just the merest suggestion you might describe a BJ in text is enough to get them to dish over whatever you think you want..

The end game is - you are objectifying yourself via RP or ERP or doing cams.  Any woman who sexualizes herself it making herself an object to the average male gaze and accepting the power and the problems of that act intimately.  At some point it becomes exhausting as a top or as a performer because they don't care about you personally, your problems, or your need for a relationship and friends.  They just want fap fodder.  

So if they want it - make them pay for it, you just have to accept that online there are consequences and you may loose your anonymity or personal privacy."
GirlGamers,fr2hjha,t1_fr23hu4,1589837392.0,"I think guys would do all that crap by themselves as the culture of their friends groups dictated.  However, if we were in a mixed group you didn't pull that BS in the 90s.  My ""team"" was my church youth group and we played competitive sports against other teens in mixed gender groups.  No one would have ever said a swear nonetheless a racial or sexual slur.

The rest of the world was  having a drastically different experience.  Around the time I was 16-17 I started helping out in the Headstart room with the 3-5 year olds and I started hearing them repeat lines from ""Beavis and Butthead"" and ""Ren and Stimpy"" - plus all the new adult animation from Nickelodeon and MTV.  I also noticed my tiny charges were watching rated R movies like Chucky and all that.  It changed their expression of language and desensitized them to more adult content.  And this trend has grown and grown kids being exposed to adult content and no one sitting down and offering context or even connecting that TV IS NOT REALITY (same for Porn)  

I don't think it was better w/o the internet.  Kids just had a little more reserve for each other, probably because we were face to face.  Now they can see stuff, have no one but invisible peers to work it out with in an echo chamber, and ADULTS mixing in with these kids pretending to be kids to exploits them, troll them, and lead them to unpleasant places.  

If I had a kid right now - I'd have every stupid surveillance tool on until they were 16 (and maybe older if they are a wild kid.)"

It is good to remember Sacramento is the distance between Kansas and Dallas roughly.  It is a 10-14 hour drive from Sacramento to LA. So if your support system is there, get stable, stick around there.

You can take a drive, bus ride, or train ride (because Sacramento has a straight shot into LA on Amtrak) to LA, walk around, drive around, and get into the ugly areas.  Envison your life there.  See how safe you feel just walking the regular streets. 

Because it is a nasty, harsh place despite the pretty weather.  It is all about $$$$$ and people will never say ""F-you"" to your face, but they will happily toss you in a ditch smiling away.  If you don't have a job, house, and support system waiting, like I said, those that are in wait for you as prey, will come for you and seem really nice and helpful.  

Reality also - LA County has been TREMENDOUSLY hit hard by Covid.  From the map, my old home county of Riverside (which is five times larger than LA county if not more for landmass) had less deaths by far than that tiny raidus.  People are sick there just as much as it is in New York.  

Hang out in Sacramento.  Visit the redwoods.  The weather is nice there.  And wait to move to LA till this shit has blown over and you have a place or job waiting.

Outdoor and Environmental Education camp is mandatory for all Cali students for 3-6 days at an away-from-home camp.  It is how I got my start.  I got a good wage, place to live, and the money saved up fast since we didn't leave the mountain except once every two weeks or so.   ONCE Covid calms down and they reopen it is a great job.  (I also worked with several actors in this job.  One was Carlo's Mencia's brother who was a exotic dancer, one is an actor who Ive seen in videos and usually ends up playing a trans bodybuilder in comedies since the 1990s (because they are) one of them is a great character actor - not big at all - but I see him in everything from Pirates of the Caribbean to Guardians of the Galaxy (he was the guy in the control booth they hijack in the first movie)

Living in Van:  Everything sucks about living in a car unless you are a multimillionaire on a gap year in a tricked out VW or Mercedes camping van.

3. Organize and stop pugging groups.  I know some games mostly function on random teams or random events, but your life will be much happier with a set group.
4. Report - if you don't like what you hear/see REPORT THEM.  After years older gamers like myself semi-normalized the micro-aggressions and the traumas of dealing with jerks (of all genders)  - WELP we don't have to.  And most gaming companies are concerned.

6. Report to law enforcement (federal, state, and local) - if you feel you've been doxxed or threatened - your personal data shared or breached - make a report to your local law enforcement.  

You need to scream - scream for change from the people who want it and don't want their game's image sullied.  And if you see friends experiencing microaggressions or aggressions or being doxxed - tell them to do the same and help them. 

Up until the 2000s I've lived in a gaming utopia where young men  didn't say foul things in public groups and behaved decently well outside of a few creepy people.  That was in FFXI, Age of Conan, LOTR, Aeon,  City of Heroes, Neverwinter,  Elder Scrolls, SWTOR, Star Wars Galaxies, and WoW overall.   I'm still not sure why young males born passed that date grew so incredible naïve and stupid about how games work and who games are played by.

Previous to 2000 woman played video games.  Previous to 1999 women played video games.  and 1980-1990s women most entirely and freely played video games with pretty much the idea of sexually harassing a woman in IRC chat or on the usenet  or in a pro-MP game was nearly unheard of publicly.   And there was no community to support the delusion or foul behavior.

There are a ton of (jerk) well-meaning capitalists who bought up a ton of properties in the last six years who are managing remotely and are basically trying to cash in on the trendy new cute city centers or vintage housing.  Many are aspiring slum lords.  And you'll find plenty using proxies to be their slum-managers.

So check for roaches - check for BEDBUGS - and check your heating/cooling arrangements.  Many homes here are wrecked and you can't tell (esp bedbugs!!! so bad here.)  As well older houses aren't designed for proper insulation so unless they/ve been updated, you'll find yourself really hot in summer and freezing in the winter.

To find people to rent from - ask around with REAL people where you want to live.  They'll send you to PEOPLE.  Websites are ok, but #1 location for scammers.  Don't prepay for anything.  Always read the lease.  And make sure your doggie deposit rules are STRONGLY clear.   And just make sure you know how you need to get from your house to your work.

This is why morale is HUGE. If people don't see the guild leader protects them, helps them, and makes choices by the logs vs crap data they feel secure and they stay with you through 50-100 wipes. 

No one wants to do anything for a dick raid leader or team members who'd rather spend more time talking shit than raiding."
CompetitiveWoW,fqun3o3,t1_fqu72fx,1589661534.0,"Lets see - the guilds been going since TBC and we can get through Heroic in less than two hours.

By not rushing we didn't run out of gameplay and we could teach the newer players after we got AOTCs.  We have every AOTC since Legion (when I joined) and got them well before the carries.  

My Mythic guild was #9 on the server.  I was #11 for  heals and my co-heals was 1# and competitive in arenas. 

I've been in since vanilla. 100k HKS. 

My whole point though is bad behavior makes bad raid teams. You will NEVER see Method or Limit or whatever pulling this garbage BS.

And unless you one of the top four guilds in WoW the idea of WoW being competitive on a server/shard basis is laughable.  If you get the World First whatever - that is pretty cool, but it means nothing on the competitive rosters.   Zippo.

So why not have fun with cool people and grow together as a team instead of making people feel like shit for gaming and paying for a game you hate and playing with people you hate? 

People pay 15$ plus for whatever cheating they do to be yelled at by a 17 year old in the foulest language ever to do things that make the game worst plus come out feeling anxious, scared, afraid, and inadequate.  They are sad, angry, tired, and frustrated.  And they pay for this type of raiding with the illusion it means SOMETHINGs.

It all means nothing.  Sound and Fury, just pixels, and the only power any Guild Leader has is over their team who cedes power unto them and who aren't going to stick around for abuse.  

So the team suffers and all that is left is time wasting garbage who make the game miserable for every happy player who enjoys WoW for whatever reason they do.

Most importantly - you can't spend 5-20 minutes between pulls talking trash.  If you want ""fame"" you have put that ways of children behind you and start using all those vital business management and team building skills to make it work.

You see there are guilds right now still struggling mid Normal Ny.  They don't read the spreadsheets offered by do many of the big players.  They don't watch videos of how other raids do it.  They don't work on maximizing their builds and what is worse they don't adapt their play space to their play style.  They don't coordinate with their team members and don't understand what each class brings to the table and what EXACTLY they need to do outside of their role.  And they don't use logs to base their strategies - they just randomly assume by ""watching"" who is doing what or not.

Finally, Gear: I'm sorry but you don't get Cutting Edge on a laptop with crappy internet except the few that love a limited range of vision and a non-responsive keyboard. So you are looking for a team ready to use ALL the tools, obviously have skill, or you have the skill to make them quickly better.

Sounds like a tall order - but reinforcing tough rules can be tough, but ultimately you get done in a few hours what takes others 5.  You also can have diverse people in your guild, people with kids, and people who are professionals who want a respectful place to play vs a bunch of jerks who flake off and waste your time.

They way to stop that is stop the mechanics.  In the same way to stop spammers is to stop the mechanics allowing them to spam and cheat.

Recently an article on wohead was released that they're going to make the slash follow command no longer function except very limited. People will not be able to have characters follow them or multi box anymore with a follow command.

People will not be able to follow a multi box in PvP zones or flagged.

You could follow this up with a clear report button function for everybody on the server to know they can report spammers.

Chat keyword filters to stop spammers from spamming with autobans on repeated keywords or symbols

Coolers or lobby areas where banned or susoect characters remain and have no access to the open world after a series of repeated behaviors are sensed.  You cant leave till your id is verified.  

I think China does play per minute still? Require every player to have an ID verified Battle.net account and require an authenticator for all logins.

Remove all trial account access from the main world.

Remove all speech/chat functions untill level 20 (unless guilded maybe)

Required relogs every 1-2 hours for every character.

Finally, any account that has proof it was tempered with, made or leveled against the rules, outright bought account, used for expolits or exploitative farming may NOT compete in an ESports competitions.

If you cheat you should be instabanned from Esports. 

if anything will drive home that message that cheating won't get you ahead in WoW and off into the finals, that would do it.

Go back to the last Cutting Edge and do a little data mining then start invalidating their wins on N'zoth.

GMs also need to cruise the world more. When a report comes in about a crime in progress, let the teleport in and see it first thing. Back in the EQ and NWN days you literally had a ban-stick which you targeted a character and goodbye Charlie.  There is also a player jail Gms can send people to.

Then we met after and she showed me the form  they have to use to apply setting up this tech stuff and asked if I could help her fill it out.  So, sure, I can fill in the technical data, but I am sure as hell not completing that form entirely.  I feel like they are setting me up to do a bunch of their work and then they'll take the credit.  I feel that creeping bully/exploiter energy I tend to attract because I'm smarter than other people, but not as charismatic, and I want to help to get people to like me.

I'm clinging to the idea that once the main focus of my work opens up again I will not have time to help them with anything and I will distance myself from the entire project.

They ironed their clothes with starch.  They ironed the sheets before they went on the bed.  They did full spring and fall cleanings.  They polished their floors to a high shine and you could eat off those toilets.  They wore steel-boned girdles and cantilever bras AND did all those crazy cleaning, washing, and pressing.

AskWomen,fq9tffk,t3_ghhleu,1589206683.0,"My main advice is to think very hard before you make choices for your future.   People are always rushing young people into courses of action or giving them incentives to do things based on ""youll make a bunch of money"" or worse ""this might not be what you want but it is SO MUCH easier!""

Relationships:  Like it or not, you are ""jail bait"" to many and thusly need to read into every favor, offer to get together with you, and examine ANY attempts to get you alone in a private place for a date or meet up.  Don't date anyone ten years older than you until you are 18 for your own sanity.   You can have fun - but if you loudly identify as an unaccompanied minor, legally or not, you are going to attract the worst of humanity who study how to exploit a young woman in need. 

Work/School:  Finish your schooling.  Doesn't matter if you are in advanced classes or regular - just finish it somehow.  Most areas now let junior/senior students attend community college or trade college for the bulk of their last two years (USA-wise)  so if you are sick of high school, finish it in junior college and get your AA two years early.  Then you can transfer into a 4 year as soon as you are ready as a junior.   College is drastically different than high school and it can get you a place to live, people to uplift you, and to move up in this world.  Military service is also a great door to this - you can get free medical or technical training and have a career for life. 

Body/Health:  This is a meme/joke  - but use sunscreen and don't get all weird about tanning.  In 40 years you don't want to look like a leather handbag, though.   Get a good book like ""Our Bodies, Ourselves"" from the Boston Woman's Health Collective.  It is the bible of female/women's health.  Read it all - soak it in.    

Period Stuff:  You are not trapped using disposable pads and tampons and spending 25$ a month on pads.  Try out the THINX period panties that are washable or even a menstrual cup.  As a person on your own you can spent 15$ on a cup that will last you five years vs 25$ a month on garbage pads that hardly work.

Take it slow.  Don't rush.  ASK FOR HELP!  And make sure you have some adult allies in your community who you identify with in a formal group.  Find a group and use that for your support system if you haven't got a family,  not just a random bunch of teenagers and 20s who know just as much as you do but pretend they know everything."

It is really important to look at these BECAUSE they absolutely have been designed for any person of any political persuasion to find a role with them working toward conservation in the manner they decide is best. 

Plus 16-24 would be my choice.  This is the window when it is exceptionally expensive to live as a young person on your own.  At 24 a young person is considered an adult and their parent's income and insurance no longer count for them.

If you focus your mind on a goal, learn everything you can about it, and look for those opportunities you'll start to see potential relationships.  It is all about intention and training your brain to be more aware of connections you might have ignored in the past.

You also can question some other things.  We live in a time where being asexual or celibate is  lifestyle choice as much as some say we are born this way.  Mainstream society has always emphasized to be complete you NEED a person in your life, but some people don't care about sexual intimacy and some people don't care about personal intimacy.  And that is ok.  

I have dated people in your situation before and I can say the hardest thing for me is the lack of experience they have in the process of having a relationship.  I felt there was a ton of physical distancing because they didn't know how to access the progressive move towards physical touching and intimacy.  

I also found that porn (for many) over a span of over 20 years develops some VERY unrealistic expectations for both the (women in this case) they THINK will  be attracted to them, real human bodies, and how real physical and sexual intimacy happens in the real world.  Plus too much fantasy and too much self-pleasure actual can result in real life sexual dysfunction for several documented medical reasons you can easily google.  

That aside - the human  mind is a wonderful thing and it can learn new things easily if you push it.  At 40 we have a harder time breaking out of our comfy routines, but we can learn through inevitable trial and error.

There is no problem with letting them get reacquainted through a crack in the door and having them in separate rooms for a few weeks.  Just start over.  Rub them well with smells.  Feel them through the door next to each other.  Play with toys next to each other.

We'd had this long discussion a week before about why we'd not being doing this as a guild with people telling me I was wrong to suggest it.  

I got REALLY mad.  It just started out with typing ""SO you randomly did the thing the guild leaders said we would not do and one of the exact people that said no WAS IN THAT MYTHIC RAID?""   and  then I cited some of our guild guidelines, then after that I just said I was disappointed it was not a scheduled event (because we run on schedules due to people having families and kids) and that they should not have posted it in our chat and their logs in our official raid channel if it wasn't official.  

It was a dick move - I think I was even online on an alt while the whispering was going on to form the raid,  and I was angry for me, but I was angry for my other friends who'd also wanted to do this together. 

I keep asking myself ""Why can't I be angry?"" and ""Am I being angry for people who feel less empowered to speak their anger?""   I paid my dues in the guild and we have a ton of new people coming in who just don't understand the type of rules the leadership put in place about both us doing new content together, but scheduling it was TOP PRIORITY.  

And they think that is drama?  And I am being difficult after years of getting stepped on and endless microagressions that build up? It is the little things that kill, man. 

(I've done other stupid things like call out my sister's ""I love my BF"" picture because he had tried to choke her to death the week before.  I threw a tantrum on a listserv when my much older BF cheated on me, even though I kinda knew he was in a poly family, but was a dumb ass .  I sent out a group email to all the parents at the daycare I worked at because I thought had Whooping Cough and I wanted to warn them to get tested.  And my ""direct emails were constantly misread by my old boss as angry or rude to the point where she misread one, tried to fire me, and I took her to court because her misreading my voice caused them create a fake scenario, and I won.  Still, my emails suck when I am mad and frustrated - BUT YOU CAN""T READ VOICE IN AN NEUTRAL EMAIL, KRISTEN.)

Thank God(ess) for Reddit, I guess?  Helps with the manic rants - helps because I can take it down - and helps me process my endless, upset thoughts."

AmItheAsshole,fpnsihc,t3_gej0xp,1588771638.0,"I feel with all this time the legal industry and the financial industry is possessed with this incredibly misinformed idea that faxes are somehow more accurate than scanning something into a PDF.

They literally do not know how computers and faxes work. and I can tell you from experience the entire FAFSA website accepts PDF uploads pretty much exclusively and sometimes jpegs or pngs

Get your computer screen with your ""Fill And Sign"" sig then use your phone to take a picture save it as a JPEG.

Go into your quick photo options for editing then crop out the screen and just leave the document. Then play with the contrast a little so it doesn't look so much like a screen and then send it to them as a jpeg.

I'm telling you this in the world now PDF is how business should be conducted by now. Not only can you sign documents and fill documents with a fill & sign option, you can sign electronically with an encrypted ID, and secure documents that are completely legal and are more secure than a fax.

They don't get that scanning a document into a pdf is no different than a fax machine scanning a document and sending it through a phone line to another fax machine.

if colleges have employees who can't manage to learn how to use Adobe Acrobat they need to be let go.

My other advice is to call the FAFSA, get on your account on their site, and directly upload it to them. There is a place in there EXACTLY for this."

Sometimes new cat owners do not realize how social cats are and that they live in packs and colonies not single. 

As you can imagine being taken away from your best friends and put in the house all by yourselves is pretty scary and sad.

If you've been working from home or now you're currently having to work away from home andvgine 5 to 10 hours a day kitty is going to be very sad and very lonely without a friend to play with.

The experts like Jackson Galaxy and Kitten Lady agree on this."

It takes time and just gentle him with hand feeding him his favorite soft foods and treats.  Play with him with a sock as a barrier or use a glove.  Reward him when he plays nice lavishly with praise and pets.  

But don't scream at him if he hurts you if you can.  You can say ""no"" and set him down.  I've had my moments where kitty decided do a leap of faith on me with claws out."

bipolar,fpmew11,t3_ge6398,1588731562.0,"I can't fathom your situation - but the distraction I can understand after a severe episode.

My tools:

1. I lean into it in the sense that when everything is the same priority I move from thing to thing to thing until they are all done. Cooking is NOT one of those things.
2. I coach myself through verbally (I know talking to myself) through step by step things like washing dishes or cooking or getting ready in the morning so I do all the steps.
3. When it comes to work it helps to either map it out on paper or map it out on Google Docs.  I used to have a old-fashioned desk pad I'd draw out my lists and ideas on then scratch them out at the end of every sheet and record any vital info I wrote down.
4. I use my online calendars and phone alarms exclusively to direct me.  I will absolutely forget or follow some conclusive narrative that leads me into the wrong time perception.
5. If you are doing something that requires to turn something off, like the heat or the water faucet or to check the temp on something or something that might catch on fire - don't leave the immediate area for any reason.  Just stay close.  Burning stuff sucks.  Burning down your kitchen really sucks (happened to a friend ot me.)
6. Routine - this is just a BP undercurrent goal - do the same healthy things every single day. Three balanced meals.  Take your meds. Sleep sleep sleep! ( use anything healthy you can to get your 8-12 hours in)
7. Automate everything - autobill  pay, order online, and order your groceries so you don't have to walk around the store trying to choose in a hurry or hungry.  Do Auto-refills on meds.  Have them mailed to your house along with your vitamins."
