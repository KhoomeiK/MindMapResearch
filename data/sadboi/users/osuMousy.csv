depression,f7t3mtr,t3_dxm60j,1574000673.0,"I haven’t cried in about 2 years. I’m 16. I can produce tears, I do when I yawn or cut onions however I can’t seem to be able to cry. I’ve tried to by thinking about stuff that would make any normal person « sad » however it doesn’t make me sad because I don’t really care about those hypothetical « sad » situations. 
This sounds edgy and I know it but I never feel sad from real life situations. The only times I can feel kind of bad is when I get attached to a character in a movie, series or anime. 
I forgot to mention that I easily feel bad for animals though. It’s as if I didn’t give a fuck about what happens to humans, like I don’t care about them so I’m not sad when something bad happens to them. 

Other than that, the only negative emotions I seem to be able to have are only related to anger. 

To add to all of this, it’s also been 2 years since I’ve been numb emotionally speaking. 
I haven’t been diagnosed because I don’t have therapy but I’ve been told a few times by other people that I may have depression, which is why I browse this sub."
