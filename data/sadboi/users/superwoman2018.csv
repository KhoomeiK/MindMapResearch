Parents divorced, gained 100 pounds, had hidden learning disability that kept me from being able to form proper relationships. Meeting my husband was only good thing that came my way. After years of not being able to have an adult career of any sort and people treating me like crap after becoming obese, I became a housewife at age 32 and dropped out of life. Real life is so disappointing so I became a homebound hermit and live vicariously through television and internet now. I miss traveling and getting out, but not the disappointment of meeting lame people."
