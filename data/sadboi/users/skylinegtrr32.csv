You have to either waste a good sniper shot to remove the box, then reload and shoot again (by then they’re boxed up and safe, while also knowing your general location as well) or if you take an ar shot to drop their box and then switch to snipe they most likely box up by the time u pop the sniper shot anyways.

As u/J_M_Z said, the extra inputs make things a lot faster as you don't have to remove your hands from the sticks to jump, reload, crouch, reset, etc. (depends on how you set the keybinds) as the buttons are on the back and easily accessible. I would say also try practicing edits for the majority of the time you spend in creative as edits are the trickiest part of playing on controller. The aiming and building components are much easier than pulling off complex edits or building/complex edits at the same time. 

Unfortunately, I'm kinda removed from controller now as I've made the switch but that's what helped me a few seasons ago at least so hopefully those tips will be of use to you.

Amd,fbjz0h1,t1_fbjmewt,1576942278.0,"Exactly... I upped my PSU from single daisy chained power cables on a 650 W PSU to 2 individual cables on a 700 W PSU, clean install of windows, messed around in the BIOS for hours, made sure Wattman wasn't enabled or at least the overlay was disabled, etc. and it pushes way few frames than my rx580 did on a ""weaker"" setup."
Amd,fbjxbzn,t3_edklqs,1576941525.0,"On Fortnite my Rx 5700 xt runs at 800 MHz on all low settings 1080p and stutters (I used to have an rx 580 that ran smoother). If I up the settings to max then it runs higher fps than if I ran all low settings... (around 180-200, boosts to 2030 MHz, and doesn't stutter at all). I do not wish to run max settings as it puts me at a competitive disadvantage and the game looks perfectly fine on all low settings anyways.

I also attempted to play Borderlands 3 and ended up with the same problem. Unless I ran max settings the clocks would sit at 600-800 MHz and stutter like a mf. CSGO was sitting at like 300 MHz. I had people telling me over and over that ""It doesn't need to boost since you're hitting the fps target"" while it clearly is not because it drops from 200 fps to 30 and then back to 200 every 5 seconds.

Adrenalin 2020 seemed to help somewhat as I know Wattman was messing with everything for sure. After cleanly installing windows, updating all drivers to the newest, changing my PSU to a 700W with individual 8 pins for GPU power instead of daisy chained pcie cables, and flashing the BIOS to the most recent it seems to be doing better (not as much stuttering, higher fps, and slightly higher clock speeds) but it still is not where it could be. Hopefully for our sake this is resolved in the drivers soon as this is severely limiting the power I know this card has. My old rx580 shouldn't be running higher clock speeds, fps, and no stutters when it costed a third of what I paid for my 5700 xt.

Also - I have tried disabling PCI-e 4.0 because I have heard this can be a major problem on the x470 mobos but haven't found any setting to change this specifically or if there even is one that exists within the Asus BIOS. I see a bunch of posts stating to make sure 3.0 is set, but I haven't found any way to make sure it is set to 3.0 and if not, how to change it. I'm fairly new to PC's and built my first system only 4 months ago so if there is something obvious that I am missing please go easy on me lmfao.

Edit: (Will be upgrading to a R7 2700X today as well - I wanted to upgrade for my streaming but I'm interested to see if the switch has any affect on my GPU issue)."

The card sits at 800-1200 MHz in Fortnite and doesn't boost or even hit ""base clock"" speeds unless I max out all settings.

The card itself is extremely impressive because when it does boost the thermals are low and the card is killer but when half of my games are running at an 8th of their potential for no reason it gets annoying. I can't bring myself to return it because I love the card and want to stick with AMD but I hope something is done soon.

FortniteCompetitive,ez05kph,t1_eyyi5um,1567631248.0,"Agreed. Most of the time it can be prevented. Snipers are high risk/high reward. Peeking out to nab a shot can just as easily end up with you getting beamed or sniped yourself. While some say the heavy sniper is OP I don't see that being the case, but I wouldn't be butthurt if they did scale back the damage on the heavy bc a 150 body shot can be pretty hefty I suppose. 

I agree that one shot w/ a headshot makes sense and everywhere else damage slightly reduced, but ultimately these things happen because of poor planning or positioning. I sometimes go back to watch my teammates in replay after they get sniped to find that they left a wall open to their back or something like that. Had that been accounted for they wouldn't have been sniped. When I play I always act as if someone, somewhere has their sites on me and that I need to throw them off a bit. Jumping every now and then and hiding behind natural cover as I run around has helped me to avoid being sniped nearly as often. 

I do agree that double heavy snipes can suck lol. I've been on the receiving end of that a few times and there isn't really anything you can do. But at least it's nothing as bad as the mech lol. I'd rather have someone pull off a nasty shot from hella far away on me than get curb stomped by a brute. One at least requires some semblance of skill and timing."

I understand how the advantage is ridiculously unfair. I just dislike the method they used to ""balance it."" A flip of the coin is a dumb way to decide who gets the wall...

They should've picked either to favor the attacker or the defender because the uncertainty is annoying. When my 0 ping allowed me to take walls, despite the unfair advantage, there was certainty for me. Without certainty you have to worry about not getting the wall and potentially being edited on and then pumped in the face. Even if the ""turtler"" had the replace every time it would be better because then at least I would know and be able to counter this some other way.

gloriouspcgamingrace,eyw2s6h,t3_cwqmxy,1567519405.0,"I second this! I love my model o and it works beautifully if I use fingertip grip (this is not something I am used to, but I am improving greatly with the switch). I would like a bigger model o for work so I can palm grip it for more comfort because the current model o is too small to palm grip for me."
pcmasterrace,eyljzg3,t1_eylgjdv,1567186239.0,"If a car had a minor problem such as no power steering fluid and you couldn't turn the wheel easily you wouldn't show up to a mechanic and say ""the car is broken."" You would say something like ""It is difficult to turn the wheel"" or ""the car makes an odd noise when I turn the wheel"" or even ""the wheel seems stiff."" All of those would work even if you had no clue that it was the power steering fluid and it could get the ball rolling for the mechanic. 

But what if a computer won't connect to the internet? Instead of saying ""The computer works, but when I try to use the internet it says - insert error message here - on the screen"" my mom will yell at me and say, ""the computer isn't working."" Then I have to ask how so? I will get a response along the lines of ""I can't get on to pay my bills."" 
""Okaaay, so is the internet not working at all? Is the computer not turning on? Is that why you can't pay them? What's the problem?""
Then I get some snarky response like ""of course the internet isn't working"" as I would know from her initially telling me that the computer is broken and she cannot pay her bills that the problem was internet related. What if the reason was because google chrome or internet explorer wasn't working? What if there was some bs popup that kept her from getting on to the webpage? Or even maybe the computer wouldn't boot which would clearly prevent you from getting on to pay the bills. There is no specificity and they expect you to just KNOW what is wrong... sight unseen. 

The scenario above has happened before and it was because the ethernet cable was a little loose. 
""Maybe check the ethernet cable?"" 
""What's that"" 
""The cable that looks kinda like a phone line"" 
""Where is that"" 
""On the back of the computer""
""I don't know which one"" 
""There are flashing indicator lights near it"" 
""I don't feel like doing this you will have to walk me through it later"" 

WHAT HAPPENED TO PAYING YOUR BILLS LOL

I asked my brother to check later and the cable had come loose as it was basically taut. My mom had pulled the computer forward so it was closer to turn on and had stretched all the cables to their max without giving it any thought at all lol. But she claimed it wasn't her fault... Idk how tech support reps deal with this bs on a daily basis if I cannot even handle my own mother."

FortniteCompetitive,eyl0u4k,t3_cx6iyj,1567173416.0,"If you pay close attention to how he writes you can see how he has the mindset of a child and cannot accept his mistake for what it was. ""Literally not hurting anyone"" by teaming on someone in a cash cup where positioning could come down to a single point? Regardless of where sour ended up placing (haven't checked) this is *extremely* harmful and does hurt other players' chances of earning winnings. Imagine if it was sour and someone else that teamed on Sway? It would be an unrelenting shitstorm from Sway and his ten year old minions on social media."
pcmasterrace,eyl073z,t1_eykys8j,1567172952.0,"Yes, that's true.

My mom can not write an **email** without my help whereas my nana (literally her own mother) actively uses amazon to order things, ignores spam/scammer emails b/c she knows of the danger, etc. at 76 years old lmfao. I want to just ignore her and tell her to figure it out, but as a 20 year old who still lives somewhat ""under her roof"" I feel obligated to help because of the repercussions if I don't. She should clearly learn herself at over 50 y/o now, but she doesn't make the effort and it's infuriating to get a call asking me to book her appointments and fix computer issues while I'm at work or in class.

Age, I think, can often help contribute to this sense of ""learned helplessness"" but it does not directly cause it as you see in your dad's case or my nana. A lot of older people assume it's too hard and never actually bother learning because ""they didn't grow up with it like we did"" or whatever bs excuse they come up with. My parents have owned computers since the 90's. My dad chose to adapt and learn the basics whereas my mom just refused to bother.

My dad, while not extremely tech savvy, at least makes an attempt. He signed into his email and downloaded the gmail app to his own iphone, he set up a work laptop by himself (he asked for my help when buying it but that's reasonable because he doesn't understand all the specs), and figured out many other things my mom wouldn't even bother taking a glance at before ringing me. 

The worst part about it all? My siblings that are younger and still live at home act clueless and don't want to be bothered by her so it's all deferred to me. I've talked to my siblings about this but they clearly don't care because I'm still getting calls about how to ""**restart the internet**"""

pcmasterrace,eykxymz,t1_eykvn48,1567171290.0,"This is the exact same in my household. I'm away at university and I get calls like this from my mom almost daily. It's so hard to: 

1.) Explain something simple to someone that has no concept of technology because it is not simple to them or ***they refuse to listen and learn****.* (The problem with my mom is that instead of taking time to figure things out she calls me because I can fix the problem easily)

2.) Understand what's wrong when the only cues given are ""It's not working"" ""I think the computer crashed"" ""The computer is broken"" instead of telling me useful things like ""it won't load this webpage"" or ""I can't send my email"" where the issue could be internet related or something I can actually troubleshoot."
MouseReview,eyjjep9,t1_eyjhz23,1567120498.0,"Right, like I said, it’s not for everybody. I don’t eat things and use my mice at the same time in general, with or without holes in them. All a matter of personal preference. I eat snacks at my desk, but always wash my hands or wipe them off before even thinking about touching my phone, mouse, or anything else so that’s why I was saying this is definitely not for someone that eats and USES the mouse simultaneously. I eat at my desk, sure. I def don’t eat and use the mouse. I would just stick with the fk bc like you said it’s working for you and is easy to keep clean, but for a lot of people this works better for them :)"
gloriouspcgamingrace,eyjgdtk,t1_eyjg209,1567118680.0,"Mine works well for me but I think a larger one would be even better than my current! The value is insane indeed! My previous mouse costed more money, was heavier, looked worse, had a crappier sensor (it felt this way at least), and the holes help my hand from the normal clammy feeling I get while playing games."
MouseReview,eyjf8oo,t1_eyjej7j,1567117981.0,"I eat at my table and it’s fine for sure! However,  I don’t touch any of my mice/keyboard until I finish my food and wash my hands."
MouseReview,eyjdgc4,t1_eyjc59x,1567117129.0,"I mean I would argue not to eat chips or food with any mouse, but I suppose you really wouldn’t want to especially with this mouse lol. I assumed the majority of people clean their hands or at least make sure they aren’t greasy w/ food on them when they use their mouse, but if not then this is definitely not a mouse for them and the closed designs would be better at keeping that out. 

Eating and touching a mouse will always build up residue either way. With this mouse it will get inside and definitely be worse, but with others it will still gum up near the buttons and make the mouse slimy and slippery on the surface."
