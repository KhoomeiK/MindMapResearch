BreakUps,fp9n8wj,t3_gc35jn,1588430341.0,"I am going through the same thing. One day he would act like he cares so much about me and he is fully invested in us and suddenly go all cold and indifferent like I don't even exist. He managed to break me and my core beliefs and every single hope I had for us. The damage that he has done is irreversible. I would be a fool If I gave him a third chance. There is this quote that I saw on Instagram ""We keep forgiving people till we love them. Once, we start hating them it gets easier to never forgive them."" I hope we heal through our traumas and chose the love we deserve."
self,fp5c14s,t1_fp4t8r2,1588323725.0,Nope. Just on occasions.But I wonder how bad the situation might be if he was an addict.
offmychest,fove6ho,t3_g9gxy8,1588099818.0,You've scored yourself a keeper üíô
relationship_advice,fol236o,t1_fn4ilf3,1587853366.0,It was really insightful. Thankyou so much üíú
sex,fjycycr,t1_fjybsl6,1583694235.0,"No, because we were in different cities. And now when we are in the same city, my infection flared up big time. For the last two days I am on antibiotics and having mild fever. My sex drive is pretty low rn and I feel guilty for us. He's not able to have a healthy sexual life because of me. I am pretty much in a lot of pain for the last 2 days. Although the general symptoms like pain while urinating have become better but there is just this general discomfort. I also know that having regular sex would probably flare up UTI more. What if I'm never able to have a healthy sexual life? I'm really worried for us."
BreakUps,fg12kue,t3_ew6nal,1580419585.0,I am going through the exact same thing. The exact samr thing. But in my case the difference was that he going through depression and I had a really strong feeling that he likes his female best friend/ therapist. I could see everything clearly after we broke up and continuing FWB with him kinda hurted me. We've gone for NC for 2 months and he has not even once tried to approach me. It's just sad.
BreakUps,fg11nx2,t1_ffza5s8,1580419132.0,I'm also 22. It's been almost one and a half month of NC.  It took me everything to get out of this heartbreak. Some days I still fight with myself and feel bad about how things ended. I don't see myself going through all the trauma again too. It totally wrecked all my insides.
Indiangirlsontinder,fg0zhiu,t1_ffzg4k7,1580418031.0,">Don‚Äôt go spark hunting, but go looking for someone willing to bang rocks together with you until the spark happens.

Thissssssssss made so much sense to me. Thankyou for this."
UnsentLetters,ff8kupy,t3_es20ya,1579683358.0,I'm sorry. I should have been more empathetic. I should have given some space. It was not supposed to end this bad.
BreakUps,feiv9fm,t3_epaddz,1579148146.0,Yeah. After giving myself few months I am able to realize that we both were at faults. It's unfortunate that we couldn't make it work. But I don't hate him anymore. If things turned out certain way that means they were meant to happen. I hope he finds what he's looking for. And I hope the same for me.
BreakUps,fei49u6,t3_ep4237,1579129955.0,Lesson learned. I realized it quite late though.
self,fe4fo2j,t1_fe0gv5o,1578858735.0,Thankyou so much for this. I relate to this post very much. I was obsessed with my feelings towards my best friend from work because we just hit it together so effortlessly. I've moved on now after realizing that my feelings don't matter because he is not available. But this comment of yours really gave me a lot of hope. I hope I find it and when I do I'm ready to accept it.
BreakUps,fdwrbmj,t3_en7xgn,1578761577.0,"Yeah same.Yesterday, I saw him in my dream and I broke down right there both in my dream and irl."
depression,fdjwl60,t3_eloddk,1578489833.0,Yeah. It feels like everybody is looking at you with their judgemental eyes and talking about you. Also there's no food or alcohol there so obv I can't distract myself from them. It just feels lonely.
self,fdhq7lh,t3_eleut5,1578428002.0,This is so wholesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
BreakUps,fdb6fpz,t3_ekdsw0,1578254362.0,Exactly. One day I'm all okay and moving on with the the no contact thing and on some days something triggers and I lose it all. I start overthinking and cry myself to sleep. I guess he's better without me.
BreakUps,fd5kek9,t3_ej8nuq,1578178488.0,Same. Talking to them about my day and listening to theirs and sharing music. But I guess it's okay. Everyone figures it out.
BreakUps,fd5jzl5,t3_ek2pc9,1578178368.0,Hey. It was your first relationship and people make mistakes. She might be a caring person and loved you but I believe in every relationship there should be some dealbreakers. Everyone should have their own. Things which are definitely not acceptable no matter how much love or respect is there. If she is abusing you physically and mentally then that's the biggest deal breaker. I would definitely suggest you to take some time off from dating and work on yourself. Maybe hit gym again or start a new hobby or focus on your career. But don't rush yourself till you are properly healed. That's what I am trying to do after getting my heart broken. All the bestüòä

depression,fcrhqqj,t3_eijqqx,1577901975.0,I've never been to a therapist. In my country bad mental health is still a taboo. I'll try to find someone though just in case things get worse.
Anxiety,fcr2hph,t1_fc6yiof,1577895828.0,Yes true. I tend to overthink a lot about everything. I guess doing things instead of just thinking about future would help. But I'm just losing sleep and my mental health is deteriorating so I'm not even able to do the basic mundane tasks like taking a bath or getting out of bed.
Anxiety,fcr24eo,t1_fc70vir,1577895666.0,"Hey, thankyou so much for this. I hope 2020 treats us better and if it doesn't, then we treat ourselves better. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
depression,fcr0413,t1_fcqz6yo,1577894805.0,"Yes, they know about the breakup. They know that I'm spending most of my time alone. My sister is there with me and talks to me out of it sometimes. When I spend some time out with friends I feel better. But that happiness is short lived. Like the moment I come back and lay on my bed that bubble bursts."
BreakUps,fconya4,t3_ei4bco,1577836995.0,"It's 5 a.m now and even the thought of him not being in my life anymore is terryfying to me. Everything changed and he changed and I could not even recognize if that's the person I even loved. He did hurt me though and I could never forgive him for that. I guess there's no other way to let go of all the pain and the heartache. I pray that 2020 treats us better and if it doesn't, then we treat ourselves better."
MadeMeSmile,fcjw9ww,t3_ehdg0n,1577707805.0,This made me year up. When we were kids even we used to do that with our dad.All three of us used get on top of him and hug and kiss him. Not like we don't do it now but not that often. I think we should start this ritual again üòä
BreakUps,fcgxu04,t3_eh63c5,1577645111.0,Hey even I feel the same. The Universe has always been kind to me and tbh I think they taught me a great deal about relationships and love. I'm heading into the new year with a lot more clarity and peace. I hope the same for everyone struggling ‚ù§Ô∏è
Anxiety,fc84hl4,t1_fc74fdb,1577526689.0,I know right. I just start listening to my playlist thinking that even if everything changes in the future my music would still be there. But the idea of rubber band sounds very good too. I'll try to do this and I'll let you know if it helps me. Thank you very much. Wishing you a very happy New Year too. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Anxiety,fc843sv,t1_fc77d4a,1577526435.0,"Hey, thanks a lot. Yes that's the main problem that life is so uncertain at times and sometimes there's nothing we can do to just make it right. I'll try try to list all my worst case scenarios which I can control from not happening that I'm worried about and try to find out how could I prevent them from happening. Your advice really made sense to me. Thanks a lot again ‚ù§Ô∏è Happy New year to you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Anxiety,fc6sqcd,t3_eghxgp,1577488523.0,Same. I am really scared. I am assuming the worst that could happen and how everything in my life could go downhill. Im from India and there is so much political unrest here. I'm scared for my family and for my country.
BreakUps,fc51r07,t3_efznhr,1577438637.0,"Same here man. I wasted my whole year trying to pursue love. Searching it in places it was not even there. Desperately seeking for someone with whom I can share    everything. I guess I was looking for it in the wrong places. Romantic love ain't everything. Instead I'll start focusing on myself and improving myself so that when and if that love comes in future, I'm ready for it."
r4r,fc1dspn,t3_efbzgl,1577315754.0,Merry Christmas little sister. I wish you all the strength and I hope you make him proud one day by being the happiest version of yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è Sending you all the love

BreakUps,fbwdm7f,t3_eeelv8,1577147143.0,Nowhere near close. I hope one day they won't matter much.
AmItheAsshole,fbrjest,t3_ee4lyk,1577043426.0,NTA. She should have acknowledged you and as a host make sure that you are comfortable. That's the basic decency. She might be busy but it does not take much to either smile or wink from a distance to let the other person feel acknowledged.
BreakUps,fbnyxjz,t3_edybki,1577004926.0,My ex was the same. He had some mental health issues too and was going through depression and he was bipolar. I always used to give him chances and justify his behavior. But sadly things don't work out that way. You need to realize who to let go and who to be patient with.
BreakUps,fblw66y,t3_edsx55,1576971861.0,It gives me a lot of hope.
BreakUps,fblvu63,t3_ecp3pq,1576971610.0,This made me feel so better. My ex is now having fun and going to concerts with the girl he told me to not worry about. We have planned so much to do this December but I am just spending my days all alone crying or sleeping on my bed. It's true that he is not in love with me anymore and nothing that I would do could change that. I'm just healing from all the trauma he caused in my life and would start afresh in 2020.
relationship_advice,fbhllue,t1_fbgq09d,1576876586.0,Hey hey that's not rape. It was consensual. And he stopped when he realized that I'm serious and not just moaning.
depression,fbhl99o,t3_ed99oq,1576876344.0,I really hope whatever you're going through right now it gets better and everything works out for you. People really are angels sometimes. Wish you all the happiness.
relationship_advice,fbhjuxv,t3_edfc8q,1576875386.0,You guys are clearly different. Break it off man. Stop forcing relationships. you don't feel like it that's a big reason to not continue it.
relationship_advice,fbgfs9n,t3_ed9kd2,1576848091.0,I feel sorry for the guy. He deserves someone better.
BreakUps,fbgd1y1,t1_fbfhu2x,1576845435.0,Same. With the same repeated cycle of getting to know each other and then dating and being emotionally vulnerable and investing so much time and mental space only for one day when they tell you that they can't do this anymore. It's mentally exhausting.
