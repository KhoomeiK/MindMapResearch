lonely,ffnrpr7,t3_eu2zo1,1580069873.0,"with that attitude you‚Äôll never get a girlfriend. it doesn‚Äôt matter about your looks dude (sometimes), you just gotta have some confidence in your personality and what you can bring to a relationship. if you like a girl, then try your best and go for it. the worst that can happen is them not feeling the same. dont worry about things like this too much (not saying you do), just go about your life and if the opportunity is there, take it, whats the harm?"

makingmusic,f91wp44,t1_f91l6rv,1575003750.0,on what part exactly
DevilMayCry,f61yqdu,t1_f602zpi,1572650050.0,"that actually wouldn‚Äôt be bad at all. the parallel could lead to more run time, and a constant mix up of pace. im leaning more on the two different story modes so that they can put as much levels and story into the main three as possible, but i would to see this regardless.

also lucia would be amazing, especially in the polished dmc state. maybe a lady nights campaign or dlc campaign. hopefully all characters would be playable in the bloody palace, so at least we can get some love for them in there, but having her part of the main narrative would be dope!"
DevilMayCry,f5z9mbj,t3_do9nex,1572570899.0,"what do you guys think DMC6 is going to be like?? what do you they‚Äôre going plotwise? also what would you like to see in terms of new gameplay features/mechanics?
for me, i want the plot to be nero based this time, meaning i want the focus to be solely on nero, his relationship with kyrie and nico, how he views and handles the world, and hopefully closure on his family dilemma. (my ideal final boss is vergil beating dante, becoming a true devil, and nero using a sort of passed down power from dante to defeat vergil. kinda nutty but also wanted true dt nero vs vergil in dmc5 and i got that lmfao)
gameplay wise i kinda want them to expand on neros mechanics, make it more complex but just as rewarding. maybe introduce a hub world instead of levels for more exploration."
