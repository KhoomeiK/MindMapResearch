Along with my ANA, whatever markers for Sjogrens they looked for were negative so my rheum recommended the lip biopsy. 
Essentially, they take a couple of those small little balls on the inside of your lip (where your teeth hit) and look for signs of Sjogrens. Mine was easy peasy..two stitches and I was done. I didn‚Äôt have nerve problems after but I got a good doctor.
