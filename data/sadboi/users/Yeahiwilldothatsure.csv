If she's questioning whether she loves you or not, from my standpoint of having done similar things that she is, that's a power move. If I said that to a guy, I wanted to see it affect him. I wanted him to fight for me to love him. But if he did it in a certain way then it felt desperate and I would lose all interest.


It's a shitty thing to love someone and want to help and be there, but she's abusing you. And to sit there and be like ""wah it's my illness I'm sorry I'll get better...but..."" Well two months ago the pandemic wasn't happening, so why has this sudden change in thoughts happened? Because without saying that it's harder to keep you sympathetic and soft and ready to move when she pulls the string. 

I know bipolar makes me do things that maybe I wouldn't if I weren't diagnosed bipolar...but I can never lay blame on it like it's a totally different entity and then dust my hands off and carry on. 

This isn't a fair situation for you and unless she is serious about the help...which she can use telemedicine for to at least get the ball rolling, nothing is going to change.

Half  the country has bipolar disorder any given day based solely on what they say. 

I'd be more concerned about someone always complaining about bipolar disorder and how hard it is and how they're a victim of it, blah blah. It's a time of sensitivity for mental illness which is great, but it also causes a lot of false positives and people that are lost and searching for a solution to find one..,and they're able to adjust their actions so it does match more. 

Idk, I don't trust anyone that whines about having bipolar disorder. For me, it's not something Im actively aware of enough to constantly be crying about it...because it's just how my brain functions and feels normal to me."
