religion,fr4si85,t1_fr4jcdn,1589895994.0,"Well I have ben through alot in my life. through many different paths and varieties of christian faith, along with some magic or pagan interest. I have become angered by all the faiths and how much they spread a message of separation. Yet most of their teachings are about love, peace and unity. These are values I believe in. I have come to understand that i may be able to know and ant, it reason for action, build an ant farm and feed them; that ant can never know a human, its ways, reasons or society.  This is how I feel about the limitless, infinite loving God. All the books are written by man trying to understand something that is impossible for our mind to grasp. Some of the words make sense, yet all fall short of any true knowledge. I can enjoy messages of faith and love, of need and hope, but when words are used to separate each other, and define others as enemies of a faith it makes no sense to me. Those are political messages not of divine origin no matter what book of faith they come from. Even Jesus, and the psalms taught that we all are Gods.  Through my laspses in religious faith I found a truth about myself and my need of God not the dogmas surrounding the various beliefs. The name doesn't matter, it is the intention and what you hold in your heart that matters. God will hear you. I will share with you my belief now. Take it for what its worth, but it works for me and keeps me focused. 


I have found is that the simple message of God is personal.

I need to look to a power greater than myself.

When i need to scream in pain because the world is dark, god is there to listen to my pain.

When i feel such a swell in my heart i am going to burst with Joy, i thank god for all he has given and he is there.

When life becomes to difficult to bear i can find no help in man. god is there hears my plea and answers, yet not always in ways i want

When i feel like one more step on this earth is to much, god is beside me and props me up.

When i am so lonely and i need to just talk to someone god is there.

When i see someone hurt or in need god is there to remind me i have been in need and its my turn to share.

God is and has always been there because i carry him with me or he carries me with him.

If it is not love than it is not God.

This is what I have found, and how I live."

The Covid-19 virus is weakening our nation severely with every passing day and bill the congress passes to spend more debt just to keep people at home. The idea of a vaccine is very far away.  There was a viral drug researched by MIT,  that was defunded in 2011. That drug is Called DRACO  (for double-stranded RNA activated caspase oligomerizers). Basically, when one end of DRACO binds to dsRNA, it signals the other end of DRACO to initiate apoptosis, killing cells before a virus has a chance to replicate. 

It is a broad spectrum anti-viral treatment, that has been through the early trials before being de-funded. In theory it should work against all viruses. It has been show to be effective against the H1N1 virus and may be very effective against COVID-19. If one legislator could see the possible benefit of this new technological break through they may be able to save the nation for a few million instead of trillions, and at a much faster pace.  This may be the answer to our current crisis long before a vaccine is ready.

worldnews,fqeqqhh,t3_gi94ek,1589312034.0,"In 2016 Nature Magazine published an article about China engineering a bat coronavirus and scientists worried it would leak.

In 2010 scientists in Wuhan published a study stating they combined HIV parts with SARS. This was building on a 2007 study where they tried combining a SARS-like bat coronavirus with HIV pseudovirus that was not previously infectious to humans. While they were researching the SARS-like bat Coronavirus, they were unhappy with the low rate at which it infected human cells. So they genetically altered it to make it infect human cells more effectively -- by giving it an HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) outer shell, which enabled the SARS-like coronavirus to attack human cells via ACE2 receptors.

2015 study, scientists in Wuhan: They took a bat coronavirus and made a chimera virus that specifically attaches to the ACE2 protein to ""to maximize the opportunity for pathogenesis and vaccine studies in mice"".

And this is significant because what I just described pretty much sums up our current Coronavirus (first study published about COVID-19, attaches toACE2 receptors, same scientists as the study from a decade ago, Peng Zhou) .

In February a Chinese scientist published a study saying the most likey source of the virus is the lab due to the types of viruses studied there and multiple cases of contamination. Study has since been scrubbed from the internet. PDF LINK

A picture of the Lab in Wuhan, tweet from the Chinese gov. in 2018 / UPDATED LINK . The only BSL4 Lab in all of China, in the epicenter of the outbreak. With Asia’s largest virus bank. How convenient they deleted the tweet after this post.

Reports that the lung damage it causes is like a combination of SARS and AIDS. People still testing positive after recovering and even dying after being discharged from the hospital

Know what we have legitimate proof of? SARS accidentally leaking out of bio labs multiple times in China before.

I’m merely spreading legitimate articles, studies, and news stories that span over a decade, all tying back to Wuhan, engineered viruses, bat coronaviruses, shady Chinese student arrests smuggling vials into China and Harvard Bio-Chem head getting money from Wuhan. Canadian government scientists who trained at Wuhan Lab getting fired last year.. China silencing multiple *Doctors* who tried sounding the alarm in December.

They are the facts. What is also a fact is when you piece them all together, they get labeled as unverified claims with absolutely no valid counterargument or evidence against it. Yet, despite how much overwhelming facts point to this, it’s still not true because they said so? Again no one is denying it came from bats, so they arent debunking anything. It is also not a bioweapon, i never claimed it was, so they are not debunking anything there either.

FYI you’ll notice a lot of these articles have disclaimers (some brand new since yesterday) about them being used as a conspiracy. They offer absolutely no counter argument other than “it came from bats, therefor it is not from the lab.” Uhh okay, not disputing it came from bats. You will also notice the Chinese trolls tearing apart the HIV aspect of this, while ignoring all the rest of the evidence. (check comments, obvious whos working for China.)"

That is not what I said. You are misunderstanding me. I never called Thelma a hate group, they are not large enough nor organized enough to be considered in my philosophy. If anything I gave up on magick due to the quote I wrote from the lesser keys and moved away from it.

Crowley was its founder, you cannot deny that, so it was born from the mind of a racist madman with uberman beliefs. I have read enough of him when I was a child, and. I am still selling off those books. and his Tarot card set, I cannot read it anymore the symbolism is to deep and I get lost in it.

I am saying that he helped inspire the nazis. Not that the religion still carries his anti-semitism. It is not a hate group, and it is not the believers that are hateful usually, it is the dogmas that turn good people into hate fuelled."

I love the part where Crowley suggests using the Swastika on the tea cups. 

But honestly magic is all a joke. This quote made it clear to me in my youth when I read Crowley's ""Magick In Theory and Practice"",  from the Goetia of the Lemegeton of King Solomon "" Whence magicians are profound and diligent searchers into nature; they, because of their skill, know how to anticipate an effect, the which to the vulgar shall seem to be a miracle.""

You may be a wonderful person, I do not know you. But religion is the #1 thing that can make good people do evil things. It is a political system that has stolen good teaching and corrupted them, and altered them in translation. Hence Homosexual being added in 1956 where it originally meant men who lie with boys, or pederasts. Something many leaders of the church are guilty of. I can also say martin Luther hated the jewish and codified it in his teachings. Making the final solution easier to swallow by the masses."

Peace and love with a sword.  And still destruction of knowledge and holding humanity back is still a much worse crime than killing people. There are always more people, it took centuries to gather the knowledge learned by the ancient cultures. I cannot keep this up because I have dinner to make.

 Modern religions are political institutions, they are so far decoupled from their reason for existence and they survive on dogma not the faiths philosophy or mythos. They know that they cannot survive under historical scrutiny and have done everything in their power to slow human progress and retain control on people. All religions are evil, and the indoctrination of youth is the only reason why they are still here.
