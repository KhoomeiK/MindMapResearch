My girlfriend was cute but wasn’t really excited about her, same with her but then we talked and we fell in love. Looks are amazing for superficial dating and hooking up sex but if you want a love or a real relationship then it’s really just waiting till u meet someone who’s meant for u"

BPD,fm8gu4k,t1_fm8egru,1585849135.0,"Clarifying what I meant: people aren’t like us so they don’t hold things deep. So don’t hate yourself for hurting their feelings, people move on easily. Second it’s not your fault u have it but you should also be trying to improve. There’s no reason or excuses no matter what illness you have. 

Yes BPD is 90% uncontrollable but we still have some room for improvement"
BPD,fm8fkzr,t1_fm8egru,1585848519.0,I said the people they effect and I also meant you should still go to treatment because it’s not an excuse

BPD,fm7y2ad,t3_ftkplu,1585839078.0,"Don’t worry about ruining anybody’s life. First of all it’s not entirely our fault that we have BPD. Don’t let anybody make u feel bad for having a disorder. and secondly, yes people are hurt by the things we do but if they matter then they will know it’s a disorder and it’s not personal towards them. We just make it personal because we’re in so much pain and anguish 

Thirdly and most importantly, worry about your life, u should still care for others but you that attacks you more than anyone. People can move on fast from anything if they don’t have BPD so don’t worry. Still try n get better though. It’s one of the most treatable personality disorders out there!"
mentalhealth,fm7x5qd,t3_ftepzi,1585838595.0,"I was thinking about this yesterday. People are locked inside and because of that, are in their thoughts 75% more than normal and are more likely to think ruminate.

But Were also at an age where more people sit on their phones instead of socializing. 

The only people I feel like we’re gonna lose to suicide are the mentally ill. People with depression, bipolar, and personality disorders (especially Cluster b) I think are gonna be most affected."

NPD,fm5ij0o,t3_ft5qfr,1585773600.0,"No it’s more than that. This is barely a trait of NPD. NPD ruins your life because you feel and know you’re entitled to praise and attention. With me, I got attention from girls in high school, along with my dysfunctional family and my perspective of the world is very off. I demand respect and if I don’t I feel suicidal and worthless. 

I also never had a lot of empathy to begin with, which is why most people don’t really like me that much. I’m apparently a self entitled asshole. personality disorders ruin your relationships, jobs, health, and your life. I doubt you have NPD just by what you wrote here"

I have moments where I fit in and it’s draining being around people because they follow social rules and their conversations are too specific and dumb tbh."

mentalillness,flqvvr8,t3_fq3rec,1585407434.0,"I heard a story about a guy who had severe OCD. So severe he couldn’t hold jobs, maintain relationships, it was really difficult for him just to survive the day. One day he had enough and attempted suicide. He survived but he noticed his symptoms were gone. Apparently he shot the part of the brain that the OCD originated. He was symptom free and made straight A’s in college, has a nice job and lives happily.

(Don’t shoot yourself in the head hoping it’ll work like this for u too) this was a 1 and 1,000,000,000 chance and he was luckier than anyone winning the lottery. 

Just thought it was an interesting story but maybe doctors can look into this"
