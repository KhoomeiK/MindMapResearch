abusiverelationships,fp6eylp,t1_fp5pwmy,1588351186.0,"I’m sorry that person said that it was not supportive at all and missed the point of this sub. That note is heavy, and hurtful, and a lot to try to understand. I’m so sorry you’re wife has been hurting you and I’m sure the situation it uncomfortable and awful. I guess there is a general helpful message to be taken from that person’s comment, which is that your wife seems to be feeling very unhappy and stressed as well... maybe things can get better with the right support and communication :) I don’t know your situation and so I can’t say if this is a good willed but misguided attempt at communicating, or a manipulative reflection of your own feelings, or some other abusive ploy. What I can say is there will always be someone there for you when you need them, don’t give up and keep looking for solutions. You belong to yourself first, you owe every cell in your body the respect and love that the other people in our lives demand. Please keep us updated, I’m sending you all my support :)"
AskReddit,fp5uz9v,t3_gaiw0d,1588340494.0,When one friend started cheating on her boyfriend... with my other friend... right in front of me. Took me a while to see through their “youre being so judgmental just accept what the universe brings you” ruse. Now I respect myself and my morals too much and dropped their asses.
Annapolis,fouzn3k,t3_g95v42,1588092992.0,"Pleasant plains is $$$ but right across the naval academy bridge and 10 min from local schools. There are cheaper but still super nice areas right around there. Also as someone who grew up in the area in public school, snobs paint cape st Claire is ‘the bad part of town’ but trust me the biggest problem they have is teenagers smoking weed in their parent’s basements. The housing there is way more affordable and a walk away from the elementary and high school!"

mentalhealth,fmzkwma,t3_fya3gq,1586523419.0,"This is a 100% understandably stressful, hurtful situation. He’s deciding to cope with it through denial and invalidating your feelings but that’s his problem and you have every freedom to chose a different coping mechanism. Maybe one thing that could be helpful is spending this time looking for someone in your area to sublet your part of the lease to if you’re allowed to. If this isn’t possible, brainstorming any productive creative solutions will give you some hope and a possible way out as soon as lock down is over. 
This is more personal and some people don’t like it but whenever I’m in a dark place and don’t feel like there’s a reason to go on, meditating with guided meditations from YouTube helps so much. Especially mid panic attack or emotional break down. 
You have every reason to feel the way you do right now, this is a fucked thing he’s done and fucked situation he’s created. That being said, I really believe you have the power to make it out of this :)
We believe in you, keep us updated❤️"

I unfollowed everything hurtful/unhealthy/unproductive and followed a bunch of healthy happy pages, so now when I scroll through my timeline it’s full of nice reminders and thoughts instead of comparisons and anxiety."
mentalhealth,fla6a43,t3_fnk22w,1584977542.0,Don’t let f*cking incels win they’re lonely because they’re assholes!! Whereas you are looking for genuine human support they find identities in their pathetic lone wolf state that’s literally perpetuated by their own sexism. I’m sorry they bullied you for trying to solve your problem because they can’t understand basic human psychology. They’re mean and you don’t deserve that!
spirituality,fk93dbe,t1_fk92e05,1583967888.0,"I’m so sorry you’ve been having such a hard time, 18006624357 is a helpful number for when you need someone to talk to and you always have this community❤️ I’ve felt like that before too and talking to a therapist helped so much. TWLOHA.com also has lots of helpful blog posts and resources. I know how hard it is to decide to live for yourself and make your own narrative but I truly believe in you. I hope you have a nice day!"
spirituality,fk7eygq,t1_fk756i0,1583935013.0,I’ve been thinking that too! Maybe it’s how nicely you tell them that their opinions isn’t helpful lol
spirituality,fk7esrs,t1_fk74cwg,1583934915.0,"I think there’s a difference here because from my understanding it’s not just that you care about what she thinks of you, you also have your own feelings of regret. Writing is a really helpful way to deal with messy feelings! You could write down what behaviors you weren’t proud of, and how you’re going to change them in the future. You can’t change the past or undo the hurt and that’s an awful, frustrating thing. But we can grow and reflect so that we don’t continue the same cycles. I’m sure you’ve made lots of people feel happy and loved too, I hope you have a nice day☀️"
