This is the time to work on yourself and be comfortable in just being on your own because you are the person that needs to love yourself before ANYONE ELSE. I know I said that I can relate except for attempting suicide (I used to have a ton of thoughts recently though), being alone makes me grateful to look more into myself and discover my self worth. Trust me, in adulthood you’ll realize that friends sometimes aren’t always permanent but you’ll find your real crowd one day. Just appreciate the people you have in your life, stay strong and good luck! Also I’m so sorry that you are dealing with whatever you are dealing with, but you can make it through this.

mentalhealth,fei0agl,t3_ep2usz,1579127502.0,"“Family” (the typical definition) and I put that in quotes tend to be the most toxic of all. Family doesn’t necessarily have to mean blood related but can mean anyone who cares about one another. You can consider us family because we care about you and anyone else you know who is supportive and comforting to you. Forget her and focus on yourself. She’s going to stay miserable while you flourish in life. Those types of people even though she’s your so called “mother” you just need to cut off and doing it is absolutely fine if she’s making you feel negative about your life and yourself. It’s definitely easier said than done because I understand how it makes you feel when someone is constantly attacking you with negative comments but if you have another place to stay with whom you can completely trust I would advise you to do so. You don’t need that constant negativity around you at all and you have such a bright road ahead of you. Don’t let someone who isn’t you dictate to end your life and stay alive so you can see the bright road ahead. Life is definitely not easy and unfair, but there will be opportunities to lead you to the right path, some that you don’t even notice right now. Stay strong, we believe in you!"
kpop,fehxc7i,t3_eb97az,1579125734.0,"Sorry if it’s annoying but this whole one is about BTS.

BTS: Will pull a one direction “hiatus” stunt. 2021 might be their last big year.
Jin: will leave Bts after going to the army within the next year. Will then go on to do acting and star in dramas and variety shows and I feel like he’s going to be a part of a variety show like sujus heechul and be the jokester as well as mature. He is really focusing on his future right now and talks to the boys about how he’s getting older and wants to venture out into different things.
RM: will go on to collab with American artists and go solo after Bts unfortunate disband/hiatus. Either him or g dragon from Big Bang will release a clothing line (mostly GD) and RM will start writing/producing songs for artists.
V: I feel like he will focus on modeling and idk why. I feel like he’s going to get a modeling deal of some sort and start there. I feel like it will be dispatched he is dating. Also I feel like he will open up about his mental health in the group and his sexuality (possibly being bisexual).
Jungkook: Start a solo singing career for sure. He’s going to go for the ballad type music and I think he will still be popular in Korea. Further in the future it will be dispatched that he is dating. Also I feel like he’s going to do a collab with Justin Bieber and idk why lol.
Jhope: Focus on solo rapping and features in songs. I feel like he will try to venture out into American fame but unfortunately will kind of fall off on the popularity which I’m saddened about. But the bright side I feel like he will have a feature with another big western celebrity rapper/singer. Also maybe even mentor trainees.
Jimin: Maybe focus on mentoring and stick with trying to do a singing career. May have a few love quarrels and multiple love scandals. 
Suga: Will continue to try and produce music and write songs for artists. May come out as bisexual and talk about loving and accepting who you are in his songs. He much prefers to stay behind the scenes."
