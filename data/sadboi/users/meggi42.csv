EatingDisorders,fh7voiu,t3_f1pbxj,1581345937.0,"I get this feeling, especially considering how MUCH food you encounter in a grocery store. It can feel a bit like sensory overload. However, the notion that ‘all the food is bad for you’ is misguided—food IS good for you, and the foods you categorize as ‘bad’ or ‘unsafe’ are considered normal to non-disordered eaters. Try this: eat what sounds good and is nutritious (fats, proteins, grains, veggies, fruits, sweets—yes, candy chocolate all that) because food is meant to be enjoyed as well as used for fuel. DO NOT turn over onto the nutrition label and check fat content, ingredients, calories. Those of us in recovery aren’t going on diets anytime soon because (a) diets are fads & statistically proven to be mostly ineffective in making a person ‘healthier’ and (b) losing weight is not the objective when choosing what to eat (unless this is agreed upon with a professional). You are not dirty or unclean or gluttonous for eating natural&artificial sugars, packaged food, or high calorie treats—this will not make you unhealthy or throw you into a body you don’t want. The eating disorder is enough torture for a life; try to be compassionate to yourself and stop looking at the labels."
