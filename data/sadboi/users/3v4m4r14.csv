nosurf,fnv1f0e,t1_fntq0a3,1587277137.0,"The notification that prompts one to enter the reason for unlocking is a nice workaround for iOS given that it cannot show an overlaying popup.

Returning to the app before locking the phone again needs a lot of intrinsic motivation and users usually don‚Äôt have that. It would be better if the reason they entered previously could be displayed automatically without any extra action from the user.

What if the user journey (and app functions) looked like this:
- Unlock the phone (show the notification)
- Tap on the notification (be directed to the app)
- Enter the reason for unlocking (save the reason)
- Do whatever you do on the phone (app is idle)
- Lock the phone without returning to the app (show a notification with the previously entered reason on the lock screen)

In this scenario, the reason would be shown automatically and the lock screen would turn on immediately after locking due to the push notification.

This alternative also has some downsides, though. First, the user may not pay attention to the lock screen after locking the phone.

Second, any kind of a lock screen notification is intrusive and pulls the user back to the advice, thus having the opposite effect than what you originally intended (to reduce phone usage).

Given these pros and cons, I think it is already good if the app simply logs the reasons for unlocking and prompts the user to review them once a week. In that way, the user would have less recollection of why they actually opened the app, but could still somewhat reflect on the whether the reasons of unlocking match what they actually use the device for.

Be very careful with notifications. The whole functionality of notifications is designed to capture our attention and keep us engaged with apps, but there‚Äôs a limit to how many notifications one can take. If you bombard your users with notifications, they might turn them off or uninstall the application and then your app is of no use anymore.

Good luck and let me know if there is anything else I can help you with."
nosurf,fntmu7f,t1_fnt0jm4,1587244828.0,"I love the idea of logging why I unlock the phone, but opening the app as a last thing before locking the phone is too unintuitive.

This one is easier to do when you live in the countryside as you can just open your window and let it all out.

In a town, I would recommend yelling indoors so as to not disturb your neighbours. Maybe a bathroom? Alternatively cover your mouth with a pillow.

It feels like letting the anger flow out of your body through your lungs and mouth. Quite freeing. Feels stupid at first, though.

Ask around whether your neighbours want to join in, too. You can make it a weekly happening.

The cheapest portable washers are around 50‚Ç¨. The nearest public laundry is 4 euros per machine. This means the breakeven point is after 50/4=12.5 washes.

Not to mention the fact that you don‚Äôt have to pack your laundry in a bag, drag yourself outside, and wait for the cycle to finish at a place where you cannot e.g cook at the same time. For me, the convenience factor is the most important.

Of course there are downsides.
