bipolar,euh4889,t1_euh1z2k,1563820516.0,Totally agree. I miss feeling that deep appreciation for simply being alive. It’s like the world is full of so many beautiful possibilities and you’re incredibly grateful to watch how your life plays out. I’ve been so hopeless lately and I need that perspective again.

I’m proud of you for choosing to report and standing your ground during that conversation, if that means anything coming from an internet stranger.

bipolar2,et87phv,t3_cabd8q,1562548846.0,I’m curious to know too because I’ve recently been considering attending as well. Are people experiencing depression and those with bipolar in the group together? Or are there two separate meetings?
bipolar,eswu4dx,t1_eswbd68,1562320734.0,I’ve read that that can happen. I think that was the trigger for mine as well. It makes me wonder though if my symptoms are just temporary since I only have mild bipolar and the trauma was less than a year ago.

I would feel bad asking my best friend if she’d be with me but I don’t want to just view her as my “backup.” But I also wouldn’t want to cut this relationship short and not let it grow to its full potential for no reason. Would it be wrong to ask if she’d be with me if I broke up with my girlfriend?
