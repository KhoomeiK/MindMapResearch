Would it be better to have a child, let it grow to 20 (definitely not proportional to a lot of agriculture but we will go with it), and then murder it or to just not have a child?  You would have to be insane to say the former isn't much less ethical.  Because this idea that we value the right of animals or people, who don't exist, to someday exist never crosses our mind until we decide we need something to justify our own slaughters. 

Nobody thinks of the decision to not have children as being on par with or possibly worse than the murder of an existing human of any age.  We just don't think like this because it doesn't make sense.  There are an infinite amount of conscious individuals who potentially could or could not exist.  With this logic, what's to stop someone from essentially turning their child into a slave?  If bringing something into this world is the equivalent of saving it's life then you should be able to beat your kid, emotionally abuse them, anything short of killing them and still come out of it a better person than you were before.  Sure, you screwed the kid up, but the old you would have had the them not exist in the first place, which is apparently somehow worse.

Is it humane to wait until it gets a little older?  At what point is killing something no longer abuse or cruelty?  

The counter argument to this would assumedly be that getting meat out of it is what makes the distinction, because it's no longer pointless.  Well, what exactly is the point of eating meat, for the people who can choose not to, that would justify something as grim as killing?

Some of the commenters make a slippery slope argument, which, while being a valid concern for the future, does not imply that there is anything hypocritical about the actions she has taken so far, given those two beliefs.  What's a little baffling, though, are the number of people who don't understand the concept of being against the animal abuse that results from contributing to animal agriculture, but seem to think vegans should have this zealous aversion to animal flesh even in situations where there is no reasonable indication that it could end up contributing to abuse.  

I can not be clear enough about this.  Veganism is not a religion.  There is nothing unholy about a dead animal.  Some people just don't like it when the living ones get hurt.  These are the actions of a person who doesn't want to do anything to hurt animals but also doesn't want to impose on anyone if the option is not hers to make. Her mother just didn't seem to understand that, assumedly because of the communication barrier.  Why are you trying to make it out to be blasphemy for a dogma that never existed in the first place?

But how does your family tell when their life is so hard that they would prefer death?   Most of the time it seems like people just put their animals down when they are no longer profitable unless they are officially ""pets"" and kind of seen as part of the family."
Cringetopia,fpycda1,t1_fpybe2o,1589001186.0,That's awesome.  What happens to them when they get old?  They just keep them around with no profit as pets?
Cringetopia,fpybb4j,t1_fpy9218,1589000384.0,"I mean, obviously your parents never bolt gunned you in the head and I hope to god they never anally fisted you but ok."
Cringetopia,fpxvf4y,t1_fpxu3s9,1588990373.0,Thanks for the unprompted concern but my family and I are very happy.  Not sure they're your kind of people though as they have no plans to kill me off once I'm not useful to them anymore.  Have a good one.  : )
Cringetopia,fpxue7s,t1_fpxggtw,1588989771.0,"I wasn't trying to negate your opinion.  My solution would be to just not do these things to animals when it's not necessary.  Most people don't need egg, dairy or meat.  They want it though and it's currently within their rights to have these things done to animals for what they want.  All I'm saying is that it's kind of hypocritical to do that and then make a fuss about what other people are doing to animals.  And let's be clear here.  We aren't talking about euthanizing the suffering.  We are talking about killing off animals once they cross the line from being an asset to a burden.  Some small mercies are inevitably going to come from systems like this but, at the end of the day, these systems revolve around profit and the small mercies are always going to be outweighed by the enormous atrocities.  All for some bacon and eggs."
Cringetopia,fpxtaon,t1_fpxs22i,1588989135.0,"And I hope you are forcibly euthanized when you can no longer support yourself financially, rather than retire, per your preference."
Cringetopia,fpxs908,t1_fpxend2,1588988531.0,At which point they are almost always going to be treated more like tools or products than pets.
therewasanattempt,fpxs335,t1_fpxhc9m,1588988434.0,"Lmao, what?  You are wild, dude.  Wild."
Cringetopia,fpxd6tv,t1_fpxc6lc,1588980365.0,"Yea, I'm not saying it's impossible to get certain things out of animals without causing them significant harm.  Just that it's so uncommon it's barely worth mentioning.  I understand milking cows can actually be a comfort to them.  It's more processes like anal fisting and constant impregnation I take issue with.  And I think if we're going to go ahead and just decide there's nothing wrong with killing animals as long as they're old it's going to be hard to get anyone to take your own objections to what they do to animals very seriously."
Cringetopia,fpxc3qw,t1_fpxaa2y,1588979740.0,"Pretty much anything that supports the claim that animals in similar environments aren't generally used like farm animals would be great.  I don't know much about goat farming but, just based on how similar this is to the shit people say to distract from the things we do to animals like cows and pigs, this is kind of hard for me to believe."
Cringetopia,fpxauq3,t1_fpx9zrt,1588979030.0,Definitely.  Almost every animal involved in egg or dairy production is at least mildly abused and ultimately killed.
Cringetopia,fpx9r3l,t1_fpwytru,1588978413.0,People who release them into the wild are dumb.  But people who actually rescue them save lives.
therewasanattempt,fpx94g7,t1_fpx04ou,1588978058.0,"People are definitely raped for breeding purposes sometimes and I doubt any non-human animal specifically has procreation in mind when they rape another.  It's almost definitely the kind of instinctual urges that prompts the non-procreation-inclined human rapists to do what they do.  Your arguments are getting less and less coherent the more you try to explain them.  

This is hilarious.  Seriously, where do you get this shit?  What youtube channel has you convinced you know so much better than everyone else about everything?  I really want to go down that rabbit hole.  Like, I literally don't even know how to respond to someone objecting so adamantly to the term violence being used to describe things like driving a fucking bolt through an animals skull.  Absolutely bizarre. 

You are not part of the natural order.  Your cubs aren't going to starve if you don't tackle a gazelle.  You have the choice to have a cow or a bean stalk killed for your food.  Whatever barely intelligible romanticisms you concoct about that choice or nature in general, that is a fact.  We are talking about the choice of whether or not to commit violence.  Just deal with it.  I'm sorry but this is pathetic."
