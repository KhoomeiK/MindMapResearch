antidepressants,fqib4e7,t1_fqhwub9,1589393623.0,"I‚Äôm sorry but under almost no circumstances should anyone ever go cold turkey on psychiatric meds, _especially_ unsupervised. I‚Äôm glad it worked out for you, but suddenly going off of psychiatric meds can cause a whole laundry list of problems, the most notable being sudden suicidal thoughts/ideation. Psychiatric medications affect your brain. You cannot treat them the way you treat other medications that treat more regulated parts of your body. If there‚Äôs anything you _don‚Äôt_ want to fuck with, it‚Äôs your brain. Trust me. 

Always taper your meds down, that way you can actually give your brain a chance to progressively adjust to the chemical changes caused by changing your standard medication routine. It makes the transition significantly smoother and your long term outcome better. 

Source: Have stopped taking various psychiatric meds over the years, some cold turkey and some by tapering. Tapering was always 1000x better."

Just did it again a week ago and I‚Äôm already starting to feel better. It always surprises me how much of a difference a small med change can make. An additional 50mg of my mood stabilizer last week was all it took to pull me out of a hard spiral. You might be closer to your ideal maintenance dose than you think. 

Medication is incredibly helpful and life-saving for many, but isn‚Äôt a permanently perfect solution. It‚Äôs normal to need changes every now and then, and people often need incredibly specific med combinations and doses to find/maintain stability. But I‚Äôve heard so so many stories about people adding one more med or upping the dose one more level and suddenly everything is smooth sailing. 

Just because your current meds aren‚Äôt helping enough right now doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre doomed, it just means that you haven‚Äôt found the right med for _you_ yet."

AreTheStraightsOK,foot1yd,t1_foornxv,1587945857.0,"I definitely agree on the issue of poor countries, the gender inequality in some cases there is unbelievably terrible. However, developed countries were in a very similar place in the not so distant past. I mean, women gained the right to vote in the US a little less than 100 years ago. Until the 1970‚Äôs they had to have permission from their husband just to be prescribed birth control. Over 90% of rapes go unreported due to the social stigma, and marital rape didn‚Äôt become illegal in all 50 states until 1993. So many of these issues are so incredibly recent that it‚Äôs no wonder plenty of older men still hold extremely sexist perspectives, and unfortunately these are often the very same men that are our family members, bosses, and government representatives. It‚Äôs very difficult to have legitimate equality when the people who pay you and represent you don‚Äôt believe in it. 

As for men‚Äôs rights, I believe that one of the primary problems men face is that people do not take their problems seriously. Plenty of men have to deal with mental illness, abuse, rape, emotional restriction, etc. and people view these problems as insignificant, and plenty of others openly joke about them. This is unacceptable, and it needs to change now. But that doesn‚Äôt negate the problems that women face, just the same as how women‚Äôs problems don‚Äôt negate the problems that men face. This is not the Oppression Olympics. All of our problems matter, and all of us deserve to have those problems rectified."

I‚Äôm not even talking about first person accounts and opinions, there‚Äôs legitimate statistics backing all of these things. I encourage you to read some non-biased articles on the subject, peer reviewed  scholarly journals are a pretty solid bet. 

I do have to ask though, do you think that men are on the whole better than women? This is a genuine question by the way, I really am curious about your opinion here."

AreTheStraightsOK,foolb20,t1_fonvrnu,1587941250.0,They did something similar to this to a female pedophile in the show Shameless and honestly I live for it
AreTheStraightsOK,fool6ll,t1_fooftll,1587941176.0,"This is true in my state too. We have something called ‚ÄúRomeo and Juliet laws‚Äù where if a couple are within a certain age range it‚Äôs okay for them to have sex when one is over 18 and the other isn‚Äôt. (The prerequisite might be that they were dating/intimate before the older was over 18yo, I‚Äôm not entirely sure.) So long as the couples‚Äô ages are within one or two years of the other, them having sex isn‚Äôt considered illegal. Which makes a lot of sense in my opinion, because it‚Äôs not like the second you turn 18 you mature immensely and suddenly understand all the nuances of consent and intimate relationships. 

Personally, I find the age of consent rule a little odd anyway. So if a person is 17 years and 11 months old they‚Äôre a child and it‚Äôs unacceptable to have sex with them, but once they hit their 18th birthday it‚Äôs fair game? It makes no sense. And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not saying that there should be no age of consent, I just think that it‚Äôs just as weird for a significantly older adult to have sex with an 18yo as it is for them to have sex with a 17yo. 

In my opinion, while the age of the younger party is definitely a very important factor, the bigger problem with adults having sexual relationships with teenagers is the imbalance of power and lack of equality caused by the massive age gap between the two. This makes it essentially impossible for a 25yo and a 15yo to have a healthy and respectful relationship, but in my opinion it also makes it very difficult for a 30yo and an 18yo to have a healthy and respectful relationship as well. And this inequality between partners only gets worse the larger the age gap is between the two, whether or not the younger party is 18+ and technically ‚Äúlegal.‚Äù

Meanwhile, this kind of unequal dynamic isn‚Äôt nearly as problematic between a 19yo and a 17yo, but in plenty of places it‚Äôs considered illegal while the relationship between a 30yo and 18yo is fair game, and frankly that just makes no sense. 

I don‚Äôt know, consent laws are a very complicated topic. I do think they‚Äôre absolutely necessary to protect minors from blatant pedophilia, but at the same time it does very little to protect young adults from the very same unhealthy power dynamic that makes pedophilia so terrible and problematic."
AreTheStraightsOK,fooj78g,t1_fooevkf,1587940027.0,"I think you‚Äôre misconstruing radical feminism as generalized feminism. On the whole, most feminists want men and women to _actually_ be equal (read: they recognize that men have disadvantages as well such as toxic masculinity and people disregarding their mental health/ rape/ etc. and work to rectify those.) 

Radical feminists are, well, radical. They take the legitimate beliefs of feminism and more often than not twist them to try and justify what‚Äôs really just plain misandry. These kinds of people really do lie in the minority, they just happen to be a very very loud minority, which unfortunately makes it seem like feminists as a whole are just as radicalized as they are. 

I don‚Äôt blame you for thinking that radical feminism is merely the newest development of feminism, it‚Äôs a very common misconception. However, it just isn‚Äôt true. Just ask any _reasonable_ feminist (aka: one that _doesn‚Äôt_ wish horrible things upon men simply because they are men.) We don‚Äôt believe this, and it‚Äôs immensely frustrating that radical feminists are twisting our beliefs to justify their hatred and as a result giving legitimate feminism a bad name.

You say that you support feminism that recognizes the common ground between men and women. This is what legitimate feminism _actually_ is. Radical feminists are not actual feminists. People who respect and recognize the problems that women face _and_ the problems that men face are actual feminists. And if this perspective aligns with your personal beliefs then it‚Äôs very likely that you‚Äôre a feminist too."
AreTheStraightsOK,foohogf,t1_foobuid,1587939148.0,"> Teenage girls are just as hormonal and horny as teenage boys, they‚Äôre just conditioned to hide it and be ashamed of their sexuality.

_Thank you._ I went through a pretty strong hormonal phase as a teenager and wanted to have sex pretty much 24/7 (which never happened because I also didn‚Äôt like to talk to people lol.) I‚Äôd heard plenty about how ‚Äúteenage boys want to have sex all the time‚Äù, but nobody prepared me for the fact that as a girl I‚Äôd be going through the same exact thing, and as a result I felt like a freak. 

Now that I‚Äôm an adult I realize that that obviously wasn‚Äôt true, but if someone had just told me ‚Äúyeah you‚Äôre going through puberty and as a result are having a pretty big surge of hormones that you‚Äôve never dealt with before, this is completely normal‚Äù it would‚Äôve saved me a lot of shame and embarrassment."
