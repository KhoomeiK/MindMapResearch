1. Muscle loss doesn't happen quickly.
 
In my experience, as long as your diet is in check (more about that below), muscle loss doesn't happen to any meaningful degree until around 4 weeks of not training at all. And even at that point, we're talking very tiny amounts of muscle being gradually lost at a slow rate.
 
2. Muscle is regained quickly.
 
I've said it before but I'll say it again, ""muscle memory"" is real and it's spectacular. Sure, losing muscle sucks (something I've experienced myself at times due to injuries), but the silver lining is that you will gain back what you lose significantly faster than you initially gained it.
 
3. Consume 0.8-1.3g of protein per pound of body weight.
 
Above all else, protein is THE key nutritional component when it comes to preventing muscle loss. Shoot for at least 0.8 grams per pound of your current body weight (use your goal body weight if you're very overweight).
 
4. Keep your calorie intake at maintenance (if possible).

If you were bulking and in a surplus, you're going to want to bring your calorie intake down to maintenance until you're able to work out again, otherwise you'll just end up gaining a bunch of fat.
 
And if you're in a deficit for the purpose of losing fat, being at maintenance would be more ideal for preventing muscle loss. So, unless your fat loss goals are more important to you than your muscle maintenance goals over this specific period of time, I'd recommend going back up to maintenance until you're able to work out again.
 
5. Keep sleep and stress levels where they should be.
 
That means getting 7-9 hours of sleep each night, and keeping stress levels to a minimum. This is easier said than done under normal circumstances, and the C-word sure as hell doesn't help matters. So, do the best you can.
 
6. Whatever you can do at home = better than nothing.
 
Even if you have no equipment at home besides your own body weight, whatever little bit you can do to provide some sort of training stimulus will be beneficial for minimizing muscle loss (and maintaining your sanity) during this time."
