I completely understand why you do, as there‚Äôs that stigma of ‚Äúboys don‚Äôt cry‚Äù but I assure you they do, and they hurt, they have feelings and they have every right to feel the way the do, and fu** anyone who says otherwise. You‚Äôre not less of a man because you seek treatment. Sending lots of hugs and happy vibes your way"

SwordAndScale,f0pjxhu,t3_d354pm,1568836242.0,"I wholeheartedly agree with you here.   
I think people forget that it is entirely possible to have two TOTALLY different opinions and disagree completely without either being a terrible person and without shitting on each others opinion. As you said, you don't shove your opinion down others' throats, they shouldn't do it to you. I swear those are my EXACT words sometimes!!   


Also, I like Mike for the very same reasons."

selfharm,eu5qvqv,t3_ceukgo,1563483344.0,"For now, don't worry about quitting for good. Take it a day at a time. An hour or a minute at a time if you have to. Remind yourself of the reasons why you want to stop. For me, it's my sons. Try to occupy your mind/time with something else. If you have a hobby, engage in that. Drawing or writing, knitting, watching tv. Listen to music, I listen to music that speaks to me and how I'm feeling at that moment and for me, it helps, but listen to whatever makes you happy. I don't know your age/home situation, but if you are able to, try to avoid the triggers, I know that is easier said than done if the triggers are at home, but if you can. Lastly, have someone to talk to that not only knows what you're dealing with but understands it and will know how to help you through the moments of weakness where you want to default to your way of coping (self-harm). I hope this helps. 

**You can get through this. You are strong, you are brave and you are worthy.**
