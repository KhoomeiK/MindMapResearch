Set up an email specifically for you guys to communicate that way everything is on record, papers/forms can be shared, and it’s hard to fight back and forth in an email.

Also, just file and get it over with. I understand wanting him to do all the work this one time but it you’re letting him have control over something you want. You’ll also know it was as done correctly. My ex-husband who doesn’t have BPD filed for divorce, I had him do all the paperwork to force him to actually take action for once in our relationship and he got some dates wrong just by accident. I didn’t think it was a big deal at the time but now that I’m trying to buy a house those simple dates have made a big mess of things.

However, it’s also about how the intelligent person is perceived. They could be the smartest, nicest person in the world, but if they are talking to somebody who is insecure and just a know it all who wants to be right all the time then they don’t stand a chance. The insecure person will always make the intelligent person out to be the arrogant dick because they can’t handle that someone might actually know something they don’t.

I just found out a house I put an offer in was rejected, which considering the times is both sad and good at the same time. Bleh, bleh, bleh, life sucks right now. 

But, life sucks for all of us. Your BF knows how bad it is, you don’t have to remind him every time you talk. Don’t ask him if he “has space” for you to vent at him, because trying to be a supportive partner he’ll say yes but honestly, he doesn’t want your burdens. He’s got his own. 

Btw, have you asked him how he’s doing?

What have you learned in therapy about dealing with hardships? Was it mindfulness? Radical acceptance? Facing facts? You need to go back to basics and self soothe yourself. Yes, it’s frustrating when it seems like we’re being disregarded by our partners but we need to look at ourselves to see if we’re being to much and what we can do for ourselves. As much as we need support, we ultimately need to take care of ourselves. We can’t place that on someone else. 

I was crying and grousing and complaining and my teen told me straight out that I was making him feel bad, then he jokingly told me to throw my bad vibes out the door, then gave me a hug. It made me realize how my attitude affects others and nobody needs that. He asked me to hang out with him and we wound up laying around watching Rick and Morty and making home made pizza. I had to let it go, i had to even if it was just for a while and get out of my mind for a little bit. And wow, what a difference it made. 

Our shitty issues will still be there later. Our worries and doubts about the future will still be there tomorrow when we wake up. All of these things are out of our control so for now let’s just enjoy the time we have with our loved ones (my kid is the only one I can hang out with right now!) and accept what is going on.

You have a couple of things going on here. First, have you ever been healthy and fit with a high metabolism and high energy? Whether you drink or not it takes a lot of time to build that up. And the larger and more out of shape you are the longer it will take. 

Then there’s PAWS. I think a lot of people forget about that. I’m 3 days shy of 5 years, PAWS lasted about 18 months. The “episodes” (I don’t know what else to call them) got less frequent and the symptoms not as strong, but it took a long time for my mind and body to even out.

I’m with the others that say volunteer. I do meals on wheels and sort and shelves books at my local library. Trust me, it’s hard to arrange the books by the Dewey decimal system unless you completely clear your mind of all your troubles. And both of those things are social enough without being completely out there. Simple chit chat and getting to know people little by little has been great. There are soooo many ways to just get out of your life for a few hours. It really helps. 

(Also, this will look good on your resume and will give you something to talk to your friends about)

Also, a suggestion from my therapist to me was to keep a gratitude list and a goals list. Keep it completely simple. “I ate a mindful breakfast today”, “I sat and read 3 pages of my book”, “I wore my cutest jacket today”, “I was on the elliptical for 7 minutes!”, those things may sound silly but keeping things lighthearted and simple is so nice in such a heavy time in life.

All these suggestions keep me sober and keep the dark clouds of depression off of me. These are things I *have* to do in order to keep living. You will find your way, good things will happen for you. Just keep one foot in front of the other and you’ll get there.

I’d wash them for her but I don’t do it right 😂"

I have no clue how we accumulate so much laundry but after years of being frustrated by it I decided to stop worrying why and just do it."

Frugal,fk71cxu,t1_fk5n5na,1583924599.0,I do this because i have found it gets any musty odors out of my clothes. Especially in the summer if wet towels or swim wear have not been washed right away. I put it in with my sheets because I feel like it neutralizes the sweat and body odors off of them. Could be I’m all wrong because I’m not a scientist but I’ve been doing it for years and have nice laundry.
