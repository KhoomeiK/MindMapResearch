Dissociation,fqhrq1u,t1_fqhr988,1589383084.0,I live in the UK and it has taken quite a few appointments. I first got referred to a psychologist by a hospital and she had to assess me but she had to refer me to people that are more specialised cause my problems are complex. Then I had a couple more assessments/screening with a new woman and I'm currently waiting to receive a letter detailing my treatment plan. Hope this helps.

SuicideWatch,finln5s,t1_fimcrbc,1582565572.0,Thank you a lot I went to this thing called CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health services) with my mother and spoke to this guy and it gave her insight into how I was really feeling so she knows how hard it is on me and I'm currently waiting for the hospital to direct me to a therapist or something like that. I have medication for my condition but it doesnt work fully (not well enough for me to go to school). There is one more option I can try but if that doesn't I genuinely dont see anything getting better. My school has been understanding and tried to make things better for me but it just still wasn't worth the pain of going. I can control my condition better when I'm at home because it depends on external factors (I have cholinergic urticaria so I just get this burning and needle like sensation all over my body when I become warm).  Of course if I get better before the next year of school starts I'll be able to re take the year but I dont really see that happening and I dont think I'll be able to re take my first year of sixth form when I'm 18 :(
SuicideWatch,fim8sdx,t1_fim7zu1,1582521545.0,Nah I've done my gcses and did pretty well. Im in my first year of sixth form ( or supposed to be). I dont smoke weed that much but the only reason I do do it is cause it's the only way for me to feel normal and be able to meet my friends. I can't without it because my illness is made worse when I'm around people (it is onset by a rise in temperature so anxiety and other things that would make a person warm).
SuicideWatch,fim7iwa,t1_fim762m,1582520439.0,I had to drop out of school (started back in september and I only went 3 times) cause of an illness I have and I'm only 16 and I dont want to end up with no qualifications but if I dont get better by September this year I wont be able to re take the year and I will be truly fucked. Ive been depressed af  since like June cause I cant do things that I should be able to do at my age like meet my friends and go to school (although the only time I can meet my friends is if we are smoking weed because it helps with my condition 100% when I'm high). I talk to my friends every day but I'm still really lonely

And there was this time where I didnt go to school for months a couple years ago and was listening to a lot of yung lean / dg the whole time and even though it was a pretty sad time listening to their music created quite a few good memories.

At their core, Fives fear being overwhelmed by the needs of others, and by extension, their own physical and emotional needs. They have a sensitive core which they aim to protect by isolating themselves from people, situations and certain aspects of themselves to avoid having demands placed on them.

ukdrill,fdhi17z,t1_fdhhecv,1578423074.0,"Hahaha yeah I see what you mean, S4LEM were inspired by southern hip hop and 'chopped and screwed' music so their songs use some trap elements and a slower bpm. $B, bones, yung lean, ecco2k, thaiboy and bladee all take from trap music as well so it makes sense. I used to be more into harder, louder and faster paced music a couple of years ago but I'm not that into it anymore except for all of the songs that I had already found then. Also I've heard some of machine girls music on some Instagram posts and I liked them but I haven't tried getting into their music yet. $uicideboy$ and bones make lots of different types of music (one of the people from $B was in a punk band). They have some heavy songs like 'I want to believe, ultimate $uicide, dejection) and bones has a lot of heavy songs as well ( blast zone, oxygen, sunnyday)"
ukdrill,fdhecfh,t1_fdhcm5h,1578420850.0,"I mostly just listen to music for the way it sounds and how it makes me feel rather than the message because the right music connects with me in a very strong way and just makes me feel really good in a way I cant describe properly.

The only UK drill rapper I know that has political lyrics is Drillminister, but bones has some political lyrics in the song ""ThatStuffWillKillYa"""
ukdrill,fdhavcx,t3_elekn3,1578419079.0,"This is really cute tbh. I like drill because firstly it just sounds good to me I cant really explain that much more but also, since I live in London, the people making the music are often quite close to me and this creates a connection that I dont get with other artists like ones in America. This connection is made stronger because the slang the rappers use is often slang I hear in my daily life. 

The other types of music I listen to is stuff like $uicideboy$ and bones etc that whole scene (they're rappers but I dont know what sub genre exactly). I also listen to stuff like bladee, ecco2k, thaiboy digital, yung lean etc who often have softer music (it's cloud rap/melodic alt r&b type stuff). Another type of music I listen to is electronic / witch house stuff like S4LEM, Crystal Castles, Kap Bambino. All of the genres I've listed are very different to drill (the most similar being the genre $uicideboy$ and bones belong to), although bladee has dabbled in the some US drill type songs (Psycho, 50SACINMYSOCIDGAF).

I've heard a couple JPEGMAFIA songs and they were okay nothing I'd really listen to again (except vengeance with Denzel curry and zillakami). 

Drill music is often quite fast paced and definitely hard hitting and intense. The music is also very serious. The lyrical content includes stuff like stabbing/shooting opps, chasing them, running from police, dissing dead members etc. I only listen to UK Drill so I'm only going to name some of the main / best rappers / groups from here:

Digga D, Zone 2, OFB, Harlem Spartans, ZT(the gang), Frosty, 67, 410, NPK, NitoNB

Also if you're worried that this music might affect his mental health, I cant speak for him but personally I know how it feels to have shitty mental health but the music hasn't affected me negatively.
Hope this helps you."
