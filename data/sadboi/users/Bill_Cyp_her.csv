depression,fkpwm3g,t1_fkpwbax,1584421656.0,"No, i love my family, its just I'm not happy anymore. I just don't want to be here. I feel like I never really belonged here, I'm a stranger to myself. I feel so detached, that it makes me so emotional. The world is a disaster atm, and I just am really sad. I thought things would be better when I got older, I'm starting to believe there is no better. I tried looking at the world in a good light, I just can't anymore. I've tried to escape reality but that makes it worse. Because when I'm not distracted, I have to face reality. I don't know if this makes sense, I just have no one to talk to"

depression,fdpk7kp,t1_fdpjflf,1578630892.0,"I just haven't been okay for a long time. Everyone thinks that I'm always happy. I even got class clown for yearbook, but I wish I could show them how I really feel. My life sucks, probably not as bad as other people's. I just can't talk to anyone because they have their own problems. My parents would probably just be more disappointed or think I'm dramatic. Which I honestly probably am. I would kill myself if it wasn't for the fact that funerals are expensive. I thought about running away, but I don't want my family to try and spend their time looking for me. I'm grateful for them, but I never felt like I belonged there. I was adopted when I was 3, so I really never felt like i belonged anywhere. I sound like such an ungrateful brat. And I just want to die."

Its either an actual law irl or a law in the cartoon I can't remember it."
