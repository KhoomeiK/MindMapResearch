ADHD,fqthc2j,t3_gkr6ci,1589639007.0,"Hey, this happens to me verbatim every couple of weeks. I pick up a new hobby and become completely obsessed with it until a couple weeks later when I start to lose interest. Then,  something else captivates me and I'm left with all the materials for woodburning when I really want to buy a bread machine. 

This used to really mess me up inside because I would feel guilt about all the abandoned hobbies just sitting and collecting dust and all the money I wasted trying all these hobbies that I would ultimately abandon anyways. 

When I told my therapist about this, she asked me why I hated doing this and why I felt guilty about doing all these things if they made me happy, and I told her that in a perfect world, I would just stick to one hobby and be great at it forever. She asked me if that's what _I_ wanted or if that's what everyone expected of me and I kind of gave it a second thought. I determined that in _my_ perfect world I would get to try everything and jump from hobby to hobby without guilt or shame because everything is exciting to me.  

She encouraged me to view my hobby jumping through the lens that that is who I am, and not shame myself for what I am, but realize that these hobbies I give up are never really gone (I pick up old hobbies every once and while when I need them or they become interesting again, even if it's a couple years later) and that exploration into new hobbies isn't necessarily a waste of money because exploring new things make me happy. In essence, trying a bunch of new hobbies _is_ my hobby. And that's okay.

 I realized that I would probably never be able to stick to one hobby forever (that sounds very boring anyways),and I know it sounds really corny, but accepting myself for being different rather than hating myself for being flawed has been the best thing that's ever happened to my self esteem.

 You sound like you are different too. That's okay. We're not like the people that can stick to one hobby forever, but that doesn't make us bad. Do yourself a favor and never feel guilt about who you are. I know it's easier said than done, but I wasted my life trying to fit a round peg into a square hole (and then hating myself for not fitting!). Realizing that I am ok the way I am has set me free. I hope it can do the same for you.

 PS: If you'd like to try to limit spending on new hobbies, something I found helpful is finding hobbies with many different subgroups like woodworking, it keeps the interest flowing with the same set of tools."

depression,f3a2qhs,t1_f39za59,1570760440.0,"Feel free to ask questions, I don't mind. I think it gradually faded away around the time I lost weight (around sophomore year of college). It helped me with a lot of confidence issues and I felt like people treated me better. I think feeling comfortable in my own body helped me more than I could have ever imagined. I stopped dressing to hide my fat and for the first time since I was a kid, I didn't dislike how I looked. That was also around the time I made some friends. That helped a lot too. After I hung out with them, I didn't need that extra boost of happiness my fantasy life gave me because I was already happy. 

Of course, after gaining it all back and isolating myself from my friends, I'm pretty much back to square 1."

I feels like no one wants to deal with you, like they tell you to open up to them but the minute you do, they get uncomfortable and want to push you onto someone else. I know they just want me to get help, but it feels like I can't tell anyone I'm close to without upsetting them. So I don't anymore. I'm in therapy, but I still feel so alone, like I can't talk to anyone but my therapist about my issues because I'll just make everyone else worry or not want to be around me. They just don't get it.

Sorry for the wall of text, just wanted to rant."
