However if you're hosting a book club and using a closed group or the like on Facebook to hold the event, I can see where things get sticky. I don't think it's the best option, but social media is one of those things that is both intrinsically brilliant and maniacal simultaneously.

I would share if you have a very close friend who you might think could support you in this time. It's frustrating and weird and scary, but nicer when there's someone to talk about it.

She would constantly comment on my appearance, force me to change clothes, would buy outfits that would be way too big telling me that I was way fatter than I could see and that I am an embarassment to her (she has always been morbidly obese, too). I am bigger now because of meds, but when I was a teenager was much smaller. I remember asking if I could get some new dress clothes for a job I was working. We went to New York and Company and literally asked the employee helping me browse if she could just gather the store's largest clothes because I was in denial about ""needing"" to shop at Lane Bryant because of my size. The woman handed me a medium blouse. That fit. My mom argued with the woman and berated her, screaming at her because she wasn't doing what the customer always wanted. 

I also had to have many conversations with her about touching. She will ask to snuggle and try and spoon while standing. I'm 24. She will touch my hair and smack by butt and it's deeply uncomfortable. I eventually just told her I will NOT allow it. I purposefully will sit across a table and will always have my fiance with me and very close. I would seriously establish a strong boundary with that."

It's devastating. She's told me I owe it to her, and that I wouldn't even be able to adequately care for my child being so addled by my schizo brain. (I have a way more functional life as a person with schizophrenia than she has ever had). WHen I was very ill she told me she wished I would get pregnant while in the psych ward, which I was in and out of, so they would take the baby and give it to a good mom like her. Recently I expressed my concerns with her relentless begging for me to have a baby, and explained that my medications pose a really big risk to fetal development and going off them for extended periods of time poses a serious risk for myself and the life I've created. She then said that she thought it was best since I would do a horrible job on or off meds because I am so crazy. Like....... what

Either way, he is extremely odd and very recluse. He lives with my mom and she resents him so badly. She brought him in to live with her (and me) when I was a teenager. She never says a kind word to him at all. She calls him stupid and acts like he is a burden. He doesn't ask for much except conversation, occasional trips to the grocery store, and being able to watch star trek. When I was actively hallucinating and psychotic my BPD mom would beg to help me. There were times that very basic things were a struggle, like going to large stores like Walmart or the mall. She would bring me to these places and I would often become really spacey and breakdown a bit, leading her to tell me to ""knock it the hell off"" saying I was ""faking it"" and that she couldn't bElIvE her once successful daughter was a ""crazy schizo fuckup"" that she ""nEeDeD"" to take care of. It was awful. I feel that many folks with BPD need that dependency but only at convenience to them. Truly, she needs someone to dote on her. Eventually when I graduated cum laude from undergrad, she would tout how her schizophrenic daughter championed the odds because of her support. It was really strange and still hurts.
