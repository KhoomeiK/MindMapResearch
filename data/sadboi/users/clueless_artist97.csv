\- Spier Chardonnay ([LCBO # 487181](https://www.lcbo.com/lcbo/product/spier-signature-chardonnay/487181) ) : Really good for an un-oaked, young, chardonnay

\- Château des Charmes Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (LCBO # 81653) : Ontario VQA. Smooth, good oak, good slightly chilled (found it more flavourfull). 

\- Cono Sur Bicicleta Viognier (LCBO # 64287) : very well priced. Smooth. Reminds me of oak aged chardonnays. Great buy for the price.

\-Silver Point Sauvignon Blanc (lcbo# 187013) : New Zealand. I've yet to find a better Sauv. Blc from NZ.

\-Columbia Winery Chardonnay (LCBO # 462804) : California. Don't let the state or price fool you. This chardonnay is a real treat."

Whoa! Surprised by this one. Picked this one up at LCBO for C$ 13.95 today. 

Wasn't sure what to expect -- I'm nowhere near an expert but my last Chile Viognier I enjoyed was the ""Cono Sur Bicicleta Viognier"" which I found much more smooth and easy-drinking. This one I found more acidic, less smooth mouthfeel (pardon my lack of knowledge -- I'm learning!).

Nose : honey, lemon-lime

Plate : high acidity, stone fruit, peach -- I want to say 'spicy-ish on the finish'. Good minerality.

Looking forward to feedback and comments!!"
