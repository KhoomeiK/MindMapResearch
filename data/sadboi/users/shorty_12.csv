AmItheAsshole,fcxc7iy,t1_fcw1bc7,1578058920.0,"this comment is on point.

i dealt with an addict brother throughout all of my teenage years (he is 7 years older than me). he is now about a year and a half sober. when i say he was a nasty person as an addict, i truly mean it. but at the time, i just knew that wasn’t my big brother. i had written off my “real” brother as dead and whoever he was at the time just was not him, so i disconnected from that.

a lot has happened since then and we are slowly rebuilding our relationship. anyone who has been through AA or NA knows this has to be a slow process and they should never force it.. so if they do force it then create boundaries and back off. mind you, i wasn’t as quick as my mom and sister to accept him back into my life. i am glad that i did now, but if you told me i would have done that 4 years ago i would’ve laughed in your face and said “yeah right!!” 

he has come a long way and i’ve discovered that he doesn’t even remember most of what he did to me and our family, but he is willing to hear about it because he wants to know how he acted. he wants to know how disgustingly he treated us because he has to live with it. i’m beyond proud of him for taking accountability and recovering.

obviously there is no pressure to reconnect and your feelings are 100% valid!!! i just wanted to tell my story in case you or someone else needed to hear it. i truly wish you the best of luck in your life and i hope that you can work through the trauma this has caused you. <3"
