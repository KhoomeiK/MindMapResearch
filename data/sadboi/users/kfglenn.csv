But the problem with cutting it to zero is they can't lower it anymore, so if things get worse, well, we're fucked. The economy is in crisis right now, so lowering it is reasonable, but cutting it to zero is extremely dangerous, especially if things continue to get worse."

Demanding they be like their characters any way in real life is unreasonable and not the point of an actors career. If they were cast, it's because they understand how to portray homosexuality in a way the casting director, director, and writer hoped it would be presented."
