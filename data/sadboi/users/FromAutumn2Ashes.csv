StarWarsBattlefront,fr0me1u,t3_glzbi1,1589800624.0,Try Han or Iden. You can debate whether or not they are the best but I think they’re at least some of the best .
StarWarsBattlefront,fqzdlyd,t3_gloxpu,1589765150.0,I wish
StarWarsBattlefront,fqzd9xh,t3_glqhzx,1589764951.0,"That’s why I mostly play Showdown. For whatever reason, people just don’t use their brains when they play this game."
StarWarsBattlefront,fqzcew2,t3_glrmsi,1589764436.0,Hell yeah
StarWarsBattlefront,fqz9ul0,t1_fqyfunq,1589762911.0,Yeah because I love this game.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqxofs0,t3_gliyoo,1589735443.0,Suggestion: EA bad
StarWarsBattlefront,fqx73xy,t1_fqx5lem,1589727258.0,AI flame troopers kick my ass when I try to play Rey. And honestly I’d consider myself a pretty good Rey usually playing very aggressive and pushing objectives hard in Supremacy. Idk what it is man.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqwo2fn,t1_fqwhq7y,1589711613.0,Hey dude you’re pretty cool. I bet you’re the life of every party you attend.
HeroShowdown,fqvj6dj,t3_gl3e01,1589678415.0,Cool idea I love this mode.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqvj3ep,t3_gl6g7n,1589678363.0,I don’t think so but honestly it hardly matters. You hardly get more credits from winning vs losing. I do know that you keep all your XP tho.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqt97je,t3_gktre0,1589633657.0,Nothing.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqt94ca,t3_gkttgf,1589633588.0,I absolutely LOVE that one where the two default FO Officer clones chat to each other. Never gets old!
StarWarsBattlefront,fqsjeo3,t3_gknpac,1589608944.0,Padme... I wish.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqsj99a,t3_gkogb5,1589608818.0,Not accurate I cried much more about this travesty.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqsj3zi,t3_gkorwc,1589608701.0,Just be confident. Imo if you’re constantly running away with Boba you’re doing it wrong and just wasting everyone’s time if it’s an HvV mode.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqsiyaa,t3_gkou9f,1589608572.0,"A mix of your team being bad, Republic heroes/reinforcements being strong and easy to pick up, and you not being very good yourselves if I had to guess. 

I would say just leave and search again if this happens again and hope for the best. I’ve won as the Separatists using Grievous but i feel like it’s a lot easier to carry teammates with Anakin or Obi Wan."
StarWarsBattlefront,fqsijdf,t1_fqsigya,1589608237.0,I’m about to get it on PC for the mods honestly so I’m kinda excited lol. You only get rage messages on PS4 usually only in Hero modes.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqsiejn,t3_gkpg3c,1589608129.0,Lol never realized people cry about them since I play on PS4 and there’s no team chat.
SoulCalibur,fqshyef,t3_gkkhyz,1589607774.0,I know that guy lol
StarWarsBattlefront,fqphg8h,t3_gk3ty5,1589546493.0,Because they’ve realized their vision with the game now.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqphbni,t3_gk4duq,1589546403.0,Rebellion. He fits just as well on any other faction accuracy wise to be honest but it would just be cool having Mando vs Boba to me.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqp6jzm,t3_gk5l1j,1589536822.0,No it was completely intentional by the developers
StarWarsBattlefront,fqni3ni,t3_gjwhed,1589495249.0,This was suggested a while back. It won’t happen. Wish it would tho for console at least.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqngeo1,t3_gjvrsh,1589494382.0,Honestly I’m just disappointed support is over. I know it’s out of Dice’s hands but what the fuck there’s so much more that could be added to this game. This is the type of game that should be supported for years and years imo.
battlefront2,fqlc3y6,t3_gj3zir,1589453555.0,The other thing I notice often is BF1 models in screen shots for the Rebellion and Empire despite them not actually being accurate in game.
SoulCalibur,fqlbz6x,t3_gjgu5n,1589453428.0,Well sure why not? I’m pretty much down for anything. Still really wanna see Setsuka and Rock at some point tho.
starwarsspeculation,fqlbnrj,t1_fpxf90x,1589453122.0,Hey man... we’re gonna see TEMEURA MORRISON again in Star Wars!!! Personally idc who he plays I’m just so excited lol.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqhvu07,t3_gj0o7u,1589385484.0,I lost it when you fucking smacked Kylo.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqhvklq,t3_gj15tg,1589385355.0,I love playing him in Hero Showdown lately.
StarWarsBattlefront,fqf6zn4,t3_gienkh,1589319763.0,I can imagine a lot of amazing things in this game. Fuck EA.
StarWarsBattlefront,fq9yjfw,t3_ghloyv,1589209540.0,Console master race
antinatalism,fq9nhbj,t3_ghd70i,1589202949.0,Who are these 29 people and what is your secret?
StarWarsBattlefront,fpsfw1r,t1_fpsfrl5,1588872784.0,I was really hoping for more starfighter assault content personally. I feel like flying in Anakin’s Actis class would’ve been so much fun for example. Also Rebellion tanks would’ve been nice.
StarWarsBattlefront,fpsfmlj,t3_gfasnm,1588872658.0,Damn he got you good.
StarWarsBattlefront,fpsfdwq,t3_gfauc6,1588872543.0,To be fair while the original is pretty much my favorite game of all time it was definitely not “as complete as it could be.” I’m disappointed that BF2017 was cut short too though.
dissidia,fpqyozv,t1_fpqixf1,1588836357.0,Bye!
StarWarsBattlefront,fpj2jrj,t3_gdqyip,1588654810.0,It’s how it’s always said lol.
SmileEmptySoul,fozo17j,t3_g762mw,1588193875.0,Agreed I love this band.
StarWarsBattlefront,foznxx3,t1_foznsvj,1588193829.0,This is where the FUN begins!
StarWarsBattlefront,foz9wwo,t3_gaf3v8,1588187124.0,This is pretty tough to read but all I know is this guy just said Matt Lanter’s Anakin voice is atrocious.
StarWarsBattlefront,foz9jr0,t3_gaf9s8,1588186948.0,tik tok
StarWarsBattlefront,fovau0d,t1_fova2yz,1588098232.0,"I agree with most of it except for one thing. For me, in a Star Wars game, I think having someone more iconic would be the top priority. Besides, Krennic and Ahsoka for example have plenty of potential to be unique anyways. 

I’ll be honest I’m really satisfied with this game and enjoyed just about everything they’ve done post launch but I can’t pretend that seeing Jyn and Krennic or Ahsoka in this CT wouldn’t have absolutely floored me."
StarWarsBattlefront,fov9kd8,t1_fov93nr,1588097631.0,"I’m not as disappointed as the original commenter but you realize they specifically wanted Jyn and Krennic... not Ahsoka? Like they literally said it in their comment.

Anyways, pretty sure Ahsoka, Jyn, Krennic, or anyone would’ve been more fun than the BB units. I don’t hate them or anything but come on lol. Still love this update for Scarif tho."
battlefront2,foqbayp,t3_g8imt7,1587989122.0,Basically what everyone else said. I wish there were more. CIS is so much fun.
SoulCalibur,fof7t99,t3_g6yg8x,1587728911.0,I know people didn’t like the Star Wars characters but I’m a big SW fan and was pumped for TFU at the time so Vader and Starkiller in a SC game were everything to me.
StarWarsBattlefront,fo8ofcg,t1_fo8o91p,1587600579.0,"Awesome it’s nice to find another fan of them out there.

Sounds good I will take your advice next time matchmaking screws me."
StarWarsBattlefront,fo8n453,t3_g6b7ae,1587599826.0,What advice can you offer to others who have been or may someday be in a similar situation has you to help cope?
FinalFantasy,fo3kv3i,t1_fo3kovp,1587488596.0,Yeah me too. I’m fine with either way but I tend to prefer linearity with some branching paths.
FinalFantasy,fo3i5rl,t3_g5hvgv,1587487305.0,A little bit but if you don’t like Wall Market I feel like you just won’t like the game that much. That was my favorite part lol.
FinalFantasy,fo3hx79,t3_g5glsy,1587487194.0,Yeah and it’s not a bad thing imo.
StarWarsBattlefront,fnyz8af,t1_fnyz4ud,1587381127.0,"Okay but have you read anything I said? I’m not trying to be rude but my point is they literally do not have to make Jango Fett play like Boba Fett.

Don’t get me wrong if you just don’t want Jango added that’s perfectly fine but you seem to be missing my point or just ignoring it."
playstation,fnyys8z,t3_g4kd9o,1587380675.0,Guys you’re not going to believe it but this morning when I loaded up my PS4 I was greeted to this super strange message from a player I had never met before. Really weird name too.
StarWarsBattlefront,fnyyo3s,t1_fnyyhs4,1587380553.0,"I want Ahsoka, Ventress, and Windu the most but how would Cad Bane be more different than Jango? I’m down for either but both Cad and Jango could be designed with an almost identical move set."
StarWarsBattlefront,fnyy575,t1_fnyxwqd,1587380023.0,His blasters are different and they could give him a cable ability that stuns people or something. That’s already two off the cuff ideas that would differentiate him from Boba Fett. Not to mention all of the other gadgets he uses outside of Attack of the Clones. I’m not saying they should definitely add him but use your imagination a little. Maybe make him fire his missile from his jet pack or something too.
FinalFantasy,fnyxw3c,t1_fnypyhe,1587379757.0,Yeah I agree Barret is fucking badass!
StarWarsBattlefront,fnyxrit,t1_fnyvtsa,1587379626.0,"Actually he wouldn’t be. However, they will probably add Cad Bane over Jango first which I would be fine with either way."
KingdomHearts,fnshhfd,t1_fnsagmn,1587221716.0,What have I done?
FinalFantasy,fnohz89,t3_g2z052,1587125601.0,Strength through perseverance man. You won’t get those gains by having somebody else work for you. Don’t you wanna be as strong as Jules one day?
StarWarsBattlefront,fngwykd,t3_g1kvhq,1586948034.0,Looks like someone let air out of a balloon.
FFVIIRemake,fngwwu5,t3_g00vje,1586947984.0,Not letting me scroll down to see Barret. Maybe it’s a mobile bug.
Tekken,fngwrrz,t3_g1e9ea,1586947837.0,How about Josie crying option for my fellow shelf stockers?
FallenOrder,fngwkw2,t3_g1gkjr,1586947642.0,What if in the sequel Oggdo instant kills you if you try to fight him and you just have to run away as fast as you can?
FinalFantasy,fn9paeo,t1_fn9kvvs,1586780938.0,Can you explain? I’m out of the loop but always figured Nomura was pretty cool.
SoulCalibur,fn6gtnr,t3_fzlm7i,1586698885.0,I had played it on PS2 since I was a kid and only recently tried it on dolphin emulator. You GC guys were lucky to have Link lol.
KingdomHearts,fn6gm79,t3_fzqpu1,1586698727.0,Love it nice job.
FinalFantasy,fn5ewxa,t3_fzo0rx,1586663069.0,So far it’s all taken place in Midgard for me but some of the slums offer slightly new scenery at least. The future games will have much more I think.
FinalFantasy,fn5emxq,t1_fn5ekwy,1586662866.0,maybe... I don’t know Barret is just so awesome lol.
FinalFantasy,fn5ejxn,t1_fn5e0jv,1586662804.0,Oh okay I understand. I can agree with that I suppose.
FinalFantasy,fn5dp69,t1_fn5dgl9,1586662179.0,Actually I really liked Coded on the DS... :(
FinalFantasy,fn5dje9,t3_fzop81,1586662063.0,Kind of wish it happened at least every now and then... or just have Barret do it every single time. I would pay money to have Barret do it after every fight lol.
StarWarsBattlefront,fn13xdj,t1_fn13vlj,1586554302.0,true im on board
StarWarsBattlefront,fn12rx8,t3_fyof1d,1586553637.0,y
SoulCalibur,fmzey78,t3_fy9nd6,1586518031.0,Wouldn’t know... nobody even plays him in my games lol. All I remember about him is getting bodied by some of his basic string during the beta/launch of the game. Good times. Haven’t seen him in a few months now maybe that’s just my luck though.
StarWarsBattlefront,fmz8kfb,t3_fyb9st,1586510654.0,The same reasons anybody gets mad at a video game in general pretty much lol.
StarWarsBattlefront,fmz8iho,t3_fybmux,1586510595.0,I wouldn’t mind them removing it as it is and making a new way to parry with a cool animation or something but honestly I enjoy it the way it is.
StarWarsBattlefront,fmz8esl,t3_fyc8ju,1586510480.0,You can adjust sensitivity and stuff like that but honestly it’s just like anything. Best way to get better is to just practice. Find a sensitivity that feels right and just play.
StarWarsBattlefront,fmyd0gm,t1_fmycvlv,1586483313.0,Yeah true. Just something I guess. I grinded Anakin and Vader to 1000 over weeks of playing during my free time because I just haven’t really had any other progression to work towards in this game. I hope they are some kind of rewards tied to leveling eventually.
StarWarsBattlefront,fmyc2hf,t3_fy27r5,1586482706.0,At least something for level 1000 would be nice.
StarWarsBattlefront,fmyaz5w,t3_fy50mg,1586481993.0,"It just slowly derails, getting worse and worse as each second passes."
FallenOrder,fmsk2m8,t1_fmrz58u,1586357020.0,"The Force Unleashed didn’t have complete dismemberment. While I like TFU more for personal reasons, both games are great and I have to call you out on being a blatant liar."
StarWarsBattlefront,fmorbcz,t3_fwhk1t,1586266805.0,alpha
MortalKombat,fmi6shn,t3_fv5k6g,1586103582.0,Well... I might play this game more if Mileena was added. Still pretty bummed they skipped her but at least we got Jade now.
SoulCalibur,fmhhqxy,t3_fulb3f,1586080647.0,Idk man I’ve been learning her recently and have been having some success. Thinking of making her my main now.
SoulCalibur,fmhhkjn,t3_fuywsq,1586080434.0,As I am someone who hasn’t labbed him yet... I’m just sitting here like wtf did I just watch lol.
SoulCalibur,fmgj649,t3_fv0s6f,1586050230.0,You said you practice the combos for hours which is a sign you might be practicing incorrectly. Make sure you practice defense. Learning each character’s strings and how to GI are important. Movement is also extremely important in this game. I would argue these defensive options are much more important than learning combos in this game.
StarWarsBattlefront,fmc1y0n,t3_fucsgt,1585937381.0,I picked villains. It’s not like I can’t win as heroes but I just feel like the villains have more good options.
wowthanksimcured,fm7qgxv,t3_ftjlyf,1585834511.0,Huh never realized. I always figured ships just sink the second they touch the water.
StarWarsBattlefront,fm3v7bp,t3_fsv1cq,1585738251.0,I loved that lightsaber dueling game with the arrow keys and the tower defense one.
StarWarsBattlefront,fm3uxvw,t3_fsuduj,1585737976.0,I always wondered why they made R2 the pawns instead of rebel troopers tho.
KingdomHearts,fm11tdt,t3_fs1a8m,1585670425.0,I loved it overall. I have to admit the story was pretty much exactly what I expected but the ability to play as other characters and the data org fights were amazing to me.
KingdomHearts,fm10b6o,t3_fs44d9,1585669630.0,What makes this even funnier to me is how they heal for no reason causing berserk charge to activate yet again. Poor guy. Glad you beat him at least.
depression,fm06rih,t3_fs7813,1585646952.0,"I’m glad it got better for you. Unfortunately, I don’t think it is a one size fits all situation. It is possible for it to get better for one person and remain terrible forever for me."
paragon,flzn1lo,t1_flzgbum,1585627781.0,A TOP SIX COMPETITIVE TEAM????!!??? HOLY SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
StarWarsBattlefront,flxl0e5,t3_frtdg4,1585584951.0,Thanks for letting me know.
StarWarsBattlefront,fludth5,t1_flu7kpx,1585500615.0,Yeah to be fair the AI is actually harder than the average BF2 player at least for PS4. At least they will actually hit you and block with their saber.
StarWarsBattlefront,flud4uz,t3_fr7u09,1585500230.0,"If they do content after Scarif, I would bet a lot that she is next."
StarWarsBattlefront,flqddfk,t1_flqcnub,1585389917.0,"On the contrary, I think everyone is entitled to their own opinion."
depression,flgxu9n,t1_flgx0hn,1585152386.0,"It’s probably been around that long for me too. Some people have told me therapy and medication helped them and I just wish it were so for me too. 

I’m not sure man... I’m sure it can get better but it just feels like flipping a coin at this point. I don’t know about you but I’m just gonna keep trying and hope for the best."
depression,flgwxj3,t3_fos7ch,1585151890.0,"I can’t. Their happiness isn’t more important than yours unless you make it so. Like... I think I’m just sticking around for my dog. She’s my best and only friend that’s still around. My only other best friend was my other dog and she’s gone now. 

It’s not really selfish... it’s just a choice the way I see it. I don’t really attribute any negative or positive characteristics to the act itself personally. Just a shame that we can get to this point where we feel like our lives are so far gone that it would be easier to just cut our losses and run rather than go backwards and try to fix things. 

Best of luck. Life makes us feel shitty enough as it is. No sense in feeling worse pondering whether or not we are selfish or not anyways. I can see the arguments for both ways I guess as it is just a matter of opinion but you can probably guess which side I lean towards most."
depression,flguue2,t3_fosb2f,1585150747.0,Hasn’t for me... I hope it will for you man.
