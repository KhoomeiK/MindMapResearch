socialskills,fr2vqmy,t3_gm4c5n,1589844828.0,"Oh this was definitely me at one point. Was abused at home a lot. Abused by boyfriends blah blah blah. Because of what happened I became what family desxribed as zombied. And when I ran away from home for a better life, I found myself confused by the world. Everything I understood about the world shattered and I felt so completely lost and alone. I had no idea who I was. Was I ever anyone? 

Point is, what you're going through fucking sucks. But it's not the end. Life is cycles. It's seasons. 

Think of this as a winter season in your life. Hibernate. Meditate and self reflect on your relationships, memories, how you handled things, things you liked. Are there things you don't like anymore? Why? 

Then think: ""what would help turn my winter into spring?"" What are things you were interested in but never pursued? Books you want to read and shows you want to watch, buy clothes totally different. Dye ur hair crazy and then regret it. Talk to yourself. Talk and talk and talk till you feel insane. Then do it again.

 Life is about attitude. Yes, it hurts, and I want you to know that you gotta feel that. Fucking cry dude. That shit sucks. Cry, yell, punch a pillow, take a long shower. Realize no matter what you were born to be loved unconditionally, no matter who you are or aren't. 

You have personality. You know who you are. There's an inner child inside that wants to love, learn, and explore. Let them. Take this as an opportunity to learn everything about who you are and what you want. 

Personally I started out using tarot pick a cards on YouTube to help guide me. As silly as it sounds, it can actually be really helpful, and you don't need to see it as ""spiritual"" if you don't want to. 

Love and light to you. üíñüñ§üíñüñ§"
dating_advice,fr2aw3r,t3_gm2g61,1589834137.0,"I'm fucking feeling this one man.

I had a guy I totally crushed on. We just hit it off and not just romantically (tho he's a total babe). It was as if I met up with an old friend and nothing had changed.

 Because of past trauma I self-sabatoged. I thought ""how could this seemingly really good guy like me? He's playing me. He's planning on hurting me.""and pushed him away. He was angry, hurt, confused. I apologized profusely... maybe too much. I wasn't desperate or scared of him leaving-- I was horrified at myself that I was rude to him. Looking back on our convos it was all in my head. Trying to repeat a cycle of abuse that already ended. One he wasn't apart of. 

It was horrible and disgusting of me. I respect and understand why he blocked me. I apologized one more time and never bothered him again. I tried to bury it away. ""It doesn't hurt. We weren't together. It would've never worked anyways."" 

Two months, therapy, and moving out of state is what it took for me to come to terms with all my abuse. Two months to realize I made a big mistake. He was interested in me. He was kind. He wanted to get to know me. I've never had that before. And now I lost it. 

I'm crying now as I write this. I just wish I could talk to him one more time just to make sure he knew he didn't do anything wrong. But it's disrespectful of his boundaries to do so. 

I just know I missed out on some real love. The kind I've been searching for. I feel it in my bones, and soul, and core. I'm accepting I miss him. Accepting I'll never get to see him. But gods, it fucking hurts. 

Sometimes I give in and allow myself to daydream about us together. Being domestic and loving. They get out of hand I think ""wow we could have a big beautiful family and adopt kids and create art together and just be happy."" I feel wrong for doing so. I know I shouldn't fantasize about someone without their permission. But it's hard especially with all this quarentine. 

Man I miss him. Fuck I'm stupid.

Imagine: someone perfect and magical comes into your life, sweeps you away from all the madness of whatever you're going through, but now you're going to hit another road block: You're depressed. You're hurting. You're traumatized. mentally ill. You can't communicate properly. You can't think or feel in a healthy way. Relationships edge on toxic, if not become this way.

You need to HEAL. Not cope. Not be saved. HEAL. Nobody will ever be able to do that for you BUT YOU. It's easy to say ""I can't."" I know. God I know. But you're far more resilient than you realize. Everyday you live is a day you are strong. everyday YOU SAVE YOURSELF. 

Everyone is hurting and healing. It's okay to want to be saved because you're human, and humans NEED love, and nurturing, and kindness. Not to be cheesy, but if you want to be free and live happier, you have to give yourself love, nurturing, and kindness. Especially if you're in a bad situation currently.

 It's not about ""how can anybody love me if i don't love myself?"" it's ""how can i choose healthy boundaries, healthy choices, find a happy life, and healthy loving relationships of any kind, if i don't believe i deserve it?""

Id honestly place a bet that she purposely proposed in public so that you would feel forced to say yes, and then if you tried to ""discuss"" is later she would've tried to manipulate with the fact that you said ""yes"".  Either that or shes big fucking dumb.

Your mother is choosing her partner over her child and that just isn't a good mother!!
