depression,fqovtic,t3_gk067l,1589526398.0,"My mom once put my cat/best friend down after she put him on medication because he wouldn't walk on her dirty and cold floors.  She said his liver was failing, but he was great, just messed up because of the antidepressants she put him on.  We would go for walks every day. I never got to say goodbye. He just wasn't there when I got home to take him for a walk. Every time I walked along our trails, I bawled.  Then I picked up World of Warcraft. A tiger and I fought and I couldn't put it on myself to kill it. I succumbed to it killing my mage and I wept because it looked so much like my cat. I imagined it was my friend coming back to play once more. Now, if I ever want to see my cat again, I can just go into that world and be with him once more.  

It's nice having surrogates for friends, especially in these tough times.  Video games are a perfectly healthy way to help ease our loneliness and depression. I hope you make lots of friends and get to show them around the little world that you create.  It's not sad or pathetic that you found something beautiful in this world and it happened to be digital.  Maybe one day you'll get to see someone singing on the waters edge in the outside world.  If you want to make a real friend, that plays Animal Crossing, and likes to sing, then I suggest looking up Ayytrae on Twitch. She'll make your day better."

It got me thinking about all the failures I've had and after bouncing back I'll find myself back at the bottom.  So I ended up here in the depression forums.  I'm not manic or severely depressed, but in a daze.  I'm 34 and graduated with a degree in Psychology, but after years of concussions in football I find myself useless in this world.  I lose a lot now, but I try to find the fun in life as a born again loser.  I had to talk with my parents a lot and its nice to know that when my life isn't at its best that they are there for me.  We went through some tough times: alcoholism, abuse, and neglect from almost all parties, but we talked about it all a lot and it's reassuring knowing that they are there when I need them.  If yours are willing to help you then you aren't a burden on them. It's just like how you aren't a burden on those that are reaching out to you today with their hearts and minds.  It's a better world with you in it and you just need to start noticing that a little better.  

I'm currently using my failures to help make me better.  I'm focusing on things and not assuming or being overly confident. I'm trying to be understanding  and I'm lucky that others can be the same.  Every little thought is a practice at making healthy habits and healthy thoughts lead to a healthy life."

She lives on in you and with you.  Do what she would do and what she would want you to do.
