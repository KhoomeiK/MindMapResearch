My current partner explains things for me and will write them down if he knows I'm going to forget, he doesn't get mad at me for forgetting. Exasperated some times but we talk.

I ended up creating a private blog to record all our convos or write down anything he said because if I didn't he would use it against me.

A lot of us on Reddit actually *didn't* vote for those that stripped voters rights or voting access away; due to us either not being able to vote, not knowing where/how to vote, not having accessibility to vote or yes, voter apathy. 

But there are people our PARENTS voted in who we can't vote out ourselves. There were laws changed when we were CHILDREN that we had absolutely no power/voice to change them. There are districts where they have been so gerrymandered that their vote ultimately is a drop in the well to keep the status quo. So many rights have been stripped away that it isn't just a 'vote and it'll fix it' issue. Look at Georgia's gubernatorial election; blatant voting fraud, blatant voter suppression and still Kemp BARELY won via cheating.

When you have to keep prisons full or risk a deficit, many are thrown in jail for minor offenses or face trumped up, circumstantial charges that ruin lives. And the prison population began to drastically rise in the late 80s, early 90s due to increased pushes in all major cities and at a federal level. 

Essentially they traded slave fields for prison cells and convinced people that they were 'helping' by sticking people behind bars with no chance of rehabilitation.

MadeMeSmile,fnam73t,t1_fnaic68,1586799909.0,"Oh goodness the poor dear. So, the easiest way to help is to always go gentle. When detangling and brushing/combing natural hair you want to make sure the hair is completely saturated with water. I use a spray bottle most days or the showerhead if I have time to dry. Next you want to always ALWAYS brush it with some kind of conditioner in it. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, any regular conditioner will do, and depending on the thickness of her hair you can dilute it if necessary. When brushing out thick hair after it has been saturated with water and conditioner, section out areas and always always start from the bottom.

The way I do it is I use a [wide tooth comb](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/6Bb1uCku7XnuFjM4_ABYWtgRaKDZWCvKYwiEoXzyRJ1DBrGpZBgNADgRw3s9PWaUUlhusife8yBl_hCuwTpPJ2X5-XGCxrtp8YicwzSd6azNPnoB2Zrdlr55LybVVYWK2-MNbmyt0xSxidGPsIIDYk7JboEvyA), and gently begin combing upwards. When you come to a knot you gently work the last tooth of the comb into it and gently work it downwards until the know comes out. Then you start from the bottom again until the knotted area is all gone. You repeat this until the section is done. When you're done with a section you can make a [chunky two strand twist](https://hairmotive.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Chunky-Flat-Twist-Out-natural-hair.jpg) and hold it with a non-elastic band. You repeat this for every section. Now, those sections don't have to be perfect because when you're done detangling everything, I'd suggest doing a nice deep condition. You can put in [cholesterol conditioner](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/2ab5a4fe-b245-444b-ab73-7d65ccc86a0f_1.1c77afe8d1bf97499ed1c1c77dc633f0.jpeg) and an oil of your choosing (Coconut, jojoba, all natural olive, shea butter) when you've detangled an entire section and then braid it up and leave it in overnight or however long she'll allow. Then if she wears it overnight, in the morning you can wash out the conditioner and gently take out each twist from the bottom up with a little bit of water to make sure they're not stressed. With natural hair you are always working from the bottom up. When that is done you can put in a cream leave in and an oil.

&#x200B;

But the biggest thing is to be gentle. Check in with her while you're doing this, never yank on knots and if you're up for it, find an [ oil](https://www.target.com/p/carol-39-s-daughter-goddess-strength-hair-38-scalp-oil-4-2-fl-oz/-/A-76578294?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=google_pla_df&fndsrc=tgtao&CPNG=PLA_Beauty%2BPersonal+Care%2BShopping_Local&adgroup=SC_Health%2BBeauty&LID=700000001170770pgs&network=g&device=c&location=1018614&gclid=Cj0KCQjwm9D0BRCMARIsAIfvfIaBaw7svrn3rHJz-JEKW3uTaDwV6loU2M54gZDRfl9rjWLl_--EGg0aAo3VEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) you can place on the scalp that soothes it. The big thing about natural Black hair is that it needs moisture and oils help lock it in. Sorry if this was a bit long but I wish you tons of luck!

Edit to add some popular, easy to find brands;

Cantu- Cheap, can be found both in Walmart and Target as well as Amazon. Great products for the price

Shea Moisture- Recently changed their formula but still really good, especially for beginners

Olive Oil- I know it's not the best but it can be found everywhere and works pretty good in a pinch

Carol's Daughter- More expensive but the products are great and smell really good"
Coronavirus,fnaknu7,t1_fnajxgy,1586799152.0,Millennials are overwhelmingly Democrats or Independent. Like near 70% in some studies. These comments should be targeted at our parents and grandparents.

We want change and are actively facing voter oppression due to the fact voting isn't considered a right but a 'duty' that we aren't given off for. We're trying our best to paddle in this situation and it sucks that more often than not, there's some European or Canadian literally gloating and mocking us for not having better healthcare.

AskReddit,fmx6mm1,t3_fxwi7z,1586459413.0,"I was home alone with the cat, my boyfriend plays poker for fun but worked late so he would occasionally be at the casino late. I have anxiety so I'm always checking doors and such to make sure they are locked, our apartment is on the first floor so it especially weirds me out. So after another sweep of floors and windows, I'm relaxing, watching YouTube vids and texting friends when I suddenly hear this scratching at my porch door. It's a big glass door but curtains cover it so I can't see a thing.

My heart starts beating a million miles a second as I slowly edge away from my couch, rush to the kitchen and grab the broom. What I thought I was going to do with it, I had no idea but I was going to do *something*. So I hear the scratching intensify and I'm texting my boyfriend with one hand, holding the broom with the other and tiptoeing towards the backdoor suddenly unsure if I locked it or not. Suddenly there's a thud against the door and I screamed before hearing my cat give the most ferocious hiss of her life. Thing is, I couldn't see my cat at all. So I'm frantically looking around for her when I see this lump right near the porch door.

I call my cat's name four or five times, I hear her yell to acknowledge me but she doesn't move. So now I'm thinking, 'oh great, now I really have to go over there or risk losing my fur baby'. So I'm trying to steel my nerves and not cry and I push the curtain back and see...

But that night when I asked how he could do this, I was his fiancee, he told me 'stop saying that like it means something!' I had gotten semi-used to his gaslighting/emotional abuse but that broke me.

So, I went back to our apartment, downed a bottle of Burnett's and followed it with sleeping pills.

dragonage,fmx2ww1,t3_fxt9fy,1586457509.0,"While I can see I'm in the minority here, a Dwarf Warden's story holds a lot of fun potential. I'm personally biased towards the Aeducan line because you are a noble who is cast out due to a lie. Your father is dead, your trusted companion is lost and you are literally thrown into a maze and left to perish. But you survive and are forced to go to a place you never wanted to see and are terrified of. The surface. 

For a Dwarven Warden background, everything can be introduced through fresh eyes. The turmoil not only being familial but with the fear of the unknown world on top of being a brand new Grey Warden. Both Dwarven backgrounds are essentially stumbling infants compared to the other races where they know the Couslands or they know of the mistreatment of mages or how city elves and Dalish are different. You literally get a fresh slate with them!"
