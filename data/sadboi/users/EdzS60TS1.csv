ptsd,fe5njye,t1_fdwfd6c,1578871839.0,"Honestly it's fine, unfortunately too many gang members get overlooked as a ""Chavs,  and Thugs"" aswell as we as a people get looked at as ""Evil and Cold"" however, many people don't realise that were not cold we care, top reason for a young person to commit gang activity is out of necessity, it is only getting harder to make money in this world. My favourite quote of all time is from Tupac, ""We was young, We was dumb, but we had heart."" Unfortunately it's getting horific in the UK for some reason. 

Im sorry to hear about your friend, he seemed like a good kid. I have lost 7 of my close friends lately, all of them true gentlemen, and I would class them as brothers. It's really really sad, and sometimes I would go to get in the shower and look in the mirror to see my scars from the violence and would cry because I would ask myself why I survived but they didn't. 

I'm sorry my comment confused you, sometimes it gets hard for me to type as I have mini flashbacks whilst typing and I cry. I have quite a similar story to be honest, My closest friend Luke, has always been the same as me. We'd walk women over the road, we'd carry shopping bags for the elderly, we'd help pregnant women and walk our female mates home at night. When I moved away and started getting in more and more crime, he went to uni and stared studying. Unfortunately, a few months ago he was chased on a night out and stabbed multiple times and thrown in the river. Unfortunately his body was found a few days later."

ptsd,fdw4ipe,t1_fdw2qop,1578754952.0,"I had the flashback whilst frying an egg this morning, I'm an ex member of a street gang in northern England. I was young, I still am. I have witnessed a lot of domestic violence including that against my mum. The guy who did it was a lot older. I was lost, scared, I felt worthless, it felt horrible to not be able to do anything to help her. I'm sorry if I triggered anything, but I was just wanting to share my story. 

Everyone thinks that gangsters are all horrible people and do everything we can to hurt people, but sometimes people don't have a choice."

It was honestly horrible, me stood there, blood allover my tracksuit, I was only fourteen. Ik how it feels to feel broken and worthless. Good job, Uncle Reddits for our backs."

ptsd,f3dbxo4,t1_eu8zu75,1570834499.0,"I agree to the fact that I caused pain to others and there families, but all I can say on behalf of myself and those who I was In the situation with is that we were surviving, it was us or them. A thing in common between myself and a lot of other young ex members and even those that are still members nationally, is that we all grew up with bad or no father figures. I personally was abused by my father, he would also neglect me and leave me on my own with no food or money for months from the age of 9. Therefore the only way to eat was to steal and drug deal and fight etc. And as I got older when I returned to my mum I suffered more abuse from her ex partner. Leaving me with PTSD both from father figures and gang shit. Then as I started to realise that my mum was struggling to feed the while family I had to do what I had to do. So although I do not regret being a gang member, I do apologise deeply for my actions during that period. And I pray to whoever listens that those effected by my actions forgive me.
Just my personal thoughts."
