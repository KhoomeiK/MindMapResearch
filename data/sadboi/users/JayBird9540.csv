Your point is that the rich people give nothing to society, but the family produced jobs and income for not just the poor family. 

What exactly did the poor people do for society? Destroy the lives of the maid and driver? 

It really does boil down to your own personal views on how society should work. 

I do not believe that people that are wealthy are responsible for anyone else but themselves, they should pay their taxes and thats their only obligation to society. Anything else is not required or should be expected from them. If people that are wealthy decide to go out of their way, good for them, but you’re in the wrong to say they have a parasitic relationship.
