AskAcademia,fbfja1k,t3_ed17at,1576811961.0,"It's not right to offer them leniency in grading especially if final exams are already finished. 

I think your role is to point the students in the right direction and suggest that next time they talk directly to their professor (whether you or someone else) early in the semester and seek medical treatment or be prepared to accept the consequences. They should understand the syllabus and academic expectations. If they don't meet the expectations, then that's on them. 

I might sound insensitive, but to put in context: This is coming from someone with mental health issues, is a caregiver to two people with serious chronic health problems both mental and physical, and many more work and family responsibilities. To say that made undergrad and grad school challenging for me is a HUGE understatement. But I've never used any of those things as an excuse or asked for special treatment/consideration. 

There have been a times where I know that I haven't done my best on an assignment or sat for an exam unprepared. Regardless of whether it was because I had the flu, was up all night at the emergency department with a family member, played video games instead of studying, or because the combination of my anxiety and depression exacerbated my procrastination and made it impossible to do ANYthing, I always understood that if I didn't meet the expectations then I'd get a bad grade and that was my problem and not the professors. 

Is extra credit even a thing in college? I thought that was only during high school. Either way, if you decide to do anything I think it's more along the lines of giving the student an incomplete and working with them over the next few weeks to work out a plan for them to complete the work or repeat the course. Check to see how your university handles incomplete coursework."

Your FH is a smart guy. You guys went from homeless, broke, and relying on other people to get you to/from temp jobs to owning your own home, being steadily employed, and having some money in savings.

Rings don't matter. Fact. Especially when you're looking at marriage. He's thinking that he'd like to set both of you up to be financially successfully before taking that step. It's a LOT better to go into the marriage in good financial shape than not. 

If you're really getting the sense that yes pushing the date back on purpose because he doesn't really want to get married, then time to either accept that or move on (move on). But if he's just taking it slow and trying to be smart about it then dude is a keeper. There's no rush. Trust me on that."

PublicPolicy,eq40lgr,t3_bwzc6s,1559766692.0,"Depends...if you know what you want to do and the grad degree will get you there then it’s not a bad idea to just go straight through. Otherwise, I recommend working for a couple years first. I took a 4 year break between undergrad and grad school part 1, then I took a 2 year break before starting grad school part 2. There are a ton of benefits to working...like experience and money! And if you have loans from undergrad then I caution against going to grad school to take out more. Take some time to pay down your debt or save up money.

Edit: sorry just saw you want to do an MPP. In that case I definitely suggest working first. I have an MPA and now and working on my MPP and having that work experience and exposure to the field definitely gives me an advantage in the classroom over my peers who are coming straight from undergrad. Whatever you do, good luck!"
