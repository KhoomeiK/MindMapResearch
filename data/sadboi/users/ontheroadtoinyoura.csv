I was depressed for fourteen years until I googled ""why am I so unhappy?"". I know it's dumb, but it opened my eyes to possibilities in improvement. We have so many answers, Medieval Kings, Marthin Luther King did not have as much knowledge available as us but we don't search for it.

You can get better. No. You will get better. Tell yourself that."

Listen more, be genuinely interested in her and the response to her will come naturally. Also, don't be afraid of lulls in a conversation. It doesn't mean that it's getting stale. This could give her an opportunity to get to know you in return. If you focus on having fun, you wll naturally figure out ways to make the night fun. I suggest you work on your body language. SMILE AND EYE CONTACT will get you far."

But it's up to us how we perceive it to be honest. You either get consumed by it or you dedicate your life to improving it. I love that you have so much passion for our environment, imagine if we had someone like you as one of our leaders.

Also, the media plays a part in all this BS. Social media is covered in too much negative articles as it attracts more clicks than positive ones. 

Get around the news but don't spend too much time on it. Focus on what you can today to help it, if it's out of your reach it shouldn't bother you."
socialskills,eysptdz,t3_cyd773,1567407707.0,"Hey buddy, great to hear your progress. It usually takes one comment or one event to change our states drastically. 

What I do to get back to that incredible state is remembering that one comment/event again and remind myself of my worth. For example, I'd be really shy when talking to girls, so I recall times that I had amazing conversations with women, and the thoughts in my head were just that, random thoughts.

I believe this process of thinking is called limited beliefs. Look them up for more info! Good luck!"
AskReddit,eyspk48,t3_cyffwp,1567407369.0,I start to think about what I could do to be successful. But then the thought scares me and I end up playing video games or browse reddit.

socialskills,eut0euc,t3_chfmt4,1564017258.0,"Simplest thing is a shift in mentality. Understanding that people are as self-conscious as you are. Most people focus more about how others perceive them than their thoughts on others . They may notice you, but they're not necessarily judging you. And there are those who judge maliciously, but no point in considering the opinion of someone like that. 

Sounds to me you're an interesting,talented fellow who likes making friends and has a great family. Most people don't have that! Be proud and confident within yourself!"

socialskills,ethbxo1,t3_cboc9y,1562811313.0,"Hi there mate, I admire the passion you have for meeting people because some people have an abundance of friends and prefer to stay alone. The years of loneliness have caused you a lot of frustration and you have created an association with making friends to your own happiness.

Start to be more grateful with what you have, your family and work/schoolmates. If you're happy within yourself, other people will naturally gravitate to you."
