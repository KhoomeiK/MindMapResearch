The sitting president would like you to think he's not here because the media is unfair, but that's not true. Trump rarely likes to pass on the opportunity to broadcast himself, no matter how much he complains about the coverage. He might have you thinking that that he's not here because he's already won, but in many states across this great country, the polls tell a very different story.

No, ladies and gentlemen, the real reason that the president is not here to debate me tonight, is because he is a coward."""

Take a step back, and realize: 

\- this is a human being, like you

\- human beings all deserve basic rights

\- This girl is just crying because she lost her family. That's sad. 

I get that we do have an immigration issue - but what has been scaring me lately is that empathy is seen as a ""liberal"" thing, and not just something that should be practiced by everybody, everywhere. The government should be just as responsible for maintaining the well-being of these kids as they are for detaining and controlling illegal immigration.

But hey, maybe I'm just a SJW having a knee-jerk emotional reaction.

EDIT: I'll rephrase ""stay with your children"" by just saying they should be allowed to *communicate* with them.
