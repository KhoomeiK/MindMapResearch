Recently I got a gaming laptop, I would've liked to build a desktop but I travel a decent bit and didnt want to keep taking it apart, loading it up and it taking up a lot of space when traveling. It's a predator helios 300, and recently I've been playing Warhammer 2 and the temp of the cpu spikes whenever I run it. Usually hitting 89c, and today just hit 90c for the first time. I'm not too tech savvy, but the specs for the CPU is an Intel i7-9750H @ 2.60GHz and the graphics card is a Geforce GTX 1660Ti. Everything runs smooth, and I sit at a constant 60fps, sometimes dropping to around 55, but normally staying at 60. Never had any issues with lag in game or anything, I'm just getting worried about how hot the things gets, it sounds like it's going to just shutdown or explode when playing this game."

After that if I get them again and I pull up and see it's their house I'll pull around the corner and wait a little before taking it.

You need to take care of yourself, and while yes we all need to go to work, we all need to take time to heal. If you dont stop and relax, you dont know what it could cause in the future. Addiction? Self inflicted pain? Sometimes taking a day or two off makes a world of difference. If you think about going back to work does it cause a sense of dread or uneasiness? If it does, then obviously theres something wrong. You feeling like you've made the wrong decision leaving is just something your body does. It's the same thing as when someone buys a lottery ticket when the prize is a ridiculous amount, and checks their numbers and sees that they've lost. After they see it they put it down, and move onto something else. Later on they'll most likely say something like ""let me just double check, maybe I read the numbers wrong?.""

Anxiety,fgpivk0,t3_eznps6,1581005682.0,"I just talked to someone that does the exact same things. Obviously doing these things isnt healthy, but I know that you couldn't help doing it. This is what happens when you get overloaded and have no idea what to do next. Your body kind of gets a mind of it's own and feels the need to take over, same thing as when someone gets angry and throw, hits, or breaks something. Emotions are a powerful thing, they can control when we eat or sleep even. If this feeling starts to overcome you again you need to just stop wherever you are. You'll know when its happening because the same feelings will start to rush over you. Just stop and get inside your own head, and divert your own thoughts to something else. Put on a show, play a game, make your favorite thing to eat, start running a bath, do something that'll take all your focus off what you're thinking and put it into something else. It cant be something like throwing garbage away, because theres nothing much that comes after it. It needs to have actions that follow, or provide you with something to think about further. Cooking requires multiple steps and is time consuming, running a bath makes you get all the clothes you'll need after along with washing yourself. Not to mention a hot bath will help relax muscles and tensions, and might make you mellow out in the process of sitting there. While you're in the bath put on a show on your phone and focus on that, or play a game. Then after you've relaxed for a bit, think about what was upsetting you before. Is it worth hurting yourself? There is always a solution or work around. Just find one that works for you for everything that bother you. Dont want to go to the gym? Push ups are some of the best exercises you can do, and require no equipment. There are many different positions to do them in to work your body. Then once you do these for awhile, you might want to try out other things. Ease yourself in if you feel overwhelmed. Maybe buy some dumbbells, buy some protein powder, or get a yoga mat. Dont push yourself to the point where you feel the need to hurt yourself, because in the end that's all you'll be doing. Turn that feeling into something good, maybe you'll find your next hobby? You're the only person that knows what's best for yourself. Just focus on making your life better, and soon it will üòä"

Hold your¬†breath¬†to the count of ""three.""

Exhale slowly through pursed lips, while you relax the muscles in your face, jaw, shoulders, and stomach.

Do this about 10 times and just relax. Get something to eat, I would say the best thing right now would be some kind of chocolate snack. Cookie, brownie, candy bar, ice cream, something of the sort. Then make a warm cup of tea, dont make it hot because you want to drink it now. The sweetness of the chocolate mixed with the warm tea going down will help relax you. There are times when everyone gets overloaded and people understand. This is all it is right now. Sometimes stress can lay dormant for awhile while other times you can feel it build, but no matter what it'll always come out if you haven't found a good release for it. Some people snap, other just feel broken, some just want to sleep it off. You just need some good R&R, and focus on nothing but yourself. See if you can get a day or two off, and just focus on nothing but what makes you happy. Dont think about anything but the present for a day to bring yourself off this anxiety spike, then the following day think about what you can do to reduce the anxiety on a daily basis. Sometimes it's as simple as sleeping an extra twenty minutes or taking a short nap. If you start getting stressed out again, just get up and walk away for a little. Remember that when a storm starts, it'll always come to an end. If you're going through anything it's okay to talk to someone, if you have nobody that'll listen or you're afraid to tell people in your personal life, my door's always open. I deal with this kind of stuff all the time, and nobody will judge anything you say. Just remember you are the way you are because of reasons leading up to this. It's not your fault, but only you can make it go away. Just try to relax a bit, dont push yourself, and remember that you've been strong enough to put up with this, so you're strong enough to end it.

I know it basically has the same permissions as an app like snapchat or Instagram, but at the same time I use those for my own personal pleasure and enjoyment. I dont want or need this, it's more of the company wants me to have it, and is basically forcing me to use it or risk my employment. Not to mention that since it has permissions to my phone, the app could be recording every conversation that goes through it, whether it's for work or personal use. Nobody will know for sure. If it was optional then yeah, I'm all for it. But being mandatory for every driver just seems like theres more to it then just ""letting the customer have a better experience."" Not like we've gone how many years without it just fine ü§î"
Dominos,fgdehnv,t3_e2gckb,1580681637.0,Yeah now my store is talking about getting it. My boss keeps saying it's only when you're working it tracks you and when you call someone it shows up as dominoes instead of your personal number. Anyone have like a solid understand of what the app does and tracks?

ww2,ffavn4y,t1_ffao1xo,1579745543.0,"Hey to each is own. I was looking for a specific make with matching parts and that's what I paid for. If you want to pay $600 for a mismatched rifle then good on ya, at least you show an interest in parts of history. $1,000 wasn't that much to me when I seen the rifle and whenever I shoot it i definitely feel like I'm getting my money's worth. Not to mention people are always asking to hold it and shoot it, so it's nice to give people a chance to fire something that they otherwise may never have been able to but have always wanted to."
ww2,ffamzs0,t1_ffa5q68,1579739758.0,"Sorry I'll believe what I want. I talked to a couple of different people about certain batches, and while yes theres a chance it wasnt there, I'll still go by what the papers show. Regardless of if it was or wasnt, I'd take paying extra for this over a junk CMP one that is mismatched üòÅ"

ww2,ff7ymob,t1_ff31tff,1579661479.0,"Funny story, when i first got my nagant i was really new to buying guns. I had a 9mm beretta for a carry and that's it. Super easy to figure put the ammo to buy. When I got the nagant I bought I think 7.62x41 or something, all I knew was it was meant for an ak47. I thought ""eh, its 7.62 itll work."" Lemme tell you. It didn't."
ww2,ff5j8sz,t1_ff4quk3,1579595440.0,"Check the serial number of the rifle you're looking at, a lot of the times there'll be a batch it was made in and you can find where it was shipped to. But you also need to remember that a lot of them were reworked because of wear and tear, so you might but a barrel from ww2 but a stock or reciever from korea or Vietnam. Especially if they were early war. Mine was made in 44 and I lucked out and got an all original Springfield."
