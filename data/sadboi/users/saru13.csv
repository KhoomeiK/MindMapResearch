I'm not sure sbmm has a yes/no solution for average players. Improvements could certainly be made, but the fewer platforms to pull players from and more skill pools you separate players into, the fewer players are left to fill your pool, resulting in substantially longer wait times. Still with no guarantee that you are in the top of your group in terms of skill.

People rarely play any game for ""new content,"" unless it's already there. Planned, like for sure.

Mario is still fun, and Fortnite is still fun.

My comparison to super Mario twins is extreme, but there is also the same size difference between spoiled, and entitled. Spoiled is getting what you want. Entitled is expecting it beforehand. Very few are whimsically conversing about that one time they ran a guy over with the atk. Most people say epic is trash because the storm killed them. ""Mobility is garbage, I've bitched for 30 days about mobility, and they still didn't unvault the atk. I'm out. Can I have some upvotes?""

They gave us a new engine, they told us a while ago that it would be February, then they told us it was later in Feb to it's current expected date. I don't expect them to tell us what went wrong, or even what they did to fix it. They aren't charging by the month. They are charging by the season.

depression,f4damw8,t1_f4clvjq,1571540049.0,"I have been on several medications, but currently self managing without their aid. I have seven children, and when my issues manifest in full, I become very volatile and self destructive. Suicide has never been a thought that made it very far, except while on medication. Other side effects include zombieness, sexual issues (these are ok, just harmful to my relationship), visual and auditory hallucinations, mood swings, anger, irritability, and exceptionally short fuses. On occasion, I have made it far enough to go to the hospital begging for help. ""I need to be somewhere, monitored while on medication for my safety. I am a danger to everyone around me. Please!"" I even told them I want to kill my ex, notably the root of my first depressive episode. They reply with asking if I have had suicidal thoughts. Well? That apparently disqualifies me from anything other than another test run of a medication that fails miserably. 

I have been self medicating with alcohol and marijuana. These 2, at least give me a little sanity, slowing my mind and bringing me to a point where I can block a chunk of the shit in my head. Cbd doesn't work, supplements accredited to anxiety relief such as ashwagandha, as well as others, don't either.

While medication appears to be exceptionally difficult to find with any type of success, I also feel as though the system, and it's doctors have failed me as well, which in my state, makes it very difficult to trust them. For instance, lexapro, I believe is a starting point for depressive and anxious folks, for the reason that 9/10 people have good results (possibly requiring an adjustment in dosage) with zero side effects. The tenth person has no relief, and still no side effects. Me? Oh, I hear conversations on the other side of the wall, or see a car run a light to smash into the side of my vehicle. Real as fuck. Almost caused me to crash. So I guess the statement of 10/10 is skewed a bit.

Only that one of us has never made the other do so.

Back to you, dear. I am physically stronger than my wife, but would never seriously say, ""I will always be stronger than you."" Odds Re he has about 5 years before that is likely an untrue statement for your case. 

He may want you to avoid birth control for a multitude of reasons. The one that sticks out in my head, as a man, is that if you cheated on him, and weren't careful, it would be very easy to identify.

Of course he treated you well, bought you flowers,  etc. If he started off telling you how to live your life and kicking you out of bed, it would have never come this far. That is how brainwashing works. Hook em, then it's on. Does his kindness continue today? I assume not, since you only stated ""when we first started dating."" 

You will take the fall for every failure in your relationship. You will be left at home wondering what it is you did wrong, calling him a million times, him not answering, until you realize this too, is your fault while he is gone, just doing whatever comes next today.

The truth is, he probably doesn't care about you like you think he does. This is why he might leave you penniless. Just like he left you naked and hungry this morning. Trust me, he has felt fine today. Empowered even, by not answering his phone when you called. Probably even smiled as he slid to decline.

Someone else can manage your medications, if you truly can not.

Find someone closer to your age. Try new things, and experience life, and all of it's  firsts together, instead of following orders blindly. Build your own empire, discuss what you would like to do today, and for the rest of your life. Agree on things that are a blast for both of you. 

Your relationship does not sound healthy for you, however it sounds pretty great on his end. You do what he wants, and he does what he wants. He gets a young sex toy to do his bidding, despite having hired help. 

In addition to this, there is a good chance (even if your relationship does work out), that you'll be a widow at 40, and he will leave everything to his kids, and you with nothing.
