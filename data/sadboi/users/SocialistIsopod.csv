Guns weren't widely used, especially by the military, until the late 15th century when the Ottomans made them a regular part of their infantry. Every ""gun"" before the 15th century is widely considered to be a hand-cannon, not a gun. In 1411, the true pistol was made, and even then, it still used a wick. What made it a pistol was that it could be fired with one hand. Hand cannons needed to use two hands.  Since the medieval era is usually classified to have ended in the late 15th century, to around 1507, guns wouldn't really be accurate in a game about the medieval era. Mostly because they sure as hell weren't used often."
