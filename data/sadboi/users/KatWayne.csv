SJSU,foi5uib,t3_g78m3u,1587779335.0,"I went to Foothill College against my will. It totally sucked (or so I thought at the time) but I would have spent close to 7x as much at SJSU to just fuck around and take random classes to see what I liked like I did at Foothill. I couldn’t pick a major even after 11 quarters so I chose a random one and transferred to SJSU (big mistake- stick around longer if you must to find something you actually like). Turns out I hated my major and needed to change after arriving as a Junior, so I did and it wasn’t a huge deal except for the fact that SJSU is completely incompetent in doing literally anything (including losing my application to graduate 4 times) but I got it changed. So while I wasn’t undecided, I was definitely unenthusiastic about the major I entered with. If I were undecided, I’d definitely go to Foothill (or in your case, any jc of your choosing). TLDR: SJSU is a complete shitshow (sorry to anyone whose proud to be a Spartan) at almost all times and a JC is your best bet for saving money and probably a better experience. :)"

SJSU,fiwpp8u,t1_fivjj9r,1582797004.0,"I disagree! I tried really hard to learn at sjsu, but the professors here suck. Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure they’re doing the best they can but I really feel like I didn’t learn anything…? Anyway, got me degree and got out. I guess that’s what matters"
