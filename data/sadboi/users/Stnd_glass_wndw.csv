science,fpbtcy2,t1_fpbad8y,1588478217.0,"It’s usually diagnosed on a manual differential. The bacteria are seen within the red blood cells, and red blood cell inclusions are always abnormal. Considering the PE’s I can almost guarantee multiple CBCs (Complete Blood Counts) and differentials have been done. Anything abnormal is flagged by an analyzer and is then observed under a microscope where the organism would then be seen. Also the fact that a Hematologist has been on the case, he/she has most likely personally looked at any strange observations under the microscope.
If you truly are curious I would suggest antibody testing.

It’s hard to tell from the picture if it’s irritation, fungal, or bacterial. Doc should be able to know within the day if it is an organism and if you need specific antibiotics/antifungals.  They should be able to have you on something within the day if they have a quick lab and it’s something simple.
HPV usually infects the genital, scrotal, and buttocks area but rarely travels down the leg like that unless it’s Varicella-Zoster related AKA chicken pox or shingles. As a person who has personally had both, it doesn’t look like that to me, plus there is usually a significant amount of pain and lesions in a larger area.

Edit: HSV not HPV... different viruses, still both STDs lol"
medical_advice,fle5dx4,t1_fle3r4h,1585077909.0,"For some clarity on those tests: 
TIBC = total iron binding capacity (tells you how well your body is storing iron)
Transferrin is also a storage protein for iron so it’s levels can tell you body uptake/utilization
AST/ALT: ensure there is no liver inflammation that could be affecting RBC production
CRP: indicates inflammation. Iron deficiency can be seen in patients with chronic inflammation.

Edit: transferrin is not a storage molecule, it’s a transport molecule. Sorry for the brain fart. But it will tell you if your body can even use the iron supplements you’re taking."
medical_advice,fle52ws,t1_fle3r4h,1585077746.0,"There is research that some hormonal birth controls may affect iron uptake so you may want to discuss moving to a non-hormonal birth control that can help with painful periods such as a non-hormonal IUD.

Those tests that I listed are other blood tests that can be helpful in determining the cause of the iron-deficiency. You stated you had it previous to puberty so menstruation is not your underlying cause for anemia. That needs to be determined in case it can be monitored, treated, or even cured.

I’m a medical lab scientist so if you have any questions about those tests I listed above, please feel free to ask. If you haven’t had them done yet, I would march into your doctors office and ask that they be ran as he/she is not using all their diagnostic tools."

medical_advice,fkmhtvv,t3_fj9luc,1584329398.0,It’s actually not the end goal of the parasite (bacteria and viruses) to kill the host. The best viruses and bacteria have a synchronous relationship with their host. (E.g. the majority of our vitamin K comes from E.coli in the gut. This is why babies need a vitamin K shot when they are born since they don’t have their microbiome established and it would be bad news bears if they couldn’t form a clot).

They just irrigated it real well with saline and an antiseptic and then steri-stripped it but if you have those butterfly bandages it’s pretty much the same thing. I have a gnarly scar but it worked. I just made sure it stayed clean and dry. If it stays wet for too long the tissue will expand while it’s healing and it’ll take longer.

Blood is broken down into packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and plasma (FFP) when it is donated as whole blood. Plasma and platelets can be donated as single units. These products are not always indicated together. Example: total plasma exchange for multiple myeloma patients can sometimes use up an entire liter of plasma and it can be daily for a week depending on a treatment plan. Meanwhile, a very small amount of the plasma that is collected at donation centers (volume wise) is used in an acute care or “life saving” capacity.

My source: I’m an immunohematogist aka a blood banker. It’s not misinformation, it’s the truth and it’s sad that I have to inform people that this is where blood products come from since there is such a shortage."

As I stated in my other comment, a big industry that utilizes this plasma is the makeup industry. I abhor the fact that people “donate” plasma at these collection centers and are told it’s going to directly save a life when they simply don’t know that. It’s waaaaay better to donate at a collection center and to possible give two products at once that can go and save four people, maybe more. As a bloodbanker I just struggle with the false sense of altruism that they advertise while the Red Cross goes through shortages."

medlabprofessionals,f8327df,t1_f82fzn0,1574202804.0,Noooo!!! Based on the size of the squamous epithelial cell and the WBC in the sediment that is not a renal epithelial sheet!! Individual renal epithelial cells  are 12-60 microns depending on the type (convoluted vs collecting duct) which means they are larger than a RBC (~7 microns). Those individual cells look to be about 1 micron or less. You should have the pathologist look at it. My guess would be artifact or drug crystal. When in doubt always ask your pathologist.

They accidentally infected many residents with pneumonia and urinary tract infections. The army admitted to the operation in the 1970’s but blamed the infections on the hospital where all the cases ended up.

We had to do 15 credits a semester while doing 40 hours/week of clinicals for a year and I’m not going to lie, it was one of the hardest things I’ve had to go through in my life. Learn from what you’re missing on the exams. They’re difficult because they want you to pass your boards. Keep hanging in there. When you’re not on the bench or sleeping, your life should probably be studying. 
The thing to remember is that once you’re on the job, you don’t need to know everything. The best tech is one who admits when they don’t know something, but knows what resource has that information. This will be a really tough year but the pay when you’re done is worth it.

The wonderful thing about clinicals is that you get to practice over and over and learn from mistakes. I personally believe the perfectionists are the ones least likely to succeed because you have to be able to take constructive criticism in this field. Oh, and ask questions, no matter how silly you think they are. I always tell students and new employees, there are no stupid questions until you’re ten years down the road and you should’ve learned something by then. Hope this helps and welcome to being the backbone of healthcare!

P.s. I didn’t draw for about three years because I was working in a major hospital where we always had phlebs. Fast forward to now where I’m working in a critical access and we have to do lots of phlebotomy, I always spend a couple minutes before poking the patient to make sure I have everything I need. Being super fast does not equal competence and I find the faster someone is, the more mistakes they make on a regular basis. You got this!
