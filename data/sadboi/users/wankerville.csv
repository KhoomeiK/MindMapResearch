AmItheAsshole,fkefmn2,t1_fkebk68,1584112178.0,"I guess I just didn’t get the same impression that the father was using his child as a pawn. Also from personal experience back when I was 13 and doing these things, I thought about my appearance changes a lot more than “5 minutes.” I think it’s a bit cheap to assume that 13 year olds can’t think for themselves a little bit more. They know a lot more is riding on their appearance than you think. They’re growing up in the era OF appearance on social media and what not. They see how “important” it is to look good and probably think about their appearance a lot more than we think, therefore not just taking 5 minutes to decide (although I’m sure some do this.)

Also, I already said it but my parents never used me as a pawn so I don’t know what this negative experience is like. My parents co-parented VERY well and had a lot of respect for one another. They didn’t have to have constant approval from one another for MY decisions about MY appearance. If I wanted to dye my hair, one would by the dye and id surprise the other with the new hair. They didn’t care because it was my decision to do it. They respected my decisions. They also trusted/respected the other parent enough to not need to be let in on every minute detail, like changing my appearance impermanently."
AmItheAsshole,fkeeda8,t1_fkecc58,1584111419.0,"I think where we are differing in opinions is that I didn’t experience parents who used their child as a “pawn” and despite what happened with my parents, they acted like adults in respect to me.

My dad is the one who started my colored-hair journey at 13. I told him I wanted to dye it green. We went to the store and bought green hair dye. Did he ask my mom first? No. What did my mom do? Nothing. Why? Because it was MY decision. My dad didn’t decide for me, he just helped me do what I already wanted to do. I even asked my mom if she was mad and I remember her saying that there’s no reason to be mad if it’s something I wanted. It’ll wash out eventually. Did she hate the color? Fuck yes. 

You can co-parent and still not be let in on every insignificant detail beforehand if you’re a mature adult who realizes that these things aren’t that big of a deal. It starts with having respect for your child and letting them do these things, and having enough trust/respect for the other parent to let them help their child achieve what they want without constant approval. If my parents had to discuss every dumb appearance change I wanted to partake in they might as well have been married still. You really shouldn’t need constant approval from the other parent for things that are as impermanent as an appearance change, especially since it’s the childs choice. Even if it’s a dumb one, it’s a learning experience. Those should be encouraged."
AmItheAsshole,fke7xjs,t1_fke0j07,1584107382.0,"I said it below but I’ll say again. A young girls appearance shouldn’t need a parents conversations when it’s so minute and impermanent. It places importance on her appearance and can create negative self-esteem issues. You shouldn’t tell a 13 year old girl that “girls can’t shave their hair off.” That’s so damaging. She’s old enough now to change her appearance for herself without permission (again, if impermanent, which shaving your hair is.) Her parents should have more respect for their daughter and allow her to do what she wants without both of them having a conversation about it. She may choose to do dumb stuff, but she’ll grow and learn from it. People in this comment thread are making it sound like a woman shaving her head is a big deal, which makes it sound like a lot of you place importance on a woman having hair to be feminine, which is not the case."
AmItheAsshole,fke6xkw,t1_fkcyhp3,1584106710.0,"This is such a bizarre outlook to me because at 13 I had next to full freedom to do what I want with my appearance. I didn’t need to ask, I just told one of them what I wanted to do, and they got me the stuff to do it. It sounds controlling and even prudish that at 13 both her parents have to be in on something as impermanent and minute as shaving her hair off. And that’s the real truth, that shaving your hair off isn’t a big decision at all in the grand scheme of things. Some people in these comments are acting like it’s like taking a loan out on a house when it’s so, so insignificant.

At 15 I HATED my hair because it made me feel self-conscious that  I could never get it to look right and I shaved it all off aaaand I fucking hated that too. However, shaving it all off did help me learn REAL fast that my worthiness as a women didn’t rely on my appearance, something that I think all women struggle with, especially teenagers. We grow up thinking that how attractive we are determines how important we are and it’s not true. Getting comfortable with looking like an egg, something I wouldn’t have been able to do with hair, gave me so much freedom and confidence and love for myself. It helped me more than anything else. Even just last year I shaved my hair again, as I was going through a rough spot with my self-esteem, to help ground myself again. And it worked. Because my self-esteem issues are completely based around feeling like I’m not attractive enough when I shouldn’t be worrying about that in the first place. I can’t imagine how bad it must be for young teenagers growing up in the era of Instagram and social media. I can’t imagine the self-esteem issues they deal with because of it all.

So I think saying that the dad should’ve asked the mom first puts WAY too much importance on the girls appearance, and the importance of something so insignificant and impermanent. It’s honestly pretty likely that the mom already said no to her. Teenagers usually ask one parent and then the other when that one says no. She’s 13 and shouldn’t have to asked for those things, and have parents with opinions and say in those things. She’s old enough to start experimenting with it all on her own. Good parents would show some support towards it. She’s young and just wants to try different looks on. It’s normal. The coloured-hair phase for me ended eventually and I got back to looking more normal, I guess, eventually.

Sure, you could say the dad should have asked the mom first out of respect TO the mother, but that shows disrespect to the daughter in my opinion, again, for the same reasons above. The parents should be starting to have less to say in their daughters appearance if it’s impermanent. In this situation I think the daughter is the one that deserved the respect though. People say teenagers are impulsive, and they are, but I doubt the daughter didn’t already put a LITTLE time into it. I know at 13 I still put some time and thought into what I wanted to do. Sure I didn’t give it a months time, but I usually had the idea in my head for a week before going through with it. She wanted to do it, and if the mother was allowed say it could’ve deeply discouraged her to do it and left her not getting that experience. At that age being told a girl shouldn’t shave her hair off is honestly pretty damaging in my opinion. At that age, and probably even now a little, I would’ve had thoughts like: WHY shouldn’t a girl shave her hair off? Why is my hair so important? Does my hair have that much of an impact on me? And if it does then why would I want the hair I have now because it never looks right? It’s ugly. Hair is important and mine is ugly. (Obviously not as poignant sounding, but you get the idea.)

So I think this situation shouldn’t have really existed in the first place because the daughter should be getting more respect from her parents to trust her to do what she wants with herself (if as impermanent as this), no matter the consequences. It’s a learning experience, it’s a growing experience. However, it did happen, and it seems like there was literally no perfect way of including the mother in the sense of the daughter feeling totally supported, which is what she deserves. If the mom was so angry after the fact, and saying what she said, she would’ve said those things before hand (granted maybe not as angry.) I think the dad simply showed full support towards his daughter and let her try something she deserved try. He didn’t make it a big deal by contacting the mom, because it’s NOT a big deal. Making a big deal over a girls appearance is kind of what puts the beliefs in our head that our appearance is what’s so important about us."

because we had cold beans every day - she would smack us all five times with a shoe and say ""tough its all we can afford. i'm trying to feed a family of 93 with just half a silver buckington"", a silver buckington was about the same as half a penny back in the day. then we would head to school. we met up with the johnson kids from down the road, and walked the 1674 miles to school. on the way to school, we had to walk up a mountain so tall it extended to outer space. when we got to the top of the mountain, we would see the peterson boys on their fancy bikes - which they dont make like they used to, and we would race them down the mountain. then, when we got to school at 4 in the morning, the headmaster would come up to us and say ""you bloody kids are late"", then he would smack us all with the cane 10 times and tell us we had 7 years of detention. then, we went to class, and mr stevenson would say ""ok line up kids"", then he would spank us each 60 times, then hit us each with the cane 40 times each. then it was 7 at night and we had to walk home. then, when we got home, we'd ask ""whats for dinner mum?"", and she'd smack us each 50 times with a pan and say ""rotten cabage"". and if we complained, she would smack us each 100 times with a broom and say ""im trying to feed a family of 154 on just one islet sliver, just you wait until your dad gets home"" - now an islet silver was worth about as much as a grain of sand. then, when our dad got home from his job at the soot factory, he would hit us all 180 times with his belt. if we had been naughty, we would hit us all another 600 times. then, at 1:58, mum would say ""ok time for bed"". then, we got into our potato sacks, and she would hit us each with a shoe 8 times before we went to sleep. on saturdays, we went down to uncle bob's farm to work. we would have to walk 345 miles to the bus stop, then catch the route 4 bus for 56 stops. we would get on the bus and pay our fare of 3 teddy roses - now a teddy rose is worth about the same as a flake of skin. then, if the ticket inspector came to us, he would hit us all 4 times with his baton. if any of us had lost our ticket, we would hit us all 10 times again and throw us off the bus and we had to walk the rest of the way. when we got to the farm, uncle bob would drive to the gate in his tractor, hit us all 780 times with his crowbar, and tell us to get in his trailer so he could drive us to the farm house. then, we had to plow the fields with a toothbrush in the blazing summer heat - now, they dont make summers like they used to, so it was about 1345.4 degrees spencer, or 67 degrees centigrade using your new-fangled metric system. then, we would have to milk the cows - now, they dont make cows like they used to, so each cow weighed about 459 hog's heads, or 3.2 tonnes in your new-fangled metric system. if you touched a cows udder, it would kick you and you would die, so you had to be really careful when you milked the cows. then, when we were done, uncle bob would say ""ok kids time for your pocket money"". he would give us each 9 copper jemimahs - which are worth about one political promise each - and beat us each 6 times with his tractor before we left. on sundays, we would meet the johnson boys and go down to the river - now, they don't make rivers like they used to, so this river was about as wide as the whole of america, and as deep as the marianas trench, and it was filled with liquid tungsten. we would play by the old oak tree near the river, climbing on it and building tree houses and such. now - they don't make trees like they used to, so this tree had a trunk as thick as a city, and was tall enough that the branches on the top could scrape the moon. one day, little jimmy fell from the top of the tree. when he hit the ground, the only bit of his body we could recognise was his left eyeball. we picked up all his bits and rushed him to the doctors surgery. dr james said ""oh its just a scratch little jimmy dont worry pop a plaster on it and you'll be right"" and he gave little jimmy a plaster and a lollipop and he was ok. after we finished playing by the river, we would go into town and get some candy. now, back in the day, you could give the shopkeeper one bronze winglet - which is worth about as much as a ciggarette butt - and he would give you the entire stock of the store. so we would go and get our candy, and we'd go into the town square and eat it. now, we didn't have any of your fancy food laws back in the day, so there was all kinds of stuff in our candy. bleach, lsd, ecstasy, you name it. so we would always get a little hyper after our candy. one day, when we were hyper, we went up the mr boris's car, the only car in the town, and touched it. as we touched it, we saw dad storming down the street holding his belt. ""you kids, having fun while i work all day in the soot factory just so you can have grilled water for tea every night, i oughta smack you all"". we were sure he was going to smack us, but then he said ""no, i got a better idea, ill take you to see mr henderson, he'll set ya right"". now, dad had told us about mr henderson. mr henderson was a veteran from the great war, where he got a really bad injury, but we never knew what it was. dad walked us all down to the pub, and we saw a left testicle propped up on a pegleg. ""mr henderson,"" said dad, ""i have some kids here who need a good whooping"". then, mr henderson picked up the entire pub, and hit us each 4006 times with it. then, dad said ""right, i gotta go back to the soot factory, you kids run on home now"". now, by now it was 1pm, which meant it was curfew. while we were walking out of the town square, we heard a man shout ""oi you bloody kids, its curfew"". we turned around and saw the constable holding his baton. he hit us each 160265 times with his baton, then put us in gaol for 60123865 years. now - they don't make gaols like they used to - this one had 5 mile thick steel walls, and a single hole in the top let in some light. we were in there for about 13526 years, until mum baked the constable some cardboard pie so he would let us out. then, she hit us all 1292 times with a washboard, and grounded us for the rest of our lives. so don't you come complaining to me about nonsense like not being able to breathe or not being able to feel your legs."

I have a very large body frame for a female. Broad shoulders, wide hips, size 11 shoe. I’m also very lucky to have good body composition (size small/medium (women’s) shirt, 12-14 jeans size.) 

I know I’m healthy despite my BMI though because I walk an average of 40 miles a week (very active job), lift weights 6 days a week, and eat relatively healthy (lots of eggs, fish, and veggies.)

I think it’s important to remember that not every body type is capable of being “thin.” It’s just not healthy and attainable for everyone. That’s why BMI is such a bad tool because it boxes every body type into a box and doesn’t take into account a ton of different factors (body frame, body composition, muscle and body fat.)

It’s so weird seeing all the insecurity pop up about them. They’re one of the most common hip shapes. They’re normal. They look just as hot as square hips and round hips."
Instagramreality,fgewllx,t1_fgdotrd,1580712844.0,"Bisexual girl here. 

I find hip dips super hot. My boyfriend also finds hip dips super hot. I know my brother once told me he missed one of his ex-gf’s because he loved her hips (she had hips dips.) Honestly, they’re just really nice for grabbing and make perfect little areas for your hands.

Idk when it became such a thing to not like hip dips because it’s definitely something I’ve only recently started to notice popping up a lot. It makes me sad. They’re just hips, you can only do so much to change the shape of them. Obviously there is clothing that can be unflattering for them, and wearing tight bottoms on them can pronounce them a lot, but that goes with a lot of things. Like short legs, long torso, big boobs, small butt."

I still have bad days, still get depressed and anxious, but I generally have a higher self esteem and moments of insecurity feel a lot more fleeting. It’s also given me a healthy coping habit when I’m feeling down. 

It’s important to find exercise you like though. I hate most cardio and find weightlifting to be the best thing for me because I like to feel myself get stronger and be able to add more weights and stuff. It sort of helps me set a goal. You can do the same with running via distance, time, pace, etc. 

I also really enjoyed dancing as a workout but unfortunately have no good space for it anymore.

AmItheAsshole,feov8d9,t1_fenvpku,1579306149.0,"Yeah men like this should feel ashamed for the generalizations they spread about their sex. 

I’ve dated two guys who were EMBARRASSED to tell me they didn’t like watching porn and couldn’t get off to it because they thought they HAD to like it. Why didn’t they like it? Because they felt no emotional connection to it.  These same men waited a month into our relationship to pursue sex because they said they needed to feel an emotional connection before they felt a sexual attraction, and that’s totally okay! 

It’s so gross to say that all men have super high sex drives and watch porn and have to get off whenever they feel slightly horny. Men are more complex than that and deserve better than to be blanketed under the idea that they’re crazed sex machines. 

It’s also important to say that just because there are men who watch tons of porn, that it shouldn’t be normalized as an okay or good thing. There are TONS of studies about the increase of porn addiction and it’s only getting worse with the ease of access.

Porn can be a great tool, especially as a safe place to explore sexuality, but it can also be detrimental to ones mental health and easily become addicting."

You’re sitting there talking about how if I’m “not available” for sex my boyfriend HAS to get off, and he HAS to watch porn.

Porn ruined his life and kept him stuck in a cycle of depression. He doesn’t watch porn. He literally has all porn sites blocked. 

Maybe the male bias of porn is higher because you’re on Reddit which is heavily used as a porn app as is. Maybe reddit in general isn’t a very good place to look for answers regarding porn consumption. 

The fact that you’re sitting here saying that stuff is real telling about yourself. You probably have more unhealthy porn habits then you’re ready to even admit to yourself, and to make yourself feel better, you’re lumping all men together as sex starved and having to watch porn to get off, and also saying that just because men are horny means they HAVE to get off so if their partners aren’t available, they best watch porn.

Also, do some research. Women have a lot higher sex drives than you think. It’s just not the same for women to talk about masturbating like it is for men. There’s a reason I said boys have been told that watching porn is okay, because boys literally are told that masturbating and porn is okay, whilst there’s little no conversation for girls on the same level. Girls are not encouraged the same way to understand their bodies and get off. Boys hide porn because it’s embarrassing, not because it’s seen as “wrong.” All my lady friends have sex drives through the roof. I’m bisexual, and every female partner I’ve had had had a MUCH higher sex drive than any man I’ve been with. We love sex and orgasms just as much as you do, it’s just not as open of a conversation for us as it is for you. Maybe you’ve got an unlucky bunch of girls who have low sex drives, or maybe you’re just not very good in bed and they’d rather get off alone. Who knows. 

Women don’t shame porn consumption either. They watch porn too. I know women who watch unreasonable amounts of porn and read tons of porn. It’s because they’re horny too. If porn is brought up as a problem in a relationship, it’s likely because you’re dating someone with very strong values against it (like maybe they’re religious), they’ve dated someone with a porn addiction, or maybe you’re the one with a porn addiction."
AmItheAsshole,fen5mlj,t1_femoq5w,1579277499.0,"My boyfriend doesn’t watch porn because when he was a teenager he got addicted to it as a crutch for depression and after breaking out of it he says he thinks porn is mostly just fake and unhealthy and has a negative effect on his mental health. 

I watch porn from time to time (as a female) but I don’t NEED it to get off. I think if the only way you can get off is via porn then maybe it’s become an unhealthy habit.

I also think most men dont have a good concept of how healthy their own porn consumption is and then get confused when they get a girlfriend who is uncomfortable with it. If you’re dying a girl and she brings up your porn use, it’s time to evaluate it. Can you still get off without it, both solo and with a partner? Can you go X amount of time without watching it. Do you find yourself thinking about watching it? Do you think about certain videos you’ve seen a lot? 

Boys have been told way too much that watching porn is normal and as a result have failed to realize that the line for healthy porn consumption is VERY thin. The amount of male friends I’ve had over the years who tell me they can only get off watching porn, or who have trouble actually cumming when with a partner, is alarmingly high. 

I do think it’s unreasonable of the girlfriend to expect him not to watch a movie that has naked women in it, but I also can’t help but wonder if MAYBE there’s a reason she’s being unreasonable and maybe OP just doesn’t realize how bad his porn habits might actually be. If they’re worse than he thinks, and their sex life is failing because of it, it would make sense that she feels insecure and uncomfortable with it (not that it makes it an okay thing.)"
AmItheAsshole,fen4at2,t1_femi9e9,1579276657.0,"Man, I don’t think you realize that dead bedroom and no longer being attracted to your partner usually goes deeper than just a partner gaining weight.

My boyfriend was fucking FIT when we met and now, years later, he’s got a stomach and isnt near as fit and has gone up a size but holy shit do I still find him just as hot as day one, if not hotter, because we have a good, fun relationship and my attraction to him is based on far more than just his appearance. 

Also, in every long term relationship I’ve ever been in, I’ve not once worried about their future appearance or our future sex habits. I’ve also never had any friends confide in me thoughts like that either. You might want to do some introspection and find out what that’s really about because it might be something a little deeper. Maybe you’re projecting your own insecurities of yourself onto her, maybe you’re not attracted to her in general as much as you thought you were, who knows. 

I just know YTA and a huge one."
AmItheAsshole,fen2etw,t1_femxhyr,1579275459.0,"100% correct here but I’d say it’s less about learning to compromise and more about just respecting his partner. He’s being a HUGE asshole and he’s showing her zero respect. He’s trying to say that she’s not communicating whilst in reality she’s communicating by setting the boundary that she doesn’t want to talk about it. He needs to RESPECT that boundary and stop thinking in terms of only himself and his feelings.

I cried for two weeks after a therapy session and all my boyfriend did was give me cuddles, chocolate, and the reminder that he’s there for me IF I need anything or want to talk. He never pushed anything because I COMMUNICATED I didn’t want to talk about it. So he RESPECTED that like a good partner does. 

I cry a lot and over dumb shit. Crying is a healthy way to release stress hormones and to vent emotions. The guy shouldn’t see his wife crying, especially after therapy, as something that needs to be fixed, especially right away. I understand where he’s coming from in terms of that, because when my boyfriend cries it breaks my heart, but we are both humans. If my boyfriend needs to cry then he needs cry, and as his girlfriend I don’t get the RIGHT to know what’s wrong, I get the LUXURY. Sometimes I don’t always get to know and that’s fine because I TRUST my boyfriend to communicate anything that would be detrimental to our relationship or to himself."

Instagramreality,fd2xghp,t1_fd1k3yf,1578152666.0,"There are actually contracts that can prevent that from happening is the problem. I know of a celebrity right now who’s stuck in a contract that, if they decide to go bounce, has to wait so many years before being allowed to produce what they’re famous for. When a persons management is really bad, they tend to do whatever they can to keep them down. On top of that, there’s almost always a contract that prevents them from being able to talk about the management. Existing fame can’t always get you back in the game when you’ve been stripped of all your money, especially when there’s a good chance that there’s still contracts in play that need to be navigated. Often times the best thing a person can do is just spend years negotiating down contracts and getting out of as many as possible. 

You also have to remember that these celebrities managements are extremely manipulative. I truly believe most celebrities don’t end up in messes because they’re dumb, but because their management manipulated them and made them feel like it was the best thing to protect them and their career."

So many people fail to realize that a large majority of celebrities have little to no control over their public life (which often has legal ties into what is allowed even in their personal life) and that what we see of them is largely constructed.

It’s both a good and bad thing. Good, because if the management actually cares and is good it means your private life is protected and you can have a sense of privacy. Bad, because the people who are supposed to be protecting you can easily have control over your whole life and tie you up in legal binds and contracts that, if broken, can make you lose everything.

StrongCurves,fcpa45r,t3_eid698,1577855787.0,"On my journey of health, fitness, and battling disordered eating my doctor made a big point to drill two things into my head. 

First, overeating every once in awhile is GOOD for your overall health and metabolism. It helps combat your body from getting used to your calorie intake which can create plateaus in a lot of weight loss and fitness journeys. 

Second, it’s bad for your mental health to try and avoid foods you enjoy for the sake of your weight and “health.” Eating healthy is important and you should make the effort to do so, but to cut out foods you genuinely enjoy isn’t going to improve your health by any means. It’s good for our spirit to eat things we really fucking like, like cheesecake and chocolate. Feeling guilt over eating these delicious foods is what creates disordered eating and a bad relationship with food. If you’re going to eat it in the first place, just let yourself completely enjoy it because you deserve to enjoy those things. Always let your relationship with the food you eat be positive.

Your progress and effort is still there and tomorrow is a fresh day to get back to the healthy eating. :)"

Also maybe a little diary area where you can put entries on your minimalism journey and see how you’re progressing.

Another addition could be a little area where you store photos/notes of items that had sentimental meaning but it was useless to keep such an item. I know what helped me get rid of a lot of clutter was taking photos of items that I wanted to remember but not necessarily keep.
