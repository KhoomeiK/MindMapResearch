fitbod,fjg5goz,t3_f4uf9u,1583312371.0,"hey there, i am experimenting with this app as well and i have been wondering about the bodybuilding mode in general.

i don't seem to get much soreness when i try to include machines and cables. i have been using barbells most of the time and i gain mass the fastest. 

so i have my doubts on this app concerning bodybuilding - i am not sure what is the intensity expected of me and how much is really enough.

i played with the duration from 1 hour to 2 hours and there is a myriad of exercises to choose from - all too confusing for my liking."

Are they worth evolving?"
