I remember a few years back, mishpacha magazine was very busy trying to bridge the gap between religious and non religious in Israel. Anyhow, they did a large poll asking secular Israelis all sorts of questions about chareidim.  The outcome of the poll was basically that secular Israelis didn't have too many opinions about chareidim because most didn't really care and didn't really think much about chareidim.

exjew,fmor2fl,t1_fmogfv9,1586266645.0,"I recently saw a discussion about this. Apparently, the most common reason for this is because in American society men typically socialize and connect with each other through ""things"" and not feelings. So men typically will talk about sports, movies, politics, etc. And they will give opinions and facts, make jokes, etc. But other than expressing anger, men are generally uncomfortable sharing how they feel, with each other. 
Women typically socialize by sharing ideas and feelings, and are certainly comfortable sharing feelings. 
Now many men want to share feelings with friends but are uncomfortable doing so with other men, so they naturally gravitate towards female friends where they are more comfortable expressing how they actually feel when having discussions. 
I can say that this has been my experience. As a married orthoprax guy, I don't have too much opportunity to have female friends, but the few that I've managed to make, (entirely through work settings), have been an eye opener for me. I've been able to have conversations that were far more comfortable than those I've had with my male friends, and I much prefer female friends to male friends, especially by non-jews who I had a harder time connecting with, as there was far less common ground."

Neighborhoods vary though. While most of Lakewood is very yeshivish and judgmental, there are some neighborhoods further out that are more liberal. Especially in toms River and some in Jackson. Thankfully, I've managed to move into one of these types of neighborhoods, where I can dress how I like, show up to shul if and when I want to, and I don't feel much pressure about it.

With regard to this rabbi's answer, I don't understand why financial issues allow us to say have bitachon, while marital and emotional issues don't. Is god only capable of providing finances but not capable of providing marital bliss and emotional health? And if having kids is so super important, why not start having them at 13. After all, the more the merrier, right? And did this rabbi, in all of his vast wisdom, never think that financial pressure will cause marital strife and emotional health issues? Is this brilliant rabbi willing to give up his own new car and trips to the Bahamas to pay for the extra children? Seriously, what kind of self righteous idiot prick has the audacity to tell someone not to go on European vacations and not buy new cars every year when the guy is simply saying he cannot afford another child.
