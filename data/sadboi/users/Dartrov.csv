Brawlstars,fqgfmsn,t1_fqg90v9,1589345041.0,It makes sense because we were expecting the update message to come up
islam,fppsv5o,t3_gevb18,1588808488.0,It doesn't help much if you are swearing in your reply. You don't need to reply to these people anyways since they won't change their view. They could but I doubt it.
DragonballLegends,fpgteee,t3_gdb2nq,1588609174.0,The first one I got was grn future gohan then ex broly and now lf vegito. Im usually not lucky at all but I'll take it.
DragonballLegends,fp9jwyz,t3_gc1ko5,1588428072.0,Got grn future gohan :(
FortNiteBR,fp7lrlz,t1_fp78603,1588373034.0,I was playing solos. I finally won after getting sweat lobbies for 10 games. Most of the people were bots or couldn't build at all. I have tried arena but I keep facing smurfs or people that just shit on me even though I only have 400 points.
FortNiteBR,fp7lgxj,t1_fp7cyxx,1588372870.0,I won a game after getting clapped like 10 times in a row. But the people I fought against were bots or a lot worse and couldn't build at all. Does hidden matchmaking delay help? I could try it and test what kind of lobbies I get.
FortNiteBR,fp7crmo,t1_fp7c470,1588368192.0,That's what im doing but for some reason I can't apply that to a real game. I do well against my friends but when it comes to a real game I turn into a complete bot in the eyes of others.
FortNiteBR,fp79tes,t1_fp794jn,1588366640.0,It sure is
FortNiteBR,fp79rla,t1_fp79b51,1588366614.0,"Well damn. I used to play back in season 2 but I stopped playing after 5. Came back this season. Must be why, but Im only at 358 and I imagine people having 600+"
FortNiteBR,fp79ewj,t1_fp786e0,1588366432.0,Im not that bad though it's just that I can't compete with the guys that are way above me. I suck at hitting shots since im on ps4 but the sens I have now is fine. It's just hard to play against people that have way higher skill. It's just recently I have been getting sweat lobbies and I was wondering why that was.
FortNiteBR,fp791b7,t1_fp78au5,1588366237.0,I used to play on pc but ps4 is just really hard to get used to. Anyways I had a bad laptop and it was hard to play on it so I just switched to ps4. Can't really do much against pc players or just better players in general. I can't get better if I get clapped on 24/7. The only thing I suck at is aiming. Tried different settings but yeah
DragonballLegends,fn6g32t,t1_fn6dqzs,1586698320.0,Nope this also happens when we have more than 20 ki
DragonballLegends,fmr12il,t3_fwxnkt,1586311438.0,It's the update
DragonballLegends,fmqw6ky,t3_fwwttg,1586308382.0,And why tf do they have 7 hour updates. I have never played any games other than legends which has these kinds of update times.
islam,fmpdud7,t1_fmpctsi,1586279069.0,Thank you for the reminder
islam,fmp5joz,t1_fmp1mnv,1586274833.0,I know that but is it bad that I prayed when I wasn't supposed to?
islam,fmkzer9,t3_fuzz2q,1586174185.0,Jeg er også norsk og jeg har også det samme problemet. Prøvde å snakke med mamma om det men det går ikke. Hun vil ikke høre eller bruke logikk. Jeg håper at din familie er mer åpen til diskusjoner og sånt men husk at alle non muslims skal ikke til helvete. Du kan søke det opp og se om noen i familien din passer med infoen. Kanskje det kan hjelpe litt?
islam,fmkwy5b,t1_fmkqmrf,1586171779.0,It's not by default. If you finish a test at school do you get everything wrong by default? Could happen but you could also get everything right.
islam,fmjdcro,t3_fvndsv,1586128029.0,Don't forget he never said that he even is in the first place.
DragonballLegends,fmfz3bm,t1_fmew6lw,1586037863.0,I was wondering why I was always losing after having the upper hand. Right before they lose they lag like hell and I end up losing for no reason.
DragonballLegends,fmfyrna,t1_fmfi5m6,1586037666.0,He could still win though. I beat it after a few attempts without boost units and I have been playing for 30 days
DragonballLegends,fmfykxx,t3_fuwmc9,1586037554.0,Bench?
DragonballLegends,fmfw0ct,t1_fmfkhf3,1586036012.0,Hope it works out for you
DragonballLegends,fmf4h6r,t1_fmf3z5e,1586019749.0,I was using him before but the team was lacking hp/defence
DragonballLegends,fmd1ijz,t3_fuhkpl,1585957273.0,How did you do it so fast? I always do the 7hr ones but is there something im missing?
islam,flzf13p,t3_frinv9,1585622129.0,Didn't you say that you had a mother or father that died? You even said that you prayed for your parent to burn more in hell. If you want to make it as a muslim I suggest you stop with that. I didn't mean to sound rude but I just have to say the truth.
islam,flucnea,t1_fltj08m,1585499949.0,"I also need help with finding a hobby. Like the only thing I do is to watch some videos and play games. If you want to feel happy I would reccomend finding a community for a game you like since that way you could find friends. I don't have any friends from school or anything but I have a good friend that feels like a brother to me. Im sure you know somebody, maybe a cousin or something. If you do it could be good to contact him and find something to do online or even irl. That's my tips, good luck bro."
islam,flsleg8,t1_flsgpx2,1585444808.0,I don't know how old you are right now but when you are growing up im pretty sure that's the only way you can get those things. I don't even know what kind of problems you have but I hope you somehow solve your problems. If you still have problems with your parents just talk to them about it. If they don't do anything to change after that you might consider getting help.
islam,flseee7,t1_flsaqmm,1585440259.0,What did they even do to you? I can't imagine it being that bad. There are people in this world that has it much worse and here you are complaining. If they were the worst parent ever I bet you wouldn't even have the device you are using. Be thankful that you even have a place to stay and food to eat. Now get over it and move on.
islam,flsdqe3,t3_fq23ff,1585439849.0,"Im also 17. Have no friends, quit school a few months ago. I stay home every single day with nothing to do. I vame back to islam recently and that's when I started becoming more positive. Started praying 5 times a day. Talking with my parents more. Started training. I even feel like going back to school after the pandemic. I would say learning more about islam made me happy (never been my whole life). Having a purpose and learning more about islam is what is making me go the right path again. I would reccomend thinking about what you could do right now. Living life like you could die any second and do good. That's what motivated me. I hope this helps, good luck brother."
islam,flscnwk,t3_fq6n66,1585439183.0,"I think this is made to help disabled people but can later become something more. I mean if it helps the disabled then sure. I think they have to make a little hole in your skull to put the little device in your brain, so that would not be allowed unless of course it's something that will not harm you and benefit you at the same time."
islam,flsbvbx,t1_flrqolj,1585438687.0,"It's like this with my mom. Spent hours talking to her about islam but she just ignored everything. I even gave her facts and predictions that is in the quran and hadith that nobody could know 1400 years ago. She just said it was a crazy man that just made islam. After everything I told her I said, Is he at least a wise/smart man? She didn't answer."
islam,flsaqah,t3_fqnpwi,1585437983.0,I understand how you feel since something similar has happened with me. I had a girlfriend and I was always worried that she might be talking to somebody else and all that. This was a few months ago when I did not follow islam at all. Then when I found out that she was cheating on me even though I treated her well and put all my energy into the relationship it was hard to accept at first. I became depressed and had suicidal thoughts and all that. Thankfully I came back to islam and then I learned that what I was doing was haram. At that point I just moved on and learned from my mistake. I think you and I have learned why it's better to marry straight away (ofc after investigating and checking if everything is good and us too). It's better to do it the islamic way because then we don't have to worry about all these things like cheating and losing somebody. I hope that you find somebody better soon and follow through the right way.
islam,fls9cfg,t3_fqsqxs,1585437127.0,How can you hate your parents? Without them you would not be here. They took care of you and gave you everything. Even if they are bad parents they still care about you but they might not show it. Also you should think about what you might have done to them. Have you listened to them or did you always do things on your own. There are many reasons as to why they might be angry all the time or treat you badly.
islam,flm308i,t1_flm0mvs,1585273396.0,I guess you coult try going to the masjid and tell the imam about it. Maybe he knows something or someone who has experience with this. You could always ask Allah swt to help you if nothing works. Also if you have anything left from your ex just throw it out or burn it. If you still have a girlfriend you should break up with her right now since it's not allowed to have one. I used to have one a little while ago but when I came back to islam I just told her about it and we went our separate ways.
islam,fllzuym,t3_fpiwgc,1585271338.0,I felt like you recently and that's when I started to think about religion again. I started watching debates and dawah channels which led me to do some research. After I found out that islam is indeed the true religion (even though I called myself a muslim all my life) I started learning how to pray for real and now at the age of 17 I am praying 5 times a day. That was a week ago and now im even waking up my father for fajr which he never used to pray before at age 50. It's never to late to ask for forgivness if your heart is at the right place. May Allah swt show you the way ameen.
islam,fllypdt,t1_fllxqvv,1585270599.0,I don't know anything about this but it may be that you believe that you are going to hear something or you think that something is going to happen and then it does. It happens all the time that my mind thinks about something I would never agree with or do but if you learn to just control your thoughts you can quickly think about something else. Also if reading quran does not work then it's probably not sihr. I imagine you have not gone to places where they give you amulets or any sort of items and you have not pissed off a random magician.
islam,fllx8ou,t3_fpn2kp,1585269677.0,I think you should check with a doctor first
DragonballLegends,flkzg2p,t1_flkz9o5,1585250676.0,Tried that before but I never get answered so whats the point?
DragonballLegends,flkzdjz,t1_flkz72u,1585250632.0,All of my equips are from gamepress. Should I just select them on my own with defence or health in mind?
DragonballLegends,flkz8t4,t1_flkz2ys,1585250547.0,Instead of vegito? Literally put him there to test him but he has no synergy with the others.
DragonballLegends,flifxha,t1_flgzqub,1585181680.0,You're not alone
islam,fkyu2ma,t1_fky17sv,1584656165.0,Thanks I will try that.
islam,fkyu13b,t1_fkykw9k,1584656140.0,Sounds fair. My dad is not a shia but I think he was just confused lol.
DragonballLegends,fjie1n9,t1_fjiar7x,1583365614.0,Got a good account pn my first try though and I have the other app in my secure folder.
DragonballLegends,fjhm8qk,t1_fjh57ak,1583350838.0,I found out how to do it easy. Just put it into the secure folder on android.
DragonballLegends,fjhm67h,t1_fjgo9im,1583350797.0,I tried getting the game into the secure folder on android and it worked without getting banned too.
DragonballLegends,fjgje9o,t1_fjgivs3,1583328304.0,But I have a good main account so I don't want to delete the app everytime I have to play on it again. I want to be able to access both whenever I want. Do you know how I could do that?
islam,fjbsctr,t1_fjbnetv,1583200361.0,I guess you could call it that
islam,fj9rbh0,t1_fj8lq9g,1583157606.0,Thank you
islam,fj9r0wt,t1_fj99p4r,1583157384.0,"I will try to, just need a little break."
islam,fj9qzi0,t1_fj996gf,1583157353.0,Im still searching for the thing I like but I will try to go back to school after a little break.
islam,fj9qv4z,t1_fj9968e,1583157260.0,"Sure, I will try."
islam,fj9qskm,t1_fj98u0o,1583157205.0,"I will try to, just need a little break that's all."
islam,fj9qq8z,t1_fj96qiy,1583157157.0,True. I will probably go back to school after a little break just to get a decent job.
islam,fj9qjio,t1_fj93p14,1583157013.0,I was feeling like never going back when I posted this but after all the comments I got I feel different. I just feel like I need a little break and then I'll go back.
islam,fj9qcm0,t1_fj92kox,1583156869.0,I will look into it. I probably just need a little break from everything and then I'll be back.
islam,fj9q91m,t1_fj8use5,1583156792.0,I hope you and your mom will live a good life ishalaah. I just need a little break and I think I might be good to go after that.
islam,fj8t3nk,t1_fj8stbg,1583121511.0,I will look into all the options I have soon.
islam,fj8t130,t1_fj8s88s,1583121456.0,I will look into it.
islam,fj8syq2,t1_fj8sljr,1583121407.0,But god knows everything that is going to happen with our lives so I would say that it is fate. But then also if you don't believe in god then it's not fate. Everything could be both ways for you but it's you who decide what the answer is.
islam,fj8soyb,t1_fj8rzzy,1583121202.0,I have thought about it but im not really interested in anything. That could just be because I don't know what I like yet. I will start thinking about it more though.
islam,fj8sinj,t1_fj8rt3g,1583121073.0,I will ask them to bring me to a place where I can get checked inshallah.
islam,fj8sb0v,t1_fj8rze4,1583120919.0,I meant that somebody filmed your entire life without you knowing it type of deal.
islam,fj8rmq9,t1_fj7i60n,1583120434.0,It is the same with a film. The people in the film can do whatever they want but Allah has seen the film. The people in the film had free will right?
islam,fj8puoh,t1_fj8pj3m,1583119185.0,Thanks bro. My dad told me to start doing something while im on my break. Going to the gym in a few hours :)
islam,fj8pn8f,t1_fj8pccj,1583119038.0,I know that very well. I am thinking of going back to school or doing online courses after all the feedback I got. I think I just need a break.
islam,fj8optn,t1_fj8oahr,1583118382.0,As a guy that has spent a lot of time alone I know more about myself than people do about them. I just need a break and I will probavly be ready to go back to school.
islam,fj8okd3,t1_fj8o581,1583118277.0,Thank you. After all the feedback I have gotten I feel like going back to school after a break. I know how important it is to finish but it's really hard right now and I really need that break.
islam,fj8o4i3,t1_fj8npsg,1583117969.0,I never said I wanted a good job. Also it may just be that I need a break from school. If I feel like it in the future then I will go back.
islam,fj8msvm,t1_fj8m4k4,1583117059.0,"The thing is that I tried getting help at school and I had a meeting with somebody who was going to help, but I didn't even have the motivation to go to the second meeting. Also I don't like talking face to face so it is hard for me to talk about personal stuff that way."
islam,fj8ml1c,t1_fj8lwr4,1583116913.0,Inshallah. I will try to send the school a message. I also wanted to check if I have any ilness or condition but my parents say Im normal. Not so sure about that though.
islam,fj8m7ud,t3_fc3lzh,1583116670.0,I am not sure but I think I heard that we made the choice before becoming human. We could become angels or accept the test and have a chance at having a higher status.
islam,fj8knxz,t1_fj8ju1u,1583115627.0,It's not the study part. It's mostly the part of getting to school and being there that is hard.
islam,fj8kktc,t1_fj8j6um,1583115569.0,Im looking into doing online in the future. I could just need a 1 year break and if everything goes well or I change my mind then I will be back at school.
islam,fj8hu4p,t1_fj8gsup,1583113743.0,They are supporting me now but soon it will be my turn. I wouldn't say ruining my future though. More like walking on another path.
islam,fj8g1hp,t1_fj8f7lp,1583112555.0,That's great. Inshallah I will be in a similar situation.
islam,fj8frzr,t1_fj8eval,1583112382.0,I will be going back once I feel that everything is right. Even my dad still goes to school even when he has jobs but he said the exact same. Seeking knowledge is something we should do all our life.
islam,fj8ei90,t1_fj8eakn,1583111534.0,If I feel like getting a better job in the future then I will.
islam,fj8eeb3,t1_fj8e43w,1583111462.0,I don't live in the US though. I live in Norway.
islam,fj8dyen,t1_fj8cspl,1583111167.0,I know I could probably do it but I hurt myself everytime I go there. It was a daily struggle when I did go there. It's like I was fighting myself and then I got depression. It is not possible for me to go there without hurting myself mentally. School should not be like that and if it is then it's best not to go. I was going to kill myself a few months ago because of all this but thankfully I found islam again.
islam,fj8cbmv,t1_fj8bqfa,1583110063.0,Ruin? I have a house and everything I need. I don't need to get a good job just to move out and buy a whole new house for no reason. I don't mind working to stay in this house.
islam,fj8by6b,t1_fj8bo5c,1583109816.0,Thanks
islam,fj8bubf,t1_fj897zh,1583109744.0,I just can't deal with it. It has been like that ever since I was 13. I don't have friends and nobody likes the stuff I do. It's a 1 hour trip just to get there and that makes it even worse. The last school I went to was literally 3 minutes away but I still had problems. You also know that muslim families are big and live together so it's not really a big problem if I turn out to be bad. I am happy to see that my brother that is 1 year younger than me got into the best school but I don't even know if I could do what he does.
islam,fj88sfm,t1_fj87vc0,1583107701.0,Of course I know that they might not be around forever but we have talked about everything and I will even start looking for work tomorrow. I was also thinking about going back to school or taking online courses in the future if I feel like it.
DragonballLegends,fj4xi2r,t3_fbb3k8,1583019264.0,I was banned 3 times yesterday but not today. I tried using 4g today and I have not crashed yet. I feel like saying this might make it crash but whatever.
DragonballLegends,fj228lz,t3_fb0kbz,1582932834.0,"Update: Well damn, it happened again 2 times. Waited for 3 hours now and I can't even play because I keep getting kicked out."
DragonballLegends,fj1be1b,t1_fj15m95,1582916546.0,Oh sorry. Will remember that next time.
DragonballLegends,fj0wxj4,t1_fj0ppqz,1582909098.0,I did and now I got 4 pieces I wanted to S
DragonballLegends,fj0jjxb,t1_fj0h66n,1582901448.0,I did check but I can't get romantic drive and incarnation of evil. Am I missing something or can't I get them at all currently?
DragonballLegends,fj0erzt,t1_fj0corc,1582898175.0,Oh found it. Btw do you know what the best one for them are? Or should I just read the stats and pick what I need?
DragonballLegends,fisac75,t1_fis9xe3,1582681032.0,I forgot one thing. What is the ability bonus for? Thank you for helping a noob lol
DragonballLegends,fis9tpf,t1_fis8hma,1582680765.0,I get it now. All people with regeneration will benefit from the Z ability right? I guess I could add green piccolo too since he has that tag for now. One last question. Will the people that are on my team of 6 still give benefits to the others when they are not currently used?
DragonballLegends,fis89rx,t1_fis815t,1582679912.0,Thank you. How do I get a Z ability?
islam,fi3jiwe,t1_fi3c99i,1582120721.0,That's how it feels like in western countries. Feel like all the girls have done something they should not.
islam,fi34em7,t1_fi2z204,1582100426.0,I say this because in my honest opinion this is the truth. I am not seeing a therapist.
islam,fi2f2e5,t1_fi2dio0,1582078273.0,"Thank you for your response brother. My situation goes a lot deeper and is very complicated but basically I go to the worst school here (lowest grades). I used to be a troublemaker before and never really learned much from school. I had to change course to IT which I used to be interested in but am no more. I have been absent from school for months at a time and my father had to beg the school for me to continiue. My days used to be very boring when I didn't go to school. I wake up at around 12-15 and I skip breakfast. I just wait for my mom to make food around 16-18. The only thing I do during the day is to watch videos about games and stuff like that. When I don't watch anything I play games, And I do all this until 2 am. Recently I have stopped playing games and I only watch islamic videos or debates. I have tried to find hobbies but I don't have any interests and I don't know what I want to do in the future. The reason I don't feel like going to school is a very private one and im afraid it can't be fixed. I can say that it will be very awkward for me if I went to school and it will be a daily struggle."
islam,fi2dmfg,t1_fi2dbkh,1582077313.0,"I was just curious about this, but have never done it, I was just trying. I have learned that this can be very dangerous after an experience I had (not intentionally)."
islam,fi2cn4y,t1_fi2bagw,1582076661.0,"I did start training recently and I can feel that it helps. Im 17 so I still go to school. I have a problem though because I live in Norway. I have looked into many different religions for the past 3 years and I have found that Islam is indeed the right one. I was never a good muslim before but I recently started believing fully and this has led me to learn how to do prayers again. I will be a good muslim in the future but it is hard to find a good muslim girl in this country. I can't really let my parents pick because they don't have any connections, and I forgot to mention that my mom has lost her faith. My dad can find somebody but he comes from another country and I don't want to deal with people I can't speak with. I have tried online dating but it did not work because my bad personality. I don't want to change myself and my interests only to get a girl. I also feel like having a wife and children will limit my worship. I am doing really bad at school because I don't even talk to people or have any friends. School is almost over and I will end up having a bad job. I can't imagine being the man of a family when I can't even take care of myself. That's why I was just thinking I could be a virgin my whole life."
islam,fi2b241,t1_fi2ammq,1582075621.0,I am very shy in real life and I don't have any friends and I never talk to people. My looks are good but i don't have a good personality.
