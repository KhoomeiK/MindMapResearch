And 9 days ago after posting that i did cut her off... she came back begging me to keep her and promising me she’d change and stop being toxic. I said fine but i promise you this is your last chance. and i stick by that. I’m not a major simp or anything like that & i know my worth. I’d just like to maintain a friendship if it’s possible.
relationships,fmzdbab,t1_fmzcy7e,1586516219.0,"I was thinking maybe if i go out my way to speak to other girls it could possibly help? At the moment i’ve been telling myself i have absolutely no energy or desire to be speaking to any other girls for a long time & when i do i want it to happen organically, not forced. She’s very extroverted and has plenty of people to speak to, i think maybe that helped her a little. I wouldn’t say i’m introverted but i prefer to have a small circle of real friends rather than tonnes of fake friends who i just have small talk with all day long. So i’m thinking maybe first of all try going out my way and forcing myself to speak to new girls and see if that helps at all, if not after that then maybe i’ll cut her off. It would just be a shame as she is literally the only person i have that i can openly tell ANYTHING to without feeling judged."

Edit: Let me give you an example: a few weeks ago she started messaging my friend which annoyed me slightly so i asked her to stop and she kept telling me it’s not that deep and she wouldn’t care if i messaged her friends. I got a little bit annoyed but we moved on and nothing more came of it until today. Her friends added me on snapchat and i added them back, not thinking it would bother her because she literally said “i wouldn’t care if you messaged my friends”. Anyways i didn’t message them, i literally went straight to her and told them they added me & straight away she questioned, did i add them back? Being honest i said Yes and she got angry at me because she didn’t like it either. So basically she did something i didn’t like and acted like she wouldn’t care, but when it does actually happen she does care. Anyways this argument got more and more heated and i said to her “you acting like you don’t care all the time has caused this, if i knew you cared i wouldn’t have added them back. You not caring is probably the reason you lost _______.” She fell out with her bestfriend a few days ago. And yea :/ she got upset about which i understand."
