MadOver30,fnqm0fl,t3_g3aq9b,1587167312.0,"Yup.  

There's this place way in the back of my skull that I automatically retreat to during certain times.  It is lonely back there.  But it is familiar and safe.  It also is very difficult to leave.

When I'm stuck there, it becomes very difficult to connect with anyone.  It becomes difficult to feel what other people are saying to me.  I am surrounded by a lot of people and a lot of chances to connect every day, all day, but I find myself withdrawn, awkward, scared, bored, sad...above all I find myself frustrated that I am unable to engage.  I simply can't.

It is my belief that there is a reason for being stuck in the back of my head.  It goes like this...my subconscious is filled with unprocessed thoughts, emotions, false beliefs, expectations, sorrow, trauma...a heavy burden.  My conscious is incapable of function due to this burden.  I believe our conscious is what allows us to connect and engage, almost like an open door in the front of our awareness.  So when it is closed off, we feel alone and dissociative.

So what do?  I guess I already laid it out...btw thank you for posting this I needed to hear your struggle to unburden my own struggle.  So, all these unprocessed challenges weighing us down must be directly addressed and expressed to allow us the freedom to once again live in the flow of awareness, call it being present or mindful or whatever.  I think it takes work.  Where to begin?

What helped me, and surely I need to do it again, is shredding through my subconscious by writing a cognitive behavioral therapy thought record.  The one I use, and recommend, is found at the website ""I want to change my life"" , taken from the excellent book of the same name.  That  is the nitty gritty for me.

The other tool is dialectical behavioral therapy.  Talking to people.  Yeah I know...friends you can open up to are hard to come by these days...but if you can find someone to even get shit off your chest... literally anyone...I highly recommend it.  Typing posts is good, but doing it in person is cathartic in a way that borders on the spiritual.  Tell someone how you feel deep within, and don't hold back.  Release the mess in the most brutally honest way possible.  Of course it does help to ask permission first.  But don't be afraid to have a reckoning with your feelings.  Our current social constructs frown upon this, but fuck social constructs.  We need to unload every once in a while.  It can change your life.

Anyways...hope some of this was useful to you and I hope you find a way to express and engage the way deserve.

Good love."

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fa0b1sh,t3_e75off,1575751938.0,"2 years in recovery and I was still sleeping 12 hours a day, couldn't hold a job (like for reals, walked out mid shift out of a very easy part time job due to being so tired and so anxious), almost admitted myself to the psych ward several times, suicidal ideation, panic attacks, depersonalization, numb, lost my sense of humor, lost my identity...lol sobriety is great!  Not exactly what I thought would happen, and like you said, the greatest fear of getting sober were feeling like garbage, experiencing PAIN, and being completely lost in the void...which is totally what happened!

But

These things were ALWAYS there...or...always waiting to be dealt with.  Fucking all of it.  The sleeping, the lack of energy, the depression anxiety existential panic disorders are...well they are indicators that become PAINFULLY obvious once I stopped using.  They are blaring horns that are telling me that I have something that is wrong, and a lesson needs to be learned.

Which

Is what sobriety is all about.  A chance to grow.  A chance to change things.  A chance to deal with the most painful and difficult shit that haunts us, deep deep within.  And it can be very challenging, and take a good amount of time depending how much needs to be dealt with.

So

Don't give up.  Don't think you are alone, or must do it alone.  Find those people that get it, that understand the pain, and fucking go after it together.

Be patient

Be curious

Be active

Be kind

Great things will happen"
socialism,f8fyhn9,t1_f8e18qt,1574551227.0,Is any news outlet reporting on this?  Can you please provide any?
depression,f7z4ydz,t1_f7z4624,1574105378.0,"Oh yeah, I also wrote gratitude lists."
depression,f7z4624,t1_f5uczsw,1574105044.0,"Sure.  A few of them, including my oldest friend, had the same feelings.  I reopened contact with them.  The first thing I actually did was go to rehab for alcohol abuse.  Almost everyone there was struggling with deep emotional pain, the same pain that You felt.  So I easily connected with them.  After sobering up there I moved into a sober house and geewhiz we all were suffered from major depressive disorder and chronic anxiety.  We bonded in profound ways.  To the point that we could share anything.  This transcended the pain, and turned it into laughter and joy.  So that aspect is important.

But I am also privileged, in that I was able to take time off work for a long time in order to recover.  So I need to be careful not to say oh just do this and don't even worry about money.  Unfortunately the financial issue becomes a massive barrier for most people just trying to get fucking help.  I'm sure there is a social safety net somewhere tho...

So getting back to the small steps.  In survival mode out instincts take over.  We feel the need to seek out some immediate and drastic change that will cure us.  That probably worked at some point in history, but right now it isn't what will get me or you out of chronic emotional pain.  What we really need is self compassion, acceptance, and connection.

Remember this: Willpower is a finite resource.  After we use up our willpower, we are tempted to throw in the towel and say fuck it, I tried, the results were shit, so I'm going back to the old familiar behavior cause I'm broken and nothing works.  That, is a lie, and is a result of something or someone that made us overly critical of ourselves.  The voices that say, ""You dumb fuck, you can't do anything right, you were born to fail, you can't win at anything, you weirdo just give up."". So, again, ingrained lies that fuck up our ability to process emotions OVER TIME, and make changes OVER TIME, without losing faith in ourselves.  Patience, or faith, or whatever you call it, to STAY THE COURSE.  Look into CBT.  Move away from catastrophic thinking.  Allow yourself to feel compassion towards yourself.  We ALL deserve to have compassion.  I mean, holy fuck, the hell we've been through, NO ONE has the right to criticize our process, tell us to suck it up and get over it, especially our own brain.  So accept that you need time to heal, change can be uncomfortable, be patient with yourself, and STAY THE COURSE.

So my small steps? I guess it depends where on the journey I was.  If I couldn't get out of bed, I would take out my phone and read about depression.  I would read stories of success, and how to get out of that living hell.  If I could get out of bed, I would go tell someone how fucking depressed and or suicidal I was.  Talk it out.  Doing so would elevate my mood just enough to perhaps walk to the mailbox.  Doing that got me to take a shower.  Doing that got me to eat some food.  Doing that got me to get me to talk and share more with others.  Doing that got me to drive somewhere beautiful or interesting.  Doing that got me to desire living in the world and explore more.  And in and on.  One moment at a time, over time.

Eventually, met with a doctor to see if there was something physically wrong with me.  Looked into medication.  Met a therapist once a week.  Went to recovery meetings.  Learned how to play magic the gathering.  Learned to cook.  Learned about self care.  Did some jumping jacks in the morning (THIS ACTUALLY WORKS GREAT)  Cleaned my room.  Cleaned my car.  STAYED THE COURSE.  Started waking up before noon.  Looked at the world and asked it to help me help it.  Looked at my progress.  Reached out for help during crisis modes.  Learned coping strategies.  Ate healthier food.   On, and on.

And it wasn't willpower that got me through it.  It wasn't shame, or fear, or societal pressures.  It was acceptance, self compassion and connection.  And everyone deserves to have those things."

Had to get on the right combo of meds and therapy.  Moved into a house with six other people in recovery.  We all talk about it.  We all go through it together and try to get outside ourselves by exploring the world.  Making plans to do whatever.  

Slowly, steadily, Sparks of joy return.  Find commitments and stick to them.  Eventually work.  All the while expressing emotions, crying laughing feeling.  Recovering.  Processing whatever it is that has us so emotionally bent.  

Now all I care about is connecting with others and sharing joy."

MadOver30,f7p0dnc,t1_f52kq61,1573938926.0," ***""I know comparing myself to others is just going to dig myself a deeper hole, but... Fuck mental illness. I look around at people who haven't struggled through periods of engulfing depression, or constant anxiety and overthinking..""***

Compare away!  Just make sure it's coming from a place of compassionate curiosity.  The tough part of phenomenology is that we never truly know what other people are going through, even if they look good on paper \*cough\* (social media) or in our imaginations.  We all have our unique battles to face.  Resenting others is natural and can be consuming, majorly so when our mind uses it as proof that we are different and isolated from others.

***""they've got careers, or at least steady jobs.""***

So do I.  It didn't grant me happiness or wholeness.  I had to work on myself for three years before I was ready to become a reliable employee, and change takes time...more on that later.

***""They've got long term relationships, maybe even kids..""***

My best friend has kids, a high paying job, house in the suburbs, etc.  He is going through severe depression and anxiety.  Our external accomplishments don't reflect how we actually feel.

**""They've been on holidays, and amazing adventures.""**

FOMO.  Yeah I struggle with that too.  Those are things I get to do a bit at a time.  Figuring out how to deal with my MDD/PAD/SA and get to a place of stability unlocks those doors.  Now I just have to be courageous enough to walk through them and start being adventurous.

**""What have I got? Self harm scars, a tonne of college debt, and a battle against myself I just can't seem to fucking win.""**

I never self harmed.  I drank instead.  Which really fucked my shit up and now requires an active recovery program.  It took me twenty years to get over it.  Now that I have, hooray my problems are all still there.  But at least now I'm just clear headed enough to tackle all my terrible inner issues.

I'm in debt too.  Financial problems are a massive burden and can fuck up life.  It is just something that must be accepted as a reality and attacked with methodical solutions.  Loan consolidation, proactively working with banks, proving that you have a medical condition or disability (depression is actually considered a disability where I'm at) can but the lenders at bay.  There are solutions.

***""The longest I've held the same job for is a year. And it was a shitty retail job, not at all related to the career I'd like.""***

Yeah pretty much lost every job I've had until recently.  Lived at home until 35.  Menial work was about the best I could do.  And holy fuck even that was a challenge.  Constant panic attacks while working retail, missing days from being so exhausted due to how painful living was (plus hangovers).  Years of that shit.  Broke me down and I still have CPTSD from it.  A few years later and I have a job nowhere related to where I think I should be, but oh well, it pays enough to be financial independent, doesn't have to last forever, and I can always carve out my true passions/purpose on my time off.  Again, it feels like it takes forever and will last forever, but that is how real change works.  Continue searching for breakthroughs, they will come, as long as you start becoming comfortable with being uncomfortable.

***""The longest relationship I've had was 2 years? I think? I dunno. They walked out, got to a point where it became too hard, being with me became too hard. Every relationship I've ever been in, they've reached that point. The take home message is that it's too difficult to love me.""***

My last relationship was in highschool.  Lasted 9 whole months.  Which was twenty fucking yeas ago!  AAAAHHHHH...so now I get to look in the mirror at this middle aged man with practically zero dating experience and not one female friend.  Humpf.  Well, one thing at a time.  Small change leads to big changes.  The girlfriend thing will happen, if I am willing to have it, but first I need to become a healthy, resilient, datable person.

***""I can't even find a therapist, I just want someone to talk to who understands, who empathises, and can call me out on my bullshit. But for one reason or another, can't find the right ""match"" of a psych.""***

Finding a therapist was a huge pain in the ass.  Took some time and a lot of phone calls.  Finding the right therapist is a big deal.  Just got to keep at it and sooner or later it happens.

***""And I've never managed to successfully ""adult"". Y'know, pay bills, do regular laundry, etc. I feel like a defunct excuse for a human.""***

For now.  This is how you feel and where you're at now.  Plenty of room and time to get to where you want to be.  Find the resources to get there, BE PATIENT, make small moves, BE PATIENT, don't catastrophize, and change will happen.

***""When will this depressive episode end!? Even I've gotten sick of my self-pity... I'm just nowhere near where I thought I'd be in life. Nowhere near the person I want to be, or living the life I'd like to...""***

Fuck what society or other people think where you need to be.  This isn't a race.  It's a personal journey out of Hell.  Just be sure to ask for directions.

&#x200B;

So in summary, here's what worked for me:

\-Being patient with myself and learning self-compassion

\-Working with doctors and psychiatrists to see if medication was appropriate

\-Talking with other in recovery and asking for their help

\-Saying the serenity prayer (and meaning it), without the God bit, every morning

\-Realizing that change is a process and not an event

\-Realizing that resentments are poison

\-Making lists, reading books, taking chances, leaning into being uncomfortable

\-Continuing to do the next right thing"

A few years ago, I finally surrendered to the fact that nothing will change, unless I start taking action.  Like lots of small steps in different directions.  A daily grind at first, with lots of misteps and awkward moments.  But I shared this struggle with others.  So many others.  So much shared pain.  We lifted each other up.  We talked openly about suicide, hopelessness, anger, fear... everything.  It made me feel better, knowing how many people go through the same exact shit that I do.  And poof...I suddenly had a support group that actually cared about me.

Now I have people in my life that I quite literally trust with my life.  I go do things.  Explore the outside.  Take chances.  Leave my comfort zone.  And I still have work to do.  Room to grow, in all aspects, to find balance, joy, and resilience.

leaves,f3t4rop,t3_dhyfma,1571118395.0,"I agree.  Hell, just being a human is traumatic enough.  There are two things at play here.  The degree of trauma and the individual's reaction to it.  When we're young, we simply lack any strong coping skills to process traumatic events or situations.  So these events get pushed deep within us, and remain there.

When we are old enough to learn new coping methods and ways of processing what did happen, if we're lucky, we find guides or lessons to deal with that pain.  But many of us don't, and end up assuredly relying on chemical manipulation of our feelings.  And why not.  It's the socially acceptable thing to do, repeated over and over again in beer commercials, movies, holiday gatherings, etc.  When was the last time meditation or talk therapy was heavily advertised?  Well, it wasn't.  In fact, it has a deep stigma attached to it.  We simply frown on healthy coping skills in our society.  The tide is turning, yes, but on paper our culture is a fucking mess.

I'll leave you with this.  None of the above fucking matters.  Addiction is cruel and unfair and society may never understand the systemic nature of it.  The only thing that matters is what we, you, me, us, do today.  Fuck the status quo.  Fuck social norms.  We only have today, right here, right now.  We know we can't do this alone, pull ourselves up by our bootstraps nonsense, and must work as a community.  But we must go forth, together, process these things together, accepting what we have control over now, and only now.

Research.  Planning.  Implementation.

Research:  Look up YouTube videos of those who successfully treat their depression.  There are Ted talks.  Learn about the physiology behind it.  Learn about the root causes, maybe it's past trauma, maybe not.  But in any case, be it physiological or not, the brain goes into a survival state.  When in this state, options seem limited, life seems dull, and it feels like it is a permanent and hopeless condition.  This is how it FEELS.  But it is not the truth.  With certain steps, NO MATTER HOW SMALL, you will find your way out of it.  Which leads to planning.

Planning: Which steps are the right ones to take?  Having done the research, you will learn there are certain things, many of them counterintuitive, that you can start planning to do.  This is hope for a happier, healthy you.  In the beginning of this planning process, it's the little things that make the biggest, quickest difference.  Some are, taking a short walk.  Writing a CBT journal.  Writing things you are grateful for.  Talking to someone about what you are going through.  Jumping jacks.  Cleaning your room.  Etc.  Remember, motivation follows action.  For the bigger steps, you have things like seeking out a therapist, talking to your doctor about possible medication options, following up with a psychiatrist if you have the means, starting an exercise routine, going on hikes, changing your diet, meditating, etc.

Implementation: Having created this list of treatment goals, begin doing them.  Again, start slow.  Walk to the mailbox.  Clean one area of your room.  Little actions lead to bigger actions.  Then you can start the bigger things.  Make an appointment with a therapist.  Speak with your doctor.  Go on a jog.  Meditate for 5 minutes.  On and on until you reach a place where you can continually move out of survival mode, which exists in the brain, and in living mode, which exists in the heart.  Go easy on yourself, you are recovering from not only drugs, but from depression.  It will take a little time, but it works if you keep at it."

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,ew8isg6,t1_ew8he8d,1565210240.0,"Oh right, I forgot to explain the depression and anxiety part.  Depression, whatever the cause, forces the individual into survival mode.  So avoidance, difficulty seeing solutions, self soothing, extreme fatigue...you get the picture.  It's pure survival.

Anxiety is closely related to depression, and is also inspired by survival.  It is being overwhelmed by trauma, no matter how big or small, putting the body in the fight or flight or freeze.  Again, pure survival, unbalanced, out of homeostasis, and far away from flow.

The idea isn't to remain in a constant state of flow, although that would be nice, but to find that sweet spot between the two.  Rapidly switching between flow and survival is bipolar, slowly cycling between them with gradual peaks and valleys is, I think where most healthy people fit."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,ew8he8d,t3_cn54f0,1565209625.0,"I have a ""work-in-progress"" behavioral model that explains addiction, depression, and anxiety.  The two components are the ""survival state"" and the ""flow state"".  All humans are survivors of trauma.  The degree at which we experience or are subject to trauma varies wildly.  When internal or external stressors become intense, we enter the survival state.  The defining properties of this state are impulsiveness, reactiveness, and avoidance.  When we move out of the survival state, either through substances or behavior, we enter the flow state.  This is the highly sought after state of being, defined by patience, security, and engagement.

The issue with seeking quick, easy flow is that it is typically volatile, especially for those unable to navigate out of their survival state.  The individual feels they must quickly escape this survival phase, by any means necessary, so naturally reaches for the easiest solution.  If the individual is more balanced between the two states, it is much easier for them to experiment with those quick and easy ways, like drinking or gambling or whatever.  It's all about balance and regulating homeostasis between survival and flow.

Anyhoo, just some thoughts that your post inspired.  Cheers!"

stopdrinking,ew4odre,t3_cmpt22,1565114902.0,"This is so good.  It highlights the stages of relapse so well.  Which is really what our struggle is all about, relapse prevention.  So as you may or may not know, relapse begins well before the first drink.  It starts with emotional relapse (feeling guilty, staying up late, distracting ourselves with technology, isolation, etc).  Then after we can't stand the way we feel, or are unable to handle external stressors, we move to the mental phase.  A battle in the mind between using and abstaining.  This is a dangerous place to be and is also very uncomfortable.  If these feelings and thoughts are not expressed, through telling someone or playing the tape forward or immediate use of coping skills, a choice will be made to move into the final stage, physical relapse.  The mind has been made up, the drug is being sought or planned on.  There is still time to change course, but it is difficult.  

So then...what do we do?  

Realize that relapse has stages, and depending on which one you're in act accordingly to move backwards, like a cat stuck in a tube, until we get out of the fucking hell hole of perpetual relapse.  Cheers."

The rush of the drugs was exhilarating at times, sure, but it usually was the situation itself that was really fun, and the short high of the drug was followed by terrible pits of despair.  It's like being a slave to a substance that you depend on wholly for all joy.  But that is only half the story.  The other half is the consequences, the desperation, the loneliness, the disconnection.  It's the false promises of an eternal high.  Where in reality, which is full of pleasurable activities, good times come and go.  But no good thing happens without some effort and patience.  There's also the depression which abounds in sobriety.  Well, depression, as nasty and soul fucking as it is, can also be treated.  Remaining depressed in sobriety is so common because it's a coping mechanism when we're stuck in survival mode.

Bastard now wakes me up at 8am every morning, and you know what?  Shit is working.  It is painful as hell for me to wake up early, so why not swallow those buckets of pride and ask for help?  I think we have an issue in our society where we are expected to do everything on our own, lest we look like wimpy wieners.  It's okay to ask for help.  We get by with a little help from our friends."
Anxiety,euzj1au,t3_chy4xx,1564120557.0,"There's so much you can do.  Change your diet.  Go outside and walk around.  Talk with your doctor.  Take CBD or magnesium supplements.

I'm going through enormous pain due to anxiety so bad that I can barely function.  But I know that if I keep taking little steps in the right direction, I'll end up in a different, better place.

Be gentle with yourself.  This isn't your fault.  It's the result of a fucked off brain disorder.  But there are so, so many solutions.  Make small steps towards them and you will be better.  Truly."
hsp,eu6ukuy,t3_ceucio,1563509388.0,"I'm digging into Thomas Campbell.  His theory jives with me.  Most notably, that we are here to grow, to learn, to evolve our consciousness.  He does consider this reality as a virtual one, which is maybe not the best analogy, but the message is on point.

It's been a very long road for me.  I've studied theories on the meaning of life, the afterlife, quantum mechanics, the occult, on and on.  So far this is the best, all inclusive theory I've found.  It's all about lowering the entropy of our consciousness, facing our fears, overcoming our ego, and becoming love.

Life is one giant leaning experience.  We all face challenges.  It's about dealing with those challenges, growing up, evolving.  We are a part of a supersystem of consciousness, experiencing this physical reality as conscious beings, in order to learn and grow.  It's not real, but it is important.  Learning to work together, share, cooperate...those are the reasons we're here.  To love one another, and to grow as individuals.

Peace"
Anxiety,etv9jtu,t1_etv7ctz,1563229672.0,"Well, I do seem to be unusually tired most of the time.  In the morning I must eat before all else, then eat one or two hours later.  Then maybe I'll be okay for a bit, but must have snacks around or else risk having a panic attack.  Then I'm okay until dinner, when again, I must not go too long feeling hungry or boom panic attack.

It's a shitty cycle.  I think that exercise helps... maybe?  And I also am going to add longer lasting carbs to my breakfast, like oats.  I've gained a good amount of belly fat eating this way for so long, and hope that somehow, one day, I won't have this weird relationship with food lording over me all the time."

addiction,etq17zj,t3_cctk1r,1563069779.0,"You're addicted.  Not just to coke or alcohol.  When they are combined a new chemical is created.  Which is more addictive than them on their own.

There is a solution.  Acknowledge that you are addicted, and that you always will be.  There were good times.  And there were the consequences.  It happens to millions of people.  But there is a solution.

Surrender to the fact you can't use those substances.  Give up that fight.  It will never work.  Read about addiction.  Get smart.  Go to places where other people have moved from active addiction into recovery.  AA, smart recovery, whatever.  Change the way you feel by changing your behavior, and soon enough, you will have a life where it is easier not to use.

Remain active in the solution.  Explore yourself and dig deep.  Begin to trust yourself again.  More importantly, begin to trust that no matter what happens, you will find support, if you look for it.

Be honest.  Be willing.  Be active.

Cheers."

Could be the medication.  Could be a lot of things.  There are always factors at play.  For me it was being emotionally overwhelmed after quitting drugs.  For me, I had to realize that my consciousness is real and connected to my body, just like everyone else.  Walking in nature, meditation, connection with other people face to face, exercise, etc. got me back into my body.

Don't be afraid.  You are safe.  Your body is safe, even if it wasn't before.  Learn to love it and dive back into your heart and grow in the world.  There's so much to do.  Safe travels."

skeptic,eqyygdy,t1_eqxwwen,1560391291.0,"I'm going to go ahead and support this fact.  The steps are suggestions.  HOWEVER.  To those on the outside, and even those among the rooms, the persistent use of the word God, Him, His...gives the impression that AA is, in fact, a religious cult.  I mean the organization uses the principles of the Oxford group, a highly religious Christian organization.  I'm a member of AA and those principles have always put a bad taste in my mouth.  

Thankfully, as you pointed out, the steps are suggestions and the interpretation of God is left to the individual.  Heck, the most spiritual person I've ever met in AA gave me an agnostic revision of the steps.  And the entire premise that AA is founded on was the spiritual experience that Bill W. had when he tripped out on Belladonna in the hospital.  Bill even wanted to have newcomers use LSD to get that same experience, and as we are starting to see with the promising use of psychedelics, he was probably right to want this.

The spiritual experience, which leads to a psychic change, is the only thing that matters; the steps were devised to facilitate this spiritual experience.  They may not work for everyone, as AA readily admits, which is why they remain suggestions.  The fellowship of AA also is second to none.  I've never, in all my years attending meetings, had anyone demand that I believe in their God.  The only thing they want is for us to get and remain sober.  Period.  Most of the people that have continued sobriety in the rooms have worked the steps in the some manner.  Most of them continue to question the original use of God, have their own unique belief systems if any, and stay connected with other alcoholics.  They keep coming back, despite their hangups, and remain sober because they are willing to set aside their cynicism and stay connected with other people who want to remain sober.  I've seen it hundreds of times."
spirituality,eq11d58,t1_eq0gw4t,1559699040.0,"I have a very good friend who used to say the same things.  That people were actors/conspiring/aliens and started putting unrelated things together as proof that a massive conspiracy was going on.  It was scary to watch him go through this, as it looked much like schizophrenia.

&#x200B;

Well, it turns out that it was a byproduct of severe anxiety and past trauma.  When the mind cannot handle that much stress, it dissociates from the body.  I've experienced this also, for two straight years, but was lucky enough to know what was happening.  Unfortunately he didn't understand why everything felt so surreal and disjointed in this dissociative state, so came up with very creative ways to rationalize his feelings by coming up with this Truman Show narrative.  I wish that I knew what he was going through at the time, but lacked the knowledge to help him.  So I'm reaching out to you, to perhaps offer another reason for feeling this way.  The world is complicated and our feelings can be even more complicated and scary, but remember that although feelings are real and valid, they're not reality.  Find perspective in the world, find a way to build trust in others, ask for help, continue to search for answers, and beware of irrational fears based only on feelings.

changemyview,epunswj,t1_epufv4i,1559512609.0,"There is quite a push from the left to get off oil, at least from a few certain constituents and policy makers.  I agree that there needs to be a stronger, revolutionary type set of new standards to usher in an oil independent era, one with advancements in green and sustainable technology, putting planet before  politics.  There are very dangerous special interests that actively squelch this idea, and we need to participate more in free elections to place the right people in office.  I believe we need a revolution in our voting booths, getting more people involved and informed."

undelete,epe64ms,t1_epao5dk,1559178953.0,"Sure.  I watched her video on ""The Great Replacement"".  In it she is very concerned that native peoples of Europe are being replaced by foreign peoples.  Her intense concern for this made up issue was my first clue.  The fact that her statistics were completely made up was my second.  The third, well, what is the point of making a video that pushes a made up belief that Europeans are somehow being REPLACED by Muslims and Indians and Pakistanis?  Isn't this yet another conspiracy theory that white people are being replaced by non white people?  Why isn't she concerned about Polish immigrants (which far outweigh the others)?  Ask yourself, critically, what is her point?  Why is she concerned?

Not to mention the manifesto of the Christchurch shooter shares this video's title... it's shit like this that Stokes the flames of very real racial insecurities and leads to very real violence.

This was my introduction to Ms. Southern.  Her words and her videos.  Not from a blog, or Reddit post, or someone else's opinion.

I continued to research her, looking at what she said and what she had done, and why, who she associates with, and why, on and on.  And thusly I reached the conclusion that she is, objectively, a piece of white nationalist trash."
