‚ÄúI deeply appreciate your perspective. I had been seriously wondering what this at-home testing situation meant for students without supportive home environments--which most of my students have (not all). Just to clarify, the CB has NEVER administered tests to international students in the middle of the night or early morning, and there is a slight risk that if we allow this to be okay once that it will become ""normal"" (they are already trying to market it as ""night-time testing""). On the other hand the CB has, for almost a decade, given two separate tests at times that are reasonable for all students, worldwide.  I feel as if the CB looked at numbers rather than people, and that your students and my students are both disadvantaged by that big data (big money?) approach to decision making.  NEITHER of these groups of students should be summarily disadvantaged by the College Board's ill-considered, hasty attempt to salvage whatever it is they are trying to salvage.  We are on the same side. We both want equitable testing conditions that help our students. In the end, one of the positives that will come of this is understanding the wide range of students who are taking these ""testing opportunities"" as they call them. If we don't silently or cynically accept blatant inequity from a multi-billion dollar ""nonprofit"", then together we may possibly force them to look at the children they are providing the ""testing opportunities"" as human beings, not numbers. I would be more than willing to sign a petition on behalf of the students that you are deeply concerned about being severely disadvantaged by the at-home, on-line testing that the CB is rolling over everyone.  I could not agree more: this is complete ""arse up"" ‚Äú"

His daughter (whom I‚Äôve never met) got adopted by a family who apparently gave her a loving childhood (it‚Äôs speculation at this point) however the two boys aged out of the orphanage and what I find most heartbreaking is that the pictures that we found that I still have because I couldn‚Äôt bear to not keep them is photos of my grandfather and my grandmother going to visit the boys in the orphanage it tore my heart into for those boys who have now since died I believe they both died of cancer at fairly young ages.
