So I met some guy on the internet and after some time of talking to each other online we had a date on the nearest movie theater. I think it went pretty well then (we even kissed), and after that he even said he enjoyed it.

After some time he started taking longer and longer to answer my messages. I got tired of waiting so much and deleted  him from my social media. Still, after a few days he started messaging me again, even apologized, I accepted. But nothing changed, and he even disappeared after we agreed to meet again.

My question is: what is going on? And if that is rejection, why would someone just disappear instead of simply saying they don't like me.

Ps: sorry for the long text its for context."
