Of particular interest from that link:

CoronavirusUT,fmt637g,t1_fms9o3v,1586367454.0,"Ok, so testing is free, it was part of the second stimulus package congress passed (not the $2 trillion package) to guarantee free testing to everyone. What may not be covered by your insurance is the doctor visit you will have if you have not called the screening hotline (801-587-0712 or 844-745-9325 toll free) or used the Telehealth resources. UUH is not currently part of the Silicon Slopes online testing program at this time. If you have **any** reason to believe you might need a test call the hotline and a nurse will go over it with you."
CoronavirusUT,fms695x,t1_fmrad16,1586347850.0,"- Testing is too stringent (they are still asking if you have been traveling.)

- As the nurses that are conducting the phone screening become more accustomed to the calls they are passing fewer potential patients through to testing but are still issuing very specific guidelines for what people should be doing. 

- Telehealth, it’s great but see above point. 

Spread of misinformation;

- Anyone can drive up to one of the U of U testing tents and see a provider ( source: I work there), if you have not passed through the phone/Telehealth screening the provider will give an exam (vitals, listen to breathing, etc.) before ordering a test. If the provider feels you do not need a test they will not order one but will send you away with instructions to follow. I liken this to if you walk into the doctors office and ask for a dengue fever test they will give an exam and probably not order a test. When this scenario happens people go home and post to Facebook that they couldn’t get a test when they went to the tents while not mentioning the rest of what happened. 

- When people do get a test the results are not immediate so they are sent home with self quarantine orders including specific timeframes and instructions on what to do until they get the results. Some of these people go home and post on Facebook and other gossip machines that they got tested but didn’t receive any kind of “treatment” but were just told to stay home. When others read that they think they don’t need to get tested because either they can just stay at home (slightly true) or they think if they get tested they might get quarantined and not allowed to leave the house (yeah, that’s happening a lot because we know people won’t stay the fuck home.)

- The perpetuation of the myth that COVID-19 is just like a mild flu, which it’s not.

- The muddled messaging about the virus/disease, a lot of people think they are the same thing. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes the disease COVID-19. As many as 50% of the people who acquire the virus (SARS-CoV-2) will not acquire the disease (COVID-19). There is an incubation period of roughly 14 days during which you are contagious but might be asymptomatic, you might have a slight cough or a runny nose, you might think you have a cold or it’s “just allergies” so you don’t take the precautions you should. Each person that acquired the virus (SARS-CoV-2) will spread it to approximately 3 additional people, Utahns love pyramid schemes but this is not the one to get involved in. If you develop COVID-19 you will wonder why god hates you. If you have to go to the hospital you will spend 10 days in utter misery and hell without your family - only communicating with the via some variant of FaceTime. If you have to go to icu and get put on a ventilator you may never wake up and you will die alone. **This is not the flu.**

Any, or all of these may be contributing to the decline in testing."

I cannot count the number of times I have encountered some variant of the question/statement that ""we are only finding new cases because we are looking for them."" Basically the notion has spread that if we stop looking for it, it will go away. If you notice on the linked graphs you will see huge spike in testing and then a dramatic drop-off, we don't know why that happened we have a few theories; maybe the screening questions are too stringent (probably, they are still asking if you have travelled internationally), maybe people are getting bad information from sources like Facebook (very, very likely, people that get tested are told to stay at home and self-quarantine for at least 14 days unless symptoms get worse at which point they should go to the ED, when they post that and say they didn't get ""treatment"" and didn't get an immediate test result when people read that they think testing isn't worth it because they don't want to be quarantined, our adherence to stay at home guidelines is roughly 24%), maybe people are getting misinformation and hearing muddled phrasing from news outlets about what the virus is and what the disease is and what the availability of testing is (yeah that's happening, everyone can drive up to our testing tents and be seen, if you have not been through a screening phone call you will still be examined by a doctor who will determine if you need a test, exactly like if you present claiming you have dengue fever they aren't just going to test you without an exam first.) We have thousands of tests at our facility because we expected to be doing hundreds of tests per day at this point.

SaltLakeCity,fma4dx3,t1_fma1mhv,1585883533.0,"Thanks for asking, it's a slightly more complex question than you might think. We absolutely want more people getting tested, the only way to contain the spread is by getting people tested and isolating the infected. However, we don't want people just coming and demanding to be tested when they have no cause. However, we are prepared to be testing 100+ cars per day at each location and we are not currently approaching that number which means our models are either drastically wrong or there are a lot of people who need to be tested but are not, probably somewhere in between. I was talking to one of the doctors at the testing tent yesterday about this very thing and how its kind of creepy because we know there are people out there that need to get tested and receive treatment. I think a lot of people have bought into the propaganda that it's not worse than the flu or a cold, or maybe the misinformation about the tests/results is causing people to avoid coming in.

But yes, we need more people to get tested."

You can become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and never develop COVID-19. Approximately 25-50% of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 never develop COVID-19. The virus has a 10-14 day incubation period during which you are contagious and during which your bodies immune system might fight off the virus."
SaltLakeCity,fm9x60n,t1_fm9hcqf,1585878580.0,"I work at a UUHC clinic. We are doing a bunch of testing but no where near what we should be doing. We had one really big day (I don't remember if it was last week or the week before, everything is kind of blurring together) but since that day we are only testing maybe 30-40% of what we expected. As far as I know nobody has any idea why people aren't coming in to get tested, we guessed it might have been the turn in weather because the busy day was warm and sunny and then it turned drizzly and cold but that theory hasn't held true as we have seen nice days and still not had many people come to the tents. I wonder if the phone screening is too stringent but that is outside of my pay grade.

I can say we have the PPE and most materials we need **now**. I can't give exact numbers because I'm not authorized to but I can say if nothing changed in our current usage rates we could make it more than two-months. Our usage rates are not going to remain at current levels, they are about to increase - dramatically. Assuming we don't get resupply of our primary PPE; blue gowns, N95 respirators, procedure masks, PAPR/CAPR hoods and shields, our projections have us running out of those materials significantly sooner than that. I am not authorized to say when but trust me when I say *significantly*.

Current modeling shows we are just entering the upswing of the surge and we expect it to last 16-20 weeks, early August-ish. Modeling is showing an anticipated date for peak around June 9th. I can't really say anything else.

We are stressed and terrified. We doing a lot of waiting and wondering. We know what is coming and in a sense we just want it to get here and at the same time we don't. The one thing we need more than anything is for people to stay the fuck at home. We talk about it everyday and are appalled and enraged. We are sitting here waiting for the shit to begin and we see countless people out and about oblivious to how much worse they are making our upcoming job. The elephant in the corner is we know some of our coworkers are going to die, we don't talk about it but we know. Just within the University we have over 100 doctors and nurses already out either already sick or actively monitoring. We know that some of our coworkers are going to die. Imagine going to work every single day knowing that.... hell is coming and people want to go out and make it worse."
SaltLakeCity,fm8vplj,t1_fm7swco,1585856910.0,"A small problem is people are confusing terminology. We are dealing with two problems; the novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) and then there is the disease COVID-19 which is caused by the virus. 

You can become infected with the virus (SARS-CoV-2) and not get the disease (COVID-19); 25-50% of people who contract the virus will never show symptoms but will still be contagious. 

The virus (SARS-CoV-2) has an approximate 10-14 incubation period in which the carrier can pass it along to others, during that period you might feel perfectly normal or you might feel like you have a cold or experience mild flu like symptoms - this is your bodies immune system. 

If, for whatever reason, your immune system does not defeat the virus (SARS-CoV-2) you will develop COVID-19 which is the disease that is shredding lungs and killing people. For the lucky people who contract COVID-19 you will only spend 10 of the worst days of your life experiencing the seasonal flu on steroids raised to the power of 12. For the unlucky you will spend 10-30 days in the hospital probably on a ventilator for a large part of that. For the truly unfortunate, you will die.

It is very easy to contract the virus (SARS-CoV-19) and it is very easy to pass on the virus without knowing you have it, someone infected will spread it to roughly 3 more people. I might have it and not know and within my 14-day incubation period pass it on to you, you might then, within your 14-day incubation period, pass it on to your grandma or the little girl next door with cystic fibrosis or your coworker who goes home to their spouse that lives on oxygen. 

It is impossible to know if you will pass it on to someone who will only live with the virus (SARS-CoV-19) for 14 days or if you will pass it onto someone while spend two-weeks in the hospital on a ventilator which is why, out of an abundance of caution, must treat it with such an incredible degree of seriousness. It is also probably why there is some muddled messaging about the difference between the virus and the disease.

A few weeks ago there was an [episode of the podcast The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/podcasts/the-daily/italy-coronavirus.html) with an interview from a doctor in Italy working at a hospital in Milan. He talks brutally about what is happening, he tells about patients dying alone without even a nurse or doctor in the room and how because the doctors and nurses are so busy trying to keep other patients alive the families of these patients don't even get told and only find out by calling the hospital. He talks about so much and it is heart wrenching. Everyone should listen; I work at one of the University healthcare clinics and statistics say one of my coworkers is going to die. The current projection for peak is June 9th, consider that. The surge in cases is projected to last until late July or early August which will return us to where we are currently. Sixteen-weeks of hell is coming."
AskScienceDiscussion,flhn1kp,t1_flhi4rc,1585165761.0,"The other day I was listening to the New York Times podcast *The Daily* and they had an interview with the chief surgeon of Milan’s largest hospital. In this interview the Doctor described how they have had to come up with an entirely new decision process for treating the sick including determining if an elderly patient is worth the resources needed to keep them alive, basically if you have an 82 year-old and a 42 year-old you choose to save the 42 year-old because if you try to save both you might not save either and the younger patient has a lot more life to live. In short, they have reached a point where they are choosing to let patients die without much, if any, treatment. 

He also talked about how family isn’t even allowed in the hospital and because of that patients are dying alone, the nurses and doctors aren’t even in the rooms because other patients need them more. The nurses and doctors are so busy and over extended they aren’t even reaching out to patients families, the only way people find out if their family died is by calling into the hospital and asking. It’s brutal. 

There is very little difference in how Italy and America have handled this thing, a lot of “oh it’s not really bad.” I work in a clinic and am properly terrified of what is going to hit here over the few next weeks. We are 6-8 weeks from **peak**, we are going to be dealing with this until July. Someone I work with is going to die, a half dozen or more will get so sick they live the rest of their lives with respiratory problems. This shit is terrifying."

Please understand, this patient was refusing to leave the exam room until they had received a test and knew the results. They were asymptomatic and had no contact with a person in a watch category and as such they did not meet the criteria for a covid test to be administered, there are countless diseases for which you will not be tested if you do not meet the criteria. If have a belligerent person and your options are to swab their throat and tell them the test is negative or have the person arrested what do you do? It may seem harsh but triage often is. If the providers and nurses had any reason to assume the person had covid they would have swabbed them; but then we have different problem of an already belligerent and potentially infectious person sitting in a room not set up for isolation for 4+ hours waiting for the test results, the person had to be removed from the clinic.

I work in a clinic with a testing lab that received authorization to perform the test last week, until they received that authorization any swabs collected had to be sent to the CDC for testing. There is a rapid test in development which will essentially make the tests available on-demand, similar to flu or strep tests. Until the on-demand tests are approved and available potential patients have to be exhibiting symptoms, or been traveling within the past 14 days, or been in contact with a person who has been diagnosed/symptomatic/traveling. 

We aren't even letting people who think they might have it into the clinic. People are met at the doors and asked screening questions, if there is any reason to suspect they might have it we are sending them out to their vehicles and a nurse in full PPE comes out and collects a sample from them from their car window and sends them home with orders to self-isolate until the test results are available. We are currently setting up what amounts to drive-thru testing tents in anticipation of the massive influx of patients and the rapid tests. 

We had a person show up to urgent care on Friday who wanted a covid test. They lied to get past the screeners and eventually got into an exam room and told the nurse they wanted a test. They were totally asymptomatic and had no contact with a watch category which meant they could not be tested (because of the time it takes the lab to complete the test not everyone can be tested) but they aggressively demanded to be tested. Eventually a provider gave them a flu swab and told them they didn't have it. If that person actually had covid they could have infected a couple dozen other people because they didn't want to wait in their car for a test. This single person put a huge tax on the system and caused a significant disruption to the case management of other patients.

- He has blamed Giamatti, Vincent, and Selig, refusing to accept responsibility for his actions; 

- He has claimed he didn't read the letter he signed and thought he would automatically get back in after one year; 

- He maintained for a long time that he did not bet on Reds games at all, until he needed to sell a book in 2004 when he admitted to doing it; 

- When presented with hard documentary evidence, namely the bookies books, which showed he was betting as a player he denied it; 

- When he met with Manfred a few years ago and was given the opportunity to plead his case he admitted that he was still betting on baseball.

Pete hasn't done the very minimum required for him to be reinstated, don't bet on baseball. Everything else, the disrespect and the lying and denying responsibility, could be worked around but you can't look past betting on baseball. In 2015 he admitted to Rob Manfred that he was still actively betting on baseball, what was Manfred supposed to do at that point? It's like an alcoholic appearing in court to get custody of his kids while drinking out of a bottle of cheap whiskey in front of the judge. He has had his chances and he has blown them by refusing to do the minimum."

- OSHA.

- Created the Alternative Minimum Tax forcing the wealthy to pay taxes.

The podcast conversation organically drifted somewhere else pretty quickly so there was much exploration of that topic. It’s been on my mind since I heard it. What if that is the play?
