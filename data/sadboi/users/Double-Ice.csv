depression,fevos4q,t3_enrs4c,1579399743.0,"I have been struggling depression for over a year or so. I recently was taken to the ER for psychiatric evaluation. Because I wasnâ€™t having hallucinations or suicidal thoughts,etc. I was sent home without any treatment. But I feel so disconnected and incapable of performing the simplest task. I havenâ€™t been able to hold an employment position for almost 2 years. My family and a dear friend have been supportive, yet no one seem to understand what Iâ€™m mentally going through. After leaving the ER, I felt embarrassed I feel Iâ€™m losing my mind - I am a stroke survivor with no visible physical side effects. I know something is not balanced. I canâ€™t type like I used to therefore I canâ€™t pass a typing test!! No significant income, I have 9 siblings who are doing well for themselves. My spouse of 32 plus years passed suddenly 7 years ago. My life has spiraled downward since then. I havenâ€™t lost all hope but itâ€™s dwindling rapidly. Often, Im told Iâ€™m a strong woman but far from it. I just want to live, laugh and love again. ðŸ’• ðŸ˜¢"
