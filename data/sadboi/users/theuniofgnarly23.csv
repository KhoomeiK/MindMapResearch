relationship_advice,fk50vfc,t3_fgdjw7,1583871338.0,"I suggest you go to the actual police and not college campus authorities. Colleges and Universities tend to be “blind” to sexual assault or sexual harassment cases, and if you go to them, I have a feeling nothing real would get done. When and if you go to the police, have printed pictures of the screenshots you took with you, ESPECIALLY the ones of the girls who admitted to hearing you say “stop”. Don’t write on them, fold them up, etc.; if anyone is allowed to write on them it will be the officers taking your case.
After that, I would suggest ending things and seeking therapy or counseling. What you went through — although not explicitly rape — is just as serious, and emotionally damaging in the same type of way.
As for you: you’re not a “little cry baby bitch” and you’re not at all weak for feeling the way you do. Your girlfriend shouldn’t have let her friend’s stay, and no one but your girlfriend should have placed even a finger on you. The same “no means no” rule applies to girls just as it does to guys. Being a guy doesn’t automatically mean that you can’t be raped, sexually assaulted, or sexually harassed. You were drunk, they didn’t have your permission, yet they still touched you inappropriately. It’s not okay, and I hope that you put yourself before your girlfriend. What she did and allowed them to do wasn’t something you should just go on ignoring like it never happened. You were sexually assaulted, and I’m sorry that you had to go through that.
Stay safe"
