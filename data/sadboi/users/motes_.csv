There was an ""enrichment"" class once a week. I was placed in a small group of kids and every few weeks we did a new activity.
I sewed an apron by hand, made a ceramic Santa and unicorn(together, so odd) drew my name in calligraphy.
I also made a friend. She was in my little group and I noticed she wore THREE watches. I was so intrigued by her.

Eddie is as Eddie does. I love his solo stuff a lot. Therefore I am willing to pay more to see him in a smaller venue.
Times are tough for concert lovers. It is hard to justify the expense of a show when you have other bills to pay.  I remember my first PJ show over 25 years ago. I bought tickets from a scalper and they cost $100/each. My little mind was floored. I haven't bought from a scalper since thanks to their fan club.

I saw my counselor today, verified it is indeed called Lifespan Integration Therapy. 
For me it has worked like this:
One day we went through my life, and she had me give a memory from different ages up until the present. 
Then over the course of my therapy(been doing this over 2 years) we would periodically go through those memories. I close my eyes, she reads my timeline. But we pause at each one, I feel the sensations of those times in my life, only moving on when I am ready. It was heavy work!
The best example is, my 4 year old memory, really brought up so much nervous system feelings of abandonment, not being loved, rejection, fear, etc.
Fast forward to me trying to start a new relationship (notoriously hard for a CPTSD veteran). Full of fears, unconscious defense mechanisms... I came to realize my nervous system felt exactly the same as my 4 year old self. Which I then used those now feelings to basically cradle, communicate, and love child me.
