I got into gardening, I paint whenever I've nothing on my hands, or read.

You really deserve that and I know on the other end they would like to be able to help as much too (hopefully). Maybe you can talk to your therapist about activities that you can manage with your pain in your day to day life to keep your mind and self focused, active and busy so you feel like you're less inside a shell and more present in the day.

HumansBeingBros,fj35i0w,t1_fj2zl1j,1582968300.0,"India won it's independence in 1947. ""Pakistani Muslims"" had plenty of time to move around and actually go to West or even East Pakistan of that time, but some chose not to. They chose to uphold an Indian citizenship, making them Indian Muslims. It's not that difficult"
HumansBeingBros,fj359vh,t1_fj2za2s,1582967966.0,"I think India was kind of known pretty non secular ever since Indira Gandhi and her administration let thousands of Sikh families, communities and businesses burn and die. Which is exactly why this post means so much to me. It is a perfect example of solidarity in India even amongst the monstrosity. It is funny, because neither Pakistan nor Bangladesh seem to carry out daylight violence against minorities living in their own country. Bangladesh calls itself a secular country, it's in their constitution to protect and allow every citizen to follow whatever religion, and also has government approved holidays for Bangladeshi-Hindu/Christian citizens. No protest/civil fight between religious groups has ever been facilitated and supported by their own government. To watch others celebrate their love for God in their own ways is pretty darn beautiful.

You're absolutely right. Muslims rather not differentiate themselves as much as to kill one another on sects or even have a socio-economic strata created based around it. If you look at Hinduism, it promotes the caste systems even today and have strict standards within lineages to honor each caste a specific place in the society, beginning from Brahmans. Christians have different churches, and different sects themselves. Which is absolutely fine, my buddy. You do you, so does everyone else. Freedom of religion. 

Lastly, in my personal opinion, any Prime minister that shakes his hand in solidarity to deal in arms and ammunition and shares similar ideologies to Trump is someone to be wary of. Please have more compassion for people who are not different than you rather than choosing to highlight miniscule differences."
HumansBeingBros,fj2wq6b,t1_fj2wdd4,1582956751.0,So killing minorities of different religious backgrounds isn't a violation of human rights?

It centers my attention back to the healing I have to do from hearing obscene things as a kid. I think it's almost like helping the child in me heal, so I can be more mindful of where/who/how I am now purely based on facts, and not the voices in my head.

bipolar2,fipqrg3,t1_fipoxdu,1582616862.0,"Is that how they responded or is that your general feeling after opening up to them? I'm sorry if my questioning is invasive, but I struggle with that too. It makes me become reclusive from people in my life who are ready to hold a space for me, so I can unload, dump, whatever you want to call it. But often enough I do this mind reading thing on the person and quickly judge from the circumstances and my misery vomit that I've inconvenienced them/somehow dumped more than they can handle?

But truly, and realistically, some people can truly and effectively hold space for you, me, and anyone else struggling, simply out of care or because they have the capacity to. You must be able to trust yourself and the person you unwind to, to do that for you. And you must trust that if it ever overwhelms them, they will tell you. Not efficient communication on their part is not your fault. This requires efficient communication from your end when wanting to open upto somebody, so they know what journeys you have to manage everyday to be you.

selfimprovement,fhpaze0,t3_f45rty,1581785456.0,"Hi there. First and foremost, please don't beat yourself up for English not being your native language. Interestingly enough, I saw a data set somewhere that English is now the most spoken language in the world by non-native speakers. As far as I can read, you have conveyed your thoughts very well :)

Language differences can act as a huge barrier to getting your desired education, and as a non-native English speaker myself, I understand that. I have to pay more attention, twice the amount, to sometimes read a difficult material and process it. 

You have so much potential. After high school, it is a shared emotion to feel lost, completely useless, or out of touch with your passions, your dreams that you want to pursue in higher education. Discipline is a good skill set, but it won't work if you have very little motivation. I want to tell you so many stories of non-native English speakers from my country in Asia who travel all over the world, and don't let their shortcomings stop them from achieving their daily goals. It's like they have an armor on with a smile. They go out there attending to the matters they love indulging in the most, whether it be a philosophy class, a conference, a day at work.  

Set daily goals. Start small. Maybe waking up on a set time everyday. A planner and planning 3-4 days ahead in time always helps. Don't do the same tasks everyday, allocate different tasks for each day. I would say start reading books, and news articles. Maybe not political if that's a trigger, but articles from credible sources online. If you don't like reading books, maybe watch movies, then read the script of the movie. Since you love philosophy, there are some great videos on Youtube that have great + visual breakdowns of philosophical concepts, schools of thoughts, etc. 

Do it not because you have to, but because you would love to. That's my motto.

I hope this helps even in the slightest. Have a good day fellow redditor."
enneagram6,fho34so,t3_eis1pn,1581739921.0,"Hi. I'm 23 and a 6w5. I ended a month (minus a day) long group therapy with some kind people who became my friends and mentors over time. I found myself there after a manic episode and confessing to my outside doctors/therapists about sh. 

My biggest take away has been three things. One, I must trust that the world is a safe place. This goes beyond any subtype, that we must be able to trust, as our first true instinct, instead of looking at our surroundings with distrust, which inevitably would always induce a sense of panic and nervousness in me, and I would fall behind in actually experiencing a joyous moment. Or even the reality, as it is. Second, it has brought me closer to Allah. I moved away from religion for a very long time, and somehow without having a sense of a higher being who means well for mankind, it did help me begin to create a sense of accountability, but it felt like an entire world dropped on my shoulders. I'm human. I have had to accept so much guilt and shame, mistakes and regrets, but if I had to believe I can truly be capable of change, of acceptance, of love, I had to pray again. And it calms my mind so much. It's my form of meditation now. Thirdly, I have to and am learning to love myself. I've loved, loved so much, so many friends, family, lovers, nature, but not myself. Somewhere, I felt I am not worthy of that love. That's distorted thinking. God, regardless of any religion, The Creator, created you and flowers. Created you, and clouds, water and fire. Created life and death.  Buddhism teaches me to not identify with my feelings, but rather identify with the item that exists. We have so much more in common with each component in this world, than differences. Think from the perspective of someone overlooking from space, outside Earth. 

20's are an ugly time. That's the sense I gather from here. But the only thing you can control against the tide of life is your mind. Your sense of security, that your mind can decide. I really pray for your safety, and ease in these matters as days go by. If you ever need a support friend, someone to reach out to, please leave me a message. But be more gentle on yourself. Much power to you for opening up here x"

Yes. yes. I guess a major component of Buddhism is helping me to not identify with my thoughts or feelings about ""things"" but rather identify with ""things"" itself. Feelings and thoughts are fleeting emotions but we have more in common with ""things"" rather than differences. Our brain just likes to focus on differences because somehow having consciousness gives us (or me, will try not to generalize) the idea that maybe we're unique or entirely lonely.. but we're not. Maybe things are an illusion, then maybe so am I. Maybe things are real, then so am I. Either way, we all deserve to be respected, be respectful, kind and loving before feeling adverse."
infj,fgq32wf,t3_ezpfbq,1581016942.0,"I have done that, time and time again. In the process damaged or screwed up a lot of friendships and relationships.

Personally, I spent too long not pleasing my true self, and the people I once felt safe, compassionate with. 

As Infjs' we can have a good understanding and fluidity to adapting or almost morphing into certain personalities in certain situations/around certain people. My fatalist self would bring out the worst in me to start mimicking the ugly that would be thrown at me. But that is and was my unhealthiest trait.

infj,fgmyvvj,t3_ezdb0p,1580934569.0,"Hello fellow INFJ twin. Currently struggling with my social life, family and interpersonal relationships because of everything you just explained. I'm working on making /small talks/ right now. I realize it can come off as a bit rude or ""looking entitled"" when I don't share or am deciding intuitively who to share with and/or when. But it's a long process to explain to people when I'm in public spaces and need to \~express and receive\~.

 I do look for equality in my partner. I don't focus too much on dating per se, again because I rely much on intuition on whether I feel a certain degree of safety or compassion to create an open space like that between myself and the other hooman. I've had failed relationships because my perfectionist or controlling nature takes over, but I don't let it make me feel down or lose hope, I believe it will happen when it has to. I do however have been called out on being the ""stoic"" or ""masc"" in past dynamics, but again I don't like being put in a box or have my hooman put in a ""fem"" or ""unstoic"" box because I despise the gender quo and stereotypes. I like to not apply much of it as I grow older.

However, I love people. I love listening, sharing, when I do find it in me to connect. It is my favorite ""hobby"" I guess, besides others. I have held a strong dislike for I guess ""household chores"" for a while, simply because I grew up in a society where it is mostly expected from ""girls"" to do that, and I've seen my mom hate days when she had to do most of it alone and have no help. But helping her helped me realize my society should not determine when and how I should clean my house simply because, it's dirt = clean dirt = stay and keep a healthy environment.
