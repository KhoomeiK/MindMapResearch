After Kravin teamed up with John, they both changed. John's much more fun to watch now, but Kravin can get a bit grating at times. They rubbed off on each other. With Mark and Ethan, I feel it's much more like Mark is reliving his chaotic younger days because Ethan is younger, even though he's also a precious boy.

The problem is that Mark has made *great strides* from his earlier stuff, as had Felix (before he removed most of his channel to start over), so going back to that is rubbing a lot of us the wrong way. If the Grumps deleted everything Jon-era or Steam Train related people would pitch a fit.

Your best bet is the Underground/Caverns layer with a desert/corruption overlap for a shot at all four, but if that's a bit much, remember you can put \~250 sand just off-screen in a 25x10 or 50x5 block to simulate a desert biome. Beyond that, it's all patience and luck. Good hunting."

Pokemon Moon. I was so hyped for that game when it came out, got burnt out almost immediately, came back to it months later and just didn't care. The hand holding was obscene ([not that handholding](https://www.reddit.com/r/handholding/)) and EV training was completely neutered. Gyms... trials...? were stock and boring and the opposing Pokemon was usually one-shot because I run a varied team and know how to capitalize on a weakness. The rival didn't exist, the story didn't exist, and when I looked up if the endgame is worth it, **it doesn't exist.**The fashion sucked, the characters sucked, the island system, I couldn't care less about, and the obstacles in your path were so clearly 'oh you'll get this thing later', but upon getting the thing, going back was meaningless.
