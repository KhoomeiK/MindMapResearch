If you keep going, you'll end up stumbling over the right people who fit your real you. And you'll be okay.

You will have a good life and be the real you. Just keep holding on and doing your best!"

TrollXChromosomes,fqkmyxw,t1_fqklbnc,1589430972.0,"That was a fun discussion to have. I used the ""I have always been AnonymousPlatypus, for all my life. It's my identity. I don't want to give that up. But if you feel that this isn't a real marriage unless we have the same name, why don't you take mine?"".

It did lead to a productive talk about the whole issue, though and ended with us agreeing we would probably hyphenate (his last name is pretty long. I have two middle names. I dread filling out forms.) because we both have legitimate reasons not to give up our last names (he has plans to resurrect a family business and wants it to have the same name, I want to keep my name for similar reasons).
Or maybe we'll be evil, both keep our last names and just hyphenate our kids. Let them deal with the hyphenated length! 😁"
NoStupidQuestions,fqkmdrn,t1_fqi0ne5,1589430568.0,"That's the way it was for me - my mom was always very calm about sexuality and super good at simply explaining things to me and my ""hey, sex Ed isn't super comprehensive and doesn't cover relationships"" - book was very direct about ""you may want to rub genitals with people with similar genitals, go ahead but hey, there's stuff to prevent stds for that too!"" and ""you may wish to exchange your genitals for a different set or none, here's some resources to look up"" (gender is more complicated than that, but they were pretty far ahead at that time with that view....) and I just never felt that it would be any kind of issue.
I always knew no matter who I brought home, as long as they treated me well, they would be loved. With the exception of aunt Karen and her brood my whole family is like that. If you're a partner (or even just a good friend) to one of us and you're decent, you get immediately absorbed into the family and offered any and all support we can muster. It's pretty amusing to watch people experience the first big gathering and the inevitable ""absorption"" by both biological and chosen family members. They can be a bit much (my fiance is finally, finally about to get the full experience (pending corona) and I will bask in his suffering), but they care and if asked to take it easy, they will.

My favorite cousin summed it up once as ""he loves you. How can I not like him?"".

That's all that should count."

ADHD,fqkgnal,t3_gj9j53,1589426882.0,"Lifereminders comes to mind. Iirc, it is made by someone from this sub and designed for adhd.
You can set it up (iirc it's the default, even) so that notifications are really, really annoyingly persistent, beeping and popping up every five minutes until you do, in fact, Mark them complete. It supports fancy scheduling and all kinds of stuff.

It's not a task tracker per se, though, so it would either require some tweaking or you could use it as a reminder for checking your chores."

ADHD,fqkgaw5,t3_gjar4x,1589426670.0,"If I could have a medication pump that kept me at the same level all day every day, I would.
I just don't get the whole ""you should only be medicated when you need to be productive"" - thing.
When I'm not medicated, I'm terrible at doing anything, even the things I want to do. I can't switch between things properly, I have issues listening closely, I have issues reading for leisure, small things like picking up clothes after taking them off is way harder, I have massive issues with getting into the shower, I lose track of time and, as you mentioned - I fall asleep much better when I'm medicated while doing so and I feel like a break is a break when I'm medicated.

So yes: all the meds, all the time.
I believe if you tell your therapist what you wrote down for us, especially the part about rest and sleep, she should be fine with your idea."

I know we have a regular (finance-guy) who posts specific destructions of earning models for some of the mlms on his website, but I don't know if he's done kangen.

I feel like your best bet might be to try and get your hands on an income statement and/or an actual medical review."
