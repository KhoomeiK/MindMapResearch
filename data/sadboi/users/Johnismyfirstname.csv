photography,fq1945y,t3_gg8o0v,1589043423.0,"""Straight out of the camera""  is a very misleading phrase. 

EVERYTHING is processed in some way. 

The light goes in, hits the sensor, the sensor processes the light, (different sensors process it differently) next the camera processes the sensor data. Depending on your settings it will process it differently. Vivid, neutral, portrait, sharpening, contrast, active d lighting ( Nikon name for bumping up shadows), etc etc 
(RAW is a bit different I think) 

After that it's saved ( aka processed) into a file format. Different formats use different algorithms.

Next how are you going to view this image? If it's printed then there is some more processing. If it's staying on a screen then maybe it's done, but maybe not depending on file formats, optimizing for different gamuts, etc. 

Now shooting raw is a bit different. I think the camera doesn't apply the picture settings before saving but I could be wrong. You still need to process it later to get it on a screen or printed though. 

Using film? Yah it's still processed, just in the darkroom. 

On that note, ""Straight out of the camera"" feels appropriate if someone hands you a roll of film."
