TrueOffMyChest,fh8e802,t1_fh83c0z,1581357864.0,"I'm sure I've been clear and consice but somehow you've managed to misinterpret my point entirely.

Theres a tldr at the end but if you could read the whole thing then that'd be great - I really sincerely want your criticism and comments so that I can understand this all better.

As a human you deserve the basic rights of evry other human. Personally I believe every person does deserve love and understanding, but not universal accommodation because of a mental-health condition. It's not hatespeech and abuse and derogatory to not do so. Why does your alleged inescapable need to be a gender other than male or female mean I have to adopt new individualised pronouns and respect that? Even more than that, there's the claim that one doesn't have to have gender-dysphoria to warrant commanding respect of what would thusly be a selfish and arbitrary identity that tasks everyone you meet with doing you a favour.

Ive spoken to a couple people in the past who transitioned and they said that if they didn't have the reassignment surgery then they probably would've killed themselves. Those sorts of people tend to resent those who blow-up transgenderism into a movement that aims to reshape society. These people just want to be women or men, and usually try to be particularly feminine or masculine so as to minimise the possibility of people treating them like their former gender.

The main issue I have is with the notion that it should be mandated by laws such as hate-speech and assault that I should lift even a finger to accommodate someone's aberrations.

I don't have a problem with homosexuality since it doesn't imply anything that controvenes my rights. There are no eggshells there that aren't implicit in the idea. Transgenderism though for many people seems to mean others must address them by a set of pronouns that they have fabricated. I think that if someone who wishes for their public identity to be something other than what society bestows upon them, then they must make a case publically for it that is accepted at the discretion of the public, not mandated by law. In the case of transgenders, for me this would mean making an effort to fit in with the pertinant gender norms to some degree.

Look, I understand that there are many idiots in the world who don't accept the idea of transitioning, gender reassignment, etc, and actively try to cause suffering to those who just want to transition with, optimally, minimal duress to anyone else. The idiots I'm talking about don't just have stipulations but outright condemn trangenders despite the fact that it doesn't necessarily cause them any trouble.

Seriously, I wanna love and respect you as a human, but I really don't see a sufficient justification for saying I'm hateful for not using pronouns - that are effectively specific to you - if you can't present me with any evidence that the identity is physically real (aka is biological and immutable like homosexuality)

I'm rambling a bit here Ik, but I want to make sure I get my whole point across.

There are loads of transgenders who go through reassignment surgery to fit in culturally. The dichotomy male and female is always gonna be there, so long as a penis is going into a vagina, ya know? Masculine and feminine goes a lot deeper psychologically than the actual idea of gender. You could probably find studies which show how people whos' lives and relationships are void of masculinity and feminity are way more likely to become depressed. Relationships don't even function without the two genders being embodied to some degree by each person. No one is exclusively masculine or feminine, but no one has personality traits that aren't easily identifiable as one or the other.

It's such a useful distinction to make between actions as M and F constitute the grounding for how people interact with eachother.

TL;DR
What I'm trying to get across here is that feeling like you're not the gender the nurse assigned you when your mother went for her scan, does not mean you aren't. We all have things about us that we don't like but I am that thing all the same. If I decide I'm a concert pianist, am I? There's criteria that must be met, and if I don't meet that criteria then I'm not one. The idea of ""concert pianist"" was established because it was a useful distinction yeh? Man and woman, XX XY, masculine and feminine, are ideas that all reference eachother in their definitions, and ARE defined well enough to warrant status as distinct ideas. They're concepts that run deeper than the idea of gender as we understand it and of newly invented genders with new pronouns like ze and zer, yet they're equated as if they are intrinsically tied to biology. It shouldn't shock you to know that M and F are one of those concepts which emerges in the same fashion as the idea a newborn has of crying when it leaves the womb.

Given all this, can you see why people get so defensive about having to identify someone who for all intents and purposes acts and looks like a man by a different gender. It's a bit unreasonable to enforce a certain idea on them as if it should be accepted in the same fashion as their cis gender identity. You've gotta make the effort to convince them that it's worth their effort, and not just make it your personal human right to dictate your own identity."

Why should I respect someone's made up gender? Why should I accommodate their troublesome idiosyncrasies just because they expect me to? Wheres the reasoning behind considering something which imposes undue responsibility on me as an entitlement of every human?

Every right ever made is something that is a benefit for all, not just a few. Your right is my responsibility, so it's not fair when I don't get any benefit from that right.
If someone has an idiosyncracy that is prevelent in only a small minority of people and the accommodation of which will be of concequence to everyone else, then it is a disorder, not a normal acceptable facet of humanity. Its your burden to bare, and if you can't manage your dysphoria with a solution that doesn't involve everyone working around you, then you're just gonna have to suffer to some extent. That's life. Should we indulge schizophrenic delusion, or narcissistic self-engrandisement because it makes them dysphoric?
