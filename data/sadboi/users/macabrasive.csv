RATS,fqib3rz,t1_fqiasgq,1589393616.0,That's the hard part right now is finding a single male rat who's around his age. The major chain of pet stores apparently has a female-only policy (which makes me wonder where the males end up ... ) I've been looking at private breeders but they'll only sell pairs as well. I will find him a buddy.

RATS,fqg5bn1,t3_giqe3c,1589338300.0,"He was a feeder rat so he’s super young - about 5/6 weeks. I went to go get him a buddy today and the pet store said wait cause he’s super young. 

I bought him a massive three level cage with a ton of toys and pellets and veggies and fruit. 

I’ve never had a pet that’s sooooo snuggly - I’ve never had a rat before! I can’t believe how much he just wants to be around me. Every time I try to put him down somewhere he just scurries back up my arm and onto my neck. He sleeps in my hoodie hood for hours while I work. 

I’m in love lol.

UPDATE: He has a play date tomorrow at 11 with a breeder to pick out his new brother."

The only foods that were left yesterday were organic versions. All the veggie/vegan meats raided. The three trucks Walmart unpacked did nothing.
