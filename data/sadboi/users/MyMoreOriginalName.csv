BDSMcommunity,fq70x5e,t1_fq6zqpa,1589140357.0,"Oh for sure. It’s not my therapy and I’m very aware of that. it’s just sometimes the CPTSD crosses paths with my kink interests in unexpected ways. I actually go see a therapist once a week, but have been looking for a new therapist as of late, so I’m glad to know there are kink friendly therapists. 

I also had the issue of believing my issues were just anxiety based but once my therapist pointed out that all my anxieties seemed to start with some sort of trigger from my past it became clear it wasn’t that."
BDSMcommunity,fq650xy,t3_gflsvv,1589124629.0,"I have recently discovered I deal with CPTSD, and I find it interesting that around the same time I started exploring BDSM. it’s been an interesting dichotomy but also at times scary. Im not really good at managing my emotional flashbacks and I’m finding that there’s a fine line of what I enjoy in BDSM and my various triggers of emotional flashbacks. So it’s been running in my mind if BDSM has been a safe and healthy thing for me. In certain ways it has been safe. BDSM has been an overall good experience and I feel it’s is helping dealing with some of my traumas in a lot of ways. my partner and I are communicating well enough to be able to mitigate a lot of the issues so I’m happy about that."

I certainly often feel like a burden, and I have asked myself if I feel that way because I’m trying to keep away from conflict or at least keep conflict to a minimum. I don’t know. It’s almost always internally that I say sorry. But I am known to say sorry quickly when it comes to conflicts even if I feel I was justified in the conflict."

BDSMcommunity,fmpewum,t3_fw0g5s,1586279612.0,"Hello! I'm 28F who has been interested in BDSM for years but am now only exploring it with  a wonderful girl whom i'm dating who has been in the community for a year now. She has been my sort of ""in"" to a lot of this, but i'm still kinda shy at times when it comes to the local community. 

I have a bit of a vent i guess. Maybe i can get some advice? The biggest thing is that we are both sub in nature. Our relationship outside of play is flourishing. I have seriously never been as happy with someone as i am now. She seems to have a bit of a confidence issue though and so there are times in social situations where i have to take lead for her, which generally i'm a-ok with. And in contrast we do some social stuff here and there like her making me wear my collar pretty much at all times, which has been fun for me, but it seems we have a dynamic of where we mostly live on equal ground when it comes to life. And that seems to be perfect for both of us.

but when it comes to play itself we have been kind of making it work, but i feel like some problems are going to introduce themselves soon. since she has a whole lot more practice then i do, she is essentially taking the roll of dom, in an attempt for me to kind learn as a sub how to be dom for her at times in the future. I've tried domming once so far, and she seemed to enjoy herself, and i didn't hate the experience, although due to past trauma's it difficult for me to get into the dom headspace. 

Even more, i'm finding myself intoxicated with being the sub so much that i'm finding I want more. While she says she is finding it fun to dom me, i have a feeling she is likely not as comfortable with being dom as she is telling me... although there are times recently where she excelled at it and seemed to enjoy it. I think she needs time but i'm honestly getting a bit bored (as selfish as that sounds) at times when the play sessions don't seem to be very different and threats of punishments seem to always ring hallow. My personality is such that i enjoy being playful and i enjoy the back and forth in conversation that i have with her. And as a result of all of this, it seems i have started to take on a bratty sub personality (or maybe ive always been?). Which my GF has mentioned she wasn't a fan of. At the end of the day, i feel that my brattyness is mostly due to me just wanting more. but there's a whole lot more to it that i will save for another conversation.

There are points where i want to suggest things or i get into my bratty mode in an attempt to meet my needs at the time. and there are times where it just comes out. but I feel shitty at times because i feel sometimes my nudgings are coming across as forceful or unwanted. I realize she might not enjoy it as much as i do, and i realize that it might be wrong of me to put her in this situation that she may not feel comfortable with and so i plan to have a big conversation later so we can redefine what it is we want. But i feel there are times she isn't telling me the full story. Not telling me how she really feels, which i think is because of how some ex's treated her in the past. So i hope i can come across that I want her to communicate with me and be honest and not be afraid to be honest.

But to you all, is there anyone with any kind of advice for me?"

My personal experience is that at the end of the week I feel quite drained and so I’m quite happy to do my next injection. Before this we have both done the same dosage minus her on spiro and finasteride and me being on progesterone.

CPTSD,fmgu9jg,t1_fmgtqaw,1586057992.0,Yes. I have a therapist I normally see weekly. He kinda helped me come to the conclusion in the first place.

My therapist has been sick (thankfully not COVID) these past two weeks so I’ve been without a therapist for at least two weeks. So it’s been a struggle to figure this all out.

lgbt,fibbgti,t1_fibael8,1582318474.0,"Yeah, i get that. I'm not a lawyer either, to be fair, but i don't think there's anything legally binding them to report a possible suicide. But from their site, they do follow a caveat in that:

  ""While we do not engage in non-consensual active rescue, the Hotline reserves the right to report any call containing credible threats of violence to others and to comply with laws regarding suspected child abuse and neglect.""

The other thing is they will call police or medical services if the person calling it requests it. They have a lot of more information on non-consensual active rescue here:  [https://www.translifeline.org/blog/post/why-no-active-rescue](https://www.translifeline.org/blog/post/why-no-active-rescue)"
lgbt,fib7w8w,t1_fib51y4,1582316420.0,Yes. Mainly because theres an extra element of danger for trans people when it comes to police. Especially for trans POC.
lgbt,fiazvfx,t1_fiavcd6,1582311736.0,"To put it bluntly, trans people dont feel safe calling into the national hotline. 

But trans lifeline has a few advantages for trans people over the normal national suicide hotline. The biggest being that its only staffed by trans people. It helps trans people keep at ease in moments of crisis. Also, due to the general publics lack of knowledge on trans people, a trans person may not get the best advice or help they need or there may be other issues which would only serve to worsen their situation. With it being staffed by only trans people there is a much bigger incentive for trans people to call in. 

The other advantage is that trans lifeline does not call police unless i believe one of two conditions are made. That being if the person calling in requests it, or if the person is absoluetly an immediate danger to other people. This is key. Police brutality twoards trans people is quite high, and often times the normal national suicide hotline will pull the trigger on calling the police much easier. 

Trans lifeline is important because it creates a space where trans people can call in and not worry if they are going to be discriminated against (wheather intentional by the agent or not) or have cops called on them when in some cases the trans person is just looking for a way to calm down. Many trans people wont call into most hotlines for the afformentioned reasons, but this organization gives incentive to, and helps lessen the amount of trans people commiting suicide.

Im severly grateful to that organization. They have helped me a lot in the past."

Add on that tramatic stress from being yelled at by virtually everyone about it...it becomes a nasty cyclical patern.

Prog has certainly helped with sleep, which is great. I believe my mood has been better in general too.

 But my biggest plus so far is that its helped me gain weight. Ive always struggled to keep weight on me and i believe its led to my breasts not really developing well. But on prog i have been way more inclined to eat and have gained a few pounds, and it seems most of that is going to my breasts.

Often times, when it gets that far i have a difficult time logically thinking or reacting. If anything speaks out to me it's that i recently got a taste of what its like to want to live starting about two years ago. My curiosity to see where things go from here and the feeling that i feel alive for the first time in my life have kept me from acting upon it.

About four years ago I quit that hobby due to being infuriated by nerd drama, it’s expensive upkeep, my dislike for the meta gaming the cards presented, and in general not having many people to play it with  casually (I didn’t care for the pro scene) when moving back home. I replaced that hobby with something I could enjoy more by myself: Vinyl. But it left me with hundreds of cards, some incredibly valuable and some rising in price. At the suggestion of my girlfriend, who is still an avid player, she thought maybe I should sell them. Not  personally feeling like going through the method of selling them individually myself, she recommended a place she used to go to in philly called digital underground which is a hobby shop that sells magic the gathering, warhammer, and other games of the sort but also has an interesting selection of records, mostly in the post-punk alternative vein. Lucky for me, that’s my favorite genre of music, and going there I immediately found records that I just needed to have. Additionally I got a few records for Christmas from my girlfriend, a record from MAGfest 2020 (which I happened to go to this year), and a long awaited preorder.  This list also doesn’t include another preorder I got with the money from selling the cards: the Failure 1992 – 1996 Box set, which I am very excited to get later this year.

From top left to right going down:

1. Skies Of Arcadia – Eternal Soundtrack box set:  Both me and my girlfriend wanted this one, and so we each paid half for it. I’m a huge fan of the Dreamcast and Skies and so is she, so it made sense for both of us to put the money down on something we both enjoyed. This is just the normal blue varient, but it’s still incredibly beautiful sounding.

2. Carpenter Brut – Trilogy: I am incredibly excited for this one. I’m a big fan of synthwave and darkwave music, and Carpenter Brut is imo, one of the greats in the scene. Trilogy is an absolutely bonkers 3 record set that compiles his first three releases into one gloriously fun and beautiful record.

3. Glass Beach – The First Glass Beach Record: This one was a pre-order from a bit ago and it hands down my AOTY of 2019. It’s a really sweet, tender, and chaotic album that combines a “diverse set of musical influences including punk, emo, jazz, earlyh synthesizer music, and new wave” It’s hard to really describe it, but if you like emo or things in the vain of Jeff Rosenstock/ Bomb the Music Industry but with jazz and synth, then you will probably really dig this record.

4. Pink Turns Blue – If two worlds kiss: one of my very favorite classic post punk/ drakwave bands and my favorite record by them. I really enjoy this record, nothing much more to say about that though.

5. The Soft Moon – self titled: The soft moon is such a cool band! I already have my two favorite records by them in my collection, but am working on getting the rest. Couldn’t pass this one off for the life of me. If post-punk with an industrial feel is a sound you are interested in, these folks are the tops.

6. Unwound – Rat Conspiricy: bought this one through discogs. This is my second unwound box set, with “No Energy” being my first. This set compiles two of their records (new plastic ideas and fake train) and adds a bonus record with odds and ends from the sessions during that time period. They are an early post-hardcore band (a genre that I have found to be more enjoyable in the older days compared to more recently) and are considered by some to be incredibly inspirational for the scene. To me, I always thought of them as a hardcore version of pinback….maybe that’s not a fair assessment, but I love both.

7. Scars on broadway - self titled: This was $5 new. I admit I actually loved this record when it came out. It’s been a hot minute since I listened to it, but I still remember a lot of the songs and their lyrics. Can’t beat the price.

8. The Chameleons – What does anything mean basically?: I love the chameleons, and finding any records by them anywhere near me is insanely difficult. I could not pass this opportunity off. This is the recent reprint with the clear variant.

9. Jeff Rosenstock – I look like shit: One of my all time favorites by Jeff, his cover of I don’t want to Die by the Ging Nang Boyz is one of my standout favorite songs he has ever done. Can’t recommend him more if you like diy punk. This was a gift from my girlfriend!

10. Mother 2 Soundtrack (starman variant): this one was picked up at MAGfest 2020. This is a soundtrack to a classic SNES game. If you aren’t familiar with the name you may be familiar with the US name: Earthbound! I love this soundtrack, it’s so weird and strange and at times familiar but with an offset tone, much like the tone of the game itself. it’s Wacky and fun.

11. Bomb the music industry – Scrambles and Get Warmer: I’m gonna put these two together. I LOVE BOMB. Scambles is my second favorite record by them (I own my all time fav, Vacation, already) and Get Warmer is my girlfriends favorite. We both got each other a copy. A note, the scrambles record jacket is a neat idea but it’s one of the flimsiest jackets I have ever seen. It’s just a glossy thin paper material that just kinda folds over the record. It would have worked better if it was cardboard or something of the sort."
Protomen,fdo8nku,t3_emaulf,1578600797.0,I have seen them so many times in the past and this was easily my favorite time seeing them. They really brought it home hard this time. I had an absolute blast!

I think its their fiercest record as far as their sound goes. And Dripping being the other record in my personal pile trinity. I certainly enjoy all the records and like green and gray as well. But those three are easily my most played records (not counting odds and ends which also gets a lot of love from me) of the whole set.

Now my sister isnt the worst person in the world, she isnt biggoted and does care. But a few years before i came out i moved completely across the US to live with her for a time and then get on my own feet. During that time she betrayed my feelings when, in a moment of crisis, i tried to explain to her that i needed to help. I didnt say the words hospitial...but i should've. Instead of taking me seriously she told me it wasnt her problem and i needed to grow up. I felt dejected and, unknowingly to her, tried to kill myself. But I ended up not doing so and moved back to my home state without explaining just why.

Ever since then ive been bitter, and i dont believe ill ever fully trust her like i once did. She still has no idea why i moved back but i just dont feel safe giving her that information. And so when it came time to come out, i initially told the family and friends who were major parts of my life. But i didnt tell her. When i came out on facebook she soon found out that most of the immediate family already knew and she blew up on me. 

I learned then that people like her dont see their own faults. Her mindset was ""always right"", and regardless of what i did there would likely be backlash. I admit i could have been more clear to her about everything, but i dont see her the same way i used to, and i likely never will. I expect your stepfather will have some kind of backlash. At the end of the day, You will want to figure out which option minimizes the amount of drama and go from there."

AskMtFHRT,fao0pnm,t3_ea692v,1576254896.0,"This is a follow up to a previous post from last week.

We had established that my E levels are good, if not slightly high, and that my T is a bit lower than it should be but at the very least suppressed.

I have since gone to my doctor. It turns out my previous NP who sees me has been replaced by a new one, but there’s an issue. She only tests for testosterone levels and basic stuff like calcium, potassium, etc.

I asked why, mentioning that it would make more sense to test estrogen too in order to get a better understanding of it all. Her response was that they like to base it on how the patient feels with the progress of feminization, and the testosterone levels. They adjust accordingly to that. And they don’t follow a reference range for Estrogen because there is “no exact proof” of what levels are good for each person. I get what she’s saying, but I think this is a dangerous approach and not even a well rounded one. But she won’t really budge on it. So the only test results I have to share this time is my testosterone. And as you can see it’s a measly 3 ng/dl. I want to note that this result is after me missing a day of injection to get closer to my trough levels, so even after waiting 8 days to take my injection, it seems my testosterone is incredibly tanked.

Someone mentioned to me last time that dropping spiro might be a good move. I’m not against it. Getting rid of that daily nuisance and removing the dizzy spells from my life sounds like a net positive in my mind, but I wanted to see what others thought here one more time.

Some good news:

She did sign on with Progesterone though and was very willing to prescribe that. I’m getting 100 mg of micronized bioidentical progesterone (which she said would be able to raise it to 200mg if needed), which I will be taking rectally as recommended by so many others.

I’m excited to try, but I’m a bit worried to read that it’s difficult to stop if it doesn’t work well for me. But I’m of the school of thought that it’s worth a shot at the very least. But is progesterone ok take with my T so low? I want to be fair here, I’m aware that progesterone is not very strong in that category, but I’m unsure currently if Prog helps lower or just suppress T. Also, should I have gone with 200 mg instead of 100?

Some Other issues:

I discussed my penile atrophy with the doctor, and even mentioned the topical testosterone cream. She agreed with me that Viagra was not the option given the amount of pain I go through when I am erect. But she said she didn’t really have any other option to help me with that as all the ideas were speculative at best. She didn’t want to give the topical testosterone because she was afraid it would raise my testosterone. I have read it doesn’t really raise it by that much and considering my incredibly low T, I don’t think it would be a detriment to me overall. Especially considering how debilitating the atrophy is when it comes to my relationship. I don’t want to give up Transition, but I also don’t want to have to experience this pain all the time. Should I look into doing that part DIY? My doctor asked if I was interested in bottom surgery, and I do plan to do that, but I’m not ready mentally to go forward with that as I’m only just picking up pieces of my shattered mental state from before transition. I also worry that when the time comes, I won’t have enough skin to even get one deep enough to use, something I do want to pursue. At the end of it all, she told me there wasn't much she could do.

Needless to say, I’m already talking to a new provider for a second opinion.

TLDR for those not interested in the long sap story;

Very low testosterone going to drop Spiro likely. Good course of action?

Progesterone: should I start with 100 mg or 200 mg? will it be ok with my T being so low?

Penile atrophy: intense pain, debilitating when I’m erect, doctor won’t prescribe Topical testosterone. DIY? What do?"

If i misunderstood, then sorry, but I dont think its fair that you are aiming this directly at all pan people. Im pan and i have a solid reason for identifying as such over bi. here is how i see the definition of the two:

Bi: being attracted to two or more genders

Pan: having no major preference in attraction between genders.

These seem to be the popular definition. And honestly it makes sense to me. By that definition I agree that I do not think bi people exclude GNC people. But the definition of bi based on this begs a question: ""well, if its two or more, then which ones?"". I dont think this is a good way of asking but we still get people who will ask that. Where as pan is a simple straight forward, i have no preference, and its dropped as such. Sure there are some pan people who may think bi only includes strictly men and women. But i have run into enough bi people who define it as such as well. We should all work to unifying the definitions of bi and pan so everyone is on the same level."
