Jump ahead 19 years, I gave up on my teeth looking normal, then went to the dentist about 7 months ago, they did all the scans and showed me what my teeth would look like when all done. At 36 I started crying in the dentist office cuz for the first time in my life I had hope I would finally have straight teeth.

About 7 months ago my journey started, I'm on tray 20/22 currently. I'm shifting to refinements and some IPR next week to wrap it all up, hopefully just a few sets of trays and minimal attachments this go. I thought my teeth were a lost cause.

I typically brush and floss after every meal, but to take them out when drinking or avoiding curries because of fear of staining these things is kinda crazy. My attachments weren't even stained. I had them on for 6+ months and never noticed anything. And I had them on almost all top teeth and several bottoms. Honestly, I never saw what the big deal was with any of it.

My homeboy moved out here to come work for an MMTC in their cultivation Dept and is slowly but surely helping them to dial in their processes better and better each day. It sounds like a lot of these companies are running on old properties that were retooled to grow cannabis and are just now beginning to sink teeth in with their money and start building up their operations to grow it properly. I'm excited to try the MAC1 the batch I put order in for is at 25%+ so I'm hoping that means that they dialed in their curing and light leak problems, or this was grown in a completely different way. Based on resin production in previous pics it looks like with their MAC1 and some others they went from light dep to indoor. Makes me happy. There's no comparison when it comes to the two in my opinion, you just simply cannot get resin production any other way."

I also had to waste a quarter of PCK from Vidacann as it moldy and Rotted. 

That made me even more sad because the first batch of PCK I ever got from Vidacann was so potent, so perfect. Like it absolutely checked every box I needed it to on my medication list and then I went back a few months later and it was total bunk. I had the same batch # as a lot of ppl on here who had rot and mold, so I know a lot of ppl went through it and it's a little harder to see than seeds unless you really look closely, but still it sucks when these dispensaries call their product 'premium medical cannabis' and it's light dep product and hermied."

After I tried those a few months back I felt like going back to distillate was a waste of money. Lol. 

Best 60 bucks on a cart I'll ever spend and glad will again. I'm so happy to see TL is selling these. I had PW flower and was impressed by the buds size and appearance but the flavor and high were just meh for me. I typically gravitate towards indica's over anything else for these reasons alone, so I'll keep an eye out for any indicas that come their way in this form.

Question about the battery? - Does it accept 510 style carts with a screw on mag adapter? I have a PCKT and does fantastic with other rosin carts I've used and would prefer not to buy a whole new battery when I have one that can do the job.

I am gonna try posting there. Thank you!!"
FloridaTrees,fmp3vh0,t3_ftbrlq,1586273940.0,Vidacann delivery is always on point. Glad the contactless is working well. J see they're running deals this week for contactless and pre pay so I might take advantage of an order.
FloridaTrees,fmp3lfm,t3_fv2h1i,1586273784.0,"I always tip my delivery people, driving can be hella stressful dealing with traffic, etc. I always make it known it's super appreciated especially given that I live in the sticks and about 30 miles from a dispensary in any direction as we don't have any in the county I live in. I look at it the same as having food or even furniture delivered. I'm tipping them for their service, but also their time. If you can drop 300 bucks on an oz you can throw that driver a couple bucks for their time and efforts, it just seems right, and especially during this COVID period that I know that many people have had hours cut, furloughed, pay cuts, etc, I make it a priority to help out a Lil extra where I can. 10 bucks might be nothing when thinking about dropping 300, but I also know that 10 bucks could help feed someone's family, if they have a loved one out of work or whatever their situation is."
