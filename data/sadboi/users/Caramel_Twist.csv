psychology,f25cx1f,t3_dbui94,1569971423.0,"Not sure if it has been said:

This suggests that women with the ability to orgasm were more reproductively successful than women who could not.

This could suggest a Male preference for orgasming females over non orgasming females. 

And might highlight a reciprocal nature to pleasure, which may be evolutionary important for romantic/reproductive social encounters and sustained relationships. 

Female orgasms may possibly lead to more frequent sexual encounters and encourage maintaining relationships. 

This would fit with the hyper social nature of humans in contrast to many other animals.

But it’s Evo-Psych, which lacks a lot of credibility."

london,eydvcx0,t1_exf96fx,1567025214.0,"Current London Starbucks Barista here with a PSA: we arnt instructed to spell names wrong on the cups. 

Often names can be hard to spell or it is hard to hear the customer so it can be misspelt. Especially if there is a long queue of people who are quite angry and want their morning coffee. It is also the case that (speaking of London in particular) Starbucks mainly employ people from foreign countries or not native English speakers. Meaning they may be unfamiliar with spelling a large amount of names, and struggle with English to begin with.

The predominant reason we ask for names and write them on the paper cups is so that your drink does not get stolen at the end of the line. 

If we have 3 medium lattes that have been ordered and 2 large mochas all with very slight variations, calling out “Sally”, “Dennis” or “Zara” is much faster than: “Grande latte, kids temperature, 6 pumps caramel, wet!”, “Venti Mocha, No cream, Oat Milk, Extra hot!” or “Venti Coffee frap, Light ice, 7 pumps Frap Roast, Soy Milk, 2 extra shots of Blonde over the top!” 

Or in a worse case scenario, everyone orders medium lattes, and people start getting very angry that their latte has been stolen by someone who ordered the same thing and was behind them in the queue."
