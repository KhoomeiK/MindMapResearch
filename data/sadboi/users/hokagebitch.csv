Thanks for the feedback though. 

I listened to your beat man and it's kind of all over the place. There's a structure but the sounds you've chosen are all wrong. The bells need to go because it sounds like it's been sampled from church bells. I'd suggest looking up some tutorials on beat making, maybe those from Internet Money and just understanding the placements of keys to create an overall melody. You need to throw in EQs on the instruments as well as Sidechaining stuff to the kick and sidechaining those things to other elements. Just keep messing around you're gonna figure it out eventually. I'd try to start by copying drum breaks you hear on other songs or trying to recreate similar sounds. Another thing that might help is getting into sampling as it'll develop your ear more. Just gotta pick better sounds man. 

Keep working tho :)"
makinghiphop,fezr5vx,t1_fezdx31,1579460609.0,"I think the vocals are slightly too autotuned. Maybe pitch it down a bit then throw the autotune over it. Beats nice but the Synth is a little too harsh. I think the autotune is making your vocals come across as nasally maybe EQ out some of the higher frequencies and maintain vocals like 1:03, that tone's really nice. Beats nice, I'd just remove some of the distortion and pan out the mid ends, also a little more bass would be dope too.   


I think just re-record the vocals and enunciate a little more clearly and hold onto to that tone you projected at 1:03, that shit's nice.   


Other than that good stuff man just keep grinding!

makinghiphop,fdqhu73,t1_fdqfh05,1578667039.0,"I think I'd remove the beginning part and just let it go straight in. Drums are straight heat. Imma be honest man Idk if I fuck with the sharp notes you got going on with the strings. I think a chord lower, maybe a pitch down with a bit of a low pass would make it blend it better. You could also double it up, and then heighten up the lower-end and let those bass frequencies bleed in. I'd throw a spectral pan too and maybe more soft clipping to it. I think space out that sharp string basically. Maybe a love philter could do something to it. It just stands out too much and doesn't phase out as naturally as everything else in the beat. But the drums god damn good stuff man. Drums aren't easy at all. Good shit.

&#x200B;

Keep playing around man. Those drums are very nice seriously. I sense that you're just messing around and coming up with creative ways to go about the canvas. This got freshness to it, just keep working on spacing out sharp inclines with sounds like the strings.

Everything is solid technically but it's just missing variation.   


You need some variation and structure throughout the beats so the rapper's flow can adjust to it, that's what makes boom-bap really good. The technical switch-up of the flow as the beat slowly changes.   


Just need variation that's all man. Technically, it's all 10/10 but it gets stale due to it being the same looping motion over and over again. Everyone's got tiny fucking attention spans now a days unfortunately so variation is a must. Anyways man you're on the right track with this shit.

I fuck with this. I really do. The instrumental is really good, got that dance vibe to it. 

Listen around 0:18 to 0:33, you should try to keep that cause the double layering can be distracting. Also your clicks are coming in, I'd suggest re-recording but a little further away from the mic than you usually do. Tone is perfect bro. Beat is perfect. 

you just need to re-record and make sure your vocals are clean af because this instrumental is golden man. You can't give it anything but gold. Go back and re-record it, it's really good but if you do this and make sure your vox is clean, it'll do wonders. 

I love it tho, the vibe is seriously on point and the instrumental god man. that bass-line. 

Just gotta keep fixing the kinks but you're on your way. One of the rare times where I think a song will beat the recording live. I hope you get a chance to perform this live one day :) 

Keep it up and just read up on how to prevent licks/clicks from being heard, also read up on delay usage when it comes to singers. Delay is different when it comes to rap so I cant give too much advice regarding that.
