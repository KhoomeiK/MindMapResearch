Copying quirks is super OP, and kind of his signature thing with the original OFA.

It'll leave a lot of room to explore the past with Erasurehead and Present Mic.

It'll leave room for new characters to join Shigaraki and not just be an imitation of AFO's reign.

He's near as much a threat as Shigaraki to the public, given that he makes the Nomus, and potentially knows a lot about AFO, and the criminal underworld.
