AskReddit,flfz7lw,t3_foll61,1585123749.0,"In one dream I was a kid again and me and my dad were out on a cruise on his motorcycle. I forget but for some reason the bike slipped out and caused me and my dad to go flying off the bike at a decent speed. We both hit the ground at the same time but my body landed on top of my dads so I got away basically fine besides road rash and such.

&nbsp;

This is when it got really scary. I got up after the crash and ran to my dad to see if he was alright. When I got to him there was blood dripping down his face and he was making these awful gurgling/croaking sounds. I then noticed his neck was broken and it looked like he was struggling to breathe. I started panicking and I saw an elderly couple walking down the road in the distance so I tried yelling to them for help but everytime I tried yelling nothing was coming out. It felt like I was screaming with those noise canceling headsets on and caused my stress and anxiety to skyrocket. 

&nbsp;

That old couple never turned around and I kept trying to shout to them until I eventually woke up in what felt like an anxiety attack. I've had lots of creepy unexplainable dreams but this one always stood out as the scariest because of how real it felt. It was one of those dreams where it took me like half the day to recuperate after and shake that feeling of dread."
BipolarReddit,fj7gsms,t3_fby83s,1583091415.0,"It's never a bad thing to explore different options and see what works for you! I used to be a daily toker also but even though it stabilized my moods I became a very ""flat"" person if that makes any sense. Yes it alleviated my more severe depression for sure. Also it helped me settle down if I was in a more intense mood or felt agitated. But doing it every day, multiple times a day, I became almost *too* laid back where I wasn't fully ""there"" in most situations. I was basically just floating through days without a care (which I guess isn't a bad thing, just got boring). I haven't dropped weed for good though. Now I save it for when I've had a bad week or two and just get a gram on that weekend to help release. Heres to hoping for the best in your new life choices!"
suggestmeabook,fiz3irc,t3_faia2m,1582853289.0,"""The Tao Of Pooh"" is an easy read. Not exactly exciting I guess but it can be thought provoking and insightful which to me is exciting in itself. Also ""The Road"" by Cormac McCarthy is an easy read. It's about how a man and a child survive in a post apocalyptic world and it's more on the exciting/intense side of things.

&nbsp;

What I try to tell my friends to get them into reading is this. Whenever you have free time, just read one page. One page! How hard is that? One page is further into a book than if you never picked it up to begin with. And usually one page will turn into two, then maybe you'll want to see where things go and eventually you'll get rolling. Just remember, reading is supposed to be fun and interesting so don't take it too seriously (No offense non-fiction). Alot of non-readers put reading on a pedestal like it's some difficult task but we all read everyday. Just jump in and have a good time learning about and imagining new lives, new worlds, new loves, new problems, and new adventures!"
BipolarReddit,fiyxea0,t3_fak59u,1582849159.0,"I've actually realized people rarely use ""bipolar"" as a term to describe anything. Maybe it's where I live or the people I know but I havent heard anyone describe something as ""bipolar"" in a long time. I hear people say ""gay"" or ""retarded"" quite regularly though and the way I look at it is if that doesn't bug me much, why should I be bothered when someone uses the term bipolar?"
DoesAnybodyElse,fiv5uxw,t3_f9zei2,1582754360.0,"Meh, I've gotten used to it. Not only with stand-up but any type of comedy. I used to be the type that would always proclaim ""seen it/heard it/that's unoriginal"" anytime I saw or was shown something. Now I've adjusted to tolerating that some people might have never heard that joke before, seen that meme/video before, or whatever it is and let them have their laughs. Still doesn't take away the fact that whatever it is your watching is unoriginal but whatever, it is what it is. All you can hope for is that they add a new spin on the premise."
BipolarReddit,fiv2s1p,t1_fiuxbce,1582752781.0,I also don't condone or recommend using psychedelics if you have any mental illness but personally I believe it can do alot of good from my experience. I ate about half an eighth of shrooms last year and it had a huge positive impact on my mood that lasted for about a month. Sounds cliche but I felt a newfound appreciation for life and everything around me during those weeks after my trip. My analogy is that it felt like jumpstarting a battery but the battery was my brain.

bipolar,fha643d,t3_f1wc8h,1581398289.0,"I had this middle aged man as a roomie that fell asleep sitting up indian style. I found that already kind of funny but then he wet the bed while still sleeping sitting up in that position. He was kind of embarrassed about it but we both had a good laugh. He blamed it on the constipation from his meds.

&nbsp;

Also one time I was stuck in the intake portion of being admitted for almost 2 weeks (they would keep you in a small wing of the hospital that almost resembled a jail like setting till a bed opened up in the psych unit). One time they were bringing me out of that intake unit to take a shower which was located in the middle of an emergency wing. This shower was basically in what looked like a closet and had like 8 different shower heads that shot out water at a high pressure and it was amazing! Best. shower. ever. But one of the times they brought me to shower there was a plastic type stretcher in a large plastic bag and it was just COVERED in blood. It was the most blood I've ever seen in my life. It was pretty intense just staring at that stretcher with a manic state of mind and running through thoughts of how that blood got there."

WTF,ffabz2k,t1_ff9zpas,1579731946.0,"Your second paragraph hits home brotha. I've tried explaining to people sometimes half the high is just the process of going to grab and that part of being an addict is just as hard to shake as ACTUALLY using. 

One part of the process can be that text (meet me at ___ street) which is a rush in itself, then walking the grimy, dark streets with confidence and feeling like you belong there, then that feeling when you can see your runner from down the block and you're ready for that quick exchange.. I could go on about it but you already know the feels.

Sometimes I have to pass through the small cities that I used to use in and I get filled with an odd nostalgia type of feeling thinking of all the trips to grab, all those short walks, all those quick exchanges... Always have to add in all the terrible shit using caused in my life also when those thoughts arise. Addiction is crazy, man. Glad to hear you're doing better now!"
BipolarReddit,fet4roq,t3_eqih2j,1579371792.0,"Hard yes. Been there. Will probably be there again at some point.

Then comes the reality check from my friends and family.. Then I might mess around with some denial about it for a bit.. Then I'll slip right back into my depression pants. Rinse, wash, repeat."

bipolar,f9firwo,t3_e4vddo,1575273668.0,"With time comes experience, and through that experience comes knowledge. And with that knowledge you will learn how to live with yourself, manage your symptoms better, and live a more ""normal"" life. 

I had my first manic episode when I was 24 and am now turning 29 and it's a learning curve. I've had some rock bottoms but through each one I've learned more about my symptoms, built a support system of people I trust that can give me a nudge if they see something is off, and have experimented with different medications and therapy. It's a work in progress but I trust the process at this point. 

Life is never ""perfect"" or ""normal"" but as long as you're willing to put in the work and study to get better, you will be better."
bipolar,f9fh2il,t1_f9fcfio,1575271486.0,"Ahhhh, your second to last paragraph reminded me so much of a conversation I shared with a fellow admittee at my last hospital stay. We shared the same topic of questioning if bipolar disorder, or any mental illness, is really an ""illness"" just because that's how it's defined in modern society. We questioned if it could just be an elevated form of consciousness, almost like an avant-garde type situation. Not to sound all hippy-dippy.

I wish I had more wise discussion such as you wrote to bring up but I just wanted to relate and say I have entertained the same thoughts you have written. It's a very interesting take on mental illnesses, besides the whole ""mental illness bad"" mindset."

Almost all my friends have been working in the same field/career for multiple years and I'm still just bouncing around with no idea what to do, or how to do it. I'm pretty embarrassed about it and feel ashamed most the time.

what helps me feel a bit better about it is trying to understand everyone moves at their own pace. Also I try to think of it as an advantage compared to people who have been working 40+ hours a week for years. With all the free time there's alot of time for self discovery and hobbies (that dont cost money!). I mean I still feel like crap about not working about 80% of the time but reminding myself of these things eases those negative feelings just a little bit."
