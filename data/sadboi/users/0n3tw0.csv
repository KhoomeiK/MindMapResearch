schizophrenia,fll8vca,t3_fpfv85,1585255767.0,"My 2 cents is law, business, politics, and media. Understanding isn't profitable or necessarily useful.

In most cases a person who committed a crime can't defend themselves with origin theory but understanding origin may help with corrections and prevention. Hardliners seem to talk tough and ignore origin possibly inflaming a percentage of the public.

With business, politics, and media contemplating origin theory they may become hardliners as well defending their profit, employees, and business. An individual blaming their friend, lover, manager, coworker, a stranger on the internet, a political party, a product, or a movie for their mental illness may be counterproductive to their functioning and the functioning of society. Understanding origin by professionals may progress efficiency, prevention, rules, and regulations.

A person may accumulate neurotic or false perceptions consuming media or information but this can happen in reality interacting with people on a daily basis. The solution to this problem seems really complicated to understand considering the quantity of information today and accumulating into the future. A better solution is developing a strong protocol in the mind, to call out nonsense internally or externally, to think over what information you consume and what you believe without cycling through what others believe because it sounded right when you heard it.

Lastly addiction, stress, depression, or some combination of all this. I think most people can persevere on their own without needing medication or help whether through comforting harmless delusions, a routine, or strength of mind.

In my case I have discovered the truth, the truth that the United States of America does not defend their constitution, their law, or human rights or does so selectively. I have learned with certainty that the United States of America allows sensory overload, a form of torture. A type of sensory overload with no rules, regulations, or laws aided by electronic devices used by the unqualified and uneducated to force speech into an individuals senses. I have experienced more than 40,000 hours of this sensory overload which has accumulated to more than 20 million utterances forced into my senses by a few voices with their own personalities.

Aging King George III of England (Sir Nigel Hawthorne) is exhibiting signs of madness, a problem little understood in 1788. As the monarch alternates between bouts of confusion and near-violent outbursts of temper, his hapless doctors attempt the ineffectual cures of the day. Meanwhile, Queen Charlotte (Dame Helen Mirren) and Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger (Julian Wadham) attempt to prevent the King's political enemies, led by the Prince of Wales (Rupert Everett), from usurping the throne.

Jessica Lange stars in a period drama about a family moving to a military base, and she quickly becomes part of a cover-up involving nuclear bomb tests.

...

It's the early 1960s. Nuclear engineer Hank Marshall is a major in the US Army, he who works on top secret nuclear testing projects. Trouble follows him from posting to posting largely because of his mentally unstable wife, Carly Marshall, who is bipolar. During her manic phases, her already overt sexuality, which she models after such sex symbols as [Marilyn Monroe](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000054/) and [Brigitte Bardot](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000003/), is ratcheted up a notch, that partying behavior which is mixed with less frequent phases of physically destructive behavior. Regardless, Hank and Carly love each other, Hank who would admit to himself that he enjoys the fact that other men find Carly attractive, which is partly why he allows her to act the way she does in public. In turn, they mutually love their now two teenaged daughters, Alex and Becky. Reassigned from their two year posting in Hawaii largely due to the ruckus Carly has caused there, they are next sent to Alabama, the base under the command of Vince Johnson, his wife, Vera Johnson, who heads the wives' welcoming committee. At an age of starting to test her own sexuality, Alex starts to date the Johnsons' son, Glenn. Due to no fault of his own, Hank faces some problems in the latest project on which he is working, code named Blue Sky. And Carly continues her regular behavior, which catches Vince's overtly wandering eye. These items in combination lead to the potential of the Marshalls' home life being pulled apart and Hank's career destroyed, both irreparably.

**Inside Twist the Red Knob, The Weird New Cult For Men Who Don't Understand Women**

""A woman is a lock and a man is a key. If a key opens a lot of locks, it is a master key. But if one lock is opened by lots of keys, it is a dodgy lock."" -Reddittwisttheredknob

The man who uses the Internet handle ""Reddittwisttheredknob"" is having difficulty understanding women after going to a nightclub with some friends.

This may sound like the instigatory words of someone looking for a fight, sarcasm gone too far at best. But Reddittwisttheredknob shared his story in earnest with a very specific community that empathizes with his perspective.

Welcome to The Twist Red Knob, an Internet community on Reddit founded on the general belief that women have it better than men. Twist Red Knob is not a dating advice bulletin, but rather a forum for people — men, mostly — exploring an ideology that revolves almost exclusively around gender. Those who ""twist the red knob"" maintain that it's men not women, who have been socially disenfranchised. Feminism is considered a damaging ideology and Twist Red Knobers are quick to cite examples that bolster their points, some going so far as to argue that society is outright anti-male. Twist Red Knob followers have their own politics, language, and culture. And they're growing: Eight months ago, Twist Red Knob had only 100 followers. Today, it has more than 15,000.

**What is Twist Red Knob all about?**

The Twist Red Knob is a collection of ideas encompassed by what its subscribers refer to as the ""manosphere,"" a number of loosely-associated blogs that focus on masculinity and personal philosophy for men.

The community's name is a tip of the hat to the truth-seeking attitude in The Matrix – Keanu Reeves twists the red knob to unplug his mind from a simulated world, freeing him to explore genuine reality.

For Twist Red Knobers, genuine reality goes something like this: Female oppression is a myth and men are the ones holding the short end of the stick.

Twist Red Knob pays a lot of attention to that last part about sex – conversations on the forum are often about one's strategies for attracting mates, but there's a present (if slightly lesser) focus on self-improvement as well.

**The common criticisms**

There seems to be an inherent contradiction at the heart of this community – it's an overwhelmingly male population advocating unpopular opinions on females, but it is almost entirely focused on attracting and seducing as many of them as possible. (There is a subset of Twist Red Knobers that want nothing to do with women called ""MGTOW."" More on them to come.)

While there is absolutely an active, vocal female contingent to this group, its corresponding forum, Twist Red Knob Women, is just shy of 1,500 subscribed members, a fraction of Twist Red Knob's 15,000-plus.

For a group whose ideology presents itself as a straightforward means of self-improvement and sociological liberation, Twist Red Knob often muddies the water with highly-charged polemics on the proper way for men and women to relate to each other.

If this sounds like a disingenuous way to meet people, some Twist Red Knobers see it as no worse than a woman wearing makeup.

It needs to be clear that there's a spectrum to Twist Red Knob attitude, as there is with any ideology. 

A lot of people view this as malevolent sexism, but Twist Red Knob's pseudonymous forum moderator Morpheus, champion of the Twist Red Knob movement, told us that ""we hold the principle of equal opportunity in high regard; it’s the desire for equal outcome that we disagree with – something that we strongly feel feminism pushes for.""

**Where did Twist Red Knob come from?**

This post lays out a point-by-point explanation of why Twist Red Knob exists. Twist Red Knobers don't want to isolate themselves from women per se, they want to ""understand \[them\], have sex, and understand why 'game' works in our society and discuss its ramifications.""

A 2010 blog post called ""The Misandry Bubble"" functions as a Twist Red Knob manifesto of sorts, and lays out an involved but accessible overview of ideas.

Twist Red Knob thought extrapolates this to the extreme. 

So Twist Red Knobers' ideas and actions come from a place of resisting what they find to be a generally oppressive society. This forum was born as a place to share game tactics, Twist Red Knob theory, and to just blow off steam with like-minded folks.

**Why does someone Twist The Red Knob?**

**The lingo**

There's a shorthand for referring to many common concepts inside Twist Red Knob thought.

One Twist Red Knober describes what it's like to see his friend's wife ""hit the wall.""

This is a school of thought similar to Twist Red Knob that's all about being a man who ""will not surrender \[his\] will to the social expectations of women and society, because both have become hostile against masculinity.""

**What does Twist Red Knob do?**

Community members dissect Twist Red Knob theory with each other, sharing ""field reports"" of their experiences, writing ""rants"" against feminism or other topics.

By Morpheus's own admission, Twist Red Knob doesn't do much offline.

**Misandry and male disadvantage**

This video gets at the general tone of the Twist Red Knob worldview.

**The other side of the coin?**

A prominent feminist blogger who we'll call Alicia described Twist Red Knob to us as follows: ""Where feminists are saying, 'Okay men, you have enough rights. Let women catch up,' Twist Red Knob says, 'Hey women, you have too many rights and we need to take some away.'""

She says that Twist Red Knob isn't actually the other side of the gender relations coin, but a group of hateful, militant extremists. Twist Red Knob is quick to respond with data that purport to show an institutional bias against males, such as the stat that ""90% of imprisonments, suicides, and crippling occupational injuries are of men,"" but Alicia calls this a ""shroud of credibility.

When we asked Morpheus if Twist Red Knobers hate women, he said, ""Delving into Twist Red Knob ideas is a very shocking experience for some, especially for those who were raised to believe that politically correct ideals reflect nature.""

Alicia said. ""When you're 15, girls are weird and you're looking for answers. The Twist Red Knob claims to have them.""

**Becoming alpha**

The stated goal of a man in The Twist Red Knob community, generally speaking, is to ""become alpha.""

Perhaps unsurprisingly, he hadn't exactly Twisted The Red Knob.

Obviously, there's nothing wrong with motivating guys to become better men, but The Twist Red Knob seems to be doing so in an aggressive and adversarial sort of way.

Romaniello referenced a post he saw where a Twist Red Knober wrote something to the effect of ""if you focus on self-improvement, you'll attract a higher-quality woman.""

I think there are many Twist Red Knob members who see it that way.

It seems like The Twist Red Knob is generally taking the idea of alpha from the pickup artist perspective and running in an extreme direction with it.

I think that's likely the reason The Twist Red Knob has gotten the reputation of being misogynistic.

Romaniello added, ""I want to like the Twist Red Knob. They're helping guys find confidence and actively seek self-edification.

Maybe the Twist Red Knobers just have a bit more growing to do. I think they'll get there.

**But does it work?**

We were interested to see if we could find an example of someone struggling with Twist Red Knob and everything that goes along with it."
