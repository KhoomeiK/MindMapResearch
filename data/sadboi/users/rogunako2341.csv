FFBraveExvius,fmdqxuv,t1_fla08dh,1585975243.0,"Me too. I am soldiering on because it somehow reminds me of FFT. I am already at rank 35 in the game and I find the storyline subpar compared to FFT. Also, For free-to-play players, it will be an arduous grindfest and the gap between them and PTW is huge."
FFBraveExvius,fmdqmzr,t1_fl9wzxj,1585974989.0,"Thanks! I can relate to your feedback. I got annoyed with Ramada as well. WOTVFFBE should've added a skip tutorial option. Also, the menu is so unintuitive and annoying so I have to click multiple times to get where  I want to go. GL also becoming slow and crashing multiple times now. Devs are trying to fix issues and make it faster and appreciate when they give rewards for maintenance."

nosleep,epo1wdo,t3_bls5lo,1559337036.0,"Addiction promises to fill that void in your life with 'false sense of happiness' and fleeting moments of enjoyment. 

In reality, Addiction is ruthless: it is a monster; it lives inside, and feeds off of you, takes from you, controls you, and destroys you. It is a beast that tears you apart, rips out your soul, and laughs at your weakness. It is a stone wall that stands to keep you in and the rest out. It is a shadow that always lurks behind you, waiting to strike. Addiction lives in everyone‚Äôs mind, sitting, staring, waiting..

Please stay in touch with your sister. If she's showing any signs of addiction. Be there for her especially during difficult times. The opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection."
