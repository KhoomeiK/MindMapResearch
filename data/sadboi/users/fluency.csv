We both know what we wrote. You know I haven’t gone on any tangents about your spelling or grammar, you’ve read all my posts. And I’ve read all of yours. You’re flailing, man, your logic is starting to unravel and I suspect you know it.

You’re trying to use language to manupilate and obscure whats actually going on, but thats not happening.

You started off by glorifying «warrior culture» and all that nonsense, in a post which got pretty heavily downvoted I might add, and when people called you out on it you got defensive and started using pretty harsh language. Which you’re still doing, by the way. You know what that tells me, besides the fact that you are getting angry? It tells me you know you are going to lose any argument in which someone points out what a flawed world view those statements represent.  
You are also starting to assume some pretty huge things about the people calling you out. This most recent point is an excellent example of that, where you again mount the barricades ranting and raving about hillbillies and uneducated half-wits. You seem to be rather proud of your education and intellect, which I’m guessing is a sore spot for you. Anyone who dares to disagree with you or talk back at you must be unintelligent and uneducated, right? That is the only possible explanation for why someone could possibly disagree with you. Right?

Blow it out your arse.

Edit: About the downvotes though! Your initial comment in this thread is sitting at negative 30 right now, with the next most downvoted in this chain at negative 6. Both of those are collapsed automatically because of the amount of downvotes. That means that the vast majority of people reading the comments will never bother to read any of this. So while that initial comment, the one that sparked all this, will likely continue to sink slightly, the comments we post at this point will most probably not recieve many votes, up or down.  
You might argue that upvotes and downvotes are a poor metric for judging the contents of a post, and you would be right, but it is an indicator of how popular a particular comment is, and how many people agree or disagree with it. And lets just say that your opinion isn’t particularly highly regarded. Make of that what you will."
