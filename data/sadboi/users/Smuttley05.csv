ESOCribs,fp5jjc2,t3_gb9t8r,1588331650.0,"I love this house, it’s a lot of fun to furnish. As someone mentioned above, furniture recipes are great if you have a crafter or the mats. It may be better to simply buy furniture from the guild stores instead of crafting if you just want one piece or lack materials.

Crown store should be your last point of call for furnishing, it can really add up and a lot of the stuff you can buy for gold in the guild stores so don’t waste your irl money if you can help it. 

Something overlooked - achievement furnishers. There’s one in each zone, do the quests and get achievements in the zones, and you can unlock the ability to buy some cool stuff! Next to every achievement furnisher is a general goods furnisher, they sell things like plants/trees, rocks, these are awesome because plants and trees are very important to making a house look alive. I personally furnished my psijic villa by placing lots of trees around the sides. 

Another great place - the luxury furnishing vendor, this is my favourite source of furnishing by far. Every weekend they sell something different, it’s always worth checking out. 

A good guide to furniture is a website called the lovely north I think? Check it out, has guides to all the achievement furnishers, what they have on offer and the general furnishers as well."

elderscrollsonline,f8jgjm2,t3_e0uptf,1574599899.0,"Just another something I would like to add - this build suggests you use purifying light. I would disregard that and instead opt for Power of the Light. It’s a stamina ability, yes, but it places a powerful debuff on the target which is essential for Templar healers to use. 
To add onto that, a set that’s great to use with a Templar healer is Martial knowledge, use it instead of jorvulds. This set places a debuff on the enemy that increases their damage taken by 5% for a few seconds at a time. To activate this debuff, you need to light attack the target when your stamina is below 50% - which, if you have a good uptime of power of the light, you should have no issues maintaining. If you have too much stam you can always do a roll dodge or something. 

A good healer doesn’t just keep the group alive, but they also buff their group’s dps. This can be achieved by being vigilant of your buff uptimes such as ele drain, power of the light and also martial knowledge, IA or any other proc set you may be using.
An effective healer can make all the difference to the group. I see so many Templar healers not using power of the light and it’s honestly just incomprehensible to me. Such a strong ability, so often neglected.

Happy healing ^^"
AskReddit,f8jayzy,t3_e0t3c0,1574598023.0,"Obligatory not an employee but a customer.

Visited build-a-bear for the first time at the age of 24 and was far too excited and also too old for it I suppose, but as you’re about to find out, my level of maturity wasn’t that high.

Had no idea that was an option. 
Said all I had to do was say my chosen phrase into this little microphone and the machine stressed you didn’t even have to do it loudly because it’s a special microphone so I decided I wanted my bear to say “fuck” but like how the dog says it in [this](https://youtu.be/T5ljF6XgTww) video. I felt safe because the shop was loud and the children in the line behind me wouldn’t hear me say it, right? Right?!

skyrim,f89wiid,t3_dzshxp,1574381656.0,"Those particular packs I haven’t played with yet, however I would say some are good and some are bad.

However, the wild horses mod for example, I thought was pretty rubbish. They aren’t too pricey and can add a fun little twist to the game if you’d like to still be able to earn trophies(idk if you can earn trophies with mods on pc as I play on console, creation club mods allow you to still earn trophies as they aren’t cheats, more cosmetic/added content)."

skyrim,f6payg9,t3_dsf8rc,1573052110.0,"What’s on your screen is like you’re playing a character in either first or third person. The world is open like a sandbox game, so while you have quest markers and missions and stuff, you aren’t on a timer to do those missions, parts of the world won’t be blocked off to you if you don’t do those missions(apart from like say, a certain dungeon or cave or building tied to a particular mission, but let’s say that covers maybe 10/15% of what you can explore). Try to google some images to get a rough idea of the landscape. Basically there are plains, there are forested areas and snowy areas.

You are able to fully interact with the world. You see a deer? You can kill it for meat and fur. You see a barrel? You can look inside and take from it. You kill someone? You can take all their armour, their weapons, everything in their inventory. Same for pickpocketing them(though you need the highest skill to be able to take things off them that are equipped). Every building you can go into(apart from the few locked due to ties with quests as mentioned above). You can pick locks to get into chests and buildings that have restricted access(not places locked due to being tied to a quest will not be accessible even by picking the lock until you do a quest). 

You can choose what order you finish your quests in. You can leave the main story till last if you like, there’s plenty to do in between. Perhaps go clear a cave of bandits, or recover a lost weapon for a civilian in some ancient ruins. On your adventures you can collect loot and sell it to merchants later to make gold. You can spend your gold on weapons armour, houses, horses. 
You can of course loot awesome weapons and armour on your adventures. 
You can assist a Daedric prince which is essentially a demon, and earn their relic which could be a weapon or armour that is powerful and useful. 

You have skill trees for all sorts of things such as crafting, enchanting, destruction magic, archery, light armour etc etc. When you utilise these skills they level up, and when enough skills level up your character gains a level and you’re given a skill point to spend on a perk in one of your skill trees which makes you more powerful in that skill. There’s no level cap so theoretically you can unlock all the perks for everything eventually if you really want. 

As for combat, it can be as simple or complicated as you like. Set the difficulty real low if you’re more into the story and want to be powerful and one shot everything. Set the difficulty higher and you’ll have to do stuff like enchant your weapon to give it a magical ability to be stronger, or improve it with your crafting skill. Or make poisons and potions to make you stronger or your enemy weaker. Say you start in heavy armour with a sword and shield, but half way though you decide you’d like to try sneaking in light armour with a dagger. Nothing is stopping you from doing that. 

So when people say you can do anything you want in Skyrim, they mean that if you’re riding on your horse to complete a quest and go by an interesting cave, you can go in the cave and explore it first. Or you can walk around picking ingredients for alchemy to make potions. Or you can sneak up on people and steal their valuables, or break into their homes. Or you can go to a known area where a dragon is and slay it. They basically mean the world is fully at your disposal. 

Of course my explanation won’t cover everything, I recommend watching maybe some gameplay of Skyrim on YouTube to get a better understanding if you’re still apprehensive. But if you enjoy open world games, I would say give it a try."

You can decorate a house with your trophies in eso. You get plaques with the boss’s head for completing normal difficulty content and golden busts for completing veteran level content. It’s awesome to display those trophies in your home. 

Myself personally, I first got my house because I enjoyed the idea of decorating it. Then I went on to acquire all basic crafting stations so that I could travel to my house for free from anywhere to save myself going into a town centre to deconstruct/refine. I have the merchant and banker so I stick them in there as well for convenience.

elderscrollsonline,f69fmcu,t3_dqs8ou,1572741241.0,"Wormcult from vaults of madness basically reduces the cost of spells for you and your group. As a starter set, it works well as you’ll have really good sustain which will make getting used to the role a little easier. Another has mentioned sanctuary. This is another nice starter dungeon set as it will increase the strength of your heals. 

As for using a sorc to heal... if you are doing normal dungeons, or even a few vets, there’s nothing wrong with using it. 
However, I would suggest going with either a Templar or warden healer. Usually people start with the Templar as the warden as a lot of buffs to keep up, making it a bit trickier, but don’t let that put you off if you’d like to make a warden. It’s all about practice. 

The reason why a Templar or warden healer is best is because both classes have a nice aoe HoT(heal over time), and skill that buffs the overall damage of both stam and mag(sorcs can only buff the magicka dds).

People say play what you want, and I don’t disagree with that sentiment. Yet at the same time, warden and Templar just has more at their disposal with regards to healing."

I sell crowns and buy them myself and I will never, ever send the crowns first. Never. Nor would I expect someone to send crowns to me first. There are more people out there interesting in buying crowns than there are people selling them. I wouldn’t waste my time with someone asking me to send the crowns first unless I have traded with them before. 

I would be far more worried about losing actual irl money to a scammer than ingame money too. 

I mean hey, you’re welcome to ask them to send the crowns first, but that isn’t likely to go down well."
elderscrollsonline,f5ozssy,t3_dofk2h,1572341744.0,"So a good idea is to go through a guild, as guild members tend to be more trustworthy.

But let’s say for example you’re buying in zone chat, as that’s more risky. 

Go in zone chat, say “wtb 5k crowns(or however much you want)”. If a person whispers you and says they will trade with you, send them a group invite. If they accept, then so far so good. 

Then, ask in chat if it’s okay to travel somewhere so you could meet and do the trade in person, a good suggestion is to ask them to travel to their house and you meet them there. If they don’t want to meet “in person” or are trying to rush you into trading, this is a red flag. Do not trade with them. 

If their house is done nicely, then it’s a good indication that they’ve put time into their account and wouldn’t want to risk it. If it’s not decorated, still it’s not necessarily a red flag. But it’s good to be in the house so you can be somewhere that the chat between you isn’t polluted by zone chat. 

Next step is to speak in chat(not on mic!) and agree upon the amount of crowns for gold exchange, what it is you want from the crown store, etc. This is so you and ZoS have a record of the agreement to trade and you can take screencaps as evidence if things go wrong. 
Another good tip is to slip into this chat that you’ve been scammed before and want a record of communication for ~both of you~ to have security that you can have action taken, and that in the past you managed to get your gold. If this person is a scammer, they will be concerned by this. If this person is legit, they will appreciate that you are taking steps to protect both of your interests. Even if you’ve never traded before, it’s okay to say that you have. 

If you feel comfortable that you have sufficient evidence should things go wrong, and you’re happy with the other person, it’s time to trade. Usually the person buying the crowns will exchange the gold first, and this is the preferred etiquette seeing as ingame currency < real money. You trade the gold to them first and then they will send you the item(s). 

Hope this helps!"

elderscrollsonline,f5oz2qa,t3_doibjq,1572340536.0,"On a warden healer, it’s best to have lots of sets at your disposal but if you’re going for a “catch all” healing build that suits normal/vet dungeons, I would suggest you go for olorime and sanctuary. Olo gives a nice damage buff to the group, sanctuary will buff the amount of healing you can do for your group. The monster set you’ll want to run is bodgans. 

As for a build, this is my basic set up for dungeons:

Front bar(resto):
Combat prayer, blue Betty, radiating regeneration, illustrious, energy orb. Ulti enchanted forest.

Back bar(destro):
Enchanted growth, expansive frost cloak, budding seeds, fetcher infection, elemental drain. Ulti warhorn

If I’m in a situation where I have no magicka dds, I will use the masters resto staff and swap elemental drain for overflowing alter. 

Again, this is a very basic set up which should work nicely for all dungeons. A trial set up will be a little different, and depending on the trial, I’ll use different sets and abilities.

As for champion points, I suggest using google to search for alcast’s warden healer build, as that’s the champion points I use.

If you’d like to do damage and heal, the set Zen’s redress is very nice, though I don’t use it myself but look for builds that incorporate that set, it’s a good place to start.

A little tip: the mushrooms spell is great for a self heal, it’s in the green balance line and I believe the first spell you can unlock. 

For sustain and higher damage, in the animal companions skill line is the Betty netch. Once you’ve levelled that line up, I suggest getting that, it lasts for around 20 seconds and gives back magicka. When you morph it(which means once you’ve levelled the skill you have a choice to turn it into one of two abilities, in case you weren’t aware of this), it will give you higher damage as well as magicka back so long as you have it activated. Also it looks really cool.

elderscrollsonline,f5opwuo,t3_dol0z2,1572326371.0,"Firstly, you can’t use them until you attune them. To attune the crafting stations, I believe you slot the station in your quickslot, then go to your desired set location. Let’s say you want to make a clothing table for hundings rage. You slot your attunable clothing station and “use it”(like how you would use a potion for example) whilst standing in front of the hundings rage clothing station. 

You don’t have to wait, they won’t scale to your level. In my honest opinion, it doesn’t really matter what set you attune them into, because you probably won’t be crafting sets very often or any time soon as a new player. You need to research a certain amount of traits to even be able to craft in the first place. You’ll probably need the help of someone who can craft sets if you ever need them.

I wouldn’t say crafting sets is so important and vital to this game. It’s handy to research traits, to have the ability to craft sets yourself etc, but you won’t need it that often unless you do writs. 

And when you do need to craft stuff for yourself to use, you’ll most likely have access to a guild house that has all the attunables available or it won’t be that much of a big deal to just fast travel to the place to craft it. Again, if you do writs it’s just easier to be in a guild that has access to all stations. 

What these stations are most useful for at a low level is the ability to place them in your home and fast travel there for free when you want to deconstruct or research pieces. Sometimes you have to get to a wayshrine, navigate a city to get to the crafting stations to decon, research and refine. It’s so convenient to just be able to head to your house to do these things. 

When I attuned my stations, I just chose them all to be julianos because I felt lazy, and I usually play magicka characters so it’s easy to make training gear for them with my stations. It doesn’t really add much convenience to my eso life with regards to crafting sets, but I always keep them in my bank. See, I already had all basic crafting stations in my house for the reason I mentioned above, which is saving myself from travelling to a city to do my deconning, research and refining. However, I am a huge housing fanatic and I’m constantly crafting furniture for my new houses, so I find these stations useful to just have the ability to carry around and put out for use of crafting furnishings, rather than travelling back and forth from my main house or dismantling the crafting areas."

elderscrollsonline,f5msfph,t3_docthn,1572293160.0,"I wouldn’t say too difficult. Actually wardens are pretty simple if you’re going for dps. They can be a little more challenging if you want to heal or tank with it, but those challenging aspects will only apply to vet content which you won’t be ready for just yet if you’re only starting out. 

I adore my magicka warden who I use for questing. They are a lot of fun to play and I just really enjoy the visuals and feel of the class. 

If you want to “min-max” which means to get the most out of whatever role you wish to play, I’ll suggest the following:

For stamina damage dealing warden, you could go reguard which will make it easier to sustain, or orc which will give you the most damage.

For a magicka damage dealing warden, the Breton is better for sustain and high elf will give the most damage.

For a warden healer, I would suggest a Breton for the sustain, high elf for stronger heals. 

If you’d like to play a tank, you could go for a Nord which I believe gives a lot of resistances, or argonian which has some very helpful and complimentary passives, such as every potion you drink is a tri stat potion. I don’t know much about tanking as I don’t have a tank myself so I apologise if the extra info provided for this bit isn’t accurate, and hope that someone could correct me if I’m wrong or have missed something.

My suggestion would be to go for a choice that gives sustain, it may be better to not be running out of your resources constantly when you haven’t quite yet learnt how to manage that without the help of sustain racial passives. But that’s my own personal opinion, and if you don’t decide to choose any of the races I’ve listed, it won’t break your game or make it difficult. You can honestly play whatever you like the most.
Min maxing only really matters for a small percentage of players who push for scores in veteran trials. 
Whatever race feels right to you, or fits the idea of who you want to be in eso in your head, you go for that and enjoy this wonderful game 😁"

I spent hours completing the stonefalls quest to get into riften because I played so much Skyrim and was excited to see what it was like. Lol

I wish I knew you could zoom your camera all the way out in third person which makes it easier to avoid aoes and just play the game. I played in first person for months, and then third person but super zoomed in for more months lol"

I remember being at a friend’s house and I broke a glass. I immediately started crying and freaking out, thinking they were going to lose their shit at me. They just laughed about the broken glass and helped me clean up the pieces. That was fucking wild to me. 

I’m an adult now and I haven’t spoken to any of my family in 7 years. Feels good man."
