Enneagram,ey3tyws,t3_cveisv,1566773641.0,"I have been guilty of this myself. It's heavily related to holy love in my opinion. 9s want to see the best in everyone because they believe everything is worth loving- except themselves. When someone seems to return this 'love' (or acceptance, you could say) 9s can become infatuated with all the positives attributes this person posses in their eyes. 9s have a believer/skeptic dychotomy. This can translate to people as well. In my own life I've had relationships where I only saw the good attributes of the person and disregarded all bad parts of them. It's through this mechanism that we maintain our sense of peace, the poor replica of holy love. In most of these relationships the other person does something unexpected for me- breaking this illusion, and in many cases it's hurt me terribly (most of these cases involved betrayal of trust and such- terrible thing for 9s). I do think there's a healthy way for this disruption to happen: by showing your bad sides organically. Don't betray their trust, or be mean on purpose. Come clean and show them your bad side. They may get a whiplash at first, but they (hopefully) will come around, if they're healthy enough."

Enneagram,ey03fo0,t3_cuxdmb,1566673871.0,I'm cancer. The type is described as very 6-2-9 ish. But in general terms the basic description does kinda fit me. Except the whole nurturing mother archetype. Not at all me.
mentalhealth,exzvrvq,t1_exzrp37,1566671259.0,"I'm glad you went to the session. You know, I get how we are socially pressured to hide our pain. Mayhaps your living arrangements make this a difficult task- to process and express your pain. What's true is that you don't have to put on a façade. You are allowed to express your pain. Hiding it will not help healing at all. I hope that you put yourself first in this situation. Hopefully your friends will understand. And if they don't, reconsider their stance in your life. I know it can be complicated in friendships but please consider these words. Take care."
Enneagram,exznxc3,t1_exrhs5t,1566668829.0,"You know, you're right. Stuff that diminishes my (already extremely scarce) value as a 9 gets under my skin because it's my biggest sore spot. Stuff like insignificant or worthless get to me really bad. I'm used to labels such as pushover, tasteless, innocous so they don't hurt me. In fact I agree with those. But the former two? Fuck no. That hurts."
unpopularopinion,exz3qmg,t3_cuq4yb,1566660579.0,I agree. I sit like that too. Men have more valid reasons for it (their package takes space) but those who over do it in public transportation should be mindful of how they can squish other people. Men or women. I've seen both sit that way. Doesn't matter. Just don't invade my personal space.
mentalhealth,exycxoo,t3_cuqq31,1566650539.0,Hi sweetie. I'm sorry you've had such a terrible experience happen to you. This has been traumatic for you. To avoid any further complications I suggest you go to a therapist to process the event properly and heal from it. Was there a trigger to his behaviour? Seems very drastic to me. Your life was threatened in this situation and you are still in high alert. Take your time to heal. It'll soon be okay. You can DM if you want to vent or anything as well.

Enneagram,exuzgkm,t1_exukb5c,1566590313.0,Korean couples do it all the time for some reason. So much so that if they see celebrities wearing the same clothes they assume they're dating.
AskReddit,exuokzq,t3_cuctl4,1566586388.0,Sounds accurate because I failed all my subjects that year. Specially math. I still don't know how to get good grades so I'll probably fail again.
GenderCritical,extvc77,t3_cu38uz,1566575326.0,"My country contains a part of the Amazon as well and this just makes me extremely sad in so many levels. As in, not only because of the huge loss this is -the natural resources, the oxygen, the thousands of species to be lost- but also for the natives in the are, which have been fucked over for hudreds of years by greediness. It makes deeply, deeply sad. We always get nutcases as presidents in South America. We have the worst fucking luck."

Hashimotos,exlev58,t1_exlcrty,1566411673.0,"I was never diagnosed with Hashimoto's so no idea, but my mom had hyperthyroidism when young. Mayhaps she had some deficiency when pregnant as well. Genes are probably at fault."
Hashimotos,exlc1ys,t3_cthmse,1566410097.0,"I was diagnosed hypo at 13, had the symptoms since two years prior to that, and by age 15 my metabolism was rather normalized and my current TSH seems normal. I may still have low T3 or T4, but in general I'd say my thyroid is working decently. There may be some truth to the article. I went through intense hunger (famine) during the years my hypo symptoms went away and I think it influences it. Nowadays I still have brain fog, fatigue, dry nails and thin hair so that's why I think I may be subclinical at this point but my metabolism is working well now."
