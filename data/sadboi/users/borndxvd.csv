mentalhealth,fpume78,t3_gfm2vh,1588916845.0,"We are extremely proud of you! Keep it up; let‚Äôs make it 3 months, 4 months, 5 months. I know it can be so hard but if you can make it this far, the only way is up! Stay safe and keep your head up!"
mentalhealth,fpuma7k,t3_gfn7ez,1588916754.0,"Hey man, you have people here for you. Mental illness strips everyone of their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life but there can be a brighter side. I know how it seems like it will never get better but there is so many options for treatment? Do you go to therapy or open up to friends? I know as a guy we don‚Äôt open up much and that eats us alive but maybe try and see if a close friend would let you vent. There‚Äôs been a connection of suppressing your feelings to a pressure cooker, there‚Äôs only so much we can take before we explode. Try to journal or just make some notes in your phone. Try to express your feelings even if it‚Äôs just fragments or small phrases. You are never alone and there are people who love you and want the best for you. Keep your head up man, you can do it!"
mentalhealth,fpfcnl3,t3_gd500k,1588567420.0,"I personally am not a fan of medication but that‚Äôs just my personal experience. Often times they treat people with both medication and therapy rather than just one. I used to take Zoloft and it made me feel like I was more empty than I already felt. I struggled connecting with people because these meds made me feel nothing rather than everything at once. I then tried Zoloft with Abilify after I was in a psychiatric hospital and that had the same effect. 2 years later, I tried Seroquel and it had the same effect. It‚Äôs kind of a trial and error ordeal so it could take dozens of meds to find one that helps. I‚Äôm 20 years old and I don‚Äôt want to rely on medication for the rest of my life. I‚Äôm trying to be better about other alternatives and hopefully therapy again soon once COVID-19 calms down. It‚Äôs purely your choice but psychologists/psychiatrists will likely recommend both. CBT or cognitive behavioral therapy is something that I think you could benefit from. I went to therapy for major depression and generalized anxiety disorder and I felt a little more at peace with myself. Maybe talk to your prescriber about trying something new or therapy programs? I wish you well with this! You can do it!"

mentalhealth,fpe1hgq,t3_gctqp5,1588538481.0,"You should never feel terrible about having a mental illness, it is completely out of your control ok? There are dozens of factors that come together to form how we are. I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety my senior year of high school and it‚Äôs been nothing but a battle. I COMPLETELY understand what you mean by scaring people with what you say, I keep how I feel to myself because I have had dark thoughts. I wish mental illness wasn‚Äôt so stigmatized today,  people are suffering and just want someone to listen. I hate when people think just because someone has a mental illness, they‚Äôre psychotic. Some illnesses yes but not all, people have to stop generalizing everything. Be proud of opening up a little, that‚Äôs hard to do as is!"
mentalhealth,fpddcdr,t3_gctqp5,1588524758.0,"A pandemic shouldn‚Äôt mean we turn a blind eye to those we care about! Of course everyone‚Äôs physical health is important during this but mental health is right up there too. It‚Äôs important and I know it‚Äôs cliche but you‚Äôre loved. People care about you and I think they would much rather prefer you to speak the truth then lie. I feel what you mean about hating yourself because i have my days too but remember there‚Äôs only one of you. There will only ever be one of you so try try try to love yourself! You took the initiative with the program which is a great start, things will come together help you feel so much better about yourself and life. Keep your head up and stay healthy, you got this!"
mentalillness,fpd77a2,t3_gcq4pt,1588521257.0,"Hey man, I am very sorry to hear about your struggle with schizophrenia and I commend you on wanting to serve despite this struggle. A relative of mine suffers from paranoid schizophrenia so I am totally aware of the condition. I also am currently studying psychology with hopes to be a clinical psychologist. If there‚Äôs anything I recommend for the high intensity stress moments, it‚Äôs grounding exercises. They‚Äôll feel as if things slow down a little and you can breathe freely. A quick Google search can give you dozens of options to try. Hopefully, they might be of some benefit and I wish you the best. Keep your head up and stay strong!"
mentalillness,fpc2ux8,t3_gcjq98,1588485839.0,"I know exactly what you mean, I have struggled with suicidal ideation for about 5-6 years and it hasn‚Äôt really gotten better. To make things worse is that I am a psychology major and I can‚Äôt even figure out how to stop this way of thinking. It‚Äôs like no matter how much you try to think about something positive, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the negative thoughts flow back into your mind. You‚Äôre definitely not alone in this and I‚Äôm glad you are still here with us. Keep your head up, you got this."
