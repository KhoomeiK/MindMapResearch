Norse Paganism, even in its prime, was borrowed from the Germanic tribal societies, historically recorded in the hundreds, probably each with their own minor variations of the religion.

occult,fn6ypa5,t3_fzzjg2,1586709938.0,"The origin of the virus goes as far back as ... Well, bats in caves in China and around the world. And sometimes other animals. Not all of the viruses in the coronavirus family can be transmitted across species.

COVID-19 shares many of the same protein-attacking characteristics as SARS, with some striking similarities with HIV and Ebola. The virology lab in Wuhan specialized in coronavirus, and a virologist named Shi Zhengli even published academic articles in The Lancet about her research trying to manipulate a coronavirus to be able to transfer from one species to another. It was her specialty.

The Wuhan meat market was probably used as a coverup ; they blamed the animals (bats in this case). Whether it was negligence from the employees at the lab, or whether it was intentional by the Chinese Communist Party, that's unknown. I'd like to assume that the CCP had a contingency plan or two. The Wuhan market narrative stuck, people bought it, and it took the possibility of the other two possibilities being a possibility out of the media spotlight.

Do I personally think this was China's first attempt at the weaponization of a virus? I do. Will it ever be proven? Probably not. China is good at covering its tracks. Considering the eerie similarities with SARS, it's likely they got the idea when the SARS scare came around. SARS only infected around a thousand people though if I remember correctly. The numbers were very low. COVID-19 did much, much better.

The Chinese military knows it's at a disadvantage. The virus doesn't even have to be an extremely effective killer, it just has to be effective enough that without medical attention, the infected person has a high chance of mortality and is incapacitated. --- What's high enough, or considered high, I don't know. --- Commies then take out our hospitals and medical facilities if it's possible, or the pandemic infects enough people that hospitals are overwhelmed and rendered useless. It cripples our military soon after (*check out that aircraft carrier, eh? It worked. The captain better be reinstated, but that's a rant in itself.*), and the Chinese military comes crashing down on us during the height of the pandemic. --- It's the perfect weapon. Of course, then there's some American in an underground bunker with the key for the big missiles that go Boom. --- So, who fires first?

If the virologists in Wuhan actually accomplished what Zhengli was trying to do, then we're in trouble. In that case, they just infect control groups in hopes for a mutation. We cannot bioengineer a virus, but they can be ""Farmed"" for a mutation. Once they get a mutation, they infect a new control group (animal or human) with the new mutation and keep doing the same process on the original strain and every subsequent mutation after the fact. The goal would be to find which strain is the most effective killer, store it, and wait for the right time to release it.

This was just a test run, IMO. The CCP doesn't give two shits about the Chinese people. If China loses a few million on a test run to see how effective the weapon is, fuck it. They don't care about human rights."

occult,fn65fu7,t3_fzt4r1,1586688147.0,"I love how many modern people try to find some kind of supernatural knowledge from a culture that frequently swapped Gods for other Gods, or like you said in the case of Aten, tried to do away with the other Gods altogether. This is basically the story of Egypt's religious history.

A culture that practiced religious sacrifice of both animals and humans, kept slaves (who didn't back then though, right?), and was ruled by a monarchy? These people really had some kind of religious truth, you think? Always sounded like a bunch of bullshit to me.

There are similarities between polytheistic deities across many cultures. However, look how Christianity spread like a virus across Europe throughout the Middle Ages. Why are ancient polytheistic religions any different? Are they? The similarities found between civilizations that had no contact with one another are for debate and have been up for study for a very long time, which holds interest for both archaeology and psychology. This still does not mean that any of these people held any real religious or occult ""truth."" It's more a testament to the psychological and biological programming of the human mind. There's definitely some truth to be found there."

When someone asks you for advice, it's usually considered a common courtesy to state what you're saying is an opinion.
