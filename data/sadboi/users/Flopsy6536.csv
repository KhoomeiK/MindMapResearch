BreakUp,fq069zm,t1_fpzmf9q,1589028084.0,This is good advice! Chasing someone who doesn’t want you is an absolute no no. And it can take you down a much shittier path. Totally agree with what you said about confidence as well. It’s good to make clear how you feel but then move on with your self respect in tact.
BreakUp,fq05y6s,t1_fpz9h7w,1589027981.0,"Glad it helped and sorry for the typos I was still half asleep, but I felt compelled to respond because your story sounded similar to mine. I live in London too btw! 

So when my break up happened we had just got back from holiday and my reaction was to ask him to leave, which he did. I went to stay at my parents and never slept in our bed again. I just never went back to the flat apart from to clear it out. I cleared his stuff too - I was so adamant that seeing him again would set me back that I asked a friend and my dad to help and we cleared it all and too it to his parents where he was staying. I gave them a hug and wished them well and that was it.

I don’t think I’m a particularly strong person and I cried and talked about him and what happened over and over for at least 5 or 6 months. Even now when the subject comes up I will mention him and I do feel deep down there is a sadness that is still there. But it’s not something I feel awful about every day. Like I couldn’t even eat when it first happened, couldn’t watch a tv show, couldn’t be alone... it was extremely traumatising. 

But I just knew that going back to him and trying to talk would have stopped my healing. I think if you do cut all contact, remove her from social media or avoid social media yourself, archive your messages etc, your mind and body will just learn to cope. 

I’d say it took 2 weeks for me to go for a walk by myself and eat again, then 3 months in I wanted to start going on dates (even tho it felt so so wrong) I just wanted to talk to people. Then 6 months when I started seeing someone new, but it fell apart and I was a mess about my ex again. It was probably just me trying to cover up my feelings. 

Honestly it’s going to be a tough year year for you but you will be amazed at how well you can cope. You will probably learn a lot more things about yourself that you can take to a new relationship. And it’s a great life skill to learn to be independent again and move on from something like this. 

It sounds like you didn’t do anything wrong but I also put a lot of the blame on myself. That will ease up. Feel free to DM me if you want to chat further."
BreakUp,fpz7nqt,t3_ggav03,1589014679.0,"I had a similar experience where my ex of almost 5 years broke up with me out of the blue. I know it hurts like hell. We exchanged one text message but I didn’t beg him to come back. I really wanted to but I knew IF he did it would be because he felt bad or sorry for me, and his heart wouldn’t be in it.

The more you are reaching out to her and asking her to try again the more you are going to drive yourself crazy and just lose even more control over your life. 

It’s still very fresh for you so it’s normal to feel this way. It’s the most horrible thing I’ve ever been through, crying all the time, having breakdowns etc. Just feeling like I was at rock bottom. But what helped was going completely no contact. I blocked HIM on social media. Not even because I was angry but because it would hurt me so much more to see what he was up to.

You really need to go through the motions and NOT reach out. You will meet someone else in time, perhaps someone who is even more perfect for you. I know that seems impossible right now but chasing someone who doesn’t and to be with you will never lead to happiness. 

Take charge of your life again. Not every day will be better than the last, you will have ups and downs, but start making plans for YOUR life. If you don’t want to move back to London that’s fine. Make plans to travel for when coronavirus is over. Look for a new job. Get new hobbies. Do
Lots of exercise. Talk to your friends about how you feel.

It really sucks but things do start to get better, even in a couple of weeks or months but if you have any contact with her you’re just going back to day 1."

No one is perfect, no ones relationship is perfect. The fact that you are feeling bad shows you are a kind and empathetic person. I have heard stories of people cheating and not caring about the consequences, lying to their partner over and over again and I guarantee these people sleep easily at night. With regards to the OCD have you looked into Pure O and obsessive thoughts. Also look up ‘grey area’ thinking. Cause it sounds like your mind is furiously trying to settle on whether what you did is OK or not. The truth is most things in life are not black and white, and you must learn to live in the grey."

You will be pushed out of your comfort zone, go on new adventures, meet so many new people and learn so much about yourself. But honestly 3 months is still very early days so stop being so hard on yourself. 

One thing I would advise is definitely to go no contact. And it sound cheesy but throw yourself into work and finding new hobbies. It’s going to be hard, some days are going to be really tough.

Some of the ‘best’ people I know are single. I’ve been on dates and had people like me who I didn’t like back. Or I’ve liked them and the feel hasn’t been mutual. I do believe that it’s just a numbers game and you’re not ready to settle for just anyone because you’re lonely - that’s a good thing!

And btw I find it super upsetting sometimes to be single. I was broken up with last year and haven’t found anyone since then I’d want to settle down with.

BreakUp,fl6ja9k,t3_fmxc2n,1584871487.0,Yes DM me
NarcissisticAbuse,fl6g5y9,t3_fmrlvb,1584867360.0,"Whenever you say ANYTHING that can’t be perceived as criticism the narc will always go all angry pity party ‘why is everything always my fault?!!’ - I read this A LOT. 

He sound abusive and you’ve finally had enough. Once you’ve but him off emotionally it won’t even matter if you’re in his presence. So leave when it is safe for you to do so. On the other hand if you don’t feel safe living with him, is there someone you can stay with? Good luck!"
Anxiety,fl59l9p,t3_fmkayw,1584831617.0,"My chest feels tight all the time. Try to stop watching the news. And stay in doors. If you only leave the house for essentials once a week the chances are very low so that should help you keep calm. But yeah I’m sure a LOT of people are experiencing heightened anxiety right now, you’re not alone."
NarcissisticAbuse,fl4wotu,t1_fl4uaac,1584823231.0,"This!!! Mine was into drinking heavily then getting abusive. Also drug taking, by himself"
NarcissisticAbuse,fl4wkm7,t3_fme5iv,1584823152.0,"Yep, it’s probably because they don’t like working with other people because they can’t form good working relationships"
NarcissisticAbuse,fl24fwl,t3_fm0b22,1584742709.0,"This is so similar to my narc! He has a special way with words and that I find so attractive. He comes across deep and intellectual but on the flip side he’s a liar and shows no empathy. I was addicted to the intensity. We went back and forth for a few months and he’d always come back seeming so ‘reasonable’... usually after he got drunk and started behaving v weird, coming out with weird things. Like the other day he told me that for months he’s been using dating apps behind my back, but instead of saying it and feeling bad it sounded like he was trying to ‘act my ashamed, and yet it was completely transparent that he couldn’t feel any emotion about it. It’s hard to describe but it was super creepy. And I think it annoyed him when I didn’t get upset and instead calmly told him I never trusted him in the first place.

Honestly your narc will cross a line that will terrify you and you will NOT go back."
BreakUps,fl22mn6,t3_flopxw,1584741553.0,"Thank you, I can relate to this so much! I will definitely be looking up some of these books"
NarcissisticAbuse,fl079c4,t3_flnjbk,1584694659.0,"I said this to mine recently ‘you would throw me away’ and he’s like.... no I was always here. Right, so you’d just ignore my last message calling you out and respond a week later on a totally different subject 😂"
NarcissisticAbuse,fl06zfr,t3_flmyg8,1584694305.0,You should feel sorry for the women he is dating!!
BreakUp,fksa21y,t1_fks9jd6,1584485477.0,"Cause you were trying to see the best in him, we all do it. I think if people are upset and say or do stupid things that’s one thing but when they keep doing malicious things out of anger, that’s much more worrying. You absolutely will find someone who would never act like that!"
BreakUp,fks9dj8,t3_fkegry,1584485065.0,He is trying to hurt you in a really immature way. You don’t need that kind of person in your life.
NarcissisticAbuse,fkq7dpz,t3_fju671,1584433680.0,It’s always better to put positive vibes into the world than say something cruel. If they’re unable to do it back it just highlights how much of a good  and mature person you are.
BreakUp,fkeuzam,t1_fkeswmc,1584121234.0,"Yes that makes total sense. I like my alone time but I’m also love talking to people and really need connections to feel happy and safe and fulfilled. It’s like when you’re dying to reach out to someone, I can’t understand how they can just carry on and not give a shit"
BreakUp,fkeri9p,t1_fkeny6u,1584119168.0,I’m in a similar position to you now. Just stopped seeing someone who had some sort of personality disorder and just lied and had odd emotional responses to things. Not sure if he has any empathy. And YET I still miss him! It doesn’t make any sense. I just have to think it’s because I have emotions and I’m sad it couldn’t have worked out. Also I get quite attached to people and the feeling of being discarded doesn’t exactly feel great 🤷🏻‍♀️
BreakUp,fkenk91,t3_fi243u,1584116867.0,"It’s normal to feel sadness when someone you love has gone. Even if they hurt you, you can still care for them and miss them. I am also this type of person. You are probably more of an empath, which is why this hurt so much.

However, some people probably would have left this girl at the first sign of trouble. It sounds like she has manipulative tendencies and some sort of personality disorder.

When you meet someone else, try and look out for red flags earlier. Also it normally takes someone else to come along to make us forget our ex’s. You will be fine."
