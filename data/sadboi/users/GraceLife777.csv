EatingDisorders,fmfz5wv,t1_fmfz196,1586037907.0,It can be a wonderful tool but introduced gently and slowly. You have nothing to apologize for. You brought up something that can and does work. I just wanted to remind them that everything has to be taken slowly at first.
mentalhealth,fmfmoud,t3_fuqk4s,1586030479.0,I‚Äôm so sorry. That wasn‚Äôt okay for her to do that. I would recommend if you can telling a manager because that‚Äôs a type of harassment and just wrong in general. I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that.
EatingDisorders,fmfmfz7,t3_fuyyqg,1586030326.0,"I‚Äôm really proud of you! It took a lot to say all this and it‚Äôs taking a lot for you to do what you are doing. That‚Äôs amazing. You are so strong!

I can only offer what has worked for me. Which is premaking food that‚Äôs easy to get to. A certain amount of calories (whatever is healthy for your age/hieght) and then I don‚Äôt feel as guilty because all I did was eat up a pre made amount of food. I also allow myself to eat something special once a week - a few M&Ms or a candy bar and I work hard to not to purge. I have one friend who knows about my eating disorder. I‚Äôll tell them like hey I am gonna eat X can you help me out with counting down to 30 minutes? 
If at 30 minuets I‚Äôm still sick and feel the need to purge I will. But I started at only 10 minutes. Every few weeks as I‚Äôm able to make it past 30 I increase the time. 

I am praying for you. I‚Äôm aware of how hard this is to deal with and you are very strong to want to find ways to help yourself. Proud of you."
EatingDisorders,fmewu52,t3_furp5q,1586015250.0,"First off proud of you for talking about this. I know it‚Äôs really hard. We aren‚Äôt medical professionals but we want to help when and where we can. 

It does sound like you are dealing with an eating disorder. I definitely encourage you to talk to a medical professional because they will be able to help you safely get to a place you feel good about without risking your wellbeing. 

You are always welcome to DM me we can talk. I‚Äôve dealt with this kind of stuff before too and it‚Äôs a rough road but you can get through it. Have grace for yourself üíó it will be okay."
EatingDisorders,fmew901,t1_fmek3fn,1586014892.0,Yes see a medical professional. But it never hearts to hear from others in the same place. Just go into knowing they are professionals. Sometimes we need that extra confidence to say I‚Äôm not crazy I can be feeling this was and I‚Äôm not alone. Or at least that‚Äôs how I got the nerve to go talk to someone.
EatingDisorders,fmevn3o,t1_fme98q7,1586014520.0,I would caution about using calories or weight for anything just because it can be a trigger for people. So be careful. Don‚Äôt be harsh when saying something about calories. Gentleness is a huge key to this battle.
MentalHealthSupport,fmcdide,t3_fuawt7,1585943585.0,"Thank you for being her friend. I know from experience not all friends would do that. 

The attention is rough though for both of y‚Äôall. I suggest just not entering the conversation. Say thank you and move on to the next topic. It will die out soon enough as far as the conversation goes, but the impact you left will last a lifetime."
EatingDisorders,fmcd30i,t3_fu4uxj,1585943360.0,"Offer to share small meals with her. Cook something and ask her to have a few bites (eat most of it). Always tell her you love her. Be understanding. 

Ask her to eat with you. Even if it‚Äôs sharing fries or if she only had a few bites of your meals that‚Äôs better than nothing. Tell her she‚Äôs beautiful and prove it (hug her, play with her hair, show her you care about her) 

Be there to help her when she‚Äôs ready to move to a different place - it is a long hard journey. Let her know you are there to walk through it with her. Don‚Äôt give up. It will get better with time love and patience."
EatingDisorders,flykt44,t3_frsw2x,1585604018.0,Be gentle. Don‚Äôt get mad at her for purging or not wanting to eat. If she doesn‚Äôt want food get like her favorite fast food and share it so she doesn‚Äôt have to eat everything herself. Praise her for other things. Tell her you love her kindness or how she uses words or something. When she wears something that‚Äôs ‚Äúrisky‚Äù for her make sure she knows you love her in it. And talk about her not the outfit. It‚Äôs a long journey that requires patience and love. And a lot of steps backwards after a few steps forward.

EatingDisorders,flvk23z,t3_fr4pp0,1585525527.0,For now I say don‚Äôt change your diet. Do workouts you enjoy for fun. And as you go throw a piece of a fruit into your meal or drink an extra glass of water. Don‚Äôt feel like you have to go all in at one tome.
EatingDisorders,fl3vrya,t3_fme32m,1584799649.0,"These are all very real feelings. I‚Äôm glad you reached out. I‚Äôd like you to take a deep breath real fast. It appears there is a lot going on in your mind right now. 
It‚Äôs natural to feel like going back to something you can control. Or that gave you a feeling of control. These thoughts may be ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù in returning to old habits but you may be able to help yourself without going down that road again. I understand that is very scary. One thing that worked for me was when I‚Äôd have those thoughts or feelings I‚Äôd do 20 jumping jacks or some squats. Working out became my control. Eat a healthy as we can in this weird time. If you have fruit eat that before eating candy or something and remind yourself that is about the balance not immediate perfection. And lastly remember it‚Äôs not the end of the world if you do relapse. It‚Äôs a step into further healing and it‚Äôs something you can get through with support. Proud of you!!!"
EatingDisorders,fl2ja19,t3_fm203g,1584752347.0,"I want to encourage and say the relapses do go away with time. If you are still struggling that is okay it doesn‚Äôt mean you are not healing. It is just another stage of your journey. And you are being so brave to ask for help. Proud of you. 

Try waiting a period of time before you purge. It is okay to indulge in food even to binge eat sometimes. Try before purging to distract yourself for ten minutes or so and see how you feel after that. Could you go another five? Could you go even just another minute? If not then allow yourself the freedom to say this is a reaction to pain. Of course I don‚Äôt want you to feel so bad that you need to purge but I don‚Äôt want you to feel like you have to beat yourself up. 

Your emotions and feelings are valid. Let them be valid to you as well. Coloring is always helpful I think in calming down or scribbling on a paper. 

I‚Äôm praying for you sweet kid. Try and stay safe."
therapy,fl1sa7o,t1_fl1qw7u,1584735248.0,And tell them that. Let them know that talking works better for you. This worksheet might be a way for your therapist to get to know you better as well but never stay quiet. Tell them so they can help you. I told my online therapist today a lot and she said she wants to help not make me do things that are totally pointless.
therapy,fl1qdye,t3_fm1d5r,1584734148.0,It‚Äôs a way to help them help you. It‚Äôs a stepping stone to get you to your final destination. I would say give it a chance (at least a month or so) to see if this l process is helping. If not then tell them and say that it‚Äôs not the right approach for you.
mentalhealth,fkxrhn7,t3_fl0977,1584634007.0,Have you reached out to God? Jesus tells us He will never leave us. If we go to Him He will be near. He is my source of peace in this storm.

mentalhealth,fkxob2x,t3_fl0977,1584632242.0,Try and remember that 70% of people who get this get better. Even though it seems like the worst thing to happen our amazing scientists and doctors are already testing vaccines for this. Canada is as well and many other countries in fact the whole world is coming together looking for ways to help. It‚Äôs okay to be afraid. It‚Äôs okay to feel worried. It‚Äôs so valid to feel that right now. But try and remember all the good things good. It will help you feel calmer.

therapy,fkfonlm,t3_fi1k8m,1584139114.0,"I hear you. It can be scary, but remember that most people who get corona do get better. 
There are online options, and you can call your dr office and ask about doing Skype if they have to close. You can also talk to them over the phone if absolutely necessary. 

I personally believe that things will be okay we all need to wash our hands and sleep and drink water and be careful with what we touch. So I don‚Äôt think everything will close down. I think you‚Äôll be able to make it to your appointment because I know that‚Äôs very important. 

You are so brave. Everyone taking this news with mental health is so brave. Much love to y‚Äôall."
MentalHealthSupport,fkf8ggx,t1_fkf5q1r,1584129108.0,Of course! I have several ASD friends and I teach ASD students.

MentalHealthSupport,fkcuiyd,t3_fhm998,1584061459.0,"First off I‚Äôm so sorry love. I know that ASD can make things like this even harder. 

And yes this is rape and you should probably talk to someone about this and see what they can offer practically. I would personally report it, but I still recommend talking to a counselor or your parents and see how to go about that or see what they think. 

You all ways have the right to say no and if you don‚Äôt verbally say yes I want to do ______ then it‚Äôs not right for them to do it. I hope you figure this out and that you can move forward feeling better."

SuicideWatch,fk60vcc,t3_fge683,1583891495.0,USA has many online schooling options. I think UK does as well. I know how it feels to have no energy to work on homework (I'm suppose to be doing something right now). What I do is break it up and say - I will make myself do 5 minuets. Then I can have 30 minuets off. Then I will do 10 minuets. What ever I get done in these small amounts of time is all I get done. I don't know if that will work for you - but maybe it will spark a workable idea?
SuicideWatch,fk5zp7c,t3_fgek7z,1583890879.0,I'm sorry you are feeling this way.  I have been there (still go there sometimes) I hope you will reach out to someone (maybe someone on here or the crisis line). You matter a lot.
