BPD,fqbjpab,t3_ghwmzk,1589238252.0,"I live in the UK too, and have attempted to get a diagnosis once and was refused to be put forward to the evaluation team because the GP said ""nobody wants that label"". I'll be trying again after the virus stuff has passed, though."

BPD,fjcohv3,t3_fcpdqx,1583229534.0,aaaaand this is how I became a kpop stan.
BPD,fjcogsn,t3_fcpo7m,1583229490.0,Totally this. I need to express it but everyone else is too fucking busy with their own jobs to listen to me scream about how much I hate mine.
BPD,fjcobyb,t3_fcptyq,1583229295.0,"It takes me forever to quit, so I spend years in a job and just continue to be suicidal about it. Have just quit my current job so I can move, and I literally don't want another job where I have to leave the house."
childfree,fdk7s15,t1_fdk57yh,1578498024.0,We don't have any paid sick time where I work until you've been ill for more than 3 days and then you need a doctor's note.
childfree,fdk4y4s,t1_fdk4ges,1578496154.0,"I haven't. I've thought about it, but the one I'm on was obviously chosen for my combination of needs I guess? And have heard the implant can make your periods irregular and that's the last thing I need."
childfree,fdk2jxg,t1_fdk1ix0,1578494490.0,"No, I live in the UK and seeing the doctor is free but taking time out of my work day is the same as being ill - I don't get paid unless I'm at work or have pre-arranged holiday days. 

And I know it's common - it was to counteract when you said ""just use a condom"" to OP as that doesn't cover the other reasons people take BC for."
childfree,fdjzig6,t1_fdjy829,1578492227.0,"Not OP but a doctor's appointment would mean that I don't get paid for that period of time. And I work a fairly ""normal"" office job, 9-5:30. At the moment, my BC requires 3-monthly refills. I'm currently out which means I'm further fucking up my hormones trying to fit getting my BC around my work day. And these days, my BC is 50% for actual birth control and 50% for my hormonal acne and cramps."

BPD,fan9umh,t1_fan3m9u,1576230833.0,"Thank you for your empathy, but they might end up privatising our current free healthcare system... which would mean most people wouldn't be able to afford treatment they're currently receiving at little or no cost."
BPD,falvvwn,t3_e9v1gk,1576191366.0,I came here looking for this. I'm so fucking scared. Thank you.
UKPersonalFinance,fadgqgq,t3_e8gayl,1575970654.0,"I'm 29, I have almost 6K, I would be more comfortable with over 10k. Someone mentioned contributing to bills - I don't pay much rent but I do buy all my own food."
BPD,f9mf4um,t1_f9me115,1575455759.0,Thank you! Really glad to get some insight from someone who knows our healthcare system and stuff. I will put in a self-referral and see how far I get.
