isitnormal,fr0sln5,t1_fr09ay6,1589805698.0,"It seems odd on the surface, but there is a connection here. I think if you can treat that, you will be on your way to treating this issue. I have a very similar thing with food called ARFID (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder) which stems from my childhood, and possibly being on the ASD spectrum. I had a fear of choking and later on, getting sick, so i would have a physical reaction where it was hard to even make my body swallow food when eating to a point where i didn’t eat much at all. I am a lot better now, but still have some remnants of this. when I am eating sometimes, I may be mid meal but at some point my body is Jusf like, nope. You’re done. And it will be just some seemingly arbitrary cut off point where I just physically will shut down and cannot eat anymore. I combat this by eating really fast so I can get as much down as possible. So yeah I totally get that sensation. Like i Said, It’s definitely gotten better, but it’s a thing."

I think the thing that seems to differ is the amount of hormones and the physical size of the device. This one i have, has a lower dose of hormones than say, the Mirena. It just happened to be the one that Planned parenthood provides, and it works perfectly.

It absolutely can and does hurt for some people but it’s quick it’s really not as bad as one may think. Mine wasn’t bad. I actually had the copper one at first so i had that removed and the hormonal one inserted in one appointment. I had mild cramping and a pinch when it was inserted but it lasted like, 1 second, it was nothing. Also, I was on my period at the time so that helped since your cervix is more open during your period. That’s another thing, absolutely get it inserted when you’re on your period. It will be less painful. I would suggest taking a few ibuprofen and an anti anxiety medication or Benedryl as a substitute if you don’t have any."

Sometimes it happens at night and you won’t even know it. It can be treated with a mouth guard, as well as trying to reduce stress and anxiety if possible. Sometimes it’s a result of your bite being off which can be fixed with braces or other ortho treatment. Botox is another treatment option which relaxes your jaw muscles.
