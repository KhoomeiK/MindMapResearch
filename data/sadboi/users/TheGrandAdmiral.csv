LegendsOfTomorrow,fkynnet,t3_fjrq3p,1584652364.0,"I rarely cry when watching a show, but that goodbye was so excellently executed... LoT remained the only good show from the Arrowverse. 

I know it was done for the viewer's benefit, but I found it odd that they made it look so final, as if they can't see each other anymore. Nora and Ray are not dead, they can always pop up for a visit and also the fact that they are flying a time machine surely helps a lot."

FearTheWalkingDead,f1zprgl,t3_dal4g5,1569847566.0,"So what was the point of the episode? Half of it was them trying to get a herd of walkers, then Dwight screws things up. So it was all pointless? Also wasn't the herd bigger in the gulch? At least Virginia acted eeeeeeviiiil this time as I was getting worried that the ""good"" guys were the villains (though that would have been a nice twist). The wedding was nice."

FearTheWalkingDead,f18jq8w,t1_f18dc5s,1569258900.0,"I mean, yeah it looks like an extreme utilitarianism (though as I said in a post Apocalyptic world might not be so extreme). She doesn't seem that evil, Tom's sister seemed fine (unless I misunderstood things) and Logan seemed as a better villain."
FearTheWalkingDead,f189xvv,t1_f187kha,1569254694.0,"Well she seems rather tame compared to the Governor, Negan and the Whisperers. Given that it is a post Apocalyptic world with scarce resources."
FearTheWalkingDead,f17ltfj,t1_f0xrzmr,1569244898.0,"I was wondering the same thing. Compared to ""our"" people she seems reasonable. Surely she is not evil like the Governor or Negan (who actually makes sense, especially in the comics). She let go of Al and Morgan, she allowed the group to get a whole tanker, she saved them from Logan or whatever his name was. The whole ""useless"" people makes sense in a post-Apocalyptic setting. Yes, it is callous and brutal, but when it is about survival..."

As for Maxim, I mistook it for another men's magazine which makes steamier pics."

On the other hand I found people who actually listen and support me. So whenever I need a shoulder to cry on I go to them."
