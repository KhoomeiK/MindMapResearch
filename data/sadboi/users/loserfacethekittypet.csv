tucute,f5v7o93,t1_f5v6asw,1572484842.0,"That’s reasonable, I suppose I always thought of the tucute ideology as “if you aren’t lgbt you can go die, trans is a choice!” But I guess I was wrong. I think we should all live and let live, but sometimes I get stuck in the bad parts of communities and forget to let live. I don’t really see a reason to transition if you don’t have dysphoria, but I suppose if it makes you happy. (Sorry this was so scatter brain!)"
tucute,f5v4pe5,t1_f5v28k6,1572483622.0,"You could be right or maybe we’re both right in some ways. I think both of our communities have toxic parts, and the parts that aren’t toxic aren’t that different."

If a transmed is looking for tucutes to insult and bully then that is wrong. So maybe take a look at yourself before you go after others."
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,f5uwx5p,t1_f5uvbts,1572480535.0,"So is it ok for a truscum to be rude or bully a tucute saying that truscum should die? (Have you seen any “die tucute” posts? I sure haven’t.) I can link multiple “die truscum” posts.

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,f5usgr1,t1_f5ur95k,1572478551.0,You clearly don’t understand where the term truscum and tucute came from. Truscum is short for “true transsexual scum” and tucute is short for “too cute to be cis” these terms just prove that tucutes are mean too. Tucutes are normally the ones that bully and berate truscum. Also I am a generally happy person and as a victim of bullying I would never hurt another human being because I know how much it hurts.
