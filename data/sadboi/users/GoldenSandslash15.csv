When you scan an item at the checkout, not only does it charge the customer for the item, but it also alerts the computer that the item was sold, so the computer orders a replacement. More than 90% of Walmart's inventory is ordered by the computer.

If they scanned one bible but then gave you another, then the computer would replace the ""wrong"" one, and then the store's shelves would have too many of one kind of bible and not enough of the other.

In general, when this happens, the cashier will allow the customer to do this substitution anyways (sometimes getting supervisor approval, sometimes not) simply because it's not worth the time or effort of fixing the issue and leaving the customer with a bad experience.

But technically, the company does train employees to think that this is wrong.

Let's suppose we lived in a world where every Companion was abysmally awful. They were unplayably bad. No one ever ran them in any deck whatsoever. Would Companion still be among the worst mechanics ever printed? Yes.

Here's why.

When Richard Garfield designed Magic, he wanted to create ""a game bigger than its box"". This meant that there was more than just the cards you got.

Allow me to offer a comparison to another popular game: Monopoly. Every single time you play Monopoly, you're playing the same game. There's the same 40 squares on the board each time. That's not the case for Magic. With Magic, each game is different, depending on what cards you include in your deck and which cards your opponent includes in theirs. Imagine a Monopoly game with no Boardwalk, or a Boardwalk that wasn't the most expensive property, or eight railroads, or none, or color-groups that require four or five properties to get a monopoly. Each time you played, you wouldn't know what was included in the game until you started playing. That's Magic. Every game is unique.

Companion completely undermines this entire thing. Even if Companions were unplayably bad, they go against what Magic is supposed to be. The variance of Magic is the lifeblood of the game and Companion is killing that variance. They're making each game play the same.

If I wanted to play a game like that, I'd go play Monopoly. But I don't want to play Monopoly. I want to play Magic. And it's just becoming increasingly difficult to do so, primarily due to Companions. Making Companions, even ones that aren't powerful at all, means that you are actively telling me that you don't want me to play Magic."

> Why five colors?

It's rooted in games that Richard Garfield and his friends were making in the '80s. And a popular book at the time was ""The Master of the Five Magics"". It also enabled ""two allies and two enemies"" for each color. And it allows for many possibilities.

> Was it always those five colors?

Yes. And it was always the five basic land types, except for Island, which was Lake for a bit, since it felt weird to have one type of land that would be disconnected from others.

> Why 20 life?

It was chosen arbitrarily and then the game designed to accommodate it, so it worked well. No other number was ever tried.

> Why seven card hands?

It was the standard in playing card games.

> Why a 40-card deck (it would later become 60)?

We expected people to buy only a single starter deck and one or two booster packs. If that's all you have, then 40 lets you easily strip down the 60-card starter deck to something that you can work with.

> Magic started with seven card types (Artifact, Enchantment, Creature, Land, Instant, Sorcery, Interrupt). Which came first?

Land came first, followed by Creature and then ""Spell"" (which would later be broken down into Instant, Sorcery and Interrupt). The idea behind Magic was two kinds of cards: lands and nonlands. You had a resource, and things you could play by spending that resource. Then there were two card types for nonlands: permanents that affected the board, and one-time effects. Spells were originally Instants, as we realized we needed to include counterspells as an option. The split between Sorcery and Instant happened very early.

> What was the alpha version of Magic like?

You combined decks with your opponent, and then drew off of that 120-card deck. We added artifacts and enchantments during this time. Enchantments predate artifacts. Auras came before global enchantments. But both types of enchantments happened at around the same time. Circles of Protection were early designs.

> Did color-hosers happen early?

Yes.

> What about interrupts?

Interrupt was the card type that came last. It happened as we were figuring out how timing worked ""under the hood"" of the game, and we realized that some instants had to be faster than other instants otherwise a counterspell wouldn't work. Later we realized this was a mistake and the stack was a better idea.

> Let's talk about evergreen keywords. Which came first?

I think flying.

> How did that get designed?

It just made sense that a person couldn't block a bird. I designed a lot of creatures, and for many of them, their defining trait was that they flew, so I knew I wanted to translate it to gameplay terms.

> Which keyword came second?

Regeneration. A lot of characters had their defining trait be that they regenerate. Maybe landwalk was second, that one also came early. It was more of a bottom-up design, starting with the mechanic and then figuring out the flavor, rather than the other way around. Trample was next. First strike came very late. Banding was also late.

> How did banding happen?

I wanted creatures to be able to team up with each other, and so I needed to design a mechanic to make that happen.

> How did you decide what to keyword?

I had a gut feeling about how common each would be. Sometimes I was wrong, there's not a lot of trample in Alpha, for example. But if you have a good mechanic, having a name associated with it is powerful. Calling trample ""trample"" rather than writing it out gave it flavor and made it seem more appealing to players.

> Of course, nowadays we have a lot of keywords. How do you feel about that?

I like it. Again, keywords are power from a flavor perspective. My favorite is vigilance. I'm glad I didn't name it, because I would not have had as good of a name for it. Of course, I didn't have reminder text in Alpha, and that definitely limits the upper-limit on keywords.

> You added a rule to the game that said that if you run out of cards, you lose. When did that come up?

During our first-ever playtest. We realized that if both players ran out of cards, the game would just indefinitely stall, so we quickly learned that we had to make a rule of what happens if you run out of cards. Many board games have a rule that if you can't make a move, you lose, so it felt natural. And then it became an alternative way to win. You can even build a deck around it. Of course, the optimal strategy in a TCG is to make as small of a deck as legally possible, but making you lose the game when you run out of cards is incentive to add more cards.

> What cards stand out to you as signposts for being the best designs in Alpha?

The basic lands. Being very different from the spells of the game is nice. Blue getting all the whacky cards (back then, ""drawing cards"" is whacky) was a sign that the game was going in the right direction.

> Is there a single card that captures Alpha to you?

No.

> What card was added late that you are happy got into the game and didn't just barely miss it?

There's a lot of those. Birds of Paradise was the very last design in Alpha, and it was a beloved card. Another late card was Goblin Balloon Brigade, and I'm happy about that, because it's a simplistic design, but it tells a story of a Goblin inflating a balloon.

> What's your favorite card from Alpha?

Nightmare, Force of Nature, and Lord of the Pit.

> How did you come up with the idea of using power and toughness?

I knew creatures needed an offensive power, and so then they clearly needed hit points as a result. We never really did play with damage sticking around. The stats were always two numbers. We never tried one or three. Like, creatures never had a speed stat, for instance.

> Looking back with 20/20 hindsight, what is the thing you most wish you had done in Alpha?

Hands-down, the stack. I wish the stack had existed from the beginning. Playing without a stack is fine in freeform casual play without hard rules and just people playing with whatever ""feels right"", but it becomes a nightmare when you have to formalize it with officially-enforced rules. Interrupts helped to make the ""batch"" system worked, but they didn't do it very well. The stack does it better.

> Anything that you wish I had asked you?

""What mechanics didn't make it in?"" And there's quite a few of those. We had originally had a lot more cards that swapped ownership of cards permanently. Ante was the last remnant of that. There was a fun one called ""Ecoshift"" which would shuffle both players' lands together and then distribute them back to each player based on how many you had beforehand. There was another ""Pixie"" card that was a flying creature, and every time it hit a player, you and that player would shuffle your hands together and distribute them in a similar fashion. But it became clear that some players weren't really in it to win, they'd just play to get more cards, so they'd fill their decks with trash cards that they wanted to get rid of, and cards to help them get rid of those in exchange for better cards. I did this in case players didn't want to trade. I wanted an option for players to obtain cards without having to negotiate. Ante survived simply because it still encouraged players to play to win. You couldn't build a deck solely based around getting more cards without also trying to win the game.

> Ante was inspired by marbles, right?

Yes. Marbles were collectibles that were also wagered in gameplay, and widely enjoyed by players."

I agree completely. I want Companions to be removed from Vintage. But I do think it's important that Vintage allows all the cards (except for the ones that it literally cannot). As such, a ban is not the answer. I'd much rather them do something else. And I already proposed something above: ""Cards with a Companion ability function as though they did not have that ability."" Thus, Companions are gone, but there are no bans needed.

But that's just my idea. It has become clear that Wizards disagrees with me and would rather just ban cards in Vintage, which, in my opinion, goes against what Vintage is supposed to be doing."
magicTCG,fpq7rrj,t1_fpq5ihc,1588816878.0,"Vintage does allow you to play ALL of your cards, except for the small few that don't function within Magic's current rulebook. Ante/Dexterity/Subgame/Conspiracy cards don't work anymore, for the reasons I outlined above. So does Vintage allow all cards? Technically no, but they do allow as many as they can possibly allow before the rules stop functioning.

And yes, I do know that Mark Rosewater said that Vintage bans are on the table. I think that this is a poor decision, though. As it stands now, the Vintage banlist is straightforward: it's all the cards that don't work in a tournament setting. Period. I think that it becomes a lot weirder if you say that the banlist is ""cards that don't work in a tournament setting. Oh and also Lurrus"". After all, if you ban Lurrus, a card that works well with the tournament structure but it's just too powerful, then where do you draw the line? How do we know they won't later ban Time Vault? Ancestral Recall? Black Lotus? Moxen? It creates uncertainty, and I don't like it. I really hope that they find some other way to solve the problem than Vintage bans, because there needs to be a format where all cards are allowed (except those that don't play nicely with Magic's tournament structure). If there isn't, well, let's examine that.

Suppose that they were to ban Time Vault in all formats. Now, you're telling every player who has a Time Vault in their collection that this card may as well just be a piece of poop, for all the good that it'll do them to have it. That's not good. It's true that Lurrus wouldn't be as bad, because even if you ban it in Pioneer/Modern/Legacy/Vintage, you could still use it in Standard. But that'll only last a year and a half or so. Once its time in Standard runs out, it's done, and then it's on the same level as Time Vault would be in this hypothetical scenario."
magicTCG,fppwvzw,t1_fpptkcm,1588810728.0,"No card is banned in Vintage for power-level reasons. They're only banned because they interfere with the tournament structure.

* Ante cards interfere by virtue of being illegal under most countries' gambling laws.
* Dexterity cards interfere because they have the issue of players wanting to spread their permanents out across a huge space, and tournament organizers may not have the space.
* Subgame cards interfere because they also require a lot of space (since you need to make room for the subgame while still leaving the main game intact, in order to come back to it later -- and of course, it gets even worse if you go multiple layers deep with sub-subgames and sub-sub-subgames and so on). In addition, they also require a full game of Magic be played while a spell is resolving, requiring far more time than tournaments allow. I don't know how Wizards expected tournament organizers to be able to create time and space, considering, you know, the laws of physics, but it nonetheless interferes with the tournament structure.
* Conspiracy cards only exist in Limited because there is no cost associated to playing them -- not even the cost of a deck slot. The only ""cost"" is that it takes up your pick from that pack in the draft. As this isn't a cost at all in Constructed, they are naturally not allowed. Admittedly, allowing them isn't about causing issues with the tournament structure, but they still nonetheless are a problem. They're in the same realm of ""pseudo-existence"" as planes, phenomena, schemes, and vanguards. The only reason why they need to be listed on a banlist is because, unlike those other pseudo-existent cards, Conspiracies are normal-sized and not oversized (so that they can be drafted alongside normal cards)."

I think that makes a return to Alara MORE likely, since it means that Ikoria was substantially different. It means that we can have two planes: one focused on tri-color and one focused on monsters with tri-color as a background theme. They're very different.

Hypothetically, if Ikoria was primarily focused on tri-color, then that'd ruin Alara's chances a lot more, since it means that they'd be too similar to each other. Why go back to Alara when Ikoria does the same thing?
