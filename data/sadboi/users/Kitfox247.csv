Not just survives, but exploded in growth. 


A year ago I transplanted it from being grown in water and looking like it wasnt enjoying its water home anymore into soil, and within a few months 5 baby plants burst to life around her. The babies have much bigger leaves than Shelly's plant, and I just recently transplanted the babies into their own pots.


I have the intentions to gift these to my dad and mom and all my siblings as a fathers day present, and it would be wonderful to present him with a name for the plant as well 😊"

Oh, i get ya! Yeah, i love the flavor appearances too. Only one of my players decided to be something that wasnt given (we have a mapach, gallus and the vulpin), the raptor of the party decided he wanted to be a penguin with a superiority complex, and i loved it. I let him switch out flying for swim speed (which i realised later that there was the water version of the raptor but we had already moved on. It doesnt really affect too much, if anything it adds flavor.). Also he's a sorcerer so he raises up into the air when he casts specific spells, and i love the irony of that. 

One of the coolest things of humblewood is that it is loose while being detailed. It gives you enough to know what's important to keep in and the rest can just be fun filler stuff. Maybe that's just how i've been running it, but still :)"
humblewood,fnez9h2,t1_fneqqno,1586898564.0,"Nice, i like how you've set up the scale of the world map. I ended up breaking the road to alderheart into 3 chunks on the map before the trek out. first night stopped in that clearing with just the one tree in it, second night is midway through, and then there's Alderheart on day three, getting there at night. (i did this also to make sure that the birdfolk council would be ""closed"" for the night and force them to explore alderheart before just going straight up to the birdfolk council like they were wanting to.) It definitely didnt really make too much sense in terms of the trek they did to the mokkden caverns... though there was some difficult terrain down there they had to travel over.

One of my players is a follower of hanera, so i prepared a temple for him to track down in alderheart (i told him he knew of a major temple located somwhere here) and witnessed first hand the injustices when a hungry Hedge child tried to sneak into the temple and grab something off of the heaps of food piled upon the offering plates and pots. The Perch guard stationed there stopped the child and the player took the bait, standing up for the child and convincing the guard to let him take it, for it would be what Hanera would expect all of them to treat the less fortunate and to take care of each other. It was a fun moment and really developed this characters purpose further. :D 

As for the Vulpin- there's a samurai subclass of fighter that's in Xan's guide, so he's literally a Vulpin Samurai that lives by a code of honor. :)  His backstory is that his family was paid to look after a noble family for generations and one day (recently) an assassin surprised them all and killed everyone in the perch, and the Vulpin's father."
humblewood,fnejact,t1_fneg4vd,1586890376.0,"Yeah, exactly, it's a tough sell. When you get to the birdfolk council there's a blip of some important info on why they would push that back. After reading that it made some ""sense"", but really it just made me think of the Trump Administration which makes me hate the Birdfolk council along with my party members probably taking a dislike to them (they're going to be meeting with them in the next session).

This is the background info that's in the pdf -
""Use this pool of information to inform the  Council’s behavior:  ""

""The Council is aware of the spreading fires, but their primary concern is banditry jeopardizing the big city and essential trading hubs. The bandit ranks have swelled of late, and the Perch Guard can only be spread so thin...""

""The Council knows that Alderheart could support more refugees, but they prefer to remain cautious in these difficult times. The fires keep spreading, after all. If all the refugees are allowed to enter, how long before the city runs out of food and other essential resources?....They assure the party that aid will be sent, but ask for their patience during these trying times. Sending a cart of supplies along bandit-ridden roads will not be easy, and any guards they send as an escort will mean less protection for the Alderites ""

The Birdfolk council is really only concerned with the livelyhoods of those already in Alderheart. They know they can fit more but if that lowers the quality of life of the others.... Meh! - says the birdfolk council. 

I'm assuming you're asking about how i handled Krane specifically, yeah? So, keep in mind this is my first game that i've ever run. So when the party was not into doing extra for free, and not even for 5g each, so Krane ended up offering them each gold AND the letter if they go out to find Kenna. When they came back he was not amused that Kenna offered some of his gold for the help of the party to collect some live slime specimens. Pretty much done with talking to the group for the day, he tried to push off writing the letter for them (per the book, he says that there is an urgent matter to attend to so he'll get them the letter tomorrow) but the party wasnt having it. ""you cant just spend 10 min to write some words on the page? It's me, Magistrate Krane, i request...."" the player pretty much outlines an entire letter and towards the end i just had Krane get flustered (after a majorly successful intimidation check from our samurai vulpin) and write the letter to get them out of the office. 

The session ended close to there, and with their talks of leaving first thing in the morning for Alderheart i was kind of bummed that they pretty much bypassed the Swamp Witch. I was afraid that they might never come back this way if they didnt think there was a reason to. After some brainstorming over the next couple weeks, i decided that they can still experience the Swamp Witch and that i can just plant the seed before they leave. The only thing they really miss out on is getting an ally that can make potions for them out of supplies they find. 

I had the Perch Guard knock on their tavern door before Elisa could, and tell them that Magistrate Krane request their presence for an urgent matter. I knew the party wouldnt be into chasing down a witch in the swamp just because Krane said she is evil and causing a bunch of the problems around here. He had no proof, only stories. It just seemed like he had a personal vendetta against her, so the party said that they would only do it for more gold than he was offering. Also that they would be coming back eventually so maybe they can check it out if he comes up with more evidence while they're gone to Alderheart. So the seed was planted, maybe i can come up with some convincing evidence that would perk their interest to at least go out and see what's going on out there. :) 

Dunno if that helps any but that's just what is happening in my game right now hehe"
humblewood,fneegj3,t3_g19yx4,1586887910.0,"it's kind of railroady in the beginning. My players were aware that it would be that way for a little bit, though, so it didnt really bother them. There were a couple things that i kind of had to have the magistrate bribe them more for things having to do with their quests.. and there are a couple places where they're promised something after they do the task, and then it's ""but wait- do this one thing and THEN i'll do that"". I didnt like that, they did the thing and earned their reward and so i rearranged the quest around so that it would just be a separate experience, not being forced to do it just because they want to move on. Plus, they were sent out to deliver an important message of everyone in danger but first do this quest? It just didnt really make much sense to me so i changed it slightly there.

There are some parts in future situations that i'm not sure how far we'll get through (judging by the characters that my players made). They will probably not enjoy doing things for the government, one of the character's backstory makes him have a distrust for birdfolk from the upper class, and a lot of what you are up to  in the beginning is about seeing injustice forced upon innocent people of the Wood, which made them want to adhere to any rules or requests even less. I'm not sure how much longer we will be following the campaign. It seems like they're edging closer to revolution and rejecting those that are ignoring the incoming threat and treating things as business as usual. ""The people need a voice!"" is something a character said and the others rallied behind. so now i'm like, well i was thinking of doing this but i may have to take off the training wheels soon and treat this more like a guide and not a to-do list...""

introvert,fgj74l8,t1_fgihujj,1580838253.0,"I have spoken to my sister about it. She told me that sometimes people need to be the ones who reach out always and that she is that person to some friends of hers, but that they keep in contact through sending memes or whatever. She mentioned that most all the time she feels l lik le her life is boring from going to work and now school that she doesnt feel the need to reach out and talk about it. This conversation happened a couple years ago, and I will admit from then to now I have shown her too much of the insecure side of me...  though it was during a time that I was so desperate to hear from her that I just accepted this response. 

 I have tried following her advice by sending memes and stuff but she has stopped opening my Instagram/fb messages, leaving them unread. When I text her sometimes it takes a day or so for her to get back to me, though she does say something back, and she usually seems interested in doing something in that moment with me. If we make plans, especially lately since she started school, she will end up canceling the day of. It's just confusing.

I dont know if her own anxiety is getting in the way. I know that when I was in school I didn't reach out to anyone and no one really reached out to me, though this was before my sis and I had a relationship. We just sort of mended things a few years ago. I feel like I'm being too pushy in wanting a relationship with my sister, and I'm probably pushing her away with being overbearing. I feel like I've used up all ability to bring something like this up without her rolling her eyes and being like ""I dont hate you, I'm just busy!"" But is it so hard to send a text every now and then?

 I feel like if I back off then I wont hear from her for months and we will start to lose contact again, or that I will be completely lost in what is going on in her life. It seems like she doesnt have interest to see what's going on with me, but if I reach out and say what I've been doing, she will respond with a that's really cool! Or something... A couple back and forth messages from that and then that's it. Is that how sibling relationships are? I dont have much to compare it to. All my family is a bit standoffish."

They might add or simplify movement so it's not a 1-1 copy and the stuff that is being imagined kind of nullify any sort of head start you would get from rotoscoping the scene, but it's a great starting point for the physicality in the scene.

Maya,eu9bej9,t3_cfckvy,1563576178.0,"Couple things:   
If they are constrained and you've placed a key on the mesh somehow it will key the mesh in place like that.   


I have run into the problem of adding separate mesh objects in the same rig to a display layer will ""break"" the link between the mesh in the display layer and the rig. Removing them from the display layer fixes this.   


It could be a rig issue, or a parent constraint issue, also.."
FrameByFrame,eu6epgd,t1_eu564a9,1563498602.0,Your response is extreme to me. The teacher's way of teaching is fine. More structure is better for those who are learning.
FrameByFrame,eu6eacc,t3_cevdoc,1563498321.0,"In short, yes. Keep going with what each instructor is telling you. You're going to be working from both ends working towards the same goal, and you'll stronger for it.

In terms of how your 3d instructor is teaching, it is the same thing as using an image when drawing to get proportions down and then using it as a guideline from there. Animation is exaggeration from life experiences. We don't  need to be tied to it ball-and-chain, but by charting key frames in an existing reference you're going to get to the end point quicker than if you are trying to do it from your head, especially when you're just starting out. Pay attention to what works and what doesnt. Why does this feel like a rubber ball vs. a bowlling ball? It is all in the timing. As a professional animator i will say that working from reference videos (either found or recorded yourself) is pretty standard in the industry and is not cheating at all. Just get that out of your mind and do what your instructors instruct you to do, and soon enough you'll be able to use the reference as a guideline and not as a rulebook.

And yes, love your graph editor. The more you use it and understand what the curves mean, the stronger your animations will be."

The shine seems silvery I would say... is not like a translucent shine, as it completely blocks out the color when it glints in the light."
