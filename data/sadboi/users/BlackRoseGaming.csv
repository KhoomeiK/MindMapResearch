So I'm an accounting major right now in my ""junior"" year (my degree will take a year longer than expected so this is my 4th year but I'm classified as a junior.) My ex and I started dating our freshman year of college and basically had our schedules put together like puzzle pieces. Quickly the majority of my time was with him when not in class, or waiting for him to be free after I was done with class, since he was busier than I. Due to that and some other relationship issues I was pretty isolated, honestly. Our relationship had its toxic cycle and I finally walked away for good a little before Christmas last year.. We had been together a little over 3 years.

So starting this semester my life was very different and I suddenly had all that free time back. I scheduled myself out and I'm spending time with friends I basically 75% ghosted for the sake of that relationship, I'm trying to make new friends and do things that I enjoy more often. It's a lot of fresh air, but sometimes I do have to remind myself that I walked away from something that wasn't getting better and wouldn't have if I stayed where I was."

So if you were selling a bunch or dragons, using them to level, or to rate up other dragons, you wouldn't be able to click those locked dragons. 
Comes in handy if you have any 3* dragons you want to keep since they aren't locked upon receiving/hatching them but you can manually lock them. 
Also comes in handy when you have multiples of a dragon. You can lock the one you want to keep and unlock the ones you want to use for skill ups or enhance, etc. Same goes for mastery.
I think the lock becomes very useful when you have lots of dragons, keeps you from having to go through each one sometimes.

Edit: Just answering the ""why are they locked?"" question, the other comment answered well about how to toggle the lock."

So that's a little over 3 years in school. I'm an accounting major and he's in music performance so while I'm relatively busy, he's almost always busy or should be. Often whenever we had free time we would chill together, spend the night with eachother here and there. Little holidays (a day or two/long weekend) in the school year would be spent together, too. We'd go to nearby restaurants for cute dates and accompany one another whenever leaving campus (walking, we dont have our cars with us.) When he has concerts and if his family comes to visit then I was always there. We had some mutual friends so we would host get togethers and little potlucks, or just hang as a group on weekends and such. We often just enjoyed spending time with eachother so we would also do homework together or be together even if one of us is working and the other is playing video games or whatever.

I'm in college and I've had a lot of setbacks, leading to my degree taking more than the initial intended 4 years. 
""School"" is 'fine,' still me going to class everyday, getting homework I gotta do, the need for me to study, getting grades, etc.

If school is bad then answering truthfully leads to more questions and frankly if I'm on a break from school I promise school is the last thing I'd like to talk about. Not to mention I'm more than just a student.

If school is good then they still ask more questions. ""Last year right?"" Or ""What year are you?"" Shit man I'm on my 4th year but I'm still a ""junior"" and as soon as they know I'm graduating later than intended they start trying to troubleshoot me. I don't need anyone to CTRL+G my situation. The waves of disappointment from family and others doesn't help or make me want to talk about the conversation any more either.

It's just an ""I'm already tired, can we not?"" type of question for me."

I understand, my brain and heart are always in different places. Making decisions gets very hard for me. Sometimes outside opinions help me stay rational and logical, plus sometimes it keeps me from feeling crazy. I hope I helped with the mental war at least a little.
Just gotta remember you're always gonna have feelings (in general) and it doesn't always mean you have to change what you're doing. 
Leaving her and missing her is better than staying with her or going back to her and being abused. 
Having random ""I wonder if she's doing okay"" thoughts are better than ""I know she's still hurting me and I don't deserve it, but I'm still here"" especially adding that her hurting you will definitely still hurt, maybe even more so if you go back.

Obviously if she isn't feeling the relationship, it wouldn't be healthy to stay together, but if that isn't the case then showing her how you feel and how important she is to you could help put things in perspective (and maybe make her feel better, depending on how she feels.) Let her explain what's going on in her heart and mind, respond accordingly and stay civil.

singing,erswafn,t1_ersrpn7,1561225877.0,"Well bad feedback is incentive to just not upload, it avoids that issue. I feel like it's maybe a protective mechanism because he knows that he's a vocal coach that doesn't exactly sound like a god. He's always going to get slammed for that because people think that if you're going to 'criticize' (good or bad) singers and speak on your technique, then he should be able to do better. Frankly no matter how much knowledge he has, he can't just be the best example. So it looks to a lot of people like he's just talking cause he can't meet their opinion of how a vocal coach could be etc. If that makes sense.

Vocal teachers without a great voice will always be a thing because you don't need to have a great voice to study the subject, plus you can't help your voice any more than vocal training itself can. By default there are going to be people interested who aren't able to be vocally where they wish they were. If they go into the subject and become a vocal coach - it is what it is. I'm sure people prefer a vocal teacher who seemingly has great vocal ability (cause it's one of those things that make people think 'oh duh') but ability is also more technical rather than a voice that's ear appealing. If anything, and maybe you meant this, I'm not sure, but non-vocally blessed (idk another way to word that haha) vocal trainers may lose business because like you, people generally are going to prefer someone helping them improve their singing to have a voice that appeals to them. In my opinion for this subject, that's essentially natural selection. Many people think that you must have a nice voice if you're a technically good singer when it just isn't how things work. Just because I know how to switch registers doesn't mean any of mine will sound good to anyone, likewise I could be an awesome teacher too."
singing,ers7nk9,t3_c3h8jl,1561204102.0,"In my opinion he's decent. His voice isn't that special, he just trained the voice he has which in turn made his vocals better. None of that being negative though, and he's spoken on it himself in a video on his channel. 
He can carry a tune and he knows technique so technically he is good, however when it comes to sound it's of course to each their own. I just dont think he has a wow factor in his voice, not very much personality - but maybe I just haven't heard enough of his content.

Also, when it comes to training and charging for it, he understands voice as a subject. You don't have to have a nice voice for that so although it seems like it should be hand and hand, it doesn't always work that way. 
Likewise there are plenty of people with lovely singing voices and no control or technique whatsoever or who find it hard to actually control their voice.
It's training so practice makes better but at the same time people can only do so much with the voice they are born with."

Let her know that hey, stuff gets complicated but at the end of the day I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Tell her that everything else doesn't make a big difference. Show her that even though the wedding could go so many ways, this moment is special and you guys can and shall be happy whether families are being difficult or not. 

I think it would mean more to focus on the point of the moment rather than trying to make up for slack that isn't the fault of either of you.

Usually I'll get emails from Fafsa or my school if I need to take action. Lastly my mother is helping me pay for college so I would think they would call the house phone or her cell phone rather than my cell phone. 

Do you have any info about these calls? 
If implemented changes are causing people to need to look at repayment options again then I think pretty much everyone would be getting the call, so I'm confused.
Please let me know if this sounds like spam or if it's serious and I should talk to my mom before any important dates pass.

Thanks for making this thread :)"
