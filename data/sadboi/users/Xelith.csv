NoStupidQuestions,fns54ml,t3_g3m3z4,1587212939.0,"Of course not. What you are describing would perfectly fit any storyteller (novelists, script writers, comic artists, game designers). We have a lot of amazing fictional stories because of people like you with rich fantasies!"
LissandraMains,fm12oq3,t1_flye450,1585670884.0,Here's to hoping they will both get one next year. I think they would look fantastic
leagueoflegends,flgnj5p,t1_fle7m8o,1585146581.0,"This is my favorite, really well done actually."
leagueoflegends,flghkdv,t1_fks2wa8,1585142740.0,"You are right, but even then it doesn't make a significant difference. Not to mention the odds of you getting S- or higher every single game with 4 premades while winning all of them as well as them being appropriately long games. Realistically, 20 games are the bare minimum."
leagueoflegends,flghatf,t1_fldaz7e,1585142549.0,"Necrit's youtube channel is very lore focused, I recommend browsing it until you find something you're interested in and start from there :)"
leagueoflegends,flgh65y,t1_flde47d,1585142456.0,"Hold tight, queue times should improve once the virus settles down and people start leaving their homes again."
leagueoflegends,flgglf8,t1_flew767,1585142059.0,This. Everyone's at home right now playing games and it puts a toll on servers.
leagueoflegends,flgfzit,t1_flf0g3r,1585141639.0,"You need to go to [this site](https://update-account.riotgames.com/) to update your account. If you want to keep your original login info on your main, then log into your EUW account on that site and change your login name, then you will be able to log into your NA account normally without having to change it."
leagueoflegends,flgfnxo,t1_flfvgya,1585141391.0,"Yes, and another important thing is that it makes it harder for skillshots to hit you. This is also really useful in laning phase while farming against heavy poke."
leagueoflegends,flgfal0,t1_flgcrr7,1585141109.0,"Damn, what's your winrate and in how many games? Skipping divisions is harder this season."
leagueoflegends,fkpvi43,t1_fkpjdb2,1584420638.0,"You can't get mastery 5 with just 10 games, even if you win all of them. About 1100 for a win and mastery 5 requires 22,000, which is double what you would get with 10 wins. You can get mastery 5 in 20 games if they are long enough and you win every single one of them."
leagueoflegends,fkpu6p0,t1_fkogddc,1584419508.0,"I have 150,000+ on 7, almost 8 champions. Oof, I really have no life."
lux,fjjpciw,t1_fjjggzp,1583407337.0,"If you have a PBE account, you should use it to try and decide. That's what I will do if I can't get both :)"
lux,fjfqodw,t1_fbkpjch,1583297720.0,"She just got two galaxy skins, so now that's out the window :P"
lux,fjfbwsq,t1_fjeyqy3,1583288581.0,"Yeah. I main Lux, Syndra AND Lissandra (most points on Lux with 450k) and I'm still upset she got the skins because of that icon lol."
SuicideWatch,fhu6av7,t1_fhnw45h,1581882521.0,I rarely think about it haha
SuicideWatch,fhnvpe4,t1_fh9hi8b,1581733599.0,"It's not harmful to me or to others, I think I'll be fine."
discordapp,fgke33d,t1_fghlpd7,1580863412.0,"In what way is the UI ""better"" now?"
medicase,ff862n8,t3_epowew,1579667010.0,That looks kinda badass.
anime,fdu8zwy,t3_en2m51,1578729660.0,"That's really cute, I love your style."
leagueoflegends,f9iawj5,t1_f9hu7u4,1575332546.0,"You still have your season 9 rank, there aren't even new placements yet, so those count."
leagueoflegends,f9iar9e,t1_f9hkpcl,1575332442.0,What if you hover over your honor level on your profile? Mine says I need to be honor level 2 to play Clash. I'm on the NA server.
leagueoflegends,f9i83bs,t1_f9fzirq,1575330558.0,"Same. End of season 5 is when I started, and I still don't have a champs. Honestly I'm probably missing like 50 if not more."
QiyanaMains,f829sdr,t1_f78nytv,1574186982.0,Send a ticket to Riot so they can refund your tokens and you get the skin.
discordapp,f27m4pn,t1_f0rpb9k,1570041286.0,"Yeah, my bad."
SuicideWatch,f27lz23,t1_f273rit,1570041187.0,"Some things you can't cure entirely, but you can work towards bettering it. I hope you'll be able to transition if you haven't yet, and if you have, I hope you figure out a way to feel better in your own skin."
SuicideWatch,f27lmyu,t1_f26ugt0,1570040977.0,That's not entirely true but it could be said about most things.
SuicideWatch,f27j76v,t1_f26zgak,1570039423.0,"Her being mentally unstable wasn't your fault. I can relate to what you said, but no one's suicide is another person's fault."
SuicideWatch,f27j1ex,t1_f26fnrc,1570039321.0,"Agreed, she is a big part of the problem."
SuicideWatch,f27iylz,t1_f266svf,1570039271.0,"You can't ever say that based on one sentence, or even a few, even if you were a professional. But it's certainly manipulative and not OP's fault."
SuicideWatch,f1704iy,t1_f16deja,1569230904.0,"We know, that wasn't the point."
SuicideWatch,f16zrwi,t1_f16y8po,1569230554.0,Absolutely. I wish more people realized how so many physical conditions can have a direct effect on someone's mental state. Being aware of that is so important.
SuicideWatch,f13vmwc,t1_f1019b6,1569166032.0,This is awesome advice.
SuicideWatch,f13uw2v,t1_f00oqph,1569165659.0,I don't think it's true that no one cares. But it's true that not a lot of people actually do.
SuicideWatch,f13tk8n,t1_ezjnx4h,1569164994.0,"I agree with you. There are people that find pleasure in disturbing things, such as myself, but in any case, just like you said, they shouldn't engage in harmful behavior. That's unacceptable."
engrish,f0qqjw1,t3_d678od,1568864434.0,Isn't that just a typo?
engrish,f0qkm9a,t1_f0o5456,1568861454.0,"I see, thanks for the context."
discordapp,f0pwb1p,t1_f0ptb8q,1568849001.0,"I'm not OP and I wouldn't do something like that. I had this happen to me. Which is exactly why I wouldn't have a name that enables trolls/assholes like this again.
I would ask you not to jump to conclusions based on such a short comment."
discordapp,f0psp04,t1_f0ppgos,1568846449.0,"The title is a joke, and if you have the name ""don't ping me"" then you're just asking for it. Really, what did that person expect?"
discordapp,f0pshvx,t3_d6163f,1568846297.0,"Yes, just select the app window when you're screensharing. In my experience, the web browser won't work but video players should be fine. Just make sure you select the application window instead of ""entire screen"" so you have both privacy and audio."
deathnote,f0o58ah,t1_f0ahxsq,1568795983.0,"This made day, really glad I could help you."
engrish,f0o4w3l,t3_d5sshj,1568795388.0,That... might have been intentional. And it would make sense if it was.
neekomains,f067xcj,t1_f05lhzg,1568431481.0,I want in too!
neekomains,f06144f,t3_d3yivx,1568425801.0,I usually rush Zhonya's after GLP if I have to (I do a lot of the time).
relationship_advice,f05uu6i,t1_ezxoy03,1568420363.0,"It's a fact, I don't have to think it. I did give a reason why though.

relationship_advice,ezwdb0o,t1_ezwckvz,1568213997.0,Morality is subjective. Moral dilemmas wouldn't exist if it wasn't.
handholding,ezwbo51,t1_eyvpvei,1568212901.0,"Ah, I see. Thanks for the info."
discordapp,ezwb6bt,t1_ezw3y0p,1568212567.0,I didn't know that either. One workaround is to just have another unverified app running in the background and renaming it to Plasma Shell. I do that when it doesn't recognize my game or displays the title in a very unpleasant way (for example all caps for no reason).
handholding,eyv0mn7,t1_eyuhkri,1567477209.0,Wait her name is unironically White Snow? Damn.
AhriMains,eyt2bjq,t1_eyt2ar0,1567421631.0,I love this style!
AhriMains,eyt29pb,t3_cyld11,1567421557.0,"Wait there's another one, I actually love this so much. Will you finish the tails?"
AhriMains,eyt2544,t1_eyt1u5c,1567421381.0,"I edited it with my drawing to kind of give you an idea of what I'm talking about. I think drawing that line helps with the placement a lot. Of course, you're welcome!"
AhriMains,eyt1dc6,t3_cyhukv,1567420258.0,"Her eye on the left is a lot higher than it should be.

Other than that, I like it."
