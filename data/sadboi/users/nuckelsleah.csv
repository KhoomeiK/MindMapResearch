And if I don’t?  She starts sighing, then throws her head back and starts making an amazing range of tiny barks and groans.."

depression,ffcj8ww,t3_esv7w7,1579800636.0,"Just gonna say, I agree this world is messed up and it seems a catastrophe could happen any moment..

But don’t say you should not  have even been born, not true...  You have something that makes you special.  

Your mental health hell is a gift if you keep on trucking.  It might even be called your Super Power,,  

I know that sounds ridiculous but simply being born with a wonky head gives you an advantage. It allows you to have empathy for people in pain.  It opens you up to folks outside your tribe.  It also. gives you the capacity to love the unloved.

Sometimes I hate my wonky brain. 
Currently most of time I despise the bast***, but I know when I start feeling better I feel like a real bada** for surviving.

Worry about you, the worldship lollipop is always on the edge of destruction and yes, it’s getting worse, but you don’t have to go down with the ship(especially when you have no idea when  it’s going down).

Hope I make sense and don’t sound preachy.   But I have been in the pit countless times and have finally learned to help and love those who, like me, are gifted with wonky pain brains,,😘"
