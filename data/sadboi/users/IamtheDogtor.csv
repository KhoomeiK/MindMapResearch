While his roommates are making some big demands and are likely paranoid, you shouldn’t be so dismissive of their fears."
AutismTranslated,fp4l2ep,t1_fp44hzg,1588301404.0,No food texture aversions that I’m aware of! I guess that I’m just (ironically) afraid of unintentionally being an imposter in the autistic community. But everyone seems so understanding and supportive which is giving me hope that maybe I’ll be able to get to the bottom of my behaviors. Definitely think I’ll seek out a professional opinion (once the world is semi normal again).

AskWomen,foqtved,t1_fopxr9c,1588000737.0,I bought myself a little cold brew maker off amazon and was surprised how simple it is. The trick is remembering to set it up the night before haha
AskWomen,foploxu,t3_g8tam8,1587964859.0,Overnight oats and cold brew coffee! They’re simple ways for me to do something for future me to enjoy.
AskWomen,foplkxc,t3_g8rrkk,1587964771.0,Crackle wood wicks are by far my absolute favorite. I would usually get them on sale at home goods but seeing as the TJ Maxx online store isn’t even open ~sigh~
ChoosingBeggars,foobp8b,t3_g8cxj0,1587936154.0,"Lol people are ALWAYS looking for free handouts of advice from veterinarians and their staff. If you’re really so concerned about your animal, then schedule an actual appointment with your vet. The only question you should ever ask a veterinary friend should be along the lines of “do you think this sounds serious enough to warrant a trip to the vet, or do you think I can wait?” We legally can not give you a diagnosis or treatment plan without ever having seen the patient. People really suck."

depression,fonqwb0,t3_g8eq07,1587924707.0,"I could never presume to know your sadness but my heart hurts for you. I’m not a professional, all I could suggest is trying to find ways to honor her in your life. Make a scrapbook of all your favorite pictures with her, write a journal filled with all your favorite memories of her so that you will never forget. Brainstorm ideas of how you can honor her in the future and set goals of how you will achieve these (i.e. become qualified to teach women’s self defense classes). I know the memory of her will never replace her and won’t erase your pain, but refuse to let what those bastards did ruin her memory, she deserves better. 

Find something to channel your anger whether that’s by running, boxing, painting, literally anything to get it out. Do it until you’ve exhausted yourself and then when you feel like breaking down, let yourself. Grief is powerful, and everyone experiences it differently. I understand that right now it only feels as though you’re living for you parents’ sake, but you’ve got so much more to offer in your young life. Find one small thing that makes life worth living every day, write it down and read them every morning. 

Lastly, open up to the people around you. I understand it’s easier to bare your heart with anonymity, that there’s less at stake. You need their support though, whether you are ready to acknowledge it or not. If you struggle to find the words or saying it out loud makes you too uncomfortable, write them a letter not unlike the one you’ve written to us. I see your cry for help but there’s only so much I can say from behind a screen. I hope that you’ll soon find the help you need."

AmItheAsshole,foem5z9,t3_g72ody,1587707552.0,"NTA. Your wife clearly has unresolved childhood trauma that she needs to work on with a therapist. This in no way makes it ok for her to target your daughter like this. If she is concerned about her health, then speak to a pediatrician or nutritionist. Ask the daughter if there is some type of sport she would be interested in trying. Your wife is not doing your daughter any favors, even if she thinks she means well. Your daughter should likely see a therapist too since this has already started to alter her behavior and mental health."
childfree,foc4yz1,t1_foc3h4e,1587667165.0,"That is my exact fear. Perhaps I am influenced by the fact that I never saw a strong, involved father figure in my life or any of my friends’ lives. I could never imagine what it would be like to be trapped in a marriage that is no longer working because I need to “keep it together for the kids.” I want to have my own life that is MINE and not defined by motherhood. 

But glad to know that there are men out there, also very inspired by the fact that he takes responsibility for fielding those questions."
AmItheAsshole,fobsffj,t3_g6l1l5,1587663175.0,"YWBTA. Your child is at an age in her life where she might think that it is her fault that her grandmother doesn’t like her and that might set her up for a lifetime of issues. I wouldn’t lie or be too vague, because I’ve seen how lies can disrupt children’s mental health and cause them to regress (I used to work in early childcare). Instead, I would suggest telling her that you and grandma are in a disagreement, and that you’ve tried to work it out but grandma does not want to make nice. Reiterate that it is not your daughter’s fault, and allow her to express how she feels about her grandma. Maybe encourage her to draw out her feelings. Make it a teachable moment, tell her how grandma makes YOU feel since she is not being nice to you.
Then, tell grandma that if she expects to have contact with your new baby that she at least needs to be civil towards your daughter and acknowledge her existence. And your husband NEEDS to back you up on this. Tell him that “ignoring her” isn’t going to cut it and that you need his support in this for the well-being of both your children. Set expectations for what he needs to do in order to help you."
AmItheAsshole,fo7q7e9,t1_fo7bimu,1587582659.0,"Agreed, also you should look up cyber bullying laws in your state. At the very least you can take print outs of her twitter posts and the threats you’ve received on social media as result to your school."
AmItheAsshole,fo6y3mf,t1_fo6ko0h,1587568864.0,"Alright, but the OP has had the dog for a long time and this person knew moving in that the condition was if he didn’t want the dog getting into his stuff, he needed to keep the door closed. If this were an issue for him, he should have brought it up and asked for a different solution (like the ones you’ve listed). The roommate is NAH for forgetting to close the door, or even for not thinking to keep his chocolate out of reach. But he is the AH for demanding the roommate pay for the chocolate. You shrug off the amount of chocolate that the dog ate, but the OP stated it was a 1kg bag of chocolate and if it were just milk chocolate (60mg/oz methylxanthines) and not dark chocolate, that would make out to be about 2100mg methylxanthines (the toxic ingredients in chocolate). Let’s say Beau here is a nice 65lb (~30 kg). That’s 70mg/kg of methylxanthines (anything over 40 mg/kg is considered life threatening).   Also you have no idea if this dog has any preexisting conditions that could make this an even more life threatening situation. He was only trying to prove a point to his roommate of how stupid his demand was by saying he should help pay for the vet bill (he already stated that it never crossed his mind prior, so he was clearly willing to accept responsibility for his dog’s actions). OP is NAH."
AmItheAsshole,fo6tk04,t3_g5o7yp,1587566460.0,"NTA. As someone who works in the veterinary field, I applaud you for your responsible pet ownership. You set money aside in case of this exact scenario, and you have every right to use it in that manner. Maybe if you guys were talking about getting engaged and going over finances, then it would be a good time to discuss what savings you have put aside for what purposes. However, for her to presume that you should take that money to spend on your relationship instead is very rude and self-serving. I would tell her that though you understand that she’s having a difficult time and you are doing your best to empathize and show compassion (letting her move in is a big move and a money saver for her), that you’ve been saving up the money so that if a situation like this arose you’d be able to pay for it, and for her to ask you not to save your pets life is very unfair."
