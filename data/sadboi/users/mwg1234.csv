Nor do we look down at rural America.  If anything, we feel bad for them because they keep voting against their own interests.  Sure, they make small wins for ""conservative judges"" to protect gun rights and the futile hope of outlawing abortion.  But those same judges approve mergers that cost jobs, laws that pollute the environment and hurt your land, and legalize business practices that crush small farms.

Other opportunities expect me to upend my entire life and risk losing my apartment for a ""maybe."" I can't do something like that without some vague idea of when I can expect to get to a place where I am financially stable.

Honestly, I just want to be held to the same standard as everyone else.  Other people can SOMEHOW get a human being to look at their resume.  Why can't I?  Why should I be walked over by recruiters with a good sales pitch and an empty promise when I did just as good a job and worked just as hard as everyone else?

What can I do to get that ""lucky""?  I've paid my dues, worked hard and watched everyone get the jobs that I want because they were ""lucky."". Or they ""talked to the right people.""

And I STILL can't get a career job.  In ANY field.  My job barely pays me enough to live on my own, much less save for retirement or even travel.

Any advice I get means completely upending my life for a ""maybe,"" which, based on past experience blows up in my face.

People practically scream at me to NETWORK!  NETWORK!  NETWORK!  But when I ask where you go or who to talk to, they say: Idk.

Or: That first job is all important but impossible to get. And I have no idea how I got mine.  It fell into my lap because I was in the right place at the right time.

At this point, I don't care what the hell I do. As long as I can make a career out of it.  I really will do anything.

What I CAN'T do is work hard, upend my life and give up my health insurance for some vague ""maybe."" I am tired of firing off dozens of applications, taking classes, and asking for help only to watch everyone else get picked for a job because they were in the right place at the right time or they had the charisma of Will Smith.

I am fucking tired of being trapped in the ""you need experience to get experience"" loop.  EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO GET AROUND IT BUT ME!  I HAVE BEEN STUCK IN IT FOR 10 YEARS, AND NO ONE WILL HELP.

I am trapped in a goddamn catch 22, willing to do anything but keep getting the short end of the stick.

Internship?  Fine.  I work for my dad.  I'd intern in the afternoon for free.  Who will let me?  I don't know.

Volunteer?  Same answer.

What do I have to do to get a human being to look at my resume instead of it being deleted because it doesn't have the right keywords in a job description written by clueless headhunters who don't know anything about the job?  Camp out in their office?  Communicate in semaphore?  ESP?

I'm fed up with the circular logic, non answers, and cliquisness."
