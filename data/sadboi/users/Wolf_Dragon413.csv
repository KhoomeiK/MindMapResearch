depression,fcn9b80,t3_ei3sg1,1577806574.0,"You're not pathetic. Depression and anxiety/panic disorder can be very debilitating conditions. Try not to put yourself down because of whether or not other people wouldn't think you deserve to be depressed. It doesn't work that way, your pain is real and you matter. I suffer from the same problem, so much so that I lost my job. Maybe you should try some volunteer work, tutoring or something that gives you the sense that you are make a difference even if it's something small and just to occupy your time with."

depression,fap9zzw,t3_eacjlp,1576283692.0,"I completely understand, I go through the same thing. The best thing to do is to seek professional help for methods that can help manage the overwhelming feeling better.

depression,f8v1hbv,t3_e2e9e6,1574855591.0,"Unfortunately, some therapist don't think before they speak. I'd give them the benefit of the doubt that they didn't mean it to come out so rude. Going at a slow pace is still YOUR pace and the all that matters is that you are making progress. It's not their place to pass judgement on your speed because it is not to their liking, especially with someone with severe depression. You are doing your best and that's all that matters. 

If anything they should be offering extra elements and treatments that can help along side your therapy sessions."

depression,f8uzsvh,t1_f8uzhiu,1574853258.0,"Yeah, CBT and DBT definitely sounds like what I need in a therapist. I need methods that help beyond the basic stuff. I just wish they would stop leaving me. At least refer me to someone else before you go, you know? I feel like I deserve at least that much. I know that I should just look for someone else, but it's just so discouraging."
depression,f8uzcdu,t1_f8uylyh,1574852556.0,"Well, before this current therapist I hadn't been to a therapist in about three years. This was partly due to my fear of my therapist ditching me because I was too broken and due to financial issues and lack of insurance. So, far all my therapist were pretty basic. They didn't really offer any helpful means of dealing with my depression and anxiety. They would just say basic things like ""do these breathing exercises"" and ""talking about what's going on"", but nothing beyond that."
depression,f8alv1k,t3_dzrohs,1574401466.0,I also do this all the time to try and help myself feel better or distract myself while in one of my episodes. Your not alone.

depression,f5x4bb8,t1_f5x1a75,1572535174.0,"Yeah, depression is terrible. Keep telling myself that it will get better or at least I will. And sometimes it doesn't feel that way, like I'm going around in a circle. I know I have to keep trying, and it helps to know that I'm not alone."
depression,f5x22h3,t1_f5x0plp,1572534205.0,Thanks. *Hugs*

I'm going to do my best, all I want is to make the right decisions."
depression,f5x00gb,t1_f5wz2wj,1572533297.0,Thanks. I rather not say what my job is (makes me feel self-conscious). It's not hard (especially in other people's eyes) but I can't seem to stop making mistakes and being an annoyance to my co-workers. I'm really trying but I just can't seem to do anything right.
depression,f54tnxq,t3_dmrxim,1571991628.0,I definitely feel like that too. I have to avoid social media because seeing everyone's progress makes my depression worse.

depression,f470n3h,t1_f470jcu,1571415923.0,Thank you for trying to help me though.
depression,f470jcu,t1_f45q24o,1571415888.0,I wish that was true. The real reality is that you have to pretend to be fine. And anything suggesting otherwise is an inconvenience to everyone. The reasonable amount of time has already passed and I still this way. Everyone else has it together but I can seem to.
