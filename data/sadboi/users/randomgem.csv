I was in second year, college. Nursing here in the Philippines. Our family is in the middle class, I have a younger brother, one age gap.. meaning he'll be in college too.. Our family can only sustain one so they decided to go with my brother because my aunt decided to help us out. She funded my studies. My dad, was a high school graduate. He wasnt able to finish studies..

I messed up, I had a baby. I decided to go with it. I stopped college..

A few months before my delivery, he did it. He hanged himself with a rope but he put a towel in between the rope and his neck so it wouldnt mark... in our living room.. left a note, said he was sorry and he cant do it no more.. he thinks that nobody will help me out since I am a woman with a baby that has no husband. That I will end up like him, underhraduate. That I have no future.. since we are strangers here I am honest but everytime they will ask our family about it, we will tell him he just died of heart attack and we just found him lying on the floor..we denied autopsy.

I fucked up..
