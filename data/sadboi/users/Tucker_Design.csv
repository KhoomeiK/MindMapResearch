That being said, if you do continue making videos, consider condensing information down to a more essential form. For example, at the start of the video, you discuss the sloop itself. This section could easily lose 40-60 seconds. The reason it’s more important to keep information like this concise is to keep a viewer interested. Drawing out subjects early on can make it easier to dismiss. Leave detailed explanations to specific strategies and techs."
Seaofthieves,fq5iyxc,t1_fq5hu18,1589107225.0,"Look, you’ve spelled it out. It’s clear that you don’t get harassed to the point you are describing, again you’ve just fallen into the bank of *’keep lying to the point I’ve dug the hole so deep it’s unrealistic to be questioned’*. This is very common practice for low entry debaters. 

I play this game a lot, I’m an Athena 10 PL and I’ve seen a bunch of shit. I’ve had my solo sloop stuck between two galleons. I’ve had Chest of Legends stolen by a tucker. I’ve had people wait at an outpost, fill it with gunpowder and nuke the island as we unload the loot. But this is not the majority of sessions. Most people go about their own business, and only PvP if they feel threatened or instigated.

I myself, am a PvPer. I will engage just about anybody if the mood strikes me. I will sit in your boat as it fills with water, killing you as you spawn until your ship has sunk. This is the most effective way of securing a kill. For two years, I had nothing to show for that. But now, with the ability to sell a broken flag, I have a purpose to engage players beyond the reward of PvP. 

But I’ve done the PvE grind. I’ve done 20 captain Order of Souls voyages, I’ve been stuck on riddles at Old Faithful and I’ve carried fucking pigs all the way to the outpost only for them to die as I arrive. It sucks when you lose that loot. It sucks when a team pursues a kill. 

But you’ve got to see it from the other side. The rush of beating another crew is a PvP fox I can’t find in any other game. 99% of the time, people who PvP are looking to win, not grief. Being spawn camped sucks. Being tucked sucks. But that’s part of the experience. Sure, I relish the day I kill a galleon running a gilded Athena. But most of the time I’m looking for a good fight. Some of those are wins, but some are losses. 

You can’t go into this game expecting everyone to bend to your will. The game is about surprise, survival and endurance. Your crew lives and breathes by or ability to act, think and communicate. 

The game is designed to play the way you want. But there are rules that restrict you. Those restrictions are there to create a level playing field for everyone. If you consistently find yourself being beaten by other players, then I’m sorry but, **you are the problem**. 

You need to take the time to learn the game. Even if, hypothetically, you are being briefed every single time you play, it’s nobody’s fault other than yours that you get pushed into those situations. Take some time to learn basic defensive strats, like watching ladders, keeping the horizon checked and improving your mechanical skill. 

The game gives you two options. Adapt, or leave. The choice is yours. Stop pretending that everyone else it’s at fault. You need to make a decision, adjust to the reality, or move onto something else."
Seaofthieves,fq5h87q,t3_ggyfvb,1589105315.0,"I’m going to break this down into two parts.

**Part 1 - Over exaggerating for effect**

You see this everywhere right. So, greifing is a term that means a lot of different things to different people. To me, greifing is purposefully trying to manipulate the fun of somebody else’s session. To you, greifing is being engaged in PvP. You are entitled to your opinion as to what it constitutes, though much of the community will disagree with you. The problem lies in the details. Do I truly believe that every Single PvP encounter you find yourself in is excessively manipulated? No. You’ve gone for the furthest possible description to sensationalise your point. In the comments you’ve done the same. We all know people moan about PvP in this game on a regular basis, but you go ahead and deny that to a point which borders on ridiculous. My point being, you are lying to promote a dishonest rhetoric. If you want your voice to be heard on the nature of PvP centric players, this is not the way to do it. 

**Part 2 - Without bloodthirsty players Sea of Thieves isn’t unique**

I get it. Just last week, I lost 30-40k gold from being absolutely destroyed by a crew. It sucks, nobody likes having their stuff taken away. But, that’s part of the game. I like being cautious, constantly on watch and having to think. Aggressive crews are what separates this game from anything else. The meme is an absolute dead horse, but sea of friends would suck. I like being challenged with the element of danger being possible at any given moment. If you want an easy game, that doesn’t challenge you or make you think, this isn’t the game for you, pure and simple."

Seaofthieves,fpuzq8l,t3_gfddnr,1588929588.0,"This is my thing right. Sure, this post is kind of right, but there’s a big problem. **Its almost impossible to know who is new and who isn’t**. Some people cite noobs ship livery and sails, but 1/2 the time I’ll roll out forgetting to customise and I’m going to bet a bunch of people do the same. 

At the end of the day, some people play solely for the rush of PvP. I myself find way more satisfaction in selling stolen loot and defeating player crews. Sure, if I sink a tall tale; I’ll sacrifice my rowboat and place their quest items in it where we sunk them. If I see players that are 100% greenhorns, I’ll hold off. 

The counter to all this though is people need to learn the experience. I can imagine, being spawn killed right out the gate will suck as a first time playing the game. But, these things happen in SoT. Part of the unique appeal of the game, *atleast for me*, is that I’m always on my toes, I never trust anyone, any time I’m doing anything I’m constantly thinking and considering the possibilities and consequences. I’ve built this up from learning the game and the time I’ve spent around other players. It’s the driving force that keeps me playing."
