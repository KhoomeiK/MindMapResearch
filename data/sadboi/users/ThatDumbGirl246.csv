travel,fib297l,t3_f7fx3q,1582313135.0,"For Mom who travels by car:
Make sure the bag is not so big so that she is able to lift it when full to take the bag in and out of the car. Look for reinforced edges and corners.  Look for a zipper that is reinforced and not a light weight plastic that will break. Another good thing is a handle that is strong enough that it wont break off easily.  If you choose bags with wheels then check that they can be replaced when they wear out. Some bags use standard rollerblade  wheels which can be switched out when they wear thin. 

Car travel bags can be softer sided than other types of travel. Softer bags will accommodate the confines of the vehicle better than rigid bags will. 

A packing system of smaller compression bags will help keep her items sorted so packing and laundry is easier. We use the packing cubes by Amazon basics to organize everything from shoes to electronics:
Amazon Basics travel organizer
[Amazon Basics travel organizer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014VBHEFW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_f4cuEb1BM9CB8) 

Look also for how she plans to store the bags when she is not traveling. For example, can they all fit inside one large bag and be stored away without taking up a big part of her closet?

We use Briggs and Riley luggage for air travel because of the lifetime guarantee but if it’s not for plane travel then you can find other brands that will last a long time too. 

And finally, this is not luggage but you may also Encourage your mother to take lots of photos with her cell phone and show her how to upload them onto a free sharing platform like google photo so you can continue to encourage her  adventures. 

Best wishes."

Taking on a strict change is difficult to sustain.

Low energy may be from too few calories. 

Dropping flour and dairy and carbs from your diet will help you lose weight initially, but as soon as you eat some again (ie bread) the weight will come back. 

Adding salt will burden your heart and if you are already out of shape this is unwise.

Find a friend who needs to lose weight and buddy up for accountability.
