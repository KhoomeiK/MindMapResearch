Eventually we started to buy calling cards and would talk for hours on the phone. We would also mail letters back and forth. I ended up meeting him once on a trip I took cross country with my uncle. It was awkward and cute all at once. We just sort of stopped talking to each other one day after that but at times I still wonder what he‚Äôs up to. I also still have the stack of letters he sent me. üôÉ"

noburp,f9rjlc7,t3_e6hbfi,1575577242.0,Something similar happened to me just the other day and I contemplated an ER or urgent care visit. I was grocery shopping and all of a sudden out of nowhere had this intense sharp pain around my diaphragm and got very dizzy and sweaty. Ended up going to my car to lay down for a bit and felt mostly better after that. If I hadn‚Äôt gone to lay down I‚Äôm sure I would have fainted (have fainted before from situations like this). Good luck with everything and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre feeling better!

AmItheAsshole,f40pij3,t3_dizqin,1571304473.0,"NTA, but I think you should really talk with your SIL first. She needs to be a part of that conversation with the kids. The children need to know he has died and at their ages it shouldn‚Äôt be traumatizing, kids are super resilient. What is traumatizing however is allowing them to call you by any form of ‚Äúdad‚Äù when you are not in fact their father. I would try to have the conversation with your SIL and the kids ASAP before they start to remember this. I lost my dad when I was 5 and my sister was 2, and can guarantee you that I don‚Äôt remember this conversation at all, only tiny fragments of my father and his funeral. It was not traumatizing, more so just a fact of life that he had died."

AmItheAsshole,f2zm3w7,t1_f2yt5xq,1570529597.0,"Doctors do not always know best. Obesity does not mean unhealthy. It is merely a word used to describe a certain BMI. A person can be healthy (exercise, eat a balanced meal, sleep well, have good relationships, etc) and still be obese. I recommend you not focus on her weight and instead focus on living a healthy lifestyle. If she needs money to maintain a healthy lifestyle, go ahead and offer that. But please don‚Äôt incentivize losing weight, ever."
AmItheAsshole,f2zlg3d,t3_deoeup,1570528598.0,"YTA. 100%. Why is everyone‚Äôs consensus here nah?! Your daughter is at an extremely stressful time in her life (I imagine because as you‚Äôve said, she has no time for anything but school and work) and you‚Äôre focusing on her weight?! Just about everything in our diet crazed society right now already puts pressure on young men and women to be a certain weight or body type, why add to it? I get if you are concerned about her health and want her to be able to work out, but her weight or body shape/size should NOT be the reason to exercise. In fact, don‚Äôt focus on her weight at all, that should be none of your concern. Paying your daughter to lose weight is just a recipe for developing an eating disorder. Eating disorders are super common with this type of thinking, especially in college aged women. I‚Äôve seen this hundreds of times working with women and men suffering from this extremely deadly disorder. Please for the sake of your daughter, do not do this!"
