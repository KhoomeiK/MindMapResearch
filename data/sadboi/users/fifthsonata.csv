Do this at your own discretion - about 99% of the time it’s been fine, but since I can’t see your horn I have to make the disclaimer. 

Do you have a lyre and an elastic neck strap? If so, attach it and turn it around facing you. Then hook the neck strap somewhere on the lyre. You can reinstall the thumb rest using the solitary screw, because at this point it *should* just provide you with stability if the elastic neck strap is bearing the weight. The risk you run is the other screw breaking out if the neck strap isn’t bearing the weight. 

Your other option is to just stand and rest it on a table of appropriate height. 


I wouldn’t recommend messing with the hole much, because the integrity of the wood may be compromised and you could cause further damage. Hopefully it’s just stripped and that’s all, but better safe than sorry. Please please don’t use tape - any tape capable of bearing weight will have strong adhesive, and that can damage the wood.

I’m sorry. If you have poor tone holes, a soft bladder (woven felt) is often the best choice to make up for those imperfections. 

Once you get the pad face level, I’d recommend cork or Masters pads for the upper and the Roopads on the lower (I personally have Masters throughout my entire clarinet, but most players I do work for love the combo).

Clarinet,fqk9utj,t3_gi4rst,1589422955.0,"Woodwind tech here. 

It could be a number of things. Run down the list and experiment. I’ll give you my initial suspicions. 

1) Make sure the pad thickness is providing appropriate venting. 

2) Not all pads are perfect and one pad may have loose skin. This can cause vibrating. 

You can fix this by ironing the pad face. Using a needle oiler or similar, add a few drops of water to the pad face and spread it around. Heat up a clean metal surface to where it is ALMOST too hot to touch. Run the metal piece (I use a pad slick) over the face. It should not steam with contact or you risk shrinking the skin too much too fast and it tears. 

3) Did you prick the pad with a tiny needle to allow pressure to escape as you heated the pad in the cup? If not, this can also create loose skin. These pads are usually evident and will have a dome shape where the pad face meets the tone hole or the skin will be excessively wrinkly. With a domed pad, there is no salvaging and you will need to start again.


Also, remember that cigarette paper or Teflon feeler gage checks are not fool-proof. Your finger pressure can give false readings. If you want to be 100% certain, check with a magnehelic. It’s infuriatingly accurate."

From the get go, my partner and I wanted to share feedings. There is no cut & dry way to do it, honestly, so I’ll just share with you what we found to be best for our LO.

We bought a small assortment of bottles to see which one she preferred. For the first two weeks, we were heavy on the breastfeeding so she would better learn how to latch, and tried out different bottles 2-3 times a day. 

The bottle choices should depend on *your* nipple shape, which is weird to sit there at the store and stare at nipples, but it absolutely worked in helping her latch to bottles. Mine preferred the Avent natural flow. 

I suggest you get slow flow and anti-colic options in whatever brand you choose, and check the website of that company! Avent sent us samples when I signed up for mailers and that saved us some cash.

When she got the hang of latching, we would go every other feeding - so if I fed her at 9, dad would feed her at 11. I would still pump every hour to ensure my flow was adequate. 

At night, dad and I alternated 4 hour shifts so we’d each get 4 hours uninterrupted (unless she puked and we needed help cleaning up). 

Now, my experience then changed - she had really bad colic. I altered my diet to avoid triggers, and it still didn’t work. We tried an allergy formula, and it was a night and day difference. This was around month 3. We stuck with the allergy formula and I stopped breastfeeding. 

(I did, however, pump when I was full. My supply naturally started to dwindle, so I pumped and would give her little booby shots mixed in with her formula, lol. Took about a month for my supply to stop.) 

The only thing I recommend is to make sure you pump often if she’s not latching with every feed to make sure your flow stays solid. 



Good luck, and I hope you get lots of good ideas!


OH - you should know that nipple sizes change on bottles! We were dumb and didn’t know they went past slow flow and size 2. Slow flow is for newborns, size 2 is for roughly 2-3mos, size 3 is for 3mos, and size 4 is for 6mos."

I would suggest sitting down and talking about mutual wants. You don’t have to bring in a 3rd to spice things up (unless you want that). 

You can start small. For example, if you notice in his porn that he watches a lot of women in heels and thigh highs, try surprising him with that. 

You could also go to a sex shop and experiment with toys and/or apparel. Don’t be shy and ask a clerk for help - they’ll be knowledgeable and happy to assist. 

Other ways to spice it up could include role playing and kink, if you’re willing to experiment in that realm. 


Also - don’t hesitate to ask him some things you’d like to try. A lot of men simply enjoy a woman asking for what she wants. Maybe one night you go domme on him and play a little that way. 

So....have a chat. You could have fun and make a sex-periment list."

I wanted to stay home with her. Life doesn’t always work out that way and we both work. Now, I’ve had the pleasure of watching her learn how to crawl. Hearing her words begin to form as she exclaims “DAD” all the time. Watching her giggle with glee as she figured out she could stand, and laughing our asses off as she chases the old grumpy cat around the house. 

We have no idea why she picks the cat when there’s a dog who wants to play, but she laughs hysterically when that old cat meows or even looks at her. 

Learning to navigate a new part of our relationship as a couple and as parents has been difficult and beautiful all at the same time. 

Life cheats you out of this time; when they’re young and exploring the world. She’ll probably take her first steps at daycare when we all have to go back and it breaks my heart. 

But, I will forever cherish this time. If there’s anything we should all learn is that life is too, too short. So many people have died from this virus, and we owe it to them to cherish the life we still have.

In addition, finger pressure can compensate for leaking pads. It’s why techs rely on machines called magnehelics - these allow us to test vacuum pressure. Flaws in tone holes, and even incredibly minor gaps in a pad seat can cause it to leak like a sieve and cause resistant playing. 

So what that means is these small gaps can give you false readings when doing vacuum checks by hand."

Typically issues with resistance are caused by leaks and/or regulation issues, but remember that leaks can be caused by more than just where the pad hits the tone hole. 


Your best bet is to go see your tech again when you are able. They can work with you, hopefully use a mag machine (this can find leaks better than a human!), and get it back to that nice buttery feel. Cracks, mouthpiece condition, reeds - they all play a role as well. 

Side note - I see that your F/C and E/B are not parallel (F/C looks low), so regulation might be an issue. It could be the angle of the photo, but seeing this would make me check regulation and pad sealing."

I’m a few hours from NYC but I’d love to work on this, lol. If you’re still looking, message me and I’ll put out a call to my colleagues to see who’s in your area. 

Crack repair and mechanical restoration is possible. I can’t give you an estimate without seeing the clarinet, but I can tell you this will be based on time rather than job (example - I would charge an hour’s labor to do a basic adjustment, but $20 to replace a tenon cork). 

I’d be more reticent on crack repair for old clarinets such as this one. The wood would need to be treated first to ensure it didn’t crumble the moment I started pinning or banding the wood (depending on severity and location). 

Selling this clarinet - you’d have the best success with collectors in North America. We traditionally play Boehm systems. Klezmer groups tend to use Albert systems, but they’re not common here. You’d have better luck selling overseas. 

Personally, unless you’re going to play it yourself, I’d recommend you sell it as-is and let someone else pay for the repairs. 

Again, if you want help finding a tech near you, PM me. If no one is near you, I’m 4-5 hours from Montreal across the border."

No, it should not be more resistant. 

As another person mentioned - it’s most likely the venting was not adequate with the Valentinos. The stock Buffet pads match the factory specs, but they’re likely not sealing correctly. 

Do a vacuum test on each joint with very light finger pressure. Take the upper joint, place your left hand to cover the tone holes with gentle finger pressure (just enough to seal). Put your mouth on the upper tenon like you’re about to buzz into it, then put the palm of your right hand against the lower tenon. Suck in so that you create a vacuum - you should feel your palm pull in with your lips and you suck air out of the joint. It should hold pressure for at LEAST 3 seconds. 

Do the same with the bottom joint. 


My suggestion is to go back to your tech and tell them what’s going on. I suspect they use a heavier hand to play than you do, which is why it feels resistant (meaning they press harder, which can overcompensate for leaks)."
