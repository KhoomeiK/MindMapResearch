depression,f9et36n,t3_e4r3d5,1575250850.0,I'm terribly sorry you had to go through all of that. Nobody should never have to be made to feel like there feelings are invalidated. Your feelings matter like everyone elses. If you ever need someone to talk to or vent to I'm here. I mean it.
depression,f9esdl7,t3_e4r5uh,1575250312.0,I'm up for chatting if you'd like :)

depression,f8krl71,t3_e0xhl4,1574614468.0,No one should ever feel ashamed about having depression or be forced to hide it. I'm sorry you're going through this. Sometimes we need to just vent to get emotions out. Also I hate when people say someone shouldn't be depressed because they have nothing to be depressed about. Thats bullshit because that person who said that has no idea what's going on in that person's head. Someone doesnt have to be going through bad times to have their depression validated. Our own minds are usually the worst places to be. Hugs.
depression,f8fllj9,t3_e0l6oi,1574545624.0,Definitely
depression,f7wq3fh,t3_dxuizw,1574036227.0,I definitely feel this way and I also believe perseverance doesnt always lead to success.

depression,f7wp82p,t3_dxusz2,1574035923.0,If anything that was a rude thing to say. Just because people in the world may be in worse situations doesn't make your feelings any less valid. People who doesnt have depression seriously dont get it.
depression,f6unkmt,t3_dt55g1,1573165352.0,She sounds very rude for saying that. I'm sorry :(

depression,f6frhm9,t3_dr76zy,1572817267.0,Yes. I've been told in the past I talked someone's ear off after they told me I could vent to them. And I'm always scared people are talking about me and secretly hate me.
depression,f6fmjcc,t3_dr6nt2,1572815935.0,I can talk
depression,f6e27ty,t3_dqzott,1572799408.0,I agree. It's only when they randomly remember you that they say I miss you.

depression,es2h0yb,t3_c5l0fq,1561524108.0,I think its normal to feel smothered when you have depression and the one youre with doesnt give you the space you need. Some of us need more space than others and not everyone gets that. Im 31 and have had depression since about 11 or 12 and it can be very debilitating. Just wanted to convey that I know how it feels.
