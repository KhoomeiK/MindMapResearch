JusticeServed,fnxo59n,t1_fnxnks2,1587342758.0,"Yeah i see what you mean. But wouldnt it be more effective to punish the copycats and others they can identify with a 2 year punishment. I dont think punishing ine for 20 years will stop people completely. But if people saw that simoly licking someones icecream will give them 2 years or atleast some type of punishment i think alot of people would quickly stop. Like if they saw ""only one person has got caught and ounished severely i have more chance of not getting caught"". Compared to ""everyone who has done this has caught some type of punishment, i wont because im more likely to get punished"""
JusticeServed,fnxndut,t1_fnxn7zf,1587342297.0,Oh wait no i think we misunderstood each other. Im talking about those who were saying to punish her fir the full 20 if not more. 2 years may be alot but its not like she doesnt deserve it. I was more arguing to the people saying she needed 20.
JusticeServed,fnxn537,t1_fnxmi4t,1587342148.0,Yeah i think your comment hits the nail on the head. Yeah what she did sucks but in a court the sentence must be appropriate for their actions and other factors that have influenced them. Kinda like how someone insane doesnt get prison time because of their unique situation. I feel like people think im justifying her im not at all i believe she deserves punishment but to those who think she needs 20 years to punish her it wont do anything but make her rebel and hate society more.
JusticeServed,fnxmvtd,t1_fnxmeg2,1587341987.0,Look i know that. I definetly think she knew what she was doing wrong but she still has a potential to learn. And if she does not want to take that oppurtunity i believe that she deserves the punishment.
JusticeServed,fnxma2k,t1_fnxluoo,1587341612.0,It does in most cases but if someone really wanted to murder someone whether it be revenge or something sometimes they simply dont care for the punishment. It isnt 100% effective.
JusticeServed,fnxm195,t1_fnxlmoj,1587341463.0,Well in my opinion with age comes experience? I think thats universally a known fact. Yeah she is dumb and bloody stupid but a 40 year old will most likely know better than a 15-18 yr old. Therefore a 40 year old is more likely to know the full consequences of tampering with someones food therefore they knew and had intent to cause those effects. Someone younger may just not know better. Give them a chance to grow and better themselves.
JusticeServed,fnxljq5,t1_fnxlfap,1587341163.0,STOP COMPARING MURDER TO LICKING FUCKING ICECREAM. Yes its bad but i dount she is actively trying to take someones life. Is it beyond reasonable doubt that she wanted to kill someone?
JusticeServed,fnxle2h,t1_fnxl3hi,1587341066.0,"Dude no, no no no. I dont think you understand. She may have not had an intent to actually kill so until then its unfair and unjust to assume she did. However if someone gets a gun and shoots someone in the head im 99% sure they had intent to kill. If someone grabbed a knife and slit someones throat 99.99% sure they had intent to kill. Murdering is different to licking icecream you actual unsharpened knife"
JusticeServed,fnxl6ei,t1_fnxkxq5,1587340935.0,Thats all well in theory but in fact it will not stop them. No one thinks of getting caught when doing something. The copycats should also all be punished accordingly to their situation. Not treat one as all
JusticeServed,fnxkvoh,t1_fnxkica,1587340754.0,Yes but being young gives her a chance to learn and grow and maybe she will realise how such small action can have a big impact. Ultimately making society a better place. However a 40 year old most likely already has their morals and beliefs set. Being young isnt an excuse at all but you have to realise that there is potential to help her rather than ruin her. Helping one can in effect help others as who knows maybe she becomes an activist.
JusticeServed,fnxkh3x,t1_fnxjvqh,1587340511.0,"Yeah i agree with alot of your points here, food tampering is a fucking shit thing to do regardless of age. However you have to think of her situation as an individual one. She can potentially learn and become a better person, rather than having her life ultimately ruined. However i believe if she was given the chance ti learn and improve from her past mistakes and did not and continued to act in these ways then she deserves the more harsh punishment."
JusticeServed,fnxjp6s,t1_fnxiyzs,1587340052.0,"Yeah look sharing the video is definetly a huge factor and she should be punished for it but i think she is just young. Im thinking if she is young she would have had the thought process of ""im going to get someone sick and it probably wont be bad i am surviving being sick and i have seen others get well after being sick"". Its a bit fucked of her to have those intentions but i doubt her though process was ""im gonna lick this icecream get famous and inspire a bunch of others to do this so i can actually cause the death of innocent people"""
JusticeServed,fnxj1cq,t1_fnxidam,1587339652.0,"No i doubt she will get the 20 also im more addressing the people that say she deserves the full 20. The court of course isnt going to punish someone for 20 years over that, uts the people saying she should be punished for 20 years. A whole life ruined and a system and society that hates her for the rest of her life because she licked some icecream?"
JusticeServed,fnxit91,t1_fnxidvu,1587339517.0,"I understand she did spawn copycats but that is the copycats fault they should know better not to do it. Im sure she deserves punishment for it but she didnt actively do it to kill someone. She is just young and dumb and im sure she would learn her lesson with a lesser punishment. I suppose it draws the line tho because she was sick and she did put someone else at risk which is totally wrong, i doubt she did it with knowledge of how far it would spread and actually thinking about her actions."
JusticeServed,fnxif72,t1_fnxi3d8,1587339282.0,"Yeah thats a terrible thing that happened but is licking someones icecream the same. That person actually had an intent to kill, i have read that she knew she was sick and did have the potential to kill but she is young and probably didnt think that far ahead. She does need to be taught a lesson and definetly face consequences for her idiotic actions but licking 1 icecream and actually killing people are 2 different things. Still tho im not trying to downplay what she did she does deserve to be punished."
JusticeServed,fnxhzq6,t3_g47vlu,1587339027.0,"Ok yes this is a fucking shit thing to do but you lot are fucking crazy. Imagine 20 years for something like that? Does she really need 20 years to think about how shit it is to tamper with others food. For fucks sake this society is so backwards. If at most 1 year and some community service and a fine and i doubt she would ever lick anotger icecream tub or anything ever again in her life. She may have started the trend and it was a shitty thing to do but fuck if i lived in a world where i got 20 years for licking fucking icecream we would be getting 40 years for going 5km over the speed limit.


Edit: im not justifying her actions guys i believe whole heartedly she deserves to be punished but a couple months and maybe a community correction order and a heft fine would sort her out. If she does it again hell go for the 20 years."

I think op needs to realise most people are thanking and appluading them for risking their livliehood so food can still be distributed. Like before this you were a cashier doing your job to earn your way which does 100% deserve respect but not a thank you every single encounter, now they are litterally risking themselves and their families livliehoods to provide for others thats where the thank you is coming from.
