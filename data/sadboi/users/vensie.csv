Even things that go wrong or are less than ideal can be okay sometimes because there’s a familiar rhythm to life. No matter where I travel in the world and find home I can experience that to an extent and it feels like a privilege.

Like 5-10 minutes every few days makes a huge difference if that’s all you’re able to start with. When I’m tired or if I’m out of shape with abs and stuff then I’ll pop a small cushion under my head to support my neck for some ab exercises which ensures I’m using the right muscles.

Arts and crafts are a love of mine in general, and include a lifetime of charcoal drawing, a few years of knitting, and more recently embroidery. 

I have a passion for animal welfare and I’m great with felines, so I’m a specialist adult cat and kitten volunteer at my local shelter.

As with some ladies above, I am particularly good at spatial reasoning and really enjoy interior design for this reason. No measuring tools needed (other than me)!
