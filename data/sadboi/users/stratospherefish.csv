It's a zen game, where there's no fighting or levelling or end-goals, just calming, gradual growth and progression, as you work on whatever you'd like to do - befriending the villagers, completing your bug/fish collections, upgrading and decorating your house, et cetera. 

What makes it special is how well it nails the calming and wholesome atmosphere. The style and the music are very praiseworthy in particular. It's popular because it's a really wholesome, relaxing, and calming game to play. At least, that's what I've always gotten out of the series.

Why I defend them, though, is when you really watch the prequels as compared to the sequels, it becomes clear how much of the universe the prequels contributed - to what was, originally (blasphemy, I know) a fairly generic good-guys-versus-bad-guys space opera without a LOT of universe-building.

Yes, the original trilogy is better, and why we have Star Wars, but to me, the prequels lend so much more creative sci fi world building, alien races/cultures/planets, backstory, lore... 

We just wouldn't have the Star Wars universe we know and love, if the prequels weren't a thing.

Where I live we get scores and scores of the common little brown moths in stairwells and outside windows, and this one is practically identical to those except for... the horns? The things sticking out of the back of its head are doing so at upward forward angles, as is kinda evidenced by the shadows in the pic. They sort of appear to be tubes made of extra wing material or something, and, weirdly, they seem to disappear when he flies, which he can definitely do.

First playthrough, there's this nice Altmer who runs the stables outside Windhelm. His name's [Ulundil.](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ulundil)

One of his dialogue options involves dragons; you can ask him if he's worried, to which he'll reply ""My pa used to say there ain't no use worryin' about the things you can't change. If it's my fate to be ended by a dragon, so be it. Meantime, I'll live my life the way I want to.""

...You can probably tell where this is going, but I swear to god, the INSTANT this boy stopped talking, a dragon glitched into existence over Windhelm, and let loose a column of fire that ended Ulundil's fucking existence. From my vantage point, he stops speaking and then bursts into flame.He remains dead on my first/main character's game, and *what* a way to go.

RIP Ulundil.

minimalism,f7u1qxc,t3_dxao8e,1574009694.0,"This is one of the biggest reasons I, personally, just finalised my switch to digital/wacom. 

I always used to draw traditionally, but a few years back I got a wacom tablet and have been using it ever since, but kept a ton of pens, pencils, sketchpads etc ""in case"" I wanted to do something traditionally again. After realising all that stuff barely ever got used, and when I needed to move apartments a few weeks ago, I gave going traditional one last try.   
I ended up really just re-realising that the reason I moved to digital in the first place was wide range of colour selections (I've designed a lot of non-white characters and characters who have really crazy colours, and I just don't have their exact colours in pens/pencils) and the ability to manipulate and redo art instead of having to start over from scratch (I was NOT willing to surrender the undo button, the rotate button, and mesh transform). Even the things I DID draw traditionally, I was finishing digitally.... et cetera. 

So I pretty much bit the bullet, made up my mind, and donated all of the traditional art stuff. I personally haven't looked back, realising I don't miss it afterall and never really intended to seriously use it again. 

That's just me, though. But maybe it'd be worthwhile testing the things you don't use so much anymore (if you don't paint so much anymore, try painting again, or using pencils again etc) and if you aren't feeling it too much, maybe it's not worth keeping things around?"

I like my things a lot, but I cannot keep packing them all up and taking them with me.

I have a gold dinosaur ornament on my bedside table and it's the perfect example of what I mean.

interestingasfuck,f1zdsl7,t3_db2nbp,1569842057.0,"As a student who public-transports everywhere and doesn't drive.... sure, but there's good reasons people prefer driving. 

My commute to uni used to take me almost two hours and it was the only possible commute. It was a 20 minute bus ride, 20 minute train ride, and then a 40 minute bus ride. My uni was a 20 minute drive away from my parents' house, in BAD traffic. The commute routes travelled all over the coast before reaching the campus. I had to move it got so annoying, and it's a good indicator of what public transport here is like as a whole (Australia, southeast QLD). 

Everyone who can drive, drives as soon as possible and as often as possible, because the country is massive, everything is spaced way the hell out, and the public transport isn't for shit. 

Also, and it's unfortunate, but a lot of drugged-up or mentally ill people take the buses in particular, and it can get uncomfortable if not borderline dangerous. People with disabilities definitely have to travel just like everyone else and more power to them, but I once saw a young couple in a pram have to get off a bus in fear because an obviously very mentally ill woman started screaming at their baby and demanding to see it, and generally freaking them the hell out that she was going to try and snatch their kid. She was getting all up in their space, the works.   
Another time, a teenage boy had a full blown mental breakdown on a train I was on and he and another kid with him started threatening to bash other people in the carriage, including me. Everyone had to basically evacuate the carriage because this kid was freaking out and punching windows and kicking the doors and his friend was yelling about how if anyone ""looked"" at him he'd ""punch their face in"".   
I don't think anyone like... feared for their life, in either case, but it's understandably not a pleasant experience and one that most people would rather avoid, myself included. 

It's not a daily occurrence, but if I had the means, things like this would have scared me into getting a car and a license years ago. Unfortunately I don't have the means. I'm a 22 year old woman who probably couldn't hold my own in a fight with a crazy or a drug addict and accutely aware of that fact when someone flips out on public transport and I'm stuck with them in a small confined space for another 20 to 40 minutes on an express train. 

Australia's pretty safe and the public transport's pretty cheap, so I don't have much to complain about in all honesty especially not compared to a lot of other people on here probably in a much worse situation, but there's always justifiable reasons people just choose not to put up with the massive inconvenience and not-insignificant safety risks of public transport."

I find that Dress To Impress is the best guide for it if you're stuck finding the perfect one. 

Usually I can find the exact right things for the type of customisation I want, even if some of them sometimes range up into the crazy prices and I need to pick something similar but cheaper. 

But I agree, there doesn't seem to be a lot... I'm stuck finding ANYTHING for a mutant, because there are like 2-3 wearables for the entire colour..."

Dailies mean you consistently have SOMETHING to do, there's always cool randomised events to hope for, tons of games to play... it CAN get a little grindy and repetitive, and some mechanics (feeding pets, mostly) I find to be annoyingly slow on occasion, but if you're playing it for a zen thing like I am it is super worth it. 

Just don't expect a TON OF ACTION or super-fast progress (very very grindy!), and it might not be the best fit if you don't have downtime to spend, but other than that I say go for it."
