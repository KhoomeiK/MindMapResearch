I told her extremely clearly: ""If you do that again, I'm going to hit you."". Guess she didn't believe me, because she did and I busted her fucking lip. Then of course the bitch calls her parents over (turned out she lived a few houses away) and the dad is wearing American flag patterned parachute pants, an American flag bandana on his head and a wife beater. (Classssic) Her mom is tanned to hell and disgusting and it's just completely obvious to me at this point that the family is trash. Theeeen ...... THEY called the police! IIIII knaaaaooowwww raaaiiiighhttt? Meanwhile, I'm crying cause I was emotional lol :(. & while the cops are on the way the youth group adults actually left me alone in the room with the girls parents which was completely fucking stupid. The mom was playing detective & trying to figure out if her daughter had hit me ""like a disrespect"" or ""actually hard"". Hmmm think that might be part of the problem? Your shitty parenting where a completely unwarranted assault is alright if it's below a certain pressure? 🤔 Bitch IDGAF WHAT it was, I warned her. Shes lucky she didn't get it on the first one. THAT was actually me being patient. She's lucky I didn't keep fucking going bruh. Should've got her twice and evened the score. Welp anyway so after that a few little ""heroes"" aka loser fucks came to try and find me and yelled U hiT A gUrL!? and shoved me. At that point my friends were around me and told them to leave me alone. I still hold a bit of a grudge that the one kid got away with that shove... which is messed up of me but there were like 3 and they were bigger. Plus the police were already on the way. He's already gotten what he deserves though by living his life. That kid was always there to get away from his dad and stuff bc his home was shit. But .. he was still a dumbass 😒So the cops got there and put me in the back of an SUV but they tried to make it clear it was only for my protection from the her parents. And I was like... alright idk if I trust you but at least someone is thinking about that. and then I told this detective exactly what happened, I suppose the little bitch did too, whose name turned out to be Lex. Because the detective ended up saying to the girl not to hit people if she doesn't want to get hit. My mom came and got me. I was texting my friends on the way home and I guess most people were running around saying AiDAN Got ArREsTeD 4 HiTiNg A GURLLL!!!! Dumb. Sons. Of. Bitches."
