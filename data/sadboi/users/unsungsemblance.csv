depression,fp8yvr6,t3_g9ndgw,1588407913.0,"I absolutely understand how you feel. I'm in the same boat. At 15 I was heavily abused for 6 months and almost murdered. Ended up pregnant by my abuser, family forbid me from aborting/adoption. 

I think my spark died the night I was almost beaten to death. I'm 21 now. I've come out of the closet as trans and I'm now 5 months on Testosterone. I moved in with the love of my life last year, and just recently came up on our one year! But, I still feel unfulfilled. I recently learned about depersonalization. I've been having less stone-faced numb dissociative episodes but recently it's been more of ""this isnt my body"", I don't feel human, ""I don't feel real"" and ""I'm not in control of myself and I'm just going through the motions"". 

I've come a really long way from where I used to be, 16 and having a full blown panic attack in the Dollar General because I couldn't get the bathroom key to work, to being asked if I was interested in management at my job, but everything is still super muddled and bland. I'm hoping to get into therapy soon but without insurance it looks pretty bleak."
