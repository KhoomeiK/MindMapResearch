The best advice I have is that in addition to changing your account numbers, usernames, email, passwords and 2FA, contact your bank, credit accounts, the IRS, any state agencies (i.e. Department of licensing), and the 3 credit bureaus and have them place an identity theft flag (and credit freeze) on your profile. This will alert their customer service reps to be extra cautious if someone calls claiming to be you.

You also may want to switch to using credit cards for as many of your bills and regular purchases as possible (and then pay in full every month). This is because credit cards have better fraud protections than checking accounts, and your odds of getting money back are better.


Storytime:

1. I have personally been through identity theft. The only way I knew about it was because my card was registered in Square and they sent me an emailed receipt automatically. The receipt showed a signature which was clearly not mine. But all the billing info was and the businessperson said they had an ID with that info too (but not an ID for my state). Obviously someone put work into it. I was able to send all that to the bank as proof of theft. It was a huge amount of work for $600. 

2. My dad was traveling in Texas. He got a call from his credit card company. Someone with a Texas accent had called to recover their account access. He was spoofing my dad's phone number and had all identifying information, including my mom's (shared account), but the rep was suspicious. So while the fraudster was still on the line, they called my dad and asked a series of security questions.shere he went to school, etc. The fraudster got my grandmother's maiden name wrong, and that was the only thing that clinched it. 

Serious kudos to that rep for being alert and well trained. We never figured out how they knew something was wrong, since this was before most companies were using identity theft screening!"

explainlikeimfive,fjcg2sx,t3_fciym2,1583218741.0,"Night sweats can be caused by many things. Some sweating at night is normal, but soaking your sheets isn't.

The cause can depend on your gender, your age and your overall health.

The hypothalamus in the brain regulates body temperature. Temperature drops when you sleep, and rises when you are ready to wake. It actually isn't unusual to wake this way midway through your sleep cycle, be awake for a short time, and then go back to sleep. Many people do this. So waking up and feeling warm could simply be the end of one of these periods. Conversely, if you haven't finished a natural sleep cycle when it's time to wake up, you might feel cold.

Various other things can lead to disregulation of the hypothalamus, including poor quality sleep (e.g., sleep apnea, poor environment, and various medications). Or it may be something directly affecting your autonomic nervous system which controls sweating.

A few things you can try first are getting more sleep, changing your bedding or room temperature, adjusting light sources in the room, getting adequate exercise during the day, losing weight (if you are overweight), and adjusting when and what you eat (earlier dinners are better).

If the sweating feels excessive to you, please see your doctor. While it's possible you are experiencing something totally normal, it could also be a sign that something is wrong, and they are the only ones qualified to tell you for sure."

Then I added an SSRI to the mix and I sweat like crazy at night. I did some research and this is because seratonin regulates (among other things) the autonomic nervous system which controls sweating. So higher levels of seratonin floating around will make you sweat more.

I started taking the pills in the morning instead of evening and that helped knock it back some. But between anxiety attacks and needing a few more navy baths than I used to, I'll take the latter."

1. Speak to your manager's manager directly (approach him/her to ""clarify"" the WFH policy, and use specific examples).
2. Speak to another manager outside your group. 
2. Speak to HR. 

Personally, I've had manager before who were skeptical of how I did work. It doesn't help to push the issue with them if they're like that, because that will just reinforce their views. It's much better to solicit a 3rd viewpoint.

I wouldn't use the ""Coworker X said..."" argument. You don't know that person's individual circumstances and the policy may have changed since then. However, you can encourage your coworkers to approach their managers to let the company know the policy may be applied inconsistently. Multiple workers making the same complaint gets attention!

Lastly, accept that the policy may not land in your favor. Honestly, WFH is a privilege (one I would practically kill for), and you should treat it as such. It's fine to encourage your company to offer more flexibility, but acting entitled to it won't be received well.

Anxiety,evuyd9a,t3_clbhgd,1564810978.0,"I am 100% a real health & safety specialist so please trust that I'm giving you the best information.

Asbestos is not dangerous when it's not ""friable"" meaning that it's not being actively moved around. It's a dense mineral fiber and will quickly settle in still air. In many places where you might find it, like in very old mortar, it's locked into the material and won't come out easily.

Even if the insulation contains asbestos, if it is sitting in your attic and you are not constantly walking over it, moving it, sweeping it, etc.it is not getting released into the air and does not pose a risk to you and your family. The reason to test it is so that if someone does have to work around it, they can be aware that they should have adequate training and protective equipment before they disturb the material. That's why there are people who specialize in asbestos removal (and why it's expensive) . 

The people who contract asbestos-related disease are people who work with asbestos frequently. Like demolition workers, electricians, rennovators, miners, etc. As with anything, the health risk of asbestos is high the longer and more intensely someone is exposed. As I said above, ""exposure"" in this case means directly working with it, breathing in a lot of its dust. That's why it's considered an ""occupational hazard"". Just being near something with asbestos or having a very brief exposure isn't enough to hurt someone.

I'll give you an example: aspirin. You might take a pill or two to deal with a headache. The effect lasts a few hours, and you feel better, and there's few if any side effects. That doesn't mean you'll feel awesome for days if you take the whole bottle at once; in fact you'll be very sick. This is true with pretty much anything you are exposed to.  As the old adage goes, ""it's the dose that makes the poison"".

It's still a good idea to know if there's asbestos around, so you can avoid disturbing it and maybe think about getting someone to remove it in the future. But I promise your family is not at risk if you can't take care of it soon, or from your father in law picking a bit up once. Just leave it alone from now on, and you'll all be just fine."

Anxiety,evuwsvk,t3_clcwrl,1564809211.0,"Try to establish a routine. Add it to a thing you already do reliably and that comforts you, like brushing your teeth or getting dressed. If it helps, set a special alarm to remind you about it.

I'll an attack and feeling bad for feeling bad and not understanding why I was crying and throwing up and cold and unable to do the things I normally do. And to make matters worse my anxiety attacks are all about being in control. Feeling like you utterly cannot handle yourself is the worst. 

Do you take meds? The best thing I ever did was get on SSRIs. It doesn't stop every attack but it definitely makes them milder which means I can recover more quickly.

There are other things that help like practicing mindfulness. It takes time and patience with yourself. Next time you have an attack try this coping technique: http://www.therapistsb.com/blog/post/5-4-3-2-1-coping-technique"

So you can just say, ""I'm not feeling well, I need a break."" Most decent people won't pry.

But yes, finding a therapist is a good step. Or even just visiting your regular doctor. Getting some antidepressants helped me out of a bad spot."

aww,evs6p8v,t1_evrtp1w,1564732478.0,"If the dog was really aggressive it would be lunging against the leash and facing the person. It is backed up against the wall, hunching its body, and snapping in defense. It's just scared. It's sadly common for people not familiar with dogs to mistake that for aggression. But really all the dog is doing is trying to be left alone.

But that's why the groomer's technique works. Shes using a calming tone of voice. She's using the back of her hand, which is a human body language gesture for non-aggression (dogs are very good at reading human body language). She is hunched over to make herself smaller and less intimidating. She's not making eye contact or trying to touch its face. She's sending all the correct social cues to the dog that she is not a threat."

Anxiety,evs5pc6,t3_ckxwt7,1564731142.0,"Don't engage.

Reacting to people who are rude just escalates the problem. Whether they are trying to get a rise out of you or are just a jerk, you will be the better person for refusing to play by their rules.

And I don't mean be passive-aggressive, fake-nice. Just don't acknowledge them at all. Don't reward their behavior with your attention."
Anxiety,evs5i2t,t3_ckwah2,1564730870.0,"I totally understand. Facing the mortality of yourself and those you love is a challenge for most of us.

I actually really love the Order of the Good Death/Ask a Mortician. They're an organization committed to de-stigmatizing death and teaching acceptance and beauty and even absurd humor of it. They call themselves ""death positive"" but they aren't an organization that promotes self-harm or anything. Exploring how different cultures through time have treated death - both in practical terms and spiritually - has been a really interesting experience for me personally. Though if you are highly sensitive to death imagery some of what they have there might be too much for you.

The most important thing is, give yourself time. You will have good days, where you can embrace the present instead of worrying about the future. Let them find you. It will be okay."
Anxiety,evs4ofh,t3_ckzmn5,1564729787.0,"Yes, I've had them. More often though, I have them right after I go home. I'm always worrying that I'm bad at my job or people don't like me and I'll lose my job and money and house and everything. Antidepressants have helped some, but even still I get the occasional full-blown panic attack and it HAS resulted in misunderstandings at work. Not fatal ones. But I definitely wish things were different.

I second the commenter who said be open with your boss, if you are able. If you don't feel like explaining everything (and I get it! mental illness is hard to explain!) just say that you're health isn't great, and you may need to take short breaks from the office. Then go for a walk. Go sit in the bathroom, go somewhere quiet where you feel safe. Personally when I'm having a hard day I like to get out and go pick up some takeout lunch. If there aren't many places you can escape to, try a pair of good noise-isolating headphones - the big ones everyone can see. It's usually a polite sign that you'd like to be left alone.

This doesn't work with all bosses, of course. I've had both bosses who are sympathetic and bosses who give zero f\*cks, as well as bosses who are nice but utterly clueless. Since you've been in a good job, you probably have at least some sense of where some of your co-workers fall on that scale.

If your employer's big enough to have an HR department, consider talking to them. Having a health condition is a protected right in many countries, so if HR knows they can help smooth things over with  management. Same if you have an employee union, or similar sort of organization.

Lastly, if you have a doctor treating you for these occasional bouts, you can have them write you a note that you can keep around, explaining what happens and what you need when it does. Doctor's letters are hard to refute and provide a cushion between your in-the-moment stress and your co-workers."

The X chromosome contains some genes that the Y doesn't, since the Y is missing a 'leg'. I don't know all of them but some genes would be missing that contribute to hormone balancing, the immune system, and color vision. So they would probably be at increased risk of many types of disorders.
