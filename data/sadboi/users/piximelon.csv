1. What do you think the vast majority of us here in this thread right now can do about Dahvie Vanity other than raising awareness? This post is doing exactly that. Raising awareness. 

2. Most of the comments here have been focused on what's important. There are people literally saying that this is NOT drama or tea, this is a serious thing. There are some comments that are mainly focused on J* but I'm honestly not sure why y'all are so butthurt considering that it doesn't hurt to raise awareness about his lack of morals either. J* has also screwed over at least one survivor all on his own by pretending like he didn't see things he actually did see. He isn't exactly irrelevant here. 

3. I can't speak for anyone but myself here, but I have been pretty invested in this investigation from the beginning. I've listened to all of the survivors and I've participated in the subreddit that's solely focused on Dahvie and his crimes. Thinking that you know the intentions of everyone in this thread or claiming that they only care about canceling J* is pointless and ridiculous. Discussing Jeffree does not mean that someone only cares about the Jeffree aspect. 

4. To turn your own logic around on you... are you a J* stan? It sure seems like you resent his name being brought up on BEAUTY GURU CHATTER a whole lot. 

5. Your opinion so far has been the most harmful and counterproductive in this entire thread, because you're basically telling us to shut up about this investigation on this subreddit. If we can't look at Jeffree and his part in this, we can't discuss it here. I guarantee you there are psople who wouldn't know about this other than looking at this sub.

You knew no good would come of it, but you selfishly did it anyway. Grandma just sounds like an irritating, meddling old lady."
BeautyGuruChatter,fpnqym4,t3_gehgej,1588770646.0,"Now this is disappointing and unexpected. I didn't watch a lot of her stuff because like someone else mentioned, her music selections were not my thing... but like everyone else I was stunned by how talented and beautiful she is and I was really expecting her to blow up at some point."
BeautyGuruChatter,fpnqqzz,t1_fpnhr6x,1588770508.0,"Omg thank you. I really like most of those chill aesthetic tutorials without speaking but the music in her videos in particular always gets stuck in my head in a ""wow I wish this shit wasn't stuck in my head"" kind of way."
AmItheAsshole,fpl1idx,t3_gdu178,1588704723.0,"Your stepmom is a giant asshole for talking about adopting you when you have a present mother who supports you financially and yes, gave birth to you. Is your mother abusive? Is she actually neglectful? Doesn't sound like it."
Visiblemending,fpjsj3v,t1_fpjsamf,1588679755.0,"Typically I agree with you but at least in my case, those gloves get filthy and they smell awful. The grippy part also wears off of the fingertips and they become basically useless. I replace mine every other week."
Visiblemending,fpjp7a8,t1_fphn1na,1588676729.0,"I work in a warehouse and it would be fine in my case, I wear similar gloves every night just to make sure I don't rip a fingernail or get paper cuts from boxes. Also helps out with gripping stuff. My question is why you would want to mend those smelly things instead of just getting new ones, I mean they're like 3 bucks."
BPD,fpgzs56,t1_fpg8sxu,1588612433.0,FWIW most people wanted to be like effy or Cassie after they watched skins ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
BeautyGuruChatter,fpgzmrt,t1_fpgbcco,1588612357.0,"Pressed pigments are kind of known for being difficult though, and even I have to use a light base with pastels and I'm pretty pale, like I don't think that's specific to his brand."
BeautyGuruChatter,fpdzm4n,t1_fpdz870,1588537416.0,"Yeah, it's mostly people around my own age (25-26) I see complaining."
BeautyGuruChatter,fpdp9te,t3_gcsbo8,1588531489.0,"This isn't surprising to me. Totally forgot about the more gatekeepy, one-uppy side of being an emo kid (just in case I need to say this, not *all* emo kids are like this) until I joined tiktok. Just go take a look at how butthurt people are that a Pierce the Veil song is a new tiktok trend, because apparently the people using the audio haven't suffered enough to use it lol

Edit: fwiw I will *always* identify as an emo kid, no matter how far I stray from the aesthetic. I'm an emo kid who tends to dress like a fairy princess or something. It isn't supposed to be about the way you look. I just wanted to clarify that I'm not hating on emo as a concept or anything, but most of us who behaved like shitheads during ""peak emo"" (2005-2009 imo) were literally children at the time and have grown up and out of being bullies or placing so much importance on how big we can tease our hair. It sucks that grown ass people are *still* missing the point."
BeautyGuruChatter,fp6zi43,t3_gbl66a,1588361326.0,"I've enjoyed using the products that I have, I think the products themselves are great really  (I have a skin frost palette, 3 eyeshadow palettes and a couple of the liquid lipsticks). Which ya know, sucks because I stopped buying from him a while back and never will again. These days there are so many good brands making the fun colors I like to wear *and* opportunities to support small indie brands that there's just no way I could justify buying from him."
AmItheAsshole,fp56bww,t1_fp502eu,1588317802.0,"Yeah, and just like you're using ""I couldn't have known there would be a pandemic"" as your reasoning, your son couldn't have known that he would have no income or be fucked over by agreeing to help you out. Your son sounds.like a responsible person and you aren't willing to help him out the one time he needs you to?"
AmItheAsshole,fp5638v,t3_gbd4me,1588317560.0,NTA. You were genuinely worried for your husband. It's not like you make this a habit.
AmItheAsshole,fp561a5,t1_fp54kiz,1588317505.0,An extremely drunk person who's made it to the sloppy sad stage and is talking about wanting to die *is* in danger and much more likely to act on their feelings than a sober person.
femalefashionadvice,fp53whq,t3_ga7yws,1588315478.0,afashionnerd is one of my faves on tiktok and Instagram!

BPD,fp2jwxe,t1_fp2jldm,1588263029.0,"I'm pretty certain that that's the case, I guess a better question to ask would be if anyone else has had their preference about pets connected to their diagnosis. It's happened to me enough times for me to be annoyed by it, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
cottagecore,fp292tt,t3_gaee2e,1588257548.0,Omg! I have part of this set! I found it at goodwill.
BeautyGuruChatter,fp28key,t1_fp244b1,1588257271.0,This is the first thing that came out of my husband's mouth the one time I tried watching one of his videos. He isn't into makeup or anything like that but pretty astute observation lol
BeautyGuruChatter,fp22yvc,t1_fp1pl8u,1588254075.0,So you decided my opinion violates rule 1 because you don't like it? That's great.
BeautyGuruChatter,fozrl1v,t1_fozit7s,1588195635.0,One trillion percent agree.
BeautyGuruChatter,fozrfff,t1_foz79ei,1588195559.0,I'm ready for the downvotes because seeing someone say it's the *worst* pain there is when people lose children is ridiculous. Like imagine someone who lost a child reading that
AskReddit,foyzd7d,t1_foyfk7m,1588181981.0,Nah it was probably 2 or 3 in the morning and it sounded like people just casually moving around and talking to each other. Definitely wasn't construction or banging around. Like I said I think I was just more stressed out than I had ever been and I was hallucinating.
AskReddit,foy8pb8,t1_foxv3tb,1588167793.0,"I have only had this happen one time, and it was when I was 17 and had just been admitted to a ""behavioral health unit"" aka mental hospital for the first time. I think it happened because I was under extreme stress because my mental issues never had anything to do with psychosis or hallucinations. The building was only one story, there was no upstairs, but I woke up one night and swore that there were people walking around above my head and talking to each other. It really bugged me and the staff (obviously) acted like I was just crazy."
BPD,fox6f5b,t3_ga0zyn,1588135225.0,"Many ""normal"" teenagers and even young adults exhibit some of the traits of BPD just due to being young and emotional/hormonal/not having coping skills yet. I got my diagnosis at 21 when my treatment team was able to establish a clear pattern of behaviors with me, but it had been brought up as a possibility before then."
BPD,fox62je,t3_ga2dv8,1588134974.0,"I've seen a lot of people say this on this sub, so you definitely aren't alone. I have the opposite experience though, empathy was something I had to actively work toward and be mindful of. I'm not naturally empathetic and I kind of had to learn when I *should* be empathetic and go from there."
