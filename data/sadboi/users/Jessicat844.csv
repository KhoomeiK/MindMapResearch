offmychest,fpwm4b0,t3_gfug3c,1588965875.0,"I️ totally agree with this. My abusive ex admitted that he began watching at 10 years old. Because he had free reign of the internet he ended up going from normal porn, to violent gang bang porn, to father daughter fantasy porn and god knows what else. When I️ found our about the father daughter porn I️ got pushed into a wall. Before we broke up he was so addicted that he’d watch it on the trains to work even with people around him.

My ex after that was very Christian, said that all men watch porn, yet at the same time admitted it ruined his childhood. He and his 2 brothers were addicted to it and it constantly led to guilt and shame because of their religion and the flat out addiction. 

My current bf said he’d watched it in his teens, but even then he kept the self control to keep it to the milder vids. Since we got together we both don’t watch it. I️ used to watch it occasionally when I️ was with my exes but if I’m being honest it was mostly to make me feel better about them watching it so much. Now I️ could care less, and when I️ have children I️ will make sure they don’t get that early access that robs their innocence after seeing how badly it affected my exes. My bf also wants this. It’s just not natural you know? We didn’t evolve watching porn. Now it’s so easily accessible - millions of videos. Not to mention the damn dark web. It’s honestly sad.

OH and it partly ruined my parents marriage. My dad was so addicted that he’d put it on if she went to bed early in the living room. Sometimes I’d walk out and hear it. Really made me disgusted with my dad for years. He even left porn dvds in my ps2 as a kid! Like wtf?! My grandpa partook as well. Found pages of it taped to his garage walls as a kid. As a child I️ was partially convinced they were creeps, just because it was just right there. At least try to hide it from children for fucks sake lol."

After that consider some of our strongest creatures and realize that after millions of years of evolution creatures survive and grow stronger, or they don’t and die out. 

There are so many possibilities of reptile-like aliens, or hell, maybe just giant hamster aliens. It’s possible they evolved to see love as a detriment. It’s possible they are even kinder and more loving than us. It’s possible they could give two fucks about other creatures, or maybe they yearn for discovery like us.

He sounds like he needs intensive therapy on his own. He has to want to change and has to commit. However from the abuses I’ve been through and seen myself - this does not look good and you deserve so much better.

He will talk to her like he has been talking to you. If the dog is shaking it’s possible he’s even abused it in private. 

Run. 

I’ve been with this type of man and I️ myself have had anger issues. I’ve pushed a garbage can over around my current S.O. and I️ have committed fully to therapy. I️ could never imagine harming an animal, my partner, or saying such terrible things to him. He would never say those things to me. 

However, my ex once called me a cunt 32 times while pushing me into a wall. We were together 5 years and it escalated each year. Started with verbal abuse, then pushing, moved to hitting, moved to throwing my glasses off my face, spitting, cheating on me, and finally ended with him throwing me into a window and strangling me.

I️ have met a good man now. I️ could never see him ever laying a hand on me or verbally abusing me. That is how it should be. They are out there. There are more good than bad - unfortunately people like us that have been in abusive families can be beacons for abusive partners. The only way to silence the beacon is not standing for ANY abuse EVER. The moment it happens, leave. Even one red flag appears that signals abuse, avoid any relationship with them.
