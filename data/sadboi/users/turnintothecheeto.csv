MatebookXPro,fekp49f,t3_eotd0j,1579204687.0,"I wouldn't recommend it. Mine was working fine until September this year, then started having  BSODS sporadically. Eventually I found out the SSD was dying during finals week. That was fun.

I sent it to them last month for repair ( I didn't want to repair it myself idk  why), still haven't gotten it back…. still have no laptop 

so no this company/laptop has given me hell thru its poor reliability"

It's weird though as no errors show up on sfc/scannow and the like. How hard is it to install a new SSD, they're fairly cheap so why not."
