depression,flxx3sn,t1_flxv3wp,1585591477.0,"Yeah I know. Right now I can resist this anger and hatred. I don't want these. I really don't but I can't help it. I constantly seek for help. Actually kinda getting help but due to corona it stopped for a while. I use drugs. Normally I live away from my parents but again due to corona I am stuck at home. There's no way that they could understand what I am feeling right now. I try to tell them so little but they can't even understand that. They think I don't need any help, I'm just making everything up in my mind, I overthink so basically I shouldn't, the help I'm getting by my own is useless, drugs make me worse etc. I am really scared that I won't be able to control myself and I'll fuck everything up even more."

DecidingToBeBetter,fkh3wvz,t1_fkgpbjv,1584187614.0,Expectations suck yet I can't get rid of them. I wonder whether other people can or not. Aren't expectations kind of nature of relationships? We don't build them on expectations or benefits but I think we constantly expect things from each other.
DecidingToBeBetter,fkh3llu,t1_fkf7q6v,1584187269.0,I do see a therapist for a while and will continue to do but the problem with therapy is there is too many things to figure out and too little time :D
DecidingToBeBetter,fkh3icp,t1_fkf1dvr,1584187167.0,"> You need to give the other person room to talk so you can have an actual conversation instead of you talking way more. 

It is not the actual problem in my case. I don't have that mindset of I always want to talk and others to listen. I want it to be mutual. I want to tell them things I love or I struggle with but I also want to know theirs. I think I am a good listener. Not just like passively listening. I always try to empathize with them and react to them kindly. I wish I had people around me that wanna tell everything about them just like me. So I don't think my problem is selfishness. Actually I am pretty much selfless person but that's another issue.

The main problem is I expect care from them because I care about them and what they're saying. This occurs especially in non-face-to-face conversations. I send someone a post that I like on Instagram and I expect him/her to react to it. In a WhatsApp group of ""close friends"", I say, ask or share something and I expect a reaction. When there is no reaction my anxiety automatically makes me assume that they don't really care about me. They are bored and annoyed with me.

From one perspective I know that I share too many things and I understand people finding it annoying but on the other hand, I think that sharing things means that you care about the other person."

depression,fke3wjn,t1_fke3dpu,1584104505.0,I try to do that.
