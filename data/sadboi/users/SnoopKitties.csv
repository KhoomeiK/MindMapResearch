Elite is approximately the top 2.5% of players. Even though there are a lot of people who don’t try that hard, top 2.5% is still very good.

Once you get use to falcon in either of those games, playing him in ultimate will probs just be a disappointment.

If you want to play either of them, it is pretty easy to set up an emulator to play these games on a computer, so that you don’t need to go and buy a wii or GameCube. Just go to smash ladder.com! There you can both get everything set up and find online matches(the online is actually much better than ultimate if you have everything set up well, are using lan and playing someone close to you).

 I very biased towards PM(now P+) because it’s my favorite smash game by far, but I do recommend it over melee if you are coming from ultimate. Falcon I believe is significantly better in PM than he is in melee, but also every melee player knows how to destroy Falcon since they have been doing it for so long. PM also has a lot of ‘nice to haves’  that melee does not, including the auto L cancel setting.

DK can combo cargo up throw into like six up airs if you do it right. For higher percents he can cargo->full hop->up throw->DK punch or forward air for very early kills at pretty wide percent windows. At very high percents he can do a cargo forward/back throw DI mix up. If they DI in, you can follow up with nair.

Ganondorf can chain grab almost everyone: up throw for fast falling characters, down throw for everyone else. When they get too high percent to chain grab he can down throw forward air for a kill or at least big damage.

Ice climbers can do hand offs where popo throws them and then nana catches them and throws them again. 


Probably easier to list characters that don’t get a lot off of grabs than characters that do. Charizard and falco don’t get much off of grabs when against an opponent who knows how to DI. I don’t think puff has any good grab followups on anyone who isn’t a star fox character."

When you do have snails that are breeding there are a few ways you can keep the population in check:

1) Really limit the food you put in your tank. 

2) Get a fish that will eat snails

3) Buy a snail that eats snails(Assassin snail)

4) put snail traps in your tank. I haven’t done this myself but I hear it isn’t too hard.

My recommendation is that if you like snails get yourself some nerite snails! They code about $4 each, can’t breed in fresh water and are a lot bigger and more colorful than ramshorn snails."
