He's still out there acting like he's a role model, so I actually do think the constant reminders are necessary. We can't stop the fan club from blindly loving him but we can keep his crimes in the mind of the general public.

For a more in depth understanding of intimate partner violence and emotional/verbal abuse I highly recommend Lundy Bancroft's Why Does He Do That and of course loveisrespect.org.

The criticism of White Feminists (not feminists who are white) is that they only fight for people of their same social class, ethnicity, physical & cognitive abilities, genders and sexual orientation. Intersectionality is the idea that all of these factors create layers of oppression, and being aware of our relative privileges is an important part of the fight for equality for all humans. As Audre Lorde famously said; ""i am not free while any woman is unfree, even when her shackles may be very different from my own"".
