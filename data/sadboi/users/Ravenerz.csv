I believe there are certain topics that night be viewed as 1 side and not the other even tho its not having to do with 1 side or the other just that either side has claimed certain issues to be pro on so now people can only associate these topics as red or blue instead of viewing the topic as a human right. I believe our issues is the fact people can't just separate themselves of the titles red and blue and view the topic in a logical way. They end up refusing things because they feel if they agree then it's giving ""the other side"" a ""win"" or giving in to them and by golly we just can't have that and so time gets spent on how either side can stop the other from advancing anything instead of logically working together to better life for everyone else. It's always either balls to the wall extreme left or ditto to the right. It's never a logical compromise or anything close.

No not because I was in the military, my father and grandfather were and set me up. I made the mistake of getting that car and dumping $650 on monthly payments, at the time and for just a couple years after it wasn't much. Messed up made my insurance go to almost $400 a month. So for 5 yrs I dumped a house payment on this vehicle. Some will ask why not rid yourself of it. Well at first it was because it was my dream car, well close, they remade the 5.0 and I nabbed me one.  Second and most important reason was my father passed while I was paying for it and he Co signed for me and nothing else. Him seeing me get my dream car made him the happiest I'd seen and I couldn't part with that. So I stuck it out and did everything I could to keep on to it. Work and salary made drastic jumps through the years since. But! I'm happy to say its paid off. I will never again go for something like that or do anything as rash as that.

Don't know if that one lived or not but again I like to think he shook it off and went on about his day.

They mislead the public the the typical AR-15 even tho it is literally less powerful than the hunting rifles that no one talks about, the only difference is the way the gun looks. They just changed the look of the gun, and round capacity. They use the word assault rifle irresponsibly and they stick it with the AR making people believe that's what AR in AR-15 means. 
Also even if OP or anyone else for that matter had/has a hand fun, the last thing you should do is take another person's life, that is only your absolute last option after trying everything else. Mast people stop their attack or advancements when that gun comes out. You never want to take a life, that sticks with you and IF you do have to take a life you make sure you put them down for good, some have tried to turn around and Sue even tho they were absolutely the ones in the wrong 100%, some have even succeeded somehow in their law suits. 
Sappydark I do hope I have helped with information, I do not expect you to change your views to mine. I only wanted to help with information and facts on the matter. I hope you have an amazing day and please be safe!!"
LetsNotMeet,fnh41w1,t1_fngvb60,1586954296.0,"Those were absolutely not military grade weapons, every gun shoots as fast as you can pull the trigger.. they were all semi-auto, every gun is semi-auto which means single shot. Pistols are semi-auto, those rifles the Vegas shooter used were infact less powerful than your dads hunting rifle. Absolutely no one can get same day guns. The only way that is possible is if you were buying it off someone in the streets who didn't care who it was going to. No you can not go to a gun show and get one that same day either. If you some how do find someone that does this then you shouldn't be doing business with that person and report them Immediately, that seller would also be held responsible for anything illegal that gun was used for. There is no way to better regulate guns, we have all the laws we can have for them. Everyone's quick to say regulate better but no one has or gives any ideas that would keep people from going off their rocker.. what needs to happen is better mental health care. It's not the guns that are the issue but everyone is so quick to blame guns and tell everyone else what they should and shouldn't have.. guns are not the issue here, people who some how get radicalized are the issue, mental health is the issue. Those guns the shooter had didn't make him insane and tell him to shoot people. 
It doesn't matter what you think I should and shouldnt have or what's necessary. It's my right as a responsible and law aniding American citizen, if I want a 150 round drum for my AK-47 and I'm a law abiding citizen whose passed a background check (which I have, multiple times and actually just recently after waiting for over a month before being able to purchase another gun) then I should be able to have it."
LetsNotMeet,fnh36lm,t1_fnh28m5,1586953626.0,"Didnt say anyone was taking guns away. You've gone and read too far into my comment. I was merely stating that people speak out against any type of gun ownership and this situation right here is a very good example of need/knowing you're safer having one. It's the piece of mind some get knowing that they won't have to fear for their lives. I didn't come on here to debate guns or gun control, doing so would be taking attention away from OP and what she's gone through and currently dealing with.  If you feel the need to debate guns and ""military grade"" guns then that should take place somewhere else. 

Small comment - the guns the Vegas shooter used was in no way ""military grade"" weapons. No civilian has military grade weapons or access to them unless they have a special permit and that's not easy nor cheap to come by. Those rifles were all hunting rifles and even those were smaller caliber and less forceful then most hunting rifles. Some simple research and educating yourself on guns would debunk this myth the media spreads. Don't take everything you hear from the news at fact. No gun is called an assault rifle. AR in AR-15 stands for ARMALITE which is infact the name of the gun/manufacturer."
LetsNotMeet,fngujuq,t1_fnglwks,1586945493.0,"He would need to be showing intent to harm, like breaking the window and coming in the house. Lots of times they need to be brandishing a weapon, since she's female he can over power her just by sheer strength.  That alone should be enough to use deadly force since she would be in her right to fear for her life. Do not quote me on this as I do not know the laws of that state, only the state I live in (Tx). People speak out against gun ownership but this situation right here shows that it's important. In this situation I'd feel a hell of a lot safer and I'd imagine anyone in this thread would too if they owned a firearm. 

OP I'm sorry this happened to you and I hope they catch him and that you and your kids are safe again.

When owning a gun and running into a scenario like this or similar, the last thing you should do is take a persons life. You shoot and kill ONLY when ever other option has been tried and proven unsuccessfully. It should never be your first option unless they are charging you with a weapon and do not stop after seeing your firearm. Please, please, please be responsible and use good judgement when handling or owning a gun/guns. They are not toys to fuck around and be irresponsible with. They can have serious repercussions when mishandling one. 
Stay say everyone especially with all that's going on today, I love you all! No matter your views or opinions.

Even to this day I still deal with damned if I do damned if I dont situations. The I still made the wrong choice or I can't believe you spent money on yourself. You chose to go back after being kicked out I stead of cutting them off completely. Everyone has a choice and for you to act like you don't is absurd. Maybe try empowering the people around you that go through things like this instead of going for defeat. I understand there's kids under 18 that can't do anything about their situation yet and that's a different matter. You admitting defeat and giving in and allowing them to walk all over you is your choice, Don't act like it's not. Choose better for yourself, there's plenty of others who've been where you are and chose to stay out of the house and fight to make it on their own, then there's the ones who give in and make excuses as to why they can't."

teenagers,fnci5j9,t1_fnbez19,1586837356.0,"I once had my parents try to take my car from me even tho it was completely registered in my name. (Thanks to my grandma, she made it to where they couldn't do anything other than register it in my name only since I paid for it with my own money, just so they couldn't hold it over my head or threaten me with it.) They tried to say they were going to take my car away from me because I was saying out till 3am at 18, I lived in my grandmother's house, parents were divorced and my mother lived in my gmas house too, my GMA didn't care as long as I was safe. Well when they threatened me I told them go for but the moment they took it I'd report it stolen and would press charges and that if they thought I was lying then to go ahead and try me. They never threatened me with it again.  I told them I'd compromise and come home at 2am and that was that. I came home when ever I wanted and there wasn't shit they could do about it. GMA loved me more than anyone else. I took care of that woman till the day she decided to go be with my Gpa. I owe that woman my life.

Several years later at 23 I bought a newer car used and was making payment on it, never missed a payment nor was I ever late on a payment. I had to have a cosigner since I didn't have credit. My parents tried that shit with that car and I told them ""if you take it from me then I'm going to stop paying the psyments, there's no sense in paying for something I'm not using. I have all the time in the world to financially recover from it but they would be screwed."" Stopped that shit in it's tracks again and it reminded them of their place in my life at my age.

Make sure they have no way of gaining access to it or the contents inside. Inside most safes they have holes in the bottom for you to be able to mark the floor drill holes and put concrete anchors in so you can't move the safe from that location. Honestly if I wasn't off work because of this shit thats goin around id buy you one and have it shipped to your house with a tracking number so you can be ready for its arrival and not have to worry about them seeing it.

depression,fnbx7px,t1_fnbay9n,1586824120.0,"I agree with you on the whole social media aspect. I quit all social media other than reddit, in fact that's when I made the move to reddit completely.  We all need to remember that NO ONE is really going to put the full truth about their lives and what's fully going on in them on any social media platforms.  Of course everyone is going to post the absolute best to boost their looks to everyone else. They aren't going to post that usually at work they don't make as much as they just did or that they made that much because they were able to work a shit load of over time or that they got all that money from a tax return or it's infact not their money. For example there was a kid on my news feed who always talked about his ""company/business"" that he owned and made it seem like he was a huge successful baller who bought his mom a big new house and bought his mom and sister brand new Mercedes benz's. He would post pics of stacks of money or pictures of him on high-rises in the downtown area like he was at an exclusive bar (which in fact anyone can get into). Turns out his successful business was in fact selling Chinese iPhone knockoffs and the cheap iPhone C's and those pics he posted took me 2 seconds to reverse Google and find out that he's taking these photos off Google images and posting then as his own. He would sell these knock offs for X amount and then block those customers so they couldn't comment and tell others that it was a scam. Point of the story is social media can be toxic and especially if youre comparing yourself and your life to people you see on there. 

I was in the same boat as you up until recently, I stopped going to all my social media profiles all together. It wasn't something that changed my mindset and attitude over night, it took a little bit but it did help absolutely! After I mastered not getting on any SM platforms I added/worked on something new in life to help and slowly added more or other things and I slowly got out of my depression/funk that I've been in for the past several years. My depression was brought on by the sudden passing of my father which hit me harder than I realized subconsciously. Hang in there and things will get better, try to also think more positively about things and try your best to not dwell on issues. They don't like you? Fuck em! Their loss not yours! 

If you need to talk to anyone about anything feel free to msg me.  We can talk about anything and I mean anything whether it's just to have a normal convo about the weather or just to see how each other are doing. I'm here and I'm all ears my friend. :) I'd be happy to have you as a friend."
insaneparents,fnbqrx5,t1_fn9wrvt,1586820477.0,"Well the thing is with her {and I can bet my life on it } that you could do whatever while living under her roof. Even if she ""kicks you out"" it wouldn't last long whatsoever. All you'd have to do would be ""ok! That's fine by me, such and such's parents or mom said I could live with them for a little bit while I get on my feet."" She would flip and not like that and you'd be basically calling her bluff. Even if she didn't crack instantly just stay at s friend's house for s day or so and not communicate with her. You could tell her as you leave that now there's no reason for you to keep in contact with her anymore. Call her bluff and from then on you'll have the control, she's only able to control you out of your fear, turn the tables on her, it's a psychological war. Do what needs to be done in order to win and put her in her place. Remind he you don't need her and that she's only in your life cause you allow her to be.

iamverybadass,fn9l6df,t1_fn8l1yh,1586777134.0,"I worked outside and when talking to people or listening id look around or off in the distance. I had made sure that my sunglasses lenses were so dark that they couldn't tell where I was looking even if my face was in the sun (I find Oakley's work amazing for the basically blacked out lenses). At times I'd stop listening too cause there would be something more interesting in the distance or I was thinking through something more Important than what they were saying or I just flat out didn't care about what they were saying.  I do this to people outside of work too. Most of the time it's cause I don't care about what someone is talking to me about and this helps from being rude or letting them know that everything they are saying is goin in one ear and out the other.

If you'd like to actually order food from us we are more than happy to help so stick with that instead of pranks. Thank you for your business"" . The manager shouldn't have gotten on to OP about this but handled the situation and possibly put an end to at least 1 pranker for good.

I find it insane that these big fortune 500 companies need to be bailed out even more especially right after getting bailout money for something else. These big companies need to start being able to survive on their own, I don't care if they're ""too big to fail"" obviously they're doing something wrong if they are failing and deserve to fail outright or struggle. Maybe then they will start managing their expenses and business a little better. If these massive companies can't keep their employees employed and paid during something like this then maybe they should reevaluate paying their management, CEO's etc huge sums or cutting those in order to keep their actual working employed, the ones who actually keep the business afloat and running, the life blood of the company if you will.

offmychest,fmza195,t3_fxxzkv,1586512364.0,"Just from the 2 responses you've posted, I and the others that say the same can see why you've been unsuccessful at dating. I see nothing wrong with dating black people, it's not for everyone and everyone has their own tastes but the way you're saying it comes off prejudice. I believe one thing you're not mentioning is that you probably have unbelievably high standards or expectations for a girlfriend. Wanting the world on a silver platter with them but giving and offering nothing in return to them. another is what I commented earlier, if you can't be happy with your own company you definitely can't expect anyone else to be. You also can't put how you behave onto other either, your trying to push that off onto others and doing anything you can to not take responsibility. Woman don't want that in a partner, they don't want to be in a relationship with a child let alone have children with a partner that acts and behaves like one. It's a major turn off for them.  
You've also skipped over some important things that don't really make sense like why you can't move out after saving money like you said. Another is your response on only being able to use woman you don't find attractive for dating, why do you think you'd be different with any others? If you're already willing to use them for just sex and as objects then what's to stop you from just doing it with ones you find ""acceptable"" to date?
