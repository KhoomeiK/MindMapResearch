textiles,fhngtaq,t3_etezp5,1581726585.0,"I've worked with a place that ordered large amounts of yarn (on spools) from a local mill. They could do custom colours but you had to order quite a large quantity. 

So I suggest checking out Google maps, see if there are any yarn mills near by. Even if it's in a nearby province/state. Give them an email and ask if they do custom dyeing. Also make sure they allow their yarn to be sold with your own labels because from our experience some mills didn't care and some it was a big NO.

There is no harm in asking, sending out a few emails or making a few phone calls. Eventually you will find what you're looking for. 

Good luck ! :)"
textiles,fhnfnwn,t3_f1lx4e,1581726117.0,"This would be helpful for me too.. I graduated a Textiles program in 2014 but still haven't found a decent job in the industry. Doh. It's probably just me though. I mean I do work in the industry but not making a living wage.

I can tell you what some of my peers have gone on to do: A few now work in the costume department for theatre and movies. some started their own business making and selling handmade goods. a few work for larger companies doing product design (digital), and a few continued to further their education at other universities. Also a couple have gone to to teaching type jobs, where they run workshops teaching about how to dye fabric and so on. 

Personally I think it's probably really important to have a good portfolio. To keep active in the community, networking. And I think one thing my program didn't touch on much that I wish they did was digital design. Most of the textile related jobs I see coming up when searching online, are all looking for people to do digital design using Adobe software. The program I was in focused almost entirely on physical process. Dye, print, weaving, ect.

craftit,fh4uh2p,t1_fh42eq2,1581282230.0,"There are a few ways to make a little loom depending on what materials you have available to you. The simplest way to make a mini loom is to cut a piece of stiff cardboard.  [like this](https://www.instructables.com/id/how-to-weave-on-a-cardboard-loom/).

But if you have some tools and wood available you can make a longer lasting loom, to whatever dimensions you prefer. [like this](https://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Easy-Loom/).

If you live near an art supply shop, you can usually buy pre-cut wood pieces meant for making frames for stretching canvas. You can glue or staple them together."

craftit,fh3ran0,t3_f1anlk,1581271569.0,"Have you tried weaving on a little loom? You can make some quite easily with an old frame and some nails. I like to use up old yarn scraps to weave little squares. You can use them as patches. 
I like using scraps in general.. making quilt squares is nice. Or one thing I've wanted to try is to use fabric scraps to make those braided rugs. Or you can also crochet with them. Cut into strips.
You may or may not also be interested in punch needle embroidery. Or rug hooking. 

Hmmm. Sorry I'm just kind of listing all kinds of things.

The other 10% is when he gets hyper and wants to play, I get scared and overwhelmed.  When he was a kitten I actually  cried a few times from being scared, which sounds funny now. But I can't help it when he trys to play bite I don't like it. As he grows older he has been chilling out more.
