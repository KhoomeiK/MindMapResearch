I was born into a religious cult called The Children of God and kept there by my family until I was 10. During this cult time I was abused physically, sexually and emotionally. From the age of 10 until I left home at 16, I was in an abusive environment due to my parents. The first relationship I was in at 17 was abusive, I left at 20. So with 20 years of abuse at that point, I sat down with a school counselor and they diagnosed me. I only went to a few sessions before I convinced myself I was fine. 

Flash forward 8 years and I realize that I've been avoiding the 20 years of abuse. Now at 28 I'm in a CPT program with a great counselor, started medication, have a support group and a psychiatrist that I see monthly to monitor my progress. 

It's really hard to go through the counseling. My headaches have been raging, my anxiety is soaring and my triggers are going buckwild. Even with all of that, I'm happy that I'm doing it. I'm going to trust the process and open up so that I can heal. We got this!"

The parents of the kids you saw on the street have access to these resources as they can research them at the library, go to a food shelter or even a church. Feel free to provide the information but please consider the fact that the parents chose to not do the research themselves. 

Seeing kids on the streets is hardly a casual observation. I think the mistake here is prioritizing the family unit, when it is truly the kids who are the priority. The kids need someone to report this. I was one of those homeless kids and I remember people coming up to my parents with ""resources"" and of course my parents would be gracious and accept the information but nothing changed at ""home"" for us.

Typically adults who raise their children on the streets without access to education have mental health issues and it is typically the exception that it is a financial concern. There is very little chance, in my opinion, that this is purely a financial issue based on the fact that the kids are not in school. If you struggling with finances but are mentally sound you'll enroll your kid so they can have access to food, education and possibly showers (gym/nurse).

Both my parents had mental health issues, my siblings and myself would have been better off if we were raised out of this environment."

I was raised in an family that was homeless so we begged for money, food, clothing and all necessities. Worst part is, we were actually members of a religious cult called the Children of God.

 You should always call the cops if you're concerned that a child is not getting their basic necessities met. If someone like you had called CPS for me as a kid a lot of trauma would have been avoided."

This is not your company, you're hired to represent the best interest of the owners. I've been a manager before so I can sympathize with you looking out for your employees and wanting to give someone a second chance. From a business perspective, I cannot imagine your boss being pleased that they were not given this information prior to employment. I find it to be highly unlikely that the owners would support you banning a paying customer from their store simply because a individual that has stalked them was hired by you. Living with the employee and having a prior personal relationship with their family makes it look even worse for you. 

In terms of the order of protection, why did you not request a copy of it before hiring him? In my state it's public record so you can access this information even without their knowledge/consent. I would ask for a copy ASAP. It is concerning that he has not provided it for you without you having to request it. Your neck is on the line here because you've done everything to help him and yet he has done nothing to protect you. 

In terms of her driving 40 mins out of the way, what is your source? Why haven't you considered the possibility that she has moved, is visiting someone or maybe has always lived in the vicinity of the store. Your employee has shown skewed judgment when it comes to this individual which, unfortunately, makes him the worst source possible. 

I'm all for second chances but you put your hands on this tar baby without doing your due diligence. 

Your employee must notify the court (there will be a fee) of his place of employment, you'll have better grounds to defend him once he has done this. Even if he does this, I suggest you contact upper management/the owners and act in good faith according to their wishes. Banning her seems like a PR nightmare that will cost you your job. What are you going to do if people show up in protest of her ban with signs and media? 

Best of luck!"
