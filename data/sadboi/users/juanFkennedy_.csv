worldpolitics,f5lxi8s,t1_f5hiq0f,1572284468.0,"Yeah nope. Socialism is bad. Free is NOT free. Please take a simple macro class. I’m assuming you are for other socialist policies...  Its honestly embarrassing how gullible everyone is thinking you can tax everyone even MORE to pay for free healthcare, free college, AND $15/hour minimum wage. 

I shouldn’t have to pay for someone else’s healthcare or college while my man and I worked hard for coverage and an education. 

Furthermore, if everyone has a degree this will negatively impact employment. The value of a 4 year degree has already decreased dramatically over the past 20-30 years because we keep pushing everyone to go to college when in reality it is not for everyone. There should be more importance placed on other career paths such as skilled trades. If everyone goes to college for “free” (paid by tax dollars) the value of a degree will go down to basically nothing. It would be kids graduating with a master’s or PhD and struggling to find work. Going to college is NOT a right. 

What about small business owners that can’t pay all their employees $15/hour? Did you ever think about them? 

I saw a job posting in my area that required a master’s degree and only paid $15.25. I am not going to school for 6 years to be paid the same as retail/service workers. That is absolutely asinine. 

Not to mention the drastic inflation we would see with this minimum wage. Yeah, it would help in cities with MILLIONS of people. But I’m in the midwest, where things are already comparatively cheap. How can you honestly say it’s better for a few cities to thrive while the rest of the flyover states suffer? 

Also? The European countries that socialist put on a pedestal? There is no minimum wage in Denmark, Finland, or Germany. 

Before you come at me “ur privileged!1!1” I grew up poor on reduced lunches with a single mother. I worked for everything I have just like my mom. 

Lastly, I cannot stress this enough. Take a macro class."

I’m not saying no one on the right ever does this, but I sure as hell don’t. I’d rather have a civil conversation with someone who disagrees with me.
