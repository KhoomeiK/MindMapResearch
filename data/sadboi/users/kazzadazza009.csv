From past experiences, I understand how hard it is once you're in that spiral, and you may feel like you have no one to talk to (and your therapist is a pos who isn't professional and quite frankly should be reported or smt), but there are people. Even if your family is mourning your family, they will want to talk to you, because they don't want to mourn you too. Reach out to them, tell them that you know the funeral has just happened but if you don't talk to someone, you feel you may be next; just be honest and you'll find that they won't be mad at you for taking over your aunts death, they'll want to help you, or help you get help. There are also specialist crises lines out there that you can call if you need to, not sure of where you're situated but there are plenty in the UK and US, so I'm sure there are more wherever you're from.

sugarfreemua,ex7v5ks,t1_ex7s9qb,1566065219.0,"When in doubt, I usually use different tones of peach on people, because I love the way peach gives a youthful look but not an extreme one. I would recommend  swatching a few different peachy shades, but I think if you look at the Sleek palette (cheap but a good one and you can get it in different countries) in [Lace](https://www.asos.com/sleek/sleek-makeup-blush-by-3-palette-lace/prd/9701579?channelref=product+search&mk=abc&currencyid=1&ppcadref=1736328628%7C66924751654%7Cpla-517753224703%26browseCountry%3DGB&affid=24743&channelref=product+search&mk=abc&ppcadref=1736328628%7C66924751654%7Cpla-517753224703&_cclid=Google_Cj0KCQjwy97qBRDoARIsAITONTJiCSgvk4F7BV8NKrVrjTkFuvPXg3ukJAo_Yn1CEtittrLj5VXyIUsaAmt8EALw_wcB&gclid=Cj0KCQjwy97qBRDoARIsAITONTJiCSgvk4F7BV8NKrVrjTkFuvPXg3ukJAo_Yn1CEtittrLj5VXyIUsaAmt8EALw_wcB), the last shade, the lighter peach one would suit you. But this is completely just from looking at your picture.

The lip colour doesn't have to one you'll wear on its own, but purely to give your lips some depth under lipglosses such as a nyx one you have on."
sugarfreemua,ex7r9i3,t1_ewcnfhi,1566063838.0,"When in doubt, use masking or mua tape! Just like if you were to apply your eyeshadow, stick your tape along the line where you'd like your eyeliner to go and then do the same on the other side. Alternatively, you could try the spoon trick although I'm not sure how well that works.

With liquid eyeliner, I usually draw a dot with a white or nude liner to where I want it to end, then I match up on the other side. I then draw a line to the dot, do my eyelid, and join them together."
sugarfreemua,ex7qdaw,t3_cnqxp9,1566063522.0,"I agree with the other comment on your eyebrows, it's hard to see them if you have your glasses on. 

Also, I would probably recommend using a lip liner or lipstick all over your lips in a shade similar to your own or a little bit darker, just because right now with the duo-chromatic lip gloss, your lips in this picture are blending in with your skin. By adding some colour around your lips, it'll give you a nice shape in a similar shade to yourself, and then the duo-chromatic lip gloss would look better. Last thing, I would probably suggest using some light coverage blush (perhaps a pressed brush followed by tapping your brush to get the excess product off, or a little bit of a cream blush),  this would give your face some depth and a nicer glow. 

I think your foundation looks great here, it covers well and it matches really well too. I can't comment on your eyes or eyebrows due to the glasses."
sugarfreemua,ex7p4n4,t3_co7e42,1566063076.0,"You've got really nice skin in the before, so I reckon the light coverage foundation really works for you. The blush gives you a nice, youthful glow. Generally, this is a good look for you. The only thing you could do, but don't necessarily have to; you could use a black pencil line in the top water line, this would just give you some extra thickness in your top lashes unless you prefer the lighter look!"
sugarfreemua,ex7nr9c,t3_cr9eh0,1566062593.0,"The picture is a bit unclear however it looks like you're having some difficulty blending, could it be because of the base underneath your shadow? Are you using a good \[eye\] primer? I like to put some concealor on top of my primer, blend that out and then finish it with a nude or a white base blended out which creates a smooth canvas to work on which will help you blend out. From experience working with slightly older people or even people with a bit more wrinkly eyelids, I find that once i complete my base, it might be easier to stretch the side you're working on to get a smooth application. As a side note as well, I would steer away from going to the top of your eyebrow with a colour shadow unless you intend for that. Your eyes already have some hood so by going all the way to the top, it alost gives them more hooded look whereas if you leave some space, it'll create an illusion of a larger surface area.

For your mascara, I would suggest curling your eyelashes with a curler (super cheap online or in any drugstore shop near you, just put the curler at the base of your lashes without catching you skin and press firmly about 6-8 times), then go to apply your mascara from the root of your lashes by creating almost a zigzag motion going up, this will give you an even coverage. 

Overall, I like the colours together.

Hope this helps."

askwomenadvice,eplvjfg,t3_bv4cbi,1559304347.0,"why has no one mentioned how toxic is the idea that he “refuses to wear condoms”???? why should you be put through the emotional trauma from the pill and have all your hormones messed about because he “refuses to wear condoms”, this is such a toxic idea and tbh i think you need to stand your ground and just tell him that 1, it’s not fair he made you go on the pill and now isn’t having sex and 2. get off the pill if it doesn’t agree with you and just say that if he doesn’t compromise then that’s not good enough for you and also 3. the pill isn’t 100% so you should still wear a condom. Find yourself a more mature guy"
