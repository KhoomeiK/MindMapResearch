UniUK,fq9elz7,t1_fq5tsmy,1589195735.0,"I had to use online lectures at the beginning of the pandemic, whilst the healthy students could still attend. It didn't put me at a disadvantage at all, I could still ask questions, I could still interact with other students when I needed to, and I could still speak to the lecturer afterwards if I wanted to.

Having fewer people take the lecture online actually improves the experience for those who do because their questions are more likely to be seen (much like how being in a lecture hall with fewer people makes your question more likely to be seen)

I think if they are able to provide in person lectures safely for some students then there is no problem with it. Whether or not they'll be able to do it safely is another issue though."

There have been cases of 111 (no emergency health advice in the UK) telling people they're fine and don't have it, despite showing the symptoms that would warrant self isolating.

Unless we take fast and aggressive action now, the most vulnerable people in our society are going to be affected in both the long and short term.

We went to the same university and so I told my personal tutor and disability advisor what was going on so that they could keep an eye out for any indications that my mental health was getting severely affected.

She then reported me to the university saying I was blackmailing her, and so I had to have a meeting with some senior members of staff about whether I'd be banned from the side of campus that contains her halls of residence. I explained **everything** and they decided I obviously hadn't blackmailed her, but they also didn't ask me if I felt safe or if I wanted anything done. The fact that she had sexually assaulted me, stalked me, and then filed a false report about me didn't seem to bother them... They just suggested I avoid her."
