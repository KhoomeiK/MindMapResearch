Let me just say that I don’t believe I am recovered. I am not sure if there is such a thing. But I do like to think I am learning enough to be able to live with my BPD. Hand in hand. It’s not easy. It’s work. A lot of it. I am trying. To the best of my abilities that is, to stay healthy mentally as well as physically. 
I also know I have support and tools to help guide me through this. It took 26 years before I even knew why I saw the world the way I did. 
Keep going. Keep trying. Open mind, open eyes, and open heart. 
Good luck friend."
BPD,fqu641q,t1_fqu1afz,1589652754.0,"Possibly because mental health experts can argue otherwise. 
Not many people have an open mindset to have these discussions. I may not agree with you but I don’t have to be rude. We each have our own way of thinking. And I believe most of us here do see this as a disorder. 
Our brains have been changed in a way that makes us think much differently that someone without BPD. 
I also really advice you to look into DBT therapy. There’s plenty of books that explain it very well. 
You don’t really lose much in trying things. 
If you still don’t feel satisfied that’s perfectly okay. 
Don’t take the downvotes personal."

But he will come home and cry to me, telling me how no one will be his friend and no one plays with him.
And other side of the story is that his teacher has to force him to socialize. That if one student makes a small comment that in whatever which way might relate to him he will automatically shut down, he will not want anyone’s help. He won’t want to play with anyone or won’t want to join in on the activity. 
We do our best to make sure we include him with anything and everything but the times he does shut down and does not allow anyone in is when we don’t really know what to do. We want to help, we want to make him happy but how do we do that when he rejects our help? We he refuses to be included? So many questions.

I recall my after visit summary always just having a long list stating I had anxiety, chronic depression, etc....
But never would he make a reference to BPD. 
 He was an older man, I’m assuming because the younger gen doctors aren’t as close minded? and I believe they don’t see the negative grey cloud stigma  that old “timers” do? 
Or maybe that was just his weird way of avoiding it.

I am very sorry your parents did not believe in mental health. Mine were the same. Until a few years ago. And my mother is now very much into watching Ted talks about anything mental health related.
