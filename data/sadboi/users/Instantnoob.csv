BPD,fo7mr1t,t3_g61u5j,1587580988.0,"Before I knew what BPD was I identified this FP thing with my gf at the time who was realizing how toxic and manipulative their relationship with them was and smoothly transitioned to me. I had identified dependency and fear of abandonment as huge factors in her mental health so I spent almost all my time with her mitigating my FP status. Telling her I'd be there but that she didn't need me to be herself. Making sure she never had to censor herself because nothing she could say would change how I felt about her, and nothing she did couldn't be forgiven. I never wanted our relationship to be so fragile that it was a source of stress for her. 

But in the end I think we just fizzled out, which not a common way for FP relationships to end. We're usually demonized and enthusiastically rejected. And I think I fizzled away from her interest because I didn't do enough for her. Like when you leave, you dont want to hurt people you care about but as bad as it sounds, you want people to miss you, because it shows they care. I think maybe I didn't show I cared enough with my worry or wasn't as clingy as she needed from a FP.

But we still talk sometimes as distant friends because of it. That's a lot more than you can ask of most BPD fallouts.

Edit: I saw from another post a feeling that might explain what happened. I guess sometimes you get bored of healthy relationships."
BPD,fo7kk4q,t1_fo2bb9c,1587579906.0,"I've had 2 girlfriends with BPD. I don't disparage them even though it obviously didn't work out after they each finally pushed me away completely, but the only reason they worked for as long as they did was that I knew if I gently stayed and showed I still cared while allowing their distance until the switch flipped again, the paranoia would go away and we could be happy for a little longer. A few more days or weeks or even months till the next episode and it was time to rebuild again. Even though I knew it wouldn't last, I thought they deserved a relationship that could last at least a few big meltdowns just to have a taste of normal."
