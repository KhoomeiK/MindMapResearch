But seriously, I know how you feel. It can be annoying to hear the same advise repeated ad naseum. I was addicted to opiates for a long time and heard ""you have to really want to be sober"" about a million times. It never made sense until I finally was at the point where I truly did want to quit. So basically, it didn't make sense until it did. Which is annoying af because it meant I had to wait for it. And waiting is not something I am good at!"

SuicideWatch,flby0m8,t3_fnw2a8,1585015250.0,"Mine started like that (about a year ago). From then til about a month ago it was pretty infrequent and distant. A month ago it ramped up to start being disturbing. Mine is simply ""I want to die"" over and over, like a fucking meditation mantra. About 2 weeks ago I lost my job (chemist as well). Since then the thoughts have gone from intrusive unrealistic thoughts with no plan, to thoughts with active planning. Today j stared at a metal bar about 20 ft off the ground and imagined jumping off it to hang myself. It was kinda sad but pleasant to think about at the same time.  

I'm not sure how much debt you have, but if you can start paying it down that'll def help cause it seems like it's the main cause of your distress. People do horrible things when they get into a lot of debt (violence, etc) cause of how much stress it causes. 

But ya it seems like you are at the beginning stages with the ideation and if things get worse it could turn into planning. 

Also, about the ADHD meds. I abused amphetamines for some years and it definitely had a negative effect on my mental health. But if you're taking as prescribed you're probably ok. Just my 2 cents."
