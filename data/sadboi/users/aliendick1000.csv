shadowofmordor,fe3hkip,t3_emjoqv,1578849345.0,Tbh I think it’s a little butchered but most of it is still possible. Idk why but MILF Shelob just makes no sense to me though.
shadowofmordor,fe3h076,t3_emffqu,1578849168.0,This is so innocent I-

Dragula,fdk7cfz,t1_fcxg7vs,1578497739.0,I agree! Also the way they talk to the queens and give them critiques melts my heart. Not something I ever expected from a horror/gore show.
shadowofmordor,fd2t4h9,t3_ehxjrl,1578151366.0,Mad respect

Dragula,fcwtg45,t1_fcwt290,1578036907.0,Yeah I think that was it. Really sad to watch 😩
shadowofmordor,fcvm01d,t1_fcvkftf,1578004975.0,Yeah that’s what I noticed too. Not gonna lie running around and just killing or branding orcs is my fave activity.
shadowofmordor,fcvhli3,t1_fcvgpdr,1578002254.0,Oh no that sucks. I’m definitely having a lot of fun playing it but it’s just something I didn’t expect. It really bothered me at first but not anymore. I was just wondering if it was fixable
shadowofmordor,fcvhegf,t1_fcvd5qt,1578002138.0,I’m playing on PC so I’ll check that out thank you!

Dragula,fcuug89,t1_fcutxd8,1577988741.0,"Lmao it’s just a meme, I definitely enjoy both shows and I’m not saying you should enjoy the other anymore or bash the other. They’re both different anyway. Sadly I mainly watch drag race only because I wanna see and support different kinds of drag queens. However, after watching Dragula you can really tell the difference in who cares about the community and drag in general more. The production, creativity and acceptance all makes me more attracted to Dragula. Kinda makes me see RuPaul in a different light."
rupaulsdragrace,fcosqov,t1_fbhl7t4,1577840530.0,Lmao it was cringy af but she’s adorable and seems really nice. Did I cringe when she did that little roar but I also fell in love with her adorable ass. People just stay pressed for no reason.

The apartheid walk is literally illegal by the UN and the Geneva convention as is globally recognized as illegal (You can research this on your own too I’m not here to baby sit your apartheid apologist ass). Nice try Zionist.

Maybe if you can’t read the news or see what has been going on, at least this will give you a small insight. Next time I would suggest at least doing some research before you say something had never happened when it routinely does. Please do tell how all of these aren’t both war crimes and crimes against basic human rights. The world is catching on and finally seeing Israel’s war crimes for what they are, and nothing will spare Israel when their time comes. Oh also your prime minister is going straight to hell."
