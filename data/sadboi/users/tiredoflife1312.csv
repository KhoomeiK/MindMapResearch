You don‚Äôt even have to like yourself to love or be in a relationship with someone else. It might help a little, but it‚Äôs definitely not a prerequisite AT ALL. This idea of having to be completely put together in order to be able to talk to a member of the opposite sex or enter a relationship is totally ludicrous. Almost all of us are warped and broken and misshapen, it‚Äôs about putting puzzle pieces together. That‚Äôs the conclusion I‚Äôve come to.

zoloft,faiuvos,t1_faim3yf,1576117168.0,Honestly if you work that much I‚Äôd recommend starting when you have a bit of time to relax and let the side effects happen without fucking you up too much. It‚Äôs different for everyone and I don‚Äôt know what your main problem is but for me after day 7 my depression got way worse and I have basically been in bed this past week. It‚Äôs only just starting to lift at around day 16. It needs at least a month to fully kick in and often gets worse before it gets better so bear that in mind and plan accordingly!

Sure there‚Äôs nuance to ghosting. If you feel like you‚Äôre in danger or someone can harm you then by all means ghost. But in 95% of cases a simple message saying look I just don‚Äôt really want to continue talking/seeing you or whatever is more than enough. You don‚Äôt necessarily have to give an explanation, just that is better than disappearing out of the blue like a fucking thief in the night.

And in the case of what if you‚Äôre not as attractive as the other guy, honestly I‚Äôd rather hear the hard truth because then I have something I can use to build and be better, but an unknown cloud of ghosting hanging over you just fucks with the mind waaaaay more than a hard pill to swallow does."

it really hurts, doesn't it? the only thing i can really think of right now is to get a massage (non happy ending lol), which im planning on doing in the next few weeks. i guess forming more affectionate and deep freindships is a good idea.. but like i mentioned i don't know how much it would help. i mean, i do get platonic hugs, they just always only last like a second or two and are never enough. i do have 2 online friends who are female that i talk to and that feels pretty affectionate, although it sucks because one of them i wanted more from, im scared that if i try to get my feeling of deep connection from them i'll inevitably want more and end up feeling more lonely, not to mention its not IRL. i honestly don't know. maybe i could just try and hang out with female friends and not want anything from them, but that feels really hard for me to do, especially if they're remotely attractive. the only thing that has seemed to work in the past is keeping stupidly busy. meeting as many people as possible, connecting with old friends, maybe the odd smoke sesh or two, i miss that. im getting more free time soon so that might be feasible for me, whereas before i was trning down invite after invite because i had to make ends meet."
