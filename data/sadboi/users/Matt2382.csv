computers,fpstrhw,t3_gfaf96,1588879482.0,It‚Äôs probably the lcd you‚Äôll have to replace it. If the computer is running Windows 7 consider upgrading it to 10 for free.
teenagers,fppuu8j,t1_fppu8uf,1588809597.0,Ive tried thinking of other stuff and working on myself. I was depressed for years and now that I‚Äôve finally got out of it I‚Äôve been trying to work on myself but i still have the thoughts. When the quarantine ends and I can get back out again I can maybe work on myself more. Thanks for your advice it‚Äôs been really helpful!

You can reuse the 7 key to activate it again. Maybe try windows10. But if that‚Äôs your main pc I‚Äôd just get a new one

computers,fj0oc1l,t1_fj0kfxq,1582904402.0,No it doesn‚Äôt 99.9% of computers will recognize any ssd. On a occasion it might not read it but that‚Äôs rare. What I meant by transfer your data is someone could literally copy your whole drive to the new ssd which idk how to do. If you did just backup your files you‚Äôd have to reinstall windows. If you know how to do that it should be all good.
computers,fj0o65h,t1_fj0ko6t,1582904306.0,You could.. I don‚Äôt see the point of doing it though. The battery will die quicker and possibly could inflate but it most likely won‚Äôt.
computers,fj0ixwn,t1_fj0ikfn,1582901049.0,"Ok, this same thing happened to me, the hard drive over time just gets very slow. The 7200rpm hdd is usually speedy at the beginning but slows down over time, it even could possibly be dying. The hardware looks good so you dont have to get a new laptop if you don‚Äôt want to but you should replace the hard drive with a 500gb or 1tb ssd. A 500gb ssd on Amazon is 80$ and a 1tb is $150. I‚Äôd recommend replacing it. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable replacing it you could always bring it to a computer shop and ask them to do a replacement (they‚Äôd order the part and maybe speed up the pc without replacing the part, I‚Äôm not a professional but I think replacing it would only be the right choice.) also they‚Äôd transfer your data between the drives which you probably don‚Äôt know how to do."
