ForeverAlone,fpclpiw,t3_gcm4ls,1588505229.0,"Yes. And I think it sufficiently screwed me up for life.  

It's a VERY long story but the skinny of it is a girl reached out to me and after a few weeks of messaging back and forth it became apparent she was very into me, and I her. She was the first and so far only girl to tell me I was handsome and call me gorgeous and tell me she dreamt about me and imagined us together (a lot of which was very physical in nature). 

Mind you when this all happened I was about 6 months away from turning 30 and becoming a wizard.

She visited for a week to see if we gelled in real life as much as we did online and needless to say it was the absolute best and worst week I've had in my life up till now.... I took something absolutely amazing (we cuddled and kissed and slept together) and completely fucked it all up by being me. I was too inside my head and squeezed the life out of a possible relationship before it even got started somehow knowing this was my one and only opportunity and I dashed it all to pieces. 

I know it all came down to my (at the time undiagnosed) ASD and all the messed up things that travel with it that caused her to pull away and distance herself up until the day she had to leave; And on that day I basically was a crying mess from the time I woke up to the time I went to bed. 

Looking back I know what I did wrong and all I can do is the mature thing and try to learn from my mistakes. I feel like I've grown and matured somewhat emotionally in the almost 4 years since that event thanks to therapy and counseling but I still feel like it was my one and only shot and I will never get another one as long as I live and be given a chance to redeem myself and prove myself a good boyfriend for someone.

But I think if I were to die right now and that was the only time in my life I was able to experience being with a girl physically then I guess I have no choice and will make peace with it; some people don't even get **that** in their lives and I'm grateful it happened.

I barely make ends meet with a part time job I don't really like but need to keep because I can't see myself doing any better, my self-esteem is terrible (I'll routinely mime killing myself to others like I did this morning at work) and I lack any form of traditional charisma and have a hard time with basic eye contact, every time I try to imagine having sex with a beautiful girl (or even a decent make-out session) I start to panic a little, I don't feel like an adult emotionally; more like a teen and I think everyone sees me as such and don't ever take me seriously, I tend to get so darn wrapped up in my own thoughts and imagine the worst possible outcome for everything in my life, I either have a problem of lacking empathy for someone or becoming too emotionally fragile and can be reduced to tears over anything, I don't like big groups of people and generally prefer one-on-one interactions while enjoying people in ""short bursts"", opting to need my alone time frequently throughout the day.

I'm a mediocre person all around and I could type out all my ""problems"" and ""issues"" till my fingers fall off but I know no one would give a flying fuck.

To start, she had a habit of emptying your desk if she thought it was messy except our desks didn't have the top flip up, we just had the middle hollowed out. Her rule was that when she asked you to get out your math book, for example, and you didn't do it in the time frame she expected, she assumed it was messy and would march over, tip the desk out at your feet and continue with her lesson leaving you there to clean up the mess while everyone in the class stares at you.

Happened to me at least twice. 

Another instance was she made it a habit of announcing grades on homework/tests in front of *everyone* and SO many times I would get to hear out loud, ""And Bobby_Fingers... F!"" and make a showing of either ostentatiously handing you the paper or making you walk TO HER in the front of the class to grab it. I was a crap student and always getting picked on so to have to do this on an almost weekly basis was humiliating.

One instance was we had to check out a book from the library and (my memory is really fuzzy) read a certain amount for a reading assignment, or something like that. I grabbed a big orange book on hurricanes and brought it to her which she admonished me for saying that it was too hard for me to read. I said no it wasn't so she told me to start reading it in front of her; every word I stumbled over she would raise a finger and when she got to 5 (which apparently was pretty quick) she told me she *knew* it was too difficult and to go put the book back and get something else.

One more was when one of my classmates was standing on a chair to grab something, she told her, ""If you fall off and crack your head open I'm not cleaning up the blood!"""

People say you need to be happy with yourself and your life before you try and invite someone else in or you may end up using them as an emotional crutch but I personally think I would honestly be so much more happier and feel like my life would mean something beyond my lame job and empty apartment and basic hobbies and minimal education and my ASD if I had a GF and... if that kind of thinking is me being selfish, then I guess I'm f-ing selfish then; Just once in my life I'd like to think of *myself* and not be made to feel like crap for doing so like everyone else in the world somehow can get away with except for us."

It's how I feel about extraterrestrials elsewhere in the Universe: Due to the absolute sheer number of galaxies and stars and planets orbiting those stars out there and how large our lone universe is (never mind the fact this could be one of dozens or more), it would be unwise to assume there isn't a planet out there that couldn't harbor intelligent life like us but due to size and numbers, we'd most likely never know of each other's existence...

I was actually contemplating using the Coronavirus as an excuse to now show up but I knew that family I hadn't seen in ages would be there and it wouldn't be fair if I at least didn't show my face.

I stayed a lot longer than I was planning and at least they had live music so I was obviously enamored more with that than socializing, but it wouldn't do much good due to how loud it was and it frustrates me to no end trying to talk to someone and basically shout everything. Plus the volume did nothing to help my tinnitus. 

I know my ASD and general aloofness makes it tough for me in social situations, even with close family and I sometimes will not really think before I say something but one event that day really made me feel like crap and it's been weighing on my mind ever since. So naturally my dad asked me how I was while he was tending bar and without even thinking I went to my default saying and said ""Not dead yet!"" thinking I was trying to be funny cause I say it all the time. All he did was shake his head in a ""WTF?!"" gesture, smirked and then turned his back on me and refused to acknowledge me the rest of the time I was there; even when I said I was leaving he just smiled at me and didn't even say bye. 

I know it shouldn't bother me since I'm so used to this kind of thing between us but I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt my feelings.

**Maybe** if I ever find love it'll be when I'm past middle age... and that's a big maybe. I'm not hopeful for the future in terms of my employment, possible retirement, social upward mobility, friendship status and financial stability because what I have right now is about as good as it's ever going to get and I'll be working till I drop dead from a coronary.

I'm not really familiar with what kind of education/training a programmer needs so excuse my ignorance with the profession) but the only thing I wouldn't be able to handle is sitting in front of a computer for hours and hours. I **have** to always be moving; I can't sit still for any extended period of time.
ForeverAlone,fignpii,t1_fieqyek,1582401812.0,"I'm listed as an ""Ops Admin"" for a shipping company which sounds MUCH more important than it actually is. I basically walk around doing repacks, relabels and retapes of damaged packages before they go out for delivery in a loud, dusty, cold (or hot depending on the time of year) warehouse as well as fixing bad addresses, calling people to set up ""alternate"" delivery arrangements and getting yelled/bitched at by customers for things outside of our control or from the mistakes of other people."
ForeverAlone,fieq6y0,t1_fie5e1a,1582381483.0,"> I still feel unhappy sometimes

I know brother. Depression (or depressive feelings in general) can be a bitch sometimes. As miserable as I feel most days at my job, I honestly can't afford to lose it so I try and watch my P's and Q's and I keep in mind that my real happiness comes from what I do outside of my menial job. What is it that you do, if I may ask?"
ForeverAlone,fiepkh6,t1_fibpl61,1582381282.0,"Thank you. :)

Not the first time this has happened and it certainly won't be the last. I guess I'll just keep plugging away at where I'm at now and if something else tantalizing opens up at our station I'll apply for that one too. 

I mean, they have to *at least* notice the amount of times I've applied for higher positions over the years so I hope that it's a sign to them that I want to do more and move up."
ForeverAlone,fieovrq,t1_fibzcwl,1582381041.0,"> I guess it's who you know more often than not.

One of the unwritten rules of life, unfortunately. But it's not like I'm not used to being passed over for others concerning jobs. I'll just keep plugging away and if something else opens up at the station, I'll at least throw my hat in the ring again."
ForeverAlone,fidjcu4,t3_f7o9wq,1582367716.0,I'd like to think so but until I find myself in a situation where I'm someones honest to God boyfriend I'll never truly know.
ForeverAlone,fidj5wp,t3_f7o2lr,1582367626.0,32 here and so far... all signs point to no. But that's simply my situation. I'm sure making real friends (and not just having oodles of acquaintances) and dating are possible at really any age but for me I don't think either one of those things will happen unless I make them happen and in all honesty I'm not going to. Especially when it comes to dating.
depression,fibdk9l,t3_exo6f1,1582319717.0,"Ugh. Applied for a part time HR position last week, and while my pessimism told me over and over I wouldn't get it, when I saw the missed call and voicemail on my phone I got a small twinge of hope that *maaaaybe* I had gotten it.  Nope. Went to someone else. That's position number 7 I've applied to at the company over the years and didn't get. I lose again; story of my life."
