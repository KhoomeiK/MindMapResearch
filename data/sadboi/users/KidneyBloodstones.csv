skyrim,fqf5xy6,t3_eb595p,1589319260.0,"So I just got Skyrim and started playing it. Level 5 now. I tried to speak with a shopkeeper in Riverwood and accidentally stole off his counter. The guard captain comes in and I can't pay a fine, he just tried to kill me. I ""kill"" him, but he gets restored to full health and keeps limping toward me full of arrows. The shopkeeper is cool, but I need to enter a building elsewhere in the village for a quest. All the villagers are at the attacking me with knives and I can't enter. I've escaped and returned multiple times but they're always angry. Is there anything I can do to not make people hate me? This was supposed to be my good character lol

Tl;dr how can I not be internationally hated anymore?"
ZeldaBotW,fqeus1j,t1_fqe5o5z,1589313935.0,"I suppose, but ""most of the map"" isn't ""explored every nook and cranny looking for all the bosses to complete my boss medals, grab all Korok seeds, etc."" I'd argue for the majority of people that didn't do that before beating Ganon, the motorcycle is fantastic. If you did it before getting the motorcycle, I don't know why, but whatever that's cool.

I do feel like there could have been better things added in the dlc though, especially since it's 1/3 the price of the original game and we got much less than that in content"
ZeldaBotW,fqeu9yx,t1_fqei7nw,1589313695.0,"Can't tell if sarcastic or not (Reddit scarred me lol) but the game definitely feels open world heavy and content light.

ZeldaBotW,fqe5ic5,t1_fqbt9k5,1589302084.0,"If you're into exploration like many are, the motorcycle is a godsend. It's so much quicker to mount, handles better, and jumps over terrain that horses are scared of"
ZeldaBotW,fqe5ab8,t1_fqcgjuh,1589301979.0,"Plenty of games have optional side quests that only unlock after you beat the main storyline. Tons of possibilities for endgame. Side bad guy absorbs residual power from Ganon and becomes new optional hard boss that actually proves a challenge. As previously mentioned in this thread, you could have cleanup missions to kill bad guys or clean up the liquid Malice like Mario Sunshine. Help the Bolson company rebuild cities like Castle Town which unlocks mini games etc and more trading chains to get you great stuff.

Upgrades-wise, I found much of it lacking. When the endgame is all about exploration, I'd prefer more ""endgame upgrades"" that focus on making that more enjoyable. Permanent character upgrades to climbing/swimming (climbing in the rain is always mentioned) that doesn't rely on armor swapping. Tbh just making the armor a skin instead of a power would be ideal. Maybe have these bonuses in rings you wear so you do have to choose, but can have more at once and enjoy the armor look you want

Woah tangent"
