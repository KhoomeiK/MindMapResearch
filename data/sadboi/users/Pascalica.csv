AskReddit,fr0b79a,t3_gln8tu,1589789550.0,"I got sick at the very end of January and was sick until about the 18th of February before I started feeling moderately human again. When it started it it was so weird, because I got cold, and felt cold to the touch. The same thing happened with my son. Then I got hit with a bad fever, and a dry cough, I'm not sure I've ever sweated so much in my life. I've never had a dry cough before, my lungs are bad and generally if something hits my lungs I'm coughing up phlegm for weeks afterward, but not this time. I had a lingering cough for months after though.

At the time I really started to worry that it might kill me, I didn't have the horrible shortness of breath like some people had, but I had it a little, and I felt so weak that it was an effort just to get up to go to the bathroom and back. I barely wanted to eat, and everything that I did eat tasted strange. I didn't completely lose my sense of taste, but it was like it was dulled, nothing tasted right.

Everyone told me at first it couldn't be Covid given how early I had it, but now that more and more cases are being found early, it makes me more certain that I did have it. Hopefully we will eventually have an antibody test available here soon."

Your mental health has to come first for yourself, and if supporting her right now is a detriment to you, taking a break is probably wise. It doesn't have to be forever, but you likely need some space to heal, and if she's your actual friend she'll allow you to take it. 

Does your best friend know about your feelings for this woman? Does he have feelings for her? Is this something that you can talk to him about at all?

I'm tired of how things are too, but we need to find a way to make it better other than by blowing things up. I'm furious at the suffering, I'm furious that M4A isn't a thing, that social safety nets are blamed for national debts but the endless war machine has a bottomless pocketbook. We NEED people to be furious, everyone needs to be furious, and we need to start holding every politicians feet to the fucking fire so they work for US and not the corporations. We will *never* do that with Trump in office, and with a republican congress backing him. Not ever. I don't know how to get us there, but I can't get behind another 4 years of Trump being the answer because I'm not sure we survive that.

Edit: And it's definitely about more than who holds the office of President.

AskReddit,fnvb42m,t3_g3xrji,1587286646.0,"My 5th grade teacher tortured me. I have a lot of stories of abuse from her class, but these are a few.

My family was incredibly poor, so money was always a stress at home. I was painfully aware of this by the 5th grade. So one day a bunch of us were messing around at lunch, pretending to throw food at one another, but never actually doing it. I foolishly had mustard in one of those flimsy plastic spoons and acted as though I was going to launch it at a friend. It slipped and splattered him with mustard. My teacher made a huge deal of it in front of the class, then made me swear in front of the class that I would pay to clean the coat, or personally replace it if the stains didn't come out. Knowing that we were horribly poor. I was so stressed about this I was bawling in class, and sick, because I was afraid I'd just cost my family a ton of money. I never heard about it again though, so i guess they got the mustard out.

In that 5th grade class, I never got to go on field trips. There were always reasons made up for why, but it was always me, and I was usually the only one. This usually meant I had to sit in the office alone doing school work while my class was out doing whatever the field trip was. One day no one came in and informed me it was time for lunch, by that point I was terrified to do anything without permission so I just kept sitting there forgotten. When my class returned, I asked if I could get something to eat because I was hungry. My teacher -- in front of another teacher I was sometimes with a couple hours a week -- told me if I was too stupid to get lunch, I could just wait. The other teacher tried to offer me some milk and crackers, but I was so beaten down at that point that i refused them and just sat in class hungry the rest of the day.

Once, in doing a math exercise that involved standing up and trying to solve a multiplication problem faster than one other classmate, I actually got one right first. The teacher paused the entire game and told the class to applaud me because I actually got a problem right, for once.

Another instance -- still 5th grade -- was to do with a book report. I'm dyslexic, and in the 5th grade I hadn't learned any coping skills to deal with it, so reading and writing were hard for me. The teacher knew about my dyslexia and did not care in the slightest. I turned in a book report, she glanced at it, announced to the class that it was crap, and threw it at me.

This was all the same teacher, she just seemed to derive a sick pleasure in making my life an absolute hell. I don't understand why to this day, I was a very quiet kid, I rarely caused any sort of trouble, I was just poor with a learning disability, and that seemed to be enough to make her want to make my life a living hell for a year. I've never been so happy to get away from a teacher, and it really ruined any joy I had in school after that."

My mother was not kind, or supportive. She was a baptist Christian, so there was a lot of unkind, harsh things said that stick with me to this day, many, many years later. What I wanted and needed most was just someone who would be kind, even though I made a mistake, and support me through what was a very terrifying time. Be that for her if you can."

AmItheAsshole,fnkhbrz,t1_fnji6he,1587027059.0,"Or the fact that men generally earn more, so financially it makes more sense for men to work for a lot of families. 

Or that daycare is obscenely expensive and often makes the benefits of a two income household less appealing. Or the guilt women often have foisted upon them if they choose to work. Stfu with this women are stupid nonsense. The game has been rigged since time immemorial, and though it's better, it's still rigged."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fngs195,t1_fnfjvi0,1586942814.0,"I just read a story last week that a lot of it isn't actually due to hoarding. Some of it is, obviously, there are some jackasses out there, but a big part of the issue is that people are just going to the bathroom at home more. The toilet paper industry is set up to make exactly as much TP as is needed, and not really more, their factories operate 24/7 to make that amount, more or less. People aren't going at work, or at restaurants, or in stores as often, which has stressed the home TP industry. The commercial TP industry, on the other hand, is suffering because far fewer people need that right now, but they're made at entirely different factories by different companies, and they aren't set up to sell to residential customers. So basically it's stupid people, but also an industry that does a balancing act to be profitable that was set off kilter by a pandemic."
AmItheAsshole,fngr7xy,t1_fngjmmp,1586941952.0,"Over the age of three? Are you kidding me?? An infant is far easier to deal with than a mobile young child who is curious, and has absolutely no sense of self-preservation. It basically doesn't get that much easier until they're like 8, then you can breathe a little, then they start with that whole hormones thing and it's another wild ride until they're legally an adult and you aren't responsible for their actions anymore.

Editing to add: Being a full time parent is 24/7, you are always on the clock, always responsible for the kids. Even when they're ""entertaining themselves"" you have to be there. You have to be present, and of a mind enough to take care of them, and in all that downtime you can do laundry, and cook, and clean, then you feed everyone, then it's more cleaning, then baths, then bed, then maybe you get maybe an hour, often filled with other household stuff, then you try to sleep and hope they don't wake you up in the night. You get some sleep, often less than you need, and you start it over again. You do this 7 days a week, there are no days off, there is no vacation, there are no sick days. Stop devaluing the literal never ending work that many stay at home parents do."

AskReddit,fnepiaq,t1_fnelvz3,1586893542.0,"Ownership of photos is something that is pretty well hashed out. Things like facebook have to sneak it into the user agreements that they're allowed to use your photos for things like advertising purposes. It's unlikely Buzzfeed has any such agreement most people though, but most people don't care, or don't bother doing anything about it, because what can the average person do against the team of Buzzfeed lawyers?"
