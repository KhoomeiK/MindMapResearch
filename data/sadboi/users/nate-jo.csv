My advice is just try not to make up reasons that might not be true, even though that’s hard cause I did for sure. I still hurt over it but time makes it so much better. Best you can do is work on yourself to avoid a repeat situation, and let time do it’s thing. Hope you have a productive healing period friend."

Losing friends was hard at first but tbh things go better with dpdr with a minimalist social life. I still feel love for people and I am aware they love me, it just gets hard when things you desperately want deep down just can’t seem to give you the energy / pressure you need to process things in a meaningful way. Like for instance I wouldn’t say I don’t “feel” anything. It’s just that where being sad used to make me feel emotionally charged and motivated to act some way - now it just makes me feel sick / mentally nauseated. Also like where things used to make me happy now they just make me feel content. I really don’t mind the fact that I don’t act out in regretful ways anymore - but I just really want to be able to use / feel emotions in meaningful ways. It’s just a very strange, queezy, and oddly peaceful life."
schizoaffective,exagcuc,t1_exa9kqj,1566107104.0,"I’ve definitely dissociated for meditation purposes, but when it comes in attack form it’s not soothing at all. I’m not sure if it is technically schizoaffective related (although they definitely intertwine for me). I had a really bad concussion as a child, and I’ve seen a study that shows a significant link between childhood concussions and psychosis onset around 12 years afterwards, which definitely fits the bill for my experience. I don’t know if that counts as trauma in the psychological sense, but it would make sense to me considering psychosis, brain damage and trauma seem to be heavily linked factors psychologically. It very well could be that my dissociation and disorganization are two completely separate symptoms that are somehow interacting to create an all around very strange experience, but I also am not a professional. It seems like every psych doctor I see wants to group all my symptoms together into one problem, but it could simply be that I have a strange cocktail of smaller problems that are combining to make one large and difficult to identify problem. Anyways, thanks for sharing! I think I’ll start recording my symptoms in a journal and present them to a couple different doctors. Maybe a therapist would have better insight. It’s a strange process for sure. sorry for my rambling haha"

However, it’s important to remember that psychotic disorders aren’t a death sentence, and that they can absolutely be stabilized and adapted to even if they cannot be removed. It takes an incredible amount of effort, and just the right partner, but I believe maintaining a relationship while suffering is absolutely possible, and a huge achievement at that. Great relationships aren’t built on what’s offered by each individual, but what is overcome together. That being said, it is never your partners responsibility to provide you with mental stability, you have to work your ass off to earn your place in the relationship! Beautiful things don’t fall in place without time and effort. A relationship isn’t like a tree, you don’t plant a seed and watch it grow. It’s like a collaboration, the more you work together and offer each other, the greater of a relationship you can build!"

It can feel extremely chaotic and anxiety inducing when things fall apart due to mental health decline, but it can absolutely work out for your own good!

I’m not a professional, but I think there are some cross over symptoms at play between schizoaffective and OCD, where there are a lot of intrusive thoughts. Typically after a period of obsessing with anything I feel is “dark” or “deprecating”, I make a point to have a serious talk with myself afterwards. I do a lot of journaling too, both during and after episodes. It really helps keep my thoughts straight in the moment, and it’s really helpful to look back at what I wrote so I can more easily understand what was going through my head. Sometimes I can nail down some consistencies between them and identify things that need to be worked on that might not have necessarily been apparent during the episodes.

Being mindful of what you’re doing with the time you have in certain mental states really helps me out, because back then I was completely unaware of the fact that I did in fact have different mental states. Generally things don’t get easier because we are aware of them, but being away and doing some self-empathetic planning go a long ways for making sure things get done! Major props to you for staying on the hard road, I promise it’ll pay off, not only from having a degree but also from the insane amount of discipline you’ll have accumulated afterwards.

I’m not gonna completely disregard his advice, but I’ll definitely talk to my psychiatrist more before doing anything that’ll leave me completely broke. It sure doesn’t help that I decided to do a manic induced remodel of my room and painted the walls a while back, because now there’s paint spots everywhere that I get entirely convinced are bugs when I see them “crawling” around.

schizoaffective,eus678d,t1_eus3m0z,1564003785.0,"The unfortunate reality is that there is no formula to schizophrenia. You won’t be able to find a beginners guide to “dealing” with people suffering from schizoaffective disorder, or any disorder for that matter. I understand you’re frustrated, but there is no easy answer. The nature of mental illness is some level of incompatibility of understanding, what you may see as frustratingly irrational, your brother likely sees as a source of anxiety. Mental illness is difficult for both those suffering and those who support them. The best way to begin to make peace with your brother is to understand that there will be misunderstanding. As for his particular symptoms, they vary from sufferer to sufferer as do their treatments. If you want to help your brother, it has to be coming from love and compassion, not frustration."

schizoaffective,eurr742,t3_chcwny,1563997851.0,"Bipolar Disorder and Schizoaffective are very common disorders to have in tandom. Unfortunately, difficult behavior much like you described is also very common in all schizo-spectrum disorders. It’s important to understand that as frustrating as it is to live with somebody who behaves like that, it’s all the more frustrating to live in that state. Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are extremely difficult in that those who suffer are aware that there are problems, but finding and acting on solutions is where the disconnect lies. This difficulty is exasperated by mood disorders, and bipolar is a very difficult disorder on its own. Lack of motivation and feelings of betrayal and persecution are very common for those who suffer from both. I’m assuming that it’s not that your brother is making excuses for misbehavior, but rather he is feeling extremely frustrated with his behaviors and lack of ability to function as he would like. The best thing you can do to support your brother is try to be empathetic. That doesn’t mean you need to let him walk all over you, but it’s important that you try to understand his behavior from his point of view the best you can, and I’m sure that will improve you’re relationship.

schizoaffective,eul7k20,t3_cgf4za,1563897944.0,"Definitely consider laying off. It definitely exacerbates psychosis. And doing it before bed is actually horrible for your sleep, not only will it make hallucinations worse but it blocks REM sleep so you’re actually waking up unrested, and missing REM sleep can make schizoaffective really unbearable.

IQ is historically inaccurate, and often used purely for classification within a specific context (i.e., the military). I believe the formula is an evaluated “mental age”, divided by a physical age multiplied by 100. I don’t believe there is truly an international standard test, and many tests are written entirely subjectively either for marketing purposes, data mining, or institutional use. I would reccomend you stick with any tests given to you by a psychiatrist, and don’t worry about IQ all that much (It’s a historical load of eugenics BS anyways)"

OCD,eqlm2xb,t3_bytcm4,1560146604.0,"I get this a lot. It sounds kinda silly but when I was little I played with legos all the time and my OCD would manifest in always building things exactly symmetrically, and I had an overwhelming need to be able to touch every part of every LEGO brick to clear it of dust etc and if I couldn’t fit my finger in (which I always tried to do resulting in some pretty messed up finger tips sometimes), I had to blow on it or at least do something. Physical symmetry was always a big thing when I was little and I always had to even out sensations (i.e. if I touched something wet with one hand I’d do it with the other or if I fidgeted in a certain way with my fingers on one hand I’d keep going back and forth making sure I fidgeted the same amount with each hand). I don’t have those impulses nearly as bad if not almost at all. What I got instead is the intrusive thoughts. Now it’s like a constant noise I can’t shut off and completely inappropriate emotional responses to things. I’m currently dealing with all of my emotions manifesting themselves as made up scenarios involving people I know. It’s a way of compartmentalizing I guess but a lot of my thoughts take place in made up conversations and arguments between these mental puppets and it’s like I can never get them to shut up. I swear social media is like meth for people who struggle with checking because I’ll refresh my feed like 10 times to see who’s online. And that sounds weird and I agree because it makes me very uncomfortable to think in these ways and act like I do. Right now I’m really at a point where I think I need to get on meds because thinking is hell. I really appreciate that somebody else can articulate that these behaviors evolve, and I think realizing that is a big step for me to start getting serious about treatment. It’s almost like I never thought treatment was necessary because I never acknowledged the fact that I’m mentally unwell because it wasn’t always a consistent problem.

I am not a psychology professional but I have know quite a few people who have suffered sexual abuse much like you described and I myself am OCD. It sound to me like what you may be suffering from is closer to PTSD, and it also sounds like you may be getting gaslit by some of your potential abusers. This is not to say that you aren’t however also suffering from OCD. I can only recommend that you see a psychologist as far as potential diagnosis goes, but I can highly relate to feeling insane. The worst thing I ever did was create a habit of locking myself in my room all day. Socializing and enjoying the company of others can be extremely exhausting for people suffering from these kinds of disorders, and I know it can feel like you don’t have the energy or strength to start socializing. For the longest time I felt that I simply didn’t have a way to socialize. And it may also feel like others view social fatigue as a weakness, but they don’t understand how challenging it can be. I really hope that you’re able to find some peace of mind OP, and please keep fighting. We’re all here for you are you’re loved here :)
Edit: the reason I’m pushing socializing is because at least for me and some others I know that’s the best practical exercise to stay on top of intrusive thoughts. Nobody fights well alone, but with others we can overcome a lot!"
