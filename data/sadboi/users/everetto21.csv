JARMEDIA,ff73lqs,t3_er9r9p,1579640442.0,"Hi JAR!
So lately I’ve been really stressed out since I just experienced prom and it was the worst thing I’ve ever had to partake in. 
I’m not good with crowds of people, eye bleeding neon lights or terribly loud music so I basically had a huge meltdown, you know ugly crying and all that. At that point I didn’t even care about the vapid prom queen pageant or whatever the fuck. 

It was the absolute worst since when I go to parties I usually have at least one quiet place to retreat to but the bathroom walls were literally vibrating because the music was so loud!

It took me a full hour and a half of watching funny JAR moments and David Bowie interviews to fully calm down so I could leave the bathroom stall I was in and actually go home.

So basically I’d like to know if you have any tips for calming down in stressful situations and anger management or if you have any interesting prom stories.

Thanks guys"

the same goes for the sex jokes and other mindnumbingly awful types of 'humor' , like the godawful reference humor.
that's not to say that sex jokes can't be funny, but there's a time and place. 
an example of how not to do sex jokes is from the movie 'a haunted house 2', quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, where there's this scene that just NEVER FUCKING ENDS where the protagonist has intercourse with a creepy looking doll, similar to the one in another shitshow, 'Annabelle' (for some context I was forced to see it at a birthday party)"
