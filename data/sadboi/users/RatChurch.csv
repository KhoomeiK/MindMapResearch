My S.O. and I were in a long distance relationship when I had the worst psychosis of my life. He was gentle and understanding but also tough enough to request I get help when I needed it.
I knew he loved me- he was the one person I trusted so when he asked me to get help- I took that seriously. 
We’ve been together 10 years and married 3.5. 
He has always been the one to gently, compassionately and understandingly request I seek professional help when I need it.
I do know well that that’s not always the appropriate thing to do in a relationship with someone with mental health issues but it’s saved me.
When I talk- he listens and tries his best to understand.
I commend you for asking the hard questions in order to help your S.O.
It won’t always be easy."
schizoaffective,fpu42zg,t3_gfgs5r,1588904227.0,"Absolutely. I also get really intrusive thoughts of things I would never ever do in the real world. They tend to cycle and cycle until a new one comes along.
I agree with the above poster that this is a major symptom of OCD which is one of my comorbid conditions. Have you talked with a therapist about this?"

schizoaffective,fp36qpk,t3_gay2rf,1588274057.0,"Honestly, seroquel has been an absolute life saver. It’s oddly the only antipsychotic I’ve tried that doesn’t have really weird side effects for me besides weight gain and uncontrollable hunger at night. 
It’s totally given me my life back. The weight gain sucks and it’s given me some body dysmorphia but that’s better than being psychotic imo."

Others were people saying my name. I didn’t understand it was part of my illness until many years later."
