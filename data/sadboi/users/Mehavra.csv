westworld,fr3mutz,t3_ge9zv7,1589860957.0,"I mean, I understand that it’s not like season 1 or 2, but, the show isn’t the same anymore. In the beginning, we were in Westworld now we are in a completely different word and thus, I believe that this season should be approached through a new lens. Making a tv show or movie have a complete 180 isn’t even unheard of. In parasite, the movie is much more light and witty until BAM the movie completely changes its atmosphere into a thriller near the middle of the movie. However, I do believe that the flow and transition from season 1&2 to 3 was rough and quick. I also thought the characters also took a 180 which was... weird. I don’t know how to feel about it honestly. Im trying to have a positive approach to this season but I really just feel nothing about it. No good no bad."

It didn’t help a lot but I did make me relax a bit. Going on walks and doing homework when I felt a bit better helped. But the main thing that fixed my problems was when school finished.
