de,flrv9uw,t1_flp64dy,1585428596.0,"ich werde nächste Woche in meinem alten Beruf als Krankenpflegerin auf einer IMC Station anfangen zu arbeiten, solange ich in Kurzarbeit bin. Zum einen, weil ich nicht 2 Monate rumsitzen möchte, sondern etwas tun möchte und zum andern, weil ich nicht mit ansehen kann, wie meine Kollegen vor die Hunde gehen. Ich teile die gleiche Angst mit dir und bereite mich jetzt schon darauf vor die Kontakte wirklich nur auf das aller aller Mindeste zu reduzieren. Es gibt genau eine Person die ich sehe, und das ist mein Kumpel, der meinen Hund währed meiner Schichten betreut. Aber auch er weiß, dass er seine Kontakte genauso begrenzen muss, damit er mich nicht ansteckt und ich den Virus auf die Station bringe. Andersrum natürlich genauso. Ich hoffe wirklich in der Klinik gibt es genügend Schutzmaterialien und Duschen :/

EDIT: an ein Wiedersehen mit meiner Familie und Freunden in der Heimat ist erstmal nicht zu denken. Meine sehr demente Oma ist im Pflegeheim ohne Besucher empfangen zu können und mein Gefühl ist, dass es sie den Sommer nicht überstehen wird."

Ich war 2 Tage lang beschäftigt jemanden von der Corona-Hotline und 116117 zu sprechen. Meine Hausärztin meinte ich müsse den Test selbst zahlen. Letzten Endes habe ich davon abgesehen in eine der 6 Kliniken (Berlin) zu fahren, dort 4 Std mit kranken Menschen zu warten um mir dann doch noch Covid-19 oder zusätzlich einen anderen Virus & Co einzufangen.
Ich bin in Isolation seit Mittwoch, fahre aber einmal täglich raus um meinen Hund auszulasten und gehe wirklich nur raus wenn es nötig ist.
Freunde fragen regelmäßig ob ich etwas brauche.
Solange die Symptome mild sind ist es total egal genau zu wissen welcher Virus dich krank gemacht hat.
Interessant wäre es nur für die Statistik."
depression,fkgya1q,t3_exo6f1,1584180295.0,"through the crisis I had just no time to think about my depression and feelings so much. Even though I started talking about my bio in therapy a couple of days ago it didn't hit me as hard because I am so occupied with reading about the virus.
Then Igot sick, not bad but I showed all the symptoms of Covid-19 EXCEPT of fever.
So, no one takes me seriously, I cannot get tested and so on.
I decided to extra catious and treat it like a infection with mild symptoms and self-isolate.
No problem for me I do 't like to go out and socialize anyways so much.

Now my mum asks me how I feel today and I say better, just a bit of sore muscles.
Her reply is just, oh well, good for you. Then it is probably just  cold.

He response in not taking me seriously and making things so small is really frustrating and makes me angry and makes me write the first post in days in here.

This is also how she treats other problems I have.

- everyone had hard times, you need to dealwith it yourself.. (thanks mum!, it was you who hit me as a child)
-just open those letters! it is not that hard (it is when you have a condition!)
- i think you must have mixed it up. that never happened (it fucking did!)

sometimes i judt think she is so dumb. and i feel bad thinking of her like this

i m glad i live far away from them"

I could go to one of the 6 testing centers, wait in a packed waiting room for hours with so many ill people, get other infections or covid-19 if i am negative and so on.
They wouldn't tell me anything other than ""stay at home"", my symptoms are mild, and I am at no risk.
Besides that, what s more import than finding out which virus made you sick?
Is to NOT become a spreader.

mentalhealth,fjxivif,t3_ffce54,1583674762.0,"I really feel what you re writing, but don't know if I have any advice for you. I have the same diagnosis and my life falls more and more apart. Dealing with depression is already something, if PTSD hits in from nowhere I completely fall apart. Last time took me 4 days to kinda feel myself again. 
I was thinking for years, that I shouldn t date or try a relationship until I m ""fixed"". Even my sister told me that. But it hurt even more! Missing out on that, these nice feelings when you re flirting or the good times together, physical intimacy, or just a fucking kiss!!! 
In my good times I start to open up for that, go out, sometimes check dating apps. 
Last time I met someone who I think is very nice and understanding. It is not close at all, which also gives me the feeling I can cancel a date when I m feeling in a very dark place but still gives me the feeling I m ""in the game""
And honestly, just about to turn 30, I don't want to wait until I m fixed and healed to start seei g someone.
So, as soon as I got a little bit of trust, I m kinda upfront what s going on with me and that gives the other person the chance deciding if they want to deal with the whole package or not. 
For me it s really important to always be aware that I don t project my stuff on the other person too much.
That s not easy as I have bonding issues with men. (1 asshole stepfather + 1 looser dad)
But also do I think that I need to keep on trying to heal my trauma.
I need to find that one who shows me the opposite of what I experienced in my childhood and youth.

Check in with yourself and see if your relationship helps and holds you and be honest to him!"

i ll think about it again.
