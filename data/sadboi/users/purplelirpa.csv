It can help to talk to someone you trust about a traumatic event, but also reading resources for how to cope in the months following trauma, how to know if you need to see a professional (sometimes it's PTSD and requires more attention by someone trained specifically in domestic violence or sexual violence. I hope that you find supportive people, especially people who validate that it wasn't your fault and that you arent broken. 

You will have good experiences that will make you forget all about this. I promise. When you start things with a new partner, ask them ahead of time if they are okay with comforting you if you start thinking about the past trauma. Sometimes building that trust by stopping what you're trying to do sexually with the person and them comforting you can strengthen your trust and ability to be sexual with them. Asking ahead of time keeps you from being stuck crying or scared and needing emotional support that they aren't prepared to give or able to give. This helps prevent you being retraumatized. Good people will be willing to listen to your needs. You deserve that."

sociopath,f875lu2,t1_f873vbg,1574316916.0,"There's a thing that happens to people with BPD where they have a push-pull dynamic. They feel needy, but they are uncomfortable around someone who needs something from them. Schizoid pd also has trouble with that, it's an engulfment avoidance, wanting to avoid having someone else's needs/emotions burdening them. Usually, it's the result of having an emotionally invasive or emotionally incestuous parent. They defend against having someone ""take"" their...energy? Not sure how to describe the defense mechanism.
Whatever is the cause of it, you guys should bring this stuff up with a therapist if possible. That's my best advice. They're trained in coaching couples on how to communicate their needs effectively so that both people get what they need and feel heard.
I get a vibe that he had an overbearing parent who didn't allow him to express his true feelings about things, and so he just withdraws whenever he is upset and has relied on you to read the signs about what he's not saying. 
If nothing else, look up schema modes and see if he identifies with any. It helps me a lot to do exercises about which mode is activated and what the core belief that got triggered is.

As someone with an abundance of emotional empathy, I can say that I have to work very hard to manage it, because it does lead to cognitive distortions. If someone I care about is hurting, I have to actively work to not feel that pain. If I get swept up in it, I might hate someone that has harmed them, or I might be tempted to see them as a victim and enable behavior that is actually keeping them from growing because I want to keep them from hurting. If they get pulled into a cult, I could get swept up in feeling that shared insanity if I don't work hard to stay with my own emotions. Extreme pain or happiness are equally alarming.

At times, I can get really mad at someone for dumping their pain on me, like I feel like someone is making me wade through their shit with them when they really just want someone to listen. But I'm so sensitive to it, I overreact by avoiding everyone for days after an encounter with someone who drained me. I might lash out at everyone who even starts to try to talk about emotions (like I can't feel every damn emotion without them having to voice it).

When I'm tending my social interactions better (weeding out people that drain me), I tend to be able to let my guard down and feel things with people, and that can feel very nice. If the people around me are measured (ironically, I'm drawn to the calmness of people with ASPD for this very reason), I don't have so much draining my emotions. But it can sometimes feel lonely or hollow, like I'm passing a ball that isn't being passed back. I can feel when something is off in interactions, and I usually want people to act how they feel rather than pretend to be feeling something they aren't to please me. So, there's upsides and downsides to both.

But, the question becomes, is it better to have emotionally fulfilling interactions or is it better to have cognitively fulfilling interactions? With the majority of people, I don't want to feel what they feel and I'd rather keep it to just being able to understand where they're coming from and have them extend the same to me. But I have to be able to have some people that I can mutually share emotions with. I think that there are people with ASPD who also have this selective ability, like maybe just with their kids or spouse. For me, when there's too many shitty people in my life, I fall back on my animals as being my emotional fulfillment. Rats are incredibly emotionally empathetic, and I have valued two rats' (my heart rats) lives over most humans'.

I think that's what it is--I see the whole thing as incredibly selfish and that  no one is actually wanting to share something meaningful with me and just want to use me.

AlAnon,f4z61se,t3_dmat6x,1571896299.0,"I agree with what others here have said about waiting to make the decision. But definitely validate your own emotions and the feeling that this was a deal breaker for you. You aren't the bad guy for having boundaries that are being grossly (harhar) overstepped. You don't have to act on this feeling right away, not unless you want to. 

For me, the boundaries have been different depending on who the person was. I also tried very hard to stick to what my needs were in order to not put the focus on the alcoholic.

For you, you need to be able to reliably sleep in a bed that isn't full of piss. This is a very basic need and anyone would agree with you that this is a basic need, barring the person having like some physical problem causing them to not be able to hold it, in which case, there's incontinence products designed to take care of that. I guess that could be a solution--tell him he has to wear adult diapers to bed from here on out. 

For me, the dealbreaker was my mom punching my exbf for absolutely no reason. She was spitting mad and there was no soul behind her eyes and she hit me a few times in the scuffle because I put myself in between them. She's usually a loving person, but she does not respect my boundaries and doesn't like being held accountable. She buys alcohol instead of toilet paper. I had to start hiding my toilet paper because I got sick of her using it up and not replacing it. She's still living with me, I've all but told her to get out. I basically said, ""I'm not going to kick you out with nowhere to go but you need to find somewhere to go ASAP."" And that took me almost a year to work up to.

With my exbf, the dealbreaker was him going on a week-long bender and not noticing that his pet rats (the babies that I just helped be born, and the other two he had prior to going inpatient) were out of water, killing all but one of them. THEN he wanted me to console HIM. I was so angry. I'm still so angry. 

I think my part in this, to getting healthy is dealing with the anger I have about having to heal from shit that I feel like is someone else's problem. Like, people in my life are alcoholics and now I have to go fix myself because they fucked up. And I know I shouldn't feel that way, but I'm already in therapy for other issues and it's just one more thing to add to the stack of shit I have to take care of that other people coast on through life blissfully ignorant and unaware of. And I guess this is where bitter codependency sets in. 

It's really hard for me to not resent people I love for being this way. I hate that me being nice and not wanting to throw someone out of my house leads to shit like them stealing from me or attacking someone I care about. But I love them. But I don't want to be the bad guy. I couldn't stomach the guilt I would feel if something bad happened to them. And that's my problem. I have to find a way to let people suffer the consequences of their actions, even when it makes me look like the bad guy. Even when holding someone accountable means hiding toilet paper and locking up my meds, and turning my back on someone who needs a shoulder to cry on. 

You are completely within your rights to feel the way you do and have the boundary you have. Your needs are important. That doesn't make you the bad person, no matter how someone tries to spin it. There are consequences for bad behavior. Acknowledging that this is true doesn't make you a bad person."
sociopath,f4z2w9d,t1_f4ymz46,1571892779.0,"Good description. Reminded me of [this](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/05/depression-part-two.html).

I'm not a sociopath, but I swear I'm beginning to think that SSRI's and mood stabilizers have fucked up my emotional empathy. Because I have BPD, and I know I dissociate, and that some of the times that I'm not experiencing an emotion with someone it's because I'm dissociated. But other times, I just really would prefer to not even go there when I see someone in pain. I just want to fix their problem or do something to make them go away quickly so I can get back to whatever I was wasting time doing. I see people that can't shut it off and I feel really bad that they're stuck feeling all of these awful things. But then I wonder when the last time was that I felt truly wonderful for someone else's good feeling.

I think a lot of the time I just resent people who are doing well, because I got a shit hand in life. And I hate that I feel that way because it's weak. And I hate that I ended up with the challenges that I did. And then, I've got these dumb morals that I can't break because I don't know why, I'd be overwhelmingly disgusted with myself, and I can't do anything underhanded to get to a better place because then I'd resent myself even more.

And is this my depression? My BPD? Have my meds lobotomized my ability to feel someone else's feelings? Is my body just protecting itself?

Maybe it's because I was an only child and only grandchild for so many years. I wasn't raised around other kids. I didn't understand or relate to other kids. I thought most of them were stupid. Most of my friends as a kid were the neighborhood dogs who I would sneak into back yards of people I didn't know in order to visit. I moved a lot. I got used to things being painfully ripped away in a matter of weeks, and so each new place, the excitement turned more bittersweet. But these strong feelings, none of that shit is feeling what another person is feeling. They're all just my own super strong intense feelings that slowly got cauterized until now I'm left a resentful pile of ash being all dramatic and shit cause haha Cluster B's gotta be stuck being fucking dramatic."

It's weird. As someone with BPD, I wasn't aware of my emotions for a long time. They were so overwhelming, it maxed out my emotional awareness? I guess?

But when I started doing art therapy and drawing pictures while I was talking about things that happened to me, I started noticing my emotions had colors and shapes, themes, to them.

Then, I started seeing other peoples' emotions in the same way. That helped me to ""pan out"" wide enough to see others' emotional states.

It sounds like with ASPD, the issue is with the amount of time that an emotion stays around in memory. Like it gets cleared super fast, so that it makes it hard to relate an emotional experience with someone else.

I would think that the times that you do identify someone who is feeling something similar to what you've felt recently, that you can empathize. It just doesn't stick around for long, has no lasting impact on your behavior towards that person. That's just my two cents, though.

My BPD empathy switch has definitely kept other peoples' emotions from ever reaching my awareness, sometimes until decades later (one of the downsides of BPD, which is that we tend to replay things over and over in our head for decades after, rehashing the same fights and feelings)."
BPD,f490h0b,t3_djsp5c,1571453958.0,"I used to have this more frequently, but I've stopped listening to peoples' tones as much as the content of what they're saying. Certain tones of voice do make me dissociate, though. Like, I could be in a really vulnerable place with someone emotionally, and if they start having an angry-sounding tone, I will close up and lock down everything and prepare for the worst. It's like my body automatically shuts me down so I don't have to feel any pain.

But when the person isn't actually angry, this means that suddenly \*I\* am the one with the weird, unemotional tone change. And they have to puzzle over why I'm talking and acting strangely and then we get in this feedback loop.

One solution I've found for it is if I notice myself feeling that way, if I trust the person, I just say, ""I'm scared."" And I either go be by myself and play a game on my phone until I feel better, or if they want to comfort me in some way, I do that."
raisedbynarcissists,f48zxgo,t3_djseqz,1571453545.0,"There's kind of this amnesia I get where I forget how bad things were with past abusers. Which really fucking sucks because I really need access to those memories in order to make good decisions about who to have in my life, what kinds of boundaries I need.

I'm sorry that they broke your trust. It's insane the way that that cognitive dissonance cracks, it's like you aren't even dealing with the same person because they keep switching back and forth between someone who loves you and would never hurt you and only wants the best for you, and someone who doesn't care about your feelings at all and only wants to control you in order to control how other people see them."

I will say that a lot of my pain has gotten better since going on plaquenil and the med for my raynaud's, nifedipine. I had the earliest onset in my family (at 11) and got meds started in high school due to liver involvement. My autoimmune hepatitis has been in remission for over 10 years and I was able to stop prednisone and azathioprine in my early 20's. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that you aren't necessarily just going to get worse and worse. Medicine has come a long way even in the last decade and there are a lot better meds for treating and managing autoimmune disorders than there were when your mom was your age."

raisedbynarcissists,f3zly66,t3_diuqyc,1571272058.0,"No 17-year-old should be made to feel guilty about not being able to pay bills. Healthy parents give kids that age an allowance in exchange for house chores and stuff, but her bills are definitely her responsibility.

I left home at 16 and lived with friends. I don't regret leaving early. I got my GED at 17. Started college that year at a community college. The thing that really messed with me was that I couldn't get student loans without my parent's taxes, even after I left. My mom's ex-husband definitely didn't give a shit about that and so I ended up owing the college for a semester (that I had to drop after the refund date) I didn't complete. So if there's a way you could report the abuse to a counselor or if you go to church, a church member, then you can get it documented so you can be considered an independent student where they don't take your parent's taxes into account.

If you have friends you can ask to stay with, I'd start asking around. There's options out there."
Empaths,f3zlfdk,t1_f3tnwyr,1571271727.0,"I try to ground myself in something that is more ""me"" after a movie like that. Usually, that means playing with my rats or looking at cute things online.

BPD,f3x610l,t3_diek67,1571232666.0,"Congrats on starting PhD! Yeah I definitely have certain shows and actors that I rewatch. On the flipside, it's incredibly hard on me when they cancel a show that I love, like the OA, I think it triggers my abandonment. I have been so mad at Netflix since they canceled and wouldn't release rights of the show to the writers to continue it on another platform. It's like someone is holding my friends hostage! So I'll just rewatch the same seasons over again."
Empaths,f3t7grv,t3_dhxgch,1571121304.0,"Definitely. I was really sensitive during this movie because I tend to really experience an inner sort of disorientation when someone is displaying an emotion that they aren't feeling. Having to experience the pain he was conveying while laughing against his will was almost unbearable. I think Joaquin did a great job, based on a lot of reading about trauma and personality disorders. 

As far as other movies, I find it really hard not to relate to characters in movies in shows and feel what they're feeling. It can get overwhelming sometimes, especially if it's the bad guy and I don't want to feel bad for them. Some people get weirded out if I can imagine being the bad character, like that means I relate in some way. What I think it is for me is that I can get into someone's perspective, by dialing in to where they're at. But 90% of the time, I'm really checked out of reality because that gets overwhelming irl. At least in movies, I can press the pause button or walk out of the theater."
BPD,f3t74xo,t3_dhsa0m,1571120941.0,"Oh, definitely. For three reasons:

1. I can't bear the thought of subjecting them to the inevitable pain that I will inflict on them (usually not meaning to);
2. I don't have to worry about being abandoned if I'm the one doing the abandoning;
3. I feel smothered by true, human connection and vulnerability and like their needs will engulf me and destroy me completely."
