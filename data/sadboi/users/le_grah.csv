I turned 25 last September and I gotta say... it’s been a weird 6 months. Between growing out of your early 20s, the dawn of a new decade, and more personally starting a new Masters program, and tumultuous times with my partner.... I’ve got plans to realign my life with the things I want from it! And that’s the biggest lesson I’ve learned so far- go after what you want and carpe diem! (Which, for me, turns out that I want to take more time to be by myself at home, read all day, and hang out more with dogs 😊)

What about you?! What do you plan to do at 25? Or rather, what is t that you want this year?"
BPD,fasvp9r,t1_faqfo20,1576331976.0,Wow yeah that’s exactly it! Hearing someone else say this is kind of a relief. Thanks for sharing 💕

I was pretty adamant on finding my own team, so I had narrowed t down to the Borussias and Koln.... but when one day I saw a sale on bvb jerseys and didn’t even hesitate to buy one with Piszczek on it, I had my answer! Nothing beats the heart and soul this team has ❤️"
