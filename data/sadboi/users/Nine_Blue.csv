AskReddit,fowd7fx,t3_fuxyqd,1588117513.0,"I didn't even remember this until someone mentioned this tag and shared a story similar to mine, then I remembered, ""oh my god, I have two stories."" 

The first one was when I was coming back from a dentist appointment when I was probably in early middle school. I was in the passenger seat of my mom's car while she drove, and we were passing by a building that I can remember vaguely looked like a church (white and pointed roofs). There was a person sprawled out on the ground with black-red liquid around him/her and people were standing around the person. It didn't dawn on me what happened until a long while later when I was wondering why my mom yelled at me not to look out the window for a  moment. The person obviously had jumped from the building and committed suicide. I can't remember much detail but I feel like we were so close that I really should. 

Another time was more recently. I was in high school on my way back from somewhere (and I was with my mom in her car again, but this time my sister was in the back seat). There was an accident on the side of the highway that the paramedics and cops literally must've just gotten to because the car is still there and a wreck, and there was a man that had been shot through the front window laying on the ground. The paramedics were literally running over to him when we drove by. He was very likely dead because I remember staring at his back (he was on his stomach) and trying to see if he was breathing and I couldn't see anything. Then, I looked away and calmly told my mother and sister to look away, though my mom saw it immediately and was swearing. 

Both times were eery, both times I almost never think about, like my brain just shut down those memories completely and if I want to think back, I can't put a face to the people."

If I ever hit anybody I‚Äôd automatically expect a swing back and nothing less."
college,fbwx8ht,t3_eevmh3,1577161896.0,"Colleges look at how you improve no joke. 

I failed freshman year of high school and did still shitty the next year but I started working harder my last two years. And though my GPA was still sort of low, they looked at how I improved and I eventually got into a good college for my program and then I transferred to a better university after doing well in college (because it all sort of resets in college)."
AmItheAsshole,fbwwdb9,t3_eerl33,1577161224.0,"YNTA and you‚Äôre not being selfish. I personally don‚Äôt think I could ever have the heart for abortion (and I have nothing against any other women for making this choice at the same time). Take care of yourself and give the baby to the other parents - the parents far away. Call them up when you go into labor and have them come to you as well, it makes it a lot harder for your step sister to just snatch the baby up. Also be sure to inform your nurses and doctors just in case something comes up during delivery and you‚Äôre not able to say where the baby is meant to go."
keto,fbuiyk6,t3_eekdly,1577115199.0,I‚Äôve found from watching my father (who has been on keto for two years now) that he usually only has one cheat day per holiday and he feels gross afterward every time. But he always limits the holiday cheat day to one day and jumps back into it the next day and doesn‚Äôt see much bad side affects. Maybe this could be a plan in the future?
