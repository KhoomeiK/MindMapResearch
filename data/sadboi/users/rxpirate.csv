ShitRedditSays,fr3rnnc,t1_fr3plb2,1589864409.0,"Because nobody knows what the hell it is basically. Feels pretty similar to a couple Vicodin but kinda warmer and lasts longer for me. Kratom batches can vary quite a bit depending on the source company. In some cases (taking a lot) it can give the same tier of pleasure as around 15mg of amphetamine (I’m more familiar with stimulant highs than depressant ones tbh, been doing them way longer). Yeah honestly to me it does feel too good to be true, as kratom definitely feels like a drug, it’s very noticeable.

For kratom there’s a limit on the pleasure it can give you, and after that point will make you extremely tired and nauseous. One of the biggest things about kratom in terms of the drug in general is that it can be a bit hard on the liver, but not really by itself. Like I’ve said I’ve been doing it for quite a long time and have never had any bad liver check up results in that time. However if you take multiple handhold’s worth (an ungodly amount which will make you probably puke) and combine that with like a third of a bottle of liquor or more you’re going to shut your liver down. By itself it’s fine, but don’t combine with it’s other stuff. Honestly don’t be scared I’m mostly overemphasizing it. Media exaggerates this because some people can be extremely dumb. Check twitter replies of government officials wanting to ban it.

It’s definitely gonna be way better for you than actual opiates. Supposedly the indigenous tribes which use it regularly tend to live longer because of it. It’s an antioxidant, lowers blood pressure, and stimulates your immune system so I can kinda see that. My whole family has been sick and I didn’t get what they got while consistently using kratom, and this has happened multiple times (it really does rev up your immune system)."

ShitRedditSays,fr3ohhr,t1_fr3n95f,1589862092.0,"I mean that it will give you a solid high taking a few times a day for 1 to 2 weeks before you need to raise your dose slightly. Now let me be clear,  the high is not even close to the peak high you can get from top tier opiates. But when you have it on no tolerance it’s very noticeable and pleasant and lasts for a few hours. It (mitragynine) binds to opiate receptors, but for not nearly as long as normal opiates.

I have a fairly small dose (few teaspoons a day), but for around 4 months a year ago I was taking a couple tablespoons of the leaf powder. I suddenly ran out and stopped and the physical withdrawal was pretty much cold symptoms for a week and a half. Even though I was taking a lot every day for a fairly decent time the withdrawal was kinda sucky but nothing absolutely horrible. For some people they say it’s horrific, but I’m fairly certain that’s if you haven’t tried many drugs in general and are too easily affected by them.

In all honesty it’s basically like the Diet Coke version of opiates. If you’re sustainably doing opiates you can just ignore me. But if you ever go off the deep end kratom will pretty much prevent withdrawal and help you fairly easily get off them. Also I have a pretty good gig going on with my local smoke shop so I can get like 35 doses for 40 bucks. Normally you’d pay around 30-60 percent more for that. You can easily get it online or at a smoke shop because in most places (in the US at least) it’s a completely unrestricted substance (you need only be 18 essentially)"

This makes them turn to politics to feel like they understand their problems more and gives them a sense of hope by clearly identifying an “enemy” which they have to beat politically out of a sense of moral justice.

Thus, even though these people in that satirical sub are casual republicans or apolitical, they masquerade as the very embodiment of the left wing’s object of hatred: a rent seeking person who values return on their effortless and risky investment and views tenants as merely financial objects. This easily allows them to provoke a reaction in financially unstable strongly-leftist individuals. These individuals seek to validate their plight by pointing out morally corrupt individuals and see that justice is brought to cease their controversial and inflammatory comments. This strong response of justice and anger is regarded as a reaction so delicious to the masqueraders that they take full advantage of written languages’ inherent ambiguity regarding sarcasm. The only solution for these strongly-willed leftists to not play into the hands of reaction-seekers is to change their justice-seeking behavior from one of passion to pure cold critical rationality. Instead of playing into their hands with sarcasm, insults, or evidence to prove them wrong (which tend to not mask “seething” very well), it is better to simply something akin to “what are you even trying to accomplish? This behavior is really strange.”

Well completely ignoring this behavior and trying to accomplish your morally-inspired aims in the real world is probably better, despite how tempting it is to call someone out. That’s the only reaction they want, so that doesn’t lead to ostracizing and less counterproductive discussion but motivates them even more.

TL,DR: don’t acknowledge their behavior in any capacity, even implicating any references. Unless they’re non-anonymous and trying to affect society in real life, don’t discuss their behavior at all.

I’m glad it resonates with you. I find myself often getting caught in pointless thought cycles which don’t really increase overall life satisfaction. For many people holding strong political convictions (really any kind which on some level is tied to different groups and identities of people) is rather counterproductive, wasting time validating yourself by extension of your beliefs being seemingly superior to others. It’s difficult to break because it provides a lot of comforting gratification and requires very little effort to do. In reality such things are very far detached from your everyday life and thus you end up diverting attention away from things which are actually impactful to your life.

Even in the case that those convictions do impact your life (such as having pride in being a member of an ostracized group) the focus is heavily placed on the fact that there is a distinction between groups. Even if it seems positive such as advertising acceptance as a solution to such a conflict, it obscures the fact that such an arbitrary distinction even exists and matters for the individual members when interacting. My theory for this is that people evolved to live in comparatively much smaller groups over hundreds of thousands of years, and in the modern era equate strangers of a different group to “rival tribes”, and hence inherently have an aura of suspicion and aggression on some level. The last ten thousand years of living in groups of thousands to hundreds of thousands is relatively new and the brain hasn’t caught up so to speak for facilitating harmonious relations in enormous pockets of people which up until now were only necessary for small group interaction."

You might say saying all their opinions being irrelevant is generalizing, but it’s true. Caring about politics is entirely pointless and a waste of mental energy, as you can’t affect anything without an immense amount of work dedicated to a very specific social goal. Some people (not all) tend to get fairly worked up in a political discussion and become attached to their specific beliefs because it feels very good to reassure your self by arguing and generalizing other people. In contrast, taking up a meaningful hobby that improves your life on some substantial level takes much more work and broadening what you’re comfortable with.

TigerKing,fpvbj6w,t1_fpsnhe6,1588940852.0,"Meth doesn’t really intoxicate you to the point of less cognitive functioning, in fact theoretically it should boost your memory a lot (depending on if it doesn’t have major impurities that intoxicate you like acetone). Powerful stimulants can make you really confident and be much less affected by feelings of disgust. For that reason one feels totally ok with acting and living like a degen despite being mostly aware of things that would normally bother you.

When you take them for a long time and your body adjusts to functioning with it you tend to be very tired/depressed when they wear off. In either case joe probably doesn’t give a shit. He’s either wired and give no fucks or tired and has no fucks to give. Not literally, he probably fucks a lot."
