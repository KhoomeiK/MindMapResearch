SapphoAndHerFriend,fol6b3e,t1_fol1ej6,1587855730.0,"It's sort of complicated? In the IDW comics, the Transformers from Cybertron are all what we would call AMAB. They're all called he and other masculine things, most of them are shaped like human cis men. Then there's the ones from colonies (Caminus is one, planet of lesbians, it's awesome), and those are all what we would call AFAB. They're all called she and they have boobs and stuff. AFAIK it's never said if they even have genitals so we don't know if there's a difference there. They're treated like separate genders/sexes in canon and by the fanbase.

Arcee is from Cybertron, so she's AMAB. Her arc is kind of shitty in that technically she's forced to transition because an evil scientist wants to make Cybertronians sexually dimorphic, but most people (including nearly all later authors) ignore that and it's not necessarily seen as canon. (The reasons for why no one acknowledges that boil down to the author who did that is a shitbag and we all hate him.) After that, she continues to go by she and keeps her more feminine frame.

Other than that, there are other trans women (Lug and Anode, who are married to each other) who explicitly transitioned of their own free will. There are others who could be argued to be trans (I'm not gonna infodump about that but Strongarm is trans and I will die on that hill).

TL;DR yes they can be trans, yes they sort of  have assigned genders.

Another member, Perceptor, is canonly MLM (he gets a boyfriend in another series he's in). Another member, Strongarm, is only in one panel but she's probably trans too (Cybertronian Transformers are all what we would call AMAB, but she could be from another colony where they're all what we would call AFAB).

A lot of the other members I headcanon as trans or otherwise queer, and they all said trans rights because I'm trans and I said so lol

Basically read Transformers IDW it's gay and trans and they're hot and the Wreckers said trans and gay rights.

SampleSize,fic01wb,t1_fibxqr6,1582334258.0,"I turn 17 next week and I'm too scared to have sex, especially because I'm gay, trans, and disabled so I was never taught anything about having sex as a queer and disabled person. I learned more online and from LGBTQ+ youth centers than I did in school (which was next to nothing, there was absolutely nothing about disabled or trans people and only mentions of gay people, nothing specific about us) but it's still really lacking."
birthcontrol,fi93tsr,t3_f70ji8,1582254910.0,"I got Mirena when I was 12 because I'm trans and intersex, and it went perfectly fine. I had it done under general anesthesia because I was scared so I can't talk about the actual insertion, but after it was fine, a little cramping but like a 5/10 at most. It works like a charm, I haven't had an actual period since I got it and my cramps are so much better."

intersex,fi7d2f5,t1_fi77de4,1582219027.0,"Here's a source: https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28582-scans-prove-theres-no-such-thing-as-a-male-or-female-brain/

Basically if you look at brain scans of self identified men and women, there are differences as averages between them, but if you look at individuals very few people are 100% one way or the other. If you could be neurologically intersex, the majority of the population would be and at least in my opinion it's probably more socialization than hormones or anything, although I'm not a neurologist or anything so I'm just making inferences.

(I probably shouldn't have used the word disproved because I didn't know it was still really debated and I guess I'm amending my statement)"
disability,fi70t7x,t3_f6pm2f,1582211878.0,"When I jump up on a curb with my crutches and have both feet off the ground for a moment, it just feels really cool and I use it to remind myself that I'm still strong (I weigh 200+ pounds, my shoulders are getting huge from muscle).

Finding a bathroom that has the vertical bar by the toilet and actually using it. (Bonus points if it's gender neutral)

Getting good grades in math class (I'm dyscalculiac and ADHD).

Just using crutches in general, it's become so natural to me and it makes me feel good and powerful. I like swinging back and forth on them and doing ""push ups"". I love my crutches so much, I name them and everything lol"
intersex,fi6vz5j,t1_fi6s74o,1582208770.0,"We both have hyperandrogenism, probably NCAH. I think I have mild hypospadias but it doesn't bother me enough to care about it. She has endometriosis too, so she had to get a ton of fertility treatments and surgeries and stuff and had me through IVF. I know that even that's super uncommon for intersex people and a lot of us are completely infertile and/or not able to access treatments like my mom could, but it just bothers me when people say intersex people can't have kids lol"
intersex,fi6rr5x,t1_fi6lj74,1582205686.0,"I mean like I'm with you but my mom is technically intersex (she doesn't ID as such though) and she had me, albeit with a lot of trouble. I agree that being trans doesn't make you intersex, the brain sex thing was disproved, and it makes me SO TIRED as an intersex trans person when people try to say being trans makes you neurologically intersex or whatever."
Blind,fi3scsj,t3_f6arbc,1582126626.0,"I'm right on the line between VI and sighted, so I can mostly see pictures well enough to get by. I have issues with text and complicated pictures so I really like image descriptions. It's sort of like a break for me. I'd really appreciate that kind of sub."
ehlersdanlos,fhr4cjy,t3_f4fvf7,1581817027.0,"People at my old school were convinced I was faking, because they saw me go from very active softball player to hardly able to use crutches in about four years. They had really dumb justification, like I would walk ten feet without my crutches because there wasn't always enough room to use them or at lunch I would just use one because with two its really hard to carry things. I exaggerate my limp a lot now and at my new school things are pretty much fine.

I had a guy (a senior) ask me if I really needed crutches because I picked them both up off the ground for a few seconds. That was the most big brain time thing I've ever encountered and if I weren't so pissed and frustrated I would have laughed my ass off.

I had someone from Twitter say I was faking a lot of things including my EDS because she had it too and we were friends but we had a bad falling out. No one really takes her seriously though which is good.

I've had doctors even tell me I'm faking for drugs or attention or whatever (spoiler alert: I haven't been on pain meds in a year because they won't give me ones that work and the attention I get is getting threatened, kicked, called slurs, and yelled at). My mom actually accused me of faking my disabilities, including being low vision too, when I was younger. I go through the r/illnessfakersgonewild sub all the time because I'm scared people are still saying I'm faking.

I've had a lot of people, including doctors, therapists, and my parents telling me I exaggerate the stuff I have and what's happened to me because of it. I just dropped a lot of doctors because of it which sucks. I'm more worried that I'm exaggerating than that I'm faking, but yeah it's awful. My Beighton score is relatively low (5/9) but I have a lot of dislocations/subluxations, at least once a day and usually more (including my knees, hips, shoulders, and even my sacroiliacs). I use crutches and always wear at least knee braces. People tell me I'm too paranoid or anxious or whatever and I feel like I can't say that my doctors don't take me seriously because then I'm just anxious, because no it's not possible that my doctors with a history of dropping the ball on everything aren't doing enough for me.

(I sorta just word vomited but I needed to so eh)

Edit: yeah somebody crossposted this on r/illnessfakersgonewild and they're lowkey making fun of us so I'm gonna dissociate and might delete this."
