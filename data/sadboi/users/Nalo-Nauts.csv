techsupport,ff9dqux,t1_ff9dlnj,1579710792.0,"Ok, thank you! would you have any idea what these beeps I'm getting while On Windows might be?"
techsupport,ff9dc2r,t3_esdeqv,1579710510.0,"Is it a Bluetooth controller? I had some issues connecting a controller of my own, or is it a wired controller?"
techsupport,ff7k18v,t3_eryi2q,1579651379.0,Tried running the game at the lowest settings and the exact same issue still happens. it runs fine for a bit and then just tanks to like 4fps mid game. I really have no clue what could've caused this.
techsupport,ff6qe3t,t1_ff6ps21,1579632701.0,"Thank you, I shall try that. I thought beep codes only happen when your pc is turning on though, I get beeps well after my pc has turned on and opened steam etc."
techsupport,ff6qa3j,t1_ff6n58i,1579632636.0,Thank you for the help. My game wouldn't even just drop down to 30 fps. it would literally go to like 1-4FPS. would this v sync fix still work??
techsupport,ff6mf21,t3_eryi2q,1579630309.0,My PC has been running the game perfectly fine at max settings for the past few weeks so I really dont know what's wrong

evangelion,eu4ax46,t3_cemhvx,1563447155.0,that's awesome lol!
evangelion,es2uhu2,t1_es1zg77,1561541296.0,"Gendo was annoyed with Rei betraying him, but in the end he still got to meet yui. I'm not entirely sure how that happened though lol. also I thought Yui was in unit 1 at the end and got her wish. To be ever living proof that humanity existed?"
evangelion,es1kw9t,t1_es1ke32,1561499195.0,"yeah, that seems to be the case. we can only theorize it seems. thanks for the replies!"
evangelion,es1jin2,t1_es1ipk0,1561498268.0,I know Seele seem happy with the outcome. but how was instrumentality going to start without rei is my question. Seele didnt know what REI was going to do and while it didn't ruin their plans it didn't seem like a part of it either. I'm wondering how they could have started third impact without rei
evangelion,es1hu78,t1_es1hc0w,1561497151.0,"I have not lol, but that image doesn't really answer my question, thanks though."
evangelion,erzwzob,t1_erz0a59,1561456208.0,"Yeah. that explains my wondering about unit 0 and 2 needing a Cable for power. 

Also why Nervs second branch completely disappeared. I'm not sure about this but I dont remember the S2 drive ever being mentioned in the episode where the second branch dissapears. or perhaps I just missed it. 

Regardless, thanks for the replies and answering my questions!"
evangelion,erywpbh,t1_erxxeee,1561419492.0,"Sorry for yet another question, but I just realised I worded that last question pretty badly. What I meant was.

Unit 1 is a clone of Lilith so should already possess the seed of knowledge, right?

So then Unit 0 and 2, clones of Adam, should already possess the Seed of life, AKA the s2 drive, no? 

Seeing as they had both clones of Lilith and Adam couldnâ€™t they have just had unit 1 eat unit 0 for example to get the s2 drive?"
evangelion,erxy8e5,t1_erxxeee,1561396220.0,"yeah, your right. I completely forgot about that moment lol. my bad"
evangelion,erxev52,t1_erxe40i,1561382804.0,"but wait. since Only unit 1 is a copy of lillith and 0 and 2 are copies of Adam. would they not already possess the s2 drive. seeing as unit 1 already possesses the fruit of knowledge, would 0 and 1 not possess the fruit of life, aka the s2 drive?"
evangelion,erxe40i,t1_erxczfs,1561382182.0,ah yes. I actually completely forgot about the s2 engine lol. As well as REI having part of lillith's soul so lillith lacks one. thanks for the reply! This series is amazing but has so many little details and things to wrap your head around. It's part of why I love it so much!
evangelion,erxabw9,t1_erx9v2a,1561378693.0,yeah I guess so lol. thanks for the reply!
