They also can only work in the middle of the night, for the most part. It's a fun job for people who want to make a little extra money and who have nighttime energy/rogue tendencies 😅 but it's not enough to make a living by any stretch, and certainly not enough to meet their juicers current needs AND extra protective gear. Fortunately the charging is negligible as far as electric costs- they basically use laptop chargers.

I acknowledge this is anecdotal while the websites and experts say otherwise, but I'm pretty sure I've encountered them 2-3 times in the ~20 years I've lived in OR/WA and have seen the nasty results of their bites on at least 2 people I know.

RBNSpouses,fqctddt,t3_ghu8z0,1589268289.0,"1) Encourage her to seek professional therapy with a female therapist she feels safe with (but don't pressure her, just let her know it's a big thing to process and a professional can help)

2) Try not to take things personally, but do stand up for yourself if she starts to display abusive tendencies towards herself, you, or others. 

3) Read some books about complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD). This will help you better understand what may be going in in her mind and what she may be working through to try to be healthy in a relationship. These books can offer a lot more insight to the neurological aspects of PTSD as well as containing case studies and anecdotes.

4) Don't bring it up, let her bring it up. Try to make space for normal, healthy couple stuff as much as possible. Playing video games is a favorite activity for me and partner to soothe our PTSD symptoms and connect with each other.

Having PTSD or other mental illnesses, especially from rape and sexual assault, can leave us feeling very confused about what we are comfortable with and enjoy vs the feeling we get when we make someone else happy (therefore preventing them from hurting us.) Try to make space for her to discover what her boundaries are, what makes her feel safe, and what sort of physical intimacy she is comfortable with - and understand that these things can change moment to moment or day to day.

Good for you for trying to help her heal and have a happy relationship. As a survivor of sexual assault, and partner to someone with PTSD I can't stress enough to remember to take care of yourself first. It's important to have alone time to process and just do stuff for you - because hearing about intense trauma isn't exactly easy. If it becomes too much for you, don't stay because you feel sorry for her or you are worried she will be alone/hurt herself. I'm not saying you should leave her because of this, but just encouraging you to remember to ""secure your own oxygen mask first."" Good luck, and thanks for caring about her heart."
askportland,fqcs5q1,t3_gi0yim,1589267155.0,"Most of the spiders you will come across in your home are harmless- though properly creepy. Jumping spiders (small, fast, ""watching"" you as you move, can jump) and cellar spiders (could easily be mistaken as a daddy long leg, often in bathrooms or cellars/basements) are harmless and curious about people. They will show themselves the most.

Definitely familiarize yourself with the venomous spiders in the PNW, especially the brown recluse, black widow, and hobo spider. Brown recluse bite will necrotize flesh and can be deadly if left untreated. A hobo spider bite is not serious on a healthy adult, but if a baby or pet got bitten they may need medical attention.

She told you she had been sexting in the app all this time? I can't speak for you, but I am poly and I would be hurt if my partner had been engaging in sexual conversations with other people and kept it from me for extended periods of time. Poly relationships usually have clearly defined boundaries and lots of communication about how they feel regarding different potential outcomes. It sounds like your partner ""acting poly this whole time"" is just cheating. 

Good luck with however you choose to proceed. It's not unheard of that open relationships can be born out of infidelity and not wanting to break up. Only you can know what feels right and wrong to you. I would definitely recommend seeking counseling for yourself to help process this no matter what the outcome."
