solaropposites,fqgg62i,t3_ginlhf,1589345429.0,Same. I was a little unsure at first if this would be a rick and morty one trick pony clone but the show really has character. Sometimes the pacing is a little weird (which so is rick and morty after season 2) but solor opposites has its own thing going on. I absolutely love terry and his dynamic with quarvo. I can't wait for a season 2.

I don't care for the guardian set since the KS SG give plenty of guardians and the Pharoah and Pantheon expansions are only like a $5 discount each. Doesn't seem worth it to go all in. I'll get the core and the upgraded god boards but If I decide I want the expansions I'll just pick them up later at a LGS and save the shipping cost.

If I shoot myself, I'll survive but as some cripple forced to stay alive through the care of others. If I hang myself, I'll do it incorrectly and only manage to kill enough braincells to be a vegetable forced alive through machines and medication. If I jump off a building, chances are I'll survive but now as a paraplegic. My biggest fear is failing at my own suicide and making my pathetic existence even more pathetic. That's why I can't kill myself. Because I might fail. And knowing how much of a failure I am, I'll manage to fail killing myself too. That's why you shouldn't."
depression,fpcitoy,t3_gceskp,1588502132.0,That was a big realization for me as well. I'm not good at anything. There's stuff I'm not bad at but there's nothing I'm good at. I'm just mediocre in a lot of stuff.
