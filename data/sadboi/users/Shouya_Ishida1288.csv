YTA for expecting an entire empty room to be dedicated to a place you're barely at anymore.
But you NTA for realizing you're step mother is pushing you away from your father. Mine used to do the same thing. Everytime I came out on my dedicated everyother weekend I rarely spent time with him. And when I did she was always there trying to speed it up. Tho I was at a much younger age around that time my older siblings said they felt the same feeling. 
Talk to you're dad about how you feel about that. But get over the room"
