CPTSD,f8troaq,t3_e1yi66,1574809783.0,"This sounds like demand avoidance. It's usually associated with autism, but rates of cPTSD are through the roof among autistic people so there is a lot of misattributed causality. Luckily, the autism community has some great essays about it online that apply outside that context as well, if you want to clean some insights from that resource."
ptsd,f6pc58k,t3_ds8aof,1573052947.0,"Boy do I know this feeling. Even after I've made huge strides in recovery, I am generally more comfortable putting myself aside (aka, reacting to) for commitments, obligations, other people's wants and needs than I am with exerting my own agency. I habitually overload myself with commitments to perpetuate this coping strategy. It took a lot of practice to even get back to noticing my own wants, needs, preferences. It's really a muscle you have to work on, but there are strategies to help facilitate that process. Hit me up if you want some references."

AskReddit,f25zogy,t3_dbs4pv,1569988297.0,"I'm a cancer researcher and people say all kinds of crazy things about cancer, much of which would be massively irresponsible of me to not correct. I think I do a good job of it. This is how I do it:

- Hear the worldview and life experiences behind the statement, and respect it as a completely valid way to arrive at their current understanding. The world contains more nuance and complexity than a single human being could ever comprehend, and we're all doing our best in trying to make sense of it with these ridiculous brains of ours. Besides, you'll have to use it to frame what you say next in order for them to access the information you're trying to relay.

- Remember what you thought before you learned this thing. Did you just ignore the topic because it was stressful, confusing, unpleasant for any reason? Were you in circumstances where you weren't exposed to another perspective and never thought to fact check the things you absorbing from your environment? 

- With the above in mind, approach the information with an air of curiosity and interest, rather than ""correctness"". Use it as an opportunity to share your excitement about the topic, but be brief! This moment is about them, not you, so share enough to connect but not enough to get sidetracked.

- If you're in a contentious situation, do your best to let go of any hostility. Be kind, ffs."

I'm chiming in to say that I once got a second-degree burn on my pinky finger, right under the nailbed. It got badly infected and there was discussion of a skin graft. But despite the damage, the nail ended up being just fine after the skin healed. In fact, if I didn't remember the horrible consequences of catching 500¬∞F melted cheese with my bare hands, I wouldn't even know anything had happened. It grew really wavy for several months, but it eventually evened back out. I bet you'll have a similar outcome. And DEFINITELY report them to the FDA!"

Add a password manager that generates random gobbledigook strings so you don't have the passwords memorized and you're golden, not to mention your accounts are more secure. That way, I can only use those apps on my phone, and it's way easier to notice myself picking up the phone all the damn time than it is for me to hit control-tab."

SkincareAddiction,eshn101,t1_esga4pt,1561996802.0,"As someone who has lived with depression and PTSD, I want to first give you kudos for taking steps towards healing! 

Your skin and face look fantastic, seriously. I think the confidence you're lacking is due to a habitual lack of self care, by which I mean doing things just to make yourself feel good and pamper yourself in nourishing ways! My skin care routine has been a great avenue for that in my life, but I think that's just as much because it promotes a practice of paying attention to what my body needs and actively taking care of it as much as it is due to using particular products and routines. Sure, drinking more water and using moisturizer will feed your skin, but finding accessible avenues for you to practice self-love will feed your soul. If skincare is that for you, then go to town! Just make sure you're building that same kind of practice in other parts of your life as well. You deserve it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
