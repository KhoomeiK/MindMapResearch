2meirl42meirl4meirl,fr0jpg8,t3_glywxj,1589798085.0,"For context: my boyfriend and I live in an apartment complex with neighbors on every side of us. One night during our first couple months of living here, the cops showed up because we were watching a movie too loud at 8pm on a Monday night which we obviously thought was ridiculous. Fast forward to today, while I was in bed sleeping my boyfriend started to adjust the blankets on top of me before leaving for work at 5am, and I got really freaked out thinking it was someone or something trying to grab me. I immediately started screaming at the top of my lungs and kept screaming for at least 10-20 seconds straight. Once he got me to calm down, we were pretty much expecting the police to show up but as it turns out, nothing. Not that I want the police at my door for no reason but it‚Äôs a little disappointing and telling of how little people around us really care. 

tl;dr - I could be literally murdered in my apartment and no one would bat an eye but I better not think about watching a movie too loud on a Monday night"

BPD,fpcvxv2,t3_gcm1pv,1588514123.0,"I made the scary and sad realization a long time ago that the only person that‚Äôs ever 100% guaranteed to be there for me is myself. Of course I have other people in my life now but I worry that towards the end of my life I will be alone, like my mother is. The best way I‚Äôve found to combat this fear is to work towards becoming the best version of myself so if I do end up alone, I will have my own little sustainable support system within myself. 

Could I be with another person like myself? In the past I‚Äôd say no, but now I‚Äôm leaning more towards I could be very good friends with open dialogue with someone like myself, that could possibly lead to a relationship later on. So in time, yes, I think I could date someone like myself. It‚Äôs a good reminder that even when I don‚Äôt think I am, that by my own standards, I‚Äôm worthy of love - from both myself and from other people. 

Thank you for this post OP, this is a really refreshing and interesting way to think about self love."

BorderlinePDisorder,fp19qf8,t3_ganqhd,1588228532.0,"You are 100% not being dramatic, you were assaulted and you did the right thing. I would strongly suggest cutting this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù out of your life for good as she both put you in that situation to begin with and then gaslighted you, likely just to cover her own ass it seems. Friends do not do that to each other and you deserve better. 

I know what it‚Äôs like to be assaulted and have people that were around completely gaslight me after it happened. It was horrible but they were wrong and they‚Äôre no longer in my life. 

As far as the police report goes, be prepared for people to question you, not believe you, gaslight you, and make you tell your story over and over and over again. I‚Äôm not saying this to be negative, this just sadly is how it is when assault victims go to the police a lot of the time. You‚Äôre very brave for coming forward and you did the right thing. Hang in there, it‚Äôs going to be a long road ahead, but ultimately this experience will strengthen you. What happened to you is not okay and don‚Äôt let anyone, not the police, your ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, your family, anyone in your life tell you you‚Äôre being dramatic."
Hair,fozr09k,t3_gahhag,1588195350.0,"You don‚Äôt get to decide what‚Äôs empowering for women and what isn‚Äôt. Some women decide to buzz their hair because it‚Äôs extremely damaged, other women do it to reclaim their bodies/hair after a breakup or assault. And some just do it because they want to, and that‚Äôs it! Arguably buzzing your hair off as a woman, especially since there are many many people out there who agree with you and aren‚Äôt afraid to express it, is more empowering than having long hair because it defies conventional standards of beauty. This opinion seems unpopular now because it‚Äôs dying out as more women are saying screw it and going for the plunge, realizing that it really is just hair and doesn‚Äôt define their beauty. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with having a preference of long hair on women over short or buzzed hair at all, but to say it isn‚Äôt empowering and telling women not to do it because you personally don‚Äôt like it is kinda wack, and will only make people considering it want to do it more ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

AskReddit,fl0na8q,t3_flgaml,1584711225.0,"I haven‚Äôt lost my job permanently, but I‚Äôm a hairstylist working for a chain and the salon I work for is closed until April 1st, but I have a feeling it‚Äôll be closed even longer. I read an article about how things aren‚Äôt going back to normal anytime soon, social distancing has to be a part of life for a more extended period of time. I can‚Äôt imagine how this will impact the beauty industry as a whole- people need their hair done but there‚Äôs no way I can do someone‚Äôs hair without touching them or being within a dangerous range of them. (unless I wanna put my tools on 5ft poles like some viral videos of stylists I‚Äôve seen, which is not only supposed to be a joke but way harder than it looks) Maybe once we‚Äôre back open, we‚Äôll only have 2 or 3 stylists on at once, spread out between stations, all of which have to wear gloves and masks and deeply sanitize in between each person. Would taking those extra measures be enough to slow the spread while being able to remain in business? Who knows. 
I just feel lucky that I work for a chain and that I‚Äôm not out on my own, at the very least I get pto and I have slightly more job security than other stylists in the industry. However I have a feeling a lot of people are going to start finding other ways to cut their hair, meaning a decline in business and a decline in my tips (which makes up nearly half of my income) since so many people are losing their jobs from this nightmare of a situation. Either way, a lot of people are gonna be suffering with some ugly hair through this whole thing and besides making house calls - which is not only a big no no for my job, but also defeats the purpose of being out of work since it doesn‚Äôt help stop the spread - there isn‚Äôt anything I can do about it. 

tl;dr - hairstylist, didn‚Äôt lose my job but there‚Äôs uncertainty on the horizon for my job and the beauty industry as a whole, same as the rest of the world."
