These are my thoughts exactly. I'm floored to hear that owning multiple properties makes you an asshole. 

I don't think it's immoral to own several properties.

Owning property in a variety of countries is a good investment. I don't see how they're driving up the prices. With the exception of this 5th home; the rest are rented out etc."

If she did nothing and there was a shooting she'd be in boiling hot water. However, since no one was killed or hurt she gets demoted?! WTF is wrong with these schools!?!?

According to her school district she was doomed from the moment she found out about the ""bb gun.""

She also squirrled away a lot of those loans, applied and for several scholarships and got a few. She then graduated (yayyyy go her!) & shortly after graduation she ran her credit straight into the ground.  

If I recall correctly she has close to 1million hidden away mattress hiding style and doesnt give a fuck. Very few people know she has this. 

Oh & she's 35. She expects to be dead in 10 or so years.  Sure, she could live longer. The oldest person who lived with sickle cell was 80 or 90 .... but she doesn't think she'll be that lucky."
movies,fhttp4j,t1_fhtryeb,1581878025.0,"So because she wasn't an alist celebrity her death should not get media attention and people should not care?

I don't care if she had a 2second background cameo...girl was 15. Fucking 15. Her fame is irrelevant. She was a child with a lot of potential that passed away. Too many young people who have potential die. It's a good reminder on how precious life is."

wedding,fhrmqxo,t1_fhrm0gd,1581830816.0,"Yep. I was the EXACT same way. It was the 2nd to last one I tried on. The 1st and last were good contenders but that fourth dress SPOKE to me. 

Especially with the veil we got to go with it. It also just so happened that the 1st and 5th dress were a couple thousand dollars. Meanwhile, the dress I settled on was under a thousand. I was shocked. The veil was more than the dress!

The whole reason I settled on it, was because - and granted I know it's a good sales tactic - but when the stylist said, ""lets try the fourth one on again,"" my face apparently lit up without me noticing. He laughed and pointed out that, ""this is the one, your expression says it all."" & he was right.

I treasure the fact that not only did I go to his funeral- that I had an opportunity to speak at it. 

I honestly would encourage OP to go to the funeral. To Keep his phone on him fully charged and check on it very frequently. If his wife is in labor he can be prepared to go to his wife and drop the funeral. 

At least he would get comfort in knowing he made an effort to be there in his twin sisters memory."
movies,ffz1xae,t1_ffyz6nu,1580361317.0,"I absolutely loved this movie. From the first words spoken I was hooked. I don't normally like movies. I hate theaters too. I go because my fiancé is  a movie buff. I've seen more movies in 2 years than I have my entire life. I have issues with large crowds and how loud the audio is in the theater. 

The rape scene really made me extremely uncomfortable. I did like how nonchalant Rosalind was about it though. She seemed like an extremely dynamic character that was very strong. 

Laura's death and the fast pace of disaster scenes also really made me upset. I almost walked out after that, because I couldn't stomach it. Not because the film was terrible, just I couldn't deal with it very well. 

I ended up being really glad I stayed. The ending was quite satisfying to me. I loved it. I genuinely hope there is a sequel. It'd be nice if Rosalind's character was further developed. 

The writing in general was unique and it fit really well. I also liked how he pitched the movie within the movie. It was kinda meta and just worked well for me.

I haven't stopped thinking about this film since I saw it and would totally see it again. The last time I wanted to see a movie twice in theaters was when I was 8 and Anastasia came out. hahahahahaha."

I understand that people, especially African American men and women face causal racism every day. However, when a minority uses 'the race card' to get their way, it is my belief that they are contributing to the problem. These kinds of people are actively perpetuating the same racism that oppresses them."

Right now I'm back to 1hr lunches, but that's because I have a second freelance writing career and like to get some work done for that on my lunch break for that. I can usually earn $30 on my lunch hour with my writing work when you break it all down.

>I have a rare condition that can cause vomiting

It's a pancreatic condition, bad enough that at one point I was on a feeding tube for 3 or so years without consuming food orally. Funny enough, I haven't had a drink since I was 22 and diagnosed with this mess. I carry a vomit bag because although I am better than I was in 2017 I still vomit roughly 10-15times out of the month. I carry the bag as a precaution because of that.
