VetTech,ffdxs5m,t1_ffdx1n9,1579831577.0,Sorry for the lack of specifics. And yeah it’s totally fine to be hard on me! I understand how serious this occupation is and the last thing I want to do is endanger an animal in any way. It’s just the little things.. paperwork. Rooms. The head tech is just hot and cold and there’s no consistency I feel. I am just feeling defeated and I probably shouldn’t have posted. I just want to do well and this is probably part of the learning curve. I guess I can give an example from today: there was a dog that is very nervous and unsocialized. The tech wanted me to hold for them so that they could give some shots. I told the head tech that I didn’t quite trust the dog and I wanted to know their opinion. They totally blew me off and said the dog was fine so I restrained. The second shot the dog tried to bite and broke from my grasp (large breed) and the tech chewed me out. I said I wasn’t comfortable and hinted at a muzzle...? And I was blown off. Then when it went wrong the tech said they would have someone else hold. I’m sure I failed in some way here but I just feel so confused. I tried to restrain well but I could tell the dog was uneasy. I just need some advice. I’m being really hard on myself and the head tech isn’t really giving me guidance.
