depression,fftfjbb,t1_ffteoxr,1580219086.0,"Ugh, you just spoke to my soul. I'm a huge Plath fan. 

These are fantastic suggestions. I'll try to be more present and enjoy the little things...and yes, I absolutely need to work out. I think the issue is that I go out with friends at night and have class early the next day. Plus I am walking a ton, so I have been counting that as exercise, but I've been wanting to go running. I think it's a mixture of poor planning and fomo, but I think this week I am going to try and go at least once. 

Thanks, friend <3"

OCD,f8463ip,t1_f844qsq,1574232330.0,"I guess it's just hard because a lot of my self destructive tendencies made the relationship very difficult. And he definitely sees it as a me not him thing.

Also, it's hard when so few people understand the disorder. Like I would try to explain my mental state to him and I think it just freaked him out.

Anyway, thanks for your thoughtful and kind words. It helps."

nocontact,f72gg7x,t1_f72fzwi,1573362197.0,"That's true. He actually blocked me a while back and I have been checking through my side account. I know it's bad but he actually blocked me after I accused him of cheating...I guess I am just too preoccupied with the idea that he at least had a wandering eye. He's technically out with his best friend and his best friend's girlfriend. I know he's not out there dating probably, but he did basically choose his best friend over me in the end. He always pulled away from me when he'd spend a lot of time with him. I was never cool enough I guess...which is immature on his part (We're in our late 20s, not 17).  


I know it's not good for me. I think I'm gonna stop. In the meantime, thank you for your kind words."

He's more private than me. Plus he didn't really do me dirty. We both agreed we want to be friends in the future
depression,f5y9qwc,t3_dpl4bu,1572552919.0,"I get that. Read something recently though that said ""when you cringe at past things you've done it's because you've grown"". Helps me a lot with  anxiety. Also, people don't care as much as you think they do. That's both a sad and uplifting fact. Not everyone is analyzing your every move.   


And it's okay to be sad in private. It's quite common.  Just make sure you talk to someone, preferably a professional. Much love <3"

depression,erqpx7t,t3_c3fu7o,1561149181.0,"It's not a little problem to want to like your outsides. Your body is the container of yourself. You can't change it all that much, and even if you do, you still might not like it. I totally understand.

What helped me get over my eating disorder and my body dysmorphia was focusing on things I like about my body or focus on my skills as a person.

You might be amazing at making people laugh or smile-that's sexy. You might have a beautiful twinkle in your eyes, or a cute patch of freckles. Focus on what you have, and what you like, and try to see the good in yourself.

And most importantly, do notttt compare yourself to other people.

I follow Bunny Michael on IG. Highly recommend her.

I know it's hard but please know we are all beautiful in our own way."
