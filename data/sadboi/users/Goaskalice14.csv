Advice,ew9orlj,t1_ew9oetq,1565228695.0,"Maybe he was tipsy too. It’s not like he joined her, but she was nude in the shower with the door open. He took a peek. Yeah, that’s bad, but not egregious. It’s really no big deal. People are silly when they are drunk. No inhibitions. Nothing happened. I’d just move on. If he starts to get creepy, then yeah."

Advice,ew9g21w,t3_cnbg0d,1565224735.0,"I think your overreacting. You got wasted and invited him into the shower. It happens. He just sent you a text. Maybe he is interested in you. Just blow it off and chalk it up to an awkward moment. If anything else further happens, I’d mention something."

relationship_advice,ete6bf4,t1_ete6404,1562724031.0,He blames it on his autism. I call bullshit on that. I think I expect more. It’s probably best if I found someone as interested in a more mutual friendship. I think he also feels sorry for me. I don’t want a pity friendship.
relationship_advice,ete56hw,t1_ete4yzo,1562723196.0,"I don’t think he expects to meet me. I guess I’m asking for too much, but I’m not going to tolerate it anymore. He says he’s sorry, but then does it again, over and over and over. I need to detach."
