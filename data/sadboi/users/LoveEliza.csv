I think he would have a hard time siding with someone threatening to brutally execute her when he has already joined her class. I can see the perspective of him being sworn to be Rhea's knight, but I don't think it is unreasonable for him to side with Byleth.

As for the Blue Lions, many of them have reasons to support Edelgard's cause. Sylvain hates crests, Mercedes' brother is with Edelgard, Ingrid struggles with her obligation to marry for her crest. And have you seen Crimson Flower Dimitri? He is definitely not sane in that route. At the Holy Tomb raid he acts sane in every route, but he is unhinged after Edelgard starts the war regardless of the route.

I think you underestimate how Rhea's transformation would affect people. It would be like if the pope turned into a giant dragon while threatening to slaughter (not even execute, but rip the heart from her chest) your close friend. That is paradigm shifting, imo."

BreadTube,eq1jrdl,t1_eq1ge2c,1559711293.0,"Hey friend, you seem heated, let's calm down a bit, OK?

I fail to see how you can believe a trans woman is a woman and then say they should be treated as men? Especially when the science is just against you in the idea that trans athletes on hormone suppressants have a natural advantage. Can you show me any studies showing otherwise? Because I tend to think that if it is good enough for the IOC it should be good enough elsewhere. 

As for the video you linked, I don't know about the situation, but I'm not inclined to do more research on a video uploaded by ""Adam and Eve, Not Steve"" (lol) about a tweet directed at Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan, who both have unsavory views on the trans community. I don't believe it is in good faith.

Also, are you capable of reading? Because you seem to have quoted the word Puberty Blocker but then ignored the rest of the paragraph? Puberty Blockers are different from HRT in that they are temporary and completely reversible. Their purpose is to let the child get to the age where they can legally consent without choosing one way or the other. They can then either come off puberty blockers and go through puberty as their gender assigned at birth, or come off puberty blockers and begin hormone replacement if they are trans. I don't really think I can explain it more simply than that. Transition is much more difficult once you have developed secondary sex characteristics through puberty, so this just postpones that until the child is old enough to make their decision.

And I don't know how I was policing language lmfao. I said that when combined with the rest of your rant, which came off as rather transphobic, it looked pretty funny and didn't do anything to make you seem more credible. I couldn't possibly care less if some random stranger on the internet uses the word ""retard."" You're right, there are bigger things to deal with. I do apologize though, as I didn't realize it would trigger such an intense response from you!

I am curious in what way you claim to support trans people though? You seem to have restrictive beliefs about hormones, do not believe they should be allowed in sports of their gender, and don't think they should be allowed to use the bathroom of their gender. So I'm really failing to see where you support them?

&#x200B;

But yeah, burn in a ditch please uwu"
BreadTube,eq1fkmr,t1_eq1cyl5,1559708167.0,"Oh wow I was expecting a little nuance from your earlier comments. Instead it’s just transphobic talking points lmao. 

Trans women are not allowed to participate in sports without being on testosterone suppressants at which point they are very similar to cis women. And trans women have been allowed to compete in the Olympics for 15 years without a single one even qualifying, so I find it hard to believe they have some incredible advantage. I certainly wouldn’t call it unforgivable. 

No one is letting children transition either.  Prior to puberty, children questioning their gender can be given Puberty Blockers, which simply delay puberty until the medication is stopped, at which point puberty resumes as normal. This allows children to make decisions once they get a little older without going through puberty first, since transitioning is far more difficult after puberty. 

I’m also not sure what you mean by “finishing the job” since there is no endpoint for transition. Lots of trans men and women transition in lots of equally valid ways. Regardless, I fail to see how the genitalia of individuals in bathroom stalls affects you. Trans people are no more likely to harass or abuse the people in the bathroom either, and that is a crime already, assuming that’s where you are coming from. This argument also tends to ignore trans men, who you seem to expect to use the women’s restroom until they reach a point where you arbitrarily have decided is “finished” even though I know lots of women would be uncomfortable with a bearded man making no effort to present as a woman coming into the bathroom since he has a vagina. 

I hope you can see that if a self-proclaimed leftist like you holds all these beliefs, it may be a good idea for us to support and protect underprivileged classes and groups before, during, and after revolution. Using an ableist term like “retard” to finish off a transphobic rant doesn’t look so hot either."

pokemon,eptz6y5,t1_eptxkoj,1559500578.0,Yeah Ash was the only one that KO'd his Darkrai. And then he sent out Latios
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,eptxn27,t1_eptlc2r,1559499679.0,Can this really be considered a dog whistle? It's more like a fog horn tbh

leagueoflegends,eow88hi,t1_eow4qun,1558906342.0,"No of course you can play immobile ADCs vs Blitz, you're right. It was the first example I thought of and I probably should have thought of a better one. You definitely can play less safe as Ezreal vs Blitz with E up though, since you can buffer it, but it is certainly possible without the cooldown."
leagueoflegends,eovmhb2,t1_eovkgwk,1558897544.0,"Yeah, like say you are bot lane against a Blitzcrank. Every time the jungler blows your Ezreal E, thats 10+ seconds you can't safely walk up to the wave. And its not the kind of thing you can see from just pressing tab or something to see a death or a blown summoner"
MensLib,eovlihv,t1_eove5af,1558897114.0,"I think that in order for that to be a possible solution, both people need to agree that it isn't necessary. If one parent says it is unneeded and the other disagrees, that is essentially the same thing as the first parent putting the responsibility for it onto the second one, right? At least from the second parent's perspective, which leads to the problem the article is discussing."
enoughpetersonspam,eosb5y0,t1_eorwext,1558820452.0,Well yeah but is it called the first amendment in the bill of rights of the US constitution? I didn't think so. Checkmate.
