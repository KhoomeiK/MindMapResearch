depression,fptgi3k,t3_gf6llw,1588890822.0,"Fuck I feel this. My boyfriend broke up with me after slipping into a bad spiral that neither of us totally realised (or I was unwilling to accept) as he didnt see me for ages. Smoking weed all the time, not taking meds etc. Covid has been an absolute shambles, but since this wake up call I just feel the need to be better, be happier and yeah be more worthy. Feel like I've pissed off people from apologising so much but it's hard when you feel your whole world crashing g down around you and no matter what you try and do to fix it you still feel like the same shitty person deep down."
depression,f93ijza,t3_e3frps,1575059940.0,"I'm pretty open about my struggles with anxiety and depression and its affected me for years. I didnt have the best upbringing, my mum struggled with alcohol abuse for years and such bad anxiety that I associate Christmas to fighting which makes me jealous when I see other peoples happy families all close together. My dad got diagnosed with cancer 3 months ago and it fucking kills. But if I can bring just a little bit of happiness to someone, even to just make them smile for a moment then it's worth it. Just because people seem happy - like theyve got it all figured out isnt always the case. I'm happy to admit that I'm finally happy with the person I am, and I'm a positive person. But the shit I've been through and the situation I'm in now doesnt define me or my happiness. 

Just know it gets better, I've been in such dark places becsuse of my past but being happy isnt something to envy, if I can do it, so can you. :)"
AskReddit,f3d42u2,t3_dgi4a2,1570831633.0,"That I shouldn't have to apologise for everything, or justify my whereabouts. Or being made to feel guilt tripped into not seeing friends because ""I wasn't spending enough time with him"". Or for us to never hang out with eachothers friends. Took me to breaking up with him 3.5 years later (at 21) and moving out to realise how controlling and emotionally manipulative he was, and that his behaviour wasn't normal at all. 

Still a lil damaged from it 3 years later, but much happier now."
Anxiety,f1kg7bs,t3_d9mep4,1569535253.0,"This was really useful to read actually, made me realise that I really do need to go back and get more help. Anxiety is at such a constant high and I feel so dissociated and unworthy. I can barely sleep, panic attacks are a regular, and I'm constantly on edge. I've been thinking about therapy again, as I've got so much going on inside my own head that it's making me not want to feel anymore as the constant stream of thoughts is exhausting."
AskReddit,ezzwl4c,t3_d2uw3s,1568293971.0,"Using alcohol as an escape. For a long time people used to just associate me to being a drunken mess as I was always absolutely hammered (18-20). It took a while for me to realise that was using alcohol as an escape, and a lot of the dark thoughts or behaviours I trapped inside came out whilst I was drunk, which often hurt if worried people.

A year and a half alcohol free later, I know my triggers and I know alcohol still takes me into those depressive states. On medication now and I've had counselling but it took me a long time to realise that I was using alcohol as a coping mechanism to deal with my issues rather than accepting them. A lot of people just assumed I just couldnt handle my alcohol and I was a bit of an asshole lol. 

24 now and I'm a lot stronger, happier and aware!"
lonely,ezl3w4r,t3_d15vou,1567971523.0,"It took me such a long time to realise this, and I stopped changing myself around people. I am 100% myself in front of everyone (painfully honest sometimes and a complete idiot), and god it's so freeing being able to accept who I am finally. 

Over time you'll realise that by accepting yourself, and not changing to fit in with people that you might lose some friendships, or just realise that they werent that strong in the first place. It's hard, but I dont regret a thing, and I'll never go back to trying to change to fit in with people. Either take me for all of me, or dont have me at all.

Stay strong, you got this!"
