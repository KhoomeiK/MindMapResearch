Good Job op, definitely might've been a strange from of munchausen by proxy. N's and munchies have similar traits, definitely conviced my Nmom had tendencies of one."

raisedbynarcissists,f6xgz7h,t3_dtagv4,1573249372.0,"Absolutely, especially when I can't remember half of the things I feel like I'm lying or missing memories of my childhood. Nmom would gaslight about the dumbest things like ""no we never took you there you must've been dreaming"" even when I have proof Nmom took me to X place when I was a kid or she would stretch the truth on what really did happen. I also believe it's maybe something in my tone when I tell people some of my interesting stories like ""I've been to Xplace and it's really cool"" or ""I've saw X celebrity here and they greeted me"". Even more casual things about me don't sound real anymore it feels like ""I play Xgame too have you tried this"" or ""yeah my native language is Chinese"" I can see the person face looks like they're doubting me"

raisedbynarcissists,f318lf9,t3_deuglr,1570570085.0,"Exactly it's even worse for me from coming an Asian culture where elders are above everyone and family comes first... It drives me up the wall when they tell me stuff like ""why don't you just talk to her so you both can resolve it together "" I mean sure friend why not I just break nc I've had for the last 6 months unlike the 20k other times, this time must be a charm since every other time I tried to and nothing worked. Maybe now it will work, maybe this time she won't act like a child screaming and crying refusing to listen to my POV. Even worse when they try to compare their normal Asian family to mine saying ""she means well and she loves me to put it all behind learn to move on and forget about the past"" or  I've heard even worse like ""I must learn the hard way without help because others have real problems unlike you being depressed!!!!!"" Please try saying that when the 18 years you've been alive your mom done everything single thing wrong and now you're still fighting legal stuff because she managed to do ssn fraud while leaving you mentally disabled for life!"

90DayFiance,f113bhz,t3_d5czu7,1569120566.0,"OP are you Asian or grew up around any Asian  Dialects? As someone who is Taiwanese and grew up speaking a Chinese dialect from my ama as for me another east Asian language can be easier to pick up, but for a non native speaker or not having any  family member to help learn any Asian languages it can definitely not be easy for them and it can take years for her especially since she wasn't exposed to any of it as a kid. Deavan can slowly learn it but it won't be easy as an adult."
raisedbynarcissists,f10dj7d,t1_f0ympqh,1569110940.0,"I have a similar memory, I was around the same age when Nmom decided it'd be a great idea to throw a young me who couldn't swim in a 6 foot pool where I went to the bottom and started to black out until another Efamily member came to save me. You've would've thought someone should have called 911 or took me to the ER but nope Nmom was ""a hero who saved me"" with no CPR or any medical training before hand until she realized it was actually a messed up scenario where someone would have called her out on it.... Now everytime I brought this story up as a kid until NC she would gaslight me saying ""it was a dream"" or ""the voices in my head told me it"" until I asked my dad about it a bit ago who was actually at work during the incident but Ngrandmother had apparently called him about it."
