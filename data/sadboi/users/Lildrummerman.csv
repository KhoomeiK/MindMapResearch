BPD,fnmhal2,t1_fnm8gmw,1587071412.0,"] Often times criticism feels like an attack on you it's important to understand that you actually *need* criticism to get where you're going. People will always criticize you even if you do your absolute best, double check and proof read three times. This sucks no bones about it.

But think of it this way.

You don't always want to be the way you are in terms of anything right? If you are a student in a few years you want to perhaps have a job or go to college etc. In order for you do to that you *are going to notice things about yourself that you don't really like* and you're going to change that because that's really the only way to progress to the person you wanna be. 

Think of life as a video game. People giving you criticism can be seen as hot tips. Things you may not have noticed but you totally wished you did. And when you notice them you can play your game a little better. And yeah, it's a little embarrassing and confronting when someone criticizes but by simply taking the tip and thinking about it instead of feeling attacked, you can choose whether or not to even apply it. 

When you freak out (which is understandable) you rob yourself of the chance to *invalidate improper criticism*. Sometimes people are wrong and if you always freak out, then you can't really pin point the bad faith criticism from the good.

And cut yourself some slack. Why do you have to do everything so perfect? Of course you're going to make a mistake here and there *why shouldn't you be allowed* to make these mistakes when you're trying your best. 

I hope this was helpful and not too much of a rant, you clearly want to fix this and it's going to take a long time but you can do it."
