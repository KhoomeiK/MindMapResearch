Anxiety,fq97a4g,t3_ghiqy2,1589188148.0,"Literally me. I’m forever wondering whether I said the wrong thing, came across as disinterested, upset someone, wasn’t chatty enough, the lot. Yet to the person you’re talking to it was very likely just a regular conversation and nothing bad was thought. I do this a lot, but I find what helps a little is to think back to all the times that you’ve worrier about this, and then think well how many times has that actually ended up in you offending someone? Chances are not many at all. And so the likelihood is you’ve done nothing to worry about. Sometimes I appreciate that’s hard, but it helps a little sometimes 😊"

The nature of my studies means I’m usually tired anyway, but I’m able to catch up during the week 😊 It can be hard though and it does mean I’m often playing catch-up with sleep so just be careful if you’re considering doing it! Make sure you also get time for yourself it’ll be important if you’re constantly changing sleeping patterns 😊"

Nightshift,fomb0vc,t3_g891r6,1587883750.0,"I’m currently a uni student and have been working 2 night shifts a week for the last 2.5 years. It’s doable, but you have to make sure you figure out a sleeping schedule which works for you on your days on/off and how you’ll adapt between the two. E.g. on a Sunday morning when I finish my last shift, I sleep between 8am and 1pm. Wake up and spend the rest of the day awake until around 10pm and then try and get a relatively normal sleep that night ready for studies the next day! 😊 it’s hard but it can be done"

Anxiety,fnkgnvh,t1_fnjf2dd,1587026339.0,"Thank you so much for your help, I honestly appreciate it more than I can tell you! Before I would try things like deep breathing and meditation, but for some reason I’m finding them really hard to do, especially when I’m feeling so deep in anxiety. I haven’t tried mindfulness, it’s something I really would like to get to grips with, I just haven’t put it into practice yet so maybe that’s something I can try and get to grips with too, just as another coping mechanism. 

I also really like the idea of a mind dump. I think I’m going to try that next time I feel like I’m drowning in thoughts! Thank you again for your help and your hugs, you’ve given me hope! 😊"

They have courses for beginners which talk you through the basics and how to start your journey, and as you progress you can complete the more advanced courses. You can also do unguided meditations on there, so if you find it easier to meditate without the guidance of someone else that’s available too.

LongDistance,fimrdzi,t3_f8on6h,1582543972.0,I find myself doing the same after I leave my boyfriend or he leaves me. I find it helps to focus on things like work or seeing friends. It can also be helpful to start planning the next trip to see each other so you can start looking forward to that too and to remind yourself you will see them again. Maybe youc an schedule a date night together over FaceTime to help break up the distance while you’re still feeling sad about her leaving this visit?

By the sounds of it you’re both very lucky to have each other, you sound so happy together. 5-7 years is a long haul, but you know what, if you can make it through that your life together is going to be so earned and so worth it AND you’ll both be stronger for it! In the meantime you get to enjoy all the little things that most couples take for granted so much more! I really hope things work out for you both. For us, it’ll be 3-4 years until we can look at closing the gap, but like you I have every hope that if life doesn’t fuck us over, he’ll be my husband someday!

depression,eorw3xt,t1_eorsq4n,1558813799.0,"I feel you’re right, I’m not sure why it’s taken me so long to realise. I guess my problem is that I’m scared of counselling. I want to get better, but I’m scared to involve any kind of outside party. But at the same time I NEED to make a change. At the minute my bf is the only other person in this world who knows how I’m feeling and it’s a lot to put on one person and I can’t do that to him."
