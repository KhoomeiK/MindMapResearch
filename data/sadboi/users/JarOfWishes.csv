InsightfulQuestions,fokxt16,t1_fojfl3z,1587850989.0,"I mean mercy in the sense of not feeling a need to cause people pain or hardship for the sake of it, out of anger. I mean, I still get angry at situations sometimes but I don't think I deeply hate, because I know it could've been me all the same, and it's useless. I do believe in consequence, of course, but only for a constructive/protective sake, not out of hatred.  


The way I understand it is that most people are constantly slipping in and out of control and advantage across different parts of life, some swing a bit further and longer than others, either direction. I try to be mindful of that. I mean, I protect myself, I wouldn't say 'Sure, come live with me and do drugs in my house, it doesn't matter, not your fault'. But in day to day interactions, understanding how often we are at the mercy of circumstance does make it easier to not take things personally and just deal with the situation and move on. It turns things from infuriating into just tragic but ok."
InsightfulQuestions,fojdfyt,t3_g7rl6h,1587817597.0,"I think I do believe that, but predestination makes it sound like there was a purposeful plan, which I don't think there is. I see it similarly to dropping a rock down a hill; if you were to make a calculation based on all of the factors involved, you'll know exactly where it'll end up. Our minds make this more complex ofcourse, because it involves an insane amount of extra factors over a large time span. I think for there to truly be 'free will', we'd have to be divine and separate from this universe, exerting powers that don't follow the laws of maths and physics. I don't think we are, but maybe, who knows.   


I don't think it matters much anyway, because even if our thoughts and desires follow logical patterns, they're still ours and we're still free to act on them. I think it just changes the essence of how it was brought about, what it is. It does change the way I think about mercy though. It makes me see life a little bit more absurd, and helps me stay calm.   


One time I read an old saying, and it really struck me for some reason; ""There, but for the grace of god, go I"". I'm not religious, but for me it perfectly captured the reliance we have on circumstance, inside and out. Felt like a tribute to empathy and knowing the bounds of your ego.

Existentialism,fmhfaf0,t1_fmg5zuy,1586077742.0,"While I see what you mean with 'life doesn't play by any rules' and 'you will never hit anything that you don't fabricate for yourself', I do feel like that part of reality applies only for a specific kind of lifestyle. You need to be very emotionally independent and full of something to pull that off. 


The way I understand 'meaning' is that first of all, nothing makes sense in isolation. The more context there is, the easier it becomes to define things and see 'meaning' for yourself. Imagine a universe where it's just 1 object in a vacuum. What is it? No one knows. But add another object, and suddenly they both gain attributes in comparison. Context, you know? That effect, plus your life history, impulses, and social influences make you drawn to specific types of scenarios, etc etc. If everything goes right, that is.

 So to me so far, from what I've seen, it seems like a two-way street. Life gives you a mandatory context first(survival, socialisation, and educational institutions), and then you figure out what it means for you. Then afterwards a menu of selected contexts/stories and you pick one, or a few. (careers, social scenes, areas of interests, aesthetics, etc) Then afterwards you need to look for context yourself, because there's an endless amount of it out there, overlaid on daily life. (Invisible unless you're familiar with the patterns) But what happens when you can't connect or make anything of the context you're given anymore? To no longer be able to knit the loose ends into some sort of story you want to be in. 

That's the point where I recognize life has a thick overlay of all kinds of stories and contexts, but my head feels like it's a messed up radio receiving different stations every 2 seconds, or multiple at once. While, if you could only keep reception of one and concentrate, you might hear some songs, eventually a genre, etc. That's what I was talking about I suppose. When what you're given unravels, and stops being connected in any way to a bigger picture, and all events seem deconstructed and isolated with a lot of noise. 

But I can still see people listening to their favourite stations, switching sometimes, having their selection that expands and shrinks again with time. Patching together their stories and contexts, like a kind of collage. I know it's out there. I just can't seem to connect to it anymore. If that makes sense to you, that's how I see meaning. 

I had moments in my past where I could though. That's how I know what I see in others is real. There's that quote I like 'a man can do what he wants but not want what he wants', and I've felt that. The first time I played along with one of my favourite songs it gave me such a rush that I practiced for hours every day for months. That was a desire, I wanted it. When you want something, you somehow find everything you need to make it happen. It's like another sense gets added. You end up in strange places, but you find what you need. It's so fun and really strange. Eventually it left and I never felt it again with anything no matter how much time I spent. I want to want things but that's just not how it works. It's been about a decade, but I've been looking for it, I'll always be looking for it. Such is life. 

I'm very lucky I'm physically comfortable, I remember that every day. 

How do you see meaning, how has it functioned for you so far?"
Existentialism,fmfi6jj,t3_fuu52t,1586027763.0,"Yes. But not in a 'life is meaningless I don't want to be here' sense, but moreso in a 'Everything means so much and I'm sitting here unable to reach it, unable to internalise it'. Stuck with the drive to exist, to experience, to be filled with anything at all, but that energy has nowhere to go. No direction, just sickening emptiness. Like that little ball of life is bouncing against the walls of the empty room forever, not hitting anything. Like some sort of engine that's hollow inside. It's meant to do something, but it's just nonfunctional.   


Especially when people say 'just follow your heart!' makes me feel like I hopefully walked into an empty room, trusting to find something. However, then to be left horrified and nauseous at the sight that it is empty and I can't seem to fill it up no matter what I do. Whenever I try to force myself through it while trying loads of new things (hobbies, sports, activities, routine, etc) it's like that empty room is always superimposed over it all.

The dynamic that I think ruins it is that all abusers will seek power in one way or another, but good people don't necessarily seek power; it's not their priority. You need power over someone to hurt them. You don't need power over someone to be good to them. It creates a skewed balance. I feel like a lot of them are just professional abusers. For those types it was about ego, so they discard how they're tools of the law, and instead need to feel like they ARE the law. 'I don't like it, therefore you deserve punishment, FOR I AM GOD.

I think one of the worst quicksands in life is when you don't genuinely want anything, and your personality/life is driven by theoretical/detached/indirect interest, without practical intensity for anything you do.  I don't know yet if not wanting anything is just something someone is born with, or something that is (self)created."
BPD,fao1077,t1_fann90y,1576255083.0,"I'm the same way, I avoid forming any long-term dynamic with anyone. The way I see it is, it's not my fault, but it's still my responsibility. Some people would like to be able to use their legs but can't, I would like friends but can't. Everyone bears a burden, that's life. :/ It's been a bit longer than a year since I've made that decision, and it's been for the better."

depression,et2xmcj,t1_et2vhi8,1562424544.0,"I love those dreams. I get them too and I feel so lucky I get to live life and do things somewhere, even if it isn't reality. There are a lot of consistent elements/arcs/people/places in my dreams, making it seem more real. Depression doesn't really exist there. Is it like that for you too?"
