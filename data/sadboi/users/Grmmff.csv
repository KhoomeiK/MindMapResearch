I told her that I had just talked to the Dr earlier in the week and she said that she had a way for me to be tested without having a fever.

The nurse put me on hold and came back and said someone would contact me from the testing center shortly.  

I am absolutely confident that if I didn't have health insurance and a kick ass Dr that those tests wouldn't have happened.  Honestly, I don't think we medically needed to be tested because we aren't really all that sick. (Knock on wood).

Management decided not to tell them.  Decided not to tell their customers.  

And they haven't sent anyone home to be tested.

They are exposing people in mass to protect their profits.  They just didn't post a video about the fact they were going to infect everyone.

Edit: I've got some news for ya'll who think you can avoid the ""one"" store that has done this.  It's all the stores.  

Workers at grocery stores have been asking for multiple weeks:
 to be allowed to wear masks,
 to limit the number of customers who can come in the building,
 to require customers to wear masks
To be given hazard pay

As of a few days ago the only change is that workers can wear masks.  

So for the last 3 weeks all the workers have been exposed to all the people crowding in the stores panic buying.  

Are all those things true at your grocery store? Almost definitely.  

So yes, workers are getting sick at every grocery store right now.  But since tests still take forever to come back, they aren't shutting down the store so employees can be tested.  People with symptoms go home and people without them are working.

They are letting workers wear masks so the it decreases the likelihood of them infecting you. 

 Obviously not because they care about the safety of the workers.  The last three weeks proved that.  
And of course the fact that customers still aren't required to wear a mask of any kind.  

Go ahead and call your local grocery store and ask them if anyone is out sick.  I'm curious what you find out."
raisingkids,fml2ua0,t3_fvqwi1,1586177131.0,"Hi there, I'm a person with PTSD.  Although there isn't any reason to suspect that your child has ptsd, some of the things I know about getting back to sleep after a nightmare might be helpful.  

It is super awesome that you were able to be there to hold and comfort your child.  When I wake up from a nightmare the first thing I do is cuddle and pet my service dog whose is trained to lay on my chest and give kisses.  I bet love from a parent is interchangeable that.  Part of the goal here is to provide my body with an activity and physical sensation that brings my attention out of the dream and into the present.  

Then instead of trying to go right back to sleep, it's actually good to get up and move around a bit. You know how sometime if you wake up and go back to sleep really quick you can end up back in the same dream?  The way to avoid that is to spend some time out of bed.   Grab a glass of water, go to the bathroom.  And then if I feel safe, go back to sleep.

This leaves people with the much more expensive option of renting week to week in an extended stay hotel.  Other options include renting a house that isn't up to code but somehow isn't any cheaper than the market rate for a house that is up to code.  

 Not up to code may mean: exposed subflooring throughout the house, missing drywall, missing toilets or sink, no functioning refrigerator or stove, internal doors being used as external doors, leaking roof, rodent and insect infestation, boarded up windows etc.

The treatments you want to look for are cognitive behavioral therapy and EMDR.  Start with looking for a therapist that you connect with and make a weekly appointment.  (At least weekly). After you find someone you feel like you can work with you will spend some time learning and practicing grounding and self care routines.  you will learn and practice really good self care.  Excercise, eat fruits and veg, get as much sleep as possible, spend time in nature, spend time in community.  

The goal at this stage is to build you up and stabilize you in prep for EMDR.  This is also the time to start medication for any other underlying mental health issues you may have such as depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder etc.  

When you are ready and you are feeling stronger and more secure, add EMDR treatment.  This is normally done with a different therapist than the one you see every week.  The results from EMDR are amazing and it is hard, emotionally exhausting work.   EMDR helps your brain process your trauma out of the ""reliving"" part of your brain and into the ""memory"" part of your brain.  It's like it teaches your brain to tidy up.  And when your brain learns this skill it gets excited and starts looking for other things that need tidying.

To be truly successful you aren't going to be able to avoid those things from childhood that you would rather stay forgotten.  But when you get to that point, you'll be in control and you'll be ready."

2 cups shredded Cheddar Cheese (use whatever cheese you like.   mix some in but then cover it with a full layer) (there is almost definitely more than 2 cups of cheese when grandma makes this)

1 teaspoon dry mustard teaspoon sale(grandma version of teaspoon measured in cupped hand)

1/4 teaspoon onion power (or use chopped up onions instead)(the bit about chopped onions 8s probably a lie.  Better to stick to powder) (grandma version of 1\4 teaspoon measured in cupped hand)

salt and pepper to taste 

10 slices cook bacon, crumbled

1/2 cup fresh mushrooms, sliced

1/2 cup canned tomatoes, chopped, drain the juice

 a package of sausage, cooked and crumbled. AND drained (a package is one of those little plastic tubes of breakfast sausage)

Butter to grease casserole dish

Possibly also requires magic
 

This MUST be made the night ahead.  Ignore this at your peril.  Generously butter a 9 x 13 inch baking dish.  (Grandma version of generously)  Arrange bread cubs in dish and sprinkle with cheese.

 

Beat together eggs, milk, dry mustard, salt and pepper in a large bowl and pour evenly over cheese and bread.  Sprinkle with bacon, mushrooms, sausage, onions and the  tomatoes.

 

Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Bake casserole, uncovered, until set (it is like a custard so you need to test from time to time).  This is an unknowable amount of time that seems to change based on weather, oven and increases exponentially based on how many hungry people can smell it cooking. Test after 40 mins then every 5 mins afterwards.   Tent with foil if the top begins to get overly brown.

 

Yield:  8-10 servings.
Prep time: 24 hours (cube the bread in morning, let get stale all day, assemble in evening, let sit in fridge overnight, bake in morning

There is no harm in making an appointment.  And if you mention that you are a first responder they may try to work you in earlier.  

Make an appointment.  There is a huge difference in quality of life between untreated and treated PTSD.  There is a huge difference in the impact it will have on your family between treated and untreated PTSD."

I had a tibial plateau fracture and went to a shitty teaching hospital without insurance.  The student who put my cast on did it wrong.  So they had to cut it off.  But we waited so long for the actual Dr to come look at it and say it was wrong that my pain meds wore off.  

For some reason they couldn't give me pain meds in the cast room (probably because I was poor) so it really hurt.  

This happened twice.  And I left the hospital in a removable brace when I refused to let them try again."

Dallas,fge8acf,t3_exw7u5,1580693621.0,"I am from here, have lived all over the Dallas side of DFW and have lived with and without a car.  I have also used a scooter as my only vehicle.  

If you are going to live AND work near downtown, you don't need a car.  

If you live OR work anywhere outside of loop 12, you really will need a car or you will be totally socially isolated.  

You will pay more in rent to live close enough to a train station to avoid having a car.  You will also pay more for grocery delivery.  It's also likely that you will need to budget in some lyft rides.  This might be worth it depending on your lifestyle.  

I LOVED having a scooter instead of a car... Until I got hit by a truck.  (Never go to parkland hospital).  There are more scooters now than when I was riding and the increased presence makes this slightly safer.  

If you go the car route, get the cheapest reliable used car.  Ive been pretty pleased with the cars I got from the local CarMax.  Don't finance a warranty.  Also keep in mind that Dallas drivers are notoriously aggressive.  Consider whether you are a good enough driver to avoid an accident if a truck decides to make a u turn from the middle Lane directly on top of you.  (I was not).  Also consider whether you can afford full coverage insurance AND uninsured driver coverage.  You will really want to have uninsured driver coverage.  

My advice to a new graduate would be to look for a place downtown,uptown, north oak Cliff, somewhere within walking distance of a DART station and skip the car.  You will eventually want a car but if you hold off for a while you will have a better idea of where and how you want to live and what your budget will be."

How to ADHD


This channel has some great resources for setting up habits and routines that can support and ground you during treatment.  

As a person with both CPTSD and ADHD I have found that BY FAR the most helpful thing to do in my practice is to focus on grounding.  Use your senses a lot.   Build a ritual/routine  around a center you want to hold to. You will be able to come back to this center for hope and calm and security. 

 The seas of recovery are choppy and stormy.  Build a grounding meditation and ritual and you can open a place of peace and hope to recharge you for your journey."

neopagan,fe65bw8,t3_entj7j,1578882126.0,"There is Soo much variety and difference across different worldview that this is actually a really difficult question.  It's a question that would be difficult to answer in a multi page essay let alone a single Reddit comment.  That might be a big part of why you haven't had many responses.  

Think of the difference amongst Christian traditions or denominations.  There are even some Christian denominations like Unitarianism, Mormonism and Universalism that are so different that other Christians don't even think of them as even being Christian.  

If you are interested I learning more about different traditions,it would probably be more helpful to study or research each tradition in it's own right."

 Using a word with a meaning related to the spell makes it easier to remember.
