Felt like giving you some positive feedback because I know a lot goes into it. Really enjoying my listen to the EP. One I will find myself listening to again. It's such a fun record to listen to! 'Recycled' carried me on a wave, then 'Year 2000' lifted me up and I felt like moving to it. Then the next track just floors me with nostalgia and dreaming. Amazing eclectic mix!"

Beautiful shit man! Some great samples."

I have a further 30 VDP tracks in another playlist with a more chill mood, and a further 40 in a playlist of the more ambient stuff to fall asleep to. But I suggest you just go down the rabbit hole and get lost in it.

Also check out the 2814 albums for pure escapism, and the televape albums to get deep in the slush.

This site [http://lucidarchive.com/#/a/](http://lucidarchive.com/#/a/) is also a great resource to discover new stuff. Just have fun seeing what covers catch your eye and go from there. I've listened to most there and it's all good, can't go wrong with any of it. There are still countless albums not listed that really deserve a spot too, so its really an endless scene to explore. I envy you getting to experience all the classics for the first time.

And watch every telepath music video you can find!"
Vaporwave,ffaxq9p,t1_ffatiu0,1579746928.0,When I get a moment I'll PM you my favourites because it can be a daunting task to sift through them all. They are really as good as everything else he's done. I'm a mega fan of his work so it's all must-listen stuff to me but VDP has some really relaxing hidden gems.
Vaporwave,ffapx8c,t3_esjln5,1579741730.0,All of them bro. I was immediately gonna suggest everything by telepath but it looks like you have the right idea already. Also listen to his Virtual Dream Plaza stuff.
depression,ff4xmc1,t3_ererwo,1579574893.0,But you're not just taking it one day at a time. You're foreseeing every possible day ahead of you framed by how you currently feel. If you were truly taking it one day at a time you would practice being more present and live in the now.

depression,fdjudx7,t3_elqg7v,1578487810.0,"It sounds like you feel alienated and lack any sense of meaning in your life. I've been there and can empathize. I found out the only place I felt a sense of home was with the few people I felt closest to, and had a lot of memories attached to. When I couldn't feel a sense of belonging even there, I realized it was because I had such a low opinion of myself, that I didn't feel worthy of even being close to them. The people in your life probably don't really mind and appreciate you unconditionally. You don't feel good enough, and you feel so much pressure from how you relate yourself to the world, but it's really unreasonable if you're just trying your best. The people around you recognize your effort, but you can't shake the feeling of being a failure and a burden. You may lack something in your life that makes you feel like you have contributed, through your own talents and strengths. I also wonder how your social life is and how isolated you feel. If you can identify something to work towards to encourage growth in these areas of your life, hopefully you will start living with more hope for your future. So be patient. These are things only you can initiate, but don't despair, you are capable and worthy of all this, and I challenge you to see the journey ahead of you as one to be embraced, in all of its awkwardness and dullness and confusion and frustration. You deserve to feel good in the world, not stuck and uncomfortable, so hopefully you can start by receiving some love and kindness from yourself and others despite how low you see yourself and how shit every day feels. Remember that every undesirable thing happening to you doesn't set your value as a person. Its just the situation you're in. Hopefully by approaching your life in a more mindful and self-compassionate way, you can progress to even seeing the positive in the life you're already living. Take care bro."
