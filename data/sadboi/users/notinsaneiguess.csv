Emo,ffb1yat,t3_eslmxj,1579749759.0,"literally how i got into emo, dude! the first emo album i got into was lp2 by american football but i don't necessarily recommend it, i'd try diary by sunny day real estate. 

if you want a more familiar sound, try taking back sunday's first album, tell all your friends or full collapse by thursday. one album i really liked (and still do) is your favorite weapon by brand new. 

if you wanna find bands yourself, i'd suggest listen to 3rd wave bands at the moment, then iconic 2nd wave bands like mineral, texas is the reason, the get up kids, etc. if you are into punk too, try 1st wave emo bands like embrace, rites of spring or moss icon.

good luck and have fun! :\^)"

overcoming,f1v7xw3,t3_datm65,1569767912.0,"your mom could be right about using mental health as an excuse to treat people poorly. from personal experience, depression and anxiety have made me very self-centered and lonely. by doing nice things for your friends and focusing on making other people happy you will (potentially) 1. improve your relationships and 2. be less lonely/depressed. what your mom said was very harsh but if you think it's true, try viewing the situation objectively. try to remember that depression and anxiety are disorders and you have to focus on treating them."

overcoming,f0al9ab,t3_d4e86w,1568516018.0,"As a teenager, I can't possibly imagine the stress and expectations of work as my single AP class is making me feel incompetent, stupid like I'm incapable of relatively simple things. I'm so proud that you have made it this far in the career that you want, even if it's not going well that's such an accomplishment. Think of the education you went through and passed, getting hired at your job, staying in the position. Even if things are bad now, you've still made it so far and can't discredit that. If being a medical assistant is what you want to do, I know you will find a way to continue on, feel satisfied and productive. Best of luck"
