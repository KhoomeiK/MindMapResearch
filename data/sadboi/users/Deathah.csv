HOWEVER I have decided to put the mask away and be who I truly am. A very honest, ""facts dont care about your feeling"" type of guy, not an asshole but not sugar coating things either you know? Show the world who you truly are and if you loose people (GF included) man they were not worth it.

depression,f7ff5if,t1_f7febnd,1573678092.0,"Well ok I'll try to as objective as possible 
We have been dating for 3 years we meet at the mall because of a mutual friend and at the time she was with someone I was with someone both our exs where toxic evil people mostly hers, since he abused her and used her for sex and brainwashed the hell out of her, I shit you not 100% truth she thought a guy and girl hugging was an excuse for the guy to touch the girls boobs. You know I suffered through that the mistrust the constriction of ""you cant taln to girls because you cant have girl friends"" and shit and how I needed to be with her 24/7 I couldnt have a second to myself her. Her her and eventually she healed she got better and she knew right and wrong. I went through I guess a revenge phase? I felt like I get angry over stupid shit for ne reason this happened for about 2 months and she finally told me how she felt and I knew I was doing wrong so I got better and did better, she went through a period where she couldnt find a job maybe 

5 or 6 months and you know I paid her things and made sure she could eat and shit, then she got a job, got fired because of bias bitches on there and for about 1 month more she didnt have a job until she landed a job as a security guard, she made it sound like the life and was being paid 13 while I was 10 so I decided to apply for security and quitted my 10/hr job without having a concrete yes from a security position so I didnt get it and went for about 1 year without a job granted in that time I did got to a technical IT school for about half the that time but it was so fast they wanted you to know the ins and out of a computer both software and hardware in 1.5 weeks, so I didnt much I left with more knowledge then I came in but i wasn't ready for anything IT. Then I got a job because of the IT school lasted 2 months because A) it was in Browars from Miami and B) the pay wasn't worth it. So I quit and then I found this clerk job, dafnne quit her security job and went to work for a

Company dealing with Doners and dead bodies she didnt last long because of bullying bitches and she quit I told her to quit her father told her to quit I'd pay for anything she needed gave her money, and then around 4 days before Halloween I got into a fist fight with my brother, he called the cops on me and I got arrested, now I'm paying for a lawyer coming out of my pocket to hopefully get the charges dropped, because I was just defending myself. So i am under stress about being deported, jailed, criminal record, whatever. I'm only making 11/hr so money for me is tight and then she wakes up one weekend crying ""I have a dilemma"" basically she doesnt know if she has to leave or stay because I have no future I am not studying and shit. So I convinced her to stay and that was 2 weeks ago before monday the day she really left. Everything was good I even told her the exact same monday that wait until this level battle is over. And we can move out. Then a couple hours later she says she 

Cant handle living with my mother. How she invades her privacy, how the house is always dirty, (granted i cleaned my room more often than she did and made it stay clean) and how I am not studying so she doesnt see a future with me where I do anything and shit, and she has to leave for herself and this is the best choice for her.
I told her ""please wait a couple months so I can finish this and we can go"" and she said ""unfortunately I dont want to"" Dude she became the avatar man ""when the world needed her most she vanished"" I'm going through all this shit and just to have her go. Then she texts me saying it was for someone else so we talk. And I swear to you man I beg her to come back I cry I promise her if she wants to move out and that means I have to live off 100 dollars every 2 weeks I'd do for her I'd fucking do anything for her, fucking begging bro that I'd go to school and ANYTHING and she says ""too little too late you had 3 years and why didny you stop me when I left"" it's like 

You broke up with me and your complaining I didnt stop you? How is that fucking logical? I'm trying now right I'm begging for you to come back? Isnt this worth. something? I have told her time and time again, ""You do not owe me anything"" and its true I fixed you because I wanted too I healed you and dealt with your bullshit because I knew the flower you were and I wanted you to get there to live the rest of my life with, I just asked for 1 last chance and she didnt give it. So 11/6/2019 I went to her parents house dropped off all the stuff she left, clothes, collectables, etc and I talked to her dad a little telling him to watch out for his daughter
To make sure she eats
That she doesnt know when someone has a mask and is only pretending to be nice to get something from you or something
Thay she needed a new laptop for school because her chromebook is ass, 
How she cried for her father when he did something stupid and hurt her.
And her father told me she living with a ""friend"" from 

Work when in reality she told me she got a stranger to help pay Bill's, but then he said she is living in kendall and I know one of her good friend live over there so I'm assuming she is living with him AND she said she paid 3 months rent and is on a lease which is why she cant leave that home and move in with me somewhere else, so I am assuming she lied to me in regards to her living situation and just didnt want me anymore I balled my eyes out yesterday but told myself that would be the last time I'd do for her. 

She also started saying that in that 1 year I wasn't working I was using her and shit and how I just didnt care for her because I knew she wouldn't leave and crap, and it's like I never asked her for money I don't ask anyone for money I did feel lazy and I did fuck up but I wouldn't use her I accept that year was 100% my fault and shit but for her to say I used her and I just didnt give a fuck about her and shit. That's a lie I'm not evil, and also when she said she'd break up with me at around like 12 :21 pm right? When I left work at 5:30 but realistically it was around like 5:43 or something I changed my FB picture and status to indicate I'm single because I was she broke up with me, she said it herself. And then she says ""it was easy for you to change your FB"" and it was fucking not man i was tearing up doing that shit it was fucking easy at all, and she did it too, after mine, but what was I suppose to do? Keep her there and constantly be reminded of what i lost? Who i lost? 

The pain? The regret? Like if you say we are breaking up that means were done right? Like why are you so fucking full of it saying it was easy? No man I'm trying to move on because I you already packed your shit and left, you moved in with someone you OUT! what can I fucking do except move on? Right? Like how am I the evil one... it just wasn't right as I said I'm in a legal battle I fucking needed her now more than fucking ever and she decided to leave me because that was her breaking point... how in the FUCK! am I the asshole in this story man? Anything she wanted? I'd do my best to give it to her, anything at all, she didnt like something she wanted me to change ? I'd change I'd do better, more romantic more sexual more whatever. I gave her complaints every fucking day I was there when her father fucked up, her friends fucked up, when she fucked up, and now when I FUCKING NEEEDED HER MOST, SHE FUCKING LEFT! and I'm not angry man, I'm depressed, I miss her but I dont want to because 

I know she will move on, and I will have to as well. And the IT job? It wasn't me just sitting in a comfy desk it was me fucking going to places getting on ladders, inspecting the tiles removing tiles, powertooling through walls, I was in fucking attics bro, attics in miami!! You know that fucking heat!? Come dirty as fuck full of fiberglass and insulation! like it was basically fucking construction work, and even then I still did laundry, I still cleaned the fucking room, I still found time for her, I didnt play my ps4 those days just to fucking be with her like shit man, I did a fucking lot for this women and for her just to up and leave in my most crucial moment. That's just wrong man

Funny part is there is this guy named sabastian, he was another IT guy she met in school, government job, likes to dance and go out into anime, and etc I asked her (because he flirted with her a lot and got desperate to where he showed up to her work once even though she never told him where she works and she lied to me saying she was going to the gym but she went to his house for 3 hours and lied to me about going there and what they did and to this day idk what they did for 3 hours so she blocked him) if we break up would she go talk to him and she said yes, he basically likes everything she does, I guess he'd be a good fit for her, too desperate in my opinion but yea I'm sure that's where shell go. Good for her"
