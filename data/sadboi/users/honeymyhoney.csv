migraine,fmfx951,t1_fmfup0i,1586036760.0,"I’ve never heard of either of those machines before ( ya think I would have) , I’m looking on amazon for that tens machine right now, I’m seriously considering trying that."
migraine,fmfmva4,t3_fuy3zy,1586030589.0,"Things that help me when I can’t get my hands on medication:

-Taking a hot shower in the dark (steam is a big key here)
-sipping tea with eyes closed. Keep mug pressed near lips or cheek in between sips. The heat helps me find a comfort in my face/head area. Helps me take my mind off head pain.
-bag of ice and a sock filled halfway with rice. Warm the rice sock in the microwave. Alternate the ice bag and the warm rice sock at the base of the skull. 1-2 minutes for each. 
-I’ll put an audio book on (or radio) and have the volume turned to where I can hardly hear it. I then lay down however comfortable in the dark ( usually engulfed in pillows), and try to focus on listening and paying attention to the audio book. 9 times out of 10 I nod off and when I wake up my migraine isn’t as bad.
-rub icy hot on temples and neck (kinda strange but the tingling of the cream kinda short circuits the pain a bit) careful not to get it in your eyes or mouth.

Things that other people SAY helps them but does not help me but you might as well try anyway:

-rubbing your temples or wherever the agony is greatest.
-Stretching your neck
-drinking ice water
-do yoga
-rub peppermint under your nose
-take a multivitamin and over hydrate.

I hope at least one of these may help you. Being without medication sucks."
sleep,fk3dnd2,t3_fg7llj,1583828358.0,"I really don’t think there is to be honest. Sleep is pretty necessary for us. 
Tricks to keep us awake can only do so much.
I would work on trying to get the highest QUALITY 6 hours of sleep you can. (Preferably more than 6 but you take what you can get) and focus on that over trying to find tricks to function better.

Good for you, working on that education by the way.

Edit: not exactly what you were looking for, However it’s still an interesting read on sleep deprivation among college students. If only to urge you to see sleep as a healthy necessity instead of a time consuming obstacle.
Best of luck to you.

Anxiety,f2ndkmm,t3_ddl8a7,1570314740.0,"Sharing a kitchen really sucks. Like... It's not just you. It really does suck. I'm sharing a kitchen at the moment and I live off of canned soup and frozen meals now because the stress of cooking just isn't worth it. 
Golden: canned soup. Frozen dinners. Nut bars. Protein shakes/ powder in your own little mixer cup that you clean and keep in your room."
StopSelfHarm,ezlu247,t1_ezd8239,1567981574.0,That’s a good process
StopSelfHarm,ezlifpg,t3_d1e2f7,1567977130.0,"The other day I was having a bad time of it. I felt lost. I felt angry at...everything. 
I don’t cut, I smash things into my upper thighs. It’s easier to hide and I can always come up with an excuse.
But the other day I wanted to take my phone and smash it on my thighs.
I didn’t. 
I did grab a bath towel and squeeze and twist the ever loving stitching out of it until I had ridden through that wave.

The point is, you’re not alone. 
You are not alone even though you feel alone. 

I mean, sure you are physically alone cuz every other person who self harms is not standing over your shoulder watching you. But I mean, that you are not the only one experiencing this awful...feeling.

Good job on 9 months. I haven’t been able to go 2 months without at least one new self inflicted bruise. 

Some day I will be able to go as long as you, and some day we both will finally learn how to ride that wave for good and learn how to grow from pain."
depression,ezlewjl,t3_d1cexd,1567975858.0,You’ve got this! Self care is an important step to feeling better:)
depression,ez5xrny,t1_ez5eqhb,1567706583.0,"Oh gosh I am in the SAME exact boat. My fiancé started showing symptoms of depression about a year ago. ( we have been together for 8 years so I know how he used to act/think) Now however...sometimes, the things he say to me... they scare me so much and sometimes I fear that I’ll come home from work and find him dead. Often I come home from work at 7pm and he hasn’t left the bed all day. Or sometimes I find him lying on the floor in tears, sobbing about how awful life is and how he just feels this overwhelming discomfort, shame, and the feeling of self hatred. Just last night we were talking about therapy or going to the doctor. He absolutely refuses. Not because he does want help, but because “ he needs it to me me who understands him”. Which is bull, I know he’s terrified of the doctor. I tell him I’ll be with him , literally right next to him every step of the way. I’ll hold his hand. I tell him that he’s my life and I need him. 

I tell him that I understand that he’s having awful  intrusive thoughts that take over his mind. I tell him that I’m here anytime he needs to talk but I can’t be more than a bandaid because I don’t know HOW to help. Depression is a beast. It’s scary. 

When I suggest going for a walk ( with me) or watching a movie, or anything that might give his thoughts a rest, he gets angry and upset that “ I don’t understand “ and he will shut himself in the bathroom and leave me worrying what he’s doing. 
I want to hold him but he doesn’t like to be touched anymore.  He puts a pillow between us when we sleep. He says if he touches me he will cry. Sometimes I force it, and he does cry, but he acts more normal for a few hours after he cry’s.



Well... he’s right about one thing, I don’t understand. I don’t understand what to do...but I’m not giving up. I’m going to keep trying. I’m hoping that he will be able to pull himself out ( because I don’t think I can pull him out myself, he keeps fighting me). The best thing I can do is be there and keep trying. That’s the only thing anyone can do is keep trying. 
I have also started going to therapy for myself about 6 months ago. I feel it’s important to mention that. My therapist has helped me immensely in learning how to handle my situation.

Good luck to you and your fiancé."
