PCOS,fpyd5dv,t3_gg1v7v,1589001692.0,"I’ve experienced this too but I’m bipolar. I remember reading a study that there’s a connection between PCOS and mood disorders. 

If you feel concerned you might also want to look up Cyclothymia - it is a mini version of bipolar. A lot of my anxiety was caused my mood swings and I couldn’t get any relief until I got treatment for my mood disorder. 

If you suspect this is the problem, it’s okay! I know it’s scary to think of another diagnosis but you’ve always been you - and that won’t change. Looking into things will just help you get some relief. Hope you’re doing okay now and figure out what’s going on ❤️❤️"
PCOS,fomhkb5,t3_g821zl,1587890282.0,"Congrats on your accomplishment! PCOS can be so discouraging and confusing. You were determined not to give up and find what works for you! 

Recently lost 7 lbs and started to tear up. I had never lost weight before. I finally feel like my body is starting heal - anxiety has almost gone away, my hair is growing back, learning to self love again. This disease can be so difficult to manage and hearing your progress is so encouraging 💪 

Hope you’re feeling happier and healthier 🥰"

BipolarReddit,flek8vr,t3_fo7jfd,1585085995.0,"Not sure if this will help but... I had a lot of problems with going on meds. I felt like my personality changed and I lost interest in the things I loved. 

Eventually I talked to my psychiatrist and she lowered my dosage and it helped a lot! It’s not perfect but it helped me find a better balance with still being myself and being in control of my own body. 

It might be worth a try mentioning it to your doctor. They might be able to help you more than you think."

BipolarReddit,fko5kth,t3_fjhbt6,1584380543.0,"I’m sorry you’re going through this. I’ve been inside for 4 days now and am having a really hard time. I feel trapped and having a really bad manic episode. I feel awful - I keep yelling at family members and it’s adding more stress to them. 

Somethings that are helping a bit are taking up new hobbies, finding creative projects, reading, and mini dance parties in my room. I’ve also been taking a run outside a day because I’m not coming in contact with people or touching anything. I think it’s really hard for us when our coping mechanisms get stripped away. Stay strong and we’ll get through this!"
bipolarart,fjkkssa,t1_fjjlxr9,1583428742.0,Thanks! That means a lot
bipolarart,fjkkgzv,t1_fjka858,1583428564.0,Go ahead and post it! It was more therapeutic for me and I work in an industry that doesn’t take too kindly to mental illnesses so I’d rather be anonymous 😉
bipolarart,fjj589y,t3_fcny08,1583383704.0,This is awesome! Love it!
bipolarart,fjj52yy,t1_fjj357o,1583383589.0,Thank you!!
PCOS,fegx6g4,t3_eozv2r,1579104529.0,"My doctor said mine was from anxiety (caused by PCOS) and she recommended working out in the morning/early afternoon (apparently it gives you more energy during the day but helps you fall asleep faster/gives you better quality sleep), cutting out caffeine and turning off electronics an hour before bed. Worked like a charm!"
bipolar2,f9gs3d3,t3_e4zo1n,1575303933.0,"My psychiatrist told me that weed momentarily elevates your mood and decreases anxiety (I used to smoke to avoid panic attacks) but it can trigger an episode the days after from a chemical imbalance in your brain. Over time it can make your swings worse, especially manic episodes. 

I didn’t really listen to her because everything seemed fine and I thought it didn’t really apply to me. Then I started getting hallucinations during mania and things got pretty ugly. When I stopped smoking I stabilized and things got a lot better. 

I still smoke once in a while because I can’t drink on my meds but I’d just say be really careful with it and if you have a psychiatrist talk to them about it."
bipolar2,f60uj3o,t3_dq3h5v,1572626335.0,"I think everyone experiences mania a little differently but for me it’s really the inability to feel fear. 

Like imagine coming off a depressive episode feeling incredibly insecure and then all the sudden every fear or insecurity you’ve ever had vanished. It’s like the colors become brighter and life seems so vibrant and fun. When I’m in mania I have the energy to do every exciting thing I can think of and I usually get a huge burst of creativity. It’s like extreme version of living in the moment and not worrying about what comes next. 

For me, it usually starts with having a lot of creative ideas or wanting to do something super spontaneous. Where I get in trouble is the feeling is so overwhelming that it seems like it’s so exciting that I can’t not do it. I’m not afraid of anything so why not do every reckless thing I can think of. 

Although fear isn’t a pleasant feeling it’s what keeps us safe. It helps us think more long term figure out how our actions will affect us later. Without it, it’s very dangerous. I think that when we do destructive things it’s not because we don’t care. It’s because in that moment we don’t have the ability to understand that it’s not always going to work out fine. It’s really hard to give that feeling up but it’s necessary for us to so we don’t hurt those around us or ourselves."
BipolarReddit,f4ekerq,t3_dkfwtu,1571559277.0,I always do this when I’m in hypomania but I think it’s pretty cool. Like we’re channeling all that energy into something creative and beautiful
bipolar,f4b064k,t1_f47knfh,1571504465.0,"For me I’ve had more success waiting a bit to tell someone I’m dating. I think when people have more time to get to know you it’s easier for them to understand that stigmas aren’t true. 

I also had a therapist recommend staying confident and calm while brining it up and being clear that it’s a part of me but it doesn’t define me. After I took her advice everyone has been really supportive. 

I did have a first date once where I blurted it out and they definitely fetishized it. Kept saying we’d have “crazy” sex and shit."
bipolar,f1dzgka,t1_f1999b6,1569407104.0,I had some minor side affects before I found the right one for me. It can take time to find the right fit for you but keep your head up and keep going. I’m on Lamictal with next to no side effects and it feels great to be in control of myself. After I got stable I worked a lot with Mindfulness and was able to get my dosage down a bit which also helped the side effects a lot. The process is different for everyone but it will be worth it in the end
