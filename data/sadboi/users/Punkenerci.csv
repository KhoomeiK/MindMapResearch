Not sure so much yet on what's next for Buddie...I truly think it could go either way. 

If they do not become cannon..that is OKAY because their friendship is so different and non toxic in terms of masculinity and what's on tv today. They are both so close and vulnerable with each other and care deeply for each other. 

Would it be lovely if their friendship blossomed into more? Of course. 

Little tiny micro facial expressions seem to indicate more...OR we, the stans could be looking too into it.

But for instance, last night...Eddie's face when he realizes who Abby is...that is some straight up emotion...

I'd love for them to be cannon..sucks we have to wait until 2021 to find out!!!

Male eating disorders need more exposure and need to be talked about. I've (F) dated a couple of different guys with eating disorders and they were ashamed and embarrassed and if it was brought up they shut down immediately...and this was back in the early-mid 2000s.

Speechless. Intimidated. I was not planning to bother her when she was clearly taking a minute to herself after meet and greets.....

But...
My friend literally shoved me over and the following conversation arose..

Me: *hem* ""excuse me...Omg Brooke Lynn I love you!""

Brooke: smiles kindly 

(and my goodness is she larger than life compared to 5'4 me) 

Me: ""thank you for coming here...you're my favorite. You should have won..""

Me: *begins shaking* ""sorry to bother you, may we please get a picture? I missed the meet and greet.""

Brooke: *huge smile..perfectly white, straight teeth*

Me: *waits..almost passes out*

Brooke: ""Oh honey, of course! You're so cute.""

Me: *blushes and melts into a puddle*

A few more exchanges of friendly conversation and I politely excused myself to give her some time alone before she went on...

AMAZING SHOW. 

My entire life was made that night. 

She literally could have turned my friend and I away but she was the sweetest...I was already a fan but now I'm a Stan for life.

I've never sought professional help and obviously this is why I'll never recover.

I'm almost 34..

I've never been able to eat in moderation or diet healthily. Over the last few months I've dropped 50 lbs from my highest weight ever from over exercise and basically starvation.

Executive producer Tim Minear told TVLine at the time. “And I’m not saying that the fountain shooting up behind them meant anything metaphorically. You decide.”

🤔 interesting. 

I definitely ship Buddie. BUT the cast and crew being verbally harrassed and bullied is NOT okay. Some people get psychotic about these ""ships"" and take it to extremes..

As much as I would love Buddie to become a thing, it is not the end of the world if they don't. The actors have amazing chemistry and the writers obviously acknowledge and play off of that...

My personal thoughts? I feel like the breadcrumbs we've been given are potentially leading to a romantic partnership. So many little moments. BUT obviously just MY opinion and speculation on my end...

Buck asks Eddie if Christopher is the reason he doesn't date. Eddie says ""that"" and comments how they were ""not his type"" then he LITERALLY for .2 seconds gives Buck a LOOK. What a mood!

Buck's constant eyelash fluttering at Eddie and thirsty af looks. 

The elf mistaking them for a couple and Buck not correcting her.

When they have argued, it is like a married couple. 

During the kitchen scene in 3x9..umm EXCUSE ME, HENNY..THE SEXUAL TENSION WASSSS THROUGH the roof. Jesus Christ.

Eddie's major heart eyes after commenting he would ""never do that"" as in take a swing at Buck.

""I could still take you."" ""You think so?""

Tell me that's not flirting and code speak for sexy time.

Also...let's talk about Eddie's body language in that entire scene...his arms are behind him. He does not move away as Buck closes in. He is not guarded or uncomfortable. He does not have his arms over his chest. His stance is inviting. Not to mention his intense gaze toward Buck. 

I seriously thought they were going to kiss.

Also 3x10..the soft af look Eddie gives Buck as he makes gingerbread houses with the kids.

Anything I missed that anyone would like to contribute?

As much as I ship them...PLATONICALLY close, close relationships between two men are 100% fine and very important to portray in media to fight off the stigma of toxic masculinity...

That concludes my tedtalk. Thanks for coming.
