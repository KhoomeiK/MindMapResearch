femalehairadvice,et6z444,t1_et6vzev,1562521788.0,"Appreciate this advice! A few questions: I’ve always had a hard time finding a “good” salon to go to. I found a “good” one locally and then my jaw hit the floor when it came time to pay and it was $450. what do you look for when searching? are there good resources (besides yelp, google, etc) to help? 

Also, do you have any recommendations on how someone what isn’t in the hair industry can learn about the basics of hair lightening/coloring?"
femalehairadvice,et6u1co,t3_ca8yic,1562519310.0,"Yesterday, I decided to bleach the top half of my hair after not doing anything to that area for the past year. I absolutely adore the bottom half of my hair (purple area) but i HATE the yellow/orange/pinky color of the top - right now i am so anxious i want to throw up. 

left photo - this morning

right images:
Photo 1 - this is what i started with. 

Photo 2, after Round 1 - salon care 40 volume creme developer with prism lite blue by saloncare. Added the ion absolute perfection step 1 & step 2. Left on for 20 min. 

Photo 3, after Round 2 - salon care 20 volume creme developer with color charm wella t14 toner, and color charm  wella 050 additive. Put this on and saw it was making things look SUPER dark and was making my scalp hurt like crazy, so i hopped in the shower and rinsed it out. 

I used various purple shampoos (the generic clariol purple, viral brand purple, and another brand, i forget right now) between yesterday and today to help get some of the brass out, which is why the bottom half is so purple.  

NOW - I am headed on a trip for the next 2 weeks and would really like to feel pretty. What should I do?

Ideas:
- go purple on top and let it fade to the light purple at the bottom. I am afraid that with it being so orange-y, the purple color will be really muddy and dark. 
- repeat round 1 (bleach more) and see if that helps, then repeat round 2. 
- just repeat round 2 (try the toner again, without the 050 additive)
- cry, then find a random hair salon near where i am staying on my trip and beg for help/forgiveness"
