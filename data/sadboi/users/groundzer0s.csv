From what I know, there's no substantial history to the building itself.

As a teenager I avoided doing dishes during the day since I enjoyed listening to music, but my parents would always try and talk to me and would get mad at me for not responding despite knowing I was wearing headphones. To combat that, I stared doing dishes at night, usually around 1:00 AM. I lived with a hoarder, my step mom, so the kitchen space was tight. There was one way in and out of the kitchen, a narrow opening between a bookcase and a microwave stand. The first time I saw it I had just turned to put a plate in the dishwasher when I saw a black figure reflected in the microwave, but when I looked up, there was nothing. I swore it was there, but I brushed it off and kept doing the dishes. But I felt nervous, on edge, and I kept seeing it. Always in my peripheral vision, that black figure would stand in that space between the bookcase and the microwave stand, perfectly still. It happened so frequently that I just had to force myself to get used to it. Looking back, considering how it was around my height and size, and my deep emotional connection with my aunt who I never met, I wonder if it could have been her. It was just crazy to me how it happened every time I did dishes, which was once every other day roughly. It was both the most prominent and mundane thing that happened while I lived at my dad's. The other stuff... Yeah I dunno what that stuff was about. I just can't believe I accepted it all as normal back then."
