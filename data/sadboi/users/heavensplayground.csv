AnxiousAttachment,fcyncns,t3_ejgylu,1578083277.0,"Call whatever counseling practice and ask. Not all therapists understand attachment theory because many have a general understanding of it. When you meet with a therapist be sure to ask ‚Äúwhat is your theoretical approach‚Äù If they say ‚Äúeclectic‚Äù don‚Äôt go to them. 
My therapist is amazing and has 30 years of experience and I‚Äôm happy I found her. But, I‚Äôve worked with therapist who never mentioned attachment, and just reflected my feelings. I had one therapist send me home with a packet of homework and that didn‚Äôt help at all. 
Just be sure to ask and say what you‚Äôre looking for"

relationship_advice,fchhorl,t1_fchfgc3,1577650584.0,"Those are all great questions. I was embarrassed.   I‚Äôm on the shy side to begin with and I have some social anxiety. 

The two of them have a kid together and the kid stays with him mostly. His ex comes around a lot for the kid. She also asks him for a lot of favors and he‚Äôs very non confrontational so he will usually say yes. He‚Äôs a ‚Äúyes man‚Äù for the most part. 

I should also mention his ex wife is pregnant with her fianc√©s baby, and her fianc√© is out of town a lot for his job. 

As far as my own triggers go, I was in a serious relationship with a guy for 3 years that was in love with his ex the whole time. I found naked pictures of her on his computer and that‚Äôs what ruined the relationship. It was a long time ago, but it‚Äôs still sore."

My best friend also has an anxious attachment so I check in with her. We check in with each other. She will point out things that help calm me down. 

I‚Äôm in a new relationship and he‚Äôs military so he‚Äôs not always available. He also gets withdrawn when he‚Äôs really stressed. My bff helps so much.
