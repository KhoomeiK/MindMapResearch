It sucks because I don't have the skills I need as an adult to be an adult. I go to therapy. I take my meds. I still get severe symptoms but Medicaid won't pay for a good doctor. They kind of just throw pills at you and expect you to be ok. Before I got on disability,I lost so many jobs because of my illness. Someone finally understands.❤️"

trashy,evmho2d,t1_evmhe29,1564608169.0,Anger and rage is a huge part of bipolar. So I'm a horrible person because I have anger issues and can't help the idea that my brain is sick? Good job with stigma. Being a lier is a manipulative trait. That has nothing to do with bipolar. But anger absolutely is. So is mania and depression.

I didn't have a chance untill I figured out the way I act is a reflection of me. My mother had severe schizofrina,and my father was a heroin addict. Life experiences kind of forced me to take control of my illness. I started to look up videos on YouTube,and here. I wanted to educate myself. Medicaid and insurance from the state doesn't pay for good therapy. And meds is also required with this illness. Sad but it is true that inside I feel like she does. I just maintain it."

I walk away now. Being proactive in mental health and self awareness is hard work with this disorder because you litterly feel as if you will explode if you don't let it out.
I remind myself it's not needed. I walk away and smoke a cigg. Then I will explain my feelings. This woman is manipulative apparently."
