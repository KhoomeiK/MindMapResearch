Your complaining about him killing himself is selfish yet you expecting him to suffer with what their going through just to live for you isn't selfish on your part? As someone who struggles to not kill myself its pretty selfish of everyone around me to expect me to live just for the sake of THEIR OWN HAPPINESS. WTF about us? I lost two very close people to me to suicide yet I never once thought they were selfish, I just wish I had noticed and did something in time. Can't understand how people think its not selfish to expect someone to live for their happiness even if that means the person has to suffer."

So fact is 995 perps walk free and 995 victims will not get their justice.   


Get a good lawyer do not use free attorneys unless you want her lawyer to get you convicted of a crime you didn't do. Keep that evidence safe that combined with your lawyer will make this case go smooth and quick.   


Also not having a rape kit done isn't really evidence as it's not an easy thing to spread your legs in a room with 2-3 strangers examining you after going through something horrific. Theirs been many cases were a victim will refuse a rape kit for personal reasons.   


DO NOT KILL YOURSELF, I say this because it will make you really guilty."
