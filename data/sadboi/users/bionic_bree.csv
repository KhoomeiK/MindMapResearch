There's no reason to be scared to bring up a particular medication as part of your regular appointment. Good luck!"

I was still feeling the after shocks today, like little electric currents running through me. They throw my balance off, and I'm so embarrassed because I could barely talk yesterday st work. I was slurring and stuttering so much that everyone was giving me the side eye. My meds recently changed, so I think that's what it is.
