He’s a a true rockhound, gem hunter, dealer for over 55 years.  He has long long term relationships with the miners around the world.  He’s had  this particular stone for over 40 years. It was gifted to him by the owner of the mine.  He’s been watching me coveting it for many years, and finally he thought it time to turn it over to me for safe keeping.  So now,  I’m fortunate  enough to be the steward of this stone, and will keep for as long as I have eyes to look after it.."
