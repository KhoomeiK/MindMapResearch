JaneTheVirginCW,fr39nc4,t3_gmdkwm,1589852759.0,I feel like Jane is the type of person who KNOWS she’s the main character. Almost every time she’s messed up everyone has forgiven her. I think she takes that for granted and sometimes misinterprets it as extra room for her to mess up. In a way that’s a really relatable part of her character.

I’m not sure if you are actually feeling worthless or commented it just as a passing remark, but in case it was serious or anyone reading this does think that, I just wanted to say: it’s alright not to have amazing EC’s to get into a great school, as long as you did the best you could with what you had. That’s all any of us can do, and, let’s face it, some people have more than others. The college you go to and the success you have as a developing teenager in highschool does not necessarily determine the course of your life."
