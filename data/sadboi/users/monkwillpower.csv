You need to man up for one moment. Ask her whether or not she's in love with him. If you are such close friends, then you would know by your intuition that she is or not okay with him. If you don't... then your fear. Who knows what will happen."

But according to my research, if you can not see any depth in the things around you, you force optimism in yourself. I'm not saying to be **too optimistic** thinking that life is full of flowers, and rainbows. That's wrong, it isn't. Suffering is a natural occurence in life, and you have to persist through it all. Regardless of how painful it is. *EVEN* if you hit rock bottom, losing your job, money, losing your family, relatives, friends, and maybe everything that you had. There are people who rose from rock bottom all the way to the 1% of society. I'm also not saying to become the 1% but instead become 100% of yourself. Where your ideal self, and real self are no different. Except for anything else which you can not control.


If everything feels dull, and don't want to engage. You want to do the littlest thing possible which can make your day just a bit more productive. To do that you must not say to your mind, ""Fuck this, fuck that, this shit is horrible."" Remember to force  enough optimism in yourself, that you're willing to do it. How? Well, say, ""JUST FUCKING DO IT! DON'T GIVE UP! IF I DO THIS ONE THING, MY DAY WILL HAVE BEEN 1% MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN ALL THE OTHER DAYS."" That 1% is what matters the most. The 100%? No. That is the result of suffering, tears, maybe blood, and maybe sweat.  What I'm telling is that do baby steps. Don't do **HUMONGOUS** steps. That will not work! For some people it will. But not for us! What will work is that you try your best in every baby step! For those baby steps are what makes your life become the greatest it will always be!

I hope you take my advice seriously, and if you don't, it doesn't matter. What matters is you read this, and that I tried my very best to help another person, and
