AskReddit,fdhb8xc,t1_fdhb17j,1578419277.0,"I’m talking about moments that just feel perfect! Where you are plainly happy, or the moment makes perfect sense to you and nothing about it could be different to make it better. Harmony, I guess. Or a feeling of complete satisfaction."
BPD,fdh6w5x,t1_fdgs4p5,1578416675.0,"Hahah this made me laugh. I can really relate. It reminds me of a friend I have who will set up his phone in his bathroom and take a video of himself just standing in front of it for a few minutes. He watches it to see himself from an outside perspective and to gage his mannerisms and his facial expressions and stuff and whether or not he seems approachable. I love this side of being human, this confusion and the attempt to see ourselves in a way that we just can’t from our first person perspective."

dating_advice,f9ha564,t3_e52dxj,1575311681.0,"Conversation can be so easy if you really listen to what the other person has to say and are genuinely interested in who they are. Pay attention to them, acknowledge what they say and make relevant observations to show you appreciate and are invested in the time they’ve devoted to talk with and open up to you, ask questions, invite them to expand on things they mention. Inquire into the things that interest them, ask them about their family, what they’re friends are like, what they enjoy about what they do, etc. Basically, what their lives are like in all the detailed and nuanced ways. Ask yourself what you want to know about a person, what information is interesting and valuable for you to discover. When you do this, conversation unfolds organically.

Sometimes I come across as a little interrogative because of how many questions I ask, so be conscious that you’re not probing them and that you’re also offering insight into yourself in response to the direction your chat is going. It should be an exchange. but ultimately I think questions are essential to a fluid and continuous conversation. If you express sincere curiosity into who it is that’s sitting across from you, the conversation will take the lead itself, then naturally all you have to do is just follow it.

Also, silences might very well happen even in an engaging conversation. It’s okay, especially if you’re meeting up for the first time. I choose to find it endearing, the awkwardness of getting to know a new person. If they become someone you really enjoy spending time with and want to continue spending time with, the silences can become really profound moments of intimacy. I personally enjoy watching the shyness evolve into trust over time, noticing how we adjust to one another and how the safety we establishing with each other affects the way I connect to and share space with them.

Good luck! Just be sincere and it will go well."
dating_advice,f9drgqo,t1_f9diwcb,1575236179.0,why don’t either of you want to hear about it? are you really not interested at all? do you avoid it because it engenders negative feelings in yourself or for a different reason?
dating_advice,f9dmn2t,t1_f9cyuro,1575234926.0,"I don’t think I clearly cannot handle that conversation. I don’t want to eliminate a conversation about who this person is, this entire facet of their being and their history, just because I am insecure. I want to be exposed to all that has fundamentally contributed to this person as I know them. I don’t want to exclude myself from this essential side to them because of my sensitivities. Especially this romantic dimension, which has so much to do with the dynamic and context in which we are coming to understand each other. I want to know who my partner has been before, how he has functioned and behaved in previous relationships, how it has informed the way he has changed and become what he is now. 

The point is to be able to have that open and transparent conversation with them without it hurting me or stunting the development of intimacy with this person. Not to just avoid the topic completely."

bookshelf,f1ivhvg,t1_f1gq7us,1569515413.0,Angela Carter is a master of the short story! Her language is decorative and violent and verbose and beautiful. I’m sure she and Woolf would have fascinating conversations.
bookshelf,f1iv92y,t1_f1hslvi,1569515338.0,"Wow, impressed you’ve read Swann’s Way! I’ve never been able to finish. Not out of a lack of interest, I’m really enthusiastic about Proust and all his contemporaries. But it’s dense. I know I’ll finish one day though. Maggie Nelson is a dreamboat, I think her work and Anne Carson’s really speak to each other sometimes. They’re both definitely pioneers of a fascinating blend of genre. Bluets is one of the best books I’ve ever read. Pick that one up when you can! 

You’ve got great taste - any recommendations for me?"
bookshelf,f1ith3q,t1_f1ilcpl,1569514767.0,"Ah really? It enhanced the experience for me. I love poetry so I always encounter form as an enriching tool, not a distraction. For me, chaos as it appears physically on the page reflects chaos as it appears in the narrative, all the white space surrounding the dissolving text was beautifully and curiously emblematic of bigger themes. It all enhanced the immersive nature of the reading experience at large for me. Not to mention the footnotes and interwoven narratives! I think it’s wonderful. But I can also understand how it would be too much."
bookshelf,f1golh2,t1_f1gh8fr,1569472572.0,"One of my favorites! So rich and enchanting and funny and inventive. I’m normally drawn to language driven literature versus narrative driven lit, but The Last Unicorn is just such classic and beautiful storytelling. can’t get enough of it."

Anne Carson is probably my favorite living writer. I think Plainwater is absolutely fantastic and perhaps one of her more accessible texts. Most people I’ve talked to have heard of or read Autobiography of Red but I don’t personally think that’s the best place to start with her...Float is fantastic and I love the loose chapbook form of it. Eros the Bittersweet was her dissertation and is more academically structured, but still a really gorgeous meditation on love, desire, language. So much of her work explores that. I’m a big big fan haha so I could keep going and going...I don’t think she’s written a single bad thing. You could blindly pick one from a stack and have made the perfect choice."

CasualConversation,eyttuhb,t1_eythqdw,1567445514.0,"I agree. I think it’s really important not to suppress the bad feelings and instead acknowledge them, confront them. But enabling them feels less like staring a monster in the face and more like surrendering yourself to it (in a weirdly pleasurable masochistic way.) What’s also interesting about this is how so many contrasting emotions coexist. A paradox of sensation"
