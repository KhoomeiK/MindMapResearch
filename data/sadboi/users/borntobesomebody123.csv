BPD,fmct9vn,t3_fuf7tx,1585952401.0,"She definitely loved you. Probably very intesely so. I’ve been in her position before. She needs to heal from her abuse, and learn how to be healthy on her own, but might not be ready to yet.  Normal? Love with untreated mental illness/trauma isn’t normal but it still is love. 

It feels like time was wasted, I’m sure she has similar feelings.... but I’m sure there were good moments too. Not to discredit how fucking painful it must be though!! 

I say, It’s not a waste if you learn from it.. you stated you’ve recognized from this relationship that there is some stuff you need to work on too. Do that and you can grow from this. 

Heart break sucks, but let it suck... let yourself mourn it. It will pass. I hope both of you can heal from this."

BPD,fm4vji6,t3_ft2x64,1585761602.0,"You were groomed and taken advantage of and I’m so sorry that happened. I totally relate to the older men thing. 

When I was 19 and mentally unstable and outpatient at a mental hosptal, I hooked up with a 38 year old from Grindr. That was my first sexual experience. He quickly left after he got what he wanted and after I told him I didn’t want to go further sexually. I felt so used. I was 19 but was like emotionally a child because of BPD.

My next sexual experience was with a 33 year old when I was 20. I would meet up with him at 3am and be high, drunk or on pills half the time. He eventually sexually assaulted me my first month of college. And I later had my first anal sex experience with him after he had already tooken advantage of me a year prior when I was drunk/high and falling asleep. 

It fucking sucks. I’m sorry that happened to you. I wish I could take my experiences back. 

You deserve better. But so many people have experienced what you have. Especially in the lgbt community. You can move past this, I promise <3"

the thing about breaking down every week (or day) for months is so so relatable to me. That was basically high school for me and still now I’m afraid. I’m still trying to figure out who I am so I’m not of much help on that

but I can tell that you want to transition and it could really help. You are valid, girl.

hrt won’t change you, just make you more emotional and often more happy and comfortable in your skin. 

Wishing you the best of luck with everything :)

And a lot of people on here say this: focus more on the euphoria you get from being authentic and less on the doubts cause those thoughts will eat you up. <3"

I don’t have many friends, maybe one or two but they’re from high school and the connection is kinda superficial. One of them ended up having BPD too. You don’t have to tell them you have BPD, unless you want to! just being open about your emotions is important though. <3"
BPD,fli5rv0,t3_fozsvx,1585175863.0,"I remember stealing peoples Club Penguin password in my neighbourhood and getting their accounts permanently banned, ditching school in 6th grade, hanging out with kids who smoked cigarettes in elementary school, trying to buy roofies in 6th grade so I could drug myself to sleep and miss school, throwing toy beach balls at cars, stealing from the convenience store, popping the tires on my own bike, trashing my own basement on New Years Eve, stabbing this girl in the stomach with a sharp pencil (in response to her stabbing me in the eye with a sharp pencil, what a mess..), being fascinated by drugs as a kid. I would purposely talk shit about people because I wanted to ruin my own reputation and destroy my life at school. 

Yes!! This is more me acting out than BPD lmaooo but yes. I would scream and cry every night and couldnt sleep. I would be obsessively checking when my best friend would come home. I would want to hook up with bad boys like Eminem, 50 cent, etc as an 8 year old. I couldn’t sit still in my own skin. I was dependent on my friends because I didn’t feel safe opening up to my parents about how horrible I felt."
