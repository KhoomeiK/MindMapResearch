MaddenUltimateTeam,fqvy4ab,t1_fqvk5d2,1589687852.0,"It happens in all sports, no matter how much strategy you put in, you can get bested by someone who just keeps abusing a stupid tactic. But In madden, it’s boosted by so much, having dumb tactics work way better than well thought out tactics most of the time.

In (English) football, there’s a boring style of gameplay that loads of the lower skilled teams use. They just drop back, have almost every single player behind the ball, and just defend. It’s really hard to breakdown because of the sheer numbers. Then they just attack once the other team has commuted more players forward. It’s a cheesy strategy but it works, and it gets the job done so I don’t blame them for doing it. More often that not though, the better teams still win."

SuicideWatch,fqo4pzk,t1_fqfaw89,1589507519.0,"Sorry again, I completely missed that you replied, I thought you just left it there. Thank you for replying and keeping up the conversation.

I listen to a lot of hip hop trap sort of stuff, but like the more chilled side of those genres. People like lil peep. A lot of it’s quite emotional, but I also like the side where it’s more jazzy a lot, like Mac Miller in his latest few albums.

Yeah, I’ve heard of intrusive thoughts, it’s one of the main things I struggle with, and I know I shouldn’t listen, but I can’t ignore them, it’s so hard for me, especially at the moment.

I just feel like although I’m trying to be a good person, which should make me one, I’m falling short and hurting others in the process. Like my friends. It’s hard for me to stay friends and help them when I’m struggling like this, and I am just a burden. No matter how hard I try, I usually end up doing more bad than good, especially when I’m going through a dark time, and that just feeds more into the negative loop.

Yeah the system is the healthcare system. Over in the uk, it’s all connected together, so it is a system working together, which sounds like a good idea. But it ends up not being that good. We can’t afford private health care so I get all of my care through the NHS, which is free, but often doesn’t perform a good enough job. The side that deals with young people with mental health problems and learning disabilities is called cahms. I’ve been under them for 3 years, and feel like I haven’t made any progress. You have a key worker assigned to you, who is supposed to see you a couple times a month, but can change depending on what you need. I haven’t had one for half of the time I’ve been with them. 

The key worker is supposed to direct you to people you need to see, like therapists, or specialists that help you get diagnosed, or people that can sort out medication. I’ve fought to get diagnosed for all of my problems, that after 2 and a half years, finally got it and the support needed, even though I needed it 2 and a half years ago. They’ve put me on medication, but don’t check back up on me about it often enough, so they don’t know how it’s affecting me. They have also failed me in the therapy side. I really want therapy to go well, but none of the therapist that have been assigned to me are suited to me, I do not feel comfortable with them, and I don’t feel like it can work, which obviously isn’t good. I tell them this, but they don’t have anybody to spare for me, as they’re so busy. So I get stuck with someone I don’t like for a few months, and get no progress at all. And I can’t go else where because private therapy for young people is next to non existent here. So I’m stuck with it. I feel let down by the one thing that should be helping me out.

They also always seem to focus on the wrong things, I have been diagnosed with autism, adhd, depression, and general anxiety. They always seem to focus most on the autism, which I’ve dealt with and doesn’t affect me in day to day life as much as the other things I suffer with. I tell them this regularly, but they see one path to me being healthy, and it’s just making it worse in the meantime and putting my life at risk, because it is less work for them.

Thank you, it feels good that you’re choosing to talk to me, I feel like a burden on most people, so I tend to just avoid people to save them the hassle.

I just feel like I’ve spent way to long not being better than that, I’ve spent way too long constantly having struggles, and it weighs in my family and friends around me, because I can’t be normal, and they always have to make sacrifices for me, and struggle just to help me sometimes, and I don’t want to be like that, I don’t want others to suffer because of me."

I don’t mind reiterating it to people at all. It’s just extremely frustrating how they handle it. It’s their job to try and help me get better and feel better In whichever ways they can, or at least help me cope with it and not make it worse. But every time they ask me to open up in an environment like that, especially considering I have autism and it’s a struggle being there anyway. I don’t mind open up over the internet as I’m in a familiar comfortable place and the anonymity helps a lot as well.

In the film, somebody took their life, and just seeing the reactions made me feel like I wanted someone to care about me like that, or that it would be nice if people felt hurt about me. And that kinda sent me into a spiral. I try desperately to be a nice person, but Im not all of the time, and that impacts me. I don’t want other people to hurt, so it took me into like a loop. I wanted to kill myself cause I didn’t feel cared about, and that others would miss me, to, that makes me a bad person thinking about wishing pain on others just for me, and that made me feel shit and like I should be gone, and it just went round and round.

I just feel so let down by the system, i feel like it’s only made me worse. And others just aren’t trained to be capable of making me better or looking after me like I’m a patient. I don’t blame others, or those close to me, they aren’t supposed to be able to deal with my shit, me and my friends are still teenagers, most people  at 16 don’t even have the maturity to even look after themselves. I can’t rely on them to make me better. It’s not fair. My family try their best to help, but they didn’t sign up for this when they had a kid, they’re busy doing stuff that they should be able to do most of the time. I just need that support from the system, and it isn’t there, and it just ends up as resentment towards the people close to me.

I know it’s human, but it still makes me feel bad that I have those feelings, and I feel like I should be better than that, and I’m stupid for not being able to be better

The amount of times I had to explain even the simplest things, like what actually happened, how it lead up to that. How I am mentally. Everything, and so I have to explain everything about me and open up constantly and it only made it worse at the time.

I was watching a film at the time, and it just made me realise that I’d want people to hurt, I want people to care about me. I want people to know that I really wasn’t ok, and that I wasn’t dramatising it, and they’ll feel guilty for not being there, idk, it makes me a bad person.
