depression,eyv41ry,t1_eyuserl,1567480022.0,"This. But I’ve noticed working out doesn’t do as much as it used to, that high will only last for a little bit in the day now"
Anxiety,eyu2ogi,t1_eytw4xf,1567451481.0,"Yeah I feel it has something to do with anxiety but like you said it’s confusing, how I am supposed to know what’s real and not. My friends were like “yeah that’s how it is you just keep going till it doesn’t happen anymore” in my head I was like that sounds draining and sad. But thank you for talking! And yeah st least were not alone on this"
Anxiety,eytvlp0,t1_eytpeco,1567446699.0,"That’s true, it’s just a scary feeling and I don’t want to make a mistake if it’s me being anxious/depressed"
Anxiety,eytuetj,t1_eyttw91,1567445906.0,"I have no trust issues in this relationship like everything’s going really good which is why I’m so lost and scared as to why I’m all of a sudden getting this feeling. And I don’t have a bad relationship with my mom at all. Anxiety and depression runs in my family both sides and I’ve been given that unlucky trait so idk what’s real and what’s my mental state acting up. And by grass is greener you mean like the next person is gonna be better, I’m more like I’ll feel better being single but st the same time that scares me"
Anxiety,eytsfgp,t1_eytr6ep,1567444526.0,"Literally where im at, it’s scary dude. Idk what to do it happened with the last relationship but. A lot sooner but I let it drag for almost 3 years. But this times different this girl never did anything wrong and is awesome to me. I can’t say anything cus I really fear seeing her heart broken and down bad. Idk what to do it and it sucks but just randomly out of no where the feeling started to come up and I was like damn not again 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️"
Anxiety,eyto9cs,t1_eyto2o6,1567441621.0,"Right I understand that, I just know it’ll wreck things if I bring it up."
Anxiety,eytn0o1,t1_eytmc19,1567440730.0,"See we always said we thought breaks were dumb and never wanted to do one for whatever reason. So I feel if I do that it’ll ruin things no matter what happens, I’m just real scared and don’t know what to do, I’ve been pondering seeing someone about my anxiety issue to see if maybe it really is anxiety, but I’m not sure how much medicine would help."
Anxiety,eytmusl,t1_eytmdw2,1567440616.0,"Tbh with you I always use weed for fun, but recently it’s just been making this underlying problem a big problem in my head. Now I don’t know if this is weed bringing out true feelings OR if it’s causing my anxiety/depression to spazz out since I’ve been sort of a mental mess since moving into school and an hour away"

socialanxiety,eyrdi6o,t3_cy7m4r,1567365829.0,You can switch “here” with whatever introduction you gotta do for yourself during the first day icebreaker 😂
relationship_advice,eyqubvz,t3_cy7neo,1567353765.0,"Defiantly not overdramatic, that would be maybe losing your shit and freaking out the second you heard her say that, but even then it’s warranted considering the way she’s talking about you. I’d confront her because if your your not her first choice, then you shouldn’t be putting your time and heart into a relationship where your not number 1 and just a “backup”"
depression,eypiw3g,t1_eypeznv,1567301395.0,"“Not your responsibility” but op also is obviously connected to this person, he can’t just get up and leave or else he would of done that and never posted this"

depression,eymat7x,t3_cxnela,1567203929.0,"The feeling when everyone goes home tho is the worst, I’ll be having a good time with anything then go back to being down once it’s over"
depression,eym4cyt,t1_eym448o,1567199163.0,"Thanks for responding, I’ve been denying seeing someone for a while now but I just can’t get over that side effect, plus I get ocd really bad and feel I’ll just obsess over whether or not I’ll be able to have sex when the time comes. I just feel like I’ll fix one problem
And get two more, ed and a bad case of ocd like I’ve never had before"
depression,eyf5atg,t3_cwsxms,1567043645.0,"I seem to have a guilty complex for some reason that makes me depressed and feel bad for ever enjoying myself or doing something fun, it’s pretty weird and I hate it"
relationship_advice,ey7d8d3,t1_ey7acak,1566879001.0,"True I agree with you. That sounds spot on to what happens to me, but it’s only with negative feelings. I’m thinking the anxiety from school and moving in could be a cause as well"
socialanxiety,ey6ndtc,t3_cvs3pw,1566859649.0,I’m feeling the same way with my fitness account... part of it I’m bored and the other half a little embarrassed by it
