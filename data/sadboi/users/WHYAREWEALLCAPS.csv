A good IC courier only takes deliveries that will be profitable. That means big tips and/or kickbacks from the service. Small personal orders like yours are, in the grand scheme of things, a negative drain on the IC's cashflow. So any decent IC courier knows to ignore/refuse orders like yours. Generally only new people who don't know better will take that sort of order, but they'll either wise up fast or quit. Want it faster next time? But a giant ass tip in there. Like $5-$10 above 20%-25%. You'll get it in less than hour.

People seem to think these services assign a single IC to pick your order up. Nope, they throw it out in a queue for ICs to take. ICs have to work the system that is trying to fuck them constantly because all these companies, ever single one, is hemorrhaging cash like a sailor on leave. Uber, the biggest of them, lost $8.5 billion last year. UberEats is their most profitable division, but only because it loses less than their main business. The pandemic has been a shot in the arm for these companies, but they're already on life support. This is just going to prolong the inevitable about what is coming - a giant die off of these companies."

They increased only during the Great Depression, but they did not ""skyrocket"". The Great Depression saw a rise of less than 2% of the suicide rate. And. in fact, during other recessions and depressions mortality rates decreased.

>For most age groups, mortality tended to peak during years of strong economic expansion (such as 1923, 1926, 1929, and 1936–1937). In contrast, the recessions of 1921, 1930–1933, and 1938 coincided with declines in mortality and gains in life expectancy. The only exception was suicide mortality which increased during the Great Depression, but accounted for less than 2% of deaths. Correlation and regression analyses confirmed a significant negative effect of economic expansions on health gains. **The evolution of population health during the years 1920–1940 confirms the counterintuitive hypothesis that, as in other historical periods and market economies, population health tends to evolve better during recessions than in expansions.**

Instead of using missiles and other such intelligently guided projectile, it's always about the pew-pew-pew. B5 was guilty of it, as well, but at least they adapted it to the medium instead of just transplating them wholesale."
Whatcouldgowrong,fpah10m,t1_fpadbrt,1588447998.0,Get some old school historical re-enactment in there. Fun for the whole family!

Force us to live under the tyrrany of decent social programs that protect our citizenry. We would be in such agony. How could we ever withstand poor people who have easy access to things that are necessities?"
AskReddit,fpa23mx,t1_fp9s783,1588439255.0,Nah. That's because they're well aware people are buying their product to empty out and roll blunts.

sciencefiction,fp909fa,t1_fp60bjt,1588409370.0,"Which is nonsense that is anthropomorphizing AI. A sentient machine is going to be our first contact with an alien species. It's experience will be completely outside of what we as humans experience. Modern scifi likes to paint AI as the bad guys because for a long time scifi had a habit of filing the serial numbers off and giving a fresh coat of paint to some racial stereotype and making that the enemy. Except now those races have a way to raise a big stink about it. Also, bear in mind the recent wave of anti-intellectualism that's going on. It is no coincidence that you're seeing things that would be considered the pinnacle of intellectual thought being the bad guys."
sciencefiction,fp8zx2c,t1_fp7wqd1,1588409002.0,"> When people claim that facial recognition software has a racial bias, it makes one fear that AI might be too discriminate. 

We can't even make automated hand sanitizer and soap dispensers that don't have a racial bias(I shit you not).
