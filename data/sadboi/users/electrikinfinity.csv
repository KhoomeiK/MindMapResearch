They are punishing the customer for their mistake. They are a billion dollar company there's no reason for this to have happened. As much as it would be great if we lived in a perfect world where everything was fair and everyone lived up to the highest morals, we realistically don't. A company of this calibur understands that. And to cut off the link completely and punish the people who actually were using it truthfully is terrible customer service. It wasn't just the people on this sub also, this link was being shared on instagram, twitter, youtube and also by word of mouth. My sister actually got this code and redeemed it multiple times from her coworker who figured it out."
lululemon,fr4zpk7,t1_fr4xn1t,1589899897.0,It wasn't exactly a leaked coupon. Lulu produced a lazy universal link that could be redeemed by anyone however many times they decided they wanted to. So people shared the link on different social media platforms and people abused the link.
lululemon,fr4wmgi,t1_fr4v33r,1589898268.0,"You're pretty off point with this. If you have any knowledge of programming and web development, this is an extremely easy thing to do, to create one time codes for people. There's always going to be people using exploits whether its moral or not. If they didn't want everyone using a code, they needed to not do the lazy thing and send out a universal code that could be redeemed infinitely. And to then punish people who completed the challenge by completely negating the code when it was a mistake on their end. Personally, i used the code i was sent in my email and i used it once even though i very quickly realized i could click the link sent to me and just make a new account and use it repeatedly because it linked to the same page no matter what. But not everyone is going to do that."

I think it's kind of crappy to cancel everyones discount because of errors they made on their end.

I've been on both ends of this before. I know for myself personally i want a person to be able to be my friend first and foremost and if they can't do that without commitment, in my mind they won't work for me in a committed relationship. I was actually just recently in this situation with an infj who i was attracted to and genuinely liked, but he drove me nuts when we'd spend too much time together and knew it wouldn't work for me. I was consistently telling him i didn't want a long term relationship, if you wanna hang out and hook up thats cool but thats it, or if he wanted to just be friends thats cool with me too. I was very straightforward but he kept pushing and finally i just ended the situation because i realized it wasn't healthy. I was wrong to even make the relationship physical but i gave when he pushed for it, i really liked having him in my life and as a friend. He bolted and said he couldn't be around me if we weren't going to actually commit so i guess that was that. 

If you're not comfortable with the situation there's plenty of other people out there that will give you what you want. Just be blunt with him about what you want and what you don't and if he's not willing, move on it's probably not the right match. I spent a good year on a guy in my 20s who clearly just wanted to be friends and fool around and i wanted more, i actually turned down a couple really great people during that time waiting for this guy when it was never going to happen."

I was lucky to be introduced to mbti by a psychologist but most people find it through 16 personalities which doesnt even mention the functions. I think its easier for the majority if people to label people as sterotypes. But its so much deeper than that. The theory is so much more complex than just slapping a sterotype on someone. I find it really interesting to learn about how the functions interact with each other and i love analyzing people, i absolutely love psychology. Humans are so complex its so interesting. 

As for the fetishizing, i kind of noticed that but wasn't sure if it was just me thinking that because entp is my type. I have noticed that people do that to both entp and also intp, and most of the time its coming from Fi users. Ive helped typed several people who are very blatant Fi users insisting they are Ti. Or people straight out asking how to become more like Intp/entp. Its very strange, i think all of the types have their strengths and weaknesses. And what does it matter what type you fall into anyways, its not a competition of this type is better than that type. No one cares what cogitive type you are. All mbti really is is a way to analyze yourself/others and to understand how the world is percieved by the individual. For me, its helped me to see areas of my lufe i need to work on, as i struggle a lot with my sensing abilities. It has also helped me understand how the people around me are perceiving the world, which in turn has made it easier to communcate with and knkw what those people need from me."

Mature entps are pretty genuinely empathetic people because of Fe. We like to make others around us feel good about themselves. We just don't deal with our own emotions very well. We can come off insensitive because of our Ti function which seeks truth so we will be very blunt about things, especially to the people around us who we are trying to help.

insomnia,fpxuifl,t3_gg5t28,1588989840.0,"Ive been on a mix of ativan and a bunch of other meds for many years for sleep. I was taking seroquel at one point with it but the seroquel was horrible for me. But with ativan it can be a slippery slope. I started with .5 mg and am up to 4 now and does nothing for me anymore but take away withdrawal effects. My insomnia gets severe again if i try and taper at all so im kind of stuck. The benzos will also mess with your sleep cycle so they aren't great to be taking for sleep, but if you have severe insomnia and have tried everything else you may not have much of a choice. I went many years without sleeping and finally found a combo that helped me sleep, but i dont really get quality sleep because of the gaba drugs. Its very surface level sleep if that makes sense. But i can function better than the years i went with a couple hours a night. 

 Those drugs both work on different receptors so its not the case of its bad to mix them. Its more the case of, get off the ativan if its possible to now before you can't. Some people dont have much of a problem getting off benzos, but others it can be severely damaging with the chance of never coming off them.

I think you need to decide what is right for you, mbti doesn't determine your likes and dislikes, it can certainly influence it, but its not absolute. Cognitive function will determine more how you approach, perceive, and process a subject than if you will enjoy it. 

But for my own experince, when i am well enough to start working and possibly back to college, though im starting to feel too old to, i would go back and study chem engineering."
entp,fprtc6o,t1_fpqjdll,1588861644.0,I actually find this to work well with both my esfp and enfp friend when they are panicking. I usually try to solve peoples problems by breaking down whats going on and why they are feeling they way they do but it tends to come off as harsh and puts them into an even deeper existential crisis. My esfp friend has straight out told me she just wants some validation and empathy and not to be completely psychologically analyzed. I think this has to do with Fi being secondary function of both esfp and enfp.
INTP,fprrx2f,t1_fprpnlu,1588860848.0,Wtf? Thats absolutely horrible advice to give a 17 year old girl who has been hospitalized for anorexia. Op please do not listen to this advice. Speak to a professional.

lululemon,fprie0g,t3_gf01oe,1588854922.0,I have similar measurements/height to you and was having issues with the WT feeling tight in the legs and also was digging into my waist a bit when doing high intensity workouts. Im usually a size 6 in everything but  I sized up to an 8 in the WT and it felt a lot better.
MbtiTypeMe,fprcw9z,t1_fpr328f,1588850524.0,"Have you read carl jungs psychological types? I would highly suggest it if you havent. That and the mbti books by isabel briggs-myers gave me a clearer understanding of the cogitive functions pertaining to mbti theory. I think you are confusing Fi and Ti, which is really easy to do. If you have Fi with auxilliary function Ne it can feel as though you are using logic, but thats not technically what the thinking function is in mbti. If you're main concern is trying to get to find your root self, self discover, in the sense of relating experiences to their current self, that is FiNe. It can be very confusing, a lot of people mistype to intp because of it. Its tough because both types will be similar because of Ne auxiliary, so looking at the relationship of each function, and how to react to each other will cement the understanding of the types. Ne is a very curious and sometimes dizzying function, with ideas and concepts bouncing around our heads constantly. 

I went through the same thing years ago as im an NeTi user, very close to intp, and was confused whether or not i could have been, enfp which are NeFi users. Part of the discerning factors, and because you are older and your tertiary and inferior functions will be developed/developing, you can look to those functions also to discern type. For me i am a very strong Fe user, i have little to no use of Fi. Same would go for an intp, a prefernce of Fe over Fi. So studying Fe and also Te should be helpful for you. 

Obviously you know yourself the best out of anyone so take what i say with a grain of salt, but from analyzing the information you have given in both this questionaire and your videos, you seem to speak with Fi quite a bit. That is the intps downfall, it is their demon function. Ti is more of an objective function than subjective. TiNe seeks truth within concepts they generate about the world. Not so much concerned with where they stand and how they fit into life, or their life path because of demon Fi. 

Again, id highly suggest grabbing a copy of those books, you seem really interested in the functions and that is the root of mbti theory.  Good luck!

Edit: also you can look into ennagram if you havent already. Nkt always, but Intps usually fall under 5 or 6, infp usually fall under 4. Sometimes that can help people as it measures behavioral tendency not just cognitive function."
books,fpq4db6,t3_ges8jp,1588814923.0,"I used to enjoy reading quite a lot more before the internet than i do now. I feel like i used to go to a bookstore and just browse and pick out books that looked interesting, or chat with the people there about recommendations. Then would just read and enjoy them..or not enjoy them. I didn't feel the pressure to be finishing X amount of books in a certain time frame, or to only buy a certain genre or 5 star reviewed books."
