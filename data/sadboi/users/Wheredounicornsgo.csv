Those dates sound good for a visit (if they do) and maybe we can all have breakfast together the day of. You’re welcome to come with me, but I won’t be home for the rest of the day and/or night,” (whichever applies, or both if both apply). Spoiler alert, she will not want to come with you. True narcissists want their target without support. Then you could follow it up with something like “then we could spend some time together the next day”. Or the day before.

datingoverthirty,fffc7h4,t3_et9dtz,1579880754.0,"Ask him, seriously. Don’t be vague, it’s the only way to really find out.

My personal approach is that if the other person isn’t excited to see me or wanting to plan something at all in the beginning, they’re just not that into me. I’ve been “blindsided” by people too much in the past because I ignored little things like this. I’m a friends first kind of person, and I definitely don’t mind making all the plans with a friend. A romantic prospect, though? Nah. If the level of interest doesn’t match, it will most likely not work out. 

On the other end of things, I’ve had people assume and react without even clarifying things with me or asking where I stood. In those situations, I’m actually grateful for the behavior because it shows a massive lack of maturity when communicating. So it wouldn’t have worked out anyway. Basically, don’t heavily trust what a new person says. Ive found that many people get excited or infatuated quickly and then lose it easily. Not everyone is compatible with everyone else. Having no expectations with any specific person until you really know them is what I’d recommend."

JUSTNOMIL,fdf7c0k,t3_el2igq,1578354986.0,"It honestly sounds like she did you a favor. Continuing to tolerate and justify her poor behavior and favoritism only sets the example for your kids that it’s okay and that they just have to take it because they’re related. The thing is, being related to someone doesn’t give them an inherent privilege to treat people like second class citizens. It’s also extremely unusual for a parent to rely emotionally on their child to the extent you described. 

She needs one or more friends her age or a therapist if she has that many issues that she can’t spend any time on the phone with your kids. This is a problem with her, yes. In a way though, it’s also a problem with how you’ve normalized these behaviors. I know it’s difficult to go through or see clearly when you’re in it, but I think some therapy for you might not be out of order.  At the very least you are a person worthy of respect as a fellow human being. How does your kids’ father feel about all of this? Has he said anything to you?"
datingoverthirty,fdcv02b,t1_fdcryka,1578285085.0,"Yeah, I started bringing things up when I noticed his actions were starting to not match his words. That’s a big thing for me.

I’ve just reached a point where I’m aware I don’t need to stay in that situation. 

It was unfortunate at the time because it seemed we matched so well, but the bottom line is with the way he was acting, it couldn’t have lasted. I can only control myself. 🤷‍♀️ I hope you move on and heal from this soon. I try to look at mine as a test of what I’ve learned and how I’ve grown and matured.

I will admit I’d hoped we could still work things out somehow. The last time we spoke made it very clear he does not live in reality. I first thought maybe NPD (though obviously Im not qualified to make any diagnosis), but this fits somewhat too. That’s the tough part, it’s like a switch flips and you don’t know why. 

Except with my situation, I mostly only saw the guy during the week. Long story, but he drove down almost every weekend to help out his mom (there’s more to unpack there, which unfortunately I didn’t find out until much later into things). Also, we got together in late Sept. and broke up the first week in Dec. Anyway, I sympathize with you. It’s really tough.

datingoverthirty,fcuxe64,t3_ej15lz,1577990444.0,"The question to ask yourself is how important is it for a partner to share those interests? Do they have to share all of them, or are there just a few that are most important? For example, I’m an avid hiker. To the extent that I get very antsy and pretty down in the dumps if I go more than a week without a nice, long hike or walk outdoors (5+miles at least). Realistically it wouldn’t be possible for me to pursue a relationship with someone who doesn’t like to hike at all. 

I’m a massive nature nut and I love to camp and fish as well, so we would clash in those areas as well more than likely. Plus with small kids, going back to school and other life obligations there just wouldn’t be a lot of extra time left. There are other interests that aren’t as important to share, but would be nice. Personally,  for the most part as long as I have at least one good friend to share my interests I don’t HAVE to have a partner that does."

However, if the child refuses all liquids then they need to be taken to the hospital for an IV. Basically, you’re saying the same thing I did, just a different way."

datingoverthirty,fc0y3uo,t3_efi9nm,1577302817.0,"So, I’m on the other end of things sort of. I’m separated but not yet divorced. I’ve had years to grieve and process my feelings. We are cooperative co-parents and amicably sat down and worked out a plan. We filled out and filed the papers together. It’s a shame it couldn’t work out, but I certainly don’t want to go out and sow my wild oats, so to speak. There’s nothing wrong with that, but I’ve spent many months finding myself. I know who I am and what I want from life. However, because of situations like this I’ve decided to adopt a friends first approach, then letting something develop slowly if it’s there. That doesn’t work for everyone, I’d venture to even say most people in modern dating. That’s okay, I know what I’m looking for and I know where my boundaries are. 

It also helps cut down on the surprises people bring out in month 2-3 (massive issues, etc.) 
People make a lot of assumptions about others, but there’s no specific formula that fits everyone. If I meet someone I have a connection with who is compatible, stable and mature and at least okay at communicating, I can’t imagine wondering what/who else is out there. Different people process things in different ways, but in this case I would just respect her decision. You can stay in contact if you can truly be platonic, or let her know she’s free to contact you if her situation changes and move forward with life."

I’m sure he was used to having his way with women, but he couldn’t have been less appealing. Different people have different qualities that light their fire. For me personally, I’d rather be with a less conventionally attractive person that *I’m* very into because they’re a great fit for me than to have a more conventionally attractive person that doesn’t suit me as well. I truly don’t understand the height thing. Just be at least as tall as me (5’6”) and we’re good."

This from a self-proclaimed empath. 

I’m going to echo a previous poster’s recommendation to read up on narcissism. We aren’t clinically trained, but even anyone expressing multiple signs of the disorder should be avoided. Mine tried the push and pull thing as well. I did speak to him a little about 2 weeks after the breakup, but then it quickly became apparent he was extremely unstable.

I tried having a conversation and asking him to communicate what was going on so we could discuss how to proceed. He has anxiety issues and has an extremely emotionally abusive mom that raised him to believe he had to take care of her. Basically, he’d assumed a co-dependent fixer role for her. I knew something was going on, but after a couple weeks of wild mood swings and treading into the emotionally abusive territory (name-calling, “you made me...” statements), I had to end things. I communicated that while I understood if he was having a tough time elsewhere in his life, his behavior had become unacceptable.

I told him I would be open to honest, self aware  discussion in the near future, but that I would not hold out hope and would move forward with my life. In response, I got a rambling message that made it obvious to me that he has severe emotional and mental issues. He had cherry picked things I’d told him about me and my life and twisted details around. He told me I was “the one” but that the timing was off. I think we all know what that means. I had a hunch and came across his Tinder profile a short time later. So yeah, massive bullet dodged there. Thank goodness for taking things slowly!

Other than having poor boundaries (which is an issue I struggle with too), there was nothing about you that you could have changed to make this any easier. Someone having poor boundaries is no excuse for another person to treat them the way he treated you, though. 

Too often people treat others as disposable instead of actual living, breathing beings. He could have been honest and (even gently) level with you, but chose the easiest route for himself. This is hard right now, but believe me when I say when something real comes along, you’ll appreciate this experience even more. Don’t be afraid to take a nice, long break from dating.

dating,f71pqzp,t1_f6o3gg1,1573345400.0,"This all the way. I’m totally fine if someone decides early on they don’t want a relationship with me/at all (whatever the case may be). However, if that changes at any point then they need to speak up. I’m not a mind reader, and I certainly wouldn’t throw myself at someone whose last communication about an “us” was that it’s not going to happen. So as a healthy, functional person my next step would be getting back out there and meeting new people.

I’ve had it happen twice in my life, both times I moved on and met someone else. In fact, in both cases it happened fairly early on and made me realize that yes, I truly was healed and ready for a relationship. The first time, I ended up being with the other guy I met for over 7 years (married for over 5). My current boyfriend and I haven’t been together for long (I’ve been separated since May), but things are great. If the most recent “not ready for a relationship” guy came back, it would definitely be too late. 

It’s not that I *have* to be in a relationship, it just has never taken me very long to find someone who is a good match. With each LTR, I learn and grow and each one lasts much longer because I’ve not only improved myself, but discovered more about what I need and want in a partner and what to look out for."
GYOWA,f6fqln2,t1_f6dxuzi,1572817069.0,"I’ve been to therapy, that’s actually what helped me realize she’s a toxic abuse enabling narcissist. I would never want a friend like that. There are huge limits on her contact with my children (with their father’s full agreement) because they don’t need to be exposed to her nasty side. If you want and like having your mom in your life, more power to you. You should recognize that isn’t a healthy option for everyone, though. I can move on and forgive for the past but also choose not to take on any further toxicity."
GYOWA,f6dteu4,t3_dqbx7e,1572796890.0,"I don’t wish death on her, but when my mom passes I’ll be relieved to be free of her toxicity. She abused me for most of my life, allowed/looked the other way while my stepfather abused me. Then turned the whole family against me with lies because of course she was supposed to be the most important person in my life and the only one I loved. Also, they had to have a reason to justify the abuse otherwise they might feel a teeny tiny bit guilty. 

By the time I got old enough to have a serious boyfriend, thankfully I realized her game and didn’t allow her to sabotage my relationships. Long story short, I caved to societal/family pressure and allowed her to be in my life enough that my kids know her. So we do see her once every 2-3 weeks for a few hours. For a long time, I felt guilty and sad that I wouldn’t mourn her death. Then I realized that simply giving birth to someone and keeping them alive doesn’t automatically entitle a person to devotion."
datingoverthirty,f5xycuu,t1_f5vemm0,1572548080.0,"It depends, in my case by the time we “officially” ended things, the marriage had been over for years. The whole “thought it would be best to stay together for the kids” thing. Thankfully, we realized that’s actually a terrible idea, not only as a bad example of how a healthy relationship should be, but also for us as individuals. So on paper, yes it was only ~4 mos. after officially separating that I got together with my current boyfriend. At that point though, my ex and I hadn’t had any physical contact whatsoever for years. It was over over, lol.

I don’t think the amount of time officially separated speaks to whether or not I’ve moved on from my ex. In reality, I had years to go through the grieving process and mourn the loss of the marriage and what I’d hoped it would be. Believe me, I was never willing to just be with anyone. Especially after things ended with my ex, getting involved with someone unsure about where and who they are, what they want or where they want to be in life was a giant no.  

It’s actually great because I’ve been through and over any negative feelings about the whole thing as well. So while we didn’t work as partners, I don’t think he’s a terrible person or wish him any ill will. I wish it would have worked out differently, but I also don’t pine for him. I’m taking things slowly with my new guy, but we’ve already had quite a few amazing conversations about where we are and what we want in life both now and in the future.

datingoverthirty,f5ffzwn,t3_dninrz,1572182091.0,"It’s not weird at all. That’s how I prefer things as well. I want to start by saying this is my opinion about my life only. I realize there are plenty of people who want sex right away, and that’s totally cool if both people are on the same page. I need time to trust someone though. For me, sex is very intimate and requires trust and at least some romantic connection and feelings (within a relationship, anyway). I’ve had a few FWBs in the past, but for some reason my brain treats it as a completely separate thing. So I will literally never develop romantic feelings. There still has to be trust, though. One I’d known and been friends with for 5 years, another for 3 years. With the only one I didn’t already know, we talked and hung out for a couple months before getting physical. 

Finding myself single for the 4th time in my adult life a few months back, I decided to forgo the whole FWB thing. Two out of the three I’ve had in my life got feelings and it ended badly even after discussing the weird way my brain works multiple times. Plus, I wanted something lasting and genuine based on something more than just physical. Sure, it eliminated a lot of people who matched/were interested, but honestly we likely wouldn’t have been compatible anyway. Especially if someone considers spending a couple months having fun and going out and laughing and having good conversations/light physical stuff with someone to be a waste without sex. Plus, too many people confuse lust/infatuation with love far too often, and taking things more slowly helps with that a lot. 

The man I’m with now feels the same way I do. He was nervous to bring it up because so many people want to attach a stigma or assume repression based on a simple request to take things at a pace that’s comfortable for everyone. That’s not to say we stay completely platonic, but there’s definitely a way of insuring needs are met and no one is frustrated while also escalating the physical aspect at a slow and steady pace. The biggest thing I learned from my most recent dating experiences are to never compromise your values and beliefs just to be with someone. Just be sure to clearly communicate your needs and interest so the lack of physical contact right away isn’t misinterpreted as a lack of interest or desire."

datingoverthirty,f4l2mx3,t3_dkwasj,1571661417.0,"So the whole ultimatum thing isn’t a good idea, ever. The vast majority of the time, it leads to someone lying to appease the person giving the ultimatum. Or actually going through with it, then resenting it later down the line which obviously leads to the end of the relationship. Honestly, if this is a dealbreaker for you, you should have just ended things. 

To be honest, I totally get where you’re coming from. I do have 2 “exes” on Facebook, one I “dated” online long distance when I was 15, and a guy I was with for less than 3 mos. 14 years ago before we realized we were better off staying friends. I haven’t talked to either of them in years. Other than that, I don’t keep in contact or hang out one on one with my exes out of respect for my current relationship. Not literally the guy I just started dating, but I was with my ex for over 7 years (married for over 5). So once we got serious, I did a phone/Facebook cleanup because that’s just how I feel it should be. I did do a phone contact clean up with anyone else I’d been talking to (none were on social media) after my current guy and I became exclusive though. He did not ask me to, I just wanted to out of respect because it’s what I would want. 

The one exception is my soon to be ex husband, we have 2 kids together so obviously we will be in contact. However, I would still never just go hang out with him without the kids or anyone else around. It just makes things less complicated over all. What if an ex has feelings and causes drama because they’ve gotten the wrong idea or something? Not worth it, I have plenty of friends. I don’t need to keep exes around to potentially muddy the waters. I’m pretty old fashioned I guess, but that seems super weird unless you’ve been friends with the person for life or something. 

That being said, I would never ask someone to drop a friend for me. Rather, I would bring it up early on and then break things off if they were in a situation like you describe. There’s no way that talking to an ex about a current relationship is good or healthy. You’ll find someone compatible with your preferences in that respect, it just might take a little time. Personally, it was really nice when the man I’m dating brought it up on his own that he felt that way when we were discussing past relationships (briefly) and what we’d learned from them."

Making the choice to lie rather than simply say it’s too soon to give details is a huge problem for me. If they’ll justify lying about that, what else will they justify lying about?

Not because of propriety or religion, but because that’s when I start to get truly comfortable enough with someone to break the physical barrier beyond a hug. I have to have some sort of an emotional connection to be able to take things to the next level. Flirting and initiating low pressure physical contact (ie. holding hands, putting your arm around her shoulder, etc.) is a great way to show interest while still staying in your comfort zone.

Matched on Bumble last Mon., started talking on the phone every night since Fri.  (average is about 1.5 hrs: shortest was 45 min., longest was 3 hrs.) Except when we met up Tues. because we talked in person. :) I had minor surgery yesterday, so we have plans again on Mon. and we’ll keep contact until then. 

I have a Halloween tradition where I like to try to watch one horror movie a night until Halloween night. He was the one to first suggest a “middle school movie date,” where we both watch the same movie and then call after. It was adorable, I’m thinking pretty soon the movie dates will be more in person (he mentioned inviting me over). It’s too soon for expectations, but so far so good (great, actually)!"

I’m definitely attracted to intelligence, but not to the extent that they seem pompous, if that makes any sense. I especially enjoy when they’re more knowledgeable on topics I’m not as informed in. That way we learn from/challenge each other sometimes. :)  I also want to add this was total coincidence, I wasn’t even aware a couple of them were until fairly far into dating.

datingoverthirty,f16hy9d,t3_d7xp8v,1569213159.0,"My dealbreakers:
-Being shitty, rude and/or excessively negative for no reason. I get that sometimes people go through hard times in life, but if that’s a part of their actual personality, it’s a problem.

-Poly, I know it’s really common now and I have absolutely no hate for the people who enjoy it. It just isn’t for me.

-Lying, it’s been the common denominator of the downfall of the 4 serious relationships I’ve had as an adult. I get that lots of people tell little white lies (ie. “That shirt looks great on you!”). I don’t love it, but if they stop once I express that it really bothers me, we’re good. More serious lies are an instant dealbreaker.

-Being a homebody. I love a good couch flop and Netflix binge session as much as anyone else, but I also really love to get out in nature and go to local events and do things like bowling, etc. It just won’t work with someone who very rarely or never wants to leave the house. 

-Smoking because I’m allergic and I have asthma.

-Severe untreated mental issues, abusive behaviors or any kind of permanent STD. 

As for my type, apparently computer science majors? Lol. I realized when I took some time for introspection and self improvement about a month and a half ago. Literally everyone I’ve ever been in love with has been a computer science major. They all vary widely in both physical appearance and personality, so that’s the only common denominator."

datingoverthirty,f0s4l02,t1_f0pz0kj,1568898743.0,"As a woman just entering the dating world after over 7 years, to me it feels like the world has turned upside down. I’m not one that jumps right into sex. For me, it’s a significant step and something I’d rather share with someone I really like and know fairly well and have a good chance of building something with. If a man wants to assume other things about me based on that belief, then I wouldn’t want to try to be in a relationship with him anyway. It’s exhausting trying to be with someone who jumps to conclusions and doesn’t even try to communicate or ask if they need clarification. 

I’m actually very HL, but I manage it by taking care of myself. I know that in the long run, having multiple partners and a string of short flings is not going to make me happy. I know most people don’t work that way and that’s totally fine. It’s also completely possible to break things off if two people are absolutely not sexually compatible. I don’t think taking a few months to get to know and get comfortable with someone is asking too much. If it is, then we are very likely looking for different things.

I get tons of matches, but very early on usually discover we have different goals in mind, or aren’t compatible in some other way. So when I do find someone I have great chemistry with and meet up with them to make sure it’s there in person, I focus only on that person until we either go our separate ways for whatever reason, or something develops. I’ve also grown and changed and done work on myself through the years, so I know exactly who I am and what I’m looking for. I don’t play games, I’m completely myself and I use the wisdom I’ve gained to guide me through the process. 

I understand most people move at least fairly quickly, but I’m old fashioned. Not because of religion or because I think I should or because I’m repressed. It’s because I’ve discovered it’s what feels right and is best for me/makes me happiest. The right person for me won’t have any issues with it (no one I’ve ever been serious with has)."
datingoverthirty,ezx9k5r,t3_d2w9g3,1568235138.0,"In my case, that’s not at all what it means. It genuinely takes me at least 2-3 weeks before I even begin to feel the person out and possibly  get feelings, and for me that’s extremely fast. It’s only happened a few times in my life, and always when we talked constantly and/or saw each other often. Typically, it takes me a couple months. Once there’s something there, I stop talking to/meeting new people and focus my attention on that person to see how it goes. If nothing else comes of it, that’s okay. Back to talking to/meeting new people. I’ve discovered this view isn’t common, though. People think I’m not interested no matter how many times I explain I’m like this, I always have been and I always will be."
datingoverthirty,ezwofyt,t3_d2an82,1568221349.0,"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. You’re not stupid of course, but this just seems silly. If you had been in almost constant contact and he backed off, then maybe back off a bit to match in case he’s freaked out, but definitely eventually still ask him why. You haven’t been from what you’ve said, though. So why is it a big deal to text him? 

Who cares who initiates conversation? I mean, if you find that 2-3 months in (if you keep seeing each other) that you’re still having to initiate, then that’s worth bringing up to him. If you like this guy and want to see him, then ask him out or mention going out together. Otherwise you’re gonna miss out because most men know when you’re playing games. Make no mistake, whether you see it as or not, staying silent because you don’t want to be the first to text is a game."

datingoverthirty,ezpz0d9,t3_d1lith,1568051743.0,"I legitimately don’t understand POVs like this. I’m 34 and I just signed up for a legit dating site (CMB) a few days ago. I signed up for Tinder too, but only because it’s one I haven’t tried and I’ve heard finding a relationship from there is possible. I made a very brief foray into OKC and PoF a few months back for about a month, but because I didn’t have my real name up and didn’t have great pics, I think it gave off a vibe that attracted shadier people. So I took a break and focused on myself and really thought about what I wanted and where I was mentally and emotionally.

Other than initially creating my profile and putting up pics, I’ve put very little effort into looking/matching anywhere. Yet I still have dozens of matches, already met up with one person to hike today and I’m talking to a couple others that are quite promising. Other than large physical limitations, I have a hard time understanding this view point. I don’t mean to invalidate your feelings and experience. I just actually don’t understand at all. 

What does teaching men to be men even mean? Even if it didn’t work out, every man I’ve met through OLD has definitely been male..."

For me personally, it won’t work if the guy doesn’t want or like to text and/or talk on the phone a lot between dates. I’m okay with not matching with as many people because the connection and chemistry with those I do match with becomes very strong and the resulting relationship (if one develops) ends up being very fulfilling. For me it’s a solid foundation. Being at work is one thing, because of course many people can’t be on their phone at all then. I also understand less frequent messaging when out with friends, etc. I’m an often/constant texter and I also enjoy talking on the phone whenever possible. Not everyone is and that’s fine, we just won’t work out as romantic partners. The one exception is if we’re able to meet very frequently in person, however since I have small kids I don’t see that happening any time soon."

If it was real on his side too, I’d think he would’ve made different choices. So I’m making it a point to continue getting used to going out by myself (history of long-term relationships). I’m going to a play Friday night and checking Meetup regularly for other events that interest me. I’ve also started writing in a journal again. That way I can check in with myself and make sure I have the right outlook on things and keep myself pointed in the right direction.

As soon as I enforced healthy boundaries (ie. If you can’t take a few seconds to communicate when we’ve already discussed it, then maybe it’s time to take some steps back.), suddenly he’s “not ready for a relationship” and “needs therapy before he can date.” It could be true, I’m not psychic.

   However, since he said all this right after meeting with his ex, I’d say chances are good he’s either back with her or has decided he just wants to sleep around and decided that honesty wasn’t the best policy.  I don’t ask for a lot, but I would certainly expect someone to contact me sooner than 2 1/2 hrs. before a date to cancel, especially after saying they would talk to me in the morning the night before. It’s so incredibly frustrating, at this point I’m just hoping to meet someone out in the wild at a Meetup event or something."

There were others issues aside from the DB (actually, they created the DB in the first place). I’ve since joined a dating site, not for anything really serious right away, but just to meet and talk to people. If I end up falling for someone eventually, that’s great. I’ll have a FWB/AP in the meantime. :)  Actually, the AP hiccup I had a while back is what made me realize sneaking around just isn’t me. The biggest thing is that because he racked up so much debt in the first couple years of our marriage, our living situation can’t change anytime soon (1-2 more years). 

Honestly though, for the sake of our little kids I’d rather have a duplex type situation. Where we could have our own house with separate access, but still both see the kids whenever we want to. Since seeing me openly talking to other people, he’s been saying he wants to “win me back.” No, thank you. I sat around for 4 1/2 years waiting for a change. Thousands of dollars spent on marriage counseling that went nowhere. Finally I’m taking some time for myself to get fit and explore my hobbies and interests.

A few weeks ago, I thought I’d found a good one. We met up once, but just as a get to know you (nothing happened). We made plans to meet up again in a few days. 

We had discussed at some point going to a place near me that interested us both. He went there the night after we met up (he said to take his son). After that, it was like he was discouraging me from going there. So I decided to join some local groups on Meetup and go with them. Keep in mind, at this point he’s 100% aware I’ve lived in this area nearly my entire life.  He does not live in the same area. He’s also aware that I’m committed to fitness and getting more in shape.

I found a group I really liked and decided to check out their upcoming and past events. I was glad when I saw they went to the place I had discussed with pAP weekly. I decided to check out the people that showed up to their last event to see if most were around my age and make sure they weren’t all iron man competitors I’d never keep up with, lol. 

Surprise, surprise, there’s pAP. Now, that wouldn’t be a problem except that I found out he gave me a fake name. I get opsec is a thing, but if you don’t even want to give out a real first name or be up front with the fact that you aren’t, maybe this isn’t the thing for you. Also, the fact that he suddenly changed his tune about me going with him after he went for the first time means he’s probably working on someone else. 

Which would be fine except we had discussed what we both wanted in the beginning. He had stated something different than having multiple APs at once. Naturally, if he was being this shady after weeks of talking all day and most nights and even meeting up once, there was no way I could believe anything he’d said. I immediately blocked him, but he’s lucky I’m not a terrible person like him. I could have blown up his entire life. 

The crazy thing is the city I live in is literally in the group title. He does not live in the same city. He’s the one who first suggested the place to me, I’d actually forgotten it was there. All that to say this coupled with most of the other guys I’ve talked to on here have made me think I need to meet men somewhere else. I’ve been fed lies and broken promises for 5 years by my H (which is how I got here in the first place). I’m not looking to have to deal with it in an AP as well.

It’s too hard to trust someone until you know them pretty well and ghosting/lack of interest is incredibly common apparently. I only want to meet up with one, then if that doesn’t end up leading anywhere meet another. 

That’s just my preference though. I do believe in honor among thieves, if you will. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with multiple APs as long as everyone understands and is okay with the fact that that’s what the situation will be in the beginning.

Only because I started sleeping with a chair under my doorknob, but anyway. For years I let my mom manipulate and control me. I thought it was my duty to try to repair things with her. As I got older and had my kids, I realized how truly messed up it was that she dismissed me telling her about what happened and then stayed with him. 

I came to realize my mom doesn’t love me the way a mother should, and never will. She just wants someone to love her unconditionally no matter how horrible she acts. She’s a narcissist, and once she realized I saw right through her she only maintained contact hoping my kids could be her new toys. Not happening btw. I allow her to visit now that she understands I won’t put up with her bs, but I never leave her alone with them and never will. 

All that to say I’m so glad you moved out OP. That’s the first step. I won’t tell you what to do, but please just know you do not owe anyone anything. Especially in this situation.

The second is to carry on your end of the conversation. Don’t make her ask all the questions past basics.
