sketchpad,foy3jfj,t3_g9yomh,1588164436.0,The values are too extreme imo. The dark background is too dark to balance with the much lighter foreground. Like two separate aspects. Being these two into harmony in value and I think it would create a nice transition for the eyes. Hope this helps.

NewTubers,f3pf65z,t3_dhjf3p,1571057518.0,I used to. Then I began to work hard to finish an episode and only make one when the topic is inspired. My topic is mental health. I'm enjoying it so much more now. And don't think about it as much when I'm not doing it. (sleeping)

fcpx,f2zou59,t3_deqs39,1570533215.0,Thanks for the update/ update. I'm curious how many editors actually own the new MBP. I'm a stand alone operation so I certainly can't afford new laptops on a whim. Wondering if this update will cause problems with my old MBP. (taking advantage of the 'power').

I've faced my mortality and when I turned back I saw so much fear but still not enough to walk off my own cliff. I don't know why that I can put in words.

LateStageCapitalism,f1zgfna,t3_db41lf,1569843283.0,The phrase I grew up with 'Pull yourself up by your boot straps' to this day makes me nauseous. Way of upper class whites to be 'politely' dismissive of everyone else financial struggle. My family used it often. It sucked. I don't choose to be around them now. Apparently they've been so greedy that they (2 of em) are living mostly alone in their big house with all their money and no one comes to see them. Money never bought them happiness.
