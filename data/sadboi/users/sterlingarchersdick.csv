restaurant,f42no1g,t1_f42m9nk,1571333869.0,"Hijacking my own comment to add that you may also be surprised by how many people actually do want/need jobs, even in a restaurant washing dishes. You could post a ‚Äúhelp wanted‚Äù sign specifying that previous restaurant experience is a requirement, as well as delve into the vast world of the internet. There‚Äôs PLENTY of people out there, both with and without degrees and/or kitchen experience, but if you‚Äôre really paying them that well then you may be surprised by how many more qualified/motivated cooks are in your area who may want to work for you. I know indeed.com is a good place to start but there‚Äôs so many more, even Facebook can be useful, just do some research. :)"
restaurant,f42m9nk,t1_f22dgds,1571333369.0,"This needs more upvotes. Statistically, positive reinforcement (even for employees just doing their jobs and no more) has been proven to be much more effective at motivating people as opposed to berating them for anything they may be doing wrong. Maybe even have a kitchen staff meeting and explain to them how important each individual is to keeping the business afloat; with no restaurant they will have no jobs (be firm, but not threatening). Begin to praise employees who do their jobs correctly and gently approach those who continue to slack off to see if maybe some external force is affecting their quality of work and if so, ask if there‚Äôs anything you can do to help. Basically, just treat them like real people and not numbers in a computer; I guarantee they will respect you more for that and probably be more motivated to do what you ask."

I guess I‚Äôm too trusting of a person because I still hung out with her again after this; the second time we were just hanging out alone in her house very late one night when she randomly ATTACKED me, literally I mean for no fucking reason. She stole all my cash and some other things, I had to call the cops and go to the emergency room.
