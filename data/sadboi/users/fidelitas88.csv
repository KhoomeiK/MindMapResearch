AnxiousAttachment,fnlwdp0,t1_fnf37wg,1587060891.0,"I can definitely relate heavily to this dynamic. I know my anxious attachment issues is a subconscious way to repair the inconsistent parenting of my mother and repairing the childhood core belief of “I am unlovable.” My mother was extremely avoidant (hating even) my father so it is what I’m used to. If I could just get an avoidant partner to love me..then it will proves that I am lovable and I can repair the fucked up relationship my parents had. Of course this is all just a set up for disaster. I am also subconsciously afraid of intimacy even though consciously I want it. This is where the self sabotage of being attracted to partners that I know wouldn’t be a good match will come in. 

I have never really witnessed or experienced a healthy romantic relationship...so it is like navigating through the dark"

Take good care of yourself” 

I hope we would be able to reconnect in the future but I know that is part of my anxious attachment..I think I just have to accept this and move on.

It looks like the company “Zenimei” makes Zenitco replica rails (even has the Russian writing on it) that fits on GHK/LCT AK bodies.

RedWolf Airsoft (HK) seems to have [LCT AEG Z Series Parts](http://m.redwolfairsoft.com/item_detail/249282-LCT+Z+Series+B-11+Classic+Handguard+-+Black) ...I’ve read that ghk Aks are LCT bodies, not sure if AEG parts are compatible though so it may take further research ..[Evike (USA)](https://www.evike.com/products/77099/) carries zenimei parts listed for GHK Aks but a lot of the items are out of stock.Best place to look is [Samoon(Taiwan)](https://samoon.com.tw/conversion-kit/c-ak)  in taiwan since they are a GHK dealer. 

W&S makes a [full bolt travel kit](https://www.gasblowbackcentral.com/products/w-s-airsoft-ghk-ak-bolt-full-travel-kit-for-gas-blowback-rifle-gk74-gk100?variant=39145172492) which I’ve heard good things about

Of course after you get compatible rail systems on your AK, any standard external accessory that fits on the 20mm piccany rail system will work

That is tthe good thing about the WE gbbrs, there are more aftermarket accessories readily available. If you ever need spare parts, you can order them from Asia on kyairsoft.com.
