Yeah, the movie features magic but maybe if you focused on explaining the overall theme about the love of Harry’s parents making him so strong that he is able to defeat evil, she will see it a different way.

My parents were always against piercings and one day I went and got one and while they were mad at me for a bit and hated seeing it on my face, they eventually stopped commenting on it. They realized that I’m an adult and while their opinion matters to me, it’s something I wanted for myself.

Let’s say you get a credit card with a $300 limit and use it to buy work clothes for a brand new job. You need this to grow as a professional (and to make more income) and as long as you’re making your minimum payment of $25, you’re ok. The goal is to eventually pay it off with the money you’re making. If you get fired or your salary decreases to a smaller amount, your quality of life will suffer because you won’t be able to make the payment.

In terms of a large scale economy, it would be very, very difficult. [This](https://www.thebalance.com/will-the-u-s-debt-ever-be-paid-off-3970473) explains how the debt can be scaled down but unless citizens agree to paying more in taxes to cover the spending or there are massive cuts (think social programs like social security and defense spending), I don’t see the debt getting any smaller. 

The United States was actually free of debt at one point. The US debt was fully paid off on [January 8, 1935](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/04/15/135423586/when-the-u-s-paid-off-the-entire-national-debt-and-why-it-didnt-last and the country was completely unprepare) and there was a surplus for a bit until the economy crashed."

For me, I like to get out there a few days after the breakup happens. I’m a big proponent of getting under someone to get over someone.
