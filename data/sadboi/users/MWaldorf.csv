First of all, we should not condone fat shaming just because it’s directed at someone who’s publicly cancelled. If you fat shame to your enemies, it makes you look hypocritical when you say we should get rid of stigmatizing fat people. 

Not to generalize all lib/dem people, but we all know that a majority of the the people who fight for body positivity tend to fall left politically.

Secondly, I know the man isn’t skinny and I have not seen him topless (thank the heavens) but I think morbidly obese was pushing it, Nancy.

I feel like medically induced abortions that have explicit sponsorships by doctors sounds reasonable. Though, I’ve honestly never heard of such of a procedure.

unpopularopinion,fqszw2z,t1_fqsyfc0,1589625044.0,"I have never personally said that me not shaving or wearing bras would be helping younger generations.

I can not speak for everyone who does not shave, though. Obviously not shaving is not “going to help all women” but neither is shaving. At the very least, I could be showing young women/femmes that they don’t have to do exactly what society expects from them. But, then again, I am only one person and only enact so much change.

I must disagree firmly on the taboo thing. It just brings me back to my point of what society expects from people. Society (generally) shows body hair on a woman as a taboo. So some young people may develop some body issues from that taboo.

I am not saying some kids having body issues is the end of the world, or we should be hating on all people who shave because of it, but I do not see why we can not start taking steps towards general acceptance of all types of body hair."
unpopularopinion,fqsxylj,t3_gkpadt,1589622990.0,"Well, I agree that messing around with menstrual blood is at the very least unsanitary. And nobody should be partaking in diy abortions if they have the option! You could seriously hurt yourself doing stuff like that.

But on the main issues of shaving and going braless - I think you are seriously missing the point.

First of all, if a person say they feel empowered when they do something - that’s a very personal thing. It may not have the same affect for you, and I don’t really know if anyone was expecting that of you per se. 

I think in general, a lot of people say that women/femmes not shaving or wearing bras is taboo. Goes against the grain, so maybe those women/femmes get thrilled by doing something outside of the gender stereotypes. 

I know for me personally, I just don’t like to shave. Wastes my time, and I do not need to. But I also do not care what people have to say about it. It’s not necessarily “empowering”, but it feels like I have one less thing to worry about - if that makes sense? 

Maybe for you, or for others, having body hair gives you something to worry about. Then all the more power to you for shaving. Body acceptance ((and feminism)) should not always have to look the same. If you want to shave, feminists should still support you 100% because that’s your body and your decision.
