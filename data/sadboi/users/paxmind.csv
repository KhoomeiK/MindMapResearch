Been trying to mine. I watched a youtube video and am outfitted with pulse analyzer, seismic charger, and prospector/collector limpet. Anyway, it took me a long time but I found a low temp diamond hot spot! Was pscyhed. I cruised around forever, maybe 1+ hours and didn't find a single asteroid with fissures though. Am I doing something wrong? Is it as simple as shooting a prospector limpet at it and it'd show up that way? Just on the contacts screen or as a little thing I can target?

Sometimes things just dawn on you as true or on the right path - and I've found that then if I look at any of the ancient traditions they were also not the same path.

OK so the world is an illusion? I like to think of it we are trapped in a game, like WoW, and we don't even know it. We think killing monsters and getting levels is actually important. But it's not. It's not even ""real"" and you don't get anything for it. In fact, most of it just makes you more unhappy. If you played a MMORPG game and KNEW it was pointless but were playing it anyway what would you do? You would just maximize the fun you’re having and the happiness (minimize the suffering) of the other people even if they didn’t realize it was a game with no purpose. You’d do things to physically end pain but also just help people realize closer and closer to the Truth (""the world is an illusion""). If others start realizing it too they can also see that all these animalistic urges are mostly leading us to unhappiness and we should go towards the things that actually  make us feel good AND other people feel good (not hurt them) because that’s all we really can do. That’s all we can do, we’re all just little accidents without a purpose and we might as well help everyone just have fun."

So I'm here just telling myself how irrational I am (which feels like ""you are stupid"") and it's not helpful.

One thing that is useful, that although stoics didn't say it I think that with our current understanding of the mind they'd agree, you cannot 100% control your emotions at least not without years if not decades of mental training. It's not some switch you just turn on and no longer feel a certain way.

It was, like you said, and OCD moment where I'm trying to recall all books, advice, mantra, etc. I would be good for a second but the chemicals in my brain telling me I was frustrated were still there (they stick around a while!) so when I forgot whatever thread I had that ""helped"" I'd basically be right back in it.

Anyway, one of my novelties I've used recently:

If you can't accept it, accept that you can't accept it. If you can't accept that you can't accept it, then regress again. Accept that you can't accept your unacceptance. Once you can accept something about the negative emotion, situation, event etc it helps pull the thread to unraveling."

&#x200B;

If you are going to true failure or beyond (drop sets, restpause, forced reps, whatever) then the volume you can recover from is much lower (maybe 6 sets a week?).

&#x200B;

Which one works better? There are giants doing either one and they think the other side is dumb. Some think that each individual has a type of training they respond to better but IMO it comes down to preference. I've done both and like higher volume because I have the tendency to cheat or use momentum when going to failure and beyond (herniated disk to prove it). I pay the price in more time in the gym and more joint/tendon fatigue though..

&#x200B;

Either way make sure you're hitting all heads. The simplest way to think about it is you need to do movements where your triceps are low (think cable pressdown) and high (skullcrusher).

&#x200B;

Edit: And mainly, you have to be in for the long haul. You're not going to pull up a lagging body part in a matter of weeks, it'll take months or even a year to make a difference sometimes (unless you were just totally neglecting the body part and gonna get noobie gains all over again)."
