I read in a book I am reading ""We think we can stand near it, and if we don't think about it, we'll have the victory. The problem is, *the more we try not to concentrate on it the more it becomes the center of our focus...the longer we think about not submitting the more likely it is that we will.""* We definitely need to let God fight our battles because we are not strong enough because like it says in Matthew 26, the flesh is weak but the Spirit is willing."
NoFap,flcjavo,t3_fdacbe,1585033075.0,"Hi, I'm Aaron, and I'm a porn addict. I've always wanted to have like a group of people who struggled with this addiction to come together everyday and share their thoughts. We could keep track of each other and build each other up, and most importantly be there for one another. The driving force for alcoholism is loneliness, but I think that can I apply to people who suffer from all addictions. Not every person suffers from loneliness but I think everyone needs a person to there for good and bad times. Anyways, I am still searching for a group like this but haven't found one yet."
