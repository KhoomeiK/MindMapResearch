Pros:
-Probably won’t bite momma’s weird nipple off

-Healthy milk ish snack for the murder cat

- not a peach slicer

Cons:

-cat tongues are sandpapery

-claws holding balls in place of this lady’s arm

-fear may inhibit performance, which could enrage the kitty

But I mean, really a panther compared too all the other hit on that sub, like, not so bad"

Vaping,flv1zrq,t3_frcpos,1585514726.0,"Hello r/vaping! I’ve come bearing a success story at long last. Telling this is mostly my way of properly thanking J_L_D for his dutiful service in getting me here.

Awhile ago, I found myself unable to buy any coils from my local vape shop and the two other closest only had three between them. I baught them all, and then looked for another more sustainable way to get my Candy clouds. Online, coils were waaaay too much for me to regularly afford. Eventually, I came to the conclusion I needed to try a rebuildable.

I went to my local vape shop and asked for an RTA setup, and they said they had none in stock. Asked for an RDA after and the man said that type of vaping was - in his own words, “fizzling out”. Disappointed, I called three other shops and the fourth closest in the next town over had “a few in stock” after the 20 minute drive I purchased the rebirth shown in this picture. 

I had no experience prior to this and asked my man behind the counter to show me how it was done. He pulled out a little jar of ten coils for half the price of one falcon coil and then searched around for cotton. He popped one coil in and fed some cotton through - after messing up about half the sheets in the bag trying to get one off. He said I’d get the bag for free. My man got that coil in and cotton wicked with just his fingers and gave it to me for a try. It was awful, but I still baught the rta and 20 coils with the cotton free. On the way home it leaked out all the juice he’d put in onto my hand and car seat.

So, I swapped back to the falcon and used it until the last coil I ever found for it was getting bitter and gross and the tank started leaking. I swapped over to the rebirth and tried the process he showed me for adding in another coil because I’d done research and found out it leaked because if only having one. I put cotton through the coils first and then installed and mashed them over the airflows with my thumbs like I was shown in the shop. I posted to reddit a picture like this one and a title saying I wasn’t impressed. I was starting to think Rebuildables were just a meme I’d been suckered into.

That’s when my guardian angel, u/J_L_D commented on my post and later added me on discord. He walked me through properly positioning and wicking the coil all while kicking ass in borderlands. After all as said and done the flavor was on point and I now have enough supplies to last me through quarantine. Thank you man. Thank you so much"
