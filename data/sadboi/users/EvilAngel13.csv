Especially as you move past the casual dating phase and start planning a future. 

When a relationship is serious and long term and moves towards more of a ""family"" dynamic, especially after moving in together, it does change. 

In a real and functioning family no one comes first all the time.  Life just doesn't work that way.  Granted, the age of the kid/kids in question matters.  Infants and toddlers take up a ton of time and attention and a relationship will probably not be a priority as often as you may like to a parent at that point but kids grow up, become more independent, and eventually move out and start their own lives. 

Even with school-age kids, it is possible (and healthier) to put every member of the household first at times.  No relationship will ever last if your partner prioritizes the kids over the couple 100% of the time.  When a couple shares biokids no one blinks an eye when they put their relationship first at times.  A couple with children from prior relationships should feel NO guilt for doing the same."

What is the point of asking for that? Now this poor woman he was married to for 30 years gets to second guess her entire life and question if he ever really loved her or was he settling instead of having her happy, positive memories of their time together. Why do that to her? Why make her question if he ever loved her? Why send such a blatant message that she was his second choice and he would rather have had his first? What good does that do for anyone?  He will still be dead. The ex is dead. It isnt like he can admit his mistakes and go put the relationship with his ex back together again.

To me (us), in love is about the butterflies and the excitement, the passion, that giddy feeling when your person is due home any time, slow dancing to love songs alone in the kitchen,  wanting to be touching that person all the time.  Much of what you said DOES sound like being ""in love"" to me...loving without being ""in love"" I see as more the way you feel about your best friend or your sibling.

And, again, difficult depends on the situation and and the specifics of why that person would be considered difficult. Sometimes, ""easy"" people can be incredibly boring or without a whole lot of depth or passionless.  There is a saying that things that are worthwhile are never easy or something along those lines (having a brain fart and can't remember the exact wording of the saying).

Whether or not those traits are something positive deoends a LOT on the specific person and the specific situation.

Eye color isn't something that matters to me when it comes to being attracted to someone but I can have zero attraction whatsoever to guys who are as small or smaller than I am.  I am 5'2 and weigh between 95 and 100 lbs.  So not being larger than me is rare in an adult man but I have known a few and it is a turn off to me.

To me, there are many distinct types of love.  The love I feel for my mother which is different than the love I feel for my kids which is different than the love I feel for my husband etc.  Im not sure there are words to explain the differences really but, for me, there  is a clear difference in the way the emotion feels. 

Part of that obviously has to do with sexual attraction but that isn't all if it or even the biggest piece.  Part of it probably has to do with attachment as well.  You raise kids knowing that at some point they will move out and live their own lives but you marry believing that person with be right there beside you forever.

I still get a little giddy when I know he will be home from work soon.  

If my husband had said to me what yours did, I would  not be able to stay.  I refuse to settle for someone who is not in love with me or who I am not in love with. I could never be happy like that. I want more. Hell, I would almost say I NEED more to be truly happy in my life. That sounds melodramatic but it is absolutely true.  Real love is a core emotional need for me."
Marriage,fnwqguq,t3_g49npx,1587323439.0,"It depends on a whole lot of things. Yes it is possible to fall out of love and back in...but you don't always necessarily want that.  Sometimes, that person you have been married to for years is no longer what you want in a partner forever.  You can grow. They can grow.  And sometimes you grow in very different directions that don't work together.  Sometimes, that person loses whatever it is that created the attraction and the chemistry...or maybe you lose what made them feel that way for you. There is nothing wrong with choosing to move on. 

I know, for me, I could never be happy in a long term relationship where the excitement and butterflies and in love feelings were gone. If I wanted a lifelong friendship with someone I wouldn't be sleeping next to them every night and having sex with them so I need something more than friendship with my husband.  I have plenty of good friendships and friends that I love.  But in order to be happy and have a lasting marriage I need to be IN LOVE with my husband and I don't feel that trying to recapture those feelings is always possible and I don't have the patience to try for months or years and waste that time trying to find it that I could be spending finding love and being happy with someone else who is a better fit."

unpopularopinion,fnbfhhx,t3_g0oq8g,1586814610.0,"Yeah. I definitely agree. There is no reason answering a phone, filing, data entry, reception, billing etc should require a degree. 

College is not for everyone and there is absolutely nothing wrong with choosing not to go. The current ""college as a necessity "" culture we are living in has made having ""just a bachelors degree"" mean next to nothing and people who go no further get stuck in lower paying jobs that require next to no skills and where advancement is unlikely that used to go to people without any higher education (secretary, hospital admissions, billing, data entry,  low level management, etc etc). It is quickly getting to the point that having a bachelor's degree means nothing and if you are looking for. stability, room to advance and a decent living wage you have to rack up even more student loans and spend several MORE years going to school for a Masters or a Doctorate."

But she had wished her very stoic mother had shown and vocalized  love more and that made her so sad when she was little that when I came along she didnt want to make me feel that way ever and she went against her natural tendency to be the same and was very affectionate and tells me she loves me often.  She is the poster child for fake it til you make it tho because before long any discomfort she may have felt inside dissipated and it became second nature"

Your heart is in the right place but other people's relationships are not your concern and letting yourself get so wrapped up in them is never a good idea.  The cheater will screw up and get themselves caught a large percentage of the time.   Instead of overstepping, I have found it is much better to keep your mouth shut but be there to be a caring friend when it happens."

family,fn7q8mr,t3_g03iil,1586725431.0,It is time to pursue a more adult relationship with your parents.  Have conversations with them rather than seek guidance.  Share opinions and discuss interests and introduce them to books/movies/music/plays/tv shows that may be new to them...I have found that talking about shared interests that don't carry an emotional undercurrent can lead to seeing each other more as fellow adults rather than parent/child which I have found leads to a more genuine and real relationship.
unpopularopinion,fn7pn9b,t1_fn7p61l,1586725094.0,But they wont be safe and happy.  Telling someone they are being cheated on is not going to make their lives any happier and being nosy is a serious dick move too.

unpopularopinion,fn7c5zf,t1_fn7bpk4,1586717432.0,Not in situations I have witnessed.  The person being cheated on has a tendency to not want to think their partner would do that to them and the person doing the telling ends up getting accused of lying and blamed for trying to cause problems or being jealous or having it out for them etc etc. Most people would rather think their friend is a liar than believe the person they love isn't faithful.

I prefer men friends to this day also though it isn't about the attention or the puppy love anymore.  I just happen to enjoy male company more for the most part mostly because of style of humor and shared interests and an innate distrust of most women. lol."

unpopularopinion,fn76tcl,t3_fzw2bi,1586714409.0,"With the way money is today and the cost of living, raising kids on one income can be very challenging. 

Plus, not every parent is cut out to be home with kids all day every day. That doesn't make someone a bad parent.  In fact, having the chance to have something else that you find meaningful can make you a better parent. 

There isn't anything wrong with choosing to stay home with your kids.  I did when mine were little and I am now again to help with my granddaughter.  But it was my choice to do so.  For me, that is what feminism was all about: giving women a choice to pursue whatever career she wants or to choose to stay home with kids...and both choices are valid."
unpopularopinion,fn726l7,t3_fzud2f,1586711846.0,"That depends on the crime committed. Time should not be wasted rehabilitating murderers, pedophiles or rapists.

unpopularopinion,fn6znmw,t3_fzu6pf,1586710457.0,I don't disagree but I also see nothing wrong with choosing to dress sexy and sexualizing yourself if you want to.  I enjoy feeling sexy and the looks and attention is fun and good for the ego sometimes.
unpopularopinion,fn6za8o,t3_fzoujb,1586710257.0,"They are for the parents. I love parties and celebrations and I loved celebrating my babies first birthdays with friends and family.  When they get older, it becomes more for the kids themselves but the first few are for the parents-and there isn't a thing wrong with that. 

No, the expense and the effort isn't ""necessary "" but most things done for fun and enjoyment aren't. That's kind of the point. Why be judgy about it? If you don't want to do it, just don't do it. Why worry about what other people choose to do?"
relationship_advice,fn6gezq,t3_fznvhn,1586698576.0,Honestly I don't think it is that big of a deal.  There was clearly drinking involved. She has had an obvious crush. The girl he was trying to take home wouldnt go. She made herself available.  Everyone involved is young. This shit happens. The only way I would be truly bothered would be if he lied to her and told her he had feelings he didnt have or that there was a chance for some sort of actual relationship to get down her pants. Otherwise Id just let it go.
AmItheAsshole,fn6f7jn,t1_fn51odl,1586697625.0,"It is a hurtful thing to say though.  Especially knowing that he is clearly close to his family.  Also, its a matter of opinion whether what she had to say is ""common sense"" or not. Not everyone still holds the more traditional, ""old school"" ideals any more. The world works in more than 1 ""right way"" these days and that is a beautiful thing.

Now, I will say that he should have known what she was going to say or at least sensed some of it and let it lay if his desire was a lasting, loving relationship with her.  Those words aren't going away so now he has to decide whether he can live happily with her knowing her feelings about his family who he is obviously close to and loves very much or not.  Thata That's not an easy decision for someone in his position with that sort of closeness with his family after what she said about them."
AmItheAsshole,fn4vkc7,t3_fzgqkl,1586649915.0,I think she is the asshole for openly judging your family.  I would honestly consider ending things if my husband ever said something like that about my family.
Parenting,fn423x0,t1_fn3lfdk,1586632502.0,"Hm. So having more than 1 child makes it impossible to ever focus on any one child as an individual?  Im sure my 5 kids would disagree with that sentiment. 

And first words/smile/steps/poop on the potty are not  special individual accomplishments.  Every human being on the planet that isnt developmentally disabled does those things.   Yes, its a cute, happy moment from babyhood but it isn't something individual or particularly special and it isn't like the kid remembers and feels slighted. 

There is a whole lot more value to celebrating true individual accomplishments with your children like making the All Star baseball team or winning the elementary school spelling bee or making varsity football or cheerleading or landing a starring role on the school musical.  Those sort of accomplishments truly are individual and every kid isn't doing the exact same thing around the same time and yes, those sort of things are a LOT more memorable because it isnt just a developmental milestone every kid does eventually."
Parenting,fmsscus,t1_fmsra9y,1586361238.0,"In some situations you would be absolutely right but there are kids that can be manipulative and cruel and  conniving from a very young age.  Which is why I hesitate to assign motives or lack thereof to the 8 yr old girl in the OP. There isn't enough information to realistically judge either way.  But I don't think its fair to the child to automatically assume she is being purposely manipulative but it isn't fair to the gifriend to assume she isn't either. When I was 8 I will admit right now I was certainly capable of being manipulative and conniving and I would have done everything in my power to tank any relationship my mom had attempted to have because I didn't want to share her and I was selfish as Hell, lol.  I have apologized to my poor mother so many times for the way I was back then lol."
Parenting,fmsppi9,t1_fmso2pb,1586359990.0,"I respectfully disagree that 2 years is too soon. For a child that young, 2 years is a long time.  I do get what you are saying about her not purposely excluding dad's gf and that is probably true but that doesn't make it hurt less and his method of handling it didnt make it any better and I can say from experience that  this is the sort of thing that causes a parent's partner to step back and disengage for self preservation.  Opening yourself up and feeling rejected hurts a lot and you can only feel that way so many times before you start building walls if your partner (OP) isn't handling it with kindness, reassurance and plenty of love.  The child isn't the only one who needs and deserves love and reassurance.  Feeling like an outsider in what you see as your own family in your own home hurts like Hell."
Parenting,fmsmb6s,t1_fmskkyb,1586358221.0,"""She just wants to spend more time with her family "" That sentence sums up everything that is hurting the OPs partner.  She sees them all as a family together but sd does not and her partner isnt correcting the daughter and making it clear that the partner is an important part of their family also.  I wouldn't want to stay in a long term live in relationship with a man who was ok treating me like an outsider either.  If it were a new relationship that would be different but at this point they should be a family together. All of them.  Not a family and then an outsider."
unpopularopinion,fms8c9j,t3_fwztrt,1586349516.0,"Don't get me wrong.  I am not defending people who cheat in any way and if the person being cheated on is someone especially close to you my opinion is different than it would be if it is someone more distant.  

If it is a neighbor, an aquaintance, a coworker or a friend you aren't particularly close to all telling on the cheater is going to do is make you look like a nosy busybody and, chances are, they won't even believe you because they trust their partner more than a random person they don't know all that well.
