cookingforbeginners,fqvt7g5,t3_gl6tb1,1589684631.0,"I saut√©e veggies like bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms in a skillet on medium high with a little olive oil. Wait til the oil it hot, then drop them in. If the pan is smoking- it‚Äôs too hot. Lower the temp. Putting a lid on top will steam them and soften them quicker. Stir and flip frequently. Toward the end you might want to pour a tiny bit of water in and stir the veggie around. It lifts up the nice brown stuff stuck to the bottom of the pan, and coats the veggies. When they‚Äôre pretty close to being done, leave the kid off. Cook until they‚Äôre soft enough for your liking and throw on some garlic salt and pepper. 

Tip: add mushrooms about 5 minutes after you start because they cook faster. 

I add these veggies on to tons of stuff like egg scrambles, on top of grilled chicken, or anything that sounds good."

With the red food color I‚Äôm using (an off brand from smart and final grocery), 2 tablespoons was a bit too much. It would have been great with about 1.5 tbsp I think. I mean, unless you want your tongue and fingers stained red. 

The directions say to bake at 325F for 30-35 minutes, but I bake mine for 45. At 35 minutes the batter is still jiggly in the center. 45 minutes and they‚Äôre great. But, everyone‚Äôs oven is different.
