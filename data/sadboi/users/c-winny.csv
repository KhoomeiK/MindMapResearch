1. Just apply. Doesn't matter if you think thing you're unqualified / won't get that first interview, just do it. You have nothing to lose and more to gain.
2. Keep your resume to one page if possible unless what you've posted up is just to share the breadth of experience you have.

It's tough to suggest things because there's *quite* a lot of on your resume... I'm seeing a lot of data entry, federal / public sector experience, customer / user support roles... etc.

Your skills on the right help but what is it that you want to do? There are quite a lot of people that bounce to different jobs / industries / etc. and they are able to do so because they have a cohesive story that tells why they made the moves they did and they they're taking the next steps they are.

I take the gargantuan, overwhelming deliverables or responsibilities I have and find some small things that I can really easily and quickly complete that contributes towards my goal. It could be something as small as, ""Send an email to X"" or ""Fill out timesheet"". Even if the big deliverables don't get done, it helps me rationalize the work and my thoughts so it's not just an endless sea of work. You can also see the tangible progress that you've made which puts you ahead of where you were in the beginning of the day.

This usually helps motivate me and that in itself becomes a small domino effect... the more motivated I am, the more tasks I tackle and cross off my list.

Making those 'egregious mistakes' and then feeling all the shame/guilt/etc. and then afterwards forcing myself to come to terms with the fact that the actual consequences aren't as bad as what I once thought.

I had to go into another piercer who couldn't put it back in for me because they were booked (ok) so I put it back in myself (yikes!) but luckily have had no problems with it falling out since then.

About a week ago, I noticed irritation bumps around my rook, with the bottom hole looking more gnarly than the top. I got pretty paranoid and got some SSS from walgreens and have been spraying with H2Ocean and using a qtip at night with the saline spray.

When I use the q-tip, I notice that some scabbies come off and it bleeds a bit. The piercing throbs in pain every once in a while (think like, similar to a migraine throb). Not warm to the touch.

I bump into the piercing every once in a while and avoid sleeping on it. I'm worried it's getting infected and cruising through other reddit threads have made me super paranoid about my piercing aftercare.
