Hypermobility,fjy8ige,t1_fjy4i5b,1583691922.0,"Greetings from across the pond but naproxen is sold next to the acetaminophen and aspirin in the US. Naproxen is a breath mint compared to opiate pain killers. Hey, if naproxen works, work it/use it. My experience with hypermobility is that my lower back as well as many other parts of my body ache with so much pain that I would have audibly laughed if someone said take a naproxen for this. Then I might have thrown something at them. Someone offering me naproxen for this is a bit like someone with a broken back being offered a topical bandage and a wooden spoon as ""medical treatment"". I am super jealous of your NHS but if you're needing something more stout, I'd schedule an appointment with your GP and maybe explain the depth of the pain without leaving any room for doubt. Sqeeky wheels get the oil. Always make sure to speak up in medical exams. It is difficult especially with the ""let's just breeze right through this"" behavior some doctors have. Keep a log of how bad things get. Activities you've had to abstain from, levels of pain reached, etc. But be sure: naproxen is level 1 armor. This hypermobility is at a minimum of something much farther into the video game. Hypermobility is the boss you fight while continuing to battle your way deep into the maze of the video game of life. Unfortunately, my perspective is definitely one of an American. 

America: where we vote for reality show judges as president and throw opiates at our public until opiate overdoses kill more Americans than motor vehicle accidents. 100% serious on both of those btw."
Hypermobility,fjy5sje,t3_f9h2yf,1583690392.0,"(I'm) Not a doctor or really any profession to be trusted without consulting a doctor. I was diagnosed in November of this year. Here what I've discovered: there are physical things I should be doing everyday like swimming, cold compresses (with ice packs on my joints), getting enough exercise, not getting too much of the wrong physical activities, there's always something I should be doing, much akin to my brushing my teeth three times a day and getting all my servings of vegetables. Then there's the daily maintenance that I have to do or my body doesn't really work: basically yoga or stretching. Then there's the medicine: pain killers. The sad part is that with the best cutting edge medical tech, I'm on dilaudid. I'm on the 2020 version of medical opium or at least I'm working my way on being dependent on something like it. 


Tl;dr  Daily: stretch, take your pain meds unless you can operate without them (haha), and exercise like your doctor told you. Mine told me swimming as it's really low impact. Not sure what yours said. Repeat until something else in the body stops working or starts hurting. Maybe rethink career choices."
Hypermobility,fjy3r6k,t3_fea9ak,1583689233.0,Yes. Hypermobility hits the joints that fight against gravity the hardest. I bought a walking cane. There are stretching/ yoga activities you can do to lower your chances of what sounds to be a subluxation of your hip. I'd ask a doctor or someone for the best ones specifically for you.

Hypermobility,fjy385m,t3_ff0ld7,1583688931.0,"Naproxen? Holy sh... Ok. I'm not medically schooled in the least but I do know a little bit about some pharmaceuticals. I was diagnosed this past year: when the back and hip pain was so bad that my GP referred me to my rheumatologist, my rheumatologist started me on the opiate track. It starts with Percocet 7.5/325s. I've had to move off of percocet as my stomach didn't tolerate the tylenol so great but what you want to decide is: am I going down the opiate hole? It starts with percocet; it ends with you either taking a super high dose of something else at an older age or it ends with you taking suboxone in rehab. (In the US, Suboxone is only prescribed for opiate addiction disorders, not treatment for pain). Opiates work great when you need pain relief and sleep. But your body works just as hard at not being (what it feels as) intoxicated. The percocet pushes all the right buttons to let you sleep and walk (speaking from experience). Bad part is your body is going to replace those buttons with new buttons which do feel pain. What happens? You need more percocet, or more dilaudid, or more morphine, or (insert scary opiate). Suboxone only pushes your buttons down 40% of the way so your pain is mostly taken care of but your body doesn't feel the need to replace its buttons. Like I said, the problem with suboxone in the US is it's only prescribed for opiate addiction disorders NOT pain. Crazy side note: suboxone is an opiate based pain stopper it's just different than all the other ones used to treat pain. Also, on suboxone, you only get one dosage. It doesn't change. You never end up upping or changing the dose.

Tl;dr Go to a rheumatologist from a GP referral. They can give you opiates unless you don't want opiates. I didn't have a choice: I needed to sleep. Just beware of the mess they bring into your life. (Not that I really had a choice given the pain.)"

I sincerely hope it helps to know that what it appears you're feeling is essentially the starvation of the good brain chemicals. I don't  know how much about brain chemistry you know but you do need to know you've done nothing wrong to feel this way. It's an unfortunate medical illness but there is medicine and many people willing to help you have/obtain your own reasons to live. I could give you my reason I choose to live but it wouldn't be the same for you. Something that I see giving me hope is that if I look (sometimes really hard sometimes just right next to me) there is someone or some fur ball that genuinely wants to help me not feel like I don't deserve something. And because I sometimes need help, it gives me hope that as long as I'm willing to look there are people who want to bare part of my burden to help me get out of where I am so my life is at least less of a living hell and more of like at the beach (in hell) but at least I'm near water when I'm in hell.

I don't know your situation really anymore than your headline but I do know that there are people who want to help you take care of yourself when it's your darkest hour so you do continue living but healthier living.

Excuse me. What I meant to say before my inner demon broke free of his lamp is that I'd contact your students with disabilities coordinator if you wouldn't want this to happen to you or any other disabled people in the future. Unfortunately it seems he needs to be told by someone within an authority position that what he did was highly inappropriate. As an adult, he should have known better but as a professor he should have been able to teach people to know better than to do something like that. IMO, highly inappropriate almost to the point of contacting legal representation. You do not have to disclose at any point in a classroom that you have a disability. When he took that from you, he exposed your (having of a) disability without your permission. Basically the same thing as a pharmacist saying over an intercom ""hey! (Full legal name) you forgot you ointment for your (illness),"" which is a violation of HIPAA. I'm not a lawyer but that's how I understand the law."

If the event that started the fight never leaves your consciousness, that's a whole other thing but don't let doing good change your outlook on the good still left in the world. Do what you want but always be sure you're doing it for yourself and never for ""the principle of the matter"" even though the situation most definitely warrants something to be done. Care for your causes as much as you can but don't lose yourself in fighting injustice. The warriors who don't know which battles to fight in come back only as memories of the people they once were.

Now, I'm 32: some days my back hurts so bad I can't get out of bed unless I take some opioid for the pain. I use a cane to get around. Some parts of my body have always clicked and popped. I am weaker than I was but now I'm having to live with not being able to use this joint/ that joint. Someone mentioned that things start speeding up (in a bad way) in the early 30's. I haven't started physical therapy; maybe that can slow the progression. If anyone in their 40's or 50's wants to speak up as to what's there to expect: I'd like to know if my next vehicle needs to be able to have a wheelchair lift on it or whether I should just wait until the warmer weather returns."

BipolarReddit,f76xlil,t3_dudrrm,1573438447.0,"I wish I could offer some concrete advice on how to fix your situation. In my personal experience, this feeling can disappear but it can also come back. Also from my personal experience, if you keep looking you will keep finding. Hopefully you will find someone worth keeping around but remember this feeling of not feeling good enough doesn't come from finding that ""right"" other person, it comes from seeking help for the feelings as to why you feel like you lack something/someone/anything. In my experience, these deep questions only give deep answers when I've sought advice from licensed therapists."
ChronicPain,f76vfje,t3_duiwl1,1573436822.0,Here's hoping you get out of the hospital so you can get some decent food. What's the first meal you're going to get when you get out?
ChronicPain,f72b680,t3_du58q8,1573357603.0,"Yes, I do. Different reasons kind of. My chronic pain gets worse when it gets cold. And it gets worse every year. As it's not even winter, yes I'm scared of February. And even when the warm weather comes, time never stops ticking. The cold will come back as will the pain, only worse than the year before. I'm 32 not young enough to be young not old enough to be old. And the pain gets worse each year. So, I just sit, much like you, just watching 2019 become the rest of my life. You're not alone."

bipolar,f72496d,t3_du4o3l,1573353307.0,"How accurate. Her foot is just above the water's surface. Undoubtedly, if the foot could see, it would see its own reflection in the water: the point in time when one thinks ""is this mania? Yep, this is mania. That means depression is to follow,"" but the depression has yet to start even a drop. Sorry, that's my take on it.
I love this. I'd take it with me to my psychiatrist meetings and my therapist meetings to describe where I am, was, have been, and will be."
