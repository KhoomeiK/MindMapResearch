yuumimains,fohbzwz,t3_g7czcn,1587763429.0,"All of my duos love Yuumi. Usually, I think it’s best duo someone from another lane because they will get more xp and can carry harder. If we have a functioning team (no afks/each lane 10 deaths) we can effectively carry nearly every game.

They hate Yuumi because they don’t understand her. They call her a leach even though they’re botlane and share their xp anyways lol.

These ADCs don’t understand how to lane, cs, or play passively and can only get ahead when their busted tank support ccs the enemy for 75% of their hp.

The biggest part is also kiting: low elo adcs can’t kite, so they don’t make much use of your heal (you can’t save a squishy from running in 1v9 and getting hit by every ability bc they can’t dodge), shield, or speed up.

I went from 30% wr to 60% wr on yuumi and am still increasing. I honestly believe she is very strong, but has so many weaknesses that solo q is not the place for her.

8/10 Games my adc cries and says something about not picking Yuumi. If you do pick Yuumi and anyone on the team misperforms it’s automatically fault for the loss, because you should’ve been ganking top, jungle, and mid while  winning your own lane. And if you do manage to roam they’ll just kick you out for being a leach and/or ks :3."

I am genuinely concerned for his safety and have told him multiple times to just find another girl who is not shady and is not going to hurt you but he is absolutely fixated on her.

I am not willing to let someone I love and intend to be friends with get hurt by something that is out of his control. 

I definitely agree I should not have sent her death threats or threatened my life I was just very overwhelmed. Not that that’s an excuse, because obviously I know I am wrong for doing that."

I also know this is not him making a situation because he’s really not into drama and he thought I was the one pretending to be Sue at first because our messages are like in sync almost.

We found out this is because what Henry tells Sue, she tells to John, then John tells me, and and I fell Henry. I have also called with him and can confirm he speaks Russian. No one has ever called with her but she sent him a video saying his name."
catfish,f8v7gzr,t1_f8v70rr,1574862001.0,"I definitely believe John and Sue are the same person. I believe he has not had concerns before because he does not truly have a problem with anything.

I know him and it really feels like he is being forced into this based on stuff John says.

“but he made it clear yesterday i thought” and telling me I have no chance because he is with her now. Also with Henry telling me stuff like I NEED to do this or I HAVE to leave you.

It feels like I am purposely being messed with and targeted and they are hurting him because of me honestly.

I am not ready to give up a promising relationship over something like this, but I really appreciate your advice and comments as it’s nice to see i’m not alone in thinking that they are pretending to be two people?"
