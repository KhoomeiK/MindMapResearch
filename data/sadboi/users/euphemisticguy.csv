I am aware then that I'm in a bad place mentally (especially, especially, mentally), and I am not compatible with dating. I insisted on it, and learned my lesson hard. 

I think you have to think about your state now before engaging in tht world. Maybe you need to fix stuff within you that will take time and life to happen before you can say you're ready to find that someone. Ask yourself, what can you do to try and improve in a way that will not be toxic? Yeah, experience with these relationships may be good to know what nots, but is it really worth the hurt?

mentalhealth,fmec168,t3_fuqivt,1585998216.0,"I have a similar experience, though I think the factors for me were the Internet, loneliness, depression and no drug in any spectrum.

Back in my 14-year-old self, I experienced a major panic attack in the room where my mother is living because of something I read on the Internet about cancer and self-diagnosing because of symptoms and such. Since then, and after many negative feelings and experience, I didn't want to be in the room again anymore, and my mum's house. Luckily, I was only staying there for summer vacation. Few years have already passed by, and I'm staying in my mum's for college now and it's been good/better.

I think maybe he had a bad stream of consciousness and have had a bad experience while he was in his room. It has something to do with the association of thoughts, feelings, experience to physical environment.
