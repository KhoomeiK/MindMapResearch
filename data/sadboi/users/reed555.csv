TheWayWeWere,fqdeyvm,t1_fqd25yd,1589288169.0,"Good question, and the Japanese word for ‚ÄúForeigner‚Äù is usually transliterated as ‚Äúgaijin.‚Äù  (You were very close!)

It wasn‚Äôt too hard for Dad because he was in Okinawa, and lived among pro-American Japanese.   Japanese, like other countries, have their folks who look abroad and are very welcoming to foreigners.  Then my Dad had a long career as a U.S. diplomat, so a lot of their married life consisted of them adapting to cultures and countries that were new to both of them.  Mom had to adapt more than he did, sometimes living in Washington DC area, and abroad figuring out how to run a household in a foreign country while dad got to go to a workplace not that radically different from his last one.   We never went back to live in Japan, which was sad for Mom.

I am so sorry that your friend‚Äôs father had a hard time there.  You will definitely find streaks of insularity, xenophobia, sexism and racism in Japan, still.   I have not lived there since I was a toddler, and have only briefly visited a few times since.  Not all foreigners are equal.  If you are black you may well encounter discrimination, and certainly there are some extremely sad stories of Black/Japanese children left behind by servicemen who suffered the double stigma of being both of color and fatherless.  The history of Koreans in Japan is also a sad one, full of discrimination and suffering.  As for sexism, in the 90‚Äôs I remember an older Japanese cousin being *extremely* happy for me when he learned my corporate job at the time wasn‚Äôt just getting coffee for men.  

It is not an easy culture to come into as an outsider because of the difficulty of the language and the cultural differences that you need to study Japanese history/culture to be able to understand.   We are all shaped by our history and circumstances.  Back in the 60‚Äôs, to be truly Japanese you had to commit to growing up in Japan ‚Äî i think it‚Äôs telling that my mother allowed me to forget the Japanese I learned as a toddler ‚Äî  i wasn‚Äôt ever going to be Japanese in the full sense, i just wanted to blend in with other kids, and my mom had enough other things to worry about.  

But there are ways to handle it positively, and have positive experiences as a foreigner.  My brother (who is much younger that me) invested the effort to learn Japanese starting in high school and college, and then lived in Japan for several years.  He married a wonderful Japanese woman and they are raising their son to be bilingual (currently in U.S., but with an eye to perhaps returning to Japan someday.)  My brother is really fluent and even takes on the body language when he is in Japanese mode, it‚Äôs cool actually.  There are Japanese who look down on ‚Äúhafus‚Äù (‚Äúhalves‚Äù) like my brother and me, but far more who are friendly and complimentary about it.  To a Japanese eye, Eurasians can look exotically attractive, without seeming completely alien.  

A view from another angle:  the United States can be very hard on foreigners too - my Japanese sister-in-law was at first very reluctant to move to the U.S., because her exchange student experiences were (frankly) kind of scary and lonely ones in West Virginia and in Detroit.  It took several visits to Northern Virginia and family vacations in Ohio to change her mind.
