memes,fnx7r2p,t1_fnx4ksg,1587333146.0,"its not my feelings, its just that if you want to scream at people and be emotionally unstable then youve lost my respect. As for a ""simple change"" it changes what is fundamental about the human race. I also like how you make me sound weak and emotionally traumatized when they are the ones who need to scream to be heard and smear their shit around everywhere to be noticed. you can downvote me and everything else but the fact is a great many of people think this way, they're just too spineless to speak."

However I wont be pushed into something over someones feelings. you can do whatever as long as it doesnt push things too far. that goes multiple ways.

I dont know if its going to be better but I try, if not for me then I try for others. At school I see that a lot of kids are going through shit too, so I try my best to help them, even if its just a smile. Little things can make a big difference. There might not be help where you are now but people do care. Just hang in there a little longer, things might get better, and if they dont what do you really lose? you might have really shitty days, and if nothing else you can always message me."
