They did away with the abbreviations to keep people from making mistakes but we make more mistakes now than we ever have. Also the stores I‚Äôve worked at haven‚Äôt sold green olives or feta cheese so idk what the abbreviations for those actually were but I assumed them, same for pickles I‚Äôve only ever sold them once & I can‚Äôt remember if that‚Äôs the correct abbreviation or not lol."

Art,fgky1ge,t1_fgkxlsc,1580876384.0,It actually took about a week or so! I work 55+ hours a week so it‚Äôs been an after work project.

HealthAnxiety,ffyb0a1,t3_evrss6,1580342153.0,I relate to this so much. I finally had a breakdown the other night. I had just taken my clothes off to get in the shower & started having a panic attack. My boyfriend made me write down every symptom I thought I had. By the time I was done I must‚Äôve had 20 or more symptoms. & Then I realized that I had been nakedly ugly crying in the kitchen for an hour over anxiety.  I looked at the list & thought I must be dying but I‚Äôm not dead & if these symptoms were that serious I would be on the floor. It‚Äôs pretty funny to think about now. But when you‚Äôre in the midst of a health anxiety induced panic attack it doesn‚Äôt seem too crazy. Hang in there!
PapaJohns,ffyab4u,t3_evro98,1580341687.0,"I‚Äôm a GM at PJ‚Äôs in Louisiana, they send a new Nutrition Guide to hang up in the store every so often, maybe every month or two. I haven‚Äôt looked at it with a fine tooth comb or anything but I feel like the only reason they would do that is if the ingredients had changed. If I were you I would call the order in when ordering, & ask about the ingredients. If you‚Äôre worried about not receiving your Papa Dough, your receipt should either have a code to redeem points for orders placed over the phone or if the order taker selected the correct name that‚Äôs attached to your account when taking your order it will automatically be added into your account. I know placing the order over the phone is a bit more of a hassle than placing it online but in your case it‚Äôs better safe than sorry!"
gravesdisease,ffxnl4q,t3_evqpmf,1580328773.0,"I am the general manager of a Papa John‚Äôs in Louisiana. I‚Äôm also a tattoo artist. I work 55+ hours per week at PJ‚Äôs alone. It‚Äôs exhausting, as it would be for anyone, not just someone with Graves. It‚Äôs difficult at times to get myself going most days. Lots of fatigue, anxiety/depression.

HealthAnxiety,ffuu4l5,t3_eu2t42,1580249375.0,"I just went to a doctor‚Äôs apt, they did bloodwork but they never called to let me know how it looked. I live in a low income area so any time I go to the doctor, even though I pay full price for insurance & medical treatments, I get treated like a dope head. Most of my problems would probably resolve if I dealt with my thyroid, but the closest endocrinologist is an hour & a half away & it will take months to be seen even with a referral. My doctor didn‚Äôt even try to ask about medications or anything, I feel the healthcare system has failed me on more than one occasion but I‚Äôve also failed myself by not taking care of myself previously & allowing myself to be put in this situation. I made an appointment to see a therapist/psychiatrist on Feb 11th so hopefully they can prescribe me something that will help with this health anxiety. I also have OCD, Bipolar, depression, & PTSD, so I‚Äôm basically just a wreck. Hopefully I can get the care I need soon though."
LSD,f8sku5b,t1_f8qc23g,1574783160.0,"I trip with my boyfriend the majority of the time, tripped by myself once. Tripped with my boyfriend & two other friends one time & didn‚Äôt really enjoy it. I have panic attacks daily & really bad anxiety, so I feel very judged around other people. It was their first time tripping & I basically laid in bed in my room the whole time. My boyfriend had to come tell me to get up bc my friend was having a hard time & it was rude of me to stay to myself when we brought them there to trip together, I just get so overwhelmed that it‚Äôs impossible to enjoy myself unless I‚Äôm just with my boyfriend bc I know he doesn‚Äôt judge me lol. So the thought of being approached by someone who isn‚Äôt tripping while I am is a very scary thought."

Maybe try microdosing lsd, my boyfriend was going to get a strip & some alcohol & put it in a dropper & just take a drop or two on the tongue per day. It‚Äôs supposed to help with all kinds of things. I know my whole world is always so much more clear after a good trip."
LSD,f8eh2dp,t3_e0eoja,1574527476.0,"But how is everyone else able to trip in public? I‚Äôve only ever tripped at my house & locked myself in for fear of someone trying to talk to me & me not making any sense lmfao. I had a bad trip on ecstacy, went outside & my neighbor saw me & I ran back in & started freaking out thinking they were calling the police."
insomnia,f8egcll,t3_e0fkj9,1574527067.0,"I feel you hard. I used to suffer from insomnia for years. A lot of it had to do with my ex husband being the loudest snorer on the face of planet earth. Other things that attributed to it were that I was constantly listening for my son in the other room, as I couldn‚Äôt go to sleep until he was asleep or he would wander the house & get into things. But the biggest reason I think was that I was so disengaged with myself as a person, I really had no idea who I was & what I was doing in life. Mind you, I still am just winging it, just as the rest of you. And I would just lay there & the most intrusive thoughts would surface & I wouldn‚Äôt be able to stuff them back down or make my brain shut off long enough to fall asleep. I would frequently find myself driving to Walmart or Waffle House to kinda try to escape those thoughts. But years later, after getting divorced, filing bankruptcy, moving halfway across the country, & diving into the world of psychedelics, I no longer deal with insomnia. My problems all originally stemmed from my childhood trauma, as my abuse would happen as I was trying to go to sleep every night. So maybe just look deeper into yourself, there‚Äôs always a bigger picture. I was in denial of my problems for the longest time. Of course i would always recommend a good acid trip but that‚Äôs just me lol. Good luck!"

We prep ours in 1/6 lexans, it takes 3 onions to fill a 1/6 lexan. It takes around 5-6 green peppers to fill a 1/6 lexan.

Every now & then we will take our two days off at the end of the week & then the next week take our two days off at the beginning so we take Saturday, Sunday, Monday, & Tuesday off. But last time we did that, we planned on going to New Orleans for one of our former employees‚Äô first shows (he‚Äôs a rapper), but the plans got ruined bc of a hurricane so we spent that time at the house.

How do I know if I‚Äôm just being self destructive or if this is just what being an adult is? No wonder so many people commit suicide if this is all adulthood is man.
