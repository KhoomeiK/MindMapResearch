OCD,fqoyu28,t3_gk4onv,1589529112.0,"It sounds like you’re obsessing about whether or not you have OCD. I like to think of my OCD as “anxiety on steroids” because it is an anxiety disorder. It’s really common with OCD to think you’re faking or be afraid it’s not real, that’s the nature of the disorder it wants you to feed into it and gaslights you. I really encourage you to talk w a professional but know you’re not alone."
OCD,fqor8ub,t3_gk0i2o,1589522521.0,"this is interesting, I’ve always had it to a degree. I’m a big daydreamer and feel like I’m never grounded or in the moment, constantly resorting to escapism. I worry about driving because I’m afraid I’ll drift off into thought. I even every once in a blue moon have a  dissociative episode where I feel like I’m just observing myself and completely detached. I worried I had BPD but don’t meet a lot of the other criteria."
OCD,fqkfznh,t3_gje938,1589426482.0,Yes. The fact you feel discomfort means the thoughts are intrusive. Your mind might have wandered for a moment as minds do and now you feel guilt for not feeling guilty sooner. I don’t want to give you reassurance but this is totally normal and you can easily fall into a thought spiral about these kinds of things with OCD. Thoughts are just thoughts.

OCD,fo5jx9o,t3_g5oheg,1587527467.0,yeah I don’t often think ab somatic things until I see people talk about it and then become hyperaware and afraid I’ll develop it because I had it slightly when I was younger. This sub is a double edged sword bc it offers great support and makes you feel less alone but also can become re assurance seeking and possibly triggering.
OCD,fnyod4b,t1_fnynrql,1587369668.0,"honestly it sounds wild but just stop trying to convince her. She needs to accept that maybe the guy at the store did scam you, and maybe he didn’t and deal with that uncertainty."
OCD,fnyn4xm,t3_g4nqyx,1587368450.0,"I have OCD and also live with a father who has OCD in much different ways than I do. For example every time we use the oven he is convinced we’re going to burn the house down and throws fits, he needs things to be in certain places, is repetitive and meticulous about things etc. and it’s extremely hard to live with. I can probably relate more to the re assurance seeking and making a big deal out of things aspect that your mom has, idk your relationship but would encourage you helping her to get help. Also stop validating her asking for reassurance or certainty, it only provides temporary relief and actually makes the cycle worse at the end of the day."

mentalhealth,fnv4yyj,t3_g3vo04,1587280416.0,"I’ve been working on this with my therapist and while INAD I think setting manageable goals is important. I once had my therapist tell me sometimes just moving from the bed to the couch can be an accomplishment. Sometimes I think we can set ourselves up for failure unintentionally by giving ourselves too many goals and then feeling like failures if we don’t reach them. It can be as simple as wake up, brush teeth, shower, do a hobby. Then you can add on simple and manageable things to it, either way don’t beat yourself up if you miss doing something for a day. It’s definitely harder during quarantining with no set schedules but doing what you can and forgiving yourself for what you can’t does help."

I don’t have bipolar disorder and felt similar but should mention hypomania from anti depressants can be caused by underlying bipolar. Have you considered changing the time of day you take the pill?"
lexapro,fncp5az,t3_g0zju4,1586842788.0,I had something sort of similar with 25 mgs of zoloft where I felt like weirdly good and a bit manic or like I was on adderall in between bouts of anxiety and stopped after only two days bc of it. Started lexapro at a super low dose. Some people are really sensitive to meds and it’s better to try to work your way up.

Some days are better than others but I get caught in bad thought spirals and it’s debilitating, sometimes I can’t get out of bed for hours on end. Got prescribed setraline and only took if for two days bc the nausea and panic it gave me we’re setting me over the edge. I’m not looking very hard for a psychiatrist that does tele appointments since I can’t leave the house to help me with medication management (because I know I need to get on an SSRI but am terrified of the side effects) but it’s extremely hard to find one in network and the out of network ones charge like $500 an hour."

It could be from the 5th grade but my mind reminds me of the embarrassment or guilt I felt and I have to relive it so I totally get where you’re coming from. My OCD usually “chooses” what weirdly specific and upsetting thing I’ll be upset about and then changes from day to day, it’s exhausting.
