YAlit,fnx03vv,t3_g49ech,1587328860.0,Looks great! Your Lunar Chronicles collection is to die for. Especially the new paperbacks; they’re gorgeous!
crescentcitysjm,flz1ibx,t1_flyv3hb,1585613507.0,"I don’t know, I was hoping they’d make some exception for Bryce because the Under King would really want her there or something. It just makes me so sad"
BPD,fjdh1x7,t1_fjd8kkl,1583252621.0,">especially if you’re the one with blatant disorder/mood issues

You’re literally doing what the post is to vent about right now"
throneofglassseries,feb27gn,t3_enzrp1,1578954779.0,This is so stunning! That’s exactly how I imagine her
acotar,f9jfkxo,t1_f9hschv,1575371975.0,"Wait Aelin is short? According to her fan wiki her height is 5’7”-5’8”

throneofglassseries,f097o5f,t3_d3xo7t,1568495495.0,"Yes! At worst, if you’re curious about what happens to the main character by the end of the 8 book series, you can google some spoilers. At best, you decide to read the rest of the books and tell us how you felt about them"
YAlit,eyflyfh,t3_cwtrpa,1567050928.0,Thanks for the recommendation! I’ll certainly check out the audiobooks.
YAlit,eyezbbd,t1_eyeygux,1567041169.0,Thank you!
throneofglassseries,ex1uk3j,t3_cr1l6q,1565956243.0,That looks amazing!! I never saw a map that put all the three continents together like this one
throneofglassseries,evvyqtk,t3_clf17r,1564850799.0,Sadly it’s never mentioned again in the later books. I wish we got to know more about one of his male exes
throneofglassseries,eq6xahi,t3_bxdk3n,1559836971.0,Couldn’t they come up with a more creative idea? Worst thing is that I’m still falling for it. They’ll have my money 😪
throneofglassseries,eq172z6,t1_eq0fznx,1559702530.0,I didn’t hear anything about the TV show other than that it will exist. I think Hulu was more so claiming the copyrights than immediately starting to work on it
throneofglassseries,eq16xpm,t1_epy28uc,1559702437.0,Omg yes her icy aura is perfect for playing Manon
throneofglassseries,eq16ryi,t1_eq0ym4p,1559702342.0,"Completely agree! I was talking only about the looks. Sophie is icy in every way that Aelin is firey, so I don’t see it really working. But who knows? Maybe if she’s a talented actress she can pull it off."
prozac,epwmltx,t3_bwax2w,1559579592.0,"I guess it depends on the dose and how long you’ve been on it. I’m on 80 mg and when I skip a dose I usually break down (emotional instability and sadness, not withdrawal signs), but it could be only because it’s a high dose."
throneofglassseries,epi3ipo,t1_ephu3gx,1559234201.0,"I think so too. There was this scene where Aedion could scent a weird, foreign scent around Lysandra but he couldn’t identify what it was because he never met a shifter before and doesn’t recognize the scent."
scienceofdeduction,epe5t2q,t1_epe4kpf,1559178846.0,Thank you!
scienceofdeduction,epe4fdm,t3_buhsfi,1559178392.0,I can deduce that you have the pastel Jane Austen set of my dreams! May I ask where you got it from?
