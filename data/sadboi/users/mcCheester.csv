TherapeuticKetamine,evkhwct,t3_ck38mw,1564581766.0,"Fellow bipolar here. A few months before I got the ketamine treatments going, I actually went off meds. It was a bad decision, as always. But for that reason, I was on a much lighter dose than usual of Wellbutrin and Abilify, both of which I've taken for years, when I started treatments. I hadn't titrated up very far.

So far my pill pdoc and I have been happy at this level. I'm at 150mg Wellbutrin and 10mg Abilify - about a third of the dosage I was taking before going off meds. One fewer pill too - I used to take effexor as well. What I'm taking seems to keep me stable enough, but the what real improvement I've seen I attribute more to the ketamine. Just had my first booster this week, about six weeks from the end of the initial six treatments. I noticed a difference in my mood right away this time.

I've read that some people can get off the meds altogether with just ketamine, but I'm not at that point yet. I notice if I do miss my meds for a day or two, and it's gross.

Is there a particular med affecting weight for you? I think I read latuda can cause weight gain? Abilify always makes me add a few pounds, but not too much. Ketamine seems to give me a real sweet tooth for a few days after."

Textures and colors were even more brilliant, and as they shifted shapes and came into being and unfolded out of it, I was fully aware that I was drugged, yet I was awake enough to try to guide myself through what I felt was the Shared Consciousness, that might lead me to my Mom, so I could try to help her somehow.

&#x200B;

Mom had back surgery the other day, while I was having my 3rd treatment. Despite going into it with bad mobility and much pain, she came out with worse mobility and worse pain. I guess I thought I could somehow help with that in my non-corporeal state. I don't know that I had any effect, but my blood pressure did go quite high, so they had me stay later post-treatment than usual. It went down again once I twisted myself awake. I think I reached my max ketamine levels, I was really fucking tripping.

&#x200B;

At the last second I opted to listen to Twin Peaks S3 soundtrack, damn that NIN song hits hard. Probably not for everyone. I liked surfing it though. And all the others.

&#x200B;

If I have any worries about this treatment, it's that it will become a habit, or I'll go for street versions and snort it. omg I like it so much. That's a distinct possibility, I won't lie.

&#x200B;

More on Thursday.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I buried the lede. I'm feeling better! Really. My mood is good (confirmed by my spouse), my energy's up. This weekend I mowed the lawn and washed my car and went out to breakfast all in the same day and wasn't exhausted. That's new.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Day 11, infusion 5. aka Jankiest Trip Ever.

&#x200B;

The setup was fine, great nurse & doc, same dose as two days ago. Admittedly though, I went into it in a bad frame of mind. Cranky, impatient, up too early (had to leave for the appt at 6:30am). And, whereas the other four times there were no other people in the room of med bays, this time it was packed full, probably ten beds. So there were sounds of talking and equipment beeping constantly, and it kept drawing me out of any flow I got going in the trip.

&#x200B;

I strongly recommend noise-cancelling headphones for this treatment, and I am definitely bringing mine for my next and final time.

&#x200B;

So yeah it was a constant jerking from barely getting to the ever-expanding awesomeness of my last experiences, to feeling acutely awake. I remember wondering if something was pinching off the IV at times preventing the drug from flowing. I had to change my music two times. Stared out with Boards of Canada, but that was too detached, so I managed to flip to Kate Bush's 'Aerial' again. Then I was aware enough to even get the nurse to switch again when my fingers were clumsy. She changed me to Jane Siberry 'When I Was A Boy' and I skimmed across that like a rock on water, skipping into the water and then out, like a stone. Then it was done.

&#x200B;

I'm not as keen at trying the home game now that I know it could border on the unpleasant. That's probably good.

&#x200B;

I am preparing for my final trip this cycle. I'm going to try to bring myself back to a point I remember before I was falling apart from my disorder... approx 1983 when I was in high school, and night school, working almost full time, socializing normally too. I'm making a playlist of songs that meant something to me then but also fit with the drug. I will wear noise cancelling headphones and see how far I can get in an attempt to feel like that 35 years later.

&#x200B;

I am still feeling better. I'm pretty sure. It's been so long since I touched normal that it's hard to tell. But I can say that, unlike much of my life, I don't feel like my brain is trying to kill me at the moment. I don't feel constant waves of shame over the smallest forgotten (by all but me) incidents from years ago, that I think of randomly and probably weren't that bad in the first place. I definitely lost the ""you suck"" and ""kill yourself"" voices. The energy is slightly up; I'd like a bit more boost there. Let's hope it lasts.

&#x200B;

More next time, Monday the third. Cheers-

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

And the cycle is done. I had infusion #6 of 6 this morning.

&#x200B;

It was a bit quieter this time, thankfully, but I brought the noise cancelling headphones, so I used them. I put together a playlist of 80s songs, specifically songs I remember rocking out to in my room when I was 15 or 16, before the depression and bipolar took hold. Devo, B-52's, Joan Jett, Rush - the two standouts this trip were Pink Floyd ""Pigs (Three Different Ones)"" and The Waitresses ""Jimmy Tomorrow"". I'm not seeing human forms on these trips, or really any recognizable figures or landscapes, but the emotions are there and real. And I did manage to capture short bursts of that openness and optimism of youth. I was aware where I was and that this was my last time, and made a conscious effort to bring back from the trip some of that feeling.

&#x200B;

I am feeling good. I'd say it's been at least a year since I felt this calm and clear and relatively happy. I still have some bad habits I need to work around (I'm kinda lazy even when I'm not depressed) but if I can get past them and start exercising more and taking better care of my surroundings, I'll be in a pretty good place. And whereas three weeks ago I also knew I should exercise and clean more, I feel like I have the energy and ability to do it now. Then it was just another thing I'd not do and then feel shitty about because I'm the worst. Now I think I have the clarity and desire to at least start moving in that direction, but without berating myself if it goes slowly.

&#x200B;

Those jeering, negative, intrusive thoughts of how much I suck and fail and deserve nothing don't really seem to be around now. I was having some real issues adjusting to a recent weight gain; now I'm feeling more comfortable being the size I am. I'd like to lose some, but I'm not beating myself up psychically over it anymore. I don't find myself randomly shouting ""Fuck You"" at myself. And my, er, lbido is picking up.

&#x200B;

Someone asked me about cost, and I didn't know then. Now I do. The cost that the insurance company ultimately pays is something like $1400 a treatment. I'm on the hook for a deductible of $1000 initially, then a small part of each treatment, about $145/ea. So this'll run about $1800-$2000 out of my pocket for the six treatments. Yep, it's expensive, and I'm grateful to be in a position to do it.

&#x200B;

For more info I recommend going to r/TherapeuticKetamine \- interesting community with a lot of info.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading, that wraps it up. Cheers-"
BipolarReddit,epwwksg,t3_bwe245,1559586430.0,"I have to say, I liked the ketamine. It was a little unnerving at first being hooked to the machines - they have your IV in, plus a blood pressure cuff, a pulse clip on your finger, and a few sensors on the chest to monitor vitals - but they were pretty good about seeing that I was comfortable. The doc came down once I was set up and started me off.

&#x200B;

My choice of music was spot on. Kate Bush's ""Aerial"" was made for ketamine. Sounds like it could even have been made \*on\* ketamine. Thanks for the other music suggestions in the comments. I downloaded Boards of Canada for next time, and I don't have Spotify now, but I'll see if I can get a free trial so I can hear that playlist as well. Still checking out the other suggestions.

&#x200B;

During the procedure I was still very clear on who/where I was. I knew for the most part what was going on around me, but I faded back from it, got lost in the textures and the movements and the layers of the music. Mostly I kept my eyes closed - lids were pretty heavy, and my focus wasn't great. Also, although the main thought-line in my head seemed clear, my body felt like a big wobbly marshmallow when I tried to move even a bit. At one point I had a nice little reverie about being an astronaut floating into space. One of many swirling half-thoughts as the hour passed (although I had little concept of time). I remember at the end feeling like a candle that had been melted into a puddle of wax.

&#x200B;

The doc came around after the procedure again to check on me. It seemed like they were satisfied with my reaction, so we're a go for another one in two days. As for whether I feel any ""better"", maybe a little. I feel more hopeful that this might work. Worst case scenario, I'll have half a dozen nice drug experiences. But I guess it'll still be a while before I know. I'll post something in this thread after each treatment to keep you apprised.

&#x200B;

Again, thanks for all the well-wishes.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I had my 2nd treatment this afternoon. I guess I'll add my updates about them here, underneath the description of the first treatment. I will do my best to update every time. When I was researching doing this, it was rare to find a treatment cycle description that didn't fall off after one or two entries... I would've liked more complete tales, so I'll try to provide one.

&#x200B;

Because I responded well to the first treatment, this time the doc upped the ketamine dose. He says amounts at the higher end of the range often work best; he's trying to find the most therapeutic dose for me, starting lower and increasing as/if needed. No surprise to me I needed a bump - I'm a giant person. Also this time, in addition to a blood pressure cuff, pulse clip, and chest sensors, I was hooked up to a low-level oxygen feed through one of those nose tubes. I made a lame Locutus of Borg joke as they were decking me out, fortunately the nurse didn't get it.

&#x200B;

The intensity of the psychedelic brainshow was increased this time - although  less traditionally psychedelic, more a stream of dream-like interstitials stitched together and gliding diagonally. However, it seemed a shorter experience than the first one. Time perception on ketamine is shit though.

&#x200B;

Made my own playlist for today. Best received by my flying mind were David Bowie's ""Blackstar"" and Sidney Gish's ""Sin Triangle"".

&#x200B;

In two days we go again, and again with a higher dose. I'll stop here and write a few notes afterward. Cheers-

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Third treatment today.

&#x200B;

Going into it, I am already seeing positive signs that may be (? or may not, but probably are) attributable to the ketamine. My mood seems a little lighter, I have a bit more energy, there's less static in my head, like my brain moved to a quieter street. Also, in a couple of recent conversations I noticed I was finding my words a little easier, it wasn't a struggle to locate the right ones, like it has been for a while. Mind you, these are not huge changes so far, but they have me optimistic.

&#x200B;

Nothing new about the setup this time. Forms and tubes. The doc bumped up the dose again. My music choice was a lead-in of ""Blackstar"" and ""Lazarus"" (again), then ""Twin Peaks: Music From The Limited Event Series"". Good choices, I must say. The ""trip"" was again a bit more intense, but in no way unpleasant, like a really intense dream of otherworldly landscapes that you can't quite remember fully.

&#x200B;

I'm K-free for the next three days, but I'll pop in with notes from my next session on Tuesday."

Mom had back surgery the other day, while I was having my 3rd treatment. Despite going into it with bad mobility and much pain, she came out with worse mobility and worse pain. I guess I thought I could somehow help with that in my non-corporeal state. I don't know that I had any effect, but my blood pressure did go quite high, so they had me stay later post-treatment than usual. It went down again once I twisted myself awake. I think I reached my max ketamine levels, I was really fucking tripping.

&#x200B;

At the last second I opted to listen to Twin Peaks S3 soundtrack, damn that NIN song hits hard. Probably not for everyone. I liked surfing it though. And all the others.

&#x200B;

If I have any worries about this treatment, it's that it will become a habit, or I'll go for street versions and snort it. omg I like it so much. That's a distinct possibility, I won't lie.

&#x200B;

More on Thursday.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I buried the lede. I'm feeling better! Really. My mood is good (confirmed by my spouse), my energy's up. This weekend I mowed the lawn and washed my car and went out to breakfast all in the same day and wasn't exhausted. That's new.

&#x200B;

Two more treatments left."
BipolarReddit,eonzlxj,t1_eoh2lhy,1558725531.0,"Third treatment today.

&#x200B;

Going into it, I am already seeing positive signs that may be (? or may not, but probably are) attributable to the ketamine. My mood seems a little lighter, I have a bit more energy, there's less static in my head, like my brain moved to a quieter street. Also, in a couple of recent conversations I noticed I was finding my words a little easier, it wasn't a struggle to locate the right ones, like it has been for a while. Mind you, these are not huge changes so far, but they have me optimistic.

&#x200B;

Nothing new about the setup this time. Forms and tubes. The doc bumped up the dose again. My music choice was a lead-in of ""Blackstar"" and ""Lazarus"" (again), then ""Twin Peaks: Music From The Limited Event Series"". Good choices, I must say. The ""trip"" was again a bit more intense, but in no way unpleasant, like a really intense dream of otherworldly landscapes that you can't quite remember fully.

&#x200B;

I'm K-free for the next three days, but I'll pop in with notes from my next session on Tuesday."
BipolarReddit,eoh2lhy,t1_eo9esyp,1558571400.0,"I had my 2nd treatment this afternoon. I guess I'll add my updates about them here, underneath the description of the first treatment. I will do my best to update every time. When I was researching doing this, it was rare to find a treatment cycle description that didn't fall off after one or two entries... I would've liked more complete tales, so I'll try to provide one.

&#x200B;

Because I responded well to the first treatment, this time the doc upped the ketamine dose. He says amounts at the higher end of the range often work best; he's trying to find the most therapeutic dose for me, starting lower and increasing as/if needed. No surprise to me I needed a bump - I'm a giant person. Also this time, in addition to a blood pressure cuff, pulse clip, and chest sensors, I was hooked up to a low-level oxygen feed through one of those nose tubes. I made a lame Locutus of Borg joke as they were decking me out, fortunately the nurse didn't get it.

&#x200B;

The intensity of the psychedelic brainshow was increased this time - although  less psychedelic maybe than a stream of darker dream-like interstitials stitched together and gliding diagonally. However, it seemed a shorter experience than the first one. Time perception on ketamine is shit though.

&#x200B;

Made my own playlist for today. Best received by my flying mind were David Bowie's ""Blackstar"" and Sidney Gish's ""Sin Triangle"".

&#x200B;

In two days we go again, and again with a higher dose. I'll stop here and write a few notes afterward. Cheers-"
BipolarReddit,eo9fy25,t1_eo97xlu,1558390466.0,"I contacted a clinic that does ketamine on the web (found them through googling). They called and got some basic information. I sent them a copy of my insurance card and they did the checking on whether the insurance would pay for treatments. I might have to pay a deductible or something, not entirely sure yet, but most if not all of it is covered.

&#x200B;

They did want to know my doctor's name, and wanted a referral from my pdoc. I met with my pdoc during this and told him I was looking into it, and he agreed to write a referral. I think later the ketamine clinic contacted him for additional info but not sure what.

&#x200B;

There were a bunch of introductory forms too that the doctor provided. Once I finished them, got my referral, and had my insurance cleared by their billing, it took about a week to hear back. Then I had to schedule a new patient appointment for gathering health info and explaining the treatment process to me. Then, finally, I could start.

&#x200B;

They make you jump through a few hoops but if it works obv it's worth it. Good luck."
BipolarReddit,eo9esyp,t3_bqugr7,1558389689.0,"Wow, a lot of great replies here. Thank you to every one who responded.

&#x200B;

I have to say, I liked the ketamine. It was a little unnerving at first being hooked to the machines  - they have your IV in, plus a blood pressure cuff, a pulse clip on your finger, and a few sensors on the chest to monitor vitals - but they were pretty good about seeing that I was comfortable. The doc came down once I was set up and started me off.

&#x200B;

My choice of music was spot on. Kate Bush's ""Aerial"" was made for ketamine. Sounds like it could even have been made \*on\* ketamine. Thanks for the other music suggestions in the comments. I downloaded Boards of Canada for next time, and I don't have Spotify now, but I'll see if I can get a free trial so I can hear that playlist as well. Still checking out the other suggestions.

&#x200B;

During the procedure I was still very clear on who/where I was. I knew for the most part what was going on around me, but I faded back from it, got lost in the textures and the movements and the layers of the music. Mostly I kept my eyes closed - lids were pretty heavy, and my focus wasn't great. Also, although the main thought-line in my head seemed clear, my body felt like a big wobbly marshmallow when I tried to move even a bit. At one point I had a nice little reverie about being an astronaut floating into space. One of many swirling half-thoughts as the hour passed (although I had little concept of time). I remember at the end feeling like a candle that had been melted into a puddle of wax.

&#x200B;

The doc came around after the procedure again to check on me. It seemed like they were satisfied with my reaction, so we're a go for another one in two days. As for whether I feel any ""better"", maybe a little. I feel more hopeful that this might work. Worst case scenario, I'll have half a dozen nice drug experiences. But I guess it'll still be a while before I know. I'll post something in this thread after each treatment to keep you apprised.

&#x200B;

Again, thanks for all the well-wishes."
