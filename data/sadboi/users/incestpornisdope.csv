BokuNoHeroAcademia,fc91god,t1_fc90n5w,1577545486.0,"Are really about to sit here and call my hero academia a ‚Äúhappy go lucky Sh≈çnen‚Äù when let‚Äôs go down the list.
1.Shigaraki mistakenly murdered his whole family
2.Endeavor allegedly killing his own son.
3.Shigaraki destroying a whole city (along with everyone) in it with one touch
4.The constant torture of a innocent girl (eri)
While it can‚Äôt compare to Sh≈çnen like beserk in terms of darkness, I can‚Äôt help but think that ‚Äúhappy go lucky‚Äù is an understatement. While the series started off light hearted, after the stain arc it seems as though horikoshi has made a point in gradually making the series darker. While it‚Äôs not a super edgy and depressing Sh≈çnen it is also not super happy go lucky like fairy tail."
