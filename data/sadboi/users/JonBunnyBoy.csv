He had been taking ""M-Cat"" and became convinced he needed to jump to prevent Holly Willoughby from going to Hell. I guess he must've really liked her at that time."

schizophrenia,f75qnze,t3_dubv2f,1573418087.0,"I drank and got drunk regularly for years, and then after my first psychotic break alcohol completely stopped ""working'.

Thinking back, I guess I was already put on olanzapine by the time booze stopped affecting me, so I don't know whether it was the meds or the breakdown itself that changed things.

I haven't drank in years now, not even to test the waters, as I had a big drinking problem before the breakdown, and I'm doing ok without it so I see no point drinking again as it will either not work or I'll get addicted again"
