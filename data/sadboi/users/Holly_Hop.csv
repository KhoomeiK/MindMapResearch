schizophrenia,fji5kjz,t3_fdkxm4,1583360974.0,I've always struggled with a monotone voice so this isn't news to me. But it's hard to match someone's elese levels of excitement. A voice can be trained to be nonmonotone. Which I sorta did. Expressions are harder now though with emotions being on the weird side.

schizoaffective,fjfospl,t3_fcvdxw,1583296411.0,"A lot of people are suggesting vraylar. Which I am also on. It is really good. But depending on insurance (if in USA) it takes a second to get it authorized.

What my Psychiatrist did was taper me off of previous med while tapering me up on vraylar. Didn't go too wild when it happened.

Only side effect of vraylar is sweating at night when I sleep. But no weight gain on it. I'm actually losing weight working out and all I do is eat vegaterian and walk like 30mins a day."
schizophrenia,fjfl585,t3_fd6of8,1583294068.0,"For me it started more in college. But high school had obvious symptoms. Basically I was scared that monsters were on the campus trying to kill me. So I never walked outside at night as a gut reaction. Eventually it stopped for a little bit. Then I dropped out of college to live with my best friend from college. He highly believed in the occult. My schizophrenia flared up again around him saying x, y, z where related to supernatural creatures and I 100% believed him. Being delusional it made sense. Eventually I started seeing monsters all around me under human skin. So basically people had and aura around them that signified they were monsters. So it was a distressing time. With meds I don't see things anymore but I have extreme paranoia that they are still out there ready to kill me. Especially at night."
