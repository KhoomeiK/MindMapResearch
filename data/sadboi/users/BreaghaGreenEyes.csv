TheGlowUp,f4q64fy,t3_dlce38,1571748541.0,"More mascara. Its the one thing I'd take on a desert island. My favorite is Loreal Luminous Miss Manga. Loreal  Lash Paradise is famous in the beauty community. 

As a fellow former wearer of t-shirts, save those for bed. Find form fitting tops. I left giant t-shirts behind in middle school and suddenly started looking more girly. 

Most importantly, have fun and find things you like =]"
MedicalGore,f4q53xx,t3_dl5ybd,1571748094.0, Do you have a picture of what the mole looked like before? I think that is the most important part to share! My dad died from malignant melanoma. I'm sending good thoughts into the universe for your friend.

BPD,f02bavu,t3_d39zkr,1568327178.0,"I've found the best way to do job stuff is spontaneously. Otherwise my fears and insecurities win. I'm a pretty likable person without all the pressure. If I can do things in the moment it's not as scary. 

Congrats to you! I'm job hunting and you just gave me a sprinkle of confidence."
BPD,ezkkth3,t3_d14619,1567961987.0,Nope. Only myself. I think this is one of the biggest bpd misconceptions perpetrated by the media.
BPD,ey3skjm,t3_cv5bwd,1566772613.0,I've done this too. I chopped off my waist long hair into a pixie cut. I love my hair and it definitely felt like I was punishing myself. Sitting here now with ways long hair again. It seems something a lot of us do. Glad you're still around.
BPD,exgwbif,t3_csi4sk,1566278245.0,"I cannot stand people walking back and forth on a creaky floor a zillion times a day, opening and closing four doors every time such makes three little dogs all bark. PHEW. This house!

People talking loudly on the phone all day. Walking up and down stairs. Loud music or loud voices. 

I have to have quiet or a boil inside myself until I have to get up and walk it off. I get so annoyed and I can't help it."
BPD,exg1qtc,t1_exe1yu6,1566253476.0,"I was in the emergency room over night for the same thing. Luckily I did it on my Friday and had two days to cope. Heck no I didn't tell anyone. I cut my wrist and hid the bandage and stiches with long shirts. After that I hid the wound/scar with long shirts. I worked inside a pharmacy and had to wash my hands frequently. I was very careful about no one seeing, but one day I forgot. Thankfully the person who saw was the coolest and closest coworker there. I don't think she kept it a secret tho. 

I had to get an ADA note in order to keep my work schedule the same. It was bullying and bullshit. They (manager and coworkers) thought I was bullshiting and making excuses. Welp, I got that note and it pissed them off even more. 

My biggest mistake was confiding about my soulmate's suicide. It's such a small work environment that you feel close. Or you WANT to feel close. One day an especially bullying coworker was being an extra bitch on the anniversary of my soulmate's suicide and I told her I couldn't deal with her today. She responded that I used his suicide as an excuse for everything. 

I walked out that day and never went back. This happened in a Wal-Mart pharmacy. I wouldn't wish that bullying on anyone. They're not supposed to judge you by your mental illness but they will. 

Sorry this is so long. I feel strongly about this and don't want it to happen to someone else. I haven't worked in 5 years and thinking about it gives me panic attacks. It's not worth your health. Your boss and coworkers don't need to know anything. It's the frickin LAW. Please look into The Americans with Disability Act."
DelphiMurders,exd5m3b,t3_crthc6,1566167824.0,Stephanie Harlowe introduced me to the case. She is very in-depth and sensitive to the feelings of the family.
BPD,exd51fn,t3_cs391i,1566167409.0," From my experience, don't tell your boss. Never ever. Don't tell coworkers unless it's someone you have a real relationship with outside of work. I made that mistake and it will give people a reason to belittle you. It's really horrible to trust someone only to have that person gossip behind your back. 

You even have to be careful with family and friends. I only tell people who have a mental illness as well. I find that ""normal"" people just don't get it."
BPD,exd4awj,t3_cs2yic,1566166889.0,"I get crushes super easily. I can have zero interest in a guy, but if he pays attention to me I'm in love. Imagining babies and our house. Then someone else comes along, pays attention to me... I used to have a whole collection, but that's stopped. 

I didn't actually date them, kiss them, sleep with them, nothing. Just talked, texted, flirted. As soon as they wanted more I started to drift away.

My advice is to stay off social media. I can handle Instagram, but def not Facebook. Also don't text the person or message them. Make any interaction a TRUE REAL face to face interaction."
