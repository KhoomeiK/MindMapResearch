This doesn't mean happiness, god knows how hard happiness is to achieve, but it gives you a good support system."

I'm not sure about your knowledge of US Govern. But there is the Senate, who is chosen by the president, and the House of Representatives chosen by the people. The House voted to Impeach Trump. Senate, being mostly Republican (for Trump) will most likely vote to keep him in.

Again, my bad if the info is off."

Support from the internet. I realised how much I needed love and affection (not romantically but from family). I love my parents to bits, they seem like they love me too, but theres a still a hint of hurt and pain behind the ""I love you"". My social media platforms were overwhelmed with support and care from strangers who have no idea who I am. I know it gets better, im betting on it, but right now thats all I needed."
