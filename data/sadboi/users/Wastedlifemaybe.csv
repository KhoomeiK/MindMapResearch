therapy,fa219uq,t3_e7f6i8,1575776676.0,"I am genuinely asking. Have you thought about magic mushrooms at all? I felt happy for the first time in awhile. Even after the trip was over, after 4-5 hours, I felt tremendously positive for quite some time after.

regret,f81rn46,t3_dyf9uf,1574175739.0,"I hear you. I can relate in my own way. All my decisions have been made for others for fear of being labeled selfish, but I'm miserable. I'm trapped in a life I realized too late I didn't want. I can't without making it worse for my family. A doormat forever.
