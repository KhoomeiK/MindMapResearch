playstation,fqc3wna,t1_fqbed78,1589249594.0,"I‚Äôm assuming by damage they‚Äôre referring to obvious component damage. Breaking the seal isn‚Äôt damaging the system, its simply removing a sticker. The new rules are simply stating that Sony can‚Äôt void a warranty because you removed the sticker and opened the machine.

Now, if you remove the sticker, open it up and smash the insides with a hammer, that‚Äôs obviously not something Sony is going to cover. Throw it down the stairs, no warranty. But removing the sticker, opening your system to clean it and putting it back together with zero damage done no longer can be considered a ‚Äúwarranty void‚Äù. 

I‚Äôll add quickly this isn‚Äôt a Sony thing, this is the FTC saying to all electronics makers that removing stickers isn‚Äôt enough to void a warranty. It‚Äôs been a shady practice for years and a way for electronics makers to shaft you out of free repairs they owe you within the warranty period."

Just wanted to say I hope the console version is a success, we ALL would love to see the dlc come to console, and me personally, a psvr version become a reality.
