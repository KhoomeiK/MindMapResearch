BPD,fln26rt,t1_flkum6b,1585306363.0,"I feel really bad sometimes that maybe I lack empathy sometimes when I see something that I may or may not have caused. Then I remind myself that I am overly emphatic most of the time, up to the point of people pleasing, and that pretty much everyone else in the world do things that disregard empathy all the time yet for them they are rewarded. (I.e CEO’s, politicians) It honestly feels like the world is so foreign sometimes and that it was built for other people around me."
BPD,fln188x,t1_flm7xtm,1585305269.0,"I feel like I can relate to this a lot. A lot of the time I have feeling and thoughts build up inside me, and even scare the hell out of me sometimes, but the fear that people will misunderstand and simply label me as crazy is crushingly overwhelming. Over the last year I’ve come more to terms with my need to repress most of these feelings, so that the others around me feel comfortable. Im hoping someday, maybe somebody who really cares and has been through something similar will find me and we could help each other get through life. But just like most things that I look forward to, it’s just seems like a fantasy."
BPD,fln097g,t1_flllt06,1585304138.0,"Honestly felt this same way when I was baker acted about a year ago. To be honest life has been pretty downhill from there. I know am in pain, I just don’t think I deserve to get help, everybody’s kinda always gave off the vibe that they hate my expression of negative emotions. I didn’t know any other way so now I’m stuck with never expressing my negative feelings, only living in a hell trapped and alone in my head. It’s scary to think that society’s will is strong enough to completely immobilize me in my mind."
