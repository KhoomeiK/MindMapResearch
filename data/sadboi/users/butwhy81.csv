Why are you working so hard to provide for someone you don‚Äôt live with, aren‚Äôt engaged to, and are not married to? That‚Äôs the real question. I‚Äôm not sure how other relationships work-but I can‚Äôt wrap my head around why someone you‚Äôre dating would pay for you to take yoga classes and explore the city while they worked all day. 
Aside from all that she sounds super lazy, entitled and disrespectful. 
The only credit I can give her is that I get the boredom and the weed smoking at noon. I‚Äôm not working and have been under quarantine for two months, I am definitely starting to go crazy. I‚Äôm bored, sleeping at completely intervals and times, smoking weed, experiencing debilitating anxiety. Basically feeling like my brain turned upside down. So perhaps her recent laziness is new as a result of quarantine? 
Regardless-she needs to respect your work hours and quiet time. If she doesn‚Äôt she can leave end of story. 
Also NTA for saying it‚Äôs not her house. It‚Äôs 100% not and you guys don‚Äôt live together. Also why is this even being said? So if it were her house she could be loud disruptive and interrupt you all day long? How is that rational or make any sense. The fact that she used that as some sort of defense is ludicrous.

His mentality that YOUR virginity is a thing for someone to take from you is disgusting. The fact that he‚Äôs mad that he didn‚Äôt get to take it is not only gross but extremely controlling. Someone who thinks like this is never going to treat you like an equal. (I say ‚Äúnever‚Äù, but I mean without intense reprogramming, self evaluation etc) 
If I could go back and tell my younger self anything about relationships it would be this-
Never ever ever allow anyone to make you feel bad about who you are, where you come from, or where you are going. That is NOT love. I know that we make excuses for people we love and it can be hard to see clearly, but I spent so much energy feeing shame and guilt because I allowed someone I loved to make me feel bad about my choices.

If she contacts you again record the conversation. 
Document with date and time (back up with any text/email conversations) of each harassment. 
Contact HR immediately. Absolutely DO NOT wait. As someone pointed out, this is sexual harassment.

Stop talking to anyone other than HR or managers about this. I know you want to discuss it, hear what she‚Äôs saying etc and it‚Äôs validating time have people take your side.

Yes! Report it to the media!!! Out all these racist assholes 100%!! Good idea!"
AskHR,fkt2j50,t3_fkf3fv,1584504451.0,"This is disgusting behavior and I‚Äôm sorry you are dealing with this. My advice:

Tell them to shut the fuck up next time they start. Obviously be more diplomatic and smart, but shutting it down the second it starts is step one. 

Document EVERYTHING. Every comment, every laugh, every snicker, each person, the time of day-every single time it happens. 

Report this ASAP. If you don‚Äôt have HR to report to, talk to your manager/supervisor/owner etc. If they are a part of this, I am truly sorry. You can report to the department of labor and the EEOC office as well. Which I HIGHLY recommend doing. 

Look for another job. Obviously during this pandemic you are going to have a hard time doing this, but start now. 

Again very sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this bullshit on top of everything already going on. These people are scum, I hope you can report them to HR and get them all fired! Racism is never ever under any circumstance funny or ok."

AskHR,fk5hdnf,t1_fk5aozr,1583880529.0,This is so important! Taking detailed documentation each and every time it happens will make it much easier to prove if it does escalate further.

AskHR,fk52uvy,t3_fgevwn,1583872403.0,I just experienced a very similar situation. You are able to legally ask for accommodations like working from home. They don‚Äôt have to accommodate in which case you may be eligible for a severance package and unemployment. Is this a job that can be done remotely? Also you may be eligible for state disability depending on where you live.

BreakUps,fjzm5q6,t1_fjxsebo,1583723056.0,Sometimes they do come back. With all the things you want to hear-and all the problems you had before. It still won‚Äôt work and you‚Äôll be heartbroken all over again. Best to accept it and move on. Try not to think about it like ‚Äúbeing a good person‚Äù. Try to think about like you just weren‚Äôt a match. There is someone out there who is a better match. In time you will see all the ways they weren‚Äôt right for you and a better relationship will come along.
AmItheAsshole,fjzlve4,t3_ffivtc,1583722846.0,YTA 100%. Who are you to tell her what will or won‚Äôt help? She‚Äôs on medication so she must be cured? Have you lost a parent? Have you suffered depression? Do you know what it‚Äôs like to live in her head everyday? Have some empathy. And honestly it‚Äôs super weird that you are concerned with people being uncomfortable while visiting. She‚Äôs right to break up with you.

BreakUps,fjo49l6,t1_fjmzqtm,1583520218.0,I don‚Äôt think I am saying that I or anyone else ‚Äúneeds‚Äù a partner. I was pointing out that my intense frantic loneliness is coming from a place of missing a romantic partner in my life and there is nothing to fill that space. Have to be comfortable with the emptiness and loneliness.

I didn‚Äôt come out until much later, but I always wonder what a different person I would be if I had been in a supportive environment. I recommend getting her out of that school ASAP. Regardless of if she ends being more fluid, she is obviously already thinking about it and needs to be in a supportive environment. The deep rooted pathologies that come from being forced into the closet are horrible. Give this kid a chance to have a normal life.

This guy is 100% an asshole. I can‚Äôt even imagine the prejudice, racism, and xenophobia it would take to insist that someone stop eating food they preferred. My ex is Mexican and grew up eating spicy food, I am white and my pallet can‚Äôt tolerate it. When we cooked together she would just add the heat to her portion and I never once got offended when she poured black pepper all over food I cooked. In fact I would pepper her portion when I served her. This is ridiculous. Don‚Äôt take this bullshit. I can absolutely see his controlling nature becoming a major problem down the line."

This seems super manipulative. If he had come to you and told you he wants to work less or earn zero income to focus on his art you could have made an informed decision. Instead he manipulated you into doing something you didn‚Äôt want to do. I absolutely under no circumstances would agree to an hour walk everyday! That‚Äôs just insane. He is 100% gaslighting you by calling you lazy. Honestly I agree with others-it may be time to get out. It sounds a bit like he wants to be a child, not working, living with his parents etc. 
To be fair I am also an artist and I would absolutely love to be able to pay no rent, work an internship, and build my portfolio. But I would never under any circumstances force my partner into supporting that financially. 
I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre going through this, but it might be time to reconsider the relationship."

Also, you are gaining valuable experience in your field and earning an income. Who cares if it lasts 3 months or 3 years? I understand wanting something permanent, but focus on the experience you‚Äôre getting now. Who knows what kind of connections you‚Äôll make, what doors it will open. Lastly, it is easier to find a job when you have a job, so update your LinkedIn, keep the door open for other jobs, and learn as much as you can."
gabapentin,fjcdgbr,t3_fcpyrk,1583216000.0,"The direct answer is that yes if you take more than prescribed-and take the max dose you will feel something. I, however would question why you are trying to take more than prescribed and what it is that you are trying to escape. The easy answer is that yes-if you take more than you need you will feel slight euphoria and body relaxation. If you are taking gabapentin for an actual medical reason I can‚Äôt really get on board with taking more than prescribed. Are you trying to get high or are you trying to treat what the medication was prescribed for?"

AskAstrologers,fjbu375,t1_fjbt82k,1583201440.0,A lot of what you are saying does reflect my ex. But she does have Leo rising so perhaps that was the issue. She definitely makes me feel like my world is growing and brings so much fire to my life. It was recently pointed out by a friend that in social settings she is very clingy and doesn‚Äôt like me talking to other people. I interpret this as the behavior of someone who will never let me shine.
