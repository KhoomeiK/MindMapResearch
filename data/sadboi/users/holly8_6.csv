therapy,fpsr1h1,t1_fpspnhn,1588878156.0,"Thank you!  I will ask my psychologist if she could talk to my psychiatrist.  The reason we went to psychiatrist #2 is because #1‚Äôs diagnosis didn‚Äôt make any sense.  I think I may just be scared that the doctor doesn‚Äôt believe me.  I am doing a dialectic behaviour therapy workbook and will join a group when covid is over.  I am terrified to be unmedicated because I know how low I get without any meds, it is scary.  I just with I could control this situation."

bipolar,fpsmbuo,t1_fpsk0on,1588875892.0,It sucks because #3 is who I am assigned to.
bipolar,fpsjsb8,t1_fpsjeii,1588874655.0,That‚Äôs what I keep saying but I have to see psychiatrist 3 as he is the only one accepting patients.  He has convinced my doctor too.  I am unable to get another psychiatrist without a referral from my doctor.  I asked if I could pay a 4th psychiatrist to figure it out and follow me but my family doc said that we can‚Äôt because healthcare is public in Canada.

bipolar,fopg9sm,t3_g8rr7n,1587960715.0,Omg!  This is a thing!  This explains so much.  I recently had this happen to me but never framed it as a hypo mania before.  It makes a lot of sense now how I continue to be social awkward and over share when I really didn‚Äôt want to do it.  During it is fine or funny a few days later it is hide your face humiliating.

You only need to make it through today and if that is too much then just make it through this hour and if that is too much make it though the next minute.  You are strong.  You will have setbacks in your life but continue to take small steps forward.  You are worth it and everything is going to be ok. I believe in you!

bipolar2,fn1osb4,t3_fxwc58,1586566651.0,"Last night I took my first dose and I literally slept from 10pm to 7:30 am then had 2 morning naps while I tried to function which were an hour each.  Then went down for a real nap at 12:30pm and slept until 3pm.  Then fell asleep in my chair again at 4:00pm for 30 min.  I feel fine now as it has wore off again but it is almost time for my next dose! 

Edit:  I take it for BPD"

mentalhealth,fma4fkf,t1_fm9xu9g,1585883567.0,I have shown symptoms on and off with varying severity for 20 years.  I have been loosely seeking a diagnosis and a plan for about 12 years.  I have been actively trying to get a diagnosis and treatment plan for the last 4 years.  I only was dealt with more seriously after I met with my psychologist when I was at the bottom of a low.  So a really really long time!
bipolar,fm9c08h,t1_fm94yei,1585865673.0,When you think this will be the rest of your life bouncing between considering driving my car off the bridge and being so excited I am shaking. I am glad to know that there may be some relief in sight even for a few days.  I am not excited about being mentally ill.  I am excited that we have deciphered that there is an issue and we will be treating it accordingly.  The treatment may not be great but I have been dealing with this unmedicated for as long as I can remember so some directions for me is amazing.
mentalhealth,fm9bmwu,t1_fm981gf,1585865463.0,You too!  It is nice to know that this isn‚Äôt just what everyone is going through and I just can‚Äôt hack it.
mentalhealth,fm9034m,t1_fm8ze3t,1585859193.0,I don‚Äôt know if excited is the word I would use.  I am more relieved that this isn‚Äôt what everyone is going through and I am just unable to cope.  I am excited not about the diagnosis but about managing this as having psychotic breaks and not knowing what is real is extremely terrifying for me. I know thing won‚Äôt be perfect going forward but if we can quiet down the crazy in my head it would be ideal.

progresspics,flxwnzq,t1_flxwdf4,1585591237.0,Thanks for the support!  I started doing weight watchers which has been insanely helpful.  The social distancing has meant that we are cooking at home and not eating out all the time.   I have cut back my drinking to what fits within my ww plan.  Then I have tried to keep myself from binge eating in the evenings by walking my dogs instead.
