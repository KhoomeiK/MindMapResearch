1200isplenty,fe0lhmq,t1_fe0l11v,1578815563.0,"The issue is that yes, a treat is fine. But it's incredibly easy to snack on these more than once a week. It all adds up and it will delay weight loss and will still have adverse effects on overall health. These ""only \_\_\_\_ calories"" boxes of processed foods are just a way to continue selling mass produced garbage to the masses because they know people want to try and improve themselves. They had to adapt. By buying a product like this, you're only supporting them. It's fairly easy to make a home-made treat like this and weigh it all out at home. Even if it doesn't look pretty, you can create something that tastes just as lovely with alternative ingredients."

enfj,fb8tyy9,t3_ebluqc,1576621832.0,"For me, it's over-expressing myself and hyperactivity. I sort of go on, and on about my life and what I like about that person. ""Wow, I really like that you ..., when I was little I used to ... too, but you're amazing at it.""  Things like that. I also like to go on about my past without sparing any details. I personally find it to be a flaw, but only when I act this way toward people who are by nature cruel."
enfj,fb8tj6z,t3_ec0aqs,1576621551.0,"Every bad choice I've made in my past. I can over-analyze for hours in bed, zoning in and out and debating what I'd do different and why. It drives me insane sometimes."

Sometimes personality types don't really come into play, it's more they are just rude. That, or perhaps someone has told them something negative about you or something along those lines."
enfj,fb8sfj7,t3_ebxxz9,1576620840.0,"1. It all depends, for me it used to be the case, but over time I've learned to stop this from occurring by reminding myself to have a more logical mindset. 

2. I usually forget about people unless they're around me a lot. I don't worry about what others are up to, unless they matter to me and have had a significant impact on me. 

3. Yes, somewhat. Although it's mostly irritation because I keep over-analyzing things I may have said or did to cause potential rejection. I usually see myself as the problem.

4. Yes, but I am able to control the feeling and I often express it through humor. As an example, if my friend is talking about weight loss, I'd say: ""Can't relate"" and briefly talk about an obsession with nachos. I find that it cheers myself up."
