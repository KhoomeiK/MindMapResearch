I have less spirals (used to split every single night without fail and be really insomniac), I eat more often, and I can enjoy things that I otherwise would be unable to enjoy because of BPD- stuff I love like video games, but it also makes the less fun stuff like chores or work more tolerable.

It's vital sometimes, but it's not as simple as sitting at home and being happy. Happiness doesn't come from sitting around and doing nothing all day. I am stagnant in so many ways, I am now incredibly avoidant, I never leave my house.
I was close to suicide when I left work, so close. And I'm close to being able to take my next few steps in life and start over. But it's still so far off. 
If you have to leave to get better, do it. But leaving won't bring happiness. Leaving my job made my life so much worse, and I started backsliding in many ways that I now need to fix. I don't regret it because I know Its possible that I wouldn't have a life to fix if I hadn't left. But I encourage you to not put your life on hold like that if you can avoid it. It's hard to come back from."

Jealousy isn't healthy in a monogamous or polyamorous relationship. It's often just used as an excuse to control your partner. You can have healthier relationships, even with BPD, and pruning your desire for a jealous partner as well as your own jealousies will only help you be stronger.
