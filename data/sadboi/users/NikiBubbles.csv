AskReddit,fhkawab,t3_f3i60f,1581675476.0,"I was walking to my office, returning from my break. In the middle of the day, crowded street. There was some beggar on the street. He didn’t looke like a homeless person, just a young immigrant from Asia. He asked me if I had any money. I said no (I didn’t) and continued walking. He came close to me and whispered to my ear — “I’m going to rip your asshole”. Nice.

Another one. I am in a park, sitting by the lake, drawing. Several drunk men in their 40s came close to me, started looking at what I was drawing. One of them said — “Lady, you have a very nice breasts”. I was 15, by the way.

Men who do this, can you please not? Thanks."

I can't imagine that this prequel will give me any explanation to why Snow didn't see his system failing him in the trilogy. He was just a decently written bad guy from the ruling class who was a sociopath. Therefore I don't really want to know about the struggles he faces in this prequel.
