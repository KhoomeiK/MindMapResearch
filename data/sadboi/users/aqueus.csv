LegendsOfRuneterra,fj7wex2,t3_fbutyv,1583099750.0,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned that the game doesn't appear to differentiate between ""buffs"" and ""debuffs"". The game just lists the changes to a card.

If you wanted to remove specific ""buffs"" to all cards, you'd need to list them. Ephemeral is a debuff? Not if you're trying to level up Hecarim or play off Soul Shepherd's +1/+1. Purify is a debuff? Quite the opposite, it removes all changes to a card - including potential ""debuffs"" like the -1/-0 from Skitterer.

I think a better wording might be ""Play: Revert all permanent changes made to a follower's health, power, and keywords made by spells this turn."" 

A bit wordy, but it clarifies that you want to 'change things back', but clearly delineates between spells, spell damage, and battle damage - so that only permanent changes that come from spells like Stand Alone, Mark of the Isles, etc. get cleared."

I get what you're saying - those effects don't *resolve*, but no one cares about that, because that's not what the level up text implies.

When I'm looking at which decks to copy like the filthy netdecker I am, I use the highest game count to weight the win percentage.

I'll be honest, I was very surprised there was a new one of these out so soon after the previous one. I imagined that was why there was a smaller sample size - because not enough time had passed to allow as many games to happen.

Edit: The sheet ""2-24 Masters Most Popular Deck Stats (Mobalytics Tracker Data)"" has a total of 11929 games listed, while the 2-27 version has 5609 games - very slightly less than half. Are there less Masters players? Was time a factor?"

You paid for the bounce target once, paid for the 3/2, then eventually pay for the bounce target a second time. It's extremely bad value. The only reason it ends up being a good trade is due to Play effects.

It's still a great trade for Mystic Shot, Black Spear, Will of Ionia, Fleetfeather Tracker (a 1-cost unit), etc.

The problem probably stems more from Solitary Monk (and by extension Stand Alone) - the current reigning mega-monster Elusive.

It also allows an unblocked attacker to swing for more suddenly, a la Back to Back, Brothers' Bond, etc.

Additionally, Vile Feast is more of a tech card. The value it provides is in key unit removal when the unit has 1 Health, a very unique position for the enemy to be in. However, it doesn't happen early on because the SI player is looking to play their own cards. 

Typically SI play looks like: Turn 1: nothing (1 saved Spell Mana), Turn 2: Spider/Wraith/Elise/etc., Turn 3: Probably play another 2-drop (2 saved Spell Mana - if Spear is in hand, Vile Feast isn't going to be played except in extremely specific scenarios), Turn 4: Wraithcaller.

Turn 5 is the first chance the SI player has the room to consider playing a 'frivolous' spell like Vile Feast, and the game is almost over at this point (probably another 2 turns left).

Between frostbite effects and challenger units, my elusives couldn't kill a single one of their units, despite having drawn two Stand Alone and two Back to Back and being able to use them both at pivotal moments - both cancelled out by frostbite effects. I mean am I supposed to expect that they have a 6th frostbite card in three turns? Oh and they were sitting on double Harsh Winds? Wellp, guess that's a loss.

The second loss was much closer, but both decks just had so much more synergy than my deck had and, having written down my options, I don't see how I ever-ever-ever could've even competed against the first deck. The second deck, maybe if I hadn't drawn a bricked up hand?

LegendsOfRuneterra,fhcrter,t1_fhawosv,1581469469.0,"Isn't Teemo one of those champions? 

Compared to Tryndamere, Ashe, Elise, Hecarim, Thresh, even Draven and Darius are up there in power. With elusives being as prominent as they are, Teemo is pretty terrible. He has to survive to turn 3 with no elusives on the opposing side or, at best, some spells to push 15 puffcaps onto the enemy, even then, how is he succeeding at that? Chump Whump? At 4 mana?"

LegendsOfRuneterra,fhb2egr,t1_fhahqzh,1581433237.0,"I think you're mistaken about how much time it'll save you:

3 PVP Wins Daily, 7 Days: 9100	
10 AI/PVP Losses, 7 Days: 7350	
Minimum Quest XP, 7 Days: 7000	
Week Total W/ Above Numbers: 23450

That alone puts you 1550 XP off of max chest. If 3 of your quests are 1500 XP quests instead of 1000 XP quests, then you are missing 50 XP. 

And this is all ignoring Expedition mode, which can net you a truckload of XP in the best of cases, and still shore up the missing XP in the worst of cases.

I mean, I understand if there are days when you don't want to spam-loss to get max numbers, or if you don't have time or luck to get 3 PVP wins - and I do get your point - but I don't think the system is going to change. 

It's already exceptionally easy to bank quests, reroll 1k quests to 1.5k quests and generally earn max weekly rewards."
LegendsOfRuneterra,fhavylj,t3_f258tz,1581428556.0,"I'm here for this. 

You have Battlesmith in the middle of the rares. Maybe he used to cost more? Now he's 2, and so he's at the beginning of the Demacia rares. Figured you'd want to correct this since (as far as I can tell) every other card is in perfect sequence - thank you for that, by the way. Once I decided to start typing in numbers, it went by *super* fast.

Thank you for your work!"

You are valid. Your experience was hell, and your feelings aren't unique. It's common to feel dirty when you're abused like that. You were abused. It wasn't your fault, and you didn't deserve it.

I highly suggest therapy. I know that can be hard to arrange as a college student, but it's *the* way you're going to get to a point where you can have a healthy sexual relationship with someone.

My abuse ended when I was 9. I'm 34 now and just now getting to a point where I can engage in sex without having panic attacks, shutting down, or reliving the rape experience. Certain things still trigger me, but I've definitely come to a point where I can start carving out what I consider to be a normal life. 

You can too. 

It takes time. It is painful, but it is possible.

Stay safe. Be kind to yourself."

I think I saw a previous incarnation of this deck (or someone else's interpretation), and they basically swapped Mystic Shot and Statikk Shock for Deny and Shadow Assassin (which is what I thought you were referencing originally).

**Why the flip from IO to P&Z? Is it to fair better in the mirror?**"

LegendsOfRuneterra,fgyizkz,t1_fgxd2sv,1581183835.0,"Can you elaborate? What's balancing/unbalancing about this? You can't target Ashe's effect, it only 'goes after' the strongest unit. But if you frostbite something and then they use Redoubled Valor on it and bring it up to a level that can kill Ashe, when you swing with Ashe, she's going to ignore that unit because it's been frostbitten this round."
