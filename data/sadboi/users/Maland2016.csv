mylittlepony,fr5v6p9,t1_fr5k14c,1589915205.0,"Bon Bon has woken up many times to Lyra almost ominously T-posing over their bed. Tonight is one such night, as the light-yellow mare rubs her eyes, both in her tired state and as well as pure annoyance. She glares up at the standing pony, Lyra’s hooves outstretched to full length as she wore a large grin. 

“...Why.”

“I’m asserting dominance!”

“Sweet Celestia, just go to *bed*, Ly,” is the only response the other pony receives as Bon Bon rolls back over into bed, pulling the covers up. Lyra’s hooves hang limp at her sides, a disappointed expression on her face, before grumbling unintelligible words under her breath as she clambered under the covers. 

She opens her mouth to speak again: “You underestimate my p-“

The covers are almost instantly torn from her as Bon Bon snuggles under the weight of, give or take, 50% more blanket. Lyra sulks, and what’s worse is now she’s chilly, too, but she gives occasional glances over to her marefriend, only to receive none in return. 

A few minutes pass, and suddenly Lyra herself is pulled under the weight of the blankets, Bon Bon holding her close; perhaps almost a little *too* close. This time, Lyra doesn’t do or say anything: she lets the moment occur as it does.

She’s fine with this, as is Bon Bon.

Both of them drift off in each other’s hooves.

...On a related note, I end up making myself sad whenever I consider that Twilight could technically be immortal, or at least she ages much more slowly than the others. Celestia and Luna did their thing for at least a thousand years, possibly much longer than that, so they’ve seen a lot of folks come and go, and since Twilight now rules Equestria, her lifespan has possibly been extended as well. 

But in Twilight’s case, she’s close to a lot of them. Just imagine her face when news comes by that the first one of her friends has passed, and because she was busy, she wasn’t there to see her friend off.

And then she remembers that she isn’t mortal, at least not in the traditional sense. She’s probably going to outlive *all* of them.

God, that’s depressing, being the last one of your friends to die, and you don’t even know how long that will take. While their stories get passed down, you are the only one who truly remembers them, what they did for you, how they loved you. Sure, it means that you’ll make sure that they will be remembered, but... they’re not there when you need them. 

Only memories remain.

Gull Doctors: *The coastline-dwelling brethren of the Gulls tend to practice more traditional methods of healing, such as ancient rituals and diets. They’re also known for being a teeny bit stubborn in those ways, whether any good or bad comes out of them.*

mylittlepony,foljby1,t3_g80a9f,1587863468.0,"I’ve been wondering what a Pony!Midnight Sparkle would be like, how it would happen. 

Personally, I’m thinking a corruption that happens after Cadance and Shining’s wedding, after Chrysalis is defeated. When Twilight was at her lowest, her friends turned away from her, completely fooled by the Queen.

So she believes she’s not worthy of her element, and she completely breaks. It’s kind of like what Steven went through, except instead of crippling self-worth and a desperate need to keep doing what you used to do, Twilight just has to deal with... well, a lot of stress and trust issues. 

Her friends try to get her back, but Midnight is too far gone by her emotions to even consider it. 

I think that would’ve made a nightmarish ending, maybe a cliffhanger for S3 to start on! 

Maybe I should write this as a fanfic or somethin’... It’ll probably get a bit angsty and dark, but... y’know, so did the show at points. Plus, I think it’ll be fun to write!"
