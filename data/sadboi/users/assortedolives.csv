oddlyspecific,fc0q25m,t1_fc0oyy6,1577296896.0,"Oh wow!! It's this christmas party game where everyone brings a gift and then everyone chooses a number. 

Person with #1 goes first and chooses a present and then person #2 can choose to steal person 1's now unwrapped gift or choose a new gift. It keeps going on like that until all gifts have been given. 

Gifts typically can only be stolen twice before they're ""dead"". There's totally an episode of The Office where Michael turns secret santa into white elephant and everyone's person specific gifts get screwed up."
