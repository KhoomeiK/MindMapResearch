depression,fovsune,t3_g9ndgw,1588106930.0,I’m not sure if it’s the same but I’m now 21 and when I was 16 I became anxious and depressed. Now 5 years on (still with anxiety & depression) and most of my memories are gone from my past. My therapist told me this can happen from being low for so long. I hate it! It makes me feel stupid but I feel like it was my brains way of trying to block out all the bad stuff but it’s also blocked out all the good stuff.

ballpython,f0dlrnx,t1_f0dj5ka,1568555749.0,Aww how sweet. I’d say Daenerys hasn’t quite lived up to her name yet. She’s more of a season 1 Daenerys rather then a season 8!
ballpython,f0dezc4,t1_f0d94vm,1568553298.0,I think they are mostly colouration marks or could just be as they are so white any marks show up more on them then most morphs. I’m going to keep an eye on them though as I’ve only had her two days
ballpython,f0decsh,t1_f0d4h88,1568553071.0,I’m unsure where they have come from or if they are just colouration marks but her previous owner said she has always eaten from frozen so shouldn’t be from bites
