AskReddit,fhs39w1,t3_f4gsxv,1581851675.0,Went to a children's play area in a park drunk. Climbed into one of those swings designed for toddlers and got my ass stuck in it. Had to be pulled out by my friends and had ripped the skin off my lower back and butt.

Went private but when I tried to negotiate seeing my counceller fortnightly and spread the cost (due to it costing Â£40 a session) she said that didn't suit her and recommend me going back through NHS services again.

Honestly at such a loss, I don't know what to do anymore."

BPD,fb44plc,t3_eb6mot,1576501414.0,This is an incredible achievement and also very inspiring. You should be super proud of yourself and I wish you all the best in your new found sobriety :)
BPD,f5untrp,t1_f5tb0rw,1572476433.0,Ended up walking away in the end. After a year of getting fucked about and lied to and told things would change. He spent all that time telling me that they weren't together and he'd leave as soon as his lease was up but he never did. I had enough in the end and got out of there.
BPD,f5tarz4,t3_dp88bp,1572454269.0,"I thought this was my post for a moment. The exact same thing happened to me a few years back. It is  huge red flag, if they weren't together you'd be invited over."
BPD,f5p7p4k,t3_do9x4w,1572351686.0,"My best friend of 11 years has BPD and so do I. Our friendship finally ended about 6 months ago when she finally cut all ties with me.

She had been struggling a lot the year prior and pushing people away so our communication was very infrequent, and eventually she had deleted all social media and cut off contact with all of her friends. We didn't fall out, the communication just slowly died out over a year. 

I miss her, she was also like a sister to me. Sometimes I think of writing her a letter and posting it to her but I'm also not sure if she wants to hear from me again. 

I hope you're doing okay, it can be hard losing a friend, especially when you're known then for so long. Maybe you could give it some time and then find a way to reach out to them, at least to check and see if they're doing okay :)"
BPD,f4znqdt,t3_dmdgf2,1571911839.0,"Hey there! I'm also not doing to great today and feel like I'm really struggling. I've turned my phone off and logged out of social media so I can be alone and have some peace. I think as others have said, it is important to take small steps and remember that eventually this will pass and you will feel better. Do something to distract yourself- I'm currently watching TV while I browse reddit. Reading helps keep my mind active and away from negative thoughts, and the voices on TV help me feel less alone.

If you want to chat, just drop me a message :)"
MaladaptiveDreaming,etxg3tm,t3_cdy9jr,1563298602.0,"Sometimes I feel as though I would. I have a few different dream words but one consistsant one for a few years now. I do sometimes think how much simpler life would be if I could live there instead. I could be the perfect version of myself.

 But then I don't always feel this way, I don't dislike my life and for the most parts I enjoy it. I've found hobbies I enjoy, friends I like, a family I care about and a boyfriend who I adore. These things have kept me grounded, even though I still daydream everyday.

I think it's important to find things in real life you enjoy so you're not relying on fiction as your sole source of happiness."

It's great to talk to someone who relates and understands. I'm glad to hear you sought help and you've had some success with it. I'm positive that you'll continue to improve :)

'll be sure to take your advice and work on myself and positive thinking. Hopefully I can slowly outgrow the negative patterns I've fallen into."
relationship_advice,es1pvt3,t1_es1nvn3,1561502707.0,"Thank you so much for this response it's really given me a lot to thing about. I realise this is a deep rooted issue within myself that isn't just going to go away unless I seek help. I'd never really considered it as an option but I now think it will be the best way forward for me. 

Thanks again for your advice and I wish you all the best in your relationship also! :)"
relationship_advice,es1m5xn,t1_es1m3ua,1561500056.0,I haven't considered this but would certainly be open to it.
relationships,eqricen,t1_eqri2dl,1560261712.0,Yeah I clearly didn't elaborate and just listed all the bad. Well she works in a middle school and she's wonderful with children and helps mentor  troubled kids. But honestly I think I'm just trying to justify why I'm friends with her. I think we have different values and its about time I dropped her as a friend.
