explainlikeimfive,fqjmigy,t3_giy6lz,1589412068.0,"It has to be perpendicular to the axis of rotation and parallel to gravity. Once you leave the equator, there will be a component of gravity that, instead of pulling the elevator down towards earth, it's pulling it a little to the side. Or, if you build the elevator so that it's parallel to the gravitational force when not on the equator, then the axis of rotation will not be 90 degrees to the elevator and therefore the rotation of the earth is pulling the elevator to the side. On the equator, both gravity and rotation of the earth are working towards keeping the elevator straight. 

Technically the space elevator is orbiting Earth. And you can't have something orbiting a planet without it orbiting around the center. Because the earth spins around an axis, that's not possible if you place it anywhere else but the equator."

But yes. I get depressive episodes out of nowhere, even though everything seems to be going fine but it's always triggered by something small such as school stress, which for normal people is a normal stressor which shouldn't cause a downward spiral. So techbically it is brain chemistry. I think healthy life style and routines helps a lot with staying stable, and also coming up with ways to soothe yourself when you feel depressive feelings sink in. For me it works to tell myself that I'm fine and there's nothing that's actually wrong. But not always.

That's why I think good professional help is much better than ""talking to a friend"". And no friend can help you if you don't want to get better. Unfortunately you have to want to get better. That's how much you gotta work yourself. You can be forced to go to therapy, but even then it won't work if your attitude from the beginning is ""I can't be helped, I will never get better and these therapists are dumb"". Yes the therapists may be dumb but you don't have to believe everything they say, and also you have to realize they're also human. If they make you feel worse then obviously change therapiasts. It's pretty much impossible to help someone get out of depression if they have this attitude. I believe those people just want to figure it out on their own. Maybe they need time and support.

So please don't just wait, do something like find a good therapist to help you. And medication too. It works, once you find the correct one. I've tried. If it doesn't, keep looking. Time is not your enemy. Everyone who's healing needs time and rest, and you deserve to take both. I know how shitty the system can be in some countries, but I hope you can find a way to be able to rest. And trust me once you've gotten significantly better, 2 years feels like such a short time, so don't worry about ""losing your best years"" or whatever bs someone made you believe.

You just need a doctor and some rest. Sure its not that easily done, but people think, I used to think, that depression is impossible to treat with therapy and meds and what not. I used to think that I'm going to be depressed forever because how terrible the world is and how terrible I am and how I don't fit in etc. But my attitude changed. With some therapy, changing university, good routines... I started to get better slowly. Not saying that's how it will work for someone else.

Like therapy isn't rocket science, the biggest effect is just talking to someone real in front of you, someone who will actually give you helpful responses. Someone who might give you advice and perspective you didn't think about. Because let's be real when you're depressed you have tunnel vision. All you can see is depressive things. There's no one set thing that will help you get better. It's a combination of many things just like the reason you got depressed probably is a combination of a lot of things. So maybe if you can get those things in order one by one, slowly, you'll start to see improvement. Depression isn't something you snap out of. It's more like a rope attached to a weight that's pulling you down. And you get rid of it by reducing the weight little at a time. One day you'll realise you've made progress and there's only the rope left. And at that point it will feel like nothing, because of all the strength you've gained by pulling that weight. And that's the important part. To feel like you're on the right track. All it takes to start to get better is a genuine push from yourself to get better. You'll be surprised how you can control your depressed brain with positive affirmations. Instead of thinking you're fucked and everything's gonna fall apart, simply stopping and thinking ""I'm gonna be fine"" and giving yourself a break can make a huge difference."

AskReddit,fmqovps,t1_fmq0y4m,1586303929.0,"Yeah, you can create lift just by tilting a flat plane at a slight angle toward the direction of motion. That's how flaps work although they also create drag. If you assume that an airfoil slices through air where the bottom of it is parallel to the direction of motion, the airflow will be negative to the motion of direction. Therefore as air moves around the wing, there will be a pocket of low pressure air behind the part where the top starts to curve down, since most of the air is trying to move to the negative direction of motion instead of moving with the surface. And because there's a lower pressure above the wing, there's lift by definition. That's how I imagine it works. But I could be wrong because I haven't really studied it thoroughly."
AskReddit,fmpy8l7,t1_fmpwkd5,1586289497.0,"Well actually when a plane is flying inverted it has to use the elevator (push forward on the yoke) in order for it to stay level, because otherwise the lift of the wing would be pushing it downwards. Because using the elevator pitches the nose up when inverted that means the air hits the wing at a different angle than normal and while it doesn't work as efficiently anymore, it can work to lift the plane even when inverted. There will be more drag but that way the air above the wing (when inverted) still has a farther distance to travel which will create lower pressure above the wing which will result in lift."

So how do you ignore it? Well, as an example, personally I used to see all these posts that were directly or indirectly hating on men. I saw them all over Twitter. That place was toxic in other ways too now that I've left it. I know there is injustice and things that people say and think that is really hard to comprehend how someone can think that. But they exist and I can't do anything about it. It's a waste of time trying to argue with someone who knows they're wrong but are doing it just to cause a reaction or push their absurd agenda. So its best to ignore which also helps prevent it from spreading. 

There are things you have no control over. And there's gonna be shitty things in life and the world, that's just what's gonna happen always and forever. What you can do is make the best out of living on this planet. As an analogy, say you were living in a beautiful jungle. Instead of spending your time worrying about the snakes and crocodiles, you spend your time building a shelter, collecting all the amazing fruits and enjoying the weather. When it rains, it will be inconvenient, but it won't affect you as much because you built that shelter. 

Sorry if this is not helpful but seriously it would take mental superpowers to be able to share how I cope with this and how I've gotten better. Just remember to take care of yourself first and dont focus on things that aren't in your control anyway, such as someone else's feelings, thoughts and opinions. And be more in control of yourself."

I don't think my personality would work for being a waiter... I could still do it for a while. Maybe I'd realize some things and actually enjoy it. When you're young you're supposed to try things and 26 is indeed very young still. Besides people are different."
depression,flp88vi,t1_flp75o7,1585353698.0,"That's not what I'm saying but okay, I understand your attitude. I'm just saying it's possible but it takes effort and lots of small steps. I'm not here to help you because it's impossible to help anyone with depression over a Reddit comment, I'm just sharing something I know. I've felt hopeless enough to think nothing will change and the only way is down. But I'm just here to tell you with proper help and your own effort, as long as you give at least 1% of your energy to trying to get rid of depression every day, you will eventually be able to get better. It's a slow process and therapy and even meds may be very useful. Hope you have a good night or whatever time of day you have."
