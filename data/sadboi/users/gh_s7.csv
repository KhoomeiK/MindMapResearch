techwearclothing,fp9hsdq,t3_gbo9mb,1588426552.0,"if anyone is looking for a really cool looking, highly efficient mask, I just bought a Respro Techno Gold mask from [The Visor Shop](https://www.thevisorshop.com/Mobile/en/Respro--Techno-Gold-Face-Mask-Black/m-m-5830.aspx)!

their customer service was fantastic; they kept in touch with me about delays they experienced on receiving their shipment & were extremely patient with my broke-ass as I was trying to decide if I needed to cancel the order or not. The Visor Shop is apparently, like, the UK‚Äôs biggest cycling parts & equipment website, so they‚Äôve had years of customer service experience. 

delivery was with DHL & was incredibly fast, arriving in two days from time of shipment; my order ended up being shipped an entire week before the last in-stock date they provided me, and was delivered right to my door instead of to the apartment‚Äôs leasing office like other shipping methods. 

as far as the mask itself, I originally discovered the Respro brand while looking for a ventilated facewarmer for winter bike commuting. I decided against buying one then because the aesthetics were a little too intense for dailywear, but once the pandemic worsened I knew it was Finally Time!

they have quite a few types of masks & have the details of each listed on a special COVID page, but I went with the Techno because it has both activated charcoal and HEPA-type filtering, as well as comfortable straps that attach at the back with wide velcro for easy adjustment (which I have found to be GREAT for helping to get the perfect fit!)

I‚Äôm not affiliated with either company! I‚Äôm just excited to finally be able to be SLIGHTLY more out n about than I have been these last six weeks‚Ä¶"

first of all, I am a cis woman (thought this was posted on one of the BPD subreddits I follow), so part of it is that literally most sex is not extensive enough for me to even come close to orgasming. 

I‚Äôm an adult child of an alcoholic and I have major codependency issues, so it leads me to try to save people with issues that only they can fix (like alcoholism)‚Ä¶ I put so much into that relationship because he actually understood so much of the chaos that I went through before I moved outta my parents‚Äô house AND we had crazy sex on top of that, it was insanely satisfying at first! but eventually it turned out that all the ‚Äúhopes and plans for a future together‚Äù were just bullshit 

so I‚Äôm dealing with trying to balance my gut instinct for intense mind blowing sex with wanting to continue working through my codependency & addiction to addicts‚Ä¶. 

like right now I‚Äôm crushing HARD on another man who understands my chaos but is also an alcoholic & a former drug addict like my ex, so I‚Äôm trying to deeply analyze my attraction to him rather than act on instinct like I did when I was in more stressful living situations‚Ä¶ 


I cried earlier tonight thinking about how I got to play with one of my coworker‚Äôs hair & massage a different one‚Äôs face because I deeply miss all the casual, simple affection I got to give and receive in my relationship with my ex‚Ä¶ even after he became my ex and eventually started a relationship with a new woman (literally he‚Äôs now married to first one he seriously dated after me). 

I feel so conflicted by how my love for him put me in so many situations where I didn‚Äôt abide by my own moral code. I don‚Äôt want to fall into that shit again, but how do I manage all these pieces of what I want while enacting then in a healthy manner? 

I desperately want someone who understands what it‚Äôs like to have ADHD & be an ACoA, who shares at least some of my wide-ranging interests (which this crush does!) without being a manipulative piece of shit. 

how‚Ä¶ do I fucking do that? how??? I‚Äôm trying to slowly figure it out while trying not to drown in my loneliness.

edit: when he first started getting serious with his now-wife, I cried the first time I heard Vance Joy‚Äôs ‚ÄúRiptide‚Äù because of the line ‚ÄúI wanna be your left-hand man‚Äù, meaning someone trusted & relied upon like a right-hand man, yet for more underhanded & sneaky reasons. I knew I would never be his priority ever again but I couldn‚Äôt let him go. 

now I listen to that song and I totally identify with the line ‚Äúrunning down to the riptide, taken away to the dark side‚Äù because I literally let myself get swept away in the ocean of his bullshit in order to become ‚Äúhis left-hand man‚Äù

at least I‚Äôve ‚Äúooooh‚Ä¶ become unstuck‚Äù"

BPD,fh7fso3,t3_f1mggw,1581329609.0,"I have before, lost my work keys TWICE during that shit‚Ä¶ thankfully like two years apart and under different managers, but still it‚Äôs terrifying. 

one of the times involved me driving home from work and tossing my keys in the front seat before I went into the house, like I swear I remember hearing them hit the passenger side glass window and glancing to ensure I hadn‚Äôt broken the glass but they were just 100% gone 

I don‚Äôt remember what happened the second time exactly but it was an obscenely stressful day because my BF at the time relapsed drinking after I had volunteered to cover a shift for someone I hated (making me work a total of 16 hours that day), and I remember very quickly telling my boss that I couldn‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt do it before leaving‚Ä¶ that time, the keys ended up being found under the ad rack near the front fucking door MONTHS later.

edit to say that depersonalization and derealization are a common part of BPD, so it‚Äôs definitely a thing that happens to a lot of us"

I hope he‚Äôs treating his current wife well.

going no contact was rough the first month because of how angry I was at his further attempts at manipulation but I knew I couldn‚Äôt even try to explain to him why I was so angry because he‚Äôd twist it into me being abusive and toxic

NoStupidQuestions,fh48il1,t1_fh42i7h,1581276328.0,"yeah but from my understanding, every local area‚Äôs attempts at specifically banning plastic bags/single use plastics has been litigated by a retail lobbying group because of a law that says it‚Äôll any law has to be made at a state level, which I‚Äôm sure I would‚Äôve heard about

I have seen the publix campaign to educate about reusable bags (it‚Äôs actually helped me remember to take mine to other stores in general haha) but from the talk I‚Äôve heard from Publix employees I know, they‚Äôre hammering so hard on the reusable bags because they really, really don‚Äôt want to have to swap over to doing free paper bags. that could just be the specific local area management‚Äôs feelings, so who knows."

so you know those potsticker dumplings where you‚Äôre supposed to boil them then saut√© them? yeah I used to often just boil them in my shallow saut√© pan, like for real, which required carefully pulling them off the heat when they reached rolling boil, so it was easily  believed when I said I fucked up on that

I‚Äôm so glad I am past the point of burning myself but I really miss having ‚Äúa project‚Äù involving cleaning and bandaging a specific part of my body‚Ä¶ 

thinking back to my ex helping me take care of the wound makes me so sad because his abandonment was the trigger for it, and he surprised me by actually legitimately trying to help me heal‚Ä¶ sigh, it actually healed a lot better by having someone tell me not to pick at it and to remember to put ointment on, but that wasn‚Äôt the point."
