https://www.uspto.gov/page/about-trademark-infringement
https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/when-you-need-permission-use-trademarks.html

From my understanding, basically if they can convince a court that people might be buying your product because they think it belongs to the people who own the Dragon Ball franchise, then you can be sued. In other words if people might be buying things in your game because they think it is a ""real"" dragon ball game. Which in this case, I think would be pretty easy to do if you use the dragon ball names, characters etc.

I think your situation is quite similar to this quote from the above source:

> Trademark infringement is the unauthorized use of another person or company's registered trademark. For example, if you wanted to start making electronic gadgets and decided to stamp Apple's recognizable fruit-shaped logo onto your products, this would be fairly obvious trademark infringement. Customers are likely to be confused about the origin of the goods, and you would essentially be profiting from the goodwill that Apple has generated over many decades.
>     
> Put differently, consumers would mistakenly buy your product assuming it was the ""real"" Apple product. In such a situation, Apple could sue for trademark infringement. Not only could it win a court order requiring that you stop infringing, but it could also win money damages.


Like I said, I think some people get a way with it, by calling it a tribute, and not making any money from it, and not really getting a big following. In that case, TOEI ANIMATION may not care enough.  But If you get big enough, and start making enough money they will start caring.

One way you could go about it, is to make the game and just wait and see if you get a ""cease and desist"" letter. But that is probably not the best business strategy IMO."

ProgrammerHumor,f4f0x16,t1_f4bvi5g,1571565327.0,"I would try to ask them why it is that way. Maybe they have a reason (probably a bad one, but still). At least when you find the reason, you might have more of a chance to persuade them.

Also it can look bad sometimes being the new guy coming in and telling them to change everything without even finding out the reasons for what they do.

edit: if git is too scary, then maybe a simpler scm (svn maybe?)"
