EatingDisorders,fjahrqs,t3_f694mu,1583173759.0,"I have a similar thing going on as well. I was diagnosed with anorexia and bulimia a while ago. And although I’m healthier now and recovered. I only eat specific foods. I currently eat exclusively chipotle and nothing else. Idk why. It’s not like I’m restricted, I just can’t get myself to eat any other food. So idk what’s wrong with me either tbh."
EatingDisorders,fjagn43,t3_f8pg16,1583173104.0,"I’ve had a similar situation. She had a ED before I did. But I eventually developed one after she almost triggered me into having one cuz I already had body image issues. I eventually got worse than she was and let’s just say, ending things off was the best thing I could do for myself. 

I hate to say it, but you gotta put yourself first."
EatingDisorders,fjag8yq,t3_faa2ke,1583172872.0,"Yes men can have eating disorders. I’m 16m and I’ve been diagnosed with anorexia and bulimia. And honestly man, I recommend you get help. I’m telling you. Ik it’s hard and I didn’t want to either but it’s 100% worth it. Ik man. I hated and still to an extent hate my body and I still get triggered and thing my disordered eating habits will help my body images issues. But they almost make you hyper focus on the little parts of your body you don’t like. Please get help before it’s too late. Ik it’s horrible to live like this, so please get help"
LardClub,firbtza,t3_f5fp1w,1582661375.0,Very nice Viktoria
bullying,fhec8ph,t3_f2poxj,1581519172.0,"Oh yeah my elementary had something like this as well. We had the “bully bench” where you could go if you were getting bullied and needed a friend. It never worked and it ended up becoming a meme in both the elementary and when I was in middle school. But yeah, it definitely worsened the bullying problem."
Offensivejokes,fgt4ik6,t3_f028d5,1581098880.0,Definitely confusing trans people with feminazis I have a lot of trans friends and they’re pretty chill.
LardClub,ffc4erd,t3_estcqq,1579791261.0,What
ftm,fenz1t8,t3_epyoqg,1579292911.0,Oh no. I’m just waiting for the edgy 14 year old Kalvin Garrah fans to come barging in.
EatingDisorders,fekg105,t3_e1w95x,1579199272.0,Disconnect yourself from food.
depression,fek3gx1,t3_eph52w,1579191809.0,Stay healthy with it man. I believe in you. And sorry you dad doesn’t accept it. I’m 16m and also bi so I understand. It’ll get better
LardClub,fegmyq7,t3_end7yq,1579097613.0,Do you have any other image on your phone?
depression,fe9pg87,t3_enrhnc,1578940320.0,"Damn, society is fucked. Ik I probably sound like an sjw but the fact that people won’t take you seriously because of who you are pisses me off. Sounds cliché, but things will get better, and if you are in danger to yourself definitely go to the ER or something. Sorry if this isn’t helpful, but I stand by you."
depression,fe9ot42,t1_fe6zbx0,1578940107.0,"I agree. I’m also a guy and my arms are pretty much covered in scars. I hate it because I’m done with self harm, and now I have to live my life covered in these ugly scars. I switch from cutting to smoking weed. Idk it’s better than cutting, I’ll say that."
depression,fe9lpyh,t3_ent63z,1578939222.0,Me too man. Idk I feel fat and ugly. Ik I’m not fat but I just look like it. My parents just tell me to man up so I don’t think they care.
eatingdisorderstories,fdx13i7,t1_fdu4vt0,1578764216.0,"Thank you. I will say I’ve been doing a little better with my eating. My biggest problem tho is that I feel like no one will love me if I gain weight so Idk. Although blocking her out of my life definitely helped. I no longer have to hear her say triggering things to me which is good. And I’ve been trying to get my weight back up just cuz I feel miserable when I’m at lower weights. So ig I’d say I’ve been taking care of myself a little bit more :) thank you, again."
depression,fdron60,t3_emrpqy,1578687440.0,Yoooooo happy birthday:DDD
LardClub,fdjxglb,t3_elm1p5,1578490585.0,Your waterproof hands might also be useful
delusionalartists,fc6dehz,t3_egbldb,1577477940.0,Not too bad for the price.
teenagers,fbb5q98,t1_fbb4suy,1576693871.0,"1. This is r/teenagers so obviously we are young 
2. You don’t have any statistics to prove that and it seems like you’re generalizing a whole community of people. 
3. Someone’s sexual experiences are not your or my business as long as it’s legal anyway."
teenagers,fbb4l3e,t1_fbayivs,1576693185.0,Bruh. I don’t know a single gay person that does that and like half my friends are gay lmao.
delusionalartists,fadyd07,t3_e8ps5e,1575989492.0,Why does it look human
depression,faa457t,t3_e7vxms,1575901696.0,"Yeah, I just quit NJROTC because I haven’t been motivated to go."
depression,fa2j8ca,t1_fa22dbt,1575782751.0,True. I just feel numb. But at the same time overloaded with emotions. And I don’t know what to do about it.
depression,fa2itej,t3_e7ol39,1575782609.0,Thank you man. It just feels really shitty. But I’ll try ig.
depression,fa20xc4,t1_fa20j85,1575776564.0,Yeah me too. I just feel alone and helpless. I wish people new how much it hurts but ik that I’d get bullied even more if they knew how it effected me.
depression,f9mvcqh,t3_e5yxmi,1575471100.0,I’ve never related to something more. My mum is constantly telling me how retarded I am and how I don’t matter. She says it would be funny if I died but I shouldn’t kill myself because she doesn’t want to get blamed for it. Im still in highschool so I can’t move out. But thanks for letting me know I’m not alone. You’re not alone either. And I’m sorry you’ve gotta go through that. You can get through it tho. I believe in you.
depression,f9mnvf6,t3_e5qwbg,1575465885.0,This is why I don’t seek help. I don’t see a point. There’s no reason anyone should put their energy into making me feel better when they can do that for someone who is actually important and matters. It’s a waste of time.
