I hope you recover well. And all the rest of you with guns at home please stay safe."

DIY,ey6croc,t3_cv9pc8,1566852582.0,I am in the middle of replacing some old floorboards in my downstairs floor and about to have a new carpet put in.  Noticed a lot of woodworm holes in the existing boards.  Does anyone know of a way to treat the issue and can ELI5 it to me?  Also a suitable product please (UK).  Thank you :)

Anxiety,evyvotm,t3_cls7pi,1564942567.0,"Fingers crossed. Because right now I'm in an anxiety hole! Myself, hubby and 2 kids are going on a mini break, 3 nights away in a place only around 2 hours drive from home. We have family there. Yet I am still SHITTING myself in case one of us becomes ill. (I have a phobia of vomiting or having any sort of stomach issues.... Plus IBS. Not a good combo.)
Edited to add.... I'd love to be a normal person who could just book a break and go on it. Be excited. Have fun. Boss the shit out of it.

One day maybe."
