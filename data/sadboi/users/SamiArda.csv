Mindfulness,fdn9cz3,t3_em4pe2,1578580744.0,"I'm a regular practitioner of meditation who may have a bit of wisdom to share here.

Letting go of the idea that there's a ""wrong way"" to be mindful is very important.  If you come to the realization you are somewhere, having any mundane sensation, and your brain connects it as by being aware of my unawareness I have become mindful in this moment.

And eventually, as those pathways strengthen, which they will with practice, mindfulness becomes something you can ""touch"" no matter what you're doing, and that full scope of awareness and understanding will come to your senses, bringing you to the present moment."
