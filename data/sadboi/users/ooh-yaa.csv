As I’ve gotten older I’ve realized I’m always going to have this, and it’s just how I deal with it and handle it mentally. I’m 20 and I live with my dad, but I’m trying to not be too hard on myself because I’m moving at my own pace and making things work. There’s this expectation in society and I’ve come to realize it doesn’t matter how you get things done, as long as you can make peace with yourself and you’re doing what you can."
