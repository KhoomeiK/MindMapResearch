Anxiety,fjlszd5,t3_fdygy1,1583453751.0,"I know how you feel. 
I work in retail and costumers seem to think: ""there is absolutely nothing wrong with sneezing/coughing into my hands and then handing things to the cashier. ""
It makes the probability to get this shit or any other shit for that matter a whole lot more likely. 
But I just remind myself that this virus is essentialy just a bad cold and if you have a half decent immune system you won't die. 
There is a vaccine in progress, a cure in progress and it is very treatable. 
Hand sanitizer makes my day a whole lot safer and myself less anxious. 
But don't buy sanitizer in bulk, because then people like me in retail and guys who need it because of medical reasons don't get any. 
This buying shit in bulk thing is more dangerous than the virus itself I think, because important things are not buyable for those who really need it.

You can inform yourself about the virus, the actual medical facts can be calming.
You can have a little sanitizer in your pocket to calm yourself.
Take care of your hands with creams and stuff cause of the frequent washing.
Avoid crowded spaces.
Get your attention away from the virus with something fun.
Stay ahead from your anxiety with facts and a bit of extra care."

I mean, if you want a fighting dog, you probably want a dog with a giant jaw that listenes to your every command instantly right? Not a dog who just attacks everyone and everything including you. So why is there a stigma around fighting dogs for being overly aggressive?
I've met the sweetest Rottweilers for example, but on the other hand got bitten by a jack russle terrier and most aggressive dogs I've met were terriers. But they have no such stigma, it's honestly confusing."

Then you have to tell the dentist about your fears, I think most will understand and be really cautious and reassure you. Talking helps with all doctors, just tell them about the issues.
And your headaches and that you generally feel bad with it may contribute to your anxiety, think about it this way: the sooner the molar is fixed, the sooner you feel better."
