My mother sent me a picture that was taken of me when I was younger and it appeared in the newspaper. Under the title, it says ""Victoria has been dead for more than a century."" If you look at this image rhetorically, why didn't she cut out that title and just focus the picture on the picture? It looked well planned. I read visually that I have been ""dead"" for 10 years. (I've been to college, lived abroad, and now work professionally through those years.) In her mind, I must remain infantile and submissive to her needs. I am ""dead"" to her now. Thanks, Mom.

I just had a therapy session about the same thing. I am bound to graduate in two months if I can finish my thesis. The program is an MA in English.

raisedbynarcissists,ffv2aut,t3_ev4x3s,1580254042.0,"I really thought I had normal parents until I realized many of their behaviors weren't normal, including ignoring me and neglecting me as a person. I was never asked my opinion. I would be the quiet one and nobody would care to ask about my opinion. They still don't ask me my opinion and have come up with their own conclusions about me (my mom, dad, and brother). At one point I was being called an alcoholic because of the way I acted as they know how to trigger my PTSD. No way in hell would I apologize for it. They don't see my actions as pain and suffering. 

I remember on a road trip with the three of them as a seventeen-year-old. and I wanted to chat with my parents who were walking hand in hand. They never responded to a damn thing as I was talking right at them while they were walking. I wasn't sure if they were alive or dead. I pinched my mother's hand really hard to get some sort of reaction but that didn't work that much either. I spend the rest of the trip just listening to podcasts. No one talked in the car.

I also remember another time at the dinner table where I did not want to talk. My dad asked me a question and I decided not to answer as he does to me often. He said that I couldn't do that as I don't have the power to do that. That was the first time I realized that silence was a form of rhetorical power that he has used all my life. 

I appreciate this subform as I feel less alone in this occasional insanity that was drilled into me."

OrthodoxChristianity,fep9dfs,t3_eq9dfr,1579315072.0,"When I first inquired about this, I was an inquirer into the church and not yet a catechumen. The priest told me it was okay to sketch icons. He told me that it was a way of communicating and getting to know the person in the icon. My patron saint was the first sketch I have ever done, and she became my patron saint two years later (St.Xenia of Petersburg). It's always best, though, to ask your priest. The practice of iconography is vast and it takes many years to become good at it. As a graduate student, I have no time. I hope to make more time in the future as I also enjoy sketching and icons! Good luck to you! :)"

I don't regret my decision. The church has greatly healed me in ways that I would have never expected to happen.

I knew something was different by the time I could manage to sit next to him and not be nervous at all about it. It was all in God's timing, honestly.

I had an overwhelming spiritual experience at the Greek Orthodox monastery, and I felt that I needed to wear a head covering to show my faith to God. Before I was uncomfortable with the idea, but now I am beginning to accept my role as a woman. It's refreshing to me as I was not raised to appreciate my role as a woman in my family of origin. As I draw closer to God, the more I feel I need to respect his love for me by showing modesty. I'm a new orthodox person of almost two years and I am now just beginning to wear a head covering.
