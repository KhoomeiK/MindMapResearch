asktransgender,fo13f7g,t3_g4xu4w,1587424962.0,"To have it make sense and for it to be “grammarly correct” or whatever, it’d be: “they HAVE a car”! So the latter in your question!

A lot of English speakers make this mistake- it’s one of the more common mistakes, from what I see anyways!"
Ghoststories,fo12soh,t3_g4yubd,1587424604.0,"Yeah it sounds like they’re a cat lover! It might also be that usually dogs and cats are the only one who sees them- like, entirely see them, if that makes sense -so maybe it had been a lonely ghost that was happy to see that living beings can actually see them! But yeah, I’d also be downright afraid if I suddenly heard a voice that wasn’t anyone I knew .-.

Also sorry about the loss of your cat!! Boots sounded like a nice cat to have around!!!"

AmItheAsshole,fo0g5zt,t3_g4u6s8,1587412539.0,"NTA, she had it coming to her. Saying all those things to you and your friends (sorry about that btw, that must’ve sucked), and then had the audacity to act like she never did those things? Yeah no, you were right to mention it! You were just getting bothered by her, so you wanted to stick up for yourself and your friends! I don’t see anything wrong with that!!"
socialanxiety,fnykghs,t3_g4mecj,1587365885.0,"You got this, my dude! Whenever I need to make phone calls, I always write down what I want to say (and revise it, if I need to) and rehearse it out loud so that I don’t stutter- but i have a natural stutter so i can’t really escape that! Maybe you could try that, it could help!! :0

Good luck though! It’ll turn out a-okay! A plus side to the aftermath, once you make these phone calls, you won’t have to worry about them anymore for the time being! You can relax then!! :3"
Paranormal,fnyjzjw,t3_g4hee5,1587365460.0,"Yeah, in my head I’m like “heck yeah, let’s go ghost hunting! I wanna see some GHOSTS” but once I’d experience something, I’d nope out of there so fast dude- 

Yet I’m still here, reading peoples’ experiences cuz it’s fun to read (but i end up freaking myself out)

Ironically, an experience I had at home was hearing a loud sigh/cough-like sound come from my brother’s bedroom (right below mine). It wasn’t him cuz he was at a friend’s house, and the sigh sounding female. I was sweating bricks the rest of the night lmao xD"
