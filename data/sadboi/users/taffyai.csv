retailhell,fr3a6f7,t3_gm8zb1,1589853070.0,While I myself have asthma and I guess could understand breathing issues making mask wearing difficult... SHOP ONLINE THEN. I went out to a store once and still wore a mask because it's not only about protecting myself but others as well. And as an essential worker (Though I can't return to work because of my lung condition and other medical immunity issues) you can't imagine how s$%# it is to have to work for barely liveable wages while nasty retail shoppers like her come in all entitled and think we WANT to be here risking our lives and health because YOU want to come in. We didn't sign up for any of this when looking for a job that barely keeps our bills paid. Come on.
MakeMeSuffer,fr39lcp,t1_fqzvxpo,1589852726.0,I'm going to urgently second this. My dad refused to take my dog to the vet for 2 years. My mom and I constantly kept saying my dog was acting weird...kinda would wobble around and had issues doing normal stuff. Eventually it got to the point where she wouldn't even eat which was abnormal because my dog had hypothyroidism and took meds for it (because it was that bad and she'd get aggressive around food.) turns out she had lyme disease from a tick and unfortunately by the time we found out it was kinda too late... vet kinda lied to us and made us believe that we could save her by basically doing dog dialysis ourselves to try to save her kidneys. Spent over $3000 trying to keep her alive only to have to put her down a month later. Was the worst thing I've had to endure with a pet. I'm still angry at my dad for refusing to believe us.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fqw8e1b,t3_gkz9z6,1589695825.0,I can 100% vouch for this. I used to frequent here a couple years ago. And all messages I got were from men who just wanted to sext or date me. Which I stated that I was not interested in at all. Unfortunately I never made a friend from here. But I would always be willing. It's sad that the sub has people like this on it. Because it ruins it for the ones like myself that genuinely want to make real life long friends.
EpicSeven,fqw7k9x,t1_fqw7agg,1589695130.0,I'm just now seeing you can do that after all this time... wow... lol thanks for your help again!
StrangerThings,fqw7dpc,t3_gkyb4m,1589694974.0,"This is actually the reason I like this show so much. Real character development. And that people we previously may not have liked are still in the show constantly changing; and not always there as a ""love interest"" to move the plot. The writers of stranger things really grasp real life I think lol"
EpicSeven,fqw76g4,t1_fqw6r1t,1589694806.0,Ah I see. Unfortunately since I had already previously used all my breath of orbis I probably won't be able to catalyst exchange unless they added a way to reset that? Probably doubtful though.
EpicSeven,fqw6re9,t1_fqw6kbv,1589694466.0,Yes thanks for your help! It got to the point where I felt really guilty not playing... lol because like I said it was my favorite for a long time. Then suddenly because I felt I was at a stand still I started to lose interest. But yeah I'll definitely look into it now that they added that. I think if I could exchange catalysts I may regain a bit of interest in it because I def have a bunch of really nice units that I saved soooo much skystone for. It'd be sad to abandon all that thank you for the help
EpicSeven,fqw6h2a,t1_fqw636l,1589694230.0,Yeah I was buying catalysts from the events and stuff but they were not having anyone that had the same ones for a long time. It's been a while since I fully leveled vildred but I just remember it took me a while. And then when I work on my other units it just seems to drag to the point of losing interest. Because I guess a giant part of the fun for me originally was being able to level them up and do PVP or try to complete the abyss. But last time I played it was just so slow I lost interest because I couldn't really do anything. I was done both stories and stuck on level 80+ of abyss and couldn't strengthen my units to pass the abyss... and got stuck into that cycle lol. Is the catalyst system really new? I had no idea that was a thing! Where do you do that? I may boot up my game and try that :)
EpicSeven,fqw62gb,t1_fqw3u39,1589693895.0,Sorry to make another comment as I read your last sentence again... lol. So the main reason it took me a year to fully level vildred is because I legit could not get the right amount of materials to fully level him. I kept running levels and they wouldn't drop at all. Like even if I left my phone on auto and let it go for the full time again and again I wouldn't come back with even 1 material. I think my main issue is the farming vs drop rates were just terrible. I don't personally think that it should be even worse than trying to pull a new unit in summoning... lol. Because I could summon and get the hero eventually. whereas a material to level up? Nah.
EpicSeven,fqw5vfn,t1_fqw3u39,1589693737.0,"So are the rates any better? Because previously I was running auto on certain areas that were the best drops for say like ""blazing souls"" I'd use all my energy and still the level wouldn't drop even 1. I guess that's my biggest concern is the wasted resources for nothing back."
EpicSeven,fqvyrit,t3_gks64k,1589688294.0,So I haven't played in about 2 months... which is sad for me as E7 was one of my favorite games for a long time. I guess I wanted to ask if the farming was better. I beat the main and new storyline. So maybe it's partially boredom (of doing everything) or what... but I felt kinda done with the game due to the lack of good farming. I picked up some other anime gacha type games and the leveling systems are so much easier and better compared. I didn't come on here to S%\^$ on the game or anything. it still holds a place in my heart but the fact that I only have 1 unit fully leveled up to max everything is kinda problematic for me. I've played pretty much since launch of global and did every event and story would try to farm things and even auto and still wouldn't receive catalysts or materials needed for leveling up. It took me 1 year to fully level vildred. I know the new E7 updates were supposed to be fixing that stuff... did it actually happen? I'd love to come back to the game but haven't been knowledgeable about if they actually fixed things yet thanks
EpicSeven,fqvydkl,t3_gl4ehh,1589688028.0,I don't even think I've touched the arena after it first debuted. I tried like 5 times and every time was a whaler with max ml\*5 units. I wouldn't even be able to attack once before basically my whole team died lol
Botchedsurgeries,fqvxufy,t1_fqvlzan,1589687667.0,Unfortunately since coronavirus I can't say things are better lol more like a big dent in my financial situation which brought many more issues up. But I'm hanging in and I hope you are too. It's definitely a bad time for everyone. And my surgery came from a burst appendix... but that year it happened was probably the worst of my life. I had become pretty sick the beginning of that year and because of that had medicals bills and then my boss fired me because of it. I then was unemployed for 3 months and then my appendix burst. So it was just bad luck after bad luck. So right before it happened I was seriously for the first time in my life considering just killing myself. Because I was feeling like no matter what I did life was against me and I couldn't get on top of it. So when I had the surgery it was like I didn't have to worry about paying my rent or where my income was coming from or about having enough money to basically survive or being homeless. I think that was the main thing that people were giving me some attention and that I felt taken care of for once. I guess when you're not used to it on a daily basis it's an amazing feeling. Even typing this I'd love to get semi sick and have to go to the hospital to relieve some stress lol. But at the same time I wouldn't want to sick either. It's a weird feeling. Glad I'm not alone in it.
Nicegirls,fqvpfy7,t1_fqvjzzp,1589682237.0,Also wanted to add I find it weird people want certain traits in a person... instead of looking for someone who naturally has them they want to force it onto someone who naturally doesn't.  Idk I find that really backwards.  Instead of admitting you're not compatible people really tend to ignore it
Nicegirls,fqvp12c,t1_fqvjzzp,1589681980.0,Right! Quirks are a bit different than expecting someone to completely change who they are to fit your needs. Its also incredibly toxic.  The bottom line is relationships are supposed to make you better and happy. Can't see anyone being better or not miserable having to adjust their whole personality to please the other person.  You'd feel incredibly resentful and not even like yourself anymore.  Its why I feel like ppl mold into 1 entity when dating and lose who they are without the other. It's so sad to watch.
Botchedsurgeries,fqvgfbr,t1_fquntx6,1589676730.0,Yeah 2 years ago I had to have emergency surgery and it was the most relaxed I think I've ever been. It didn't help that I was severely depressed and close to the edge of wanting to die. So having a bunch of people concerned for me and taking care of me made me feel important. Sometimes when I still feel really sad or that my life is crap I think about how nice it would be for me to be in the hospital again. But I also think it's partially that in the hospital I don't have to stress about paying my rent (generally because I'm not there at that moment) or affording my bills or the bad stuff in my life I'm constantly worried about.
Botchedsurgeries,fqvfzwk,t3_gkvny4,1589676469.0,That's like really sad to witness. She can barely open her one eye. I just can't imagine hating my own body to the point of doing things like this and never be happy
povertyfinance,fqvfs8h,t3_gkvadi,1589676346.0,That's awesome and smart! I inevitably have had to rely on emergency funds way too much. As a child living in poverty it was a normal thing for us to have to do. But the best advice my mother ever gave me was to always have something saved to the side in case something happens. And a couple years ago I'm glad I did. I was living on my own for the first time and unfortunately got pretty sick and my boss also decided to fire me for calling out twice. I was jobless for 3 months and unemployment never got back to me. Then my appendix burst. So I had to go in for emergency surgery and couldn't work while recovering either. If I never had saved that emergency fund I would have been homeless. Best decision I ever made.
Nicegirls,fqvfapq,t3_gl17u9,1589676052.0,No one also likes to admit that if your SO legitimately keeps flirting with other girls or crosses boundaries they KNOW you don't like... you aren't compatible! I'm not saying that behavior like this chick is OK by any means however. I just hate seeing people want relationship advice like this... I'm all for changing stuff in relationships (to the smallest extent) but asking someone to shift their behavior or who they are as a person to make YOU feel better is just wrong. Acknowledge your boundaries and if they cross them it's obviously not a good match. I always get downvoted for saying that... which baffles me. In posts where people clearly explain why it's a boundary and how they are 100% not ok with it. I guess people just want to hear what they want to hear.

It's also ridiculous because you don't want to honor your narc parent... what have they done for me that even counts as parenting? Aside from scrambling DNA to make me it's 0.

Every once and while I'd try to help her out.. ex: watch her baby for free, let her take time to apply for jobs, bought her baby some clothes, give her advice about baby care etc.  She would ALWAYS ask for more. I even gave her an $80 ring for free (It was a gift and I didn't really want it) and then 3 paintings I made for free as well. Weeks later she's bugging me to pay her phone bill and buy her gifts for her new baby. I just can't even fathom being like that. I freak out even owing people $5 until I pay it back."

vegan,fpik9fe,t1_fpewdia,1588642653.0,"Yeah I ever tried on PC and the wording is the reason I guess I was so confused. Target shows things as available for ""delivery"" and ""shipping"" which to the normal person would assume they mean the same thing; but they don't. Apparently I found out ""delivery"" means through shipt. Shipping is from their warehouse. Unfortunately looks like pretty much everything is only ""delivery."" I could pick up but again I don't want to waste my time ordering then paying for it to find out after I pick it up that they didn't have any of my stuff in stock. That's what happened with giant. I'm still waiting for them to refund me for the out of stock stuff from my order. But I'll try to maybe call them and see if they'll alert me if things I order are actually there. and My mom has ordered from [nuts.com](https://nuts.com) before we actually STILL have their big bag of turmeric from a couple years ago.

Assistance,fpijp88,t1_fpezwda,1588642318.0,"Well, I wasn't suggesting them just commenting about how if OP is looking for online stuff the surveys are way worse than the focus groups. Was actually replying to another's comment about surveys. I used to do them when I was unemployed and laying in bed after emergency surgery. I didn't really have the option not to as I had no income coming in and tons of bills I still had to pay to not be homeless. While yes it's not exactly ideal... most of the focus groups from prolific take about 1-8 mins max. The longest I did took about 10ish minutes for about $5. Not too bad considering that the survey sites pay for $0.8 for 30+ minutes of surveys (if it doesn't disqualify you before you get credited) Of course having a real paying day job is always going to be the better option. But a lot of us even more now than ever don't have the luxury to do that."
vegan,fpepgeo,t1_fpejlxs,1588552154.0,Ok I'll look into target again. I think it's the way their site it set up because their delivery options are really confusing. It wouldn't offer me anything but shipt and then only pick up for a lot of stuff.

Assistance,fpec5ov,t1_fpebg4f,1588544596.0,While I get that it's kinda true for all jobs. Most of these sites you could get by without claiming it on taxes if you earned under $500. If you earn more most companies have you claim your earnings. Then you'd need to file your own taxes. It's up to you what you want to do.
Assistance,fpeb9mz,t1_fpe8ps8,1588544073.0,I've had some luck trying to apply for online focus groups. They are really the only ones that are worth the time for money you receive. If you do the surveys most of the time you get kicked out right before finishing them and they never credit you. People online like to make it seem like you'll be rich but really it's slave labor when you think about it. Most only pay cents for 30+ minutes to 1 hour of work. Not really worth it and still pays way under minimum wage. At least focus groups generally give you over $5. I had some luck on Prolific recently. I have about $30 on there. Also people say respondent is pretty decent but I've never been picked for a focus group. Hope you find luck out there

I'm scared because I caught H1N1 when it came out. Im extremely vulnerable to any chest stuff. But your responses have been  so helpful and you really are an ""SM extraordinaire"" I truly appreciate you helping me :)"
CVS,fkl4z81,t1_fkl1l0m,1584298592.0,Yeah I went into the HR website and found a place to request time off. Idk if they'll get back to me though.  I guess I'll try to contact them again on tues. But even when I called Friday within normal business hours they didn't answer so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è either they're too busy or aren't adhering to the hours anymore idk thanks for your reply though
CVS,fkl0r57,t1_fkkzpwb,1584296004.0,Yeah at a certain point its just going to be that.  I'd prefer to get fired though so I could at least qualify for unemployment
CVS,fkkyv7w,t1_fkkyb48,1584294853.0,Yeah I saw that.  Idk if our store will be a testing store but in my county we are the worst in our whole state.  Most counties have 1 case.  We have 25. And 63 in the whole state.  I can just imagine getting sick.
CVS,fkkxnj6,t1_fkkw1rb,1584294111.0,Yes you too! I'm of course worried about paying my Bill's but cvs doesn't care.
CVS,fkkxj3g,t1_fkkxdmp,1584294035.0,I'm part time though.  Can I still request that? And where would I call? I called HR but no one answered they directed me towards an answering service and I haven't heard back
CVS,fkkxa3v,t1_fkkwssm,1584293882.0,Exactly.  I've been trying to contact them to no avail.  They keep commenting on safety got customers but not on the employees. Every CDC post has been fiercely recommending people who are vulnerable to stay home.  I bet in 2 days our cases will reach 100. At that point I just can't go in anymore. I'm just worried about being able to pay my bills long term but if they fire me I could just get unemployment possibly. I'm sure they'd try to fight it even though it's a freaking pandemic.
CVS,fkktqjn,t3_fj1bze,1584291748.0,Yes I'm in an area where it jumped from 4 cases a week 1/2 ago to 63 this morning.  My immediate county has 24 cases vs every other county only has 1. I have bad asthma and immunity issues yet I'm being forced to work. CVS has not said anything about their employees and the risk to them.  If it gets any worse I may just walk out. My life isn't worth this job where I barely get paid enough to be there.
CVS,fkiww90,t1_fkfu2w2,1584230563.0,I believe that to be true.  I still called though and left a message.  We'll see what happens... but I bet nothing.  I even got up early to try to get someone to cover the shift. Ppl are sick st every cvs in my area.
CVS,fkiwhcn,t1_fkgel2p,1584230279.0,"Yup 100% agreed. I probably won't be staying there much longer because I'm disgusted at this behavior.  I was a regular cashier when I started.  They went through 3 shifts that didn't do anything, called out almost every shift, or never showed up when scheduled. They begged me to take the promotion; and I didn't necessarily want to but figured hey I get a list raise. I literally have never called out and have covered prob 15+ shifts on my days off... never complained. God forbid I get sick and my job is threatened? Nah this job isn't worth my life. If it gets worse I'm refusing to go back."
CVS,fkg7gd6,t1_fkff438,1584151861.0,Yes I'll try calling tomorrow.  I get not having coverage for things but being rude to me for following CDC protocol is ridiculous.  And especially when they know I have asthma abs compromised immunity. I'm all for working sick within reason.  But my state went from 22 cases last night to 44 tonight.  It's not stopping and if it gets worse I will not be risking my health
Assistance,fkfmcjl,t3_fhzobo,1584137611.0,Ugh. I work in a pharmacy and literally all non-diabetics bought out ALL the alcohol prep wipes for injections. Now people that really have diabetes can't get them and it infuriates me as my nephew has type 1.
CVS,fkf98is,t1_fkf7qnf,1584129529.0,Yeah so when she called I just reiterated that I had a fever and was having chest pain and have asthma. Still got attitude but whatever. I guess if she wants to try to fire me when I've never called out before and literally cover everyone's shifts on my days off I'll find another job. No $13/he is worth my life.
CVS,fkf6vmm,t3_fi5cth,1584128241.0,Not to mention I showed up yesterday on my day off to cover for my boss and she calls me with an attitude about being sick.  What?
CVS,fim0nba,t1_filtqj1,1582515012.0,Thanks for the reply. I had no idea you weren't supposed to confront them.  I never felt comfortable doing it anyway because I really don't want someone to pull a knife or gun on me.
CVS,fillj58,t1_filjyc9,1582504420.0,Wow really? My SM literally told me to go after them and ask them to open pockets abs show receipt.  Didn't know you could get fired for that üò≥
CVS,filjp0i,t1_filjhli,1582503154.0,Oh really? My manager tells me I should try to catch them and make them show receipt or empty their pockets.  Are we not supposed to do that? I saw her get into her car and I wasn't going to knock on her door didn't want anything violent to happen.  But wasn't also 100% sure it was them until after I watched the tapes! Thank you
CVS,fi64l70,t3_f64mv9,1582178808.0,Yup I'll  be legit putting money into the register from the office or impress and with 2 signs people still try to get me to check them out. Not when I'm exchanging money through registers you can wait to buy your discounted valentine's candy üôÑ

EpicSeven,fc4l7kv,t3_efudc4,1577419944.0,Yeah honestly I thought it was me but seems everyone else is having issues too. And my units are fairly fast so it must just be a whale thing. I'll prob wait it out too if it's going to be ML full teams with amazing units. üòÇ I haven't even received 1 ML 5* unit in the whole time I've been playing.

CVS,fbmprxv,t3_eclaxg,1576987332.0,"Like others have said I don't ask every person. Especially when we're backed up a line with 10+ ppl. Just check them out and worry about it later at that point. I usually ask people if their total is $50+. I'll usually say ""has anyone told you about our new carepass?"" If that haven't I'll then ask ""do you come to cvs often? Do you get prescriptions here?"" Then explain that can get $10 off their total they get 20% off cvs brand and can get their meds mailed to them (and other stuff sometimes... Itll tell you on the app). Also explain that the first month is free they can cancel 3 days before auto-renew if they don't like it. And don't forget to say they will get $10 every month. I don't lie and say that won't get charged but if you really think about it if they come in often the carepass bucks technically pay for the membership and they still technically get $5 extrabucks leftover to spend. Then they can can decide what they want to do ü§∑ at the end of the day you asked and that's it. Nothing else can be done."
CVS,fbmnvpr,t3_edgop8,1576986554.0,Apparentally it wasn't just CVS. Customers came in saying gift cards weren't working on any online retailers...walmart in store...home depot etc. Sooo I honestly think it was a gift card issue not a CVS issue. ü§∑ I joked that it was Y2K all over again üòÇ

CVS,fbmmd1q,t3_edn5mr,1576985932.0,"Ugh literally just had one of those üòí lady legit walked in 2 mins to close. I approach her asking if she needed help. She said ""oh just last minute gift shopping. When do you guys close?"" ""In 2 mins"" ""ok idk what im looking for"" ü§î so I let her browse. Literally at 10:09 I stop and see what she's up to if she needed help. She glares at me and is like ""I DON'T NEED HELP. I KNOW WHAT I'M SHOPPING FOR. And you're making me uncomfortable."" Im like internally b@$!# you literally just said you had no idea what you were looking for. Our store is huge its 10 mins after close the f$!#ing lights shut off and you're being rude to me? I kinda was like ""ok well you didn't know what you were looking for I was checking in on you"" in a semi-rude way.

CVS,f7zqpo2,t3_dxyvko,1574114679.0,"This is from halloween when we had the BOGO free candy bags. A woman came up with 3 bags of candy. I check her out she gets the second bag for free and just stares at me. I'm like ""ok it's this much"" and she stares again. Then finally goes ""why didn't I get this (3rd bag) for free?"" ""It's buy one get one free. So you'd have to grab another bag and that one would be free or could can can put this one back and just do 2 bags"" she stares at me again for roughly 1 minute. ""Ok...but why didn't I get this bag for free?"" ""Ok see you have 3 bags. These 2 are BOGO FREE but this one needs to be 2 as well for this deal. You can just go grab another bag"" woman looks at me again. ""Whatever just forget it"" and walks out. I've never in my 26 years of life seen such dumb s!#$"
CVS,f7zpg3v,t1_f7z9v28,1574114137.0,"The hiring is awful. I had applied in say march and didn't hear back from my manager for 2 months. Filled out all.the paperwork and they called asking me to do it again 2 weeks after I did it. Then I had to wait a month for any emails to come in to even ""accept"" the job position. My manager was very honest and told me literally everything is sent over to a 3rd party that's supposed to go through background checks ands everything but they actually just make it worse not easier and she couldn't do much on her end because she doesn't have access to any of it. Even my trainer was like ""the hiring is awful""  and I still haven't received my discount card which he said may take months."

CVS,f7phbhe,t1_f7maseh,1573949332.0,"Right. And you also have to word it as a statement not a question. People frequently will say ""I'm sick can I stay home today?"" Instead of ""I can't come in today I'm sick."" For a lot of managers they see that as a ""I'm asking for permission."" Don't ask. Tell. If you're sick you're sick. ü§∑"
CVS,f7pgl35,t1_f7oq64y,1573949044.0,A better way to word it is that they aren't really spending $5/month if they're regulars or at least visit once per month because remember they get $10 EB every month. So if they use it every single month without fail it's really like they are technically gaining $5/month with the extrabucks. A lot of people hear $5/month and immediately will shut you down. Also I'd let them know the first month is free and they can cancel if they want as long as it's 3 days prior to being charged the monthly fee.
CVS,f7pg210,t3_dxajy6,1573948835.0,"Honestly you're going to get rejected almost 9/10 times. In any retail/sales environment there's always that ""subscription"" service everyone is offering. I usually wait until I see someone buying cvs brand or their bill is $40-50+ ask them ""has anyone told you about our new carepass?"" ""Right now they're giving you $10 (extrabucks) to try it out."" You can start explaining how. Def mention that you can take $10 off their transaction immediately. You can even say ""if you don't like it you can cancel it"" I reiterate that they receive $10 EB every month so they aren't really paying $5 a month as long as they're coming in and using that EB every month. Most will say no. Others will think about it. And some will say yes. But remember if you never ask you'll never get a yes."
