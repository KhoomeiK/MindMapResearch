Psychonaut,fqm8a8k,t3_gjjjso,1589473192.0,"I found this out after I had a very self-view altering high that I had using headband dab. One thing I want to quickly point out, is that dollars from dispensaries are funding a lot of specialty strains.

&#x200B;

Specifically there's a lot of investment in forgetting about the strains and focusing on the individual terpenes to create a psychedelic, calming, soothing, etc. experience.

&#x200B;

For example: myrcene, pinene, limonene.

&#x200B;

I had a really insane PTSD trigger that caused me to go mute for weeks to everyone I knew, they all thought I was dead. This was 4 weeks ago. I'm 30, single, have a good job, and live far away from anyone who's ever cared about me. I thought weed helped me, and it does, but I didn't anticipate getting a hot tiny grain of sticky headband dab (a syrup/sap type of concentrated THC) stuck in the very rear of my nose at the top of my nostril. That very potent THC then dissolved over a very long period of time in my nostril and required some good nasal cleaning later on.

&#x200B;

The trip was the most important thing that happened, because it showed me all the horrible ways I was acting towards other people out of a lack of control for my symptoms and I decided to go into a monk-like solitude before I can fully open myself back up to immediate communication. Around the same time I had exchanged messages with someone and was reading on this sub, and realized that I have been having very subliminal cognitive training playing itself out in a lot of my life situations. I don't know if I interact with people sanely, insanely, etc.

&#x200B;

I turned my phone off that day and deactivated my facebook, and honestly don't even know where the phone is - I might go off of having a phone forever after this. It feels like my mind is moving at ""everyone else's"" pace for once, and I'm going to practice more meditation before I try to meet the golden teacher in a few weeks."

You mention in the post that your trauma is directly tied to your music. Mine also specifically affected my ability to sit and play music for extended periods of time. I started  playing again last fall after 13 years after being unable to play music after a long bout of trauma - a kid who played 6 instruments at the time. Worked with a good psychiatrist, learned about SUDS, and did an intensive outpatient Dialectical Behavioral Therapy program which trains your responses to cognitively distorted thoughts. Zen Meditations would probably also eventually train your mind to move past the heavier thoughts associated with that area. After maybe 4 months of constant pushing I kind of broke through a barrier that let me finally look at the musical situations differently, and be able to create new content rather than just rehashing playing styles I'd developed earlier.   


You clearly are a very capable person, it's awesome how you've pulled together APIs and transposal methods for generating the accompaniment - I mess with similar music (maybe). This video is only a few days ago, and is great, it goes pretty heavy into some generative music styles [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASruOUG2HIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASruOUG2HIs). When I was on disability music was pretty much the only thing that got me through a long period of days, but it was also substituted as a way to not work on my issues for awhile longer and not job search. I do believe that enjoying music as a fulfilling activity done on your free time is a great idea, but for me was almost as triggering as dating and required a lot of outside clinical help before i could return to it fully. Starting small and going from there was full of bumps but was mostly consistent, and my music got better as my mental health did too.   


In my own feelings of worthlessness, perfection is probably the most brutal pursuit lined with cognitive distortions. But, when that's the case, figuring out how to tow the line between perfection and improving something is the key element. By reexposing myself to the troubling environment (music) and learning the DBT skills so I could handle distress and reframe my troubling thoughts, I was able to make music again. I'm still nowhere near where I want to be, but simply playing without pain is an act of courage that's good enough (for now). I think the same could be possible for you too. Here's something I was making right before I commented on this: [https://send.firefox.com/download/f409617129cd804b/#fgi4fkV9M6bWR1mod58ZJg](https://send.firefox.com/download/f409617129cd804b/#fgi4fkV9M6bWR1mod58ZJg)"

First off, this is sad. You don't respect her right to have her own opinions and choose what kind of people she wants in her life or not, that's not for you to decide - that's not how libertarians are supposed to act.

Second, you told her you have a degree (I'm assuming a Bachelor's) in economics as a reason to display why you were right and she was wrong. It doesn't matter who is right or wrong, it's simply not effective for getting to know someone on the first few dates. Moreover, you basically told her ""calm down"" or why her opinion was invalid by bragging about your degree as a way to silence her criticism. Complaining about it as a liberal problem is just sad.

Third, you put her down and then you're still trying to get affection at the end of the night. Instead of respecting her choice to choose like a good libertarian, you run to the internet like a 4chan/8chan incel and put her down for not showing you physical affection. It's her bloody choice, pal. You don't deserve anything that she doesn't choose to give you.

Lastly, no you didn't ""pretty much just laugh it off"", you got neckbeard-levels hurt and wrote an emotional post on a politics sub to intimate that the herr-derr-liberal scourge is affecting your ability to get laid. Meanwhile you take no responsibility for simply not having acted in a fuckable way. You're being an incel, and it's gross.

Based on what you're describing, I think it would benefit you to look at the TIPP skills from the Distress Tolerance pillar of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. Specifically, Temperature, Paced Breathing, Paired Muscle Relaxation I think would be best for you.

&#x200B;

I would highly recommend trying to adopt TIPP as a first step, and then take it from there. I would also highly recommend avoiding responding to these situations by using drugs that have a tendency to keep us out of the moment, and persist hours longer after the trigger has affected us.

Being self-employed takes a lot of work to get it off the ground, I'm not saying you won't, but I am saying that the prework to do it will exceed the amount of financial runway you currently have.

CPTSD,eqrt9we,t3_bzdqln,1560269350.0,"I think one thing at a time... For one, you probably won't accomplish being self employed AND getting out of a job that's triggering you AND working in your triggers at the same time. You know this, I'm not criticizing you, but I want to point it out with a suggestion. You CAN be self employed and you CAN get out of jobs you don't like much IF you start taking pragmatic steps to work on the triggers in your jobs and daily life. It sounds like you are focusing on a lot of things, as we do as we are anxious, but if you focus on ONLY a few specific daily triggers with your ultimate goals in mind then you can work towards them. Sounds like you need to find a job and work on ways to hold onto it while being okay. I will make one side comment though, that in some ways the desire to rush to be self employed might be interpreted as a desire to isolate yourself from other people. Sometimes isolation can create an internal echo chamber that allows us to become more likely to act out in a way that embraces our less helpful habits. In your new job, maybe you should try one thing. Have lunch with a co-worker everyday, do your hardest to never immediately react to something within less than 24-48 hours, do meditation three times each week during lunch. These are just some thoughts, I hope they're helpful. I understand what you're going through, I go through something similar myself.

I have the Pete Walker book and would have to sit at Panera for 5 hours to get through a few dozen pages. I also got the Kindle version and could get Alexa to read it to me but then it was too easy to freeze out. But at this point I feel like I have no tools and psychiatry isn't helping so I know I need tools.
CPTSD,eqf5gdm,t1_eqekjhk,1560015440.0,"Thanks. Been spiraling hard since week 3, trying to stabilize.. what's ECT?"

CPTSD,eqcext9,t3_by2izx,1559968052.0,"I'm 5 weeks of 6 in to TMS currently. It gave me a little bit if a boost first two weeks and third week I nose dived due to a wave off environmental triggers... Someone hit my car and lied about how it happened, disagreement with roommates, unable to get a new job, things like that. So many triggers right now I'm doing very badly, even started drinking again. I have a little bit more energy now but it just has not been very effective for me. I also didn't realize this but people who get TMS generally get it again after several years. 

It's worth noting it is a major depressive disorder treatment and for insurance to cover it you generally have to demonstrate you've tried at least four different medications which have not worked. 

Even within the first two weeks where I had a small boost I was still getting triggered regularly."
