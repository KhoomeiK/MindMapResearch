Spinach is 6 bucks for a tiny bag, frozen its 3.50 so i usually get that even though it's a lot less volume. Celery is like 5 bucks. Strawberries can be 10 bucks for a tiny box same for blueberries and raspberries. I just spent 25 bucks on about 750g of frozen fruit ;-; asian fruits like magoes and bananas and dragon fruit and stuff are super high cal so fml i guess. Diet coke is cheap here though."

And I am so so sorry to hear about your dad. It must be hard for him but also for you to see such a strong figure in your life struggle with day to day life. With the girl, there were ones before her and there will be ones after her. Trust me when I say any girl in the world would be absolutely blessed to be with such a strong thoughtful and empathetic man like yourself. I too struggle with mental health issues such as depression and suicidal thoughts, and from what I’ve heard, it gets better. I know that sounds overplayed but it really does. If I were you I’d talk to a professional though.

You are an attractive guy. There is absolutely nothing wrong with your face whatsoever and I hope you are not insecure about it. Take care love <3 stay strong :)"
