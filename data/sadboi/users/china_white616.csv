EDAnonymous,fpurj7t,t1_fpu8q7z,1588921298.0,Yess it's the worst and can't focus on anything! Almost as though the room won't stay still. so glad :) I hope you feel better soon!
EDAnonymous,fpu849n,t3_gewbbe,1588906742.0,"I have hypoglycaemia too and had to figure this out after my BSL dropped to 1 while I was sleeping when I was younger, not fun!! I try and notice if I start to feel vertigo/heart palpitations for no reason I know I need some sugar, so I keep barley sugars and the single wrapped starburst next to my bed/in the freezer/in my bag just incase and I find having just 1 sugar in my cups of tea really helps when I feel I'm crashing, it can be so hard to juggle at times when the ED is very loud, but I find that the tiny sugar spike helps me think alot more rationally and clearer too :) sorry if that was rambly I hope you get it under control soon"
EDAnonymous,fpu0ewf,t1_fpt5yrf,1588902009.0,"This! For me is so accurate 
Its like my brain has accepted the fact I'll never see myself as conventionally attractive or have a fulfilling life so it's my safety blanket while I live vicariously through other people and obsess on my ED 
Sometimes I have good weeks, but this is like my default setting, never feeling like I'll be good enough and than feeling silly for being so ungrateful,  helpless for not being able to change the thought pattern no matter how much therapy I do and wanting to hide from everyone"
EDAnonymous,fpqw3rn,t3_fzrfjh,1588833996.0,"This happened to me when I was on methadone, I honestly think most of it was water weight from being constipated all the time and my body slowing down because it was more relaxed even if I didn't always feel it mentally lol.

EDAnonymous,fppj2x5,t3_fxxgqk,1588803201.0,"Yess ,I make a list of all the foods Ive had fixations on but to scared to eat. Prep it all, restrict and get high before I eat. End up doing this like a few times a month, it's not healthy but so much better than trying and failing constantly"

I hate myself to much to get better, all Ive done with my life is cycle in and out of hospital and detox. Clean now but can't kick ED and I'm ""to complex for treatment"" even tho when I was younger they would have sectioned me 5kg ago and tubed me for refeeding. It doesn't make sense and I feel so alone I just want my heart to stop. I've ruined so much of myself trying to deal with this disorder and had so many overdoses that I just ended up in ICU, I honestly feel to guilty to ask for help too because I know how hard I can be to treat and feel so much guilt taking up even more recourses. Sorry for depressing post I come on here most days and just reading everyone else vent helps alot. Just needed to vent today. I hope your all going ok ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤"

I am constantly in a spiral of ""I need to be more social I'm waisting my life and a waist of space"" than push myself to be social, even just hop on social media, but as soon as I do even if only for a minute, I'm left for DAYS paranoid and obsessing/scrutinising over every single word I said said/typed and even what I could have possibly typed and I have to isolate for days just to be able to think/be out of that whirlwind of anxiety and intrusive thoughts, that literally blossom from nothing logical or things that happened years ago!!
