Just because they're screaming sexism doesn't mean they rep all of Warren's voters; many have already started choosing bernie in the polls...

Just because Warren won a small percentage of lib fem votes does not mean her supporters are all one and the same. Without liberal feminism, we wouldn't have achieved a lot of the rights we have as women. I hope us cancerous liberal feminists get so far up your but you get anal cancer."

Warren supporters don't give a shit because they probably don't even see the damage it's causing with their own eyes.  And any woman group that wants to push a woman into the presidency, just so we can say we've had a vagina in the white house, is a sexist herself. Don't you think I want a woman president? Yes, I do. But I have bigger priorities right now, like fixing the damn country so that people aren't dying from lack of healthcare or rationing insulin. So that we don't have single mothers have to choosing between gas and food. So we don't have seniors being evicted from their houses and being denied basic support services. So that people w/out pensions or big 401k matches can actually retire.  Must I got on. A vagina is way down on the bottom of that list of things I care about changing immediately"

They are not regulated the same way a service agency non-profit is. I can't even tell you how much money we spent on audits over the years when orgs like the Clinton Foundation hadn't passed an audit in 5+ years."
science,ff3mjrr,t3_erbe12,1579544243.0,"I worked at a senior service organization raising money for more than 5 years.  The seniors we worked with were poor, vulnerable, and many were homebound. Many would only eat half of their meals on wheels so they could save some for later.  The county had cut meals on wheels by 50% for a couple years, pushing our organization into losing over $1 a meal leading to a deficit of over 300k each year. POLITICIANS DON'T CARE IF YOU STARVE. That is what i learned working there."
