My looks, my personality, my weight, height, in general my body was the perfect target for them. It made me isolate myself in my room in my free time because no one bullied me there, which led me to being socially awkward. At that point i knew that my chances of living alone forever are really high. My whole teenage was just one big blur and i have nothing to look back at. I now have a job, a nice car, i make my own money, more than my former bullies do, but i'm still a loner and a loser.

I really felt that when you said girls were disgusted when they had to sit next to me, i know that feeling. I don't know how to talk to women, i have zero experience. I'm afraid of online dating, i'm afraid to go to a bar alone, as i know my former bullies will be there, i'm beginning to lose hope. I'm underweight, i have the voice of a robot and the personality of a stone. I have physically harmed myself on purpose too. I don't want to admit it to myself, but maybe i really am destined to be lonely and depressed too as life has taught me. I wish someone would just walk into my life and make everything right and love me for who i am and all of my faults. But that won't happen. I'm currently seeing a therapist but honestly it's not making any difference to my mood or life. There is a chance that i will be put on antidepressants too which makes me realize how low i have sunk in my life. I feel like my life has hit a dead end too, and i have my whole life ahead of me, and i don't want it to continue like this, i'd rather have it end right here right now.
