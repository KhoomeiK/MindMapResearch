conlangs,ey5lieb,t3_cvena8,1566834582.0,"A couple other examples:

* Pama-Nyungan languages typically have four complete series of coronal consonants contrasted along the lines of laminal/apical and 'front'/'back'', or in distinctive feature theory, roughly \[±distributed\] and \[±anterior\]. Much more oddly, they virtually universally have no (phonemic) fricatives or voicing/phonation contrast at all, anywhere, period. (Kalaw Lagaw Ya is the only exception I am aware of.) Proto-Pama-Nyungan apparently had a *fifth* coronal plosive.
* Proto-Dravidian seemed to be near identical in this regard, but the two families otherwise show no signs of a relationship.

Also, I'm surprised no one has mentioned PIE yet."
