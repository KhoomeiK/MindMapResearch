JapanTravel,f53dixw,t3_dmit6y,1571958781.0,"Hi, I too am traveling to Japan on those dates. I was wondering why you haven't included any on the western areas(kyoto, osaka, hiroshima)?"
JapanTravel,f538dr3,t1_f515cbz,1571957296.0,Thanks for the suggestions & tips. And also thanks a lot for the tip about the potato chips & popcorn. I definitely wouldn't have thought of that!
JapanTravel,f537b8i,t1_f50ovt0,1571956989.0,Thanks. I will definitely have a look!
JapanTravel,f53790u,t1_f50fz7u,1571956963.0,Thanks for your suggestion about Hakone. You are right about the JR pass. It makes complete sense to take the JR pass for those 7 days.
JapanTravel,f5364x3,t1_f52ke9n,1571956647.0,"Thanks for the reply,   
So yes, it is not pointless after computing the prices of my overall transport. I will take the 7-day pass in Hakone. I think I get the most value with that."

Thanks for the link. I have actually done some online therapy but both the times I received some cliche advice like think positive, appreciate what you have, write a journal etc. I have tried some of it but again never solves my underlying problem."
depression,f2fanmr,t1_f2dk2u8,1570214099.0,You are right. I am also scared that many of them will just give some cliche advice about what to do that I can just read up on the internet.
depression,f2fai9c,t1_f2cxhjn,1570214018.0,"Thanks for your reply.  


I agree there is a lot to explore and all but I just don't find a sense of purpose in most things I do nowadays."
depression,f2d1cos,t3_dck8hr,1570145507.0,"Yes, I daydream all the time. When I listen to music, I dream about being a great musician. When I meet a charming girl I keep dreaming about being in a relationship with her although I won't talk to her again. When I see someone doing something cool or read about some badass character, I dream that I am that person. And when the dream gets over bam! A strong dose of depression hits seeing how pointless my life is.

Because we hate ourselves and/or our situations a lot of things can trigger these daydreams. I am also looking for a solution to this problem."
IOT,f18ggpq,t3_d82g7s,1569257407.0,"From the top of my head - Put your phone/iPad & all other electronic devices that distract you at one corner of the room. Have a raspberry pi connected with a motion sensor and speaker near that corner. Let the raspberry pi make some jarring noise when you try to fetch your devices at times when you are supposed to be working.

Not exactly ""Internet"" of things. Maybe you can add a logger to log every time you go near those devices. Its a really simple project. If you want a more challenging/complex one you can make a smart mirror:
