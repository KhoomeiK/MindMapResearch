But then whenever I have the chance to end my life again tell myself I need to do it this time, because I know no matter how much I believe my life will get better it won't and I need to end it. But my subconscious always tells me not to, then afterwards I end up regretting it when I realize my life still won't get better, then the cycle repeats. 

I hate it."

TransyTalk,fojips8,t3_g7sq06,1587821983.0,"That's actually a really good way to put it. Personally, finding out I'm trans was both scary and relieving for me. Personally I never felt like I was living my own life, I always felt like I was living someone else's, and so I just wouldn't care about my life. 

Realizing I'm trans made me really happy knowing I had a life to care about, but after time it started just becoming depressing. I'm missing out on my whole childhood, I have to deal with the problems and complications that come with being trans, I can't even begin transitioning anytime soon, and knowing all those things just made me more depressed. 

But I think the way you put it is a lot better than mine. That our lives don't have to be the way we thought they'd turn out, they can be better, and we can just be who we want to be. That's a lot nicer way to think about it and I like that interpretation. 

I'm really sorry if I sounded weird or depressing in this comment, I just seen this post and I related to it a lot and I felt like talking."

Actually that just sounds like r/woooosh.

Fuck.
