pathfindermains,fqlxrjy,t3_gjmvu1,1589467998.0,"I'm praying for 25 sec mid season buff. I just can't play him anymore, I'm happy to admit I'm not good enough at the game to make him work with low profile and that hitbox. I'm honestly glad I agree with you so much too, ifyagetme? I've played him since season 1 and don't want to feel I'm being petulant, but I always thought I played like a scout, as a tactician rather than just the best gunfighter. winning fights with strategy not just skill, and I just can't anymore. I wonder if the nerf was particularly with competitive in mind, as his supply beacon and the team movement is far more important at that level."
pathfindermains,fqlxcn2,t1_fqla5va,1589467789.0,"Bro I get your point I think entirely but wouldn't all of that have still applied if it was 25secs, and then he would still be playable repositioning within a fight. Loba would still be an option alternative, she doesn't just have mobility but team support as well. She has an awesome passive with finding gold loot on drop and her ult is great for both late game, shield swap, etc. All.petitioner does is move himself or a team. His whole point is a mobile scout! It feels like an incredible overreaction. I'm just praying they have done it deliberately to boot off the uncommitted and they'll buff him back to some intermediate mid season."
pathfindermains,fqlw5a0,t1_fqll6al,1589467172.0,I just keep getting fried in one on ones without the ability to use positioning to my advantage. I'll readily admit my reaction time isn't the most spectacular and I was relying on strategy to play well. Much harder when all you can do is run most of the time. At the very least Wraith gets a warning of aiming (passive) plus a smaller hitbox for what seems like the same nerf. It's so much sacrifice it feels just to have a zipline. I really need to stop being so salty but man I'm struggling!

Mental health and the labels associated are better understood as ways of explaining people (brains) that aren't functioning along socially agreed expectations of being human. We all agree not killing yourself is a good thing but if we didn't, say like you countless civilisations across time, it wouldn't be a symptom. I have depression, my brain doesn't work either, it's my default state. I have the symptomology of bipolar, yet only when under extreme stress. What would help about pretending I have a lifelong disease? Your far more than just your problems obviously, but would you have an issue of I called you a plumber say, defining your entire existence by the job you may detest and place no identification in.
