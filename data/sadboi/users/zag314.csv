Mom, so there’s been a lot on my mind since Sunday. It’s still eating me up inside. I can’t understand how a mother could take concern from her daughter and twist it to justify saying cruel words. I’m an adult and those words stick. I feel I should have said Ganorga; would that have stopped you from attacking me?

If a future relationship is desired it will require remediation before I can trust being around you again. I know this is difficult to read. It’s hard to write with the thought of your interpretations and I really hope it’s taken as me being hurt by someone that is supposed to love them.
