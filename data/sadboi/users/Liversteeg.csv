IAmA,fqm78ui,t3_gjosrb,1589472693.0,"I have been diagnosed with insomnia and am prescribed 100 mgs of Trazadone for sleep. 

Is there any sleep disorders that involve persistent and intense night terrors in adults? Sometimes I wake up screaming. I talk in my sleep (according to my partner) and I’m usually distressed or angry and often yelling things about needing help. He says they are pretty coherent statements and he helps wake me up when it happens. 

This has been going on for years now and it’s worsened my insomnia because I’m afraid of sleeping sometimes. 

This could be more of a psychological problem, but I figured I’d ask. 

Thank you!"
AskReddit,fq25a0x,t3_gge8dn,1589052955.0,"God we had tragic deaths yearly at my high school. 

The summer going into freshman year of high school, one of my classmates died from hyperthermia. He was riding on an ATV or something with his dad and it broke down. They each only had one small bottle of water and had to hike back. His dad couldn’t get through to 911 and had to hike to a ranger station to get help to get his sons body. His mom became my PE teacher so it was tense. It made me scared and sad. 

Also in high school, a girl a few years older than me accidentally drove off a cliff. She was in her car getting high with friends at an overlook area at the beach. Thought she was in reverse and drove forward. Worst part is her friends jumped out quickly out of fear and it threw off the balance and the far fell. 

One classmate I had gone to school with since 4th grade was shot and killed the year after we graduated while trying to buy a laptop off craigslist. His girlfriend was with him. It was awful. 

The classmate I was the closest with out of all these tragedies, also died the year we graduated. He worked for a legit firework company and was helping unload a truck when one randomly began to go off. His coworker tried to throw it away from them but it rolled under the truck he was standing on, full of fireworks. He suffered burns on ~80% of his body. His nerve endings were so burned he kept telling his parents that was going to be okay. He died two days later from infection. 

Most of these just made me sad and scared to the point where I still think about them anytime I go to the desert and bring extra water, or parked next to a cliff, or meeting up with internet strangers. I’m not blaming them at all, it just scared wisdom into me at a young age."

Summer - early fall we do a copper based red, winter to early spring it is a darker and more purple based red. I don’t fully remember how the numbers work, but I’m usually a 646 for lighter reds and a 666 for the vibrant/true reds. 

My natural hair color is more of a bland dirty blonde so the vibrant reds fade nicely to more of an Auburn. We intentionally dye it shades that fade in a natural-esk manner because of the expensive upkeep of red. I usually go 6-8 weeks before needing it re-dyed. The picture on the left is also my hair REALLY needing a wash so it’s an extreme example but yeah, for the most part it fades nicely!

AmItheAsshole,f75dyud,t3_duaufo,1573414184.0,"YTA. It’s standard practice for restaurants to have specials that are dine-in only. We do this for our happy hour special. There’s a few reasons behind this: minimizing people taking advantage, if you’re seated it’s likely you will spend more money, etc. Regardless, it’s the policy. As a server it is so hard when you tell a guest something like this and they push you on it and challenge it “well why is this the policy?” “Why can’t I just x, y and z?” Like I didn’t make the rules man, I’m just telling you them. People always think they are the exception to the rule or are going to make a point that will make me go “OH! You’re right! Sure. Do what you want.”  

That server probably did get a decent amount of shit from management for letting you do that. When you try to wiggle around policies, it can put others risk of being reprimanded."

It’s not like I’m sending the photo to strangers or posting it on the internet and shaming her. I sent it to her boyfriend that she lives with to give concrete evidence of the affair. 

Did I send a nude photo of a woman to her boyfriend? Yes. Is it anything he hasn’t seen before? Hopefully not. 

If you want privacy, don’t send nudes in the first place. And especially don’t send them to a married man who’s wife pays the phone bill. 

I was on the fence before but the more I discuss it, she doesn’t deserve privacy and neither does he. People are acting like I’m plastering an intimate photo of her all over the place. Nah, I sent her bf a relatively chill nude that she sent to her married boss. 

Worse things could happen..... I’d be more concerned about the wife having the photo than me.

Edit:
Okay it’s fucked of me to say that about the nudes. Y’all are right that her sending it doesn’t mean they should be sent to others. I honestly don’t feel that what I did was that big of an invasion of privacy. I sent it to her boyfriend as proof of her infidelity. I didn’t think he would believe a random internet person without some evidence. He’s seen her naked before. I didn’t post it on the internet or send it to anyone else. I’m not publicly shaming her.

I’ve since deleted it and don’t plan on spreading it. My (probably misguided) hope was that it would stop her from making it more public, because that was the initial plan.
