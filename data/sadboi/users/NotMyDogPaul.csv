I said well why don't you say something like drop a little hint that you'd be okay with it? She was like ok good idea. I heard the rest of the story from her son because when he was in the room the next time she told him ""you know, I heard that homosexuals are really good at math and I think that's great and they deserve happiness"" amd he just said ""thanks mom"" I guess all parents can be a bit awkward with their gay kids but as long as their heart's in the wrong place I guess that's what counts.

I have a feeling that the Rona made people think a bit harder about whether or not they wanna work in healthcare. Before this, for a lot of people, the prospect of a pandemic has always been abstract at most, if the thought even crossed their mind. But now it's something very real that they have to kind of reckon with. Like yes this is an actual dangerous line of work. Then again for others it might be a real call to arms. But that's just speaking to the competitive nature. From what I understand,  RT programs are less impacted than nursing programs. Both fields require similar character traits and since taking care of the sick is your thing, you have a good start. With nursing you have more opportunities. But with rt you have a much deeper knowledge and skill set. Its very specialized. And you still have a decent amount of opportunities."
