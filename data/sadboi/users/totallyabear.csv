huntersbell,fm1ch8j,t3_fsfy4f,1585675923.0,Alright. I‚Äôll ring my bell when I get there.

After reading your story I see someone who is dealing with the things that are stopping them from achieving that happiness they are looking for - whatever that may be will click with you on this journey.

Kudos to you for finally seeking out that help but do not think for a moment that this was your last chance at receiving help. This pandemic will pass and you will find the help you need when it does. Stay strong and try to use whatever tools or revelations that you walked away with to your advantage. Just remember that every morning, in fact at any time of the day, it is a chance to start or continue along your path of getting better. Just takes things 1 small step at a time and never ever forget to just look up. Please reach out if you need to talk to anyone because this is a tough time we are experiencing right now. 

Much love."

I can‚Äôt help but smile and poorly bop around every time I watch it. As Latrice says, ‚ÄúThat is what a lip sync for your life is, baby. That is high drag at its finest.‚Äù Definitely a good choice for showing people what a lip sync can be.

Also, I‚Äôm pretty sure she introduced me to what a leg is that day. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôve been walking on all my life but I can definitely say that they pale in comparison."

deadbydaylight,eqq6a4g,t3_byy35g,1560213218.0,"Since the game doesn‚Äôt really have a ‚Äúcasual‚Äù mode, it made the whole ranking system feel less like a hindrance to me.

I used to avoid ranked games in the past because it‚Äôs never fun to know that you suck. 

Just go into every match looking to learn something, whether you‚Äôre a killer or a survivor, and don‚Äôt worry too much about the rank/points. 

Maybe go into one survivor match looking to get chased by the killer so you can work on your jukes. As killer, you can work on your head games, positioning, and recognizing whether or not that‚Äôs a player or a bush you‚Äôre looking at. 

You‚Äôll get better in no time and see yourself inching up the scoreboard with every passing game."
deadbydaylight,eqc1rye,t3_by2u97,1559960758.0,This happened to me earlier. I just shut it down and reset everything and it sorta fixed things. Games are still taking a bit longer to get but they at least connect now.
