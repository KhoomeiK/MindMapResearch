BPD,fkc155y,t3_fhhwvo,1584043764.0,"Yeah, I have no friends which sometimes is ok but I know I did this to myself. I've only recently noticed that I will push people away when I feel that they will leave me or that I become cold to them so then when I leave or they leave it wont be so bad. Soo anyway that was sad but yeah I dont have any friends. To be honest the last friends I had were from school and people naturally drift from their school friends anyway."

BPD,ff8mu8f,t3_es4b8r,1579686424.0,"I've done this ever since I can remember, probably for the same reason to be honest. Sometimes I accidentally do it in public too because my brain just forgets where I am. Good to know I'm not the only one who does it though!"
