mentalhealth,flzt4cf,t3_fs73xm,1585632750.0,"hi! i would look into getting some melatonin tablets from your local store. most places will have them in either gummies, small tablets (i recommend the 5mg strawberry flavored and take three bc it helps me when i can’t sleep, and take those three an hour before you are planning on going to bed. then make sure you’re laying in bed with the lights off during that time, sound minimal, and have a glass of water nearby if you need it. watch a tv show you like, and when you feel the melatonin kicking in, start to drift off then right before falling asleep turn off the tv and go to bed. that’s what i do :)"

depression,feyi8rn,t3_eqs4h8,1579445886.0,"I go through phases of times where I’ll feel like there’s nothing wrong like, at all. Like I’ll feel like I have nothing wrong with me, despite having cut three days ago and wanting to every day, I still feel.. normal. And then it goes back down but while I feel normal I feel like nothing from the past 6 months has been real and I’ve been faking it and because of that I don’t want to get better because I want to prove to myself I didn’t make everything up. Is anyone like this?"

I feel so weird Bc if I look away, I feel like nothing happened and I’m normal, Bc I’m so used to hiding my feelings and pretending, my own head believes I’m just fine and so now I’m constantly thinking I’m crazy for pretending to feel this way when it’s obviously real I just... plz tell me someone gets this?"
