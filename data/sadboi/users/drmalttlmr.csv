depression,fqy82ua,t3_glka4u,1589744201.0,"Same. Every thing in life scares me somehow, big or small. Even as a child, thought things would get better or fall in the right place and time as an adult. I’m just too sensitive and insecure for this world, can’t even name a single thing I’m proud of. No goals in life. Mainly because I hope I won’t have to live this life any day longer, I’ve been focusing on that for so long. I feel like I’m not living this life for myself, it constantly feels like I’m surviving. Pretending to be a bubbly, content and happy person. Doing what society tells me to do, hate this system so much. You’ll get rejected if you’re slightly different then others. I’m having suicidal thoughts for months now. I feel like it’s too late and I failed so many times in life. :("

SuicideWatch,fqhpufa,t1_fqhp509,1589381983.0,"Tbh there’s sadly nothing that interests me anymore. For now I just like to sleep so time passes by quick, meanwhile wishing that I just want to stop existing. ;( I’m so tired to pretend everything is okay. Can’t do it anymore."

SuicideWatch,fqg8jfh,t3_giju3t,1589340287.0,My thoughts exactly. I’m sorry that you are dealing with this as well. Life can be so hard. 😔
AvPD,fqdpyb0,t3_gi071y,1589294533.0,"Same here. It’s the only thing I desire to do when I get home from work. Currently laying in my bed, blinds closed, my dog laying next to me and listening to some music. I both hate and love it. It just feels like a safe place but at the same time gives me anxiety because it reminds me that there are others stuff I might have to do or have to work on to improve my life. Kinda lost all the motivation so it’s the only thing I do whenever I can .."
SuicideWatch,fq5t3zk,t3_ggtnxa,1589116731.0,Same :(

socialskills,fpstjuu,t3_gezm1t,1588879381.0,This fucking depression is making me feeling miserable but also mad about everything. I was feeling like this before the whole virus thing but it’s gotten worse and worse omg. Don’t want to deal with friends or people in general and I keep ignoring them or answering a few days later. And those fucking zoom invitations is just not what I want to deal with right now wtf I don’t have anything to talk about just want to cry and die. I just want to disappear from this shitty world.
SuicideWatch,fpst53b,t3_gf8fyq,1588879184.0,"I’m always ‘glad’ whenever I read these posts, it makes me realize I’m not the only one who is like this. Fucking hate this feeling and I can completely understand it. Feel like I can’t even function like a normal person anymore wtf."
SuicideWatch,fpsss99,t3_gf8fgf,1588879008.0,"And people say this feeling is ‘temporary’ .. shit I’ve been feeling like this for over ten years and really just want to end it so bad. Can’t deal with this anymore, I’m not living just existing."

SuicideWatch,fmhaels,t3_fuygxq,1586072303.0,"Everyday, yes. I really just wish there was a reset button. Ofc it’s not possible so the only solution that haunts me is that I want to end it all. This idea is haunting me for many years and I’m getting used to it."
SuicideWatch,fcv065l,t3_eiq4yk,1577991972.0,Same. I get so angry and especially sad when I look at old photographs when I was this happy kid. I’m so done and disappointed with this life D:

depression,fadl9b5,t3_e8m9to,1575977456.0,"You just perfectly described how I feel. It’s exhausting.. I want to stop existing. I don’t want, need, deserve happiness anymore. There’s something holding me back idk, maybe the fear of hurting certain people. But I just can’t deal with this anymore ;("
depression,f9d322q,t3_e4gtin,1575229703.0,"Yes exactly! Life’s just unfair in general. I didn’t ask to be on this shitty world that’s trying to break us down. I feel like I don’t belong here .. tired for always having to pretend that everything is going well, just so that I don’t hurt anybody. But this is my life and I really want to disappear, just go to sleep and never wake up ;( idk if that’s too much to ask for"

SuicideWatch,f40s3nm,t1_f40ozoh,1571306489.0,"Not anymore. I think it’s too late for that .. everything is so difficult and no one might understand. Friends don’t care and the family is giving me this strong feeling like I can’t do nothing right. I’ve had therapy for a few years .. they didn’t help at all if I think about it. In fact, I feel like I’m back at the beginning and feeling even worse. I don’t know but, is it weird that I don’t even want to seek for help anymore or talk about it in general?"
