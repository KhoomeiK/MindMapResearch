But NOOOOOOO, he had to be a glory whore and make people chant his name before he finally killed him. Nonsense. The whole movie is Maximus trying to be a rockstar before he died.

A pox on that movie."

Pennsylvania,fkpsfwz,t1_fkps5p8,1584418084.0,Honestly...  small town bar people.  That's the answer. They're small town people who have nothing but bars and churches to visit. And the churches are still open. Why shouldn't my spirits still be available?
