schizophrenia,fp1xa1r,t3_ganka5,1588250315.0,"I felt this way too, i thought my voices were like everyone else's other side, that they would say things to your face and there would be this other world where everyone would talk telepathically but I wasn't allowed because everyone hated me and if I ever spoke about the voices to people the voices would no longer just be in my head and people would turn on me to my face. Made me keep quiet about it for 2 years until I had no hope left and eventually told my mum and the Dr and I only spoke about it because I was on the verge of killing myself and thought I'd tell someone and if they did turn on me then I would just kill myself. Thank god I did tell my mum and the Dr as my whole life changed and I found out it was all in my head and none of it was real."
schizophrenia,ffcgcy6,t3_estq8j,1579798869.0,"They make me feel high when I take them and I take them before bed. About half an hour after taking them the sedative effect kicks in and if I'm not asleep by about an hour the hunger starts and I feel like I'm starving and have on many occasions ate a lot of packets of crisps while half asleep. I can't be 100% sure about how tired they make me as I've just been diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and waiting on my app for my mask so I'm tired all the time but it's probably because of that. They are the only drug that's worked and given me my life back but they did take about 8 months to properly work and stop the voices. Haven't heard them in 5 years now and I've lowered my dose from 450mg to 300mg over the years. Very highly addictive if on them long term, if I miss a dose I don't feel like I'm in my own body and have this horrible feeling of dread but I rarely forget them as i can't sleep without taking them."

schizophrenia,f33isnf,t3_dfbk3f,1570639369.0,I was put on this first and my breasts grew about 3 sizes and my feet swelled up. My prolactin levels went through the roof and my body thought I was pregnant. I was quite pleased to have huge boobs but then my doctor asked me if i started leaking yet and I was like yeah change these meds.
tifu,f2ez4kg,t1_f2e4wdi,1570206877.0,Yeah I wouldn't be happy about it. I've got schizophrenia and even being on the best meds and not experiencing hallucinations weed basically sends me to hell with hallucinations and being in a room full of people I'd end up freaking out and have a panic attack. With meds I am a completely rational and grounded person but it just takes just a few tokes to make me into a delusional wreck believing I'm in a room full of demons or aliens etc.
schizophrenia,f0q1oma,t1_f0org5o,1568852209.0,Yeah that shit sends me to hell to the point I think I'm talking to a demon that's the person with me and even the people on the TV will say shit and make eye contact with me. Amplifies it for me 1000%
schizophrenia,f0q1bp9,t3_d5ua4m,1568852002.0,"I adored weed and smoked it almost every day in my teens which I think triggered the schizophrenia. Now when I even take one toke voices X1000, can't speak and I'm sitting there in crippling fear. I find it scary how close schizophrenia is to me and how my delusions can come back in an instant."
schizophrenia,f0pvj63,t3_d60ixa,1568848465.0,"Actually this has kind of happened to me when I think of it. Once when I was 16. That's when I started hearing voices and I went to a child psychologist and I was too scared to say I was hearing voices as the voices said if I was to tell anyone they would no longer be just in my head, they would be face to face as the voices took over anyone I was with, my mum and dad and all my friends. So I tried to kinda talk about it and told her about my drinking, wrote everything down in the middle of my diary hoping she would read some of it and find out but she clearly didn't and ended up saying ""but your pretty, I don't see why you have any problems"" and then said to my desperate parents that I was just a spoilt brat and they needed to stop giving me pocket money. That actually made me think it was all real and that everyone did hate me. That lead me down a bad past and kinda resulted in the worst day of my life which was prom and then lots of drinking and ""suicide"" cries for help but then I was made to confess at 18 and was admitted straight to hospital and was diagnosed with first ep psychosis. I did put in an official complaint about her but I don't think anything happened."
schizophrenia,f0p6v82,t3_d60ixa,1568828461.0,"No, this has never happened to me but it must be so disheartening to find out you can't trust your doctor. Are you able to change doctors?  I've been discharged from seeing a community practice nurse when I didn't want to but the NHS here is turning to shit and there are so little staff so I didn't want to take a place of someone who might need more help than me. I just want to say if the medication is working for you even a little bit don't let her take you off them! I was on abilify for about 5 years and I never felt they worked properly and all they really did was turn the volume down. Have you tried other drugs? I was told abilify was the best and for me it wasn't, I'm now on quetiapine and lamotragine they are the most addictive drugs but they have changed my life and I became myself again after being swallowed up by the voices for 7 years. But yeah the voices are the worst for me too, I barely hear them now but the fear that comes over me when I do hear them is terrifying, it almost paralysis me. I've never done any quizzes or anything either, what was the quiz supposed to prove?"
