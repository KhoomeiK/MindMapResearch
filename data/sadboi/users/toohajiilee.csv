In one of those dreams I saw something that was either completely crazy or utterly phenomenal. I know that I’m struggling with his death so I try to take it with a grain of salt and chalk it up as a coping mechanism. Still, these dreams are unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before."

Anxiety,eu8v89z,t3_cf88o1,1563565480.0,"So about a year ago I woke up and I saw a woman standing over my bed. She was looking out my window and then snapped her head down and looked at me. I screamed and she was gone. Right after that happened I immediately knew she was a hallucination for a couple of different reasons. For one, this happened in the middle of the night as I was waking up from a deep sleep; my brain was still in dream mode. And also she looked like a cross between Marie Laveau from AHS: Coven which I was watching at the time and a character from a book that I was reading for who I envisioned having looking just like this woman I saw. 

It really didn’t bother me at all until just a couple of months ago when my anxiety really started to get bad. If I were to see her now I probably wouldn’t want to sleep. I’m like you where I will keep myself up until I see dusk outside my window and then just suffer all day at work because of it. When I do lay down at night and close my eyes I will start to see faces. But I’m too afraid to open my eyes and see her or one of my deceased loved ones standing over my bed or across the room. Often times these thoughts lead to nightmares. In essence, I just don’t want to sleep because of these fears. I would give anything to have the attitude I had a year ago about everything just being a hallucination. 

tl;dr, I totally feel you buddy."
