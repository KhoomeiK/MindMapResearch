  Even if he didn‚Äôt do that he had so many changes and ways to give us an answer and didn‚Äôt. Maybe he planned to reveal who he was with the box. If it has the answer, I don‚Äôt care how he feels the public will receive it SHOW WHAT IS IN THE BOX. Yeesh"

iamsophie,fpb9pi7,t3_gc2c8d,1588465130.0," My weird theory is that the Dad earned his wealth and success by making a deal with HATE. He made the Sophie game to lure girls into this fake life of luxury, spoil them rotten inside out (like the garden in the game) and have them killed by the next girl. Each ‚ÄúSophie‚Äù doesn‚Äôt remember the horrible stuff they did to get their new lives. Once another girl plays the game and takes the deal or the ‚ÄúSophie‚Äù is no longer useful (has no real desires, envy, or hatred left in them.) HATE feeds off hate and envy, so it‚Äôs the Dad‚Äôs job is to collect girls in poor situations that wish for the life people like a ‚ÄúSophie‚Äù has. Idk just my idea on what‚Äôs going on."
