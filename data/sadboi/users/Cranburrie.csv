bipolar,f9p7ank,t3_e5yvau,1575523991.0,"Landed a new job with my own office. After being laid off in April from my job of five years I'm finally feeling confident in my professional abilities again. The job will be challenging; but, it's the highest salary I've ever had. Should have my debt paid in a couple months and I can afford some small Christmas gifts.

Recently dealt with a horrendous breakup with a child involved. Losing both he and his child was devestating. He made me out to be insane to anyone he could after cheating, and was caught slandering me by his coworkers/friends. They cut him off and full on supported me despite my illness and barely knowing me. I'm baking them holiday cookies. They're all big, tough, tattooers (in reality teddy bears).

I received my job offer three days after he told me to, ""suck it, b****.""

Had a few weepy and anxious days here and there the past week but I took my meds and stuck with a routine. Finally working out again regularly, too. Feels good.

Karma's a b**** and bipolar doesn't define you. ""Suck it."" :)"

orchids,eyz2bbq,t1_eyyp7gi,1567607897.0,Thanks! I checked the roots and soaked them for a few minutes before repotting in the orchid pot. The roots seemed to be alright - nothing crispy or rotted. I live in Ohio but my apartment is on the higher end of humidity due to being on the top floor. My windows all face south. I'll pick up some moss from the nursery today to supplement the orchid bark mix I used. :)
abusiveparents,eyxbbdn,t3_cry9k3,1567549103.0,"Bipolar here and pretty certain my mother is as well. Around the time I started really exhibiting consistent notable symptoms (mid-late twenties) I connected with a psych. For years I've worried about becoming my mother, but you're your own person and you need to do what's best for you. When I'm in a negative headspace it reminds me of my mother's anger, but I remember I'm not her and can only be accountable for my own actions. Her unhappiness and refusal for help is not my burden to bare. 

Bipolar can be the absolute pits, but honestly after working through medication and some therapy I've never been happier. I babysit my bf's 4 yr old son multiple times a week with no issues. When he needs disciplined I try to keep a level head and be stern, but also explain to him why he should or shouldn't be doing something. Then reinforce positive behavior. I also encourage him to talk about his feelings. 

And here for the longest time I thought, ""I don't want to be a mom because I won't deserve it. I'll be just like my mother.""

My hypomanic states are extremely mild and it took a long time before I was diagnosed as Bipolar 2. After being on your medication for a couple months it may be easier to get a feel for hypomanic behavior. It was for me at least. Usually I feel more irritable, and sometimes more excitable about the smallest most normal of things. I don't sleep well and mind races. Everyone is different."
