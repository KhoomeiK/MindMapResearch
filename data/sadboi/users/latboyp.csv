schizophrenia,flbgcz1,t3_fnsbqf,1585004070.0,"My thoughts are all over the place on abilify. Like, really disorganized. I need to write down my thoughts just to get them in order. Oftentimes I will consider what I am saying before writing which really doesn't help. 

But considering that I'm more preoccupied with my thoughts that are real and not delusions I feel that this side effect is worth not experiencing psychosis again. 

I've found memory is fine for me.

I find that drinking on abilify leaves me more confused and thoughts more jumbled the day after. I avoid drinking whenever I can."

But yeah. That happened. Depression is gone now and I realize now how much of an asshole I was. Not saying depressed people are assholes it's just that mental illness can definitely complicate your friendships"

NoStupidQuestions,fj3v69x,t3_fbc1f5,1582993946.0,"I smoke because it gives me a sort of ritual to follow. Gives me a chance to get outside and get some ""fresh"" air (I say that with huge striking quotation signs). I smoke for the socialable experiences that you can have from smoking. I now realize how much like shit I smell and how easily it can spread and will probably switch to an e-cig for this very reason. 

But honestly, cigarettes and e-cigs are very different. The head rush, the social stigmas, the health risks, everything."
malementalhealth,fj3uafz,t3_fbao9t,1582993364.0,"I've been addicted to porn for so long (15+ years) and have since recovered. The thing was so rough for me emotionally. If I had a friend with open ears to discuss this with I definitely would have taken the chance.

Two years ago my friends at the time probably wouldn't have been willing to hear the very personal and lonesome experience that is porn addiction. I was afraid of being shamed for this, and being labelled as someone who can't control himself. My biggest fear was losing my friends during college.

Fast forward a couple years I feel lucky to be in a better spot with friends and finally feel like I can talk to my new friends about this. I find I'm becoming attached this new friend group because of this as well but feel a lot better after finally telling them about it. Unfortunately in a couple months we will all be going our separate ways but I'll finally have a time to express myself truthfully with nothing to hide. I'll miss these people a lot.

Anyways I say you take the chance to tell her, but do so a little at a time to not overwhelm her. I'm not really experienced with this as I had literally just gone through this recently, but those are my thoughts. Good luck."

AskReddit,ffguii1,t3_etcyd6,1579915397.0,"Support and community groups are what help most with this kind of thing. When loneliness hits, it becomes difficult to deal with the thoughts of suicide.

Went through a rejection recently after having unhealthily fantasized about our future together which made for a restless sleep last night. I couldn't remember the last time I felt this lonely.

But I'm only 23 and I have 7 years left of this terrible twenties thing and from now the only thing I could possibly think of for coping with this would be to live in the present. I don't have any real connections other than my close sister and it doesn't help that I'm currently a foreigner in the country I'm living in right now. But seeing these comments really help. Thanks for this post. Cheers."
