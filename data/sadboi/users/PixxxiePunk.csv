I may have a sensitivity to sounds. That part I am sorta sure of. I’ve had many experiences with loud sounds (loud bass, window open while driving ect.) and it makes me have double vision, hallucinations -whichh may be symptoms of my panic attacks. Either way they are so unpleasant and terrifying I feel like I’m going to die.

I don’t know if this is helpful but I’m like a 100lbs and I’ve tried small doses of shrooms and I was fine. A higher dose puts me out, I’ll be laying sprawled out on the couch with my pinkie under my tongue because I feel like I’m gonna swallow it- I didn’t have a bad trip- but I did get overwhelmed by sounds once again and had to go sit in the dark for a little bit before I snapped out of it.

I’ve spoken to a therapist for months about EVERYTHING I FELT 24/7. Turns out it was anxiety feeding my dpdr making it appear ten times more miserable than it actually was. 

I’d let my mind get out of control, and get terrified when I felt dpdr. Once I settled in, slowed down and realized I am not in danger “ I am okay “  I’m doing alright at this point.

Don’t push yourself, don’t shame yourself, unless your parents throw your stuff out in the yard there’s no rush to move out. Adult life is terrifying especially if you deal with Anxiety and Dpdr, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. 

Start small, can you manage your money even a little? Can you feed yourself? Can you do basic things for yourself hygiene ect? Those are all good places to start, if you can do these things you’re already more independent than you think. When it comes to bills and paperwork, find a trusted friend or guardian and ask questions if you actually want to start living on your own. 

Yes there are deadlines- but having a planner handy or even a notebook are both good things to lessen the stress. 

Talk to your trusted friends or family! I for one need so much support I question why I even live by myself.. I do not have a close relationship with my family/friends (thanks to depression) so I actually started asking my boss anything I needed to know and she’s supportive and helps me out. 

It’s going to be alright, it’s a massive step so take it at your own pace. I hope all of you are doing well!"

My problem is I can feel my heart a lot it makes me think I have a heart condition. Maybe it’s not the same hyper aware.. I also have a lot of moments where I realize how shitty the world is and I want to die on the spot/have overwhelming panic attacks where I nearly faint/have heart palpitations"

dpdr,fl8u1p1,t1_fl8t5ad,1584932301.0,"Sort of but branching off into brand new labels because it has a new symptom or something, when in fact everyone’s symptoms are going to be different like my adhd- I have newly been diagnosed as ADD because I’ve been shamed since I was a kid for bouncing off the walls, I learned to control my hyperactivity and now I suddenly do not even have it kinda thing"
dpdr,fl8s5yz,t1_fl8q38t,1584930977.0,"I think it’s Aspergers for me personally. Overstimulating leads to dissociating- I’m just overly sensitive to just about everything and all my tics and odd behaviors and with the depersonalization and derealization it all just seems to point to Aspergers symptoms. 

I’m not going to invalidate anyone by saying  ‘this is all fake’ but I do personally feel like a lot of these new mental illnesses are overgeneralizations of things that already exist. There’s nothing wrong with it, it’s just the fact that most of these things are symptoms of something you know but as stated above I don’t mean to offend anyone with my opinion."
