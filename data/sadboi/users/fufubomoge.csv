Thank you for kind words. It took me like six months to finally leave him and I'm glad I did it. Now with all the support I have from my friends, family and therapy I'll be fine soon ❤️"
AgeGap,fotxrr5,t1_fotfuox,1588069907.0,"Thank you! After breaking up with him I started feeling better. I also have been talking about this relationship with my mom and close friends so I have a lot of support from them. I also have professional help from my therapist so I think I'll be okay soon.
When I told some of my friends about it they were also angry and back then I couldn't understand why but now I know.
I definitely learned my lesson, I hope I'll not make the same mistakes in the future"
