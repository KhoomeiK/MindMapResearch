I wish you the best for this day, and remember that it's a big accomplishment to have made it this far when you haven't imagined that you could make it this far. Keep fighting, you proved yourself that you are strong enough to keep trying, and now take a look: You reached 19 years old after thinking that you wouldn't make it. That's the best proof that you still have hope in you, and maybe life has better things planned for you.

Well done, baby. Keep it up :D ."
depression,fiwfc1t,t3_fa2gpq,1582783831.0,"I really thank you for your kind words, OP. The story of our fights never ends, but at the end of the day what counts is that people like us try their best to get through another day.

Oh, if only other people could see it and just empathize a bit... Your words motivate me to keep trying. Thanks again..."
depression,fiu4ibi,t3_f9rtou,1582735007.0,"I understand you, and I know that those thoughts may sink you when you think a lot about it. It's a hard struggle, but remember that you have power and control over your mind. Suicidal thoughts will make you feel worthless, tired, a burden, or even make you feel ashamed of yourself, so this negativity ends up taking control of you slowly... You can avoid this by trying to focus on other things like watching some videos on YouTube, playing videogames, watching a TV show, looking for new music, reading or other activities that may interest you. Just try it, although you may have no interest, no gains to do anything, but try it if you want to keep your mind busy with other stuff. You should do a little attempt. 
First, you recognize that those suicidal thoughts have been disrupting your mind lately. You have recognized the problem, which is the first step. Now, trying to change the focus of your thoughts it's the next step. Remember that the thoughts you cultivate and nurture are those that will keep becoming stronger, which are those that you choose to believe in. Maybe you can try to meditate also, to relax and have a better control. 

Please, don't let those dangerous passive thoughts become stronger. You can control them, you have power over them. Remember that it's depression what makes you think about suicide, not you, since you don't want to die. You have control over it, remember it."

You have no idea how lucky you are for being treated so nicely by her, specially for being a stranger (although somehow you got to known each other because of that honest concern from her). Someday it would be very nice if you could thank her face to face. It may mean a lot to her knowing that her little gesture means a lot for someone like you. 

Oh, but you are very lucky. Believe me."

depression,fh5bi85,t3_f1e1fr,1581287163.0,"If you want to be good enough, try to achieve that by trying to be the best for yourself. A career, a degree, a job become secondary things to aspire to be good at if you don't look into yourself first. What's more, you can begin working on that goal today, or whenever you feel willing to, but you have the power to bring the change at every moment.
You only have to focus on being the best for yourself, never to please other people, because you are going to be your own lifelong company, you will be the one who will adress your life and how you want it to be (don't let others interfere with your goals) and you will be the one who knows better than anyone else the potential and will you have to achieve your goals, although you may not see it now... Believe in yourself, that's the first step after keeping hope for things to get better. You will be a very good person once you see that you can be that and want to be that. You can do it, you can start today the change that someday you'll be grateful for when you look back at your past, and so you will realise how far you could do it after believing in you. 

Live it all, and give it all for yourself."
depression,fh516nt,t1_fh1ymbr,1581284002.0,"It's beauteous to contemplate such metamorphosis... 

And yes, I won't deny that I still have hope for things to get truly better, which is my main reason to keep trying and pushing forward. Working on it, certainly.

You should be proud of yourself indeed, and when you look back, realise how much you have achieved and how much you passed through to be where you are now... 

Thanks for your support words :) ."

depression,fh371mm,t3_f1320v,1581265601.0,"Please, stay, don't go. This is a tough struggle, it may seem like it's eternal, but look at how much you have resisted over all those years. You haven't done it before, instead you stayed, fought and resisted, and all because you were willing to stay alive, you had the courage to keep trying although every day seemed like a new struggle, again and again, but you never resigned yourself. Darkness has blinded you so much that you don't actually see how strong you really are after keeping yourself up all this time, after managing somehow to handle all this pain. Against all odds you never ceased to battle, you kept going where others would have already given up, it takes so much strenght and courage to face it like you did... You still can do it, you could resist all this time and you can still do it. Don't let darkness overcome your spirit! You are strong, and try to keep strong.

We don't know each other, I know, but I understand your struggle, and really, I'm very glad to read that you are still here. And yes, you definitely should feel proud of yourself, because you could fight that inner demon that was tempting you to throw you to that void which has no way back, because you are still willing to live another day, even though is hard, and because you still want to fight with that continuous struggle that invades your mind. How can I claim such thing? You demonstrated that you still want to live, that deep within there's still a little hope for things to get better, and all of this because you defeated that turtuous temptation to be embraced by death... With that, you proved to yourself that you are capable of getting away, at least for a moment, all those demons, and that a strenght that makes you embrace life lies deep within yourself, although you may not be aware of it... Just think of all those struggles you can win by embracing that strength that keeps you alive, that makes you, again, embrace life, makes you attached to it although everyday feels like dying in two legs, but just having power over it... You will note a difference, at least. You can do it, you can still be willing to fight...

Last, please think about this question that someone in this page has done, and since I saw it, it helps me to get away deathly thoughts: If you had killed yourself one year ago, how many moments wouldn't you have had the chance to live?

You definitely should be proud of yourself, buddy. You are still here..."
depression,fgpjzgt,t1_fgob2y4,1581006328.0,"Oh, I really feel that... I can imagine the feeling of being locked down, being at your own home with a feeling of being confined to what it can feel as being in jail, longing for freedom although you are a 'free' human being... All those years you could have lived totally different, taken away by those who were supposed to give you the best they could... Now it only takes daydreaming to imagine all the ways we wanted our life to be, and at the end, imagination is our best company at the end of the day...

It's overwhelming the fact that we can't change the past, but now the best you can do is try to change your future, try to make it YOURS, try to go and work for the life you are longing to have. I know that this won't compensate the years that are gone, but at least it is the only thing that you can do best to make the rest of your life worth living, and to get away new 'What if..?' questions that you probably have asked yourself so, so many times..."

depression,fgns12p,t1_fgnk0eg,1580951636.0,"I see. Actually the horrible thing here is what he has done to you, and I think that you may be right: He said that for himself... Maybe he stated such words as they were just casual stuff, something that he came up with in the moment, but we don't know... The only thing that is assured is that it was a pretty lie, and sadly your friend wasn't offering you a reliable friendship, thus not being a real friend at the end. After what you told in your comment, I understand more about the situation, and again, this ended up showing you the true facet of this person. Although you still love him and care for him, please keep in mind that if you attach yourself to this person after all, you will end up embracing the idea you have of that person, you will embrace his memory, an idealized picture of him before all of this happened, and believe me that this melancholy will only add more fuel to all the things you already carry within. Someone who really loves you wouldn't do such horrible thing, and this speaks a lot about that person. Actions demonstrate how true words are... This way, life is showing you the quality of the people that surrounds you. I know that it's not easy, and and that this hurts like hell, but at the end it is making you a favour, because it makes you realise how true to yourself are the people you call friends, how true their words are, how their actions define them in your eyes, and how toxic they can be to you (definetly people to stay away from, and sadly your friend was like this). Better people will come to you. It can seem like it won't, like you will be alone for an endless time, but people who really care for you will appear, and there can even be people out there who care for you, but while being in this abyss, you don't see it... 

You couldn't see this situation coming, and again I have to tell you: This is not your fault. Nothing is your fault. If he had such an attitude towards you, let him be. Someday he will look back at what he has done to you and he will wallow in shame and regret, because he left someone who would have done anything for him, because he meant a lot to this someone, because someone considered him very special and he just let him go... Shame it's the price that, at the end of the day, he will face after breaking a distressed person who used to see a light in him... 

So, my friend, now the best thing you can do for yourself is try to think more in yourself, try to focus more on hope for a better future without him near to storm you..."

depression,fgnfvvj,t3_ezbr32,1580944003.0,"Delete them. Social media has a negative impact in lots of people many, many examples, like the one you described. But remember, not everything that shines is gold, and believe me that people in social media always try to make their lives seem as they are perfect, but actually they are not. It's just a pantomime, something that helps them to sell the ideal of a perfect life and helps them to have a positive image between their fellows, and thus they condemn themselves to reduce their value according to the ""likes"" they receive. At the end, they end up measuring their value based on a simple number... Who could live happily with this? Nobody, that's right.

 Deleting your social media will make you feel better, and you won't be wasting your time, although it may make you feel isolated. Even though, keep in touch with life out there. Real life contact is better than virtual contact in this case, so don't lose yourself from keeping you isolated of everything out there."

Keep in mind the best, and remember that anxiety is only trying to play with you. Don't let it overcome you with more fear. Instead, think that this is a big step you have made, and think about all the things that you want to tell her when you have that talk. She may be ready to listen to you :) ."
depression,fgncr7x,t3_ezbcno,1580942117.0,"What you explain are the kind of people that are not trustworthy, people who only want you around to have a good time, to satisfy their inner necessity to feel good with themselves, thus using good times and shallowness. Definetly people who are just a burden to have around you, because sadly they don't care about you, they don't see you as a human being who has its own story and deepness lying within you, and they don't care about inquiring into you, about knowing you better. They just see others as a mean to have some fun, or in worst cases they have other types of bad intentions towards others. The best thing you can do for yourself is to stay away from those toxic people. As you said, they could claim that they care for civil rights, the environment, LGBT+ community, etc, but that will never compensate the hypocrisy they carry around by not caring for their fellow ones who are in need, and even though they, in their blind hypocrisy, go around claiming themselves to be ""good people, different from the rest"", they don't mean it, it's all shallow and untrustworthy verbosity. It's a shame that they must carry, and it's their conscious fault, not yours. It's not your fault that they are not people who you can rely on, it's not your fault that they aren't truly empathetic, and neither it's your fault that they just go away... Believe me, it's better to walk alone than to be surrounded by vultures, so the best you can do for yourself, again, is to keep those type of people away. Not doing that will only keep bringing you down and will poison your mind with deceitful faults you are not responsible for.

In regards to your friend, he/she shouldn't have gone away, specially not after telling you that he/she loved you no matter what. A broken promise... but at the end it showed you his/her true facet. Even though, you don't know if his/her reasons were true, maybe something's wrong in his life, or maybe he meant his words. We truly don't know, but he/she should't have left you in the first place if he/she really loved you.
But if you feel the big necessity, try one last time to have the friendship back. Only then you will know if everything came to an end or if there's still a chance. It's the only way to bring you some peace."

depression,ff8914h,t3_es440i,1579669552.0,"They don't understand, noticeably they have never tried to be in your shoes, and they say things like that like they have always had a perfect life... Frustrating, I know. Definitely not people who you can rely on. You should try to look for other people you trust to explain how you feel, someone who may have enough understanding to comprehend you. Staying surrounded by that ineffective positive things that these people say, although they may be doing a little attempt to help you, will only keep bringing you down.

And with what you claim, you are right, it's not easy to control that fervent hell that lives within you. There'll be times, if not constantly, when it will consume you till tearing you apart, but if you could reach to this point, today, by telling us your story after having been suffering for a while, it's because you keep fighthing, you haven't given up yet, and deep within you are still willing to fight against that heavy hell that burdens your soul every day, even tought every day feels like a tortuous doom where you die away again. To be standing, to have a little motivation to live another day is the greatest and most valuable strength that you carry within. That is what's keeping you alive, it's your lighthouse that keeps pushing you forward through this stormy sea, against all odds. You may be your worst enemy, you may condemn your mind and yourself feeding destructive thoughts, you may be pouring oil upon the flames this way, but at the same time you have the power to be your own salvation... The demons that live within you are starving for completly devour your soul, but you have power over them, you are more powerful than them because you have absolute control over them, althought it may not seem so. It's you and only you who can still be feeding them by reassuring all the destructive ideas that crash in your mind and end up knocking you off, only you can give those ideas the power to bring you down when you believe in them, it's only you... who can make your mind strong enough to not believe to those dangerous things that those demons want you to believe, just to maintain you as a slave of them. Do it once, ignore those ideas and think ""I'm better than all this crap"", and you may feel more different than ever. A little step like that can bring you enough more strenght to make a significant change. Never underestimate the power of your mind, since it depends on you how you want your life, and yourself to be.

Death may seem like the only way out. It tempts you. No more overwhelming feelings, no more suffering, no more heaviness in your soul, nothing. A way to end all this hell... But it's not the solution, believe me. Nothing guarantees you that it will bring you peace, instead it will bring pain between those who really care for you, althought it may seem like it's you, alone in this battle against yourself. It's not an option, since once it's done, there's no way back. No more chances, no more hopes, no more ways to improve... Nothing. It's an eternal void. Death will never replace all the things you still can do to change your life, to look for a better future, and who knows if you even can change somebody's life for good, or even more people's lives. To risk it all... is it worthy?

You just have to think: Do you still want to fight, keep following that strenght, that light of the salvation that lighthouse is, and still fighting for a future, with hope being your ultimate savior, or will you still allow your demons to keep wrecking you till they devour what you still have of your soul fading it away to ashes, destroying all of yourself?..."

He/she definitely failed as a friend, and this lamentably proved to you that wasn't someone worthy, although he/she had an enormous value for you. It's very important for you to take into account and remember that this wasn't your fault, you haven't done anything wrong for feeling the way you feel. Your feelings always are your deepest truth. Althought your situation is painful, in a way it made you a favor after making you realise how that person truly was, and how unreliable the friendship this person offered was. Try not to allow the situation make you feel bad with yourself, please. Instead, feel whatever you want towards that person who hurt you: anger, deception, betrayal, etc, but never feel guilty for what happened. It's better to be alone than be surrounded by vultures. That other person should be ashamed of itself. 

With that being said, keep the hope, although it seems to be fading away. Keep looking forward to find someone who will truly appreciate you for who you are and will have a genuine desire to be there for you. Maybe it will come to you in a unexpected moment... 
If that's not enough, try to make a change in your surroundings. Although it may seem too tiring, do an attempt. Try to find a little strength deep within yourself and go for a walk, go to a park or wherever. It may help you to clear up your mind, and maybe you'll have the chance to know someone, and maybe you can let it in your life.
It even helps to take your inner burden away by talking about it with a stranger. Believe me that it can help."
