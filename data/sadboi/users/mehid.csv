There is loot u want to click, chaos, exalt etc. Loot u need, that u don’t really want to click cuz the drop rate is higher like alts and jewelers. But u can get those through itens as well so its fine. Then there is all the ones I cited the loot pet should pick, they drop in loads and most ppl just have them filtered away.

As engi you don’t even want to move that much, at the start u are a support for ur turrets, killing the melee mobs and not letting the turret get swarmed. When you get more itens all you do is place turrets, go kinda afk with ur bubble while u farm money and then go around the map opening boxes.

Artificer on the other hand, she has to do all the killing herself. “Oh but she has a mobility alt skill”, dude all it does is move her up, it doesn’t even have a great range for the damage which means you usually just use it for getting a better angle on enemies or escaping projectiles coming towards you on a high cool down. It’s really bad when compared to the fire beam, the most dps ability in the game. You gotta aim precisely at the enemy, while keeping ur distance and running from them, and if you don’t kill them quick you tend to die.

Sorry for rant, just mad ppl can’t see engi as for what they are: A class that doesn’t even want to move, just wanna stack mushrooms activate teleporter and watch movies on the background.

PathOfExileBuilds,fizozd6,t3_fanh03,1582869275.0,"Poison bv needs some lvls and 4 ascendancy points to get going smoothly, while ED contagion with blight as single target works as early as lvl 12.

What I am saying is u will play ED contagion until u lvl up to about lvl 60 or so. Stacking first chaos dmg multiplier in ur tree, and if u decide that u wanna try bv poison, you ascend into assassin and get the poison ascendancies, and then tweak ur tree accordingly.

I played both builds and honestly I didn’t like how BV poison felt, I think its just personal preference. Both builds use a lot of buttons, whitering totem, vaal blight,  bv whitering step plague bearer OR ed contagion blight. But the ED build just casts contagion+ed and the whole screen is dead, while the BV one you have to run towards ur enemies for them to die while also keeping ur blades at 5+ charges.

So to conclude, which should you choose? If you wanna push hard and fast at the start of league without investing much into ur character, ED contagion trickster is ur best bet, its faster clear and barely needs any good weapons to have respectable dps. Poison BV assassin on the other hand, has better damage scaling for late game, slower clear but still good one, its a vaal skill meaning it has better burst dmg too, requires decent gear and levels to melt stuff and feel good. These builds probably will be unaffected by the next league start so I would just try them out right now, make a ssf character from scratch and see if u like and which u like best.

Edit: also since u are aiming for those deep delves, trickster is usually easier to go for a CI build which can be really tanky and more survivable against delve content."
