I had T'rissa give the party a quest to slaughter the sea hags and they did readily as the hags threatened to consume the goblin infant the party has adopted. They then went back to T'rissa, who gave them another quest to recover Azroks blade for herself (stole the quest from the hobgoblins) I also has the party meet up with two shopkeepers who were drow sisters. One was cheerful while the other was rather dismissive and rude. Im trying to use T'rissa as a questgiver and introduction to the drow."
