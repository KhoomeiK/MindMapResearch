I find it normal for a husband to help the wife with house chores and viceversa, just as a 
team. 

In my country which is a non muslim country, what you just said about men happens in most of the families here, men act like rules over women which I find absolutely disgusting.

You said something about cooking, women here say the same, to be honest I would find it funny and beautiful watching my wife trying to cook for us, even if she knows or not, I would try to help her do the cooking, thats what a marriage is, in my opinion.

May Allah reward you with which is good

religion,ewz334u,t1_ewxfkne,1565890489.0,"Hello, as i know, Quran teaches muslims to respect other religions and its people. 
What is happening is this: 
1.Uneducated muslims/or some other people of faith didnt even read their Holy Book and they say that it is the truth( i experienced this on my own). In order to defend you faith, learn it, study it. When you talk about someones faith, study it, read about it from different points of view. One of the best things in our time is that we can look for information very easy.
2.People belive what happens on the TV is real 
If you draw something, and you do it in order to annoy someone (like someone makes a draw of my mom in a bad way, of course ill be mad, its your right to defend her or values in that case), expect a response. 
3.Radical people, the most dangerous, stubborn people. 
“ the mental flexibility of the wise man permits him to keep an open mind and enables him to readjust himself whenever it becomes necesary for a change “ - Malcom X 
4. Terrorism. All those people who did acts of terrorism, whatever faith they have, if we put them in 2 groups of faith, they all have 1 thing in common! Terrorism actions! And yes, there are bad muslims, christians, jews ! But the acts of those bad people must not change my view or your view about all the people from that faith. 
5.Think to those days when (im still studying this)black people from America had to suffer racist critics because they are black(you dont choose your skin color), now is kinda the same and of course you get mad when people tell you false stuff about your religion ( and they dont even ask, they actually teach you ). “ ah your people of faith did this did that killed that etc etc “, my brother calm down, if we look back in history, ALL religions have cruel incidents where people were slaughtered, innocent people. You just can t say “ you christians/jews/muslims did that! Tralala “, well as i just said, look into your faith history, you will see that your people did the same.

Peace be upon you. (Sry for english mistakes)"
religion,ewya3vt,t3_cqpjg2,1565877500.0,"In my opinion, you just cant explain the trinity properly, after i did some research for myself, i realized that the concept of trinity came into existence a long time before christianity, so you cant say that the trinity has origins in christianity,(as i know in greek mythology, Zeus had sex with a virgin and Hercules was born, which is kinda similar to christianity, but keep i mind that greeks mythology is older than christianity)this concept has origins in pagan concepts (i dont know if i should call it pagan but also you can find trinity in egypt also) or you can see it in hinduism. 
“ Hinduism believes in a trinity of gods: Brahma (the creator), Vishnu (the preserver), and Shiva (the destroyer).” 

But still there are lots of questions: 
Why do we actually need the trinity?
Why do we need the blood sacrifice(pagan concept) ? 
God said “ Be “ and it was, why would God kill himself in his Own world with His own rules, killed by His creation, having absolute power over absolute every atom in this univers?
