Trump said... nahhh, fuck you. No asylum seekers can cross until we adjudicate. So, here's your nice pen for....weeks, months, we dunno. What Obama did was temporary detention.. it was only in specific cases, for only specific reasons, for as limited amount of time as possible.

I'm hoping that the fools who protest voted in 2016 have wised up. Protest voting is counter productive. It does not serve progressive goals. You're arguing for your right to cut off your nose to spite your face.

But I'm not going to fall on the sword during election season. Elections have consequences... it's not about how I feel. It's about the choice that is best for the country. Do your patriotic duty. Vote for the lesser evil in November. Then, work to push for more progressive policies as you've always done. There's no silver bullet here. You want to a more progressive America?

The prequels were cartoonish, and poorly made, and not my cup of tea. But they didn't destroy the originals. They added to them. They reoriented the series towards Anakin and his sacrifice, and that added a whole new level to the story that we didn't know before. That's the whole point of these sorts of additions - to build off of and grow the original work.

The sequels, on the other hand, were well made atrocities. They actually hurt the originals, by making Luke a failure and making Anakin's success worthless. Where the prequels created this whole new perspective to look at the originals, the sequel trilogy argues that the episodes before were nothing but a windy path.... and it is only now... at the very end... that we really see how things are resolved. It's not this mythic journey, but instead... a sort of luck occurrence, where the circumstances were right. Anakin's and Luke's and ObiWans work is really pretty pointless after the sequels.

The Skywalker family line is now irrelevant thanks to the sequel trilogy. Watching all the movies is relatively unimportant. Anakin wasn't destined to bring balance... he was a useless pawn of the Emperor. He didn't really destroy the evil in the galaxy. In fact, his son allowed it to continue and get even worse than before. 

The whole thing is a big convoluted mess now, thanks to the sequels.... with the galaxy literally being no better off than it was before. Is Palpatine really dead this time? Who's to say?

He's not a Republican of the far right persuasion. You know who is? Donald Trump. Again... you can disagree with a guy a lot without making him just as bad as the opponent. It's called being an adult. Grow up.

It's people like you who are going to get Trump re-elected, because apparently... elections mean, ""my way or nothing"" now. Cool...."
politics,fi0f2ex,t1_fi0dabo,1582035412.0,"Cool.....

There's little to no evidence that Bloomberg would seek to hurt NATO or the UN. That he'd continue with this foreign policy of hurting our friends while helping our enemies. No indication that he has a hard on for dictators. No indication that he thinks climate change is a hoax. 

And again, will Bloomberg nominate a Red Hat conservative to replace RBG? No... most likely he wouldn't. By that fact alone, he's far better than Trump. 


It's people like you who are going to sabotage us again, because it's your guy or the highway.... huh? Grow up. Defeating Trump is the top goal at this moment in time, for good reason."
politics,fi0cv79,t1_fi0c1i5,1582033760.0,Like I've said already. Will Bloomberg jeopardize a woman's right to choose? Will he nominate a conservative looney tune to replace RBG? Will he destabilize our post WW2 alliances? Will he build a useless wall along our Southern border? Will he empower the evangelical crazies? He's better than Trump in nearly every way. Come on. Get serious. He doesn't have to be your favorite candidate in the world in order to admit that he's far less dangerous than Trump.
politics,fi0973h,t1_fi05jtl,1582030770.0,"It was already that way due to Citizens v. United. 

And if you are asking me to protest vote... then the answer is no. In the adult world, we choose between two whittled down choices. IF Bloomberg ends up going head to head against Trump, I'd vote for him easily over Trump. Easily. 

The real threat to our country is Donald Trump. He can not have the opportunity to replace RBG's seat. Period. That's what's important. Christ."
politics,fi090tt,t1_fi05rlw,1582030618.0,"I've admitted that he isn't great. That he has his pitfalls. But he is a far far far better alternative to a Trump 2nd term. Would Bloomberg pretend that climate change doesn't exist? Would Bloomberg jeopardize a woman's right to choose? Would Bloomberg deconstruct the post WW2 alliances? Would Bloomberg nominate a flaming conservative to replace RBG? 


No he wouldn't. I can dislike Bloomberg, but still admit that he isn't nearly as dangerous as Trump. Give me a break. Please don't do this litmus testing, purity testing bullshit again."
politics,fi08s15,t1_fi06m5b,1582030403.0,"He's far far far far better than Trump. Would Bloomberg pick a flaming conservative to replace RGB? No, he wouldn't. So shut the fuck up with your purity testing, hyperbolic nonsense. I can think that there are better candidates without making Bloomberg the equivalent of Red Hat Donald Trump. What nonsense."
politics,fi057xg,t1_fi033l8,1582026846.0,"No he’s not. He’s much much much better than trump. I’d vote for my dog, if it was between the dog and trump. 

Let’s not say anything that could fuck us over later. Bloomberg isn’t great. He’s not my choice. But trump is one of a kind awful, and the primary mission is to get him out of office."

However.... when it comes to dudes, we tend to be in or out, and we tend to speak more through our actions than our words. His actions are telling you that maybe he likes you, but he's only willing to put in a minimum amount of effort into it. That's what he's telling you. 

Cause if he really liked you, most guys would chew through cardboard to let you know. When we are into it, we call... we initiate... 

Again, that's not necessarily this guy, but generally.. this is how men operate. 

I agree with others, that you basically have to just ask him openly and honestly."

He doesn't regularly ramble and change subjects. You're exaggerating. 

People would obviously get demotivated to vote for Biden with people like you running around, spreading and enhancing Republican talking points. 

Biden being dragged down and having an old man cage fight is what the electorate want. Liberals have been saying that we don't need to resort to Trump's tactics to beat him... well... maybe we do. It seems like the voters want Biden in part, because they think he can swing against Trump in that kind of personal way that is needed. 

Biden would be a fine president as compared to every president before this. He's basically tailor suited to be President. If it were between him and Dole, I'd pick Biden. Between Biden and Reagan... I'd pick Biden. You're angry that Biden doesn't agree with you enough. You want someone who is more progressive, like you. I can understand that... but you don't have to make stuff up about him being this aloof, senile man talking to the clouds have the time. Disagree with him. Vote for someone else because your disagreements. But don't lobby unfair attacks at aa guy, when you know they are the attacks that Republicans are going to pick up and run with if Biden is the nominee. And right now... it's looking like Biden will probably be the nominee. It could be Bernie. That's why I'm not gonna attack him personally either."

Before election season, he was one of the most liked men in the country. He’s got a personal story that resonates and a lifetime of public service. 

He’s not much better than Hillary policy wise, I’ll give you that... but politically, he checks off the boxes in a way that Hillary didn’t."
