schizophrenia,f1dc288,t3_d8we8f,1569379476.0,I'm going through the same thing. Just waiting to see if I dropped the atom bomb that is my genetics on my son. He mentions seeing things and hearing things. It makes him feel better that I say it happens to me too. I dont know if its him being a kid or if its serious.
AMA,f0makta,t3_d5i7xk,1568740601.0,Why?
schizophrenia,f05vbr4,t3_d3uu25,1568420775.0,Oh wow! That's so amazing. I never comment on posts but I really just want you to tell you congratulations and I am so proud of you!
skyrim,eymi14g,t3_cxic3m,1567209670.0,That's awesome! Gimme
schizoaffective,eyihhaz,t1_eyi50ht,1567102523.0,"Kids are amazing little people. So resilient and smart. I'm so glad shes doing well. It's a hard thing to deal with on both of your sides but I'm sure she is and will become a very intelligent, capable young woman. With you by her side, she'll always have support and that's the most important thing."
schizoaffective,eyi1zqm,t3_cwvkkd,1567096349.0,"I'll take a look. Thank you! 

If you need anything you can always message me as well. I may be going through the same thing in a few years. Hopefully not but I know its heartbreaking for your baby to talk about how he/she hates life etc and hearing voices. Mine is talking about that now. You try to shield them but you cant from their own thoughts."
schizoaffective,eyhxtr6,t1_eyhv44p,1567094371.0,"I'll have to look that up. From the research I was able to understand, the white matter in our brains start to disappear and that could be part of it. I'm not a doctor or anything so I didnt understand all of it. That was the jist that I got from it. It was very interesting but terrifying at the same time."
schizoaffective,eyhury1,t1_eyhstv5,1567093035.0,"You are absolutely right. That kind of advice can really make her feel worse. Oh God is testing me? Are you serious? No, my brain processes different than everyone else."
schizoaffective,eyhrse4,t1_eyhdrfy,1567091761.0,"I'm 31 with an 8 year old son. So I have the mom perspective too and it's so hard. That's amazing that you are able to connect with other people and hear their experiences. That will help your daughter so much. My mom had no idea what to do so she just locked me in my room during my episodes. Nobody seemed to know what to do. I was the youngest the doctors had with those problems. I had one therapist tell me they dont diagnose people under 18 with bi polar. I got really mad because obviously that's not true and what kind of therapist thinks that? I didnt go back to her. My biggest advice as far as therapy goes is to vet them before your daughter talks to them. You dont want them telling her something that wont actually help. Some therapists are crazy and just tell you to pray or something. I dont know your beliefs but praying doesnt take the voices away. But you seem like a great mom and shes lucky to have you. Just be patient with her as shes going through things. Music was my outlet and without it, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be here now. So try to keep her focused on her art right now and encourage her to enter contests or get out there."
schizoaffective,eyh6x51,t3_cwvkkd,1567082809.0,"I'll follow her on Instagram! 

Please tell her that her work is amazing and she has crazy potential and will get even better if she works at it. 

As far as the schizoaffective, I was originally diagnosed bi polar because schizoaffective wasnt made or used enough at age 14 when I had my first big episode. School is so hard and I wanted to drop out but my mom made me finish. I've been on meds for 15 years now to stabilize and every few years I've had to switch because they stopped working as well. My teenage years were the hardest time of my life. Every emotion is so big and overpowering. 

If she needs someone to talk to about it, contact me and I would be happy to help. 

I wish you guys the best. Tell her to just keep going even when it's hard and we all know all hard it will be. Shell make it and have an amazing future with a mother like you pushing and supporting her. 

Sorry this is so long. I have a soft spot for young people with these issues."

Schizophrenic,ev5kubm,t3_cigaap,1564235293.0,When someone drives by my house slowly. Are they scoping my house out to rob me or kill me? Or are they the government watching me? I better stand at the window and watch until they go away.
BipolarReddit,euq93k9,t3_ch67d2,1563973529.0,Its definitely not great most of the time. I have no desire to be creative. Im not that creative. My bank account hates me and I hate it.

schizophrenia,eq59eyo,t1_eq326pv,1559795609.0,I can deal during the day. It's at night when I'm trying to sleep and my dresser starts singing to me. Are you serious? Now I have to listen to the music choice of what? A disease. Lol how does that work?
schizophrenia,eq31og7,t1_eq2xtpi,1559748030.0,Yeah same here! I read an article that some people thought it was soothing. I'm not so sure about that.
