You would also need to set up a TB for the other Corp B and correspondingly record, Dr. Expense, Cr. Due to/from related party Corp B. This is assuming, of course, that the two companies are related. If not, it would be the same idea but replace the words related with the company’s name. Is that what you meant? The transaction flowed through both entities?"
Anxiety,fnx41yp,t1_fnwkgrd,1587331067.0,"One helpful thing my therapist told me, is to remember that everyone is in a panic mode and none of us are broken for feeling this way (in or outside of a pandemic). Whatever struggles we arr usually facing, now it’s amplified in this time of unusual crisis, but we’re real all in this together. Virtually reach out to friends and family, make some time for hobbies, exercise, warm baths, self love in general. 5/10 minute breathing and meditation exercises on YouTube work great too! I’m not saying any of this will completely take your anxiety away, but focusing on understanding what’s going on in your head and giving yourself some immediate relief against panicky feelings is the first step that my therapist told me. I used to not be able to breathe properly but even doing yoga and 4-7-8 breathing exercises helped me a ton!"

For instance someone High up called me into their office and I nearly had a panic attack on the way over thinking I was going to get some serious talking to even though I haven’t done anything wrong and it was about fixing something on an expense report I made, not a big deal AT ALL. As anxious people it’s so easy to overreact and have the sirens go off 24/7 but through working on thoughts and actions we can overcome that. Thanks!

In my industry we bill clients so if I spent too much time pretending to work I can’t bill it and then my utilization goes down too low which kinda sucks but oh well motivates me to try and be efficient. What I’ve started doing on weekends is spend 1 night with friends,  a day / night with my boyfriend, visit my parents for a short bit and then try to do errands split between Saturday and Sunday so Sunday doesn’t feel quite as busy this all occupies most of the weekend, so I have time to have fun but won’t spend the whole weekend overthinking anxiously which tends to happen if I sit there doing nothing too long. If I have any other small tasks I can unload off my plate like sending some emails or quick work tasks sometimes I do that on Sunday too to keep my mind busy and make the week ahead feel less overwhelming. It’s too bad that even doing all of this with nothing to actually worry about I still feel a sense of dread lol."

I actually moved out recently so I don’t have to worry about hiding it from my parents as much anymore. But I still feel somewhat guilty about it and feel bad that I have to hide such an important person who I may one day marry From my family. However my dad’s putting on the pressure to get married and my mom is more lax about it but I can’t tell her anything without her telling my dad. And then there’s the obvious “no sex before marriage” thing which is the main reason they don’t want me dating... also I have a protective older brother who also wants me married and if I told my parents they’d tell him and he’d also push me towards marriage. 

It sucks because our relationship is in a good spot but neither of us is ready for marriage yet, in terms of the place our careers are at and our mental state/readiness. I wish desi parents would open up more about moving to a different country and realize we don’t live back home anymore, but I guess that’s hard for them to do. It’s not even like my bf is a different race although he is from a different sect of Islam than my family. He fits pretty much all of the check boxes that my parents would have for a guy - Muslim, good job, good family, doesn’t drink or smoke, good looking and kind and treats me well.

Good luck! Hope it works out well for you. Like even with today I brought it up so minimally and got a barrage of lectures and texts, so that kind of thing on top of my family constant fighting with each other and with me has made me extremely depressed. All I can do now is push myself to move forward and pave my own path, and you sound like you're doing the same which is great."
ABCDesis,exfimse,t1_exfe1te,1566241377.0,"I've tried to come at it from that angle, but the issue is that my mom loves doing stuff for us because she does not have much else going on in her life. Since I'm the last kid at home, she feels she will have absolutely nothing to do when I am gone, which is sort of sad, but also I can't just stay at home forever just because of that..."

I took a job at a smaller company and I’ve been so much happier since. Is there potential for you to move back home sooner?"
exmuslim,eviujpx,t1_ev8ueto,1564549697.0,"Update - talked to my dad and he was surprisingly chill about it! He works in the real world but I still thought he was gonna convince me not to leave. My brother and sister in law are on my side too, they will all help to talk to my mom to ease her worries. I can’t believe this is happening!"

However the abroad school has costs my parents hundreds of thousands in paying off loans and I won’t ask for a single penny once I’m gone so you would think, logically, that they would be happy about it..."

So my excuse is moving downtown will save me an hour of commute each way (2 hours per day). 

True, the problem is my mom won’t even have a discussion. She says “don’t say ridiculous things. You haven’t seen the outside world.” Like wtf yes I have? I work in the outside world unlike you who just sits at home all day..."

Calgary,eucs5ts,t1_eu7josj,1563684816.0,"Omg why are they always fixing those escalators? I take the train almost every weekday and I’ll never for the life of me understand why they pay someone to try and keep fixing it, versus stop trying and just leave them as stairs / replace them altogether. There’s already a handicap elevator so I will never understand why the city is wasting so much money trying to fix something that’s been broken for years..."
relationships,eu54k9b,t1_eu4cxho,1563469760.0,"Thanks so much for the response. For sure - I was feeling down about it and making assumptions which is really wrong of me. It’s something I tend to do in everyday life due to having pretty bad anxiety that I need to work on. I think phrasing it by asking how he’s feeling about us is a good idea, also probably better to bring up in person than over text so it doesn’t seem Iike I’m angry and we can more easily talk it out. 

Exactly - I want to make him feel like he can talk about things. I regret ever snapping at him cuz I don’t want him to feel like there is lack of trust but I’ve apologized multiple times so I guess all I can do going forward is be a better version of myself. I’ll try not to worry so much without talking to him first!"
