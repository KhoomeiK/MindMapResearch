Like intense obsessions with celebrities, sometimes people around me, and I can’t stop thinking about them and I feel like I know them personally and closely when I really don’t. I relate to this a lot"

schizophrenia,fdil67u,t3_elkk75,1578445355.0,"In my last real relationship my partner would get angry or upset with me when I showed any of my symptoms. After leaving that horrible relationship I tried meeting new people but my symptoms were always too much for them and they would become uncomfortable. I’m feeling much better about life after deciding that I just won’t won’t get involved, romantically, with other people. And I’m really fine with being alone"
schizophrenia,f7achzn,t1_f7a8zg2,1573525899.0,"Another useful alternative for me was trying to peel a frozen orange. The cold temperature and like “mission” to peel the orange helps for some reason. It does for me anyways. My therapist suggested it and even provided the frozen orange for me. I was having an awful week and was on edge of being hospitalized, being checked up on frequently but I somehow made it through. I actually use the orange thing a lot now. plus the orange peel smells good."
