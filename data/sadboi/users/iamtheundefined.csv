The history of sex based separation of public restrooms is actually kind of depressing. This law only came to life in the 19th century from the idea that, in order to protect the virtue of women, they needed to stay in the home to take care of the children and household chores.

>What laws do they not have?

I'll list a few others may not have listed. In many countries and states transgender people are denied donating blood, they're denied health care, they're denied jobs. In Poland, for instance, transgender people have to sue their parents in order to change their legal name in the documents. Not to mention transgender people get locked up strictly for being transgender in hillbilly countries. Trans rights is not solely about USA, and their rights differ all around the world, in some places transgender people are forced to live in hiding and in other places they stay homeless forever."
