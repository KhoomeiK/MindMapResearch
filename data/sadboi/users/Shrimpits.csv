In high school and early college I was eating like garbage all the time. Luckily, in a sense, I am a hardgainer so I never put on much weight but was constantly eating sugary and fatty foods and I pretty much had to take a nap every day or else I was falling asleep in class.

Once I started getting all my macros and micros in, it really helped. That, plus exercising in general. I got to a point then where I couldn’t remember the last time
I took a nap. Also, for me, going to bed early and waking up early really helped too."

Every now and then a memory will hit me while I’m driving or minding my own business, and no matter how hard I try I can’t shake it and I break down and it haunts me for awhile. Im a much better person now and I know people grow, but damn, I just don’t know why I did certain things that I did."

crappyanimalcrossing,fqzt5g2,t3_glsl64,1589774763.0,"Nice! I did the same thing for the most part - kept my islands shape mostly the same - terraformed a little bit but nothing crazy (added/removed an extra pond here or there, adjusted a spot where I put my museum, moved trees around) and then turned what I had into a town with terracotta paths. I did download a few custom designs but didn’t go crazy with anything.

I got a 5 star rating pretty quickly tbh and it stayed that way (currently have 5 Lily of the Valley flowers from it). I feel the same as you though, I found it a bit surprising that a lot of people who did crazy terraforming and planning aren’t at a 5-star level. I almost think the game wants it to be more organic like we did it, however, it’s cool that they will let you do whatever you want regardless.

All in all I just want people to have fun no matter how they play though. I made some comments on other posts before that it kind of bums me out how so many people seem stressed about terraforming/designing/arranging their islands.

Maybe if I had a bigger house with an office and a family things would be different, but I’m in my late 20’s in a small ass apartment with a roommate trying to both work in the living room. Kind of just feels claustrophobic. HOWEVER, I love seeing sunlight during the day. That’s one thing that I think is great - I can open up my windows and let a breeze in and see sunlight. Nothing depresses me more than a dark office haha.

Still though, I miss talking to people. I miss seeing people. I actually enjoy when people come up and ask questions / “bug” me at my desk.

Before corona or anything else going on, I could have a social life outside of my apartment. It was kind of strange though, at least for me-

Like, it would be a Tuesday evening and all my friends would be coming home from work and I’d be like “Hey guys let’s go out and do something!” But most people would decline because they just wanted to relax at home after being in their office all day. In a weird way I felt more stir crazy because of that fact whereas now we’re all kind of going through this together so to me it doesn’t feel as bad. Hard to explain via typing haha."

Basically got the response I expected - he wasn’t sure, but he said it would follow the same rules of the city, which I’m assuming will be after these 3 months.

I enjoy the drive to work to get in that mindset, work hard, decompress on my way home, then relax at home. Similar to working out, I just can’t get into that mindset.

bodyweightfitness,fq1vfah,t3_ggh3bu,1589049923.0,"I’m definitely not the pinnacle of perfect health by any means, but as an ectomorph / hard gainer here are some things I learned as I progressed:

Fun story first: first time going into a gym was around 2012. I got trapped into the whole personal trainer thing because I didn’t really know what I was doing (actually glad I got one at first though as it taught me a lot about routines and certain workouts). I obviously wanted to gain muscle since I was so skinny, but I didn’t realize that diet was an important factor - tbh I thought I should eat less and workout a lot more. My first workout with the trainer, he asked me what I had eaten that day, and I proudly stated “Oh, I only had a pear today!” And I will never forget the look he gave me hahaha. Just sheer concern and confusion. We then had a long talk about diet and how I should be eating A LOT more of I wanted to gain any muscle.

- Initially I was doing a lot of workouts on machines that isolated things like arms, legs, etc. and wasn’t seeing great results. It wasn’t until I switched to squats, bench press, dead lifts, etc. - compound workouts - with a few isolated workouts peppered in where friends/family and I started to notice me actually looking more buff.

- Even though I’m a hard gainer, I wish I ran a bit more, or at least did something with cardio. At the very least, wish I would have done a day of hard cardio a week. As much as it’s nice looking buff and not losing gains, heart health is important, and since I’m already prone to anxiety and genetic high blood pressure, I’m noticing more cardiovascular issues as I age. I pretty much avoided cardio at all costs when starting out.

- Don’t be afraid to ask for a spotter or help at the gym. I had an embarrassing experience when I first started where I was using the bench press and tried to up the weight. My noodle arms collapsed on me and the bar came down on my chest and I couldn’t get it back up. Luckily some people ran over and helped me, but man did I feel embarrassed.

- It took me some time finding the best routine for me. I would often get discouraged when I first started out and end up only going to the gym once a week, or maybe like twice a week at two random times. I finally found that going Mon Tue Thur Fri early in the morning was the most ideal for me personally (switching around the areas of my body that I worked out).

- My diet has been evolving for years. However, it wasn’t until recently when I switched around a staple time of eating and realized it was a lot better for me. For years I would wake up early and pound down a high-calorie shake of oatmeal, milk, fruit, protein powder, sometimes eggs, etc. A lot of days I’d have to muscle it down since it was quite a bit of food haha. THEN after eating I’d workout at the gym. Recently I found out that I get a better workout in if I stick to coffee and a banana in the morning and then eat my high-cal nutritious shake afterwards. Basically, it’s good to explore this type of thing and constantly evolve I think."

If I remember correctly in that game you really couldn’t do much other than the basics like fish, collect fruit, fossils and bugs, and buy and sell furniture. You could decorate and upgrade your house but that was it (as far as customization goes).  I continued playing that game for years even after I had fully upgraded my house. Albeit, I was 10 years old when it first came out and didn’t do much other than go to school, but I still enjoyed playing it long after I had beaten the game (just not every single day). I think maybe because I always enjoyed the surprises that holidays would bring and random things I found out later on, I always wanted to keep playing.

Now that I’m older and the internet has destroyed my attention span, I wonder if I’ll do the same with this game. It just seems like nowadays people need that instant satisfaction and gratification of finishing up an island and making it look perfect right away which really wasn’t as prevalent 20 years ago (at least imo)."

AskLosAngeles,fozru3u,t3_gah5th,1588195758.0,"This perspective my help (or not) as I was in a similar boat but almost the exact opposite. Here is my story:

I grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania, lived there for 18 years. I moved to Pittsburgh after high school in order to pursue college. Lived there for 5 years and I loved it. It was far away enough from my hometown (4 hour drive) that I felt independent but could always easily take a Friday evening to drive back if needed. It felt good to be in the city with so many things to offer as compared to the little backwoods town I grew up in.

However, around age 24 I felt a bit stagnant. I loved Pittsburgh but felt like I needed a new horizon. The industry I wanted to work in (and eventually found a job in!) was in LA so I packed my things and moved out here. Have lived here since 2016, working in my field, and tbh, I’m heavily considering moving back in about a year or so. SoCal just isn’t really for me, I can’t relate to the people, the beaches are nice/the weather’s nice but it just doesn’t feel like home to me. Even the industry I moved out here for is not really what I expected/hoped it would be.

HOWEVER, I’m so glad I moved here. I learned a lot and definitely grew as a person. Even though I miss my east coast climate, I’m still proud I took the steps to move somewhere completely different than what I was used to.

All-in-all I probably didn’t have to type my life story to tell you that I think it’s a great idea to move away for a bit, even if you plan on coming back. I’d find a place where you think you’d enjoy, even if it doesn’t have everything you’re looking for, and try it out for a few years. If you’re in a specific industry I’d recommend doing research to see if other cities/places have jobs in that field. Also, like someone else said, nothing will really compare to LA - for better or worse - so you really will just have to go out and see for yourself if you’d enjoy living somewhere else or not. Even doing the first step like I did and moving just far enough away to be able to drive back on weekends (if you’d want) might not be a bad idea to see how you feel.

Hope you’re able to figure it all out regardless of what you do :)"

I’m done with these lazy ass villagers not helping haha no one on my island appreciates me! I’m just going to start focusing on my own house now"
NintendoSwitch,foxgn58,t1_fowgct8,1588143406.0,"Ah okay, that’s good to know about their repair shop being closed in the interim.

I’m glad you got a solution in the meantime though! I debated buying a new pair. I’d like to have another pair for playing certain games with friends anyway, so I think I’m going to do that, but I am worried about them getting messed up if I start using them for ACNH (which I would want to do to not deal with this drift).

Yeah it’s whacky to me that something like that passed through everyone at Nintendo. I guess maybe it’s a hindsight thing, but I feel like some engineer would have flagged it at some point. Honestly I feel like most digital and electronic apparatuses are engineered very specifically to NOT get anything inside.

All-in-all I just want to vent because I’m tired of not catching bugs (wasps and tarantulas) and missing money rock hits because my dude randomly spins around or runs away haha"
NintendoSwitch,fovzeth,t1_fnb7gj5,1588110221.0,"I'm worried about this too.

I just got my Switch this past Christmas and never experienced any drift. I started playing Animal Crossing, about a week or so into it the drift was only very slight and only happened occasionally. It started getting worse and worse to the point where I had to google what was happening, and I found the Q-tip solution. Did that, fixed the drift for like two days, then it started again. Now I've pretty much been having to do it every day, but it goes back to drifting in like an hours time and it's much worse than it ever was before (happening in multiple directions). I want to send the joycon in but with how much I've been doing the Q-tip thing, I think maybe they'll say it's my fault and not fix it."
vfx,foqz1jv,t3_g8tty4,1588003317.0,"I think a lot of small and mid size companies will slowly roll it out for certain individuals. Big companies might not as much. I doubt it will go to 100% remote work, but who knows.

Personally there are so many pros and cons for me.
So far what I’ve enjoyed about WFH is seeing sunlight all day, the relaxed vibe, hanging out with my cat more (I know - lol), no commute. However, I miss my VFX boys and girls. I miss talking to people face to face. I would rather stand up and walk to ask someone a question than send an email and wait. If the commute isn’t too bad (45 min or less) I actually kind of like it since it helps to mentally prepare for the day and decompress after the day. You don’t really get that with WFH.

From what I’m seeing in the thread some people have been loving it and others hating it. All-in-all it would just be nice to have the option to choose"

AskLosAngeles,fn8hob5,t3_g02q5a,1586741879.0,"So I had a weird experience throughout December into early January that I couldn’t really explain, but I’m starting to think more and more that maybe I had an early strain of it (obviously won’t know until testing is more available like you said).

I did this event in Venice beach late November where I was around a ton of people and then flew back East for Thanksgiving and came back. In December I started getting weird symptoms - extreme shortness of breath (couldn’t walk up the stairs without taking a breather), along with that my heart was beating so fast all day everyday if I did anything remotely physical, and I developed a light cold that lasted for a few days at some point. I was thinking it was all from a sinus infection but was surprised it lasted as long as it did. In Jan it went away.

Normally I’m pretty active, and something a simple as walking up a small flight of stairs is nothing for me, so this was particularly scary as I couldn’t understand why I felt like I could never catch my breath and my heart would be beating so hard I could feel it in my chest. I will say I never developed any flu symptoms as far as stomach issues or aches though, so maybe not. All I know is that entire month I felt weird and out of it because of the breathing issues."

Do the villagers leave an empty house behind when they leave the island? And does someone just randomly move in then like the original AC? Or do you have to use a Nook mikes ticket and talk to someone visiting that island or talk to a camper?

I just beat the main story and have my first neighbor leaving tomorrow so I’m curious haha"
gaming,fmyxrrn,t3_fy1uj8,1586499129.0,"Don’t forget about Animal Crossing!

For real though, it’s kinda cool, kinda weird, kinda nostalgic.

Unfortunately my brain is wired to wake up early from years of waking up at 6 - 7am so I’ll stay up really late to play Warzone with the boys, but then I can’t really sleep past 8 - 9am. I will then jump on Animal Crossing for an hour or so and then try to get more sleep haha."
spookyblack,fmyr3y1,t3_fy5kv7,1586493293.0,"Oh shit! This video brings back good memories. Right around the end of college (end of 2014 - early 2015) my friends and I first got into Corbin. Being the ripe young age of 22 we’d pretty much pregame and go out to the bars every Friday and Saturday night, and every pregame for awhile there we’d play Couch Potato on YouTube. This song/video would always come on afterwards (which is how I first heard of it). I didn’t realize it was unlisted tbh, but going to save the link so I don’t lose it! Thank you!"
AnimalCrossing,fmv5jah,t3_fxgrjl,1586406643.0,"Back before I had internet to look it up, in the original AC, I spent hours just resetting my game and turning it back on because I thought something special would happen with Resetti if I did it over and over.

gaming,fmta5if,t1_fmt7kov,1586369325.0,"Yeah, agreed, watch for patterns. If you have google spreadsheet or excel you can make a simple line graph that charts the sell prices (I also point out buy prices but haven’t been playing long enough to see a pattern for buy).

For the past two weeks my turnip sell prices are at the highest mid-week and lowest Saturday/Monday. However, they haven’t gotten up to 500+ bells, I think the highest I’ve seen for me was 170 bells"

When he said that I was like “wait... did I miss an episode??” but then I read the season episode list and assumed it would be later on. I’m guessing they wanted to keep the double-episode thing near the end like they’ve done with other seasons, so they kept that line in as a way of foreshadowing (or pre-shadowing ??), but who knows haha"

Unfortunately the munchies is strong in me, so if I do smoke/take an edible/etc. it’s better for me to do it right before going to bed or not at all if I want to maintain my diet haha. Honestly I am cutting back since I know it causes me to forego discipline, and like you said, I want to keep my immune system up just in case.

If you haven’t had a cheat meal in that long though I’d say go for it! Mental health and physical health run hand in hand, and sometimes, especially times like this, we need some comfort food. Obviously overdoing it is bad, but it’s nice to have a cheat meal occasionally!"
Fitness,fm58aid,t1_fm57v3w,1585768167.0,"Yeah that’s smart. Admittedly my first week of quarantine almost felt like a vacation (even though I was working from home). I would stay up late, get stoned, eat junk food, etc.

This past weekend I went out and got healthy groceries so I’ve been a bit better, but I can already tell that week has set me back haha. Oh well, I guess what can I do other than try and be better going forward."
Fitness,fm4pwlf,t1_fm4oqx8,1585758636.0,For sure! I am starting to do a couple things like going to bed earlier so I can wake up earlier (a bad habit I formed once quarantine happened was staying up late knowing I could wake up late) and I found that that did help today.
Fitness,fm4j135,t3_fswz4a,1585755069.0,"Same as everyone else, I miss the gym haha.

I just can’t find motivation to work out at home. Not sure why. Even just doing body weight push-ups, dips, squats every day would be better than me just sitting all day, but for some reason I have this weird mental block where I procrastinate and then don’t do anything. I think the gym is ideal since I can easily get myself to go, and then once I’m there I can’t do anything but work out. When I’m at home it just doesn’t feel right.

At least once this is all over my gym workouts will feel incredible again. I’m excited to feel extremely sore once more."

gaming,flt6uas,t3_fqybjk,1585461152.0,"It helps me a bit to only buy one game at a time. Buy it, fully enjoy it, repeat with another. Even if 3 good games all come out at the same time, I just prefer owning one and playing it until I’m content and then getting the next. FOMO sucks though so I try to avoid things like Reddit when I know I’m not playing a game along with everyone else.

Also, it’s good to have a mix of different types of games. Right now I’m playing Animal Crossing if I want to explore/build/take it easy and then Warzone for MW if I want to just hop in to something quick and play a few rounds."

treedibles,fkhkiu5,t3_fickxj,1584200811.0,"Just bought these for the first time last night!

I love their chocolate chip cookies so I was excited to try these. Red velvet flavor is great, not artificial tasting. A little bit of weed taste but not overwhelming. High was perfect, didn’t feel too high at any point and was able to focus really well (maybe due to the guarana). Kicked in after about an hour, peaked around 3 hours for me.

Basically, same opinion as OP - would highly recommend!"
Fitness,fk7f30g,t3_fgurw7,1583935090.0,"*Rant regarding myself since these are all changes I can personally make*

Been stuck in this skinny fat yet muscular phase for a while now. If I wear a tank top I actually look buff (to the point of getting compliments which is cool), but if I wear a t-shirt I look like a twig, and if I have my shirt off I have a bit of a stomach and some slight man boobs.

Ultimately I just need to eat cleaner and can solve a majority of this problem. I used to be so good about it, but for some reason lately I’ve been lazy meal prepping and have been eating out more.

Also, I’ve been using my apartment complex’s gym because it’s available and I’m trying to get the most out of my rent, but it doesn’t have heavy compound lifts like barbell bench press or a squat rack, etc. - mostly free weights and machines. The reason I don’t go to an actual gym anymore is because the city I’m in now has the most crowded gyms at all times of day (it seems) whereas where I lived before you could go at 6:30 in the morning and no one would be there (plus it’s more expensive here). This is definitely an excuse and I should just man up but I WANT TO RANT REGARDLESS! Lol"
