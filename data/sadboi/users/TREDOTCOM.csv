My boss rates me on me meeting/exceeding my deliverables at the end of the year and doesn’t micro manage.  He knocks down political barriers for me as needed, but beyond that he stays out of my way.  If I get my job done, my reward is schedule flexibility.

I make enough money to support my lifestyle.  I never take my job home with me.  Zero stress.  Honestly, you couldn’t pay me 50k more to leave.  The work-life balance is good.  Until that changes, I’ll stick around.

Finally, I have a sense of pride working at Boeing.  I know we have had a very hard two years, and our brand may take years to recover.  I want to be the guy who stuck around and helped Boeing climb out of the rut."

MadeMeSmile,fkawf3o,t3_fhef0e,1584021021.0,"Right on, man.  The number one thing I like to tell those suffering in some of the mental illness forums is that there is a right treatment out there for everyone, you just have to find it.  It is easier said than done, but it DOES exist for each person.  Be it therapy, the right cocktail of medication, or both. 

Now, if we could just get everyone access to this stuff!  I truly believe half of the homeless population is homeless simply because they lost employment (due to their illness), which caused a loss in med insurance, which caused their Illness to go untreated, making their mental state worse while landing them on the street.  

Some are fortunate and have family that can intervene in a circumstance where coverage is lost, but for those without that help, losing coverage means losing themselves; All of which is completely unnecessary and tragic.  

I’ve made it a point to help others like myself(who suffer from Mental Illness) but who don’t have the financial independence I was born with, because of examples I’ve read and encountered like yours.  EVERYONE has a treatment, sometimes they just need the right person to help them find it.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fkavckx,t3_fh9q6u,1584020340.0,"Dude.  Yes.  And I’m saying that as a LIBERTARIAN.  Let’s give it a real shot and see where it lands us.  Maybe it ends up being horrible, but maybe not.  It won’t kill us to give it a go.  

All I know is this... while Capitalism in its most basic form is beautiful in theory, we have never actually had it in the US.  I blame this on the fact that corporations essentially have the ability/power to write their own laws (which cannot exist in a purely capitalistic nation without bastardizing the classical political economy paradigm).  The people no longer influence their representatives, companies with deep pockets do.  At the very least, this needs to be fixed.

Now, all of that is why I like Bernie.  He cannot be bought; he is a true ‘untouchable’, in my opinion.  If he can win, tackle tax evasion, save healthcare (painful, and will get worse before getting better), and make Wall-street bail our nation out of student debt, the economy will flourish.  We bailed out Wall St; now it is time for them to help out their country.  Shit, student debt forgiveness could be forgiven without raising taxes on a single person.

Having Bernie, a true man of the people, in the highest of offices, would subtly influence voters to seek out and demand new blood in Congress, which is where real change can happen.  We need our Congressmen/women to be untouchable as well, doing ONLY the bidding of their district and those residing in it.  That’s how we make America truly prosperous again.

That’s all.  Thanks for reading if you managed to find this buried in here."

”In a strange house, 
a strange bed 
in a strange town, 
a very strange me 
is waiting for you. 

Now 
it is very early in the morning. 
The silence is loud. 
The baby is walking about 
with his foaming bottle, 
making strange sounds 
and deciding, after all, 
to be my friend. 

You 
arrive tonight. 

How dull time is! 
How empty—and yet, 
since I am sitting here, 
lying here, 
walking up and down here, 
waiting, 
I see 
that time's cruel ability 
to make one wait 
is time's reality. 

I see your hair 
which I call red. 
I lie here in this bed. 

Someone teased me once, 
a friend of ours— 
saying that I saw your hair red 
because I was not thinking 
of the hair on your head. 

Someone also told me, 
a long time ago: 
my father said to me, 
It is a terrible thing, 
son, 
to fall into the hands of the living God. 
Now, 
I know what he was saying. 
I could not have seen red 
before finding myself 
in this strange, this waiting bed. 
Nor had my naked eye suggested 
that colour was created 
by the light falling, now, 
on me, 
in this strange bed, 
waiting 
where no one has ever rested! 

The streets, I observe, 
are wintry. 
It feels like snow. 
Starlings circle in the sky, 
conspiring, 
together, and alone, 
unspeakable journeys 
into and out of the light. 

I know 
I will see you tonight. 
And snow 
may fall 
enough to freeze our tongues 
and scald our eyes. 
We may never be found again! 

Just as the birds above our heads 
circling 
are singing, 
knowing 
that, in what lies before them, 
the always unknown passage, 
wind, water, air, 
the failing light 
the failing night 
the blinding sun 
they must get the journey done. 
Listen. 
They have wings and voices 
are making choices 
are using what they have. 
They are aware 
that, on long journeys, 
each bears the other, 
whirring, 
stirring 
love occuring 
in the middle of the terrifying air.”
