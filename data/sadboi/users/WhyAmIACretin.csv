SuicideWatch,fqrzqqe,t3_gk7spi,1589595384.0,"I can understand where you are coming from, being so sure that you are going to end it all without doubt. I believe that suicide is so frowned upon and hard to pull off safely, is because the quickest ways, could be abused and used to hurt others. I mean there's also the fact that the art of killing a human being is not easy. Phineas Gage survived a god damn rod through his head! Even the US' death row death sentences rarely work 100% of the time. Honestly bro, I'm feeling pretty shitty myself. I think the way I'll go out is wait till I can join the military. If I die, so be it, If it survive, whatever. At least you'll leave this earth with what people see as honor. Crazy how sick this world is that our youth has to go through these thoughts of death. I'm 16 years old and I don't know if a day goes by where I'm not thinking about death. The future scares me, the thought of not being able to fit into this society that we have made for ourselves. The constant thought of just being a disappointment, having to deal with shitty people, i'm only 16 years in and it'll only get worse right? These are supposed to be my good years? Socially i'm doing fine, and physically I'm good, but shit man I'd trade all of it away for a clear consciousness.  There isn't a moment in my life that I'm not stressing out about the future. I'm gonna stick it out though. There's potential in every human being I think. It's like a waste of life. If I die, i'm at least going out with a bang. I don't mean that as in like some crazy shit, I mean that as in I'm going to try and leave a legacy for myself, and my family. To be completely honest, I'm most scared that the afterlife will be boring. Like it'll just be darkness for all of eternity. That's literally fucking torture. It scares me so much that it makes me throw suicide out the window fast. No matter how much I want to die, the thought of death consumes me, It scares the shit out of me. Then I think, which is worse? Possibly an eternity of darkness and boredom, or I can ride out this insane ass world, no matter how cruel it may be. I know i got really convoluted towards the end, because i just started spewing whatever was on my mind, but that's how I keep myself from fucking killing myself."
