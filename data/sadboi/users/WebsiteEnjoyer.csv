over60,fll7iat,t1_flkuzsa,1585255055.0,Exactly. I think the people who are struggling the most with it mentally are people who are used to going out every night and don't really know how to keep themselves company.

nosurf,flb4x92,t3_flvsxo,1584997458.0,"Yes!! I realized this too, and it actually really helped to put the situation in perspective for me.

The panic we're seeing everywhere is not just people's reaction to a pandemic, it's their reaction to being forced to sit with their thoughts for the first time in their adult life.

They've been cut off from the things that make them feel like they're keeping up with everyone else, and even now they're trying to get a buzz from showing off that they're quarantining the right way!!"
over60,fklrne5,t3_fj6wws,1584313080.0,"Hi! 🙋🏻‍♀️I found this sub from a discussion about the coronavirus. I'm a pretty introverted 25 year old, just moved to a new town and shopping is usually my social contact for the day. Facebook groups have been really great for meeting people and feeling like someone's on the other end of the phone! If there are any podcasts or tv shows you enjoy especially, there are really active groups to discuss them and the virus is on everyone's mind right now so you can definitely find someone to chat with!"

LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fk8p431,t1_fk24fb6,1583960225.0,I think people have used Carlton's other bad behavior (blowing up on her) to hide their real feelings about bisexuality. I'm part of some Facebook groups and the conversation around it is...bad!!!
Anxiety,fk6oe18,t1_fk6nk7w,1583909132.0,"I can't tell if you have the virus but I can tell you with certainty that you've been consuming a lot of negative content recently. That can cause headaches. 

I can also tell you that Reddit has people who are actively rooting for this to be a collapse scenario because it would validate their own situation.

That's not even taking into consideration trolls and those acting in bad faith.

You can take my word for it because I'm on this thread too. I'm not in denial, I don't think it's just a flu, I'm here because I'm scared.  

But feelings are temporary. 

Do not make any decisions right now. Drink a glass of water. Drink another. 

You have survived everything you've ever been through."
Anxiety,fk6meqc,t1_fk6lwxa,1583906953.0,"Don't. You're needed here. 

Trust me when I say this. 

Look up interviews with people who've survived suicide attempts. They all say they immediately regretted their decision once they jump."
Anxiety,fjzakgu,t1_fjxysey,1583715202.0,Yes!!!
Anxiety,fj8ztlw,t3_fbq6n2,1583127080.0,"🙋🏻‍♀️I also grew up with introverted parents and a social older sibling! In my house staying in was definitely the default, we didn't really do activities except going out to dinner.

Sometimes I'll have what I think is a really productive/social day and then check Instagram and realize what's a big day for me is my friends' baseline. I related so much to what you said about your core group not being their core group. It's really really hard.

But I will tell you this: you are not lazy. You are in a situation that would make anyone feel lonely and unmotivated. It's natural, it's not a personal flaw or lack of willpower as much as MLM people would have you think. It's a human reaction to not getting what you're wired to need.

Our generation has it really hard, and if this thread is any proof you're not alone in this."
