Throughoht most of the tragectory, water is reabsorved, but the biggest amount usually reabsorved is right at the end of the tubulation. The thing is, this last part can only reabsorb water into your bloodstream if there's ADH, a hormone that basically put the doors at the cell surface for the water to pass through. Since alcohol inhibits ADH, you will produce way more pee than usual since you won't be reabsorving a lot of water, and it won't stop until the hormone get's back to work. So, after the alcohol starts working, your bladder will be getting more and more pee."

I could be wrong, of course, and as you said, Sam will pull out all the big guns and convince me that the sci-fi route was the way to go.

Adressing that, I really don't get all the ""the series always pointed to sci-fi since season 2"". It didn't? It had casting choices that teased the idea of something like TIME TRAVEL, and characters convinced that it could be possible that were COMPLETELY BROKEN INSIDE.
