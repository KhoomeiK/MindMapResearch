In the past, I would be super interested in someone for about a week or two, then I just completely lost interest and wanted nothing to do with that person; my theory is that my unconscious was trying to protect me because I was afraid and masked it as disinterest.  After a while of that, I developed a debilitating fear of being with a man; didn't want sex, emotions, any of it, so I came out as a lesbian and cut men out completely.  Recently, I've come to terms with the fact that it was simply my trauma interfering with my relationships and decided not to let it take hold over my life like that.  Now, I am exploring the possibility of allowing myself to feel (or be) with a man.  I can't say I've made progress yet, but just know that you are not alone and I am rooting for you :)"

There’s also a graduate programs in psychology book that I’ve used a lot to weed out what programs I’m interested in, I advise looking through the 2019 one and narrowing down your choices; it provides information like gre scores, funding, gpa, how many letters of rec, etc. Good luck!"
