airedaleterrier,fr2rkf6,t1_fr2g10e,1589842533.0,"They are exceedinly head strong so you're right; even the best treat is hardly going to deflect their attention. When I walk my dog on a lead, I have her wear a head harness.
https://www.k9ofmine.com/best-dog-head-halters/

It gives me control over what she sees, and allows me to make sure I have HER attention. She doesn't like it much, but if another dog comes into view, I know I can get her to sit and watch without a sound. She has given up on the pulling and lunging because she knows that it will get uncomfortable. Consider it. I have no experience with a shock collar so I don't know about that. No reason other than I didn't want to spend the money on it only to find that it didn't work. Maybe it might work so if you're good with the money, go for it. 

As for the growling, just remember the cause/effect thing. Once she figures out that she will immediately (and I mean absolutely immediately) get removed to a less fun place, she will stop. And that goes for all behavior. They are VERY dog intelligent, and will always be on alert for the cause/effect principle, even if you're not thinking about it, so you'll have to be absolutely consistent with it. 

It sounds kind of harsh, but I believe in the alpha leader principles. I'm the alpha woman, and my dog knows it. All good things come from me. Hell to pay comes from me. I use no violence, but she knows tone, and that's enough to get a response. No people food at all. None, ever. She's never developed the understanding that it's food. She waits for her dog food (once a day) until after I've eaten. Play comes from me. Rewards come from me. There is no room in the world for her to think for herself unless I give her permission. She LOVES the sense of security knowing her place in the pecking order. 

Anyhoo. They are great, great dogs, and so capable. Good luck with yours!"

airedaleterrier,fr27wot,t1_fr21j09,1589832675.0,"Ok. I don't think she's sick. 

This is just my opinion, so take it for that. I've owned three Airedales, all female, one from puppy to ancient adult, and two adopted at a young age. 

We tend to view dog behavior through human minds, and what we usually do is anthropomorphize it. That isn't how dogs think or work. They are cause and effect animals pure and simple. If they get a response for a certain behavior enough times, then they know that if they do A, they will get B. That's why dog behavior is easy to modify using the reward system. 

There are some great dog training videos on Youtube that you might consider watching about this. Zac George is one of them.

One other thing, and this is more controversial, but negative reinforcement also works, in that if a dog knows that a certain behavior will bring down the alpha dog on them, then they cease the behavior. Think of how Alpha dogs keep their pack in line. Negative reinforcement for bad behavior. If a dog thinks there's a payoff to counter surf, and the cost is just being yelled at, then they are going to take that bet every day. They grow accustomed to the yelling because the payoff for the act is FOOD. So yelling stops being effective. 

I use separation as the outcome for any negative behavior, and it's immediate and long enough to make a point. I don't use her crate as the place to separate her because that's her little cozy place, but the garage. No comfy place other than a hard cement floor to lie down on. No toys. No chewies. Nothing. And nothing will get her back in the house with us; no barking or whining, or other pleading. Remember, they are cause and effect creatures, Cause and effect. Surf? Out you go. Bark? Out you go. Growl or bare teeth? DEFINITELY out you go. 

The overall idea is that the payoff for good behavior has to be there, and the negative response also has to be there. Immediate and consistent. You and your husband have to agree to this, and the rules, so that your dog won't figure out that one of you isn't likely to enforce the rules. 

BTW, if you don't have a garage, then a bathroom will do. Or utility room. If they start chewing on the door, or making ANY noise, then a stern response is necessary. 

Rules might be:
No couch at all, EVER. If they're on the couch, then they're immediately in the garage.

No growling, at all. EVER. If they do, then banished to the garage. Immediately.
Game playing, YES. Reward good play with some kind of treat. ALWAYS if possible. Good behavior gets GOOD dog a reward!
Attention? Not if there's any growling of any kind. If there's ANY growling its banished from wherever you are to wherever you want them. 
Counter surfing? IMMEDIATE banishment. No ""cutie talk like OH YOU BAD BAD LITTLE DOG. Nothing. Just instant banishment. 

When they start to get it...you'll see a change pretty quickly. 

And just to reiterate, this is from years of airedales, but it's my opinion as to how to go about it. Others may have different ways of dealing..."

If I'm eating, I ask what's good. 
I usually only start a conversation with staff if they don't look too busy. And then it's ""so what's the news today? Anything good to report? Or...so tell me about this place.

""are you here every day? What do you do on your off time? Are you a sports nut? What team? 

I just have no fear starting conversations. If they go nowhere, then thats a bartender that won't be getting repeat business.

Ask questions. Whats good here? Ask them about themselves, things like ""how long have you been here? etc. 

Edit: I forgot to add that getting to know the bartender(s) is a great way to feel like you belong. There's a bit of a ""Cheers"" effect; the ""where someone knows your name"" kind of thing. It makes you feel welcomed, and included. The best bartenders will also keep an eye on you more and alert you to ""issues"" . Where I go, the bartender is like a social director, making introductions to the other regulars when he sees it. 

Sometimes (and rarely), it's kind of lonely sitting at the bar by myself but mostly people are open to conversation about this or that, and I usually never find myself lacking in people to talk to, even it it's just staff.
