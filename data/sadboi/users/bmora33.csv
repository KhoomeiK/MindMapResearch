What I am getting at is that nothing seems to make that numbing sensation towards life and just being exhausted having to carry out things simple because you have to go away. All that superficial stuff like finding a career that makes you feel accomplished i, relationships, or money isn't the problem. The path where im headed is where I want to be. 

But the enjoyment that we are suppose to have fore life in general isn't. It's like I dissociate at times. I don't know how to explain it to you."

I hate to sound like I'm just turning everyone's advice away but honestly I'm the type of person that loves to be alone and without a significant other. My heart simply isn't aching for that love or attention, and I'm currently 24.being single is what is best for me. maybe it'll change in 5+ years but I honestly can't see myself being with somebody but I have never been in love with someone to begin with. 

 I do have a dog however and wow, I can't tell you how much he means to me and you're right idk what I'm going to do after he is gone.  

Thanks again."

Even though I am working towards my dream job, I've already been submersed into adulthood early on in my college career.

Makeup,fagi2be,t3_e912pp,1576056053.0,"You have really nice skin! I would find out what you think your features are abd bring them out!
Highlighter! I would definitely try doing that. Your eyebrows are nice and thick. I would go to ulta and ask to get them trimmed and shaped to your face, eyebrows can really change up how your face looks when done right.
I would also try new hairstyles, you have beautiful curly hair! I would grow out your bangs and grow our your hair from the shoulders.
Those are some tips i can think of. Also i would try mascara or false eyelashes!
I can't tell you  how many times I've done my makeup and until I've done my lashes then i look put together. Eyebrows and lashes.
I would also start looking for products that will lighten (even out skin tone)and tighten your skin collagen and vitamin c and e oil is great!
I wouldnt do anythinf but bb creams on your skin! Concealer at most because you have nice natural skin! Remember to get a setting powder .
That second picture you took is actually pretty good! I think, you think you're more unattractive than you actually are. You're a pretty girl!"

I use to do that and I ran into the problem of only being able to work a certain of amount of hours because of how much financial aid they gave through it.

While I realize you might not be good at biology maybe you can grow to like the medical field.

If you really don't want to pursue it, you should have a sit down with your parents and express your concerns, I know some parents don't understand but that's a start. While it's slow it's definitely possible to pay for school out of pocket that might require you to do community College and then a university or taking out loans but it's possible.

If you have any interest in any subject that's mention I would role with it and discover what you can do with it that might please your parents. You can do that while still taking biology classes or psychology classes. 
I didn't really know what I wanted to do until early on to my junior year. I would also talk to different department majors that you might be interested in and ask their take because my advisor wasn't very helpful until I got my department advisor. Good luck! You'll figure it out"
