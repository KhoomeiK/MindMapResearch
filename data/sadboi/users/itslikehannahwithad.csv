BipolarReddit,fqa23ff,t3_ghjdk9,1589211431.0,"You are so far from being alone... I‚Äôm sorry if you do feel alone. I identify with this. 

But just know, people who are ‚Äúsick‚Äù, often do not know they‚Äôre sick... it‚Äôs common for people with bipolar (bipolar 1 here!!) to think they‚Äôre not sick... that they don‚Äôt need the medication... or even that they‚Äôre somehow just failing as a person. 

You aren‚Äôt failing as a person though. Bipolar disorder is VERY real. Just as real as any physical ailment. Often times, it can CAUSE physical ailments, even. All from something we suffer with, but cannot see. 

Bipolar doesn‚Äôt define you. It doesn‚Äôt define me. We give ourselves a fighting chance by taking the meds when we are supposed to, even if, at times, we don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs necessary. We deserve to give ourselves a fighting chance against something that... in all truthfulness, fights back, with a helluva punch. 

I‚Äôm sorry you feel this way. It‚Äôs good to let it all out. It‚Äôs healthy. 

If you ever need someone to talk to, please PM me. I am happy to be there for you."

This is touching and makes me shed a tear for you.. for your heartache.. My mother passed away when I was younger. I empathize for you - this time of the year can be more difficult than most. Keep your head up and always try to remember that she is always with you, in spirit. A guardian angel, if that‚Äôs something you believe in. 

Also, it‚Äôs so important to remember grieving is healthy as well. It‚Äôs part of the healing process.. Allow yourself to heal. You deserve that. 

Much love to you, from a random internet stranger <3"

Your story was immensely inspiring!

Glad I‚Äôm not alone when the ‚Äúmaybe it wasn‚Äôt that bad..‚Äù thoughts come to haunt me. 

Truthfully, it WAS that bad. Probably worse than I give it credit for. I‚Äôm not perfect by any means, but my most recent relationship was so abusive.. I‚Äôm still sorting through the trauma it caused me and probably will be for a LONG time. That‚Äôs ok... at least I‚Äôm working through sorting it out. 

Our situations weren‚Äôt the same, nor were our abusers.. but they shared so many similarities. I really relate to the withdrawing when throwing a fit, being able to suck the air out of the room... acting like a giant child. My abuser did all of that. Unfortunately, it got physical on top of being emotional and mental... but the past is the past and that chapter is closed. 

Glad to hear you are safe and healing. <3"

BipolarReddit,foig0r9,t1_foi4u7d,1587785774.0,"I really like the thought of this. Cus it feels so real and truly, like we are spiritually gifted. I was on this tangent when I was super manic a few months back (Bipolar 1 here! With severe psychosis :) )

I came to the discovery that we all have our own unique and spiritual gifts and was discovering my own as well as some close friends. It was lovely and I was so confident in it. 

Now that I‚Äôm no longer manic, I still find it believable (Christian - I grew up in the church and learned of ((and believe)) the spiritual gifts gifted to us by God through the Holy Spirit)

However, I think there are so many more undiscovered than the ones commonly named. 

Think of it as, spiritually gifted = empath (in some way, shape or form)"

He didn‚Äôt care the time of day... he thrived on my fear of him. It gave him power. It got to the point where he rigged my back door to where it wouldn‚Äôt shut all the way or lock... he could bust it open if he pleased (I stayed in the basement of my last house and the back door connected to my room through the laundry room) - only a deadbolt kept him from busting in.
