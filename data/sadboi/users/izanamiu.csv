mentalhealth,fjsq71w,t3_fexl5c,1583599517.0,YES intimacy is so crucial. you voicing your needs isn't complaining! whoever is saying that is not acknowledging your side on this which is just as important
mentalhealth,fjsnati,t3_fexeyv,1583598820.0,i'm here for you!
mentalhealth,fjq2tce,t3_ferlwi,1583566252.0,"do these relationships have depth though? do they challenge you, support you, satisfy you? what would a relationship where you feel loved and appreciated and heard look like?"
mentalhealth,fjnt48b,t3_feg9pi,1583513930.0,"hmm. maybe looking deeper into this, understanding what you want to control and why/where this need stems from could help. it is hella hard just to say to yourself 'you can't do shit about it' and pretend you don't care anymore. you do tho, acknowledge your concerns about whatever you are thinking about. deeper understanding sometimes helps to accept things!"
therapy,fjnoqa9,t3_fefpik,1583511657.0,i think it is very normal! i do the same ah. the feeling back then feels so good sometimes. are you content with your present life though? is there anything you feel you might lack but find it in your memories/activities that bring out those memories?
mentalhealth,fjh39hg,t3_fdfm3a,1583340389.0,i'm so sorry man. that must be such a difficult situation to be in :( i don't really have any great advice to give other than a lot of love and hugs to you. you never could have known. made the best decision you could at that exact moment.

therapy,fgwwfdf,t3_f0qyea,1581166545.0,"you have every right to feel upset, traumatized and all of the things that you're experiencing! i cannot fucking imagine hearing a professional who is there to help you, care for you, listen to you say that you're basically 'too much work'. to be rejected by the one who is actually supposed to help you. oh my gosh. i'm so sorry you went through that. your feelings are so valid."
therapy,fgvr17d,t1_fgvp8mi,1581152062.0,"what are your favorite ways to release emotion? i had this one friend who never expressed any anger to the man that constantly cheated on her. after three years, she finally arrived at his doorstep, faced him and in a way herself too, and expressed all that she couldn't throughout the years. shortly after she met someone and now they're living happily together. 
writing a physical letter can also be helpful. one to yourself & one to him. burning it after if you'd like haha

also, was there closure?"
therapy,fgvoscc,t1_fgvo8jk,1581151288.0,"damn, that must've been heartbreaking ): i understand you. it's almost like you want to trust again and love again but all the pain that you went through pushes you back"
therapy,fgvnlve,t3_f0orcd,1581151023.0,what motivates you to want to date & not to date?
mentalhealth,fgvj4iq,t3_f0omgk,1581149499.0,"yes, it shows their character and **only theirs**. the reason for this behavior is probably hate they project onto themselves and others around. jealousy. it is not your fault. perceiving beauty can be so biased. i personally believe you are an extremely beautiful woman. your features are pleasing to look at and it feels like all those people tried to point out the things they secretly enjoy looking at. i wonder how you feel about all of this though. how does it affect you? you only mentioned other people but how do *you* truly feel?"
mentalhealth,fgvdgf8,t3_f0nsxu,1581145606.0,"that's crazy! **YES**, you are allowed to feel paranoid and everything that you're feeling right now. it sounds like an actual criminal offence that needs to be reported"
mentalhealth,fgvbu2l,t1_fgvbbmy,1581143768.0,have you talked with him about that too?
mentalhealth,fgvb9sv,t1_fgvawcd,1581143150.0,"he really does mean a lot to you. it's so difficult loving someone who isn't able to reciprocate it back in the way that we truly enjoy. 
what, do you think, triggers the feeling of being a burden?"
mentalhealth,fgvat75,t1_fgvajuu,1581142661.0,"i'm sorry to hear that ): it'd be lovely to hear the other stories too. maybe it's an on-going pattern that keeps hurting you. you deserve to be with someone who communicates healthy, empathizes with your emotions and actually **takes** them into account."
mentalhealth,fgvaec3,t1_fgv9cku,1581142241.0,"wow that's a strong statement. does he give any real life examples to this?
i understand your sadness though. you must enjoy being around him and close to him which is crucial. it is sad when they go on to do their own things alone without giving a reason why. your feelings are so valid here and i don't see how it's manipulation. if anything, it could be the other way around and he's just blame shifting it on you."
therapy,fgv9miq,t3_f0nfai,1581141497.0,"i had 5 sessions to figure out abusive family stuff and during the 5th one, the therapist said ' you're mature to understand and deal with all of the emotions in a healthy way so i don't see a reason to continue seeing each other' 

it really does depend on a lot of personal factors. give it a try! during the few last sessions, you could ask the therapist to give you some tasks to work on at home on your own. some questions to ponder on or journal. like the other commenter said, supplementing does help a lot!"
mentalhealth,fgv98w9,t3_f0nfe6,1581141129.0,have you talked to him about it?
creepyencounters,fgv919l,t3_f0n40k,1581140919.0,"wow. that is truly scary. a fricking gun!
did you guys talk and if so, what were the conversations about? 
what expression did he give away?"
therapy,fgttf9s,t3_f0g7hc,1581109044.0,"maybe you just have a deep imagination or prefer learning, understanding things through visuals? 

this gets so entertaining when someone is telling a joke or something silly and you imagine it so well as if you're actually there! i'm a similar way too"
mentalhealth,fgtsdxe,t3_f0gevd,1581108661.0,i cry too even when life seems pretty normal. it is okay. it's like physically releasing emotions which feels good afterwards

mentalhealth,fgsaneg,t3_f09dka,1581078663.0,"you mentioned just texting, though there are quite a few ways to communicate like calls or facetime. have you asked them which one they perfer most? which one do you perfer most? i feel like recording audio messages can also be helpful. finding what works for both of you can really help enhance the quality of your talks

my parents answer 'ok' or 'üëç'to everything lmao just because they aren't that great at texting!"
mentalhealth,fgs9rn0,t3_f09lun,1581077777.0,i'm here for you
therapy,fgrtzos,t3_f06j3a,1581057518.0,"thank you so much for sharing! that already means a lot. going through that stuff as a child must've left such a huge imprint on you. i hear you.

i'm not sure how much it helps but here. i experience similar feelings due to sexual assault and the one and only thing that helped me was to talk to my partner and tell them how i feel and what i want. that i need patience and time. that i need someone who's kind and gentle with me. that it is purely because of my own experiences and not because of them. if your current girlfriend is any better than your last, i'm sure she will understand you and you will help each other grow and heal together.

opening up to people you feel **safe** with, is so beautiful and powerful. i wish you the best!"
mentalhealth,fgqbbvs,t3_ezyd8m,1581021179.0,"i feel like too many people are simply not heard, let alone listened to. sometimes all you need is just a person that is fully present with you. so many doctors don't really help you, rather just simply prescribe meds as the easiest remedy when it's not. it can causes even more problems. it eases the symptoms, what about the root cause?

what does help look like to **you**? what do you feel like you need? what is your soul craving for?"
mentalhealth,fgq5q65,t1_fgq58b1,1581018363.0,"that's great, thank you for mentioning it!"
mentalhealth,fgq0t3v,t3_ezws02,1581015709.0,carl jung's dream analysis is very insightful. shows how unconscious mind communicates with us. could help you as well! it does sound like some kind of hidden message trying to communicate its way to you through dreams
mentalhealth,fgpz9f5,t1_fgpxi5z,1581014858.0,"you're doing great man, thank you for expressing and sharing these experiences publicly! 

i understand that the girl was/is a big part of your emotional life and kind of a safe haven from all your worries. there's a lot of focus on her but so little on you though. this whole situation shows that you might be relying deeply on other people and when they feel it, they run away. it's a lot of emotional baggage to be put on and i completely understand the girl. she doesn't owe anyone anything. and neither do you. 

focusing on yourself for a little while, getting your school stuff straight, figuring out your own emotional desires & needs could be helpful

a living human being can't become your coping mechanism. it's a person with feelings and we can't control them for our own benefit"
mentalhealth,fgpwdi5,t3_ezw0zu,1581013281.0,"sounds like a form of codependency. 

what does the girl distract you from? is it really just school work or something deeper?"
mentalhealth,fgpnxxr,t3_ezv86g,1581008592.0,taking deep breaths or just simply being aware of your breath helps to return back to reality and stay present
mentalhealth,fgpmxn6,t3_ezv0b9,1581008032.0,"this is a safe space for you. 
how do you feel? maybe there is a feeling or a reason behind this? 
you're describing external circumstances, i'd love to know how you feel inside too"
mentalhealth,fgplqpe,t3_ezumud,1581007339.0,what sensations do you get while imagining these scenarios?
mentalhealth,fgpk0c8,t3_eztm59,1581006342.0,"i think it stays with us always. someone who had such an impact is important in your life thus is present in your mind. even when you 'forget', it still hides in the unconscious and can reappear any time. just gotta be okay with them hanging around in our brain i guess"
mentalhealth,fgphhfa,t3_ezu059,1581004887.0,"the love from our parents should come naturally. effortlessly. that's it. it's a birth right to be loved by our care givers. but reality isn't always like that. 

pleasing your parents because they were never emotionally there for you is so fucking draining. it's like nothing you do can motivate them to show and express the love and care that you want, that the child in you is always craving till this very day. 

i've gone through the same thing and then later experienced the same shit in romantic relationships. you don't **earn** anyone's love! it doesn't require constant pushing, sacrifice, heartbreak and so on. it's a choice to love someone. it's a choice that you make every day. and you deserve to be loved by someone like that man.

there's not much you can do about the parent part other than understand where they're coming from. we all are going through so many things and we can't really help someone if they don't want it. i just hope that you know that you deserve healthy love. kind love. the effortless love. 
take care <3"
mentalhealth,fgpeuxz,t1_fgpee4q,1581003395.0,"i believe in that too! intuition, gut feeling is real. even when it doesn't seem rational

mentalhealth,fgpdxmw,t3_eztu6l,1581002853.0,"hm this feeling of people pretending or acting. i get it too sometimes. it's almost like you can feel when they're not being genuine.

relationship_advice,fgpda30,t3_eztph9,1581002465.0,hmmm maybe you could subtly introduce him to healthy communication and active listening skills? tell him you saw a post or something that really resonated with you or watch a youtube video together
relationship_advice,fgpcdo6,t3_eztjzs,1581001918.0,"that is truly a big decision! it seems like her only purpose is to get married and you being a nice, caring person want to be there for her. 

it feels like she is a bit manipulative though, the phrases that she has other options who to marry etc. making you feel like you're in competition or something.

you can't force things to work out, when they aren't meant to. trust what your intuition is saying. if you're doubting and are worried so intensely, that means something isn't going right in this situation. 

you deserve someone who wants to be with you for you not for a fucking visa."
relationship_advice,fgpb4w9,t3_eztdko,1581001147.0,"if i was in your shoes, i'd leave. kindly explain to him how i feel and go on to find what actually makes me feel happy. not guilty! that's such a sad place to live in. it should be enjoyable girl and you deserve it! you honestly wrote the answer you're looking for just now"
mentalhealth,fgp9a8b,t3_ezsjr2,1580999952.0,"hm this feels a bit shady to me. those messages and the date, yet she says it's unhealthy for you to question her behavior? i'm here to say that it is perfectly healthy and natural. you have genuine concern which should be taken into account. 

next thing. why put on an act for someone? that's some very interesting behavior lmao especially when you're in another relationship. maybe she still has feelings for him but doesn't want to admit it? if someone was indeed your 'first love', then there's no need for acting. or faking feelings

the 'i don't care' , 'i'm going to hang out with ___ anyway' , 'you need to heal from ____' agh! 
a relationship consists of two people and both parties are involved. at the very least support each other through personal healing journies. reassure each other when it's needed. you voice your worries and needs to her but she projects it back onto you rather than actually emotionally being there for you. 

the promise ring situation i can understand but taking into account all the stuff that's going on right now. feels off."
mentalhealth,fgp3e8a,t1_fgp1iq7,1580995770.0,"i'm glad to hear you're enjoying your current location! and yes, you're probably right. 
moving often sounds like so much instability and stress especially for a child ): 
i believe this feeling of security is so important just for simple survival,  no matter if it's a child or a grown up. maybe rediscovering, rebuilding it now as an adult could make some kind of difference. you probably have developed so many skills to deal with change and stress, to adapt fast to all that's going on but ah you deserve to feel stable and secure too. to relax and trust. i really hope you experience that warm feeling again very soon <3"
mentalhealth,fgp0m4a,t3_ezqd49,1580993569.0,"what influenced you to move to another state? 

i'm not sure but maybe this can help. i went through similar feelings last year. 

moved to a beautiful island yet i'd wake up to this exact feeling that you describe. lost, surreal, lonely. i'd cry the moment i woke up, holding back the tears throughout the day and then crying again before sleep every night. it is such a lonely place to be in mentally.
i hear you. 

one day i couldn't take it anymore and booked a flight back to my home country. the day i got on that plane felt like such a fucking relief. i can't even begin to explain! i knew i had to go back. i remember that the feeling completely vanished when i spent the night at my parents house, sleeping in my own bed. i felt so much gratitude for it. such a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.

now looking back i understand that the drastic change i made was coming from somewhere else. i was running away from my own self and this surreal feeling showed how intense was all the shit i was trying to get away from. physically i was in a new place but mentally it was still the same old world. maybe that is what caused the surreal feeling. two worlds mixed together.  i wasn't ready to take in the new surroundings fully. i had to rest and figure out what is going on inside first.

being back at home i fell into a deep dark void for a few months. i sat with it, listened to it and figured out so many new interesting things about myself. the old me would've left the second it got a bit tough. now i'm still living in my home town. things are going great and i don't feel that deep urge to move anymore. I'm okay here the way it is here. never liked this city but am slowly falling in love with it which is really nice. i will be moving to another country to study this autumn. doing the whole process slowly and gradually and it honestly feels amazing. 

i understand not everyone has the opportunity to go back. maybe not even a place to go back. you said ""i feel like  i have to do something to make it go away"". i say do nothing. relax and let yourself rest a bit. maybe something will come up? stay with this feeling as you stay with your inner child. i feel like every feeling is there for us to listen to it and to be present with. the more we ignore it, the stronger, more severe or even physical it gets."

depression,fgmoxbf,t3_ez48d4,1580929053.0,"ahh after reading this, i want to give you a goodgood hug ): i feel you and understand you. 
you have a beautiful plan that is coming into fruition at its own time and that's beautiful. you probably heard this before. you honestly don't have to know anything or figure out anything at this point in your life. i don't feel like we ever truly have everything figured out. what you're doing right now is more than enough. you're showing up, you're doing s o m e  t h i n g  and that's what matters most. the fact that you're also doing it alone surrounded by, what it seems, unhealthy family dynamics and close to zero support is so so honorable. you're discovering things, you're experiencing and experimenting. 

the way you mentioned your friends right there at the title shows how much they mean to you, how much their words matter to you because they are your friends. calling someone 'cursed' feels like ah. almost alienation? it's as if you're 'cursed' because you're experiencing these tough situations which allow you to evolve, learn, mature, grow but they're immune to it.  in this situation, one should support and emotionally be present for a friend who's going through it. it seems nowhere to be found in this circumstance. 

i really really do believe that a change of environment can transform a person in so many positive ways. you have all these external stressors around you (family, friends, societal prejudice) and you're trying to cope with all of them at the same time which is honestly impossible. you're so strong for this but you deserve to feel weak too. to feel peace and content. to not deal with all of their shit and just focus on you for a little while. i really trust that your plan happens and with that, maybe a internal change too <3"
therapy,fgmmkgb,t3_ez6xaf,1580927649.0,it sounds like the girl took it kind of personal. maybe she doesn't want to see anyone else in that place other than her?
