depression,f1zzfha,t3_db0bhz,1569852820.0,"Most days I just wanna sleep forever. I wake up, I may feel hungry or grimy but I roll over and close my eyes because I'm exhausted. I do t want to think. About breathing. Coping. About hurting. It's the only way I know how to shut it all off. 

I'm just scared that I'm gonna be stuck with all my trauma, trapped with all of it if I never wake up. I have so many nightmares and severe insomnia and usually sleep highly medicated. 

Sometimes I go days without sleeping
Sometimes I sleep for almost two days straight. 

I just get treated like shit for either.


I'm starting to think it's not worth staying awake anymore."

depression,eyjnp3g,t3_cx1nlm,1567123422.0,"I'm scared to sleep and I can't help it when I cant get out of bed and just pass out. That I'm just gonna be screamed at and blames for feeling worthless and told that ""literally everyone"" struggles with depression and still manage to be productive. That I'm just lazy.

I keep on wishing it'll all stop because I know I'm never gonna be wanted and things are only gonna get better if I die."
depression,evrbvd7,t3_ckmvf8,1564705096.0,"It's one of the things that make it hardest for me to be forthright and get properly diagnosed. I get extremely paranoid that my psych thinks I'm an imposter.
It sucks.
And I feel like I also repeat myself a lot, too. Or cry too much."
