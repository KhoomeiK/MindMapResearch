In my infinite wisdom, I rebooted. Strangely, it wouldn't boot with a corrupt kernel. Fancy that!

So I booted from an Arch installation USB drive, mounted things, chrooted in and reinstalled the kernel, which didn't give me any errors this time!

Rebooted, same thing as before I reinstalled the kernel. Boot from the Arch installation media again, and realize I had previously mounted /boot *before* arch-chrooting into my root partition, so I'd just installed the kernel to a /boot folder on my root partition instead of in the EFI partition. Oops!

That time I mounted the EFI partition after chrooting and then installed the kernel, and everything was back to normal.

Turned out Steam had a bug that was causing it to spam an error log to /tmp so fast it would fill /tmp within seconds after deleting it, and the application instability I'd been experiencing was because /tmp was full. Updated Steam and fixed the problem."

I think there is a nugget of truth buried in there, but that truth is that being loved by someone won't automatically transform someone from a neurotic mess into a well-adjusted person, not that you have to already be well-adjusted to develop a loving relationship with another person.

I also believe, quite strongly, that lack of self-love can be caused and/or fueled by lack of love from others. It's hard to love yourself when the world is essentially telling you you're unlovable. Being loved by someone else can be the catalyst for developing self-love; you have to recognize it and do the work to accept their love enough to start trying to see in yourself what they do, which can be very difficult, but it's still a hell of a lot easier than developing self-love in a vacuum.

And yet you're defending a practice that runs contrary to that goal. Owning private property people need to survive and charging rent for people to live there promotes misery and unhappiness, and if they can't pay and end up on the streets there goes their health, too.

> besides the argument that possession per se shouldn't exist which is bullshit because you wouldn't let me use your stuff for free either

Really? You never let people borrow your stuff, or give stuff away to people? 
Did your parents never teach you to share? 

> But sure be happy in your anarchocapitalist thought prison were lifes and the suffering of people doesn't matter and where to strong and abled should come out as winners

You're the one defending private property and the practice of exploiting it to parasitize people who are less fortunate. I empathize with suffering, I just don't believe suffering justifies exploitation."
