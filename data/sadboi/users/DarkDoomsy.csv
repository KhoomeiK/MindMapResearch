relationship_advice,exu1cxc,t1_exu0xb2,1566578012.0,I don't have enough control over conversations to voice all of this. And she doesn't listen when she's on a rant. I think a letter would be best.

relationship_advice,extxxmn,t1_extxg8o,1566576558.0,"It took me a while to ask that question during a discussion because she kept being very negative about it but once I finally got her to listen to my question she said she absolutely is hoping for someone who would last for the long haul but she is just doubtful of it because of the statistics (and again kept harping on that). So I know she WANTS the long term thing but she's just so negative about everything. I ask for a little optimism and she just says it's best to just be objective. 

So she does want a good long term relationship she just doesn't voice it"
