I am still a ""closeted"" atheist as my love for family still wins everytime. I pretend to be Christian to make them happy, especially my mom, who has sacrificed so much to me and my sister. 

Coming from a very religious household, we practically have the same story. What made me think about my faith was how my religion would attack homosexuals, people of other beliefs and race, and people like me who have depression. For my parents, if you have depression, you don't have faith. 

Like you said, this subreddit has been a lifeline. To make me realise that I am not crazy and that it is ok to question things. I have been reading a lot here as well and tend to research the things I have learned. 

But kudos to you, and I hope to make the same decision one day."

That person is suffering, may it be from severe depression or physical disease. They have been fighting for so long that it causes them further deterioration. Thus I have always supported euthanasia and do not judge people who commit suicide. As a person who has been struggling with bouts of moderate to severe depression, panic attacks and that 1 day of hallucinations, I hope other people would be more open and understanding. Yes I am still here, still fighting the war with my brain, but in all honesty, sometimes I do not know until when I can do it."

She would chop 2 eggplants into ""pork like slices"", cook it in soysauce, vinegar and sugar and mix it with lots and lots of rice. She was able to feed the 4 of us with that. Rice is the best when you don't have money."

This will give them time to wrap things up  Season 4 was great, so I'm sure the last season will go out in a bang. The announcement definitely made me decide to go see Tom Ellis in July for comic con."
