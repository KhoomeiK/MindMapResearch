CoronavirusUK,foo0jag,t3_g8kbhg,1587930117.0,"I'm in America and the remote learning from my children's school is an absolute joke. The site they use has constant issues with the logins which require a frustratingly difficult reset process. The lessons themselves are, well, they can barely even be called lessons. It's a 2 sentence or 30 second video instruction for a worksheet that has no more than five questions. This is the standard assignment set up for each subject for my 3rd grader. There is no interaction with the teachers, there is no in depth look at what they're learning. It takes about 3 hours to complete the worksheets for every subject and that's with me trying to show different examples and connect to other lessons. My other daughter is in kindergarten and her assignments haven't even been updated for the last week.

I'm looking into what other options I have because this is unacceptable. The girls are suffering from a lack of social interaction as well as a lack of progression in their education.

I've heard similar things from friends and relatives with kids in other districts using different systems. It doesn't look good for most of us here.

How does it work there? I'm curious as to how much interaction you get with your teachers?"

I've seen some comments that could only have been written by a psychopath on posts that weren't about anything that should incite such strong emotions.

My bf and I have been talking about this since the beginning,. Things aren't too bad here, yet, but we've definitely noticed a shift in the general atmosphere of the city.
