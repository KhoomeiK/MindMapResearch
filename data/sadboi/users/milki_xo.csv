BPD,fool3i1,t3_g8jvs5,1587941126.0,The joys of quarrentine where we all think  super deep and on an emotional level. We as a community thankyou for having these thoughts it makes me feel so supported and its super misunderstood. A person with BPD is not the same as the next person. I had a person I was seeing that completely stigmatized the heck out of me because his ex had BPD and DID along with anxiety and depression and practically put his experiences from her onto me. It really wasn't fair I did alot of therapy to get to the happy and peaceful point that I have today and now I have found someone who is my person the person that would be there for me and that person that will support me no matter what. So I thankyou for pulling these thoughts out. I just wish this was expressed outside of this forum because you were super on point
BPD,fmesdkl,t3_fusezc,1586012434.0,"I feel you on this level, right now I have cracked and broke down crying twice now since self isolation. I have never felt so alone in my life and people think I'm okau when really I am not.  I am with my partner and his kids and holy shit,  triggers all over the place. I legit can't stop crying. 

However at the moment lots of reality tv,  drawing,  and YouTube that's it and workouts and meditation that's it"
BPD,fhx4gkz,t1_fhx24ij,1581944240.0,"Tbh I am fine, I am being mindful of everything that is going on, I stopped spiralling years ago and got myself to a place where I feel at peace. However my sister on the other hand I try and try even try talking to her but its like a brick wall but I will take on what you said about things that I wish people told me when I was going through that stage. She keeps redoing her resumes, I know she is itching to go back to work I have even helped her with it all but with her attitude right now I don't think it would be good for her. However my mum was trying to get her to take her medication then my sister started to refuse and would cry and have a fit about it, so we stopped trying to force it down her throat because we are scared she will hit us. I have noticed she is bruised in the face and I think she is punching herself while no one is watching her. She has ran away many times to train stations to kill herself and I am so paranoid that one day I will come to her dead its so stressful I feel like I am running out of options you know."

BPD,ezi96if,t3_d179n0,1567923248.0,Well I feel that way too sometimes but at the end of the day I am glad I'm not spiralling down so often because  it's tiring don't get me wrong I'm always tired but honey it's better this way and it gives you so much opportunity to do things now start gym or something socially interactive because real friends will stick by you even at your worst.
BPD,ezgnoy0,t1_ezerl3h,1567899102.0,"If you ever feel like you're gonna do something just say you will regret it later, because majority of us feel so guilty afterwards"

BPD,ezcb3e9,t3_d0lbdz,1567832480.0,"I feel on the fence however I do hate how I'm terrified of not knowing the mood I have to wake up to in the morning. I also hate how I'm so self sabotaging of myself, I'm always so angry and tired all the time. However I do have my good days and I thrive and feel so normal, but at the same time I get to the end of the day and I just get rather lonely because I have no one to come home too. Then again when it comes to relationships I either sabotage them myself or I just make every excuse to not do certain things and I get triggered and I just get angry. Tbh I am tired of being angry all the time"
BPD,ez96ow5,t3_d0en53,1567774567.0,"Aww no this is so upsetting I'm so sorry she lashed out on you like that don't blame your self it was not your fault she just over reacted and I know how hard it is, I live with BPD and I am so sorry you had to go through that, it's not easy hearing that a parent wants to commit just make sure you take care of yourself and not take it to heart"

lonely,ez4dehs,t3_czvwmn,1567685090.0,"All I can say is that you've not only lost motivation but you have also lost your self love and confidence. You need to find that within yourself, at the end of the day if you really want to make the change you will start making small changes by looking yourself in the mirror and start saying I am worthy of a beautiful woman in my life."
