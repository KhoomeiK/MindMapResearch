19 and 18 year old got stabbed while at a college block party. (A person literally walked through tons of people just cutting and stabbing). The 19 year old was stabbed in his lower and mid back just missing the kidney and lung.

The 18 year old was stabbed in the heart, and his chest was ripped open as they massaged his heart and found the bleed. There was too much damage, they're was too much blood loss. He was announced dead after 4 mins of being on the trauma bed.


Had to pick up a 5yr old because her older 13yr old brother and his friend took pictures of themselves ""doing things too her"" and mom found the pictures the same day. She left to get a cake to celebrate the two boys birthdays that day. (The 5 yr old had to wait for 4 hours to have a rape kit done on her.)



Picked up a 21 year old girl who was abducted from her driveway (she was moving in with her bf and she was unpacking the car alone). This man dragged her to his house (1 block away) raped her to pieces (3 times) 3rd time he threw her in the shower, took her clothes and car keys and hid the car. She jumped out a 2nd story window, and ran 3 blocks up to a restuarant on a strip and asked for help. Turns out the guy was having a mental episode of sorts and had actually robbed a store up around the corner from that location. To make it worse. They caught him and they asked up to bring the girl back around to identify him.

It was him.

Those are the 3 calls that haunt me."

My physiatrist wants me to take double at night now so I'm semi freaking out. I told him that I had serious issues being alone at night and falling asleep because I'm paranoid. I feel like I'm being watched and I sit in bed waiting for sleep to find me or the monsters I imagine slithering out to get me. It sounds crazy, I know it wont happen but the second light is gone...I'm out of my mind.
So now, waking up every few hours is worrisome because if I get too stimulated from waking up, I can't go back to sleep because my spiralling thoughts start up and my meds don't (gabapentin) doesnt kick in fast enough for that.

But I guess I'll ride this train for 3 months like you suggested and go from there. The most annoying part of this too by the way.. I only get manic like every 3-4 months for a few days at a time.

I.e. therapy. Set a goal that he needs to go for at least 6 months until he cam stop. If he doesnt like it then try a new method.

2. My therapist said that meditation actually helps because it slows and quiets the activity in that part of the brain to give it time to rest.
