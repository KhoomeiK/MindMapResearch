That being said, I knew the behavior wasn't 'right' but you become numb to the things they do and say in order to protect yourself. Also, trauma bonding is a very real thing.

They were not bad people (not all of them, at least), just very lost. My mother divorced when I was young and remarried when I was getting into the thick of it. The guy she married (awesome dude) was a 5 time iron man and ended up building a spin studio/cycle shop with my mom. Slowly my interest in drugs and partying dwindled as I became physically healthier. It allowed me the chance to change my mental health and body image as well. From there, at 17 I asked for a gym membership. At this point I was no longer doing hard drugs and was slowly removing myself from the scene. I started lifting and it made me feel strong and independent. Drugs made me feel dependent and weak. When I was 18 my then-boyfriend over dosed on heroin in my bathroom. I found him when I woke up for work one morning. Thankfully he didn't die. But from that moment forward I completely nixed that group, changed my way of thinking, moved states, and started power lifting. It's good to feel in control of your life."

You being emotionally distant is *never an excuse* to speak to or form an emotional relationship with anyone else. (Unless you have an open or poly relationship, of course). Yes, you may have pushed him out and been guarded. That is **not** your fault. Many people are unaware to the ways that emotional trauma can alienate them from themselves. This means that many people don't know what they're doing while they're doing it, like you. Does this mean its 'ok'? No, but you recognize it now, and that's what matters. On the other hand, your husband knew exactly what he was doing. Yes, he's been there, but he's been speaking to somebody else. Did he try to give you ultimatums to try and help you and your relationship? Did he ever try to talk to you about the way your actions were hurting him?

Really, what this comes down to is communication- on *both* ends. He can not singularly put this on you. It takes two to tango, remember? Look at it like this: It should never be two against each other, but two against the problem.

My first suggestion is personal counseling for yourself, and couples counseling for the two of you. If he objects to couples counseling, then I fear it will probably not work out as this means he is unwilling to learn tools to help you and the relationship."

When bleaching again, do not touch your roots. Focus on the length down to the tips and leave for 20 minutes. Add bleach to the roots for the last 10. 

If your hair is already damaged, look up 'hair bleach bath' and use that route instead, it will make sure that it stays in good shape and doesn't become 'hay like'. 

Once your hair is light blonde, buy a wella T18 (lightest ash blonde), leave it for 20 minutes, and rinse. It will turn purple, but once you rinse it out, your hair will be platinum.

He may not recognize that he doesn't have to mention things like 'not telling his dad you're bi' because maybe he's dated women in the past who weren't as self aware/polite?

As far as not wanting to do things with you, that's on him- not  on you. If he doesn't want to do something, that should be fine. It's when he's keeping you from doing the things you enjoy doing that it becomes abusive behavior. Again, I would dwindle this down to a lack of compatibility.

While the advice given may seem to be coming from a 'different place', know  this: a relationship is a relationship and abuse is abuse. No matter what your sexual orientation or gender is, respect and communication and boundaries are all expected within a healthy relationship. Just because you are  gay, does not  mean  your moody girlfriend has the right  to treat you like shit because she's upset. I get it, as women, we're more emotional. But have you done any of those things to her? You're emotional too right? And you get upset, but you still don't lash out at her or belittle her, do you? If you don't do it and try to actively and constructively solve problems, then why would  you justify her behavior? *This is emotional abuse, there is nothing you can do to change that.* 

I have had two serious relationships with women. Both of them, unfortunately, ended up very emotionally and verbally abusive. I consistently ignored the red flags, thinking it was just a 'one time thing', or that they were just having a bad day. Turns out, they weren't just having a bad day. 

My most recent ex, whom I am still in the process of tucking tail and running from, did some of these things. Let's call her D. 

When I met D, she was everything. She was beautiful, funny, carefree, fit, healthy, had motive and drive and goals. She was my ideal woman. She was nothing like the girl I had been with before, so I thought that I was in the clear. She was loving, doted upon me, gave me gifts... all of it. We had problems in the first few months, but once I showed her I was serious about leaving, she seemed to stop completely. Everything was 'perfect'. We were long distance for a year. I moved cities and left my job to be with her. I have anxiety, disordered eating, and depression and it gets worse under stress, like most things. 

The first time she had a 'mood swing', she was drunk, so I justified it. She had been previously diagnosed with a personality disorder, but never went into detail about it. (She's in the military, so I'm unsure if she  is getting the help she actually needs). She also has intermittent explosive disorder, ADHD, and OCD. I began to justify her actions based on the premise that she 'has a disorder and is doing the best she can'. But she still shamed me. She shamed me for my past (when I used to party as a teenager); when ever I forgot my wallet she would get angry and say condescending things to me and drilled the word 'accountability' into my head. I learned to never forget my wallet. During a really extreme episode where she lashed out at me and threatened to kill herself, after calming her down, I withdrew intimately. I was still caring and would kiss her and cuddle, but I just didn't want to be touched. In response, she made me feel bad for not being 'intimate enough' and would call me a 'prude'. She would make jokes saying the 'internet was the most action she got'- even after I asked her to stop. She then decided (even though I spent every waking moment with her), that I was cheating on her. She blamed me for  making her feel 'worthless and ugly and unloved', even though I was trying so hard to show her I loved her- I tried so fucking hard. She got mad that I 'couldn't be the one to help her'; *you cannot be your partners therapist.* 

And then, the first time I left her, she told me she didn't miss me. She didn't need me. And that while it would hurt, she would move  on and just 'get another girlfriend'. I went back to her. Because love is enough, right?

Here's what I've learned: ***Love is not enough.*** Disorder or not, ***nobody has the right to treat you like shit because they're upset***. Would you do that to her? ***Nobody has the right to blame you for their feelings.*** ""You made me..."" is a sentence to be weary of, because unless you're physically making somebody do something, you can't ""*make someone*"" feel any type of way. Their emotions are their problem- ***NOT*** yours. I understand, with all of my heart, believing that it will get better and that they will grow, but unless they face the consequences for their actions, they usually won't. And *some times that consequence is you leaving.* Do not allow yourself to change your boundaries in order to shape her needs. This allows for co-dependency. 

For a while, I was really depressed. I still kind of am. I'm packing my exes things right now, and moving. I have to cut contact. It ***is not bad to be selfish when it comes to protecting yourself.*** This means physically AND mentally. This ***world is too fucking big to settle*** for someone who treats you like shit. I know there are beautiful women out there who will love me and treat me right and not threaten to kill themselves to win a fight. I know I will be loved again, but right now, I need to love myself and I hope you can do the same."

I understand that you're young. And unfortunately, putting ourselves in those kinds of situations is the best way to learn from them. Knowing a person for a month is definitely not enough time to be able to assume your compatibility with them, especially when it comes to something as serious as moving in together. Believe me, I understand how you feel. I moved from Oregon to Washington to be with a woman whom I fell madly in love with- we were together long distance (seeing each other every weekend) for a year before we moved in together. It's been four months and I'm breaking up with her. So- you're learning a month isn't long enough, and I'm learning a YEAR isn't long enough.

If you want to try and make it work, remember the 3 C's: compromise, compassion, and connection. You're both going to have to work WITH each other, not against each other. 

The only reason why this didn't work in my situation is because my girlfriend became emotionally abusive- if that is the case with you, she can find a room mate. Such is life."

We are taking a break right now and trying to figure things out; I asked her to move out. I required her to go to weekly counseling in order for me to 'try again' too. 

&#x200B;

There were signs for me in the beginning too. The belittling, the name calling, the anger. I asked her to stop, and originally broke it off a few months in, but then she begged for me back. Told me that she loved me and that she would change. And she did. For a whole year. And then three months after I got us an apartment up here, she snapped. Blamed it on stress, but that doesn't justify her actions. So we started going to couples counseling to try and work it out, and I asked her to move out. Last Saturday I tried to break up with her; she swayed me into a break. I love her, through it all, all of the hurt. What can I say. We agreed to only talk once a week and not see each other at all until November. Who knows if it will change anything. What I do know though, is that she's genuinely trying. She knows how she acted was wrong, now I guess it's just seeing if she can apply what she's learning..."

It sucks because I finally got all of the courage and broke up with her at the end of one of our couples counseling appointments. At first she was furious, but then she started hugging me and telling me to 'think about all the good we have' and I'm 'just confused', and was able to make the 'break up' into 'a break'. I'm supposed to talk to her for the first time over the phone this week and I'm anxious about it. She's given me my space, but it's making it harder for me to stay strong because I miss her. Even though she's abusive."

Assumes I'm cheating or have fallen in love with somebody else even though I go home to her every night and spend all of my free time with her... I felt like you just surmised everything that's been happening to me. And I told her I wanted to break up, that I couldn't be the person that she needed in her life right now.. 

&#x200B;

It's such an awful feeling, having to put yourself first when it's somebody you love and care about so much. I don't think she knew what she was doing either, I don't think she understood how much the things she said or did impacted me, but after a certain point, everything she did hurt. Even the good things, because all I could remember was the bad. It's crazy how someone so amazing can turn around and tell you that you make them want to kill themselves. 

As shitty as it is, It's nice not to feel alone in this. You did the right thing. You're being strong and doing what you need to do for you."
