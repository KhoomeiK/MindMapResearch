Since you will be home for the summer do you think you could find a summer job to help you stay out of the house?  Please be safe and if you plan to suck it up as you stated please, seek out a therapist to help you navigate through the next two years.

I am so sorry that you are unable to come out of the closet.  I have a child that is M2F and started transitioning back in December.  She just turned 14.  I am thankful she trusted me enough to tell me a year ago that she felt this way.  3 years ago she originally told me she was gay.  I have no idea what I am doing as a mother but I do my best to support her and educate her.  I'm in financial debt caused by medical bills but I will continue to find a way to pay them as her and her health are important.  I have done my best to find the right team of doctors and mental health experts to help her find her way.  If you ever need words of encouragement please feel free to PM me."
DysfunctionalFamily,fr5l0u1,t3_gmt1ha,1589910295.0,"Are you truly able to cut ties with your family and maintain supporting yourself through college?  You are 20 now and if you work or can work I would start looking at how you can put money back.  Weigh out if you can continue with schooling if your parents threaten to cut you off.  Start making a plan, talk to friends who have already left home and see what they needed to get started.

Finally as someone living in a dysfunctional family myself, I suggest talking to a therapist.  If your brother is assaulting you and getting physical with you that is not Okay.  Pressing charges is hard to do against a family member but sometimes it's neccessary for your own state of mind and protection.  

I wish you luck and hope you can start creating a plan to move out permanently and move on with your life."

AmItheAsshole,fr0shge,t1_fqzzpds,1589805613.0,Thank you for saying this part.  It's such a misconception that child support only pays for clothes or items the child needs.  Its actually to supplement the child's overall well being.  That is why most states also require the non custodial parent to contribute to medical expenses.
AmItheAsshole,fr0s9zs,t3_glu4ru,1589805464.0,"NTA - I am going through a similar situation.  My ex has convinced everyone I am crazy and that he shouldn't have to pay anything as I chose to leave him.  My ex never attended any of the hearings to present documents for his income and once they located him he was not working so I got the state minimum of $43 per week.  He's had several high paying jobs and I've never requested a review.  His total arrears are almost 5 years worth out of the 7 years since I filed. 
  
It's so utterly frustrating.  Its currently been 6 months since he made a 100 payment that kept him from spending a weekend in jail.  Corona has held everything up and even started the process of contempt over.  I don't even bother to contact the courts anymore.  I don't have time for it.  I have been paying for every cent associated with the care of my child and the medical part alone is in the thousands every year.  

Child support is for the well being of the child.  It is to keep a roof over the childs head, provide them with food and ensure vital utilities stay on.  Too many people believe Child support is supposed to only buy items directly associated with the child and once the child can cover those costs themselves they shouldn't still receive child support.  When Mom or Dad does cover the cost of everything then the child support is to reimburse the parent on the receiving end.  Its 1 of the most frustrating misconceptions I hear about child support."

I apologized and told him that unfortunately his package was in the package car in which our driver had a serious accident and we would not be able to deliver his package today.  1st he asked if he could go to where the scene of the accident was which I replied No. He then proceeded to berate me and declare he was guaranteed his delivery.  I apologized and stated we would review the packages and make an attempt the next day which was not good enough.  He kept insisting I personally drive out to where his package was at and pick it up.  This man kept me on the phone for 20 minutes before I was able to hang up on him do to multiple warnings about the man cursing me out.  He still managed to get a Corporate Concern in that same evening.  The driver ended up being ok even though he was thrown from the truck. The package car looked like it had been hit by a cement truck.  Luckily most of the impact happened on the passenger side which probably saved our drivers life.  It was such a scary day.

You made it personal and because your daughter looks up to you I am sure she could never imagine that you would have been bullied.  Being open and honest about your own struggles can help most children understand their own feelings.  

I have a very insecure child who looks like my twin and middle school is just as hard on them as it was on me.  I found this God awful pic of me from middle school one day while my child was feeling insecure. I held the pic behind my back and asked my child if they think I'm pretty.  They answered yes.  I them asked does everyone say you look just like me and do you think you look like me?  Again the answer was yes.  I then pulled out my 7th grade picture and presented it to my child.  They laughed and asked who it was because they look just alike.  I said it was me and I had written a note on the back.  I wrote, I finally found myself and you will too one day.  My picture showed  some half done hair in a cool Saved by the bell type outfit and an insecure little girl that wanted to be so pretty that day.  My child keeps it next to the bed now and it's probably one of the things that helped them to see I do understand what they're going through.

AmItheAsshole,fnywkjo,t3_g4e7ez,1587378363.0,"YTA - And this is why my oldest Stepson now lives with his father and I.  He litterally had a mental breakdown only 2 months into his sophomore year because Mom was making sure to pick classes that would set him up for college.  He's always been a B-C student and somehow she pushed him to take all advanced classes, she managed to get him approved for classes in which he didn't even meet the prerequisites, grounded him for having less than a 3.0 GPA and couldn't understand why he wasn't cutting it and struggling with depression.  I noticed he was depressed a few months into his Freshman year because he would only wake up to Skype his girlfriend or sleep the rest of the day.  It took the mental breakdown for both Mom and Dad to realize how far he had really fallen which included 2 suicide attempts in which we never knew about until the big breakdown.  He ended up spending 4 days in the hospital after that and immediately moved in with us upon discharge.  (We do CoParent pretty well as we've all known each other for 20+ years)

My kid comes off as on overly happy personality with aspirations to do the right thing.  He's a great kid with a big heart and he felt he was letting his family down by not getting the A's and B's needed for his classes.  He was so focused on getting a good grade for his mom that he stopped socializing and became like a hermit.  This still didn't help him achieve the grades that were required.  Once he moved into our home we immediately set him up for counseling services both on school campus and off campus.  We worked with him and the school to determine which classes he should actually be taking.  We initially placed him on an IEP in the event his depression and or anxiety spiked again but just this month we were already able to remove the IEP as counseling along with the change of schools has made him much more happy.  He is now that A-B student while completing the correct courses that align with his needs and strengths.

OP, don't put undue stress on your teenager who probably already hates being at school by requiring they take harder classes.  Talk through why your child has chosen the classes they did.  If the response is ""They're easy so I chose them.""  Then back the fuck off.  There is a reason the kids are given the choice to choose the classes and parents just review them.  Go on, review and talk then over with your teen!"

I'm going to go against the grain because litterally 1 to 2 months ago a similar post would have told OP she is NTA because it's not her responsibility to take care of a child she did not help create, suggested alternatives to her sister and generally did not approve of the sister having a child.  OP might be TA for saying that her cats are more family than her niece but that is because OP has planned her life and finances around her and her cats.  

A recent trend on this sub since the pandemic started shutting whole countries down is for a post to be voted YTA for not taking care of irresponsible family members.   Anyone who chooses to bring a child into this world needs to realize that they come with responsibilities and financial costs.

Over the 12 years I have gone through several years of no pay increase or minimal pay increases and insurance costs continue to rise.  We are also responsible for our own retirement using 401K and buying stocks. Insurance payments pretty much total about the same % of your pay as your union dues.  I am working my way up through the company but when I left in 2011 it was due to the inability to move up.  UPS wasn't growing at the time and positions did not come open very often and I was in an extended center at the time.  If you're finishing college and have a desire to have a career at UPS now is the time.  All the new Hubs opening up along with hubs being updated to automation has opened several new positions.  I've invested a lot of time into UPS.  At this point if I would have stayed Union and not left the company, I would have quiet a bit invested into my retirement. 

 I came back to UPS because of the Health benefits.  There is also a sense of family in the hubs and centers and when something  happens to someone everyone comes together in my hub to help them.  I hope to move into a full time position in the near future. Good luck on whichever you choose."

AskADoctor,fmjbdjo,t3_fvj1cw,1586126857.0,"NAD: If you're still having a lot of pain then you should look at seeing a doc.  Speaking from experience, once again NAD, and breaking many bones and sprained/strained many ligaments and muscles, sprains and strains hurt worse and seem to take longer to heal.  Every bone I have broken except my cracked rib only hurt at the moment it broke and if I attempted to use or move said area.  Outside of that I typically do not feel pain from the break.  Every sprain and strain I have had has taken much longer to heal and even when at rest would ache or throb constantly.  Even though we down play a sprain or strain compared to a broken bone they can be a lot more bothersome and take longer than 4-6 weeks to heal especially if not treated correctly."

AmItheAsshole,flrhmjr,t1_flqqky1,1585420382.0,"Agreed!! My Business economics teacher told my class on its 1st day to never feel guilty for our own successes.  He went on to explain that when one starts doing well in life, people especially family, tend to expect that you should share what you have.  They will expect you to contribute more because you have more.  That's always stuck with me.  Just because OP manages her money correctly and has gone on to make a life for herself while brother has not doesnt mean that she is required to provide any type of financial support.  I had to learn this as I was becoming an adult. My mother tries to ask a lot of me because she feels I'm doing better than her are and so I should contribute more to her needs.  It's very frustrating."
UPS,flmwnlx,t1_fllit7w,1585299814.0,"I feel that so many people at a center level such as drivers and preloaders understand what services we're truly providing to the public.   Our Hub sorts seem to not understand this concept. 

I have 12 years with UPS and in those years I really came to understand how important our job is versus when I worked in the Hub. When we are delivering to our state CDC coolers full of lab test and lab results, delivering trailers full of diapers and toilet paper to Our Community Action Council everyday we are helping the needy with receiving essential items they need to survive, it makes me see what services we are really providing to the public.  I make decent money, I'm not rich by any means but UPS has allowed me to finally find andswers to my health problems.  

I've watched the center dispatch extra drivers and minimize stop counts so drivers could make it to the funeral of a fellow coworker that has passed.  I've watched everyone refurbish and clothe a fellow employee's family of 5 after a fire destroyed their home.  

UPS isn't perfect but there isn't very many companies that show the compassion that this place and most of it's employees do when things are getting tough.  Layoffs are coming, UPS won't be untouched by this.  Some of us will be lucky enough to continue working while others will be waiting at home to hopefully get called in."

TN was 10 days behind KY when they declared a State of emergency and TN continued to wait several days after each CDC recommendation to act.  You can read a news article showing the difference that the quick responses by KY has made versus Tennessee and how acting quickly has slowed the rate of infection significantly for KY.  Andy Beshear had quoted someone who said the biggest fear was that we would overreact and nothing would happen. He went on to say that was the goal.

UPS,flkeqxe,t1_flka3zk,1585239540.0,"Getting Teamsters to demand a pay increase would go against the Teamsters and UPS contract.  Teamsters would honestly think about the future implications to contract negotiations.  If a pay increase was demanded now, outside the contract terms, what is to keep UPS in the future from reducing pay because US sale are down?  I'm not saying it is comparing apples to apples but it opens the door for future contracts to be altered or amended even if temporary.  UPS on the other hand can offer a type of compensation seperate from the wages such as the new hire compensation that the company has used to increase employment.  The $75-100 extra per week for just being on time and there everyday has been given and taken away at the company's will in the past few years.  

The national contract can be located online.  On page 85, Article 27 is a small section which states both UPS and Teamsters can request a review of the contract within 60 days of war, declaration of an emergency, imposition of mandatory economic controls or any federal agency with a significant adverse effect on the financial structure of the Employer.  Basically still comes down to being forced to close, forced to alter benefits and money in order to get an amended contract.  Both are in this game to make money."

AdviceAnimals,fljx3gw,t1_fljo22y,1585228909.0,"I agree.  I had a former classmate that posted a picture of her email showing all the items she purchased online to ""stimulate the economy"" as she had put it.  

I informed her that a lot of employees realize that they are of good health and know the risks we're taking by continuing to work through this pandemic. It doesn't make us less scared or uniformed, just trying to do the job we are asked to do.  Ordering out of necessity is one thing, ordering because they have nothing better to do only adds to the risk of our employees.

The economy is going to take a hit one way or another through this.  Ordering yourself a new bed, tv or dresser is only causing delays as employees continue to self quarantine or continue getting sick.  

My hub is in Kentucky, who has been praised for Andy Bashear's ability to manage this pandemic yet only in the last 24 hours has cleaning started in the hub.

I stop calling, massaging and visiting and I  am quick to think others don't care without acknowledging my role in the relationship.

The fact that you say you have a plan screams that you need to get assistance with your mental health now.  The sad reality of depression is we sit around waiting for the world to make us happy or feel better about ourselves but it's all in vain if or when they do because we won't allow ourselves to think that way.  Depression is a monster that consumes us because we have to retrain our thinking patterns.  

I swear by therapy. I've watched my kids gain so much more through therapy than any other medication they were ever given.  We need someone that we can express our thoughts to who in return can help us understand why we think the way we do.  I myself know that I should be speaking with a therapist and I set my goal this year to focus on my mental health but my physical health took precedence instead.
