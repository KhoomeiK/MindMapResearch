Emotions cannot be affected by rational thought unless you have the skills to redirect your irrational (very real) fears into rational and calm behavior. When your hands are shaking and you're sweating with a heart running a million miles an hour, losing control of the feelings in your body, feeling like your knees are giving out (and then they do), and your chest feels like it's about to collapse (you can't breathe) and your vision starts to blur; its isolating, depressing, and frustrating. This is why people who have anxiety SHOULD go to CBT (such as myself 33F) but mental health issues are still stigmatized and not everyone has access to the health care they need."
