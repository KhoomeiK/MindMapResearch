ADHD,fbutzy0,t1_fbutldg,1577120335.0,I agree. Hearing you say that meds will help you focus on tasks at hand seems so surreal for me because I can't imagine being able to focus on stuff like that. What a concept! XD

neuro,fbfr6w2,t3_eane4a,1576818277.0,"Stress also loads a lot onto the brain. The brain shuts down ""unnecessary systems"" in effort to not burn out when focusing on pumping blood to the lungs and other fight or flight systems. It's actually really interesting what physiological processes are different in the brain during stress!"

neuro,fafxweg,t3_e8k2er,1576034682.0,"Long story short, yes. Stress has a massive impact on learning, especially those who experience chronic stress. 
Here's some research I found this semester in my biopsychology class!

When you are under a lot of stress, there are many things that happen during this time. Your body has instincts that are similar to survival. Your stress hormones cause your heart to race in order to pump blood throughout the body so muscles can respond instantly. Nonessential systems are turned off, our blood vessels shrink, and our lungs work extra hard to pump heaps of oxygen out and into the bloodstream.

Chronic stress has harsh effects on our brain. One specific example of how we are physiologically affected by stress is how it shrinks and sometimes kills our brain cells. In the hippocampus, stress changes the brain circuits and we lose some of our learning and memory abilities. 

Our body responds to famine the same way as other stressors. Stress can damage a baby in fetal life, causing them to have chronic lifelong stress. Babies who are conceived in stressed mothers have altered brain chemistry. This changes how neurons respond to stress and makes them more sensitive to stress, causing them to be in poorer health.

Stomach ulcers are a structure that has been researched for a long period of time; these pests were once thought to be unrelated to stress until later findings, when we found that it is related to stress, not through the bacteria, but the weakened immune system.  When your “non-essential” systems shut down, the immune system shuts down with that group. When this happens, you are unable to control the bacteria in your stomach, because stress has disrupted the body’s ability to heal itself. The bacteria then gets out of control, which causes stomach ulcers to form.

As we age, our telomeres shorten. This genetic structure is a protective end cap of chromosomes that helps keep the chromosome from fraying. Telomeres shorten as we age overtime; however, this process is sped up in people under chronic stress. The shortening of the telomeres is accelerated and the chromosomes they are protecting decreases the performance of those cells, ultimately causing them to function improperly.

Here's a 1 hour documentary on stress

Here's what you'll need:

* Polar bear (40 flowers for trade)
* Mini table (20 flowers for trade)
* Floral fence (15 flowers for trade) **x 2**

* Floral chair (35 flowers for 3 chairs) **x 3**
