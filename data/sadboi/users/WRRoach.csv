bipolar,fd2dei3,t3_ejoijn,1578145605.0,"You guys, these comments have been so helpful. I’m a licensed counselor and I also have Bipolar 1. It’s funny because the DSM-5 only talks about hallucinations and delusion pertaining to grandiosity thinking. Thinking you are a god, have super powers etc. I always assumed that the delusions I was having were related to past trauma (I’m sure some were). Reading all of this helps me know what others experience their delusions as- I never realized the paranoia was part of Bipolar. I just kind of thought I was going crazy. I used to think demons were after me all the time (I grew up in a super religious home). I could feel them there. It didn’t help that my church believed in that. Who knows maybe they are real. I remember one time (pre diagnosis) that I was at a friends house standing on a chair screening at the top of my lungs “Fuck you. I’m Batman!” And laughing hysterically. My most recent delusion in the past few months is the following:  

The world is what we see around us. But what if that’s all it is? What if we create everything with our mind through perceptions we let ourselves believed. Then I thought, if that’s true I can change were I am and what’s in my environment by thinking about it enough. I was laying in bed and tried to conjure up a carrot. It didn’t work. 

Sorry bout the long comment. This was just a really helpful thread so I wanted to share my thanks."

bipolar,fb7mxsc,t1_fb7k60r,1576594497.0,I’m not sure 100% but I think what made it skyrocket was that my brother is having major issues and has been in dangerous situations. I got super desperate to help him and hit a breaking point. Then I started having “great ideas” of ways I could solve the issue. Took me a while to realize they were manic unrealistic ideas.

And I’m currently trying to figure out how the hell I sent so much money to random thugs on my bro’s behalf and how I’m gonna have enough money until my pay check. This is maybe the most manic thing I’ve done. I spent like 2000 dollars in the last ten days trying to save my brothers ass. He’s in trouble locked up in prison getting beaten up and whatnot. My brilliant manic mind thought “I can solve the problem and save him from injury. I’ll be his money manager and loan him the overhead to start dealing drugs.” I had decided I wasn’t actually gonna go through with it but my dumb ass brother decided to get a guy to front him 500 dollars worth of drugs. It’s a mess. I wouldn’t be in it if it weren’t for my grandiose “I can save the world thinking.” Ugh.
BipolarReddit,f21m9u5,t3_dbbyb7,1569873898.0,"1) You blame everything on your family (grew up in abusive home. I don’t think she understood that)

2) In an inpatient unit due to what I now know was a mixed manic/depressive phase. I say, I might be bipolar, my mom is. And he says “oh you’d know by now if you were bipolar” I was like 25 that’s around when most people find out

Another thing, I am actually a counselor myself and I want to say I’m sorry about all the bad experiences you’ve had with mental health professionals. Some of the stories I hear blow me away. I think about it and am like “I can’t imagine ever saying that to a client” I’m sure there are times I’ve said the wrong things but damn, these responses show there are a lot of bad professionals out there."

Things at work have been crazy (we couldn’t live without that age old story set up) He comes home hoping to get the kiddos down to bed and have some sexy time with his wife. When he gets home however he learns one kid has been throwing up all day, the middle school kid forgot about their science project, and the high school kid just lost his virginity and wants to tell you all about how wonderful their partner is. (The kid would want to tell because his parents don’t sex shame). When he arrives home and sees the house in total chaos he realizes there will be no sexy time. He feels defeated but at least he can pleasure himself. Knowing he will only have privacy in the bathroom he goes there. For dramas sake he is just about to climax when he hears screams and a ruckus. He pulls his pants up looks down and realizes there’s nothing he can do to hide his erection it’s going to be bulging in his pants. He runs out of the bathroom and there is a bat flying around. For the sake of drama (again) the family cat is trying to catch it and destroying the house at the same time. The middle schooler finally catches the cat. The man hits the bat out of air with a pillow, grabs it, and chucks it outside. Everyone is in awe of their father. He goes to wash his hands after handling a bat. Thinks about finishing masturbating, trying to pick up where he left off but as he is thinking about the bat flying around he just isn’t as motivated. He goes back out into the family room and the three kids and his wife are retelling the story laughing and laughing. They are all bonding and cuddling and you join them. It’s a really sweet moment that you know you’ll hold onto forever. And then your sick kid throws up on you. Because realistically with sick kids that’s probably what would happen.

Edit: maybe call it something stupid like bat vs man"

I don’t think every republican is racist. I do think that those who voted for our president did vote for someone who promotes racism. I think for a lot of people it was an unintended consequence of their vote. They probably didn’t go to the polls thinking “I’m going to vote a racist into office”, at the same time though their vote helped to get him in office. I think it’s difficult because there will never be candidates that we fully agree with so we are always in a way voting for some things we don’t like about someone’s policies.

depression,eyvqxq8,t3_cz2hmz,1567508173.0,"I’m really sorry you are feeling that way. I have been there and it really sucks. I’m 30 F, a year or so ago I was homeless, I had no job, and owed a bunch of people money. The point is that I understand your feelings of looking at people around your age and comparing and being like “damn”. My social media seems like babies, marriages, and buying houses. I have 0/3. I’m just now hoping to get my own apartment. One thing that has helped me though is remembering that not everybody starts in the same place. I don’t know what your life has been like but I came from a difficult home life. I lacked the support I needed. So when I look at where I am in life it makes sense that I would feel “behind”. Or others would feel “ahead”. The thing is though, it’s relative. People with support and love growing up started “ahead” of me. So I figure I’ve traveled the life path of life just as long as them and maybe just as far. My path is just a lot curvier than other people’s paths so it feels like I’m not getting anywhere. Having to fight mental illness on the daily is something that starts us “behind” other people. Try not to compare yourself and feel your progress is insignificant. Even reaching out here on this sub is a way of helping yourself and moving forward. I hope you can find a moment of peace in your day."

ptsd,eyp6sfp,t1_eyp6gpa,1567291674.0,Well I’ve been in therapy for a while. My ptsd is related to a rough childhood. We kind of processed through the trauma and talked about how it still effects me. I would suggest finding someone who practices emdr. It’s an evidenced based practice for trauma that involves eye movements. When we have traumatic situations they are stored in the emotion part of your brain. When you do these eye movements while talking about the trauma it reprocesses the memory so that it is no longer stuck in the emotion side of the brain that brings on flash backs and such. Emdr has been the most effective treatment for me. As for bipolar learning skills to manage my moods and being faithful in taking meds in the most helpful.

relationship_advice,eycc6mi,t3_cwjzgo,1566999775.0,"I think theatre can be tricky. It’s not all too unusual to play the part of another gender so the teacher may have thought it was no big deal. However, she is 9 years old and at that age self identifying and connecting with peers is a big deal. The teacher should have at the very very least asked her if she’d be willing to play a boy character. And if it’s just a smaller role, the gender likely doesn’t matter, the teacher could rewrite it. It’s also probably not common to have grade school kids playing opposite genders.  Also, I realize teachers can not monitor and keep track of every single little thing. I would hope however the teacher would realize the bullying and how she may have contributed. As far as the other things, I like the idea of taking her shopping. I have a brother that is 18 years younger than me. My parents haven’t had tons of money so we make sure he has nicer clothes for school about once a year. My parents are happy for the help. It can be tricky though because it sounds like your parents don’t want to throw things out. Do you think they would be offended if you bought things? Also I would have the persuasive brother talk to your parents about the hair. I like that idea. Maybe if they don’t let her grow it longer you guys could figure out ways to help her style it to be more feminine. There are short pixie cuts for girls. I think all of the ideas you’ve already had are good. You mentioned something like “I don’t know if my brothers and I can give her all the help she needs” or something like that. Considering she is throwing her stuff out it seems like she is reaching a point of high emotion with the situation. I’d talk to her and try to get a feel for how she views herself. She may be having some self esteem issues due to the bullying. I’d try having a “sibling hangout” day (if that’s y’all ‘s type of thing) and do something she loves so you guys can connect. Remind her who she is isn’t about what she looks like, or what other people say, but about who she decides to be. I don’t know how helpful the school is but you might be able to talk to teachers or a school social worker if she needs some counseling or guidance at school.  Best wishes!"
