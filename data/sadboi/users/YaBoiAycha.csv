I have this friend who graduated and she has been working in another governmental bussiness (she works in TUBITAK, and programs satellites codes and trajectories) she lives very well off just in two years she has become fully independent bought herself a nice home and a nice car solely with the money she made. There are students who go for the startup or enterprise path and when they succeed they really succeed but it is still a hard path to follow. I know some alumni who work in big shot companies in US like Google. Since Bilkent has its name out there it gives you a huge advantage just by the name. Koç also. METU is less internationally recognized but it’ll also make it easier at applying jobs in Turkey. My friend in Koç also studies CS, but personally speaking i like Bilkent’s syllabus more it is more organized and efficient. Koç seems to fast forward too much or jump from topic to topic a lot. for example as they were learning Java the first semester second semester (without fully teaching java) they started learning C as well (not even C++ just C) which was pretty weird. Both are very hard school, they have zero mercy 😂. Im not like a A student im a hardcore C student so was much harder for me but if you are an A student then you will not have that much of a hard time. Bilkent also values things like extracurricular stuff such as student communities, social event etc. So they will expect you to both good at academics and real life stuff. And its very hard to balance two if you are CS student. What Koç is better at in Bilkent is I think it is a little bit more well known internationally, so they tend to get better jobs than Bilkent students when they are applying for jobs in US or Europe but it really depends on you."

Turkey,fp5d1yr,t3_gb5ka7,1588324818.0,"Ive studied CS in Bilkent University, it’s great school in all subjects. Teachers are very important and known people in the academic community. It’s in Ankara which is not the most beautiful city out there but the campus life is great, beautiful campus (one of the most beautiful places in Ankara). People are super outgoing and social, there are always something some even going on that the student communities are planning. But it is a suuuuuper hard school, the workload they give is almost infernal. But they have international accreditation which makes it easier for you to study at even more prestigious universities later on or get a good job abroad (i mean the uni itself is probably abroad for you). Koc is very similar to Bilkent the only difference is that its in Istanbul and if I’m not wrong more expensive but the experience is pretty similar. My best friend studies there and he is very happy. But I’d say Bilkent has considerably more workload, no matter the major. Even if you study graphic design or political science or any engineering they’re all equally hard. My dad is a METU alumni and that’s one of Turkey’s oldest prestigious universities but he strictly told me not to study there. Though METU also has a big name out there since its a government school they don’t get too great professors and lack in resources that private universities have easier access to. But of course not in all cases, another friend of mine majors in architecture there and she is very happy about her professors and told me that they were are really intelligent people and great teachers. I realized that even I’m confused about it but since Ive been in Bilkent if you need more questions you can go to student instagram account called @bilkentsocial and dm your questions there. Then they post your questions either anonymously or not, then people answer your questions in the comment section. Answers can get a little cynical though bc Bilkent is very hard on their students but we still love it there 😂"

The only thing that I managed to force her to do is play tennis, i had friends mom’s who were in a team so for a while now only hobby of hers was tennis and thats because she’s doing it with other people. Also she always says like she wants to travel to places but I don’t want to go anywhere with her she makes every trip miserable and she never goes anywhere without me, then she gets depressed about not going anywhere. She doesn’t want to do things alone! Doesnt even go to the mall without me sometimes!

If she has friends maybe u can urge all of them to start something together like going to yoga classes. Even at home maybe they make video meetings and do yoga or dance together. It must be hard for you to pay attention to her everytime, maybe let someone else do it sometimes ☺️ Or maybe she can try full on multi tasking. Sometimes i find it suuper hard to get motivated to do just anything I multi task. Like I watch something as I do homework while I also edit some videos.

Narcissists are super manipulative so don't beat yourself up.

As her friend, I have worked so hard to make her stop any contact with it him but her personality is just ssooooooo passive, never heard her say no to anything in my life! I think that's what happened when you get raised by a narcissist :( 

I'm so glad that you're fully aware of your situation and started making progress, it's a huge step. There's not much use trying to reason with a narcissist, because they will never accept that what they are doing is wrong. On the flip side, someone who is narcissistic usually have a horrible inferiority complex also that can explain why she needs constant attention. Maybe somewhat damaging their ego might get to them, but from my experience, it only makes things worse so I wouldn't recommend it. I think the best way is to distance yourself from her :( Oh but give me the benefit of the doubt, she might have other issues like bipolar disorder I'm no professional.

MentalHealthSupport,fow4fkz,t3_g8yewm,1588112824.0,"There seems to be another underlying issue... I'm no expert in psychology any at all so don't take my word for it. Is she easily distracted? She might have attention problems, not necessarily ADHD since it also a symptom of other disorders.

Another thing might, this is suuuuper far fetched though, in high school I had a friend who was on the autism spectrum ( it is very difficult to identify girls on the spectrum she was diagnosed years later) we took art classes together but I have never seen her finish anything. She had a hard time committing to things she always wanted to switch it up a bit. 

Your gf is probably not on the spectrum but this is a good idea to start thinking from. There might be other thoughts on her mind that might be holding her back. Like not being able to be good at the first time she does it, not being good enough, or maybe getting too lazy when she realizes it requires much more work then she realizes. Or just a straight-up fear of success? Does she seem enthusiastic when she starts something and then quickly gets bored/lazy or does she seem never too much into it?"

As a woman who has been working with these kind of cases for two years now, (I am working with a women’s protection program, that tries their best on saving these girls and serving them justice at court), its futile to blame any religion for any issue. Its nothing more than pointing fingers. These ideas of child marriages is not rooted within religion but whole human history, it is only recently that society has started to care about child brides. It doesn’t matter which country you go, if there is any kind of loose law, or loophole you can see child marriages happening. US also has lots of problems with child marriage and regulating it. It doesnt matter if you are religious or not, but society views women (no matter their age) as a commodity. Women are seen as broodmares that to be wed (owned) and used (for fornication), and that extremely dehumanizes them to do point where being a child doesn’t matter at all; because they are not humans they are girls... I have talked to few victims before, i have talked to girls who had bastard children from their fathers; imagine calling your own child both brother and son at the same time. Imagine getting abused by someone who is supposed go take care of you and raise you... And they don’t even feel remorse, if you speak to any of these rapists they’d all claim that they did the right thing and there was nothing wrong because society sides with them also! In fact Turkish Law also side with them instead of the victim, lawmakers also see these girls as commodity and sometimes even blame them for not being “better”
victims. Ive seen prosecuteds argue that “but my client paid the money to marry this girl, he didnt just raped her he married her afterwards to save her from the shame!” YES AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM MAN, THAT IS WHAT WE CALL FUCKING HUMAN RIGHTS INVASION. Which is why We try to find these girls proper lawyers and provide them with protection and therapy, because laws always ALWAYS side with the assaulter. 

Going for the solution is the key! Blaming things like “Oh these Muslims they are always like this” or “Turkish people are like this” has no benefit. ZERO SIFIR. When people sit on their assed and watch these happening and do nothing but complain it doesn’t matter! Its the same as watching a child get raped in front of you. If it was truly and completely any religion’s or any specific culture’s fault everyone who belonged to that certain community would be performing these diabolical actions. My father played a great role in me becoming a feminist, to this day he is kindest person I know and he is the best feminist and the best Muslim i know... I fully respect everyone’s beliefs, but i just hate it when people imagine scenarios like if religion didnt exist this wouldn’t happen. It would still happen, nothing would change because the way families nay THE WAY SOCIETY teach their children about women, marriage and sex is not going to change if there is religion or not. When you point fingers and say this is the Catholics fault this is the Mormons fault or this is the Muslims fault and im not muslim I don’t do these things, you are just trying to make you feel better about yourself even thought you dont take any action. Even though we try legal ways like proposing a law change we get no support, government always shuts us down because majority of the people including the government agree with these rapists also, just because it doesnt happen to you, you mom, you sister, your friend, your daughter it doesnt mine that it isnt happening or it not going to happen to you as well. 

Anyway, I digress... The point that I wanted make was when you sit at home and complain and blame others its just a narcissistic way of your coping with the problem “because you are not muslim or Turkish so you’d never do these things”. Is not the muslims fault its not the Turkish people’s fault its the fault of the rapist himself and the society that condones it. When it comes to twitter threads or hashtag suddenly everyone becomes an internet activist but when we request help in real life or when we organize protests no one cares, because its not their problem. They made their altruistic show on Twitter already and fed their egos. I am not blaming any of you guys here, or im not here to offend you. But keep in mind that discussing these is not different than condoning the rapist and the society that sides with him."

Its just a guess im not a psychologist or anything so dont take me too seriously But inherently social media is solipsistic, instead of actually presenting who you are u present who you want to be or how you want to be seen or who you think you are when you are alone. Taking selfies that u might not look flattering kind of bursts that bubble of you understanding of yourself or maybe u might get the fear that people who follow u might get the wrong idea. I am not trying offend you in any way that’s how identity works for everyone so its not a personal thing 😂 Also there’s a good reason that u hate how look in photos, its mostly likely bc you’re not used to it. For god’s sake im not even used to my reflection yet alone photos so its also a no no for me. But I guess it takes time getting used to your own skin, maybe you can try taking effortless photos to get used to seeing your face. Maybe look into some angles in order to try what flatters your best features. For example i like the roght side of my face more so I always face the camera that way (tho I only tale selfies like twice a year).

On that note, i dont think you’re missing out on much. Social media is seriously stupid, i takes time an exposure to care less about it but u eventually do. Sometimes i get downvotes here on reddit and it gets to me bc i feel Im misunderstood and o feel like that person who got downvoted isnt me. But it is! We dont get to see ourselves from the outside so we can only look into ourselves in an introspective yet biased way. I took me years to realize that I legit look so mean and unapproachable from outside but actually i see myself as a very sensitive and shy person. Social media gives you the opportunity exactly project who you see yourself as but that person might not actually be you. I bet have more qualites like that but I dont see it. For example I met certain people that genuinely considered themselves very empathetic but they never acted that way they just perceived themselves as such. This is a bit of a tangent but its good to keep in mind when using Instagram etc bc this is what they’re built upon. The sooner you realize the more you’ll care less about how many likes or followers you have. It gets to me too, im 19 i have no posts i just hang around and watch cat videos there but Ive had successful fan accounts that I never ever shared my own face yet had so much fun and satisfaction. Just share what makes u happy, I think you are what makes you happy... If selfies don’t then don’t share them who needs em there are billions of selfies there"

menwritingwomen,fojylwe,t3_g7pjlg,1587832009.0,"In my humble opinion as a reader, I enjoy characters that are effortlessly interesting and cool regardless of their gender. What happens to female characters is that writers put too much on their shoulders, like this woman shall represent all other women, represent the feminists, etc but that is also bad. It feels like women cannot be *just* characters. We feel the need to call them ""*female* characters"". ""strong *female* lead"". ""*female* warrior"" etc. Instead of trying to make a character, they make a female character and that feels so demeaning... as if she cannot be *character* enough... I don't know much about writing but I think you might do this: try not to think of your character as a symbol but think about her as if she really exists. like someone you just might now. She can have an eclectic personality like being funny or witty, or being smart or just being thoughtful and helpful. I like characters who are relatable and who really develop and change throughout the story. She doesn't need to be perfect as long as she makes mistakes -just like any of us- and learns from them and changes accordingly. She also doesn't need to be too sexy or too beautiful to be an alluring character. I think if you make her interesting, fun and unique she'd be even more alluring than a born-sexy-yesterday character. Because that'd make her realistic. Realism doesn't necessarily mean normal or boring... 

Anyways I can't English today so I am sorry if I confused you even more with my horrible train of thought and even worse language skills XD but I just wanted to add that it is so amazing that you've realized your mistakes and that you want to correct them; and I think that makes you a great writer! I really hope you can get out of this rut and become a big shot one day :)"
