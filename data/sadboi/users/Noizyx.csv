SuicideWatch,f7hy5mn,t1_f7hokr9,1573749638.0,"In that case, hold on to this thought with all your might. Use it as a shield when suicidal thoughts are coming at you. This what I do. It's difficult, and I can do just ne day at a time, but it's the only way, we can advance. Don't forget that we're the bravest persons on earth cause we fight our own mind all day, everyday, so it's ok to slip up sometimes, just if that happen hold on to your thought. Good luck buddy! I'm right there with you !"
SuicideWatch,f7hhyge,t1_f7hf9si,1573741027.0,"I'm really sorry that you have to go through that. It's truly awful. I hope that he is better where he is..
What gave you strength to advance up until now ? For me, it's my family, I don't want them to suffer. That's what kept me from killing myself."
SuicideWatch,f7h1hy7,t3_dw78jz,1573729051.0,"Yeah, I know that awful feeling, when everything was going somewhat fine, but your brain is like ""nope stop"". 
I'm here if you need to talk. When I feel overwhelmed with my thoughts I write them down, it helps me clear my mind. Hang in there ! Wish you well."

SuicideWatch,f7h136x,t3_dw7i1x,1573728446.0,"I'm really sorry to read about your situation. But you're not alone in this, you described what a lot of us are going through every day. It's so painful when the only thing you want is being normal, enjoying normal activities but your brain just doesn't comply. It makes you not care about anything and just play pretend. I'm stuck in the same situation. I'm lost at ""who I am?"", ""Do I really hate the world or do I fear it so much that it became hate?""... My brain keeps playing tricks on me...
I hope you can find the answers to your questions. The only advice I can give you is to take one day at a time and writing down what you think throughout the day to clear your  mind a bit and maybe learn things about yourself.  Good luck !"
SuicideWatch,f7enfz9,t3_dvtp9u,1573661642.0,"Hey, I'm not your therapist but we can talk if you want."
SuicideWatch,f553rry,t3_dmndf0,1571998775.0,"I feel the same way. I'm just living for my family, because I don't want to hurt them. But it's so hard living for other people, putting a smile on and pretend like you're cured. But the truth is that there is no cure  you just gotta life with it and pretend like you're not thinking about suicide every waking second.
But yeah, you gotta live cause you promised yourself you ll never hurt them. Just stick to that idea to get through the day. This is what I do and I can't give you other advice than that.
I'm here if you need to talk. Good luck, buddy!"
SuicideWatch,f4rw1cz,t3_dlkeq1,1571772146.0,"Animal Crossing is one of my favourite game too! When I was a kid I could spend my day playing on the ds version. I can't wait to have the new one on Switch.
This is not stupid to be passionate about something. This game brings you joy and this all that matter. 
I have severe depression and suicidal ideation and the only way I can get through that is by writing or drawing. Allowing yourself to be fully concentrate on one specific thing can help you clear your head from bad things.
I wish you the best :)"
mentalhealth,f35oqci,t3_dff5o6,1570684255.0,I completely agree to this. Good luck OP!
SuicideWatch,f1du7y9,t3_d8vrq3,1569399749.0,"It's what I'm going thru every day, you painted that perfectly. Great writing style, you've got a real talent there !"
SuicideWatch,f0ljcmo,t1_f0lis4l,1568720337.0,"Yeah, you're right: I can't escape from it. Life isn't worth living cause I feel it this way, and no matter what i do i can't escape what i feel. Sure, i can lie to myself and keeping me busy in order to not think about it, but the truth is always there in the corner of my eyes.
But yeah, what I want is keeping my mind busy, even if I don't want to, I need to do that. That's why i think moving away might be good. 
Thanks for your answer :)"
SuicideWatch,eydxvdp,t1_eybwncr,1567026161.0,"Gotta agree as well ! Hang in there, buddy. And never give up on writing, you have a real talent :)"
