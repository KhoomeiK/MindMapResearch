I might just have to bite the bullet and get over my fear of appointments and commitments so that I can do a day program. I have a job with good benefits and so does my partner, I just want to make sure we would still be able to pay our mortgage, etc.

Edit: I took a look at your page and congrats on being alcohol free for 30 days! It's been around a year and a half for me and it's been great. Keep going!!!!"
BPD,ffx2t1t,t1_ffx1vg2,1580316539.0,"Unfortunately we forget that Doctors are human too and they can act like garbage towards other as well. This is why recovery can be really hard for people with BPD. We are already at risk for splitting and black and white thinking, so when we experience it with a professional it feels hopeless. I've bought some DBT therapy work books to try and work out my issues on my own and it has been helpful. 

Here are links to the workbooks I've used so far, I haven't completed either of them but they've been really helpful but very challenging. Here they are:

Living with mental illness can be like that sometimes."
BPD,ffwt5un,t3_evmyof,1580310405.0,"My relationship with my dad is awful. He was always in my life growing up but not really there. He is more of a financial provider than anything. He paid for half of my school, would buy me anything I want but he was/is emotionally and verbally abusive towards me, my mom and my sister. He is textbook narcissist. He also has a drinking problem that he refuses to acknowledge. Any kind of criticism will send him into a fury of rage. Drinking, getting drunk and trying to hide it? ""I ONLY HAD ONE BEER"" as he slurs his speech and his face is red. If it's not about him he doesn't care and if it is about you, he will still find a way to make it about him. His favourite name for me is bitch. He started calling me that when I was around 11. 

I recently connected my extreme fear of abandonment to him. I recall when I was younger anytime my family would have a fight he would leave slamming the door, get into his truck saying ""I'm never coming back"" and when you are as young as 4-5 years old that can be terrifying.  My mom would always threaten to bring me to CFS as well. You end up thinking your parents treat you this way because you are a bad kid and they don't love me but in hindsight they are both mentally ill. My mom admitted to me that she and my dad had kids because they were bored. They should have never been parents and they shouldn't have stayed together. They are both too selfish to take care of a child's needs before their own. 

I haven't talked to either of them in over a year. I've sent a couple texts back responding to them during that time but that's about it. I'm trying to take back my life now that I am 25 and living on my own."
BPD,ffwq6tn,t3_evk3m8,1580308322.0,"Yes. Crocodile tears were my thing when I was very young. Fortunately I don't do that anymore but I am manipulative in different ways, usually unintentionally but still."
BPD,ffwohgd,t3_evmra5,1580307070.0,"I would say this is a misinformed person who is using their past experiences with pwBPD and projecting them onto other people. BPD does exist and the way you feel is valid! I have never personally heard it from a therapist but I've read comments on the internet from pwBPD say that they've had professionals say something similar to them. It's heartbreaking because we already struggle with our identity, self esteem, etc. and to be told that your diagnosis is bullshit is just awful."
BPD,ffwngxk,t1_ffv18bi,1580306292.0,"Yes, I'm so afraid of the stigma that surrounds people with BPD. I think it's awful that people will just assume that you will exhibit the worst parts of BPD rather then getting to know the individual. It's so sad. I think that's one of the biggest reasons I can't commit to sessions with a psychiatrist because I know there is this stigma and I definitely project it onto the professional and assume they think I'm fucking stupid and/or hopeless or whatever it is they think about us. Thanks for your input!"
BPD,ffwn8iz,t1_ffv1dmo,1580306115.0,"It would definitely be voluntary. I've gotten to the point where I probably should have been hospitalized on numerous occasions for minor psychotic episodes and self harm but I live in a rural town outside of the major city I live near so access to hospitals isn't as easy. Thanks for the advice and you as well, stay safe!"
BPD,ffwn0m2,t1_ffv98pt,1580305942.0,I live in Canada so insurance is a bit different but I'm sure there is something similar to it. I will look into it. Thank you!
BPD,ffwmxsp,t1_ffva605,1580305881.0,"Thank you for responding. This is very helpful. I agree an in-patient program seems to be more about keeping the person safe from themselves, rather than helping them work through things. It's just so hard for me to commit to anything, my anxiety always gets in the way of sessions with psychiatrists/therapists and I haven't been able to go long enough to see any progress. The only time I've been able to commit to seeing a professional was when I was younger and I had no choice because my parents would bring me. I guess I just have to get over the anxiety somehow and push through."

BPD,ffukktw,t3_ev7x75,1580243919.0,"I'm female and I've been using isolation as a coping mechanism since I was about 19 (now 25 years old). I used to be really outgoing when I was younger and than in hindsight BPD hit me like a ton of bricks around the age of 19. I've definitely shown signs and symptoms since a very young age but the isolation didn't start until I was 20 and I can't see it ever going away. I feel safe when I am alone. But I'm never really alone because I have a great partner who is a big introvert so my quiet life doesn't bother him. We enjoy ""being alone"" together."
BPD,ffujier,t3_ev5upy,1580243276.0,"I love this so much! I'm using my reddit account right now to keep track of my BPD and the progress/setbacks I face and I covered the DSM symptoms for my first entry but I agree, it's so much more than just the 9 symptoms. It's that and everything in between, all of the things people on the outside can't see because we can be very good at concealing our suffering. It's exhausting going through life seemingly 'normal' but on the inside it's the complete opposite."
BPD,ffuannz,t3_ev5qc5,1580237985.0,"I definitely think you should do what's best for you and if that means leaving your poly marriage, you should do it. I took a look at your page and it looks like you've been making tons of positive changes in your life and I think you deserve a restart. 

I have a question for you though, why did you enter into a poly relationship? Was it for yourself? Was it to keep your partner happy? Was it an idea you thought you you could handle and it turns out you can't? Whatever the reason is, that should help you make your decision. If you didn't do it for yourself I think leaving is a definite yes. Pardon my ignorance, but I feel like society sometimes makes poly relationships look edgy, cool and so progressive but in reality it's not always the case and it's definitely not for everyone. I know for a fact I could never be in one myself so don't let this make you feel like a failure. 

Anywho, I realize this is a ""venting"" post so I apologize if I crossed a line in my response. Good luck and like someone else said, we are here for you <3"
BPD,ffrpwaq,t3_euv35h,1580163190.0,"Congrats on the progress! You should be really proud of yourself :) It's not easy taking a good look at yourself and saying ""Hey, maybe some of my issues are self inflicted and I need to change the way I relate to the world."" 

I found my first real passion in a video game as well, Hollow Knight specifically and it's been great.

Keep going!"
BPD,ffrk7ji,t3_eura7c,1580159718.0,"When I realized I had BPD it was a relief. I felt like I could finally point at something and say --> That's it! That's how I feel! This sub specifically made me feel not so alone. I read everyone's posts and think, wow, I can't believe this person feels the exact same way I do, I've always felt so alone and now I don't have to. 

Reading over the symptoms helped me point out all of the ways I was going wrong as far as communication goes. My black and white thinking, the splitting, the unintentional manipulation, the push and pull...all of these things were so much easier to understand after my diagnosis. I finally realized why I was always having and identity crisis. 

Overall, it was a relief. But it's also scary. I've now been able to recognize the patterns in my life that have led me to this point and it's up to me to stop these patterns and make new ones and it's extremely challenging. Sometimes it feels like change is impossible and I doomed to repeat these cycles/patterns but I know there is hope. 

I hope my response isn't too much of a downer. I wanted to express the excitement I experienced but also the fears that came along with it. 

Good luck with your journey! <3"
BPD,ffrihi1,t3_eun3et,1580158667.0,"Yes! The only time I don't have this anxiety is when I am going to work because I know I have to make a living and earn my own (my parents didn't raise a freeloader, they always made it very clear that you have to earn your own money). Besides work, the only times I leave the house are to: 

1) Grocery shop; 

2) Take my dogs out; 

3) Smoke weed; and 

4) Whenever my partner and I go on a date. 

If there is any other type of social event planned, I usually back out due to crippling social anxiety. I hate loud noises. I can't be around drunk people unless I am also drunk and I don't drink anymore so there's that."
