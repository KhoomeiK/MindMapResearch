Deusex,fqyy2e0,t3_glff0s,1589756534.0,"It's a great mission and I always save a bunch of bio cells for the cloaked sneak out.

My favourite would probably be either the New York docks mission to catch Lebedev or the escape from UNATCO. The former is a great test of stealth and by the time you get to the aircraft, you're faced with a bunch of life-changing revelations: Paul is with the NSF, UNATCO has been playing dirty and Lebedev has surprising insight into your own history. The fact that you can choose whether to kill him, let Navarre do it or kill Navarre - without *any* prompting of your moral decision - makes it a stand-out moment of the game for me.

In the UNATCO escape, you find yourself in the very facility you once trusted and almost swore your life to. A lot of the people there are the same people you worked with not too long ago. The whole area reveals itself to be a shady, clandestine operation that you were kept in the dark about while working just upstairs. I've gone non-lethal through every playthrough I've done in this level. Sneaking around and finding out UNATCO was a front for more sinister operations was a huge turning point in the game for me, and I loved the suspense and shift in the story's dynamic."

But I can see where it might differ. Could just be an introvert who hates being outside (""my little retreat""), but soon comes to the realization that they miss the outside world.

A Forest was the first song I heard by The Cure and was the song that got me into the band. The problem with covers like this, I feel, is that they don't really capture what makes the song so unique. What I love about A Forest is the sparseness of the melody, the reverb on the guitars that rings for miles and the haunting tone of Robert Smith's vocals. When you add too much on to that, you still get a good melody, but lose the atmosphere that makes the song special. 

I get that covers are an artist's interpretation of a song, but this is a case where it just doesn't work for me."
Metal,fqqp1ac,t3_gkf84l,1589569390.0,"To re-iterate my thoughts from my review on the /r/ParadiseLostBand subreddit:

Definitely the biggest surprise of the album for me. The opening with its gentle acoustic guitars, bright symphonic notes and Nick's almost fragile crooning almost give it a country feel. But even when it kicks into the heavy part, it feels almost upbeat. Almost like they took a song from *One Second* (think Sane, This Cold Life) and translated it into their current sound. The way Greg introduces his solo is fantastic as well, it's simple but already one of the best he's ever written. It's a beautiful and exciting track that really sets the mood for the album and I feel is one of those songs that will continue to grow on me."
ParadiseLostBand,fqqoe1i,t3_gk2ozf,1589569066.0,"I wanted to give this a proper listen or two before I gave my opinion. I'm gonna go through it track by track:

- Darker Thoughts - Definitely the biggest surprise of the album for me. The opening with its gentle acoustic guitars, bright symphonic notes and Nick's almost fragile crooning almost give it a country feel. But even when it kicks into the heavy part, it feels almost upbeat. Almost like they took a song from *One Second* (think Sane, This Cold Life) and translated it into their current sound. The way Greg introduces his solo is fantastic as well, it's simple but already one of the best he's ever written. It's a beautiful and exciting track that really sets the mood for the album and I feel is one of those songs that will grow on me.

- Fall From Grace - I've already given my opinion on this one before, but it's certainly a highlight of the album. Taking the best parts of *The Plague Within* and *Medusa* and distilling it into a triumphantly melancholic song, it's one that will make you want to stand out in the rain and cry into the grey sky. Only thing that might hold it back is the similarity between the main melody of this song and Children Of Bodom's ['Prayer for the Afflicted'](https://youtu.be/ZedVYSufWSI). Of course, that song doesn't have the glorious ""we're all alone"" moment in 'Fall From Grace'.

- Ghosts - Ah, the upbeat gothic favourite. I think of songs like this as a testament to Nick and Greg's ability to write *gigantic* hooks in just about every album they put out. The vocals may be a bit monotone and the ""FOR JESUS CHRIST"" bit might be a bit hamfisted, but Nick delivers it with such conviction that I still find myself singing along to it. And it's a great headbanging tune.

- The Devil Embraced - While it doesn't capture the highs of the last few tracks, it's a sufficiently gloomy tune with good vocal lines and a great chorus section. The synth at 3:37 kinda reminds me of 'The Sufferer' from *One Second*. Another song that might take a bit more time to grow on me.

- Forsaken - A very dynamic song with great choral synths to amp up the gothic drama. This one also feels quite upbeat despite its miserable subject matter and I enjoy the riff in the chorus and the tempo changes keep the song really interesting. Again, a very sing-along chorus despite being sung with death metal growls.

- Serenity - (the chorus of 'The Rise of Denial' plays in my head every time I read that, haha). It almost feels like a miserable battle song. The mid-paced marching riffs make it feel very battle-like feel, except unlike an Amon Amarth song, it feels like you're being overwhelmed in this battle instead of coming out victorious. The clean guitars at 2:46 are a nice break in the song, and can I use this opportunity to say how much I like the clean guitar tone in this album? The reverb-drenched sound harkens back to albums like *Seventeen Seconds* by The Cure and naturally, the early Sisters of Mercy stuff. As was the intention for this album, I know, but man does it add atmosphere. 

- Ending Days - One of my favourite songs from the album. Nick's fragile vocals make a comeback in the intro and verses, and give it a desperate feel. But what really gets me are the vocals in the chorus where he brings back some of his *Draconian Times* vocal intensity. Doesn't come quite close, but is a refreshing note for a song that doesn't feature any growls. The interwoven clean guitars and touches of symphonic synths make this one of the most melancholic songs on the album and is another one that best portrays the diverse songwriting strengths of this album. Take your time with this one.

- Hope Dies Young - Seemingly every PL album has that one song that while being good, doesn't quite live up to the heights of the rest of the album. Think 'Hands of Reason' from *Draconian Times*, 'Poison' from *Icon*, *Cry Out* from *The Plague Within* to name a few. I feel like this one might be one of those as it didn't quite grab me on the first couple listens. But the wailing guitars at least make it interesting and it isn't outright a bad song. I do enjoy the vocal lines at 2:45.

- Ravenghast - A mighty album closer. The gigantic piano chord in the intro gives it quite the dramatic opening. This is a doom metal crusher through and through and feels like a sophisticated outtake from *Medusa*. While not quite the world-ending finisher that was 'Return to the Sun', it's a desolate and miserable number that feels worthy of closing the album. I actually almost wish it was a bit longer, which is something I could say about most of the album in fact.

**BONUS TRACKS**

- Hear the Night - In true Paradise Lost fashion, they leave out one the best songs from the recording session as a bonus track. Another misery-inducing doom / death song with Nick going quite high with his cleans in the chorus. Much like 'Fall From Grace', it's a culmination of some of the best parts of the last two albums. A must listen.

- Defiler - Maybe one of the less interesting songs from this recording session, but a good song overall. It reminds me of the track they wrote for the rarities collection, ['Loneliness Remains'](https://youtu.be/k5Om-ZGr1u8) with its stop-start groovy riffs and heavy-wah solos. Still a good song, I must say. I always enjoy Greg playing clean arpeggios over Aaron's heavy riffs.


OVERALL IMPRESSION:

Paradise Lost continue to outdo themselves with *Obsidian*. After *Medusa*, I wasn't quite sure what direction they would go in, but they continue to surprise me. Moments on songs like 'Darker Thoughts', 'Ghosts', and 'Ending Days' show that the band still tries to evolve their sound in interesting ways, while maintaining the core of what makes them unique. This is definitely an album that will take time to grow on me, as they've introduced lots of subtleties and nuances in their songs, something I really can appreciate after the stripped-down doom / death fest that was *Medusa*. The musicianship is also top-notch, and I'm so glad the rhythm section of Steve and Waltteri were given a chance to truly shine on this album. Nick and Greg bring their A-game with songwriting as usual. While I don't think it quite matches the heights set by *The Plague Within*, it's a more than worthy addition to a catalogue filled with highlights and I'm happy to say this album is one of them."

Sound quality is iffy but listenable, but the audio and video are noticeably not in sync. The tracks here pre-Lost Paradise songs, most of which appear on the *Drown in Darkness* compilation. 'Drown in Darkness' and 'Internal Torment' appear on their early demos, while 'Nuclear Abomination' and 'Plains of Desolation' are live-only tracks. The only track I can't identify is the one at 16:12, which isn't one I've heard before to my knowledge - it isn't on any of their demos (despite Nick saying it's on their forthcoming demo). So if someone can ID it, that would be cool.

* Interesting note about 'Drown in Darkness', while it was never re-recorded, some of its riffs were repurposed into 'Breeding Fear' off *Lost Paradise*. Similarly, the song 'Morbid Existence' off the first demo was repurposed into the songs 'Paradise Lost' and 'Internal Torment'.

They had yet to figure out their now-normal stage setup and are quite all over the place on stage. Nick deals with hecklers and calls out people quite often between songs. Overall an enjoyable show if you can get past the poor audio and video sync issues.

ParadiseLostBand,fq9xdvz,t3_ghoj27,1589208904.0,"So I'm thinking of doing a live retrospective of the band, from their earliest days to now, with any footage I can find online.

This is the earliest available recording of Paradise Lost as a band, of their third show together. They were only a band for around three months at this point and hadn't even recorded a demo yet. 

Two of the songs (Nuclear Abomination and Plains of Desolation) are unrecorded tracks only officially made available on their [Drown in Darkness](https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Paradise_Lost/Drown_in_Darkness_-_The_Early_Demos/235969) compilation, but were originally on a bootleg called [Plains of Desolation](https://www.discogs.com/Paradise-Lost-Plains-Of-Desolation/release/7029787).

Track 4 is the ""legendary"" song 'Blood Filled Eyes', which is mentioned on their [Metal Archives page](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Paradise_Lost/191) as a song played at their first rehearsal, and has never appeared elsewhere since - except this bootleg.

Tracks 3 and 5 are songs that were never featured on any bootleg or demo since. While I couldn't find any sources for their track names, the uploader of the video says they're listed as 'Horrors of Reality' and 'False Majesty'. While they are nothing too special musically, it's a treat to hear songs so rare that there's only one available source for them.

All in all, this recording captures the band in their very infancy: raw, sloppy, primitive death metal and nothing more. It's a rare and unique look at the beginnings of this iconic band. Even the demos that followed would sound more sophisticated in comparison, but as an OSDM fan, it's a delight to hear. Also, this is 1988, they were smack bang in the middle of the booming death metal movement. But they had greater things to come.

Despite being possibly my favourite game ever, this is one of the things I had an issue with the post-New York missions. There are so many points where I feel making certain actions would have dire consequences, but you could go on a complete killing spree in Hong Kong and maybe only have the cops to worry about. Especially after UNATCO turns on you, I feel like there should have been some moral implications in the game if you kill any of those soldiers, given that you've worked alongside them not too long ago. The room for morality points is quite huge, especially since you get to meet Jaime, Alex and Sam in later stages of the game.

One of the things I love about the Mass Effect series is the Paragon / Renegade system where your choices actively influence events later on in the game or series. While it isn't perfect, it does make you think about your choices, which is a big part of Deus Ex. I would have love to have seen a system like that more fully integrated into Deus Ex."

But in the mission where you have to upload Paul's co-ordinates at the NSF warehouse, the place is surrounded by UNATCO troops who turn hostile immediately after you do the upload. To avoid this I basically did non-lethal takedowns on all of them before I got to the top, which did seem like a dick move, but was an entirely practical one. 

It's what Paul would have wanted."
Deusex,fom6erx,t3_g8343h,1587879650.0,"To quote Yahtzee on the tranquilizer bow:

""It's supposed to be for stealthy, no-kill runs but it just makes enemies run around screaming for five minutes before falling over. And that's not very tranquil.""

Still my favourite weapon though. 

Also, good meme. Now I want to see a Jaime pathology on every non-lethal take-down."
Metal,fom1soj,t3_g7z8pq,1587875985.0,"When I was around 15 I discovered this album as I was starting to dig deeper into metal at the time, especially thrash. Some of my fondest memories are listening to this while playing the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games or listening to it before sports practice at school. Back when to me, metal was still a vast untapped land full of awesomeness. Such great times."
yugioh,foj8zba,t3_g7ie5n,1587813097.0,"Call me a heretic but I always thought the pose on the SDY artwork was kinda stupid. Kinda like the BEWD pose on the SKE artwork.

SYE is the most iconic one for me."
Opeth,fohdx51,t3_g7dg9y,1587764328.0,"*Still Life* is such a consistently amazing album that I struggle to think of any tracks I prefer above the others.

Ok maybe not too hot about White Cluster but even that's still a great song."
Katatonia,fohctq2,t3_g7e444,1587763822.0,"Oh man that's so cool! Enslaved did an amazing live performance that was streamed a few weeks back, wonder if this is gonna be anything like that. Definitely setting a reminder for this."
doommetal,fofdjln,t3_g762r0,1587733416.0,"I was super eager to hear this one after I heard it was heavily influenced by 80s gothic rock. PL have always been Sisters of Mercy fans and it really shows here, while still blending well with their current melodic death / doom sound. Plus the drumming is great."
ParadiseLostBand,fodguwe,t3_g6xenb,1587684523.0,"Second single is finally here! Very much a Sisters of Mercy inspired tune, but really well integrated into their current sound. Also love Nick's baritone."
doommetal,fo6euaf,t3_g5z2y7,1587556758.0,The Bill Clinton meme is still stupid but I appreciate the sentiment with the trad doom bands.
doommetal,fo694ve,t1_fo47a4b,1587551198.0,"I have nothing against stoner doom (love all the bands in that pic), but 90% of the bands that get attention here are Sleep / Electric Wizard rip-offs and trad / death / gothic doom tends to fly under the radar. 

Doesn't help that the majority of doom bands releasing albums these days are stoner doom anyway."

About to do his loyalty mission and then it's on to the Omega 4 relay. I think I'll finally be able to save my crew this time."
depechemode,fnvoi2d,t3_g3s7xf,1587300383.0,"Barrel of a Gun is such a dark and twisted song, I'm surprised it was made into a single and was the album opener.

Useless is another favourite. The bass is so sinister and I love Martin's guitar solo."
tumblr,fnog2fk,t3_g2jkpi,1587123922.0,"I finally got around to watching John Mulaney's stand up shows recently and the way he complimented his wife really made me smile.

Deusex,fno4qff,t1_fnnf4fa,1587112008.0,I assumed he recognized JC (since he was friends with Paul) and deliberately let loose that information for a few drinks. I don't think he'd be giving out that information to anyone unless they could be trusted.

Metal,fnj3jrq,t3_g1r1ud,1586991294.0,I'm glad they're getting so much attention now. *Sleep at the Edge of the Earth* was my favourite album of 2015 and they've progressed their sound spectacularly.
masseffect,fnez9x2,t1_fndskj0,1586898570.0,"That line at the beginning got my attention and I just had to stick around.

Made me realise the kind of risk Tali put herself in when I romanced her in my first playthrough. Poor thing, but she was always a favourite of mine."

tumblr,fn9jkls,t3_g0e2cn,1586775462.0,I specifically went out of my way to develop a taste for more socially acceptable music because by the time I was 19 I realised nearly everything I listened to was not for playing around friends casually.
LinkinPark,fn9g9j2,t3_g09coa,1586771818.0,This is giving me serious karaoke CD from 2001 vibes. I'm not entirely convinced it isn't. I mean it doesn't include anything after Hybrid Theory and doesn't include any of the instrumentals from HT or the HT EP.
Deusex,fn9badt,t3_g08khr,1586766244.0,"Replayed it earlier this year and did exactly this, making me wonder why I struggled with the final fight at all in the past.

Anxiety,fn6bgoi,t1_fn5mgfc,1586694447.0,"I relate to this hard. My mom pressured me in other ways, like asking me if I was busy with something important any time I seemed to be idle, and if not I would fail to get ahead in life. So I sort of developed a habit of never fully committing to my leisure activities as much as I'd have liked. I'm always living my life in fear of feeling like I'm wasting my time, regardless of whether it's justified or not."
Katatonia,fn5x1rp,t3_fzj7l6,1586678938.0,"Depends on the period of Katatonia you're looking for, tbh. 

Early death / doom albums - early Paradise Lost, Opeth, October Tide (Jonas does vocals on the first album)

Mid-era albums (*Discouraged Ones* - *Last Fair Deal Gone Down*) - difficult to find similar bands, but they borrow a lot from Slowdive, Red House Painters and The Cure. The best comparison band I can think of is mid-era Anathema, from *Alternative 4* to *A Natural Disaster*.

*Viva Emptiness* onwards - closest comparisons I could find were progressive / alternative metal / rock bands. Karnivool, Rishloo, Porcupine Tree and Riverside are obvious examples."

tumblr,fn0mwjb,t1_fn06rqj,1586544887.0,[Manilla Road](https://youtu.be/_LDWUWYBqHI) is an excellent example of that. More on the cheese factor would be [Manowar](https://youtu.be/Q5uvRd4RWs4) and something like [Visigoth](https://youtu.be/2oclDVweTR4). More on the epic side would be [Fates Warning](https://youtu.be/VmDgdDXH944) and [Gamma Ray](https://youtu.be/6NLkohhD-x4). And more on the speed side would be stuff like [Helstar](https://youtu.be/bEs1AWf1eHs) and [Liege Lord](https://youtu.be/hGPfiQeSnik).
tumblr,fmzkz3g,t3_fy2cwn,1586523474.0,"I'm always baffled at how so many iconic British TV shows have so few episodes but feel like there are so many more.

The IT Crowd has 24 episodes in total. Blackadder also has 24 episodes. Fawlty Towers has 12. Mr Bean has 15 episodes, but one would swear they've seen hundreds. 

And I get those were all shows with short running times (usually up to 5 years), but those are typically the amount of episodes a typical US show has per season. 

That was a great joke in the show though."
tumblr,fmzhmiz,t3_fycart,1586520670.0,"2 & 3 are the reasons I don't listen to much power metal, especially EUPM. Way too geeky and over-bombastic for me (even for someone who plays D&D). There are exceptions of course, but not many power metal bands really get my attention. 

But if you prefer the kind of power metal in #1, US power metal is where it's at. Helstar, Manilla Road, early Manowar and Fates Warning and some of Iced Earth's stuff, to name a few. Check out /r/USPM for the good stuff."

MetalMemes,fmtabmi,t3_fx0k33,1586369403.0,"Rare to see any memes for Paradise Lost haha 

Although I'd say S/T is the true neutral album. It's pretty much the halfway point between their classic albums and their heavier ""comeback"" stuff."

Runners up would be What the Hell Have I, I Stay Away, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here and the wonderfully lighthearted Rainier Fog video."
weezer,fmm47p0,t3_fw0ek4,1586198480.0,"No lies, as a person who listens predominantly to metal, my opinion in Weezer has gone from ""ugh, pop rock trash"", to ironic enjoyment of Say it Ain't So, to singing Buddy Holly in karaoke, to playing Weezer songs on guitar to the point I am now where I listen to fan-made compilations of *Songs From the Black Hole* for enjoyment.

That's in the span of about 2 years."
doommetal,fmlaq5a,t3_fvqgsp,1586182552.0,"Blew has one of my favourite riffs of all time. So heavy and sludgy. And it's in drop-C too, very few bands were going that low back then."
Metal,fmfjig7,t1_fme9gx2,1586028560.0,"Usually Testament albums have a couple of stand out tracks, but most of this new album really is quite unremarkable and meandering. I still think *Dark Roots of Earth* is their best album post-reunion. That album at least had many songs that were memorable and to the point, even if it's not my favourite Testament album."
BlackMetal,fm6ai0a,t1_fm63gzz,1585789782.0,"There's a recording of them playing it for the first time in 2014 and Grutle said they never do it live because it's a difficult song to perform. But I they've been doing it live a lot more in the last couple years, [according to setlist.fm](https://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/enslaved-43d68383.html?song=Havenless).

Really shows you how far their influence spread.

The guys are also super humble and funny, love their dry humour. Well worth a watch."

Also I've never been a huge fan of this song, but I feel like it could be put over a Mission: Impossible type montage. Y'know like that dreadful Metallica song, [I Disappear](https://youtu.be/ekZTW2r4vb4)."
BlackMetal,fm5cx4f,t3_ft3rup,1585770589.0,"It was an amazing show. Visually impressive as any professional show would be. And they nailed those songs, I've never seen Havenless performed that well, they usually seem to avoid playing that one live. Sacred Horse was a mesmerizing performance too."
