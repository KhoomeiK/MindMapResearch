ForeverAlone,fpq71xo,t3_gevkjt,1588816464.0,"I’m just too different. I was a kid who received a ton of abuse on account of being a fat Mexican in a largely white area. This led to me literally only playing video games as a cope thus leading to me miss out on formative experiences that lend a person the qualities needed to be attractive to women. Despite losing the weight, the mental damage and lack of life-experience  has ruined any potential attraction anyone could feel for me."

ForeverAlone,fgazoio,t1_fga7qmh,1580657009.0,Yeah people need to be in a good state if mind to smile and some of us just don’t have that. A lot of normal people are not capable of fathoming being in a state of enough pain that leads to one becoming a zombie-like shell of what they think a person *is supposed to be*

I am sure it is something that only gets worse, and while I do try to socialize, it’s honestly just my personality that turns people off. I definitely can’t change my entire self and trying to act as another person is something that I will definitely fail at eventually"
ForeverAlone,ffc665v,t3_estrhk,1579792450.0,"Sorry to hear that your having a hard time, but based off of your post you are really not in a position to be receiving advice from people here. Many of us would kill to have people that are into them at all, or to ever even have had a relationship to begin with. The *forever* in forever alone really rings true here."
ForeverAlone,fdj1uag,t3_eli3z2,1578456268.0,"I’ve developed some sort of anxiety and stress based insomnia which basically leads to nightmares then the inability to return to sleep as a consequence of me having an anxiety attack then and there.

The dreams are mostly hellish nightmares which involve torture, being chased, trapped etc. Literally always horror movie shit with me being the star, I’m pretty sure most of them take place in Hell, yet these dreams leave me in a better state than dreams of escaping FA status does.

I guess the fact that they are so far removed from reality allows me to recover from them much more easily than basic dreams of escaping FA. Happy dreams full of love etc, always leave with the notion that I can’t have that in reality thus leaving my psyche to cope through dreams."
ForeverAlone,fdi88fu,t1_fdi7g2d,1578437492.0,"I’m sorry to hear about that, childhood trauma is one of the most detrimental things that can happen to one’s development, and I’m happy to hear your mother wound up turning a new leaf.

The comment wasn’t meant to discredit you or your past, but was my observations regarding the impossibility of applying the advice of finding something fulfilling to aid in escaping FA, for individuals who have lost the capacity to feel joy for anything other than being loved for once."
ForeverAlone,fdi783e,t3_elijsq,1578436965.0,"Finding “something to dedicate yourself to” is something that is impossible for people whose self-perceptions and basic development have been ruined by abuse. For people like that, including myself, depression has absolutely ruined any sense of enjoying anything that does not resemble being loved and being shown that their past does not represent their future. 

Telling some one in that state, to just go out and dedicate themselves to something that’ll allow them to produce self-worth is condescending and misunderstands where their pain comes from and what is required to fix it.

Also, while the point about feeling bad about yourself being counterproductive is valid, many people on this sub have accepted that and done an incredible amount of work on themselves and have never gotten what they needed out of it. 

However I am glad that you figured out a way to get out of being FA, through something that worked for you, but that something is something that I’d say is not applicable to many people on this sub."

depression,fdby2qm,t1_fdbwz4g,1578263639.0,"The competition aspect is definitely something I feel, not only is it a huge awful race, but those who are lag behind early stay behind and aren’t ever able to drop out of it."
depression,fctysdh,t3_eix1cj,1577966218.0,"Yeah I can relate to being someone with both shite personality and being ugly too. My childhood was ruined by the way I was relentlessly abused by my peers for being the only Mexican around and being one of the few fat people. Nothing was done despite the obvious signs and I’m convinced those experiences ruined me then and there.

Not only am I ugly, but I’m quick to anger and self-hatred, incredibly high in in neuroticism, blank out often in social situations, and lack many of the formative experiences required to be a functioning human being.

I currently started college and am seeing my fellow peers effortlessly lead lives of love, friendships, good times and having the time of their lives as you put it. Pretty much a complete failure and idk if I’ll be able to finish it without breaking.

So at least you can see that your not alone, if that provides any comfort. As for the failure at the contact center, I hope you can see that a job like that in of itself would be hard for someone with low-self esteem, and since at least from my view, your issues are more of a consequence of things beyond your control and thus I wish you some peace with dealing with that issue.

But yeah I’m sorry you feel like a tumor, but despite how bad I feel right now, I at least try to believe that people like us can find an amount of value in finding something to do that we can take pride in I guess. Idk what that would look like for you, and have no idea what it would look like for me, but I wish you the best in somehow finding something that can make you feel valuable."
BodyDysmorphia,fcr7vbo,t3_eik2mc,1577898060.0,"I’m really sorry to hear about your situation friend, my high school situation was pretty similar and it always prevented me from fulfilling any potential that I may have had during those years.

The only advice i can give is to try and create or learn something that gives you some pride. You’ve probably heard this before, and I can’t even tell you what I am trying to do since I am still figuring out how I can salvage a decent life from my situation, but it is honestly the only path I see for someone like me. 

Sorry I couldn’t give you better advice, but just know that there are others just like you and that I’m sure we are all really rooting for you, I know I am."

It really kills me when everyone has that special someone in gatherings to tag along with all while enjoying the company of others and knowing that I’ll never be that person for anyone"
depression,fcn0e41,t1_fcmph4w,1577799567.0,"Exactly, the basics for others all I can ever strive for. Dealing with pain for too long fundamentally destroys a person’s ability to be a basic functioning human being."
depression,fcn08vx,t1_fcmbpzx,1577799430.0,"Thanks for the advice, but my issue isn’t so much that those who hurt me determined my value as much as the damage dealt to me by them has destroyed my ability to ever grow into a good/valuable person that I could ever deem respectable."
depression,fcm7sgj,t3_ehtpnj,1577766489.0,"Yeah I’ve thought about that too, it’s weird because once you’ve been dealing with depression for long enough it becomes a part of you. I have no idea what living without pain is like, and it’s really always been something that has affected the way I feel, think, and behave."
depression,fcluspj,t3_ehvgte,1577756982.0,"If God exists I’m convinced he is not benevolent. Based off of the undeserved suffering I have experienced and the undeserved suffering of others I have seen in this life, this fact is plain as day.

If God and your life is an area of pain, I’d personally recommend operating as if God isn’t involved in your life. As someone from a very religious background to becoming agnostic, I understand that behaving as if he’s apathetic or non-existent is difficult, but it honestly saves you a lot of time and feelings of betrayal when it comes to pondering how things got the way they did.

Either way I’m sure anyone who has experienced extreme undeserved pain would make a far better omnipotent being than the one we look up to, and I hope that you can find some peace friend."

Whoever told you it’s a bad and unnatural way of thinking is definitely right as our main biological drives are to survive and reproduce etc, but when life puts you through the wringer, escaping it seems like the logical solution after a while.

All I can say is I’m sorry that you’ve come to this point, and that I hope things work out for you when it comes to living man"

depression,falm91h,t1_fall60i,1576186720.0,"Thanks lol, but yeah I guess karma and true justice are non-existent in this world, despite the part of me that tries to operate as if it did. I also agree on the grateful front, I actually had Leukemia as a child and managed to pull through and often wish that I had died then as an innocent child. It would have saved me the trouble of growing to be like this.

It’s been really good talking to you btw, I don’t really post on reddit and literally only follow the communities that relate to my issues so that I can see what others think. This convo eased my pain for a while, and I wish you the best of luck in finding something fulfilling in your life."
depression,falkfyz,t1_faljmnd,1576185852.0,"100% agree. What happened to your family member and what is happening to us is dreadful. I can’t sleep anymore since my dreams have turned into a god damn suicide fuel fest and waking up just to go about the same day over again is hellish, I am a walking sack of dread who’s main cope is doing something else to forget about my life. Dying of a stress induced heart attack or something is definitely possible at this point. 

It definitely seems like a curse and it kills me knowing that people like us haven’t done anything to deserve this pain."
depression,faliscp,t1_falhm0p,1576185065.0,"Yeah genetics, who we were born from, where we were born at, the shitty ways we are treated, are not really our fault. Yet they determine so much about what we will become. While we can do our best to change ourselves it cannot be denied that some people start out life on Very Hard difficultly and are expected to perform on the levels who are on Normal or Easy.

Also your experiences correlate with mine almost exactly, and I’m at the point where I am doing all that I can to improve myself with my given circumstances and am seeing no results. I gave up on religion a long time ago, and would probably identify as Agnostic, leaning more towards Atheist. And yet, despite knowing better, I feel like me doing all that I can to improve deserves a reward in some way shape or form.

I know it’s childish, but god damn does existing feel like a punishment"
depression,falgqw5,t1_falet7k,1576184098.0,"Yeah that’s honestly the real shame of it all for some of us.

depression,fale2i5,t1_fald4yl,1576182827.0,"I know what you mean about the shame, I would always feel the same way. However, it’s important to remember that the little things add up. Failing Math leads to a damaged mental state, which then affects you elsewhere, and eventually these thing add up to ruin one’s life.

When thinking about where it all went wrong for myself at least, I see a trail of negative moments that lead to further failure which compounded to me being who I am now. A failure who has never done anything for himself, never had an SO, always been the outsider, etc etc..."

It really sucks, and I wish us all a better state of mind."
