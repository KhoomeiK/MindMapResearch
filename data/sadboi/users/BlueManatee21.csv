I eventually went on meds and got better but still had anxiety. So much more anxiety compared to before I started grad school. I think the constant stress really does change something about your body's baseline. When you feel like you should constantly be working to finish a project but the project takes 4 years you're running a marathon, during which time you cannot ever fully relax.

I finished my degree a few months ago and for the first two months or so I was still so anxious and worried all the time, I had to learn how to relax all over again. It's like I had to reprogram my brain to not be constantly on alert. Now I'm doing much better and have started tapering off my meds with no ill effect so far and I'm amazed."
relationship_advice,foy9od6,t3_ga6ezs,1588168386.0,"My mom had cancer when I was in high school too, she passed away two years ago. Don't beat yourself up for being a normal teenager during the past 4 years. I was very similar, I kept trying to pretend that everything is okay and it's really part of a coping mechanism. High school is stressful and a weird time in a person's development, you're trying to figure out who you are, make friends, think about your future, etc., it's normal to have wanted to have normalcy. I was lucky that she held on well into my 20s. I regret some of the times that I chose to not spend time with her, but now I try to hold onto all the good times we did have, and I'm sure that's what she would've wanted.

For mother's day, I say just plan a very nice but somewhat ordinary day with her. Make her favorite foods (if she could still eat them). Maybe watch a movie or show that she loves or one that you remeber really enjoying together. Set some time aside and tell her you love her and and ask her questions, let her tell stories. Ask her how you were like when you were a kid. Ask her what her fondest memories from her childhood were. Just talk and soak up as much mom as possible.

Another thing, when I knew she was about to pass away, my bf suggested I write down all the things I want to do with her before she passes, all the questions I want to ask, all the things I want to do with her. Sit down and make a list, this gives you time to really think about what you want to do for the remainder of her time. You may not get to do all the things, but you'll get to do some at least. Rank them in priority. For example, one of mine was simply tell her I love her (my family is not very expressive normally), another one was to ask if she has name suggestions for my future kids.

You've got this. Make the most of it, but don't feel pressured to make it perfect, cancer sucks and it doesn't like following plans. Just spend time with her. Hold her hand. Make stupid jokes. We laughed a lot even a few days before she became unconscious. Message me if you need to talk at any time. This sucks a lot and I remeber most of my peers had no idea what to do with or react to all my grief, it's not their fault, but it made me feel lonely.

Lots of hugs."

depression,f4p20gb,t3_dkx9yc,1571713817.0,"First of all I want to give you a hug. Sounds like you were and still are in so much pain and I sympathize.

When I was in the depth of my depression and would sit for hours on my couch paralyzed and doing nothing, I would occasionally manage to get things done by designating a reward. Like I love cake. Even when I'm really sad and lost interest in other things I still enjoyed cake. Food is an easy source of comfort. I'd tell myself if I get out of the house and go grocery shopping, or if I get this school thing done, I can go buy a slice of cake. Even if I cried while eating said cake it was kind of nice.

I think school might be nice, it's a good way to meet people and build a new social circle. It's also a way to give your life more structure and clearer gosls. However, it might also be stressful and make things worse. Is there a way to do part time? If your financial situation and school allows you to, maybe start out part time and we show you feel? One upside to going back to school is that many universities provide mental health counseling, so you might gain more access to help.

I think you could be honest with your friends about what happened. No use to sugar coat it. Chances are they will be mortified, but those that care for you will then become more aware. When I was suicidal I finally broke down one day and told my boyfriend and my closest friend. She started texting me every other day or so asking me how I'm feeling. It's nice to know that someone cares even when things are really shitty. Medication and therapy helped me but a bit part of what made things feel better was knowing people love me and would still want to be around me when I was at my lowest when I assumed I was horrible to be around. It doesn't necessarily make the pain go away but it does help stabilize things.

I trained myself to tell myself that the negative things told to me by my brain are lies. ""I want to die"" ""no, that's your depression brain speaking, I want to live, I have things I want to do"", ""you suck and nobody finds you funny"" ""no, I have friends, that's proof that I don't suck"". Things like that.

If you could, getting a pet could be very helpful. I didn't get my own pet but I moved in with a roommate that has a dog. The dog has helped me so much. On days I was too unmotivated to do anything I'd force myself to walk her because she loves it. And after I come back from the walk things will feel better. Also having a furry animal who loves you really makes you feel that the world isn't so bad.

Good luck. We are here for you."

That wasn't the cause of my depression as I've had it for a long time, but I knew I couldn't kill myself because how could I do this to my parents in a time like this. So the only alternative was to get help. So I started therapy and eventually my therapist convinced me (very gently) that medication would be worth a shot given my history, and I got on medication. My god did things change. It took three months for the medication to fully settle with my brain and for the side effects to go away and it took some dosage adjusting. But man. I remeber sitting outside one day and I thought to myself ""I'm glad to be alive"" and I genuinely meant that for the first time in a long time and I almost burst into tears I was so relieved to not have to wrestle with my brain to stay alive anymore."

Breadit,ezvk6ww,t3_d2a759,1568181592.0,I approve of drunk baking. Just be careful not to accidentally burn yourself. Or fall asleep with the oven on. Otherwise drunk baking sounds magical. Make more drunk bread creatures please.

personalfinance,eza8mtm,t1_ez9gkyq,1567796779.0,"Is there is a thrift store or Good Will around I've gotten cheap furniture that work perfectly fine from those places before. Takes a lot of looking in from time to time though. If there's a college town nearby, summer is a great time to look for furniture at Goodwill and thrift stores in those towns, all the students donate their things as they desperately try to get rid of their stuff."

JUSTNOMIL,eysr5ch,t3_cyhwtp,1567409536.0,"Holy shit. J can't believe other siblings all went though this when they had their LOs. What makes your MIL so great that her bullshit needs to be tolerated?? I don't see how she's adding any positivity or value to your family life. Therefore, she doesn't need to be included in your family life. Not to mention she is insane and has the audacity and arrogance to assume you'll follow her rules for YOUR CHILD. What gives her the right?

I'm with the other comments that say to move. Out physical distance between you and your MIL. Find a different hospital to deliver in near your family. Don't tell her where you move to. I've never felt so violated in my life listening to all that and I'm not even you. Holy shit."

tifu,eyp8ly4,t3_cxylio,1567293096.0,"Even if your accusation was untrue he handled it terribly. I get he might be feeling hurt but it in no way justifies everything he did afterwards. The anal with no compassion for your well-being was super fucked up. If he truly loves you and cares about you he would've been hurt by your accusation, he would've been angry, but he would also recognize that you feel insecure and want to figure out why and work on it. It sound alike you accusing him gave him an ""out"" and he used it as an excuse to squeeze one hate fuck out if you. I don't think this is a TIFU. I think you just got to see his true colors."

GradSchool,ey6szdv,t3_cvtk6a,1566863324.0,"My mom passed away when I had a year left. While my PI was supportive while I took time off overall my project was a political nightmare because of something my PI did with a collaborator.

Does your school have some kind of academic leave you can go on? My school has one where grad students can take up to three quarters off. We don't get paid during that time off but I was glad I took one quarter off to deal with funeral arrangements and grieving.

I thought about quitting so many times, but what ultimately helped me push through was the thought that my mom was so excited when I got into grad school. She'd be so proud when I finish. I changed my desktop picture to her and used that to motivate myself. It still sucked, this past year, but I'm almost at a final draft of my thesis.

Good luck. I here if you'd need an ear."
GradSchool,ey0fw1g,t3_cutzvo,1566678573.0,"My mom was doing poorly (terminal cancer) for a few months and passed at the end of a quarter during which I was teaching. I talked to the professor I was TAing for and got to miss the first week of the quarter to spend extra time with her, and then missed the final exams to rush home to be with her in her final 10 days. My advisor was more than understanding even though he's usually very tough and doesn't maintain work life balance very well himself. He said take as much time as I need.

Definitely talk to anyone you need to talk to to be able to take time off. If you can't, withdrawing and then readmission is usually an option.

You only have one mom and now to spend with here, you have the rest of your life to figure out grad school. Don't feel weird about taking time off. And if anyone gives you shit for it (I've heard of shitty professors getting mad at students for taking time off for family emergencies) theyre not worth listening to. Think in terms of what you'd regret if you don't do now when you look back at this moment decades from now.

Feel free, OP, and any other grad students in the comments if you need someone to lend an ear. Grad school is hard enough without dealing with this kind of loss. You are smart, you are strong, and we got you."

Take care of your body, the whiplash is real and awful. Physical therapy if you need it. And get a personal injury lawyer helps with navigating all the insurance headache."
