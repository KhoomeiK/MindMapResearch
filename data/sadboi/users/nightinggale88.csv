I will discuss surface interests and whatnot with most people but, the older I get and the more of a healthy mindset that I develop, I come more and more to the conclusion I come that I do not need to share myself with other people- especially people I do not have an established, trusting relationship with. I don't want to give myself to people who I do not know very well and I've completely stopped any sort of friendships online and just focused my energy on the people who are physically in my life (or people I have moved away from but have known IRL). It is mostly a personal choice but it really has helped me to maintain more of a genuine presence in the world because I do not feel that I am sharing myself with people who are or could potentially be untrustworthy. That security is worth quite a lot to me."
AdultChildren,fp8gn2s,t3_gbriya,1588391801.0,"> For all my life I’ve been thinking that’s it’s not morally good to burden people with my deeper issues that go beyond simple everyday life problems. 

For me, at least, I felt this way because I felt like *I* was the burden and I felt that I was bothering people by being close to them in this way. As StrSid said, it is a sign of intimacy to share this level of closeness with someone. Trusting, safe relationships go deeper than everyday life problems. It is normal that, once relationships progress to a certain point and if you feel safe doing so, you share your deeper thoughts/issues with each other. 

I think that a therapist is a healthy step toward healing, especially if you have had a troubled past and want someone to talk to. They are a non-judgemental sounding board that can help you with coping tools and processing your story. I feel like I made exceptional progress in my life overall in terms of emotional maturity, establishing boundaries, gaining a sense of self & direction, and choosing coping mechanisms and routines that were healthy for me as well as that fit into my lifestyle when I started seeing a therapist who specializes in trauma. 

If you trust your mom and if she has been someone that you have been able to depend on in the past or you think that you are safe giving her your feelings, then yes, I would say that it is a wonderful idea to include her in your process.

AdultChildren,fp0l8e4,t3_gamjcu,1588211522.0,"I would say that it depends on what you're looking for. If you need addiction help, maybe look for an addiction counselor. If you need someone who specializes in PTSD, look at their qualifications. I believe if you search for therapists in your area, there should be a list in Psychology Today with a brief description the therapist writes with the style of therapy they provide and some of the areas that they have worked in. 

The relationship is what heals. You need to have a good, trusting relationship with your therapist in order to work through your issues. You're going to be sharing intimate details of your life that you may not have shared with anyone before and you will want to be comfortable and feel safe doing so. You may go through a couple of different trial appointments before you find a good fit. A lot of them will do a consultation over the phone/computer/in person (if not for the virus) to get a feel for how you will mesh together. I generally take this time to ask questions about their time practicing and then let them know what I am looking for. In this way, you can both decide if you are a good fit. If not, no harm done. They may have recommendations on who to try next if that is the case. 

Best of luck!"
AdultChildren,foxgydt,t3_ga37gd,1588143674.0,"I can weigh in here but, keep in mind that every person's experience is unique to them so my word isn't necessarily going to apply. I had a rough childhood and was diagnosed with complex PTSD. I have experienced night terrors for about the last 20 years (31 years old for reference). I sought treatment and went through quite a few prescription drugs that seemed to make the situation worse. I have been seeing a trauma therapist for over a year now and, though we do not spend much time at all on my night terrors, they have decreased significantly. I started keeping a sleep journal and noticed that when my stress levels were up, I was more likely to experience night terrors. 

Overall, my sense of helplessness surrounding the night terrors is very high in the moment- almost as if I am a child again and there is nothing that I can do to stop what is happening to me. What I've started doing once I'm fairly awake directly after an episode is that I will grab my phone and turn on the flashlight function and take in my surroundings. This helps me to see that there is nothing in the shadows, I am in a safe place, and there is no threat. Additionally, I will often tell myself, out loud, that I am an adult and I am in charge of what happens to me. It sounds corny but, for my issue, it really helps instill some confidence in myself when I need it most. I've read a little bit on this and have seen that it stems from not feeling safe when in your most vulnerable state. 

All of that being said, maybe ask him if you can help him in any way. I know that, for me, there's nothing to be done in the moment except for shining a light around and telling myself that I'm safe. The more that I've been practicing these things, the longer I will go before I have a cluster of episodes. The longer I have been practicing healing from my past, the less they seem to happen as well.

AdultChildren,fot75oh,t3_g98z5x,1588046180.0,"Your memories are valid and what you remember matters and is true. 

Some people chase substances to drown out the sorrow of their lives and often live in denial of the pain that they cause others. They see themselves as the victim because that is how they were raised to think. Confronting the idea that they are not the victim can be painful and nearly impossible for some people because it means that they must take responsibility for their actions and (hopefully) begin to change as a result. Any sort of growth or change is so difficult for most people and, when you have a substance abuse problem on top of it, facing the idea that you have been living your life in a way that harms yourself and other people is doubly terrifying. I say this in order to understand why people deny their wrong-doings or shutter from the way that they conduct their lives, not to excuse people who do so. 

All of that being said, hold onto what you know is true. Do not let someone else decide for you what happened to you and what did not. It is utterly atrocious that you must live with the abuse inflicted upon you and to hear your abuser demand an apology. It sounds like he externalized and made you the problem rather than searching his soul for the truth, recognizing where he was wrong, and attempting a path to correct it. 

One thing that stands out to me about your post is that you seem to be struggling with the reality that you lived through and the reality that your brother and dad are presenting and enforcing currently. I can't say this enough because this sort of thing really held me back in life and I hope that you can reach healing from this sooner rather than later; do not let someone else determine your reality. What you went through was real. It was terrible. Now, you are making the effort to live a different way than the one you were taught. You are making a difference for yourself and the life that you lead. How dare they come into your life and demand validation for the abuse that your father inflicted upon you? If this were me, I would acknowledge my true feelings for the parent/guardian/family member and then try to move past it. It would be so painful because I want people to be happy and do not want to be the cause of suffering for anyone but, their suffering is not truly my problem. If you do not specifically set out with malicious intent to hurt anyone, their response is their own and you do not have to feel poorly because you did what was right and true for you with compassion and love in your heart. You control what YOU put into the universe, not what others put into it. 

His death is something that you have to live through. He does not have to live through his death. That does not mean that he isn't entitled to say and do what he feels that he should do before he passes, it just means that you will have the lingering memories of this for the rest of your life. Just because someone is dying does not mean that they can access your emotional availability. You are so courageous in realizing and acknowledging your truth. Let that courage guide you in the coming days, weeks, and months. Respond with love when you can, do not respond when you feel that you cannot. Your father and brother live their own truths (denials) but you know what happened and you have the option to preserve yourself through this and not let what they are putting forward out of shifted reality settle on you.

Above all, hold on to your truth. No one else has a right to it."

AdultChildren,foqv53y,t3_g91zre,1588001378.0,"I hear you- I struggled with this up until about a year and a half ago. The thing that clicked for me was that I had to embrace that their only intention was to check in and say something nice. A lot of people are kind in that way. However, my upbringing taught me to be distrustful and so, while part of me knew that they were just being kind, there were underlying suspicions and dread on my part.    


We are so used to having to anticipate the needs of our parents/guardians that it creates great anxiety in facing the unknown and things that are outside of our control. What I see from your post here is that you do not know exactly what to say to them to make the conversation go 'well' in accordance with their expectations. This is not only a mind trap but, it also prevents you from being in touch with yourself and responding in an authentic manner. Your purpose in life is not to rise to the perceived expectations of others; it is to live your life the best and most genuine way that you desire to.   


In my journey, I found freedom in the fact that the more I love myself, the less that I feel like I need to police my actions. I trust my instincts more and flounder less with questioning my replies because I started responding with love rather than fear.   


I would say that, if you feel dread when they text you, it is possibly because you feel a desire to reciprocate their 'fluff' texts and to not bog them down with the minute details of your life. You said it yourself; you do not have a whole lot going on right now beyond your program and work. When you assume that you are boring them with a reply text or not living up to their expectations, you are taking away their responses to you and replacing them with your own assumptions. I think that one thing that we all need in order to live freely is that we must give other people's expectations to them and not forecast their response or intentions for ourselves before we even receive it. It sounds like you are assuming that they would be bored by your responses or that they would not understand you because they are the 'nice side' of your family. What if your genuine responses are exactly what they are looking for? Additionally, need everyone completely GET us in order to have a conversation with them? It can be a bit awkward to start conversations with people you do not know very well, even within your familial unit. You do not have to have deep, soul-touching conversations with your family members if you do not want to. The bonds of blood are strong, yes, but you choose who to connect with on more profound, vulnerable levels. 

&#x200B;

> I feel like my true self isn't allowed to make connections with people in the world. 

This one really touched me because I often felt the same way. I felt like I had to bare my soul to people in order to connect to them. For some connections, that is required. But when it is safe to do so. Not everyone has a right to know your soul. That is a part of you that you can choose to show to people who help you feel safe and right revealing it to. You do not have to give a piece of yourself to everyone- not even family. The beauty of choice is that you get to decide what you give and to whom. If you are worn down by work and all you have in you is an, ""My day was a bit exhausting so I'm going to unwind with a bath right now,"" then that is all that you have to give. You would be surprised at how many people are completely accepting of this and will respond with a, ""Just checking in- enjoy your bath!"" sort of attitude. And if they press the issue or want more details and you don't want to talk about it, you can say that too. Protect your energy. It is not a bad or selfish thing to reply simply that you cannot talk or that you need to rest and will catch up with them later. It just feels bad because we are so programmed to giving our everything to our parents/guardians so that we could feel secure/loved/valued for a short period of time. You have value beyond the responses that you give to people and that value is worth cherishing and protecting. And that true self, who has value and is cherished by you, they are free to make the kinds of connections that are good for them.

It sounds like your parents are not a safe or good support system for you. What I hear from you is that the world around you is crumbling and the people in your close vicinity who you should naturally be able to rely upon are instead relying heavily upon you and it is completely stressing you out. Having to parent our parents is something that we expect to do as Adult Children but it never ceases to create turmoil in our lives- most especially when we need to feel safe and supported. 

It really does suck that they are checked out during a global pandemic when their child could use some reassurance that the world is still turning. Assuming the role of parent for an alcoholic is a special kind of punishment. They're old enough and should have enough life experience under their belts to know better. After all, don't WE, their children, know better? It certainly seems that we do if we are the ones doing the heavy lifting and worrying about if they're going to hurt themselves falling.

I'm there with you. The one parent that I am still in contact with decided that he wanted to start drinking again and I sometimes get late night phone calls or texts telling me how much he loves me and how sad he is with how my siblings turned out.

I don't think that I have the right to shove my issues into someone else's life- particularly if we are not in a close relationship.

This is an interesting question but, I think we need to first take a look at the word 'vulgar,' and what it means to your question. People talking to themselves is not necessarily vulgar. Yelling, using foul language, and being threatening are vulgar. I think perhaps a better word for what you're trying to achieve might be 'agitation'. You can be agitated without being vulgar but, the behavior you are describing here fits agitation more. Generally, vulgarity is a product of agitation. It is also easier to quantify agitation than vulgarity. 

The reason I walked you through changing up the verbage of your question is so that you can apply that to future questions. When we want an answer for something, it is best to leave out or replace words which do not serve your purpose or those that can lead to confusion. When we are pondering a hypothesis, it is best to get to the heart of what we're asking before we go about testing it. Your question essentially asked if people experiencing psychosis were offensive and crass because of their mental state. Further down though, you wondered if non-threatening (not vulgar) people with psychosis are less likely to be homeless. That is another question entirely but, it shows me that you want your question to encompass people who are experiencing psychosis but are not necessarily vulgar. Ergo, I thought it was best to pick a word that fits both but shows that the sufferer is still exhibiting symptoms of discomfort; agitation.

Now we've got, ""does psychosis cause agitation?"" 

There is actually quite a bit of research to show that people who are experiencing psychosis also experience agitation. If you Google it, you can find plenty of information on it. I recommend reading through the scholarly articles (can fit into your Google search) for a bulk of your information. If you are not used to reading research papers, it can be difficult. The abstract and conclusion portions are good to read if you want to skim the rest.

The full answer to this is pretty lengthy (for me, but I'm a wordy person). The one thing that I keep in mind during social interactions now is that not everyone should know that much about me. Trust must be implemented before I become too attached and divulge deep information. 

I am not a particularly guarded person but, I feel like if  the relationship does not evolve and instead fizzles out, then I've given someone who has no place in my life a piece of myself. Ya know?"
askpsychology,exc196l,t3_cs217u,1566141770.0,"Journaling is a coping strategy for many people. For some, seeing the words on paper and being able to express what is going on cognitively in an external manner is helpful. It can help compartmentalize their anxiety/issue both in the moment and long-term. Generally, journaling, along with various other types of coping strategies (exercise, listening to music, going for a walk in nature) are considered to be beneficial because they are helpful, constructive ways to handle stressful situations and feelings. 

Coping strategies are generally used to help manage stress, anxiety, depression, etc. Some are helpful, some are not. The unhelpful and dysfunctional ones include avoidance and substance abuse. They are still considered coping strategies because they help the person to ""cope"" with their feelings by either avoiding them or by drowning them in substances. They are dysfunctional because they are not helpful in the long-run. They do not teach the person utilizing them to handle stress in a healthy way and they also create a destructive routine for the person to fit into over time. 

I think that you are asking a good question. Are people who employ coping skills, such as journaling, putting off dealing with their issues? The answer to this is not as cut and dry as that. However, I would say that they are dealing with their stress in a healthy manner. Journaling often encourages organization of thought process as well as introspection. Comforting techniques such as listening to music can help diffuse a stressful situation and set the ton for a calmer mindset in which the person can then think about the situation in a more calm manner. It is not about running away from problems but about being able to think about them with a less stressful mindset so as to sort the problems in a healthy, constructive way."

mentalhealth,ex7d3jc,t3_crn6i0,1566058987.0,"A trick of mine that I employ; is this thought helpful or hurtful? 

* If helpful (meaning that it adds to my overall well-being and contains reasonably sound logic), then I will list the ways in which it is helpful and take comfort in that. 
* If hurtful (meaning that it causes distress), I will decide if there is logic being employed or if the hurtful thought I am having is likely to come true. For people with anxiety, it is always appropriate to examine hurtful thoughts and ways of thinking so that the cognitive map can be reasoned with. For instance, people with anxiety often search for something negative to happen, even when no threat is present. What are the chances that this negative thing will happen? The thinker must challenge their thoughts with real-life scenarios and what their reasons are for assuming that an adverse outcome is the most likely one.

If I simply *must* indulge my anxiety, I often challenge my own hurtful thoughts with; what is the worst that could happen? Then, I think of the worst possible thing that could happen and I envision myself overcoming it with grace and competence. 

Let's be real though. You do not really know what to expect and the unknown is a reasonable fear to have. You have a brand new set of people to work with so you are outside of your comfort zone. That's pretty darn scary! I would say this to you; you have come this far. You have braved your first four years of college. That included putting yourself into a pool of people you most likely had not had contact with before. You put yourself through the grueling grad school application process. You got accepted! You started there with new people and inserted yourself into a clinic you had not worked in before (most likely :P). You can do this. 

If you pay attention, everything that happens to you is a form of instruction. As such, you have been instructed in new and scary scenarios before and come out better for it. Hold onto that! Own that and have confidence in Future You's abilities in this situation.

AdultChildren,ex2c4bl,t3_cr2vv6,1565966700.0,"Happy almost birthday. I am so sorry that want to celebrate this with your mom and cannot. 

I know that feeling well. I have not really had a full conversation with my own mother for about 17 years. She contacted me briefly fairly recently but, she is so far 'gone' that she is hardly recognizable. 

It DOES get better. Time and perspective made it easier for me. I conjured this perfect image of a mother I wanted- not the one that I have. The one that I wanted only appeared to me when I was a very small child and completely vanished by the time I was 8. The trouble with people (and with our perception of them) is that they often take on the attributes that we assign them or that were fleeting but that we held onto. When I realized that the person I glimpsed here and there was not a person who actually existed- it was someone I *wanted* to exist, I was better able to grieve and process the moving on bit. 

There is something so ineffably heart-wrenching about losing a parent. However we do it, to death, to addiction, to distance, it is like losing (to me) a part of the Self. We needed them to shelter, love, and teach us. We needed them to show us how to be in this world. And, for whatever reason, they could not.   

> six month ghost of stability to arrive back in my mom 

I think you know this but, when you experience your own stability, you will tend to think less and less of her's. You will comfort and ground yourself. That can be a very lonely feeling but it can also be empowering. Take solace in your inner strength. It takes a lot of grit to survive parental change/abandonment/betrayal. 

When you celebrate your birthday this weekend, you can flip your perspective. It can be about how you do not have your mother there or it can be about your accomplishments and about the people and meaningful relationships that you *do* have in your life. Birthdays are about just that; another year of accomplishments, another year of things to be grateful for, and another year of *you.* 

Much love and wellness."

It sounds like keeping your mother in your life is causing you a great amount of distress. I would say to do what is best for you but, in my personal experience, my life and mental wellness improved immensely when I started distancing myself from relationships (some family included) that were not good for me.

When the mind and body are not in alignment with how we truly feel and what we deeply value, it can be a difficult hurdle to maneuver.  

I see what you are getting at because most humans want deep, meaningful connections with others. Not everyone deserves to see that side of you though. Case in point, the people who show discomfort with your problems. They can not, for whatever reason, accept your problems and that is ok. Does it make either of you any less of a good person? No. Some people just cannot handle another person's 'stuff'. This does mean, however, that they do not deserve to know the more intimate parts of you. Tearing yourself apart to try and get at a deeper connection with someone is just going to hurt both of you. I applaud you for choosing to accept that those friendships can stay where they are- with healthy, firm boundaries in place.
