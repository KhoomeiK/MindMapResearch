AskReddit,fm0s2tt,t3_fs1zzs,1585665049.0,"""The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia""- by Reba McIntyre

I positively LOATHE modern country music but I absolutely love Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, etc. Well when I was 7 years old my mother bought two tickets for her & I to go see Reba McIntyre w/ openers Linda Davis (sings duet on ""Does He Love You?"" track w/ Reba) & Clint Black @ the Civic Center in Augusta, GA.

My mom was just as excited as I was to take me to my first concert! We had amazing seats right up front and in the middle section so I had a perfect view of everyone. When the song mentioned above began to be performed my mother, who had escaped  an abusive first marriage, began to cry while singing at the top her lungs. Even at that age I kind of understood the cathartic release my mother was having, and gave her the biggest hug I could muster. 

My mother passed away 7.5 years later. She lost her battle with depression and shot herself the first day of my sophomore year. I found her when I came home from school that day. Understandably the memories from that night with her at my first concert  are ones that I'll always treasure. And as much as I can't stand country music, I'll sing my heart out to Reba McIntyre any day of the week."

SuicideWatch,fjhnxak,t3_fd8tmk,1583351781.0,"Yes. I've felt this way since I was eight years old. Then I learned that my biological maternal grandfather committed suicide after returning from WWII. My mother, aunt, and uncle were all placed into adoption by my maternal grandmother and all three siblings were eventually adopted by the same family. When my mother was 39 she shot herself in the chest with a .22 rifle. It was the first day of my sophomore year of high school. That whole day I knew something was off and had even told my two best friends that I thought my mom was going to kill herself-- but they didn't believe me. And why would they have? My mother had been an elementary school teacher for a dozen years, was a Sunday School teacher at our local Southern Baptist Church, and worked as an insurance agent. There was NO WAY this woman would do such a thing! 

Only, she did. I came home to my parents' bedroom door being locked (they placed a deadbolt on the door to prevent my silbings and I from snooping for Xmas presents; we had been caught in the past.) I knocked, banged on the door, called out to her-- no response. So I turned on the hallway light, grabbed a flashlight, and hopped down onto the floor to look under the one inch gap underneath the bedroom door. I saw the light from the T.V. screen flashing as commercials played and then I spotted what originally looked like spilled ice tea on my parents dark brown carpet. I directed my flashlight towards the spill and immediately noticed the crimson color. My flashlight then found her nude body on the floor in between the table with her vanity and my parents' bathroom. There's still blood spatter on the mirror on the vanity table to this day; I refuse to clean it off. 

After discovering my mothers' body I panicked and ran to my room, frantically trying to put on my tennis shoes that I had kicked off as I entered my house. My father came home early and I stood there frozen as I heard him grumble about the hallway light being on and the bedroom door being locked. I heard his keys rattle as he opened the door-- and then a scream followed by a loud thud as my father fell to his knees. He must've pulled out his cellphone because in the next minute I heard him say, ""It's my wife. I think she shot herself."" followed by loud sobs. I frantically ran out the front door, in complete shock, and instead of making a right to go towards my best friends' house I went to the left. My childhood neighborhood, the only home I'd ever known and I couldn't remember what direction to go in. I turn around, correct my path, and begin to run to my best friends' place. I trip and fall twice, then as I reach her porch  I trip again and stumble as I'm running up her stairs. My bf and her mom hear the commotion and run outside to see me laying on her steps sobbing. My best friend ""C"" asks me what's wrong and I look at them and choke out, ""My mom's in Hell. She shot herself."" A look of shock springs to both of their faces and they carry me inside. The rest of the day is a blur, but I do remember having to call all of my siblings (all older, 1 brother and two sisters. Brother was at work, one sister was in grad school @ UNC Chapel Hill, and the oldest sister was married with two kids and working as a nurse; I called each of them to let them know what happened.) I also remember dealing with over twenty cop cars, two ambulances, and a fire truck being parked in my yard/on my street. The sheriff of my county arrived to speak to us because he was a friend of the family. Neighbors drove by extra slowly gawking at all of emergency vehicles and officers, EMT's, and firemen standing around our yard. It was most certainly a sight to see...

So do I feel like I'm destined to commit suicide? Well my maternal grandfather took a bath with a transistor radio that was still plugged in and my mother shot herself in the chest with a .22 that had buckshot. She bled to death because the bullets didn't penetrate her chest cavity. I've been a depressed kid since I was 5 years old and first thought of suicide when I was only 8 years old. Fuck yes I believe I'm destined to die by my own hand. At this point it's a family tradition...
