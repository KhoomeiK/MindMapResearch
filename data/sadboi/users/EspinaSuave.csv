insaneparents,fohv6ss,t3_g7e329,1587773269.0,"Wow OP. I‚Äôm so sorry. This is a novel of sheer INSANITY. In the first half, I was like ok at least he is acknowledging he is wrong, there‚Äôs a start. But, I realize if it was just an apology you wouldn‚Äôt have posted. Further reading, I honestly had my mouth open at the ‚Äúnew changes‚Äù he made. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around this at all. Not any part of it. Need your lap top and cords, and WiFi for online school since everyone is doing school from home due to a damn global pandemic? Not his problem. Hungry and missed dinner or something? Go buy your own food, but after I cut your allowance as well. As a parent, I lose my temper at times. It‚Äôs hard sometimes. But these posts reassure me that I‚Äôm not nearly as bad as I beat myself up for sometimes. I feel guilty over tiny things. This blows my mind. And your mother going along with this makes this doubly sad and insane. If I knew my husband was like this, and then knew this was the message he sent after the night before; like I can‚Äôt even see it happening. Hang in there OP. Try and stay with a friend maybe? Other family? Idk if there‚Äôs anyone you can reach out to but please stay safe and try and get out of there if you can. Best of luck to you <3"
AmItheAsshole,fohomdw,t3_g7c3t6,1587769626.0,"NTA. Your wife is beyond insensitive and lacking empathy for her own husband. I‚Äôve had kidney infections and was hospitalized for them for 2 weeks total; I had been discharged and readmitted. That isn‚Äôt any joke, never mind a ‚Äúman flu‚Äù. 

OP; my husband isn‚Äôt the best when sick, but also isn‚Äôt the worse. Sometimes I even if I think he doesn‚Äôt feel as bad as he is saying, I still take his feelings into consideration and validate him. At the end of the day, it isn‚Äôt me and I don‚Äôt know how he is feeling. If he felt he needed to see a doctor, I would NEVER discourage him. 

The fact that she isn‚Äôt even sorry and is letting you sleep in the basement says a lot. I don‚Äôt think a simple apology will solve this. If there hasn‚Äôt been any other red flags with her before, this is definitely a big one. 

If you feel up to it at some point, or that it would be somewhat effective (I don‚Äôt think so imo but this is also if you‚Äôre wanting to mend your relationship issues) to show her this thread and see the amount of people who think she‚Äôs absolutely TA. Good luck OP, feel better and stay safe. Listen to your instincts from here on out, especially regarding your health."

I understand the nagging you‚Äôre talking about. Because before I understood what he actually did (which was years ago) I wouldn‚Äôt have dinner ready and he would be upset and hungry while I just wanted to talk to him. 

I‚Äôve come to realize over the years, he works hard and is hungry. I want to spend time with him but it‚Äôs selfish for me to not understand he has been physically active all day doing hard manual labor. He‚Äôs understandably hungry. And no food for him to eat turns him into being hangry."

I have never posted any of this anywhere (only ever about past drug use) and your post helped me be able to rant too. But mainly to relate to you and let you know I really understand and know how hard it is. Also I‚Äôm sorry this is so long and I wasn‚Äôt trying to hijack your post!"
unpopularopinion,fj3h7ob,t1_fj2jnv9,1582983505.0,This made me so sad to read. I‚Äôm sorry. My kids have two Guinea pigs; we had one a few years ago but unfortunately he passed. My kids still miss our first one. I can‚Äôt imagine telling them this and having them bury their own pet alone too.
