Gunpla,fphk9ad,t1_fphjgtb,1588622754.0,"Yeah, Wing was my first series when I was a kid watching Toonami. I got back into the franchise around the time 00 and Unicorn were first releasing, so I'm all too familiar with the stink of SEED Destiny.  But, I wasn't sure if original SEED was still watchable or not. Probably gonna skip it though, since I've marathonned most of UC and don't need a retread. 

As for IBO, are there any older series you'd compare it to? I stayed away because it seemed like the franchise was getting really toy-commercially around then with Build Fighters and such."
