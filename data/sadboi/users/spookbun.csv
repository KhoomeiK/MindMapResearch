BUT REGARDLESS of the drama, I think its a really open platform - kinda reminding me of old youtube and myspace. Feels more like a playground and its way less restricted. Has really good vibes and i feel like I can just experiment more (especially with cannabis) on this platform. The community seems more open and accenting too!! I don't feel like I'm going to get drowned out as much as I would on YouTube."
