Wanting and desiring help is a great place to be. You know you want to improve your life and your connections. But don't take every bit of negative stimuli in your life as ""I need to change"". That's not always true.  


Focus on the dinner itself. Do you want to make it better? Where and why do you struggle with it? What makes it harder for YOU? Those are some great places to start thinking about this. But it comes from within. You can't say ""My girlfriend is mad I'm fucking up dinner, so I need to completely change who I am."""
