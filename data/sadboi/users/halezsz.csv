hognosesnakes,fr1pu60,t1_fr1ppf2,1589823904.0,"Well, maybe you still can and just wait a bit before you give it a go! Let us know how she’s doing down the toad. I hope you figure out something that helps."
hognosesnakes,fr1p353,t1_fr1ot96,1589823548.0,"Ah, sorry. I didn’t read that completely about the temp gradient and that’s good to know then about the 95!

hognosesnakes,fr1n8n4,t1_fr1mjw0,1589822650.0,"Hmm. Well, if she’s able to borrow/dig then that’s good at least, but I wonder still it it’s affecting the temperature then? Basing this only on my own research. Also I’m not sure if 93 is too high - my warm side for my girl when the lamp turns on gets to only about 85, but no more if I can monitor it properly. I don’t know whether 93 is good or bad, but I have never had it that warm myself. I just hate the thought of her playing dead so much. I know it must be stressing you out, as well. Do you have any reptile vets nearby that perhaps you could speak with? We actually got some pretty helpful tips from our vet regarding care alone and they seem a good deal knowledgeable, too, when it comes to the little worms."

hognosesnakes,fr1lo1j,t1_fr1edwe,1589821887.0,"That being said if she’s too stressed over the bedding she’s probably not using her hides properly, which could be causing stress because she can’t retreat anywhere. I have a similar log piece in mine and she will often hide under it. I have a cool side and a warm side. Ambient about the same, but I concentrate the heat on only the right side with a heat pad and a heat bulb that is set to come on at certain low ambient temperatures. On the cold side we have a rock cave beneath a fake plant. I applaud your use of real greenery, although I don’t know the pros and cons of that. I have all fake vines in my girls tank. Enough to give her some hiding spaces while she’s out in the open, too. 

I’d have to say I think my biggest worry for your girl though is that mulch. I’d switch that ASAP. I don’t know if this helps and maybe someone else will chime in! That’s just my opinion. I’ll try and attach a picture of my girls hide just to show you - you can see all of her tunnels, too."
hognosesnakes,fr1kz8a,t1_fr1edwe,1589821538.0,"So, firstly I am by no means an expert at this. I’ve had my girl since August. We’ve had a corn for almost two years now. Hogs are definitely different. There’s a ton of stuff I’ve learned about caring for snakes let alone hognose snakes just through reddit. The Sneks reddit alone was a huge help. There are a few things I’m curious about and my biggest concern is the substrate you’re using. Hognose are notorious for burrowing and tunneling. I use aspen bedding for my girl about 5 inches deep and she has tunnels like you wouldn’t believe. This cypress mulch doesn’t look like a good fit for a hog, IMO. Some aspen chips are still fine because they can still hide well, but large mulch like that can really affect humidity in the enclosure and may be too rough for her to dig through - which is why I’m assuming she’s curled up in that bowl/dish. Also, I’m not sure but are those measurements for a 20 gallon? Sometimes when they’re young it an enclosure is too big it can become stressful, my girl is still in her 10 gallon."

hognosesnakes,fph6m3e,t1_fph64kh,1588615880.0,Really?! So it’s okay to handle them at that point just for a little assistance? I’ve done a little soak with her after the shotty shed to help get off pieces I could see. And I spray her bedding down usually after she’s gone into blue. She’s had two sheds with me since I got her last August! I’ll give that a try for her next one.

So, for the last month (maybe more at this point, I don’t know) I have had these 5 pimple spots in my chin area. They’re just beneath the surface. They don’t come to a head. They don’t go away. It’s driving me NUTS. I’ve never really had issues with my skin. And now this! I’m supposed to be getting married this year and I’ve never had this before. I’ve been trying overnight spot treatments, facial peels AHA/BHA. I don’t understand why they won’t go away. I don’t think warm compress brings them up enough for me to try anything with.

AlAnon,fnbj4al,t3_g0kglo,1586816440.0,"Hello,

I’m a 27F with a 52 year old mother who is neck deep in her bad choices right now. 

I live with my fiancé. I have a stable job and I’m a nursing student. I’m trying to build a life. And in the midst of it all, from afar, I’m watching my mother spiral deeper and deeper into the darkest hole I’ve ever seen first hand. 

Her drinking is insufferable, her lack of interest in getting better is even more so.

I spent most of the weekend asleep after hours of crying. For the first time since all of this, this weekend she chose to cast me out as one of the daemons in her life. The same way she’s done with everyone who’s ever tried to help her. It broke me. The hateful and hurtful things she said just pushed me further into my own poor mental state. I can’t take her hurt. I’ve tried to help in the ways that I can from where I am - the ways that would matter long term. The ways that would make a difference for her.

Now I’m afraid she’s into drugs, too, but I can’t bare the thought of that. I just hope. “Hope is the conduit of miracles.” That’s my mantra. I can’t do anything more for her. She won’t take the steps to make things right for herself. 

The trouble is, when they do this they aren’t just ruining themselves - they’re taking a part of us with them. The daughters who crave a healthy mother, a healthy relationship, someone to turn to in times such as these.

I’ve been on this subreddit here and there and so many people are so helpful. I haven’t brought myself to a meeting, yet. Right now this is just what I need and can handle. 

You ARE NOT alone. Wherever you are. I feel your pain. I understand your emotional frustration with the situation and even with yourself... The part where you think you’re the one in the wrong or you’re somehow responsible. You have to remind yourself that you’re not. You can love this woman who is your mother. And just pray she’ll find her way back to a healthy wholesome life.

I’m always here if you want to talk."
Hognose,fn7p049,t1_fn7orp5,1586724729.0,Your advice is all right in line with how it all unfolded! She was still in shed - I found it beneath her bedding as I suspected.

hognosesnakes,fn0ud7j,t1_fn0io99,1586548912.0,"Excellent advice about the handling. We got Lola in August 2019 as a baby! It was her, an axanthic, and conda. She just stayed curled in my palm. Fell in love. Saw her three days in a row and then bought her. I actually haven’t weighed her, but just got my hands on a scale. She has been eating pinkies by themselves since before I got her (she’s on fuzzies now) I will usually handle her once a week, if not twice and don’t get much attitude. I always handle her at least once a week because I’ll take her out of her enclosure and feed her elsewhere. Sometimes I’ll take her out and let her slither around on a large blanket. She’s only ever hissed/bluffed at me once and it was recent, because I didn’t know she was in shed. When she does I leave her alone. She’s a good girl so far, otherwise! Much more fun than our corn, who just wants to eat all of the foods and escape. 😂"

I know this isn’t the appropriate opinion to verbalize, but it’s an ever-present feeling, none the less. I am still wary of having her there if she continues down this path, though. I know she loves me I really do, but she doesn’t care about herself anymore and to have been a mother I’ve spent my life loving and becoming my best friend as I’ve grown, to now be this.. it’s just so much harder to not want to say those mean things. Even though I know it’s unproductive. I also usually don’t have these tough conversations, because I fear it will worsen her mental state if she knows how upset I am. I just pretend along the way, but it’s hurting me, too, at this point."

I think typically the ceremony is more intimate and where you would only invite those closest to you, but the reception is what costs money. But I think you literally meant after party because I hear that’s a thing after weddings."

relationship_advice,fj6oj9z,t3_fbhfhi,1583076756.0,"As someone who is getting married and having to work our budget super closely, I can speak in favor of money problems. If we had 4 groomsmen and we knew two of their partners and not the other two I would feel inclined to invite the two we know, but not inclined to invite the other two. I know it’s a shame to think this way, but financially it’s been an important concept. We are having a small wedding and the guest list is definitely the hardest part! When money is not an issue it’s customary to invite the partners or plus ones no matter what so it’s hard to be this way. We haven’t finalized our guest list, yet, and I dread it. 

I do think that since they’ve said to you multiple times that you’d be invited that’s a bit wrong on their part. I’ve had old friends/acquaintances that talk of our wedding that I’m not very close with anymore and I make sure not to say anything about being invited or not, because I just don’t know how it’ll work out. 

I would just weigh all possibilities for yourself and so that you can feel a little better. Unfortunately, I don’t know if I have any advise beyond just focusing on not letting it upset you too much. 😔"

You understand that he is 16 and has friendships and desires a sense of independence and privacy, but it is your place and your things. He can have company but under your conditions and he is old enough to respect that. You don’t know his friends and you can most certainly set limitations."

weddingplanning,ff6i9nj,t3_erxwk6,1579627781.0,"As a bride with 6 girls and understanding the financial constraints of planning and being in a wedding, I would say absolutely have this conversation with her.

I check in with my girls regularly and ask if they’re all still okay to be in it and that I would not be offended if it became to much. They know that they are bridesmaids because they are important to me and if something didn’t work out I would not hold that against them. 

I would just ask to chat with her and be upfront and honest about all that you’re dealing with. If she were to fault you for anything that would be her wrong doing. 

Good luck! Don’t stress!"
