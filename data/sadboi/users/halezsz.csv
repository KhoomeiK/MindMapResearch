hognosesnakes,fr343aq,t1_fr32gko,1589849538.0,Omg! I‚Äôm not color blind at it takes me forever to find her myself.
hognosesnakes,fr1pu60,t1_fr1ppf2,1589823904.0,"Well, maybe you still can and just wait a bit before you give it a go! Let us know how she‚Äôs doing down the toad. I hope you figure out something that helps."
hognosesnakes,fr1p353,t1_fr1ot96,1589823548.0,"Ah, sorry. I didn‚Äôt read that completely about the temp gradient and that‚Äôs good to know then about the 95!

hognosesnakes,fr1n8n4,t1_fr1mjw0,1589822650.0,"Hmm. Well, if she‚Äôs able to borrow/dig then that‚Äôs good at least, but I wonder still it it‚Äôs affecting the temperature then? Basing this only on my own research. Also I‚Äôm not sure if 93 is too high - my warm side for my girl when the lamp turns on gets to only about 85, but no more if I can monitor it properly. I don‚Äôt know whether 93 is good or bad, but I have never had it that warm myself. I just hate the thought of her playing dead so much. I know it must be stressing you out, as well. Do you have any reptile vets nearby that perhaps you could speak with? We actually got some pretty helpful tips from our vet regarding care alone and they seem a good deal knowledgeable, too, when it comes to the little worms."

hognosesnakes,fr1lo1j,t1_fr1edwe,1589821887.0,"That being said if she‚Äôs too stressed over the bedding she‚Äôs probably not using her hides properly, which could be causing stress because she can‚Äôt retreat anywhere. I have a similar log piece in mine and she will often hide under it. I have a cool side and a warm side. Ambient about the same, but I concentrate the heat on only the right side with a heat pad and a heat bulb that is set to come on at certain low ambient temperatures. On the cold side we have a rock cave beneath a fake plant. I applaud your use of real greenery, although I don‚Äôt know the pros and cons of that. I have all fake vines in my girls tank. Enough to give her some hiding spaces while she‚Äôs out in the open, too. 

I‚Äôd have to say I think my biggest worry for your girl though is that mulch. I‚Äôd switch that ASAP. I don‚Äôt know if this helps and maybe someone else will chime in! That‚Äôs just my opinion. I‚Äôll try and attach a picture of my girls hide just to show you - you can see all of her tunnels, too."
hognosesnakes,fr1kz8a,t1_fr1edwe,1589821538.0,"So, firstly I am by no means an expert at this. I‚Äôve had my girl since August. We‚Äôve had a corn for almost two years now. Hogs are definitely different. There‚Äôs a ton of stuff I‚Äôve learned about caring for snakes let alone hognose snakes just through reddit. The Sneks reddit alone was a huge help. There are a few things I‚Äôm curious about and my biggest concern is the substrate you‚Äôre using. Hognose are notorious for burrowing and tunneling. I use aspen bedding for my girl about 5 inches deep and she has tunnels like you wouldn‚Äôt believe. This cypress mulch doesn‚Äôt look like a good fit for a hog, IMO. Some aspen chips are still fine because they can still hide well, but large mulch like that can really affect humidity in the enclosure and may be too rough for her to dig through - which is why I‚Äôm assuming she‚Äôs curled up in that bowl/dish. Also, I‚Äôm not sure but are those measurements for a 20 gallon? Sometimes when they‚Äôre young it an enclosure is too big it can become stressful, my girl is still in her 10 gallon."

AlAnon,fnbj4al,t3_g0kglo,1586816440.0,"Hello,

I‚Äôm a 27F with a 52 year old mother who is neck deep in her bad choices right now. 

I live with my fianc√©. I have a stable job and I‚Äôm a nursing student. I‚Äôm trying to build a life. And in the midst of it all, from afar, I‚Äôm watching my mother spiral deeper and deeper into the darkest hole I‚Äôve ever seen first hand. 

Her drinking is insufferable, her lack of interest in getting better is even more so.

I spent most of the weekend asleep after hours of crying. For the first time since all of this, this weekend she chose to cast me out as one of the daemons in her life. The same way she‚Äôs done with everyone who‚Äôs ever tried to help her. It broke me. The hateful and hurtful things she said just pushed me further into my own poor mental state. I can‚Äôt take her hurt. I‚Äôve tried to help in the ways that I can from where I am - the ways that would matter long term. The ways that would make a difference for her.

Now I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôs into drugs, too, but I can‚Äôt bare the thought of that. I just hope. ‚ÄúHope is the conduit of miracles.‚Äù That‚Äôs my mantra. I can‚Äôt do anything more for her. She won‚Äôt take the steps to make things right for herself. 

The trouble is, when they do this they aren‚Äôt just ruining themselves - they‚Äôre taking a part of us with them. The daughters who crave a healthy mother, a healthy relationship, someone to turn to in times such as these.

I‚Äôve been on this subreddit here and there and so many people are so helpful. I haven‚Äôt brought myself to a meeting, yet. Right now this is just what I need and can handle. 

You ARE NOT alone. Wherever you are. I feel your pain. I understand your emotional frustration with the situation and even with yourself... The part where you think you‚Äôre the one in the wrong or you‚Äôre somehow responsible. You have to remind yourself that you‚Äôre not. You can love this woman who is your mother. And just pray she‚Äôll find her way back to a healthy wholesome life.

I‚Äôm always here if you want to talk."

Fell in love. Saw her three days in a row and then bought her. I actually haven‚Äôt weighed her, but just got my hands on a scale. She has been eating pinkies by themselves since before I got her (she‚Äôs on fuzzies now) I will usually handle her once a week, if not twice and don‚Äôt get much attitude. I always handle her at least once a week because I‚Äôll take her out of her enclosure and feed her elsewhere. Sometimes I‚Äôll take her out and let her slither around on a large blanket. She‚Äôs only ever hissed/bluffed at me once and it was recent, because I didn‚Äôt know she was in shed. When she does I leave her alone. She‚Äôs a good girl so far, otherwise!

I know she loves me I really do, but she doesn‚Äôt care about herself anymore and to have been a mother I‚Äôve spent my life loving and becoming my best friend as I‚Äôve grown, to now be this.. it‚Äôs just so much harder to not want to say those mean things.

relationship_advice,fj782ab,t1_fj6tuno,1583087808.0,"I‚Äôve noticed a few comments about ceremony vs. wedding. I think typically the ceremony is more intimate and where you would only invite those closest to you, but the reception is what costs money. But I think you literally meant after party because I hear that‚Äôs a thing after weddings."
relationship_advice,fj77j2p,t1_fj6tuno,1583087649.0,That‚Äôs not to say that you aren‚Äôt allowed to feel disappointed!
relationship_advice,fj6oj9z,t3_fbhfhi,1583076756.0,"As someone who is getting married and having to work our budget super closely, I can speak in favor of money problems. If we had 4 groomsmen and we knew two of their partners and not the other two I would feel inclined to invite the two we know, but not inclined to invite the other two. I know it‚Äôs a shame to think this way, but financially it‚Äôs been an important concept. We are having a small wedding and the guest list is definitely the hardest part! When money is not an issue it‚Äôs customary to invite the partners or plus ones no matter what so it‚Äôs hard to be this way. We haven‚Äôt finalized our guest list, yet, and I dread it. 

I do think that since they‚Äôve said to you multiple times that you‚Äôd be invited that‚Äôs a bit wrong on their part. I‚Äôve had old friends/acquaintances that talk of our wedding that I‚Äôm not very close with anymore and I make sure not to say anything about being invited or not, because I just don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôll work out. 

I would just weigh all possibilities for yourself and so that you can feel a little better. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt know if I have any advise beyond just focusing on not letting it upset you too much. üòî"

You understand that he is 16 and has friendships and desires a sense of independence and privacy, but it is your place and your things. He can have company but under your conditions and he is old enough to respect that. You don‚Äôt know his friends and you can most certainly set limitations."

weddingplanning,ff6i9nj,t3_erxwk6,1579627781.0,"As a bride with 6 girls and understanding the financial constraints of planning and being in a wedding, I would say absolutely have this conversation with her.

I check in with my girls regularly and ask if they‚Äôre all still okay to be in it and that I would not be offended if it became to much. They know that they are bridesmaids because they are important to me and if something didn‚Äôt work out I would not hold that against them. 

I would just ask to chat with her and be upfront and honest about all that you‚Äôre dealing with. If she were to fault you for anything that would be her wrong doing. 

Good luck! Don‚Äôt stress!"
