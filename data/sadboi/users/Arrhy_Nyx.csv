interestingasfuck,flzuzoi,t1_flyomuy,1585634414.0,"It’s due to the RH factor! If you have an Rh negative blood type but your partner has a positive blood type, you may be at risk for something called Rh incompatibility. This occurs if your body detects the presence of the Rh protein from your baby's red blood cells. Because you do not possess this protein, your body may create antibodies to attack this protein, which your body thinks is a foreign substance. While this isn't always a problem, it can pose a serious risk to the health of your baby. If you and your baby have incompatible blood types, doctors will use something called a RhoGAM shot to protect your baby from any antibodies.

Your mom was given the RhoGAM injection to protect herself and you."
