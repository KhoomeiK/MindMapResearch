The job market is extremely difficult, and a lot will depend on the type of training and skills you acquire that you may or may not pick up in classes (Emu or Pastperfect, ArcGIS, museum studies, non profit management, ethnography). 
You can always minor in anthropology and continue as a STEM major if you have a talent for it. I would have saved myself a love of uncertainty if I had been able to pursue a STEM degree (dyscalia killed the math part for me). I love archaeology and the opportunities I’ve had but I’m going to go back for a third degree. Haven’t had much success trying to alt ac.
