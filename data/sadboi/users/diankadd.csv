depression,fpojae6,t3_gea6mo,1588785446.0,This felt hard. Because my life's the same.
amiugly,fpg1p88,t1_fpg18j7,1588591468.0,"Well, I don't really post on Instagram or other social platforms, so I wouldn't say that I focus on compliments on the internet. I don't always see only the negatives about me, there are days when I like the way I look, things I appreciate about myself, but female body truly is a very complicated complex of many factors lol 
And sometimes the negative side just overwhelms."
amiugly,fpdhe4v,t3_gcscp1,1588527028.0,"I'm not here to answer this question, because I don't know the answer. But I once posted here because there are days in my life when I really hate the way I look. I wanted to hear honest opinions from strangers, not meaningless compliments or whatsoever, just honesty. 
I wanted to know how people see me, because I'm often disgusted with what I see when I look in the mirror. Everyone here basically told me that I'm just seeking attention. And that really hurt.
Literally everyone has insecurities. Even the prettier, even the less. There are thousands of beautiful girls out there, who cry themselves to sleep every night because they don't look like some models on Instagram, because they're worried no-one will ever like them, and sadly, I'm one of those girls. And it really doesn't help if guys here shut them down by telling them they're just posting for attention. Because trust me, they're not."

relationship_advice,fb81yxv,t1_fb81q8w,1576604385.0,It's exactly this beautiful time full of joy and love I don't wanna destroy with dealing with a break up :(
relationship_advice,fb7u3yg,t1_fb7tdg4,1576599419.0,"Thank you very much, I unfortunately have to admit that I've been willing to break up many times, but in the end, I couldn't bring myself to do it...."
relationship_advice,fb7segn,t1_fb7s8g1,1576598292.0,We're spending Christmas both separately with our families.
relationship_advice,fb7scs9,t1_fb7s3tn,1576598262.0,"Yes, he's spending the holidays with family but he'll have a very hard start of the year because of his university exams, so I also don't want him to be stressed and depressed so he won't be able to focus on his studies.  This is just a very bad timing."
relationship_advice,far3zf5,t1_far3h3z,1576311912.0,"That's the point, there's no chemistry between us and I feel like we're very distant from each other. My boyfriend still loves me very much, but I can't give him what he wants, not now. I probably don't love him anymore, or at least not that much. And A...I might really like him. I like his personality, his smile, everything. I just don't know what should I do."

relationship_advice,f6pw78b,t1_f6pvpb5,1573065614.0,"Yes, I understand, what I meant was that we basically look at each other every day, so I doubt he will get this move. But thank you anyway for your advice! :)"
relationship_advice,f6pvbpt,t1_f6prn81,1573065068.0,"Well but what if he doesn't get it that I like him? I know that this sounds pretty childish, but I swear to god I have veritable reasons why I can't make the first move."

amiugly,ezl941j,t3_d1dpsv,1567973760.0,"""As a woman"" I have to disagree. The first impression is definitely about how the other person looks and if you are attracted to them. I would say that's very natural and normal. That's what matters to you at first. Kindness, charm, and helpfulness, etc. are very important in a relationship and it's for sure something that women appreciate. But we can't really say that it's something that makes your first impression. Physical attraction is absolutely natural, though when u get to know somebody, it sometimes doesn't matter anymore, in this case, it's when those qualities are appreciated."
OUTFITS,ezl3kuu,t3_d1devg,1567971350.0,"It's normal I would say. It's definitely not anything special, just a regular jacket."
relationship_advice,ezkv76r,t1_ezkuqoq,1567967113.0,"Yea, I know. That's the truth. I'm just so stupid that I can't move on and I'm afraid that I'll get back to him, as always."
relationship_advice,ezkufw7,t1_ezku5is,1567966744.0,"I know, but that's exactly the problem. I thought I would be relieved, but I just miss him already."

amipregnant,eyl2895,t1_eyl25xr,1567174417.0,Even if it was only 9 days after?
depressed,eyj3ock,t1_eyj1zq2,1567112015.0,"For the third time today, thank you, genuinely thank you. This means so much to me. You must be a very kind person that you spend so much time writing me these thoughtful words. I'll definitely take your advice and give myself some space to work this out."
depressed,eyics4m,t1_eyia73k,1567100613.0,"Thank you very much for sharing your story with me. I'm not gonna lie, even if you didn't mean to scare me, you did. I think I'll try the break and see what comes from it. I'm just very confused, since this is my first, and I'm afraid of staying with the first person that comes, because you never know how the others would treat you. But I'm afraid that if we break up, nobody will love me the way he did and I will never ever be happy. This is just so hard. I can't keep dealing with it anymore."
depressed,eyg6cx9,t1_eyg64oj,1567062444.0,"I know I should, I'm just terrified of losing my only close friend."
depressed,eyg5pso,t1_eye8z3t,1567062039.0,"Yes, and he has almost everything I'm looking for in a partner. Even if it sounds terrible, somehow that isn't enough for me. Since this is my first relationship, I feel like I want to try something else,with someone else, because that's right. I just don't wanna lose him."
depressed,eyg5f6p,t1_eyfgjcx,1567061856.0,"I don't have feelings for anybody else at the moment. But, though Ik it's not fair, I feel that I'm open up to other relationship. Like I wouldn't mind if someone flirted with me, and I can tell that it seems like I'm just waiting for someone to come around, if you know what I mean. I have more interest in men than when I was in love."

depressed,eydzx5n,t1_eydz4nj,1567026923.0,"That's the point-I don't exactly know. I guess it's just stereotype, but sadly he's not the one who can change that. We've tried many times, but it didn't work for me."
