You can find a therapist for free via Military One Source or you can seek out the Chaplain on base. Separating work from home is a very common thing that happens so, OP, please please please don’t take it personally. You’re still the beautiful and ridiculously attractive woman your husband married.

USMilitarySO,flmyjcp,t1_flmvum4,1585302075.0,"15 digit microchip, 2 rabies vaccines (31+ days apart), and FAVN blood test? Make sure you have the original (wet signed in blue ink) copies of both of your rabies certificates and the microchip number is on both of them. Also, make sure you have the original copy of the FAVN results. Then you have a 180 day in home quarantine before they can be in country unless y’all live on base, then you can finish your quarantine in country. Japan is nice like that, lol. Even *if* you get on the rotator (very limited spaces for animals so book your spot the second you can) you still need to submit the paper work for the 40 day heads up. Although they aren’t always there, there’s supposed to be Japanese quarantine officials even on base to clear your animals upon arrival. I’m seriously not trying to sound like a jerk or make you panic but Japan can be real dickheads about animals entering the country. Can’t really blame them, though, bc they’re an island and rabies free and wanna keep it that way. lol I work at the vet clinic on a military base so I’m very very familiar with getting animals overseas.

Answers. Banks isn’t overproof. Pineapple juice wasn’t fresh bc I was drinking and being lazy and just wanted to take a swing at something. It was sweet and I actually did end up squeezing a half lime into it after the fact. I’m a novice to tiki drinks but the lesser rum content was intentional bc I was already drinking.

SPCA’s are usually helpful for this. Did you ask if they’ll accept payments? Care Credit can get you in trouble but if you’ve already crowd sourced over $600 in just a couple of days you should be able to gather all the funds to pay off the balance within 6 months. I know this would be heartbreaking but some shelters will cover the cost of treatment if you surrender the pet to them. It’s a better option than euthanasia, though.
