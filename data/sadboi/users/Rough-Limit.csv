depression,fbr4bze,t3_ee58qm,1577038994.0,"My mom had done the same . I had terrible depression and anxiety in high school . 
One time I was about 16 or 17 I told her I was depressed and she chuckled and said “You don’t have shit to be depressed about !” “Do you have any bills to pay ?, raising kids by yourself ? You don’t even know what depressed is ! “
Then she called my aunties and talked about it . All I could do was cry more"
depression,fa2qf7u,t1_f9xbdbz,1575785329.0,"I’ve been struggling with depression for many years . I’m 24. I didn’t realize I’ve had this struggle until I was 17 and I’ve looked back over past episodes. 
My family didn’t take depression and anxiety seriously. Although my grandmother had it badly in her younger years , even now . She had to take medication such as Prozac 
My mother has always suffered from the same thing . She’s always been indenial 
Anywho,
I know how it feels to want to just go away . 
I’m just tired . Completely tired ! 
It’s Like constant mental warfare
I just want a break 
I don’t want to just leave without hurting anybody 
I’m disappointed when I wake up in the mornings and I feel so ungrateful for it 
I’m just tired and I’ve been tired for sooo long 
I have a boyfriend but I’m still lonely 
Isn’t that mad ! ?
To have a partner and still feel alone?
He’s the tough type. Although we’ve been together for 6 years, he still has the 
“Straighten up and shrug it off “ attitude 
I don’t think he will ever understand my battle.
A couple years I expressed to him my thoughts of wanting to just give up on life and he called me idiotic and crazy and all sorts of things which made me feel way worse 
I think that’s what makes my depression worse is having someone and still be lonely  and have that emptyness ."
