depression,epoty0a,t3_bvcaeo,1559353472.0,"Wow. I share this same feeling and it destroys me.    
    
    
Never had a girl care about me or want to hang out with before until recently. She's the most care-free and spirited girl I've ever met and whatever situation I was in, she was there for me. I always told her that she doesn't have to help me because I didn't want to burden her or bring my problems into her life, but she insists and gave me her full support every step of the way.    
    
    
I plan to move back to my home state and be room mates with her, but I also need to remember that we are just good friends. Let whatever feelings me and her have towards each other come naturally and never forced.    
    
    
Love comes in many forms. Love them based on your relationship with that person. Love them as a friend, and in time, love them as a boyfriend/girlfriend."

I needed to hear this today. Thank you! <3"
