And I’m glad you’re enjoying Sekiro. Beating the final boss of Sekiro was truly the most exciting moment in gaming I’ve ever experienced. And each time I go back it’s still just as exciting. 

Good luck Shinobi"
Trophies,fr1ois1,t1_fr0yafn,1589823276.0,"Control is my favorite game ever since I played it a few months ago. I got the Platinum a while ago, and just last week I started playing it again and got 100% on the first DLC. Can’t wait for DLC #2! 

Good job on getting 200 Platinum trophies, that’s no small feat! 

Also, I saw in another comment you’re going for the Dark Souls games, plus BB and Sekiro. Good luck on those! They’re challenging but enjoyable, DS3 and Sekiro are two of my favorite games."
