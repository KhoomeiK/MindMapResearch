The plant is about 12 years old. Last year it lost a lot of its leaves, so it looks kinda leggy now. 

I’ve started noticing this strange brown-ish pigment on the back of some leaves. It’s not on the surface of the leaf; it seems like it’s some discoloration coming from the inside. The affected leaves curl up and harden up a little bit. Some of the newest growth is affected as well. 

The plant is located near a SE window. Plastic planter, drainage hole+drainage layer. Watered once the soil dries thoroughly (every ~2 weeks, given the size of the planter). Repotted about a month ago, but the leaves issue was already present.

agreed with the other comment, there’s no reason to panic. therapeutic effects can be observed within 0.6 - 1.0 concentration. it’s not recommended to go over 1.0, as intoxication starts at 1.2 concentration. 

if you’re just starting - monitor your lithium levels monthly for the first few months; once you learn how your body metabolizes lithium, you can start doing the blood testing every 2-3 months. also, you can do kidney function panel twice a year. 

don’t change your diet, esp water, salt and caffeine intake. lithium may drop if you move to a warmer climate (bc sweat).
