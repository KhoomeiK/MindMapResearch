agreed with the other comment, there‚Äôs no reason to panic. therapeutic effects can be observed within 0.6 - 1.0 concentration. it‚Äôs not recommended to go over 1.0, as intoxication starts at 1.2 concentration. 

if you‚Äôre just starting - monitor your lithium levels monthly for the first few months; once you learn how your body metabolizes lithium, you can start doing the blood testing every 2-3 months. also, you can do kidney function panel twice a year. 

don‚Äôt change your diet, esp water, salt and caffeine intake. lithium may drop if you move to a warmer climate (bc sweat).
