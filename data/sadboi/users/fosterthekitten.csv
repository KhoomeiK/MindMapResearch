depression,fqe3i8j,t3_gicynu,1589301154.0,"My dad tells me to wake up early every morning. Structure will make it better. 

He’s not wrong, but the reason I cant get out of my bed is my depression....."
depression,fqd8u3e,t3_gi8fpe,1589283501.0,"Do you still like making music?
If not, let yourself move on. You don’t have to like something forever."
depression,fqciykn,t3_ghsgx8,1589259433.0,And people tell us why aren’t you doing anything to get “better”?? Because it’s really fucking hard??? Like literally going to the kitchen to get some water feels like a daunting task.
depression,fqcemnk,t3_ghyn78,1589256329.0,"I feel you; I’m not sad but I’ve been sleeping a lot more lately and I don’t wven want to do anything fun (e.g. play games) 
I kinda just wait around until the day is over.... and repeat"
loseit,fppppk7,t3_gerbwg,1588806763.0,"I think sometimes it’s just as hard to gain weight as it is to lose. 
Well, your weight may fluctuate depending on how much water your body is holding onto, but unless you’re eating a ton everyday (and therefore over your maintenance) you probably wont gain that much weight."
Mindfulness,fpo9oxo,t3_gejefz,1588780794.0,"If she really cared about you as a human being she wouldn’t have done that imo. Of course, I’m not her and don’t know what was on her mind. And you said she sounded depressed so maybe she just needed someone to talk to; nothing more, nothing less. But if she did care about you she wouldn’t have called. She probably knew that would just confuse you and hurt you in the end. It’s kinda cruel if you think about it. (I’m not saying she had bad intentions; nobody always behaves logically, and especially not when they’re drunk.) 

I also have problems with thoughts that I do not want to think about; and honestly trying not to think about it just makes it worse. And keeping yourself busy with other things doesn’t always make it better, because you’re avoiding it. 

There’s this book (Get Out Of Your Mind And Into Your Life) Ive been reading. It’s supposed to help you be less consumed by your thoughts, just observing them and letting them pass by. It might help, it might not help at all, but I’m learning some useful strategies and I hope it could help you too."
