When I got fired from my first legit job after college, my mom said ""I told you so"" about moving out and how its my fault blah blah...I resent it and have been NC for almost 3 years now."

Good luck."

No strangers online can you give you the permission to do something you need to do. If you need to do it, then you go for it. No one else can do anything for you. It sounds like your workplace has sought to control their employees through fear. 

Network. LinkedIn. Pump your network for support. Find temporary work to hold you through until you land the job you want. You may need to let go of the idea that you will be unemployable if you left your job. Thats all anecdotal and not always true. You need to be secure enough to accept that you just need to survive right now, and taking a lower job as a transition may be needed. However, I don't know the economic situation in your country. 

This place sounds like a horrible institution. I'd lie. Time to be selfish. Its better to ask for forgiveness than permission. 

Terrible work sites get what they give off. If they can't be human enough or considerate, then neither are you. Its a risk you need to take. 

This place sounds like a sweatshop. Can you go to school instead?  

Anyways, FWIW"
