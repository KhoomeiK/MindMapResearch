depression,fp4bxgz,t1_fp4861b,1588295798.0,"Hey I totally get it I was kind of in the same situation as you are right now. One of the most typical ways depression takes over is through isolation. Your friend is isolating herself from her friends, family and loved ones, she’s fallen into this dark hole and believes she is all alone in it. It’s really a tricky situation because honestly who would know what to do?! But what I can tell you is that isolation only makes the depression worse. So what I would suggest is that you keep expressing your worried feelings to her, and let her know that you can’t fix all her problems but you can listen to them, be compassionate and nonjudgmental. I’ve also experienced similar feelings and depression truly tricks you’re brain into thinking you are NOT wanted that you’re a burden and that nobody cares about you. What I would do is continue to reach out because even expressing your worried about her and that you are about her is powerful. 

Also never forget that: you HAVE to set BOUNDARIES for yourself. I can tell that you are a very empathetic and understanding friend, and it’s mostly a good thing but can also be very draining too. Sometimes people can take on other peoples feelings and that is really not good and a situation you want to avoid!! Just remember that you are NEVER responsible for your friend or their behaviors. I hope this helps you and ur friend. Wishing you the best!! :)"
depression,fp47ygi,t3_gb83hk,1588293500.0,"Just keep asking because she’s not okay, or you could just call her a lot as a distraction if she doesn’t want to talk about it because it’ll help her, depression tricks people into thinking nobody cares about you"
unpopularopinion,foxwsts,t1_foxvpq3,1588158943.0,"Hey I apologize if I hurt you with my words. My point did come across quite aggressively, and I shouldn’t have reacted with anger. And Your feelings are totally valid, and you shouldn’t have to prove yourself to someone who doesn’t believe you. Rationally speaking depression is such a complex illness, it looks different for everyone and most importantly there are so many different types of depression. I don’t want to measure out anyone’s “level” of depression, because it’s as if you’re being invalidated. But I guess as someone who was on the edge of ending their life it feels like it’s the only choice you have. And people will say “think of your family” but it’s so ironic because you have thought of your family, your friends, loved ones, in fact you’re always thinking of them before yourself. Depression plays with your brain, when you’re living in utter misery every single day plagued by the thoughts of ending your life, suicide is the only option you have. Anyways I don’t advocate for suicide but I think as a community we must acknowledge that people who are suffering from these thoughts are Extremely strong and have highly self preservation all instincts. Anyways I’m sorry for coming at you like that I should’ve thought before I clicked post and I hope I gave you some perspective about this controversial topic."
unpopularopinion,foxuw5d,t1_foxug27,1588157106.0,"Have you gone to a psychiatrist or psychologist? Have you received treatment such as therapy or medication? Depression is not something anyone can snap out of, it’s an ILLNESS and it will get worse if untreated. You can’t just “snap out” of depression. According to statistic only 1/10 people deal with deals with severe depression at some point in their lives. But everyone in their life time will experience a “depressed mood”, which is literally not the same thing. You can get over a depressed mood but you can’t just “get over” depression."
unpopularopinion,foxubmv,t1_foxt5wc,1588156550.0,"I’m sorry but you’ve obviously never suffered from any form of depression. It frustrates me that people are STILL so uneducated about mental health because it is literally 2020. Mental illness is not a fucking joke. It’s literally a ILLNESS and needs to be treated as such. Do you think people WANT to be depressed or MAKE themselves that way. There’s a lot of science behind depression just like any other physical illness. And it’s not just feeling sad all the time, there is a stark difference from being sad and depressed. And it usually lasts for longer than two weeks or months and lots of times years. As someone who suffers from clinical depression your words are extremely triggering because if I’m honest it’s people like you that encourage those who are suffering to essentially kill themselves. Depression is an IMBALANCE OF CHEMICALS in ones brain. It is literally something inside you can’t change. It’s not anyone’s fault that their brain isn’t working properly. I mean why do you think antidepressants are prescribed. An illness needs treatment. I hope next time you write these thoughtless opinions you educate yourself on the cold hard facts."
unpopularopinion,foxtfay,t3_ga6tvb,1588155669.0,"I totally agree with 100%. You summarized this perfectly. As someone who has suffered from severe suicidal thoughts, it’s so annoying when others say “suicide is an easy way out”. And I couldn’t agree more, and I definitely don’t advocate for suicide but I just feel that people shouldn’t continue to misinterpret those who have passed and the very serious effects of mental illness."

Before covid seeing ppl post on their social media about the fun things they were doing really made me sad. Because I would always be at home alone, doing nothing in particular, because no one invites me anywhere and I’m not really the type to make plans. This particularly made my depression very bad. I’m trying to get better but it’s so hard and I just feel like I don’t even care anymore. Honestly I don’t even understand the point of life"

With this whole quarantine situation I’m falling back into the hole I was once in. I just don’t understand why I’m like this. My restrictive behaviours always get triggered when I’m at home for long periods of time, and with school online I feel as though I have too much control over my eating behaviours. And I feel as though my family doesn’t understand either, they’ll just be like just eat, it’s not that hard. I hope I can overcome this :("

But about your medication, I was actually first on that dosage prescribed by a family physician when I started Zoloft, and honestly it sucked! I felt no difference, still hopeless and suicidal, so after a month I hopped onto 75mg and again that barely made an improvement too. So I decided to meet with a psychiatrist who really helped me understand SSRI's, in short, my 75mg of Zoloft was considered a very low dosage for this medication. So he suggested that I bump up to 125mg or more in order to reach a ""therapeutic level"" with the medication. I'm honestly a little fuzzy around the edges with the term ""therapeutic level"" but there is a lot of science behind it, its an important word!! But truly bumping up was the best decision I've made, and it literally saved my life! Of course I am still struggling with my feelings of wishing life away, but it really kept my head above the water and got me out of the dark hole I was stuck in.

But it made me feel better that everyone was stuck at home, for the first time I kind of felt  this sense of connection to other people, because globally we are truly facing these challenges together. The first month of quarantine was great, I had my meds sorted, regular therapy sessions online, less school. But now with schools being held online, there is such lack of distraction and I feel as if I am slowly crawling into that hole again. So indifferent to idea of living, lacking purpose, routine and energy to make a change.  I guess you would say I'm lacking direction and stimulation.

But talking to my psychiatrist who has years of experience about dosages he had told me that 100mg is a pretty low dose for Zoloft and he always suggested that I go up so I can reach a therapeutic level. There’s like a lot of science around it. But I feel so much better taking  a higher dose than a smaller one. Maybe you should consult who ever is prescribing you about reaching your therapeutic level. Hope this helps!

depression_help,fof618m,t1_fof4edq,1587727260.0,"Please don’t lose hope. And I’m not saying medication is the cure to everything but you might have not been on one that reacted well with your system or not have reached a “therapeutic level” with the medication. When I first started hell it was just getting worse and worse, the side effect sucked, I still felt like killing my self and I was just a total train wreck. Even now I’m not sure if I’m on the right ones but they do drastically help me in my everyday life. They help quiet down all the negative thoughts, all the bad thoughts and let me think properly for once. And i still have bad days too, like today haha, but I still have hope and know I would never act upon my thoughts. And it’s not going to quick or easy, you have to be patient. Wanting to die isn’t a feeling that’s going to go away immediately, it might take years. I know a friend of mine who recently transitioned off of meds (bc they didn’t work for her) and she decided to try naturopathic solutions such as taking certain types of vitamins, exercising regularly,etc. but specifically mentioned she really enjoyed acupuncture. There are so many things that could work for you, it’s worth a shot to try anything really, please don’t be discouraged :) stay strong"
depression,fof52v3,t3_g73tqk,1587726317.0,"In my situation I entered therapy when I totally hit rock bottom. I was severely depressed, suicidal and couldn’t fathom the idea of waking up another day. But on the outside, I looked like totally fine. I would take regular showers, stay active, do my hair, put on my makeup and clothes. And even at school, I was the “funny” friend who cheered people up and I was also a straight A student who always did well in school. Yet I was in so much pain everyday, dying inside and bottling it all up. 

So while this was all going on, things got quite complicated. I had a shitty day, slashed my wrists, my parents freaked out, and wouldn’t leave me alone. They took me to many clinics and I met with so many professionals. I liked my therapist she was really nice and it seemed like she was good at what she did. But I don’t know I guess I was desensitized to everything, After so many years of repressing my feelings it was hard for me to open up. I struggled with pleasing others, perfectionism and sharing my feelings with others. 

I continued seeing her for around three months, and everything seemed okay, yet nothing was changing. The thoughts of dying were getting stronger and “talking about it” just wasn’t enough anymore. So I met with a psychiatrist who helped me start my medication journey. But it was just the beginning, starting an SSRI is a pain in the ass, and a lot of the times it’s more bad than good, it’s trial and error. The side effects suck ass but after about six weeks they normally all disappear. 

But once you find the right ones and reach a therapeutic level with your medication. Wow let me tell you they can drastically change your life. At first I was opposed of the idea of medication, I didn’t like the thought of a pill making me “happy” and the idea that I was dependent on something. But it actually saved my life and brought me out of my DEEP hole of straight up misery. I saw so many positive changes, i was actually progressing really well in therapy, untangling all the crap that lead me to my depression. And even today, I am still seeing the same therapist.

The pills don’t necessarily make you happy. They help quiet down the negative thoughts, the bad thoughts inside your mind is how I would phrase it for myself. But it’s different for everybody. And I still have bad days at times but I know I would never act upon the thought of ending my life like I did in the past. It feels like an uphill battle at first but you got to be patient.

If you don’t see any changes in your life after some time in therapy, I would seek out medication. Sometimes it’s just the chemicals in your brain that aren’t being produced. It’s LITERALLY not working. And that’s not you’re fault, you didn’t ask for it, nor did you do it to yourself, and you certainly cannot just suddenly be cured. Depression is an illness and must be treated like one, there’s a lot of science behind this disease. Anyways, I’m just saying it’s worth a shot, I mean what is there to lose if it doesn’t work, at least you know you tried. I hope you are staying safe and health, wishing you luck and all the best 💛stay strong!"

When I was 16 I didn’t know but for the longest time I didn’t know I was depressed at all, until it all got too much and was almost at the breaking point. I didn’t want to tell anyone what I was feeling I was scared of the judgment and scare of being perceived as “too young”, “faking it”, doing it for “attention” or that’s just “teenage angst”.

Depression can affect ANYONE, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, and life circumstances. For me I felt so invalidated for the longest time because on the outside my life was perfect, I had good grades, a heathy family, financially stable, living quite comfortably and I very high functioning. I just didn’t understand what went wrong, why was I feeling so low all the damn time? As time went on it just got worse and worse and almost led me to the very edge. Depression tricks your brain, I strongly believed no one cared about me, and my only concern was my family but thought my parents could “get over it”. But now after loads of therapy and medication, this illness is literally an ILLNESS! 

ALL feelings are valid. And anyone can have depression, even the most cheerful girl you know could be crying herself to sleep, that literally was me! We never know, because we never talk about it. I urge you to seek help, please seek out mental health resources and if you are comfortable tell someone you trust. Please please please talk to your parents about this, I  know it’s literally the hardest thing to do and your parents might not understand, mine had a hard time accepting my psychological situation. You might not know what to say or how to say it but just be like: “hey I’ve been feeling really down for a while, and I feel like I want to kill myself.” 

But trust me it WILL just get worse if untreated, because depression is a ILLNESS. You didn’t ask for it nor did you do it to yourself, it is not something that can magically turn on and off. And you can’t just “fix it” by yourself. Please never forget that it’s NEVER the depression that kills you, it’s ALWAYS the pent up emotions inside that lead you to go through with your thoughts. I hope you are okay and are going to be okay if not please reach out to me or anyone on reddit, sometimes it’s so much easier to talk to someone you don’t know because there’s no judgment and we are all struggling in this uphill battle. I hope you are staying safe and healthy, no one deserves to feel this way, wishing you all the best 💛"

depression,foe43gj,t3_g6zvm2,1587695629.0,"Hey, I’m so sorry you’re in such a difficult position. Firstly, you MUST tell your mother! From my perspective as someone who has dealt with severe depression and suicidal ideations, I don’t think I would be here now writing if I hadn’t reached out for help or talked to someone.

Because after all, it’s not the depression that kills you, it the pent up feelings inside that do. Depression is such a complex illness that plays with peoples minds. Hell, if I were to look back as a fifteen year old, I have no doubt I would never consider killing my self. Yet when I turned seventeen, I almost tried. 

And the scary thing is that if someone had not found out, then I wouldn’t be alive today. Mental illness is an ILLNESS! You cannot be healed if not treated. It’s hard for those around people who suffer from these issues but it’s even more ESPECIALLY harder for those afflicted to reach out for help!! Your father probably doesn’t want any of his loved ones to be worried or scared, he doesn’t want to be a burden. 

But trust me you can’t believe what you see on the outside. At 17 I was a straight A student, doing many extracurriculars, volunteering, I was literally a model student and yet inside I was hurting so bad that I wanted my life to end. Depression doesn’t discriminate race, age, ethnicity or religion. It is an ILLNESS, it is not something we do to ourselves or ask for. Depression can affect anyone no matter how good of a life they have, and regardless of their spiritual beliefs.

Believe me when I say your father doesn’t want to die. He doesn’t want to leave this world, go against his religious beliefs but he wants to escape the pain and misery he is feeling right now. Tell your mother, make sure she understands what depression really is, and approach your father carefully about this. Be patient and be understanding. 

It’s not as simple as just being sad. Sometimes it’s the chemicals in our brains that literally aren’t working properly enough. Please I hope everything goes smoothly with your father and your family. Stay strong, safe and healthy. Wishing you all the best ! 

(When you approach this topic, you should also look into some mental health resources— therapy, naturopathic solutions or psychiatry/medication, etc)"

depression,fo7wndh,t1_fo7jkvp,1587585812.0,"I totally relate after all who wants to be depressed? I think the world needs so much more awareness on mental health. The lack of it really makes it so much worse on people who are affected by mental illness. Because really it’s not the depression that kills someone, it’s the repressed and pent up thoughts that leads someone to ending their own life. The culture around mental has changed drastically and is put under a positive spotlight but unfortunately there is still so much stigma and lack of education around it. I think trying to find perspective and understanding another persons thought process and life experiences can help find peace with the situation. We deserve to be treated with love and kindness, no one deserves to be criticized and invalidated. Thanks for sharing your story, the world needs more strong people like you ❤️"

I’m sure she would be happy to help. I can put help make a format down here just to give u an idea of what you could write. 

Hi ________, 

I hope you and you’re family are doing well and staying safe during these trying times. 

There have been so many changes this past month, and to be completely honest, I’ve really been struggling to adjust to these changes. I feel as though my depression is affecting me in ways that have become unmanageable and I’ve been having trouble keeping up with all my school work. Im not really sure what to do with myself, I’ve been doing the bare minimum and getting my assignments in but I feel as though it is very mediocre. I don’t know what I should do, and I was struggling with as to how I should communicate my situation to my teachers. I feel ashamed of my poor work ethic and the thought of the results are very anxiety provoking. And I was wondering if you could help me pass this message on to my teachers? I hope you can understand, and it would be very much  appreciated.

Sorry to bother you at such a chaotic time. 

Thank you :)

Name

So this is kinda how I would go about it. But if you want to email teachers directly go for it! Don’t be so worried I’m sure your teachers will understand everyone’s stressed out because of this whole shit show. And I think if you’re just honest about it they’ll appreciate you opening up to them about this. I hope you’re okay and that you are going to be ok. If not you can always reach out to me. I’m graduating this year, so I’m only two years older than you, but for some reason you really remind me of myself when I was younger. I hope everything goes smoothly for you. Wishing you all the best❤️good luck, I believe in you!!"

therapy,fnyqanf,t3_g4ong7,1587371634.0,"I used to be in the same situation as you and as an empath it’s really a sticky situation. Just remember your first priority is YOURSELF. I think helping and supporting someone is one thing but thinking and worrying about them constantly is too much investment into their life. It will start to affect you mentally and not in a good way. You might take on their feelings and eventually go down the same road as them. You probably think you never would now but trust me it happens a lot, and it happened to me. I think the best way to help them is to just send them a text saying:

- I’m always here for you. 
-I hope you are okay and that you are going to be okay but if you aren’t please talk to me about it
-I know it’s really hard to open up and if you don’t want to talk about it I totally understand I don’t ask questions because I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable but just know I’m all ears 
- you deserve to be treated with love

Full on confrontation is not the best idea but I think a text is better because then they can think about it rather than panicking and lying to you. Please don’t forget to take care of yourself though. ThesE circumstances take a toll on all of us. Please stay safe and I hope this helped you out! :)"
depression_help,fnypln7,t3_g4nybk,1587370917.0,"I can’t relate to you more than anyone right now. Reading this seriously brought some sad memories for me. So I’ll explain my background a little. I’ve had depression since I was in grade four, partly genetic and partly because of me I guess? Idk. My psychiatrist tells me that I am “perfectionist” therefore I am too hard on myself. Fast forward to grade eight I developed an eating disorder, anorexia. At first my parents thought that I was “dieting”, which is totally not the same btw. I would still eat in front of my parents and everything but I would also exercise intensely. I got to the point where I was so thin that my heath became frail and I stopped menstruating. My mom started to force feed me so I gained weight but got even more depressed. 

I know I shouldn’t blame my parents because how are they suppose to know better? But i think deep inside I am still a little resentful. Because it’s not like they were unfamiliar with anorexia, it practically ran in my family! Anyways I got even more depressed in grade ten, would barely go to school, my once always impeccably clean room was extremely messy, I would sleep for hours on end and would isolate myself from others. 

It didn’t get any better after that in grade eleven I started to cut my wrists. It was far from a cry for attention, i was so scared of anyone finding out, it was my secret. The pain of knife would calm my mind and that terrible feeling in my chest would go away. But at that time I never contemplated suicide. In grade twelve my mental health had been untreated for so long and I was getting worse and worse by the day. The problem was I was such a functional person that no one would even notice. I would get up early, do my hair, my makeup, pick my outfit, eat breakfast, go to school, study and get good grades. I was a what they would call a “model student”.

But I kept getting these attacks in my chest and all I wanted to do was kill myself all the time. I just felt worthless and sad all the time I couldn’t deal with these overwhelming emotions anymore. I fought with my parents a lot and isolated myself from everyone I knew. I guess you could say I’m a quiet kid I don’t really like to share what I’m feeling I don’t know why, I guess because I didn’t want to bother them and I saw it as a weakness. I had everything bottled inside and even if I told them something I felt like they would disregard my problems and tell me I’m over exaggerating or doing this for attention. Because they failed to acknowledge my eating disorder why wouldn’t they do the same now? The suicidal feelings and thoughts got worse and worse and just when I was on the brink of going through with my plan to kill myself, my mom had seen my wrists. 

She cried so much and Depression makes you feel like you’re trash, unlovable and worthless so I was so surprised from her reaction. I was quickly soon seeking help and trying to recover but it was very very far from easy, and I still struggle but my mental health has gotten exponentially better. I just want you to know that you are never alone. So many people feel the way you do and I know saying “it gets better” is the shittiest thing someone could say but it actually does like for real !! And for the longest time i too was always in the mindset that “I’m not bad enough” to reach out for help and I’ve even thought so many times that I was imagining my depression. 

Like what the fuck how can you even imagine it and why would you even do that to yourself? Depression plays so many tricks on your mind. My advice for you would be to be honest with whomever you are close with and trust (parents or even friends, anyone really) just be like “hey so I’ve been feeling really down these days and im feeling suicidal” and I know the hardest part about this whole thing is admitting you have problems and that you need help! But trust me this will be a life changing step for you. Please seek help from a psychiatrist or psychologist, therapist, counsellor. You will get discouraged for the most part at the beginning but you can’t give up. Never give up on yourself and remember your feelings are totally valid and no one can say otherwise. 

I hope that you are going to be alright. I know it looks so dark right now but there is light at the end of the tunnel and I really hope you live to see it. The world needs strong people like you. I believe in you stay strong ❤️"

I don’t really have any helpful advice to offer as I am trying to cope with my depression as well, but I hope my message gives you some comfort. I’ve been depressed and suicidal for a few years now. Struggled with anorexia and self harm during that time. And I would say I am exponentially better in terms of my mental health, but I still do have moments of struggle. 

The reason being: I am taking antidepressants. For me these pills make everything in my head quiet, it allows me to live my regular life without constantly feeling this miserable pain. But the downside, it makes everything a bit too quiet, it makes me feel numb. The dose I’m taking is quite a high one 150mg of Zoloft and I’ve experimented with lower doses but quickly the suicidal feelings come back. So I just need to deal with it and live with no emotions, because after all it’s better than trying to kill myself. 

I don’t know why, but the smallest inconvenience just makes me spiral and my mind goes straight to why am I even living? What’s the point in life? Work, eat, sleep, pay bills, work more, and the same cycle is endless. Despite this I know deep down I still have hope. Hope that things will get better. I’ve always hated the saying “suicide is the easy way out” I think it’s rather a harsh way to put it but I do somewhat agree with its message. 

But the more I think about it, we aren’t meant to struggle all the time in this game of life, we should be experiencing a mixture of emotions both good and bad. There is light at the end of the tunnel. The message I’m trying to get across I guess is that it’s you’re life, you are in control, do what makes you happy. If you feel unsatisfied, try something new, change something, whatever you have to do. And I know it’s much easier said than done, because sometimes you truly aren’t interested in anything. 

But have you ever looked into mental health services like therapy or medication? I’m not advocating for medication but sometimes it can drastically change your life and pull you away from the edge. And trust me its usually a temporary fix just to keep you alive for the time being. I hope you are okay and are going to be okay.

nintendo,fnubwpp,t3_g3ptch,1587258754.0,"For so many people, self-isolation has felt unbearable, but for me, this quarantine has been a really nice relaxing break from a life that never seemed to stop. A break from the long and endless school weeks and hours of studying, being able to sit down and rediscover my hobbies is something I am really appreciating. The fact that I am no longer tied to any commitments and have no obligations to meet other people makes me feel so free. For a few years now, I've been stuck in a space that made me feel very alone and detached to the world around me, and oddly enough the idea that everyone is collectively quarantined in their homes in efforts of flattening the curve, gives me comfort and makes me feel more conneced to others. Despite this awful pandemic, I think these quiet times can help all of us to focus on ourselves, our well-being and about the things we care about :)"

mentalhealth,fntdz41,t3_g3orfw,1587239742.0,"YES I CAN TOTALLY RELATE! I’ve always had this love hate relationship with work, I want to succeed but at the same time it’s so hard for me to even bother with it in the first place. I’ve been struggling with chronic depression for the longest time which makes the situation even worse. I’m not sure if this will be applicable to your situation but based on professional insights that I’ve been consulting, this is a huge red flag for ANXIETY!! Many people struggle with this perpetual cycle and it stems from perfectionism. You feel like if you can’t do it perfect or the way you need it to be you might as well not bother with it which triggers your anxiety which can escalate to depression and the cycle continues. It’s ironic because often times I end up doing whatever needs to be done anyways. But of course on the outside I may seem lazy or as an extreme procrastinator but that’s not the case at all. I literally have ANXIETY!!! I’m sorry you feel this way, but I hope knowing you’re not alone gives you an ounce of comfort. Some tips I’ve acquired to avoid this type of mindset is by putting little quotes on my calendar or somewhere visible so I am reminded throughout the day: 

Such as “nothing is perfect”

“You’ve gotta start somewhere”

“There’s no such thing as mistakes, only happy accidents”

You are strong and beautiful, you can get through this. I’m so sorry you have gotten to this point, but you can get past this and I believe in you. I hope you feel less alone reading this message, please take care of yourself you deserve to be treated with love ❤️"

Often depression makes our situations seem even more impossible than they might be. I too have experienced the exhausting effects of depression, constantly plagued by this sense of low motivation. Just take each day one day at a time. It’s okay to not be okay. 

From my experiences I’ve been depressed since I was a child and I don’t know why but I felt so burdened by what other people and society expected of me. I felt guilty for feeling this way, after all other people have it way worse so I refrained from sharing with anyone what I was really feeling inside. The isolation was unbearable and I almost attempted to take my life. At the time I was reaching out for help to different mental health clinics but due to high demand it was such an agonizingly long and stressful process. I was over it at that point, it was hard enough for me to let alone reach out for support I couldn’t handle this added stress. 

I was hopeless but I finally had found a good psychologist who really helped me pave my way out of a dark tunnel. But I still wasn’t okay, often times therapy doesn’t do much because it takes way too long, it’s taxing and expensive. So I met with a psychiatrist who helped me get on to take some medication. And it truly changed my life. I don’t think I would have lasted that long if I hadn’t started on anti-depressants. 

Im not trying to advocate for medication but sometimes it’s really a chemical imbalance in your brain. You can’t blame yourself because your brain doesn’t produce certain chemicals. But you know if you ever get to the edge I urge you to seek professional help via online, whether it’s for therapy or medication (you can get prescribed online). I’m not sure if this is relatable to you but I’m praying this gave you an ounce of hope because there is always light at the end of the tunnel! Stay safe and I hope you find happiness because you deserve to be happy :)"
therapy,fnng669,t3_g2n2t2,1587091615.0,"I know saying don't worry about it is useless but really don't worry about it. I struggled with math for so so so so so long and I felt this sort of pressure from peers and those around me that I had to excel in every subject in order to be ""successful"" in life, whatever that means. And I was literally in the exact spot as you are as a student. Things got much harder and I was struggling to keep it together. I realized that I wasn't as good as some people at certain things and life was just gonna get harder and harder. I got really depressed and suicidal and very much was on the verge of ending my life. With the help of lots of therapy and getting the right medication, I can finally say that I am feeling ""okay"". I hope my story gives you a bit of encouragement and hope, i know it feels like things will never get better but there is light at the end of the tunnel. But you know your life is YOUR LIFE. Who says you have to be good at math anyways. YOU CAN DO WHATEVER THE FUCK U WANT. DO WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY :)"
depression_help,fnjwo13,t3_g2047w,1587008769.0,U are not alone. I struggle with this so so much. I used to think maybe I was burnt out but :( my therapist says that it’s a red flag for anxiety. Personally this stems from my issues with “perfectionism”. You know you don’t want to do something because you’re not confident it’ll be perfect so you stall until the last minute which gives you more anxiety. It’s a perpetual cycle. You just gotta take it one step at a time and be easier on yourself. I’m not sure if this is relatable for you but I hope you find it helpful :)
depression_help,fngzk3r,t3_g0muu3,1586950547.0,"18 F I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for the majority of my life, and right when I was at the verge of ending my own life I started taking Zoloft. Honestly I don’t know where I would be without it. My mood is completely unstable without the medication. Before I would have consistent crying spells, anxiety attacks and suicidal periods. I’ve gone from having suicidal thoughts everyday to almost none today. It’s been a miracle cure for me. I don’t know how I was even living before it was an absolute nightmare. I really recommend you give them a shot, it could be the thing that saves your life. But you have to be patient, it feels terrible at first but trust me it will get better (if it’s the right medication for u) and I know saying “it gets better” is really shitty encouragement because honestly who believes that, but it truly does. Hang in there, wishing you all the best ❤️"
depression_help,fngynxx,t3_g0zoba,1586949713.0,"Honestly speaking as an older sister I would definitely want know if my younger sister is struggling with depression or whatever that may be. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for the longest time and it’s still hard for me to keep all those feelings at bay sometimes. But if my sister were to open up to me about these feelings I don’t think I would feel triggered at all. In fact, I think that would bind us even closer than we are today. Depression is really an abstract concept, it’s hard to explain, describe and it’s different for everyone. I think it’s better you tell your sister about your depression before it gets out of hand, she’ll be reassured that way. If she were to find out later she would be worried as would any other family member. If you confide now you will have an easier time seeking the right professionals and help that you need. Trust me I’ve been extremely discouraged while looking for help, especially since mental health services are largely unsupported despite the growing population of people who are afflicted with mental illness."
depression_help,fngxsdq,t1_fngx7it,1586948858.0,"If it’s accessible I would also look into online services (psychiatry/therapy)! That is what I’m using during this pandemic. Wishing you all the best, good luck!! 🍀"
depression_help,fngnxqj,t3_g1e2of,1586938554.0,"From my personal experience with depression as a teen, I can relate a lot to your brother. Often my depression would make me irritated and as a result I fought a lot with my parents. This really made my depression worse because I always had trouble expression my emotions but even more i felt like no one, not even my parents cared to hear about my feelings and would simply brush them off saying I’m “going through a stage”. I kept isolating myself similarly, to your brother and eventually became extremely suicidal. What i highly recommend is that you as his sister talk to your parents about this. It’s best that you approach your parents about the situation firsthand to avoid unnecessary arguments and so that they have time to think about it. It’s scary as a parent and they might not know how to react firsthand. I hope you and your family all the best. Good luck ❤️"
