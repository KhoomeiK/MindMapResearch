AskWomen,ffuswdd,t3_ev4g4l,1580248727.0,"Video games (chill or RPG story based and take turns),  read large picture books together (I know you're thinking kids stuff right but I mean literally books that two people can look at) and board games. Board/video games incorporate so many aspects of team work and problem solving. My strengths and weaknesses are matched by partner so we are a rocking team for tricky games. Helps us with conflict resolution and understanding each other, not that we fight ever but in games things can get heated up with difficult scenarios. My partner is my player 2 and games/geeky stuff is a huge part of why I think we've had such a successful and fun relationship."

Diet high in protein will help with wound repair and I'd get a gp involved if you cab for ongoing management to ensure no infection occurs. I'd follow up with the hospital how that occurred, most hospitals should have pressure area prevention policies and procedures in place."

Maybe use a hylaronic acid on top if you feel you'll dry out but make sure you research the molecular type of the product ie.  Low - high."
AusFinance,exrumx4,t1_exrhhzt,1566524546.0,"I'll link you to the program all students have to apply to for a graduate job in the public system. Private they apply directly to the hospitals. Yet again I didn't say for a job I said a graduate job which are different. You can only apply for a graduate year once, if you aren't successful to bad but good luck getting a job in a hospital straight out with no post study experience. Of course anyone that meets the job description and inclusion criteria can apply for a job. 

Without getting argumentative here, your information on wages was also based on hear say so let's leave that one as its organisational based.

Link to PMCV eligibility criteria if you'd like to see the graduate year inclusion list on page 3.

AusFinance,expudhh,t1_exk9kil,1566494444.0,"I agree there are some nurses should not be looking after people, especially if they don't like their job. To clarify, I never said they didn't qualify as a registered nurse but that they likely didn't get accepted into a public graduate year. The public grad year is highly desirable, sought after, well supported and often offers continued employment. Obviously there are some individuals that automatically don't meet the requirements for the public system.  Unfortunately have no choice but to apply for the private sector if they wish to work in a hospital.

 Interesting ! I've literally heard the opposite about wages but maybe it depends on the company that owns the private hospitals. 

At the end of the day. If you have HI or you don't, the care you receive shouldn't be any different."

Yeah it's hard but with check ups with my chrio and an occasional massage I'm set. I've also changed my exercise and diet which improved my stress levels thus my back pain too. It's about being mindful of your approach to physically tasks. I've refused to do a task simply based on the risk of injuring my back.  I've got extra hands and equipment if need be instead. Most parents understand when I say I can't lift you etc. You'll be working for a long time in this job,  regardless of the compounding issue of your back, you have to be careful. I do know nurses that have left nursing due to back problems but they weren't from scoliosis. Every case is different so I'd say take a chance,  go for it.  You'll know if your back won't let you continue nursing. The rewards of my career for out way the pain of my scoliosis."
