AskWomen,fn65il5,t3_fzilqv,1586688235.0,"When I first met my, now, husband I didn't think of him romantically at all, he was shy and didn't make eye contact. He was a housemate of mine at Uni and gradually we spent more and more time together and he came out of his shell as a funny, kind hearted and super intelligent guy. I enjoyed spending time with him but still didn't feel a spark as such, I was used to 'bad boy' types that didn't treat me great to be honest  so I just didn't notice him like that. 

Eventually I spent a lot of time with him in his room gaming together and one thing led to another. Still even at this point of being physical it wasn't romantic just FWB. We were FWB exclusively for maybe 2 years. Then we broke it off as we had graduated and the travel was too much to see each other. 

We didn't see each other or speak for 3 months and I missed him beyond belief and got back in contact with him, he was seeing someone and I was crushed and realised how much I loved him. All I wanted was to have him back with me. He mentioned to me that he was thinking of splitting up with the girl he was seeing as he wasn't really into her. Once he did I pretty much immediately told him I had feelings for him and wanted us to be together properly and he felt the same :D . So fast forward 3 years later we got married and have been married nearly 2 years. I live with my best friend and enjoy every day with him and I am so thankful and lucky to be married to him.

It's not the fairy tale immediate spark that people talk about and it wasn't a romantic start at all but it takes some of us a while to realise how we should be treated by a partner and when we finally do it's like a light bulb turns on, we deserve someone that treats us with respect and once you know that you might be surprised what wonderful people you are open to be with."

I have not used any chemical birth control in over 6 years, my husband and I have been using the 'pull out' method for 4 years before we started casually trying and now I have been temping etc since May to try and conceive. I went to the doctors (from the UK) in September and she kind of scared me, she didn't seem too bothered about my long/Irregular periods, but as soon as I said about our lack of proper contraceptives for so long she ordered all the tests and got all serious about our fertility. I've had blood tests, one came back low progesterone so we tested again and they were apparently fine. I'm temping and it appears to find ovulation, but ovulation kits have only come back positive like twice in all this time.

We've been unprotected for over a year, pullout technique over 4 years before that but actively aiming for fertile window since May/June which is making our TTC seem very long when really we've only had 3-4 cycles within perceived fertile window. so I have to keep reminding myself of that. Anyhuu, I've had my hormones tested to see why my cycles are so long/irregular, my biggest fear was that maybe I wasn't ovulating as I've never had a strong positive on a ovulation test and my temping always seems to change its predicted ovulation and the charts are all over the place. The tests came back normal but my progesterone was low so they ordered another test this time checking my thyroid as well as the progesterone etc. This time it all came back normal even the progesterone. So what the heck is happening? Is my progesterone randomly low some cycles and not on others? I wondered if the first blood test ended up at the wrong time of my cycle as we tried our best to guesstimate the best time based on when my last period was and when I think ovulation happened but it's very difficult. Should I be worried about this low progesterone test result the first time round? Nurse seems to be moving forward with my husband getting tested now with no word of any further testing for me.

TTC30,f66ohdi,t1_f66nf4d,1572712691.0,Thanks for this! Wishing you all the best! Xx
TTC30,f66lm98,t1_f66kaou,1572712071.0,"This gives me hope, I've convinced myself that I must not ovulate. I've also heard that some people only get a really dark line for a few short hours in a day at its peak and maybe I just miss that whilst I'm at work or something?"
TTC30,f66jjrn,t3_dqmblv,1572711552.0,"I have the same issue, I'll get a dark line but never darker/ same as control line. Commenting to see if someone can answer us. Sorry can't be helpful to you."
TryingForABaby,f60dbq1,t1_f60ctsh,1572614135.0,"Gah nightmare! My cycles are irregular and long as it is but I certainly notice, any illness or stress seems to put off my period. Need to make note if it's my ovulation that gets put back or if it's in the luteal phase that lasts longer. Will def look into this to see! Mad isn't it?!"
TryingForABaby,f606clm,t3_dq1qzv,1572607286.0,"If I get sick it does throw off my period, nature's way of messing with us! Hopefully that's not the case for you though. Fingers crossed for a positive!! Xx"
TryingForABaby,f5vxtma,t1_f5viu3a,1572505421.0,Yeah you would have thought people wouldn't be so rude. I find it really difficult to know how to react to the comments. I'm trying to prepare myself for Christmas. I could just about cope before but now I fear bursting into tears or making a scene with a snide reaction. I just hope people would back off and keep their comments to them selves.
TryingForABaby,f5sizph,t3_dp0fs8,1572432732.0,"I totally feel you on this, I'm dreading Christmas so much. Recently been told I have low progesterone levels which is most likely the reason for my infrequent cycles and why we haven't viably conceived yet. Twas a killer blow to then see a member of the families 12 week scan all over social media. Christmas will all be about  her pregnancy and the new bundle of joy, as it should be, but I dread the questions and comments 'oh you next' , ' you should have one soon so they can play together' and the horrible 'you aren't getting any younger' comments. I want to avoid it all together but I can't without upsetting people. How am I going to get through it!? Wishing you all sticky babies this Christmas, fingers still crossed!!"

TryingForABaby,f12fpnk,t3_d7lx9l,1569139690.0,"In the same boat, we've not been trying for very long and now I have this feeling of dread that it will never happen. I feel ridiculous as I know it can take time without there being anything wrong. I have irregular periods and I've convinced myself this means I don't ovulate and that's why it hasn't happened yet, I have no proof of this so I should take the advise of 'just relax and it will happen', but you are right, how can we relax when this is something we've always wanted and planned for and what if it doesn't happen?!  Fingers crossed we all get the news we want soon!"

TwoXChromosomes,f0me1lp,t3_d5fh3y,1568742843.0,"Oh OP I know all to well how you feel, my friend took her life last July. Sometimes, I'm about to reach for my phone to tell her something that happened that she would find funny or to ask her advice and it hits me like a ton of bricks, she's gone and there's nothing I can do about it. It's a great sadness we just have to live with. It will never be ok.

On a side note if it would help you at all there is a suicide bereavement sub Reddit, I have found this helpful in processing what happened with my friend, if you think it may help you, have a look. All the best to you OP xx"
waiting_to_try,ezwv89n,t1_ezwjyko,1568225820.0,"If it's really irregular book an appointment with a doctor. Just knowing I'm going to see someone about it has put my mind at ease, it might help you plan your timeline for babies too. Best of luck to you!"
waiting_to_try,ezvtyqj,t3_d2n7fe,1568196870.0,"We (late 20's) want to start properly trying to have a baby, I feel mentally ready, we are married and have a small house, it wouldn't be the worst situation if we got pregnant. We live in a rural area far away from any good schools etc and commute a long way for work. Logically we need to move before having children, I grew up fairly poor and if we are lucky enough to have children I want to make sure we can provide them with the best chances we can. I have irregular periods and can't seem to work out when/if I ovulate on any of the period tracking apps. In honesty we haven't exactly been being careful in months since I can't pinpoint fertile days to avoid. I'm so worried something is wrong. I've booked an appointment to talk about my irregular periods atleast I will have answers and be able to have a plan in place and stop worrying so much."

This gives me so much hope, my cycles are so long and varied that I'm having some major issues figuring out when I'm fertile, it's making me really nervous maybe I never am.
