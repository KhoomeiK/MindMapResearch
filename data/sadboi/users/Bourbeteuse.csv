AdultDepression,fgkxm34,t1_fgjeygt,1580876064.0,I would say refusing to give up counts as a success. I gave up for awhile and it makes life so much more lonely and difficult. I truly hope you get what you're looking for.
AdultDepression,fget760,t3_exehgs,1580709126.0,Will you please update how you're doing? This post hit so close to home. I'd love to hear if you've had any success with... anything really. The struggle is overwhelming sometimes.
AdultDepression,fg7vklo,t3_exehgs,1580602560.0,You're not alone in feeling like this. I feel for you.

There's supposedly a rollercoaster on top of one of the casinos, a zip line over the main drag, also one of the casinos has a water slide that goes through a shark tank. I've never been to LV but those are the best things I've heard about it. Sorry you're stuck at the moment."

SuicideBereavement,f1bmyeu,t1_f1bhzq7,1569338359.0,"I'd like to believe it was a visitation dream. It's so hard to feel the absence of our loved ones. I woke up so happy, feeling like I had seen her. It's nearly impossible to make any sense out of the loss so maybe we can have a little hope instead."
SuicideBereavement,f1bcmfv,t3_d8mcgb,1569331073.0,"Grief manifests in strange ways. I would occasionally have dreams with my sister in them where she was just with me and we didn't directly interact. A few days before my brother passed I dreamed I was waiting in line for a bathroom and she suddenly walked up to me and hugged me tightly saying she's missed me and was so happy to see me. I don't really think it means anything other than I miss her. Still, the dream is very emotional for me to think about. I don't want to pretend I could interpret yours but it could just mean you miss her and love her?"

SuicideBereavement,etpe3l2,t1_eto6r89,1563052966.0,"It's true, I wish this subreddit was available when my sister died. I lost most of my friends, couldn't find a good therapist for my particular issues. I went back to college determined to turn my tragedy into something positive. I ended up becoming an embalmer. Being so close to death was healing, I was great at it, and my coworkers were some of the most compassionate but wickedly funny people I had ever met. 
Unfortunately I had to leave that job. This time, with my brother's death, I feel broken. I feel like I can't drag myself from the despair. It's too much"

SuicideBereavement,eto35g5,t1_eto2rr6,1563011175.0,Thank you. Its helps more than I thought to talk about it. To remember that other people know what it's like. So many that have never experienced this seem to keep their distance or judge you.
SuicideBereavement,eto167n,t1_eto0lv4,1563008628.0,I'm sorry you lost them.
SuicideBereavement,eto0yrp,t1_eto0lv4,1563008376.0,"That's the worst for me, thinking about something I wanted to tell him so we could get a good laugh. All the jokes we had, the way he would make fun of me like only sibling can. I don't think he actually wanted to die, it was done in a moment of anger. I know he didn't really want to."
SuicideBereavement,eto00g1,t1_etnz9yx,1563007177.0,"Thank you for saying something nice. I just don't know that that's true anymore. I spent six years feeling pain, guilt, remorse, all those terrible feelings that happen after she shot herself. Then seven months ago my brother shot himself. I was there I can still hear the gunshot and him falling, see all the blood. That doesn't leave you easily."
