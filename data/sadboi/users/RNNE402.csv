TravelNursing,eyzc96p,t3_czm8r3,1567614446.0,I interviewed for a hospital with a manager that used to be a traveling nurse. She told me she doesn't generally like to offer travelers overtime because she knows what the agencies charge being the manager but also knows what the travelers are actually taking home out of that having been a traveler. She said it's an insane difference. Why?

AskReddit,ex1m84u,t3_cr42di,1565949737.0,"Oh man
As a female I had mostly male friends in high school. There was one that was the all American boy. Tall, blonde hair, blue eyes, football player, and the hilarious class clown. He asked me out a handful of times but I was already dating someone and turned him down every time. We graduated, went to different towns for college then he became a teacher and moved the Czech Republic and I became a nurse. 

Eight years after high school he comes home for the summer and because of Facebook knows I'm still living in our hometown. He messages me to meet up for drinks and catch up. And so begins the best most amazing summer of my life. We were inseparable. Best friends who had the most mind blowing incredible sex. It was like we were totally meant to be. We actually spent a night under the stars while a meteor shower was at it's peak. It was on his brother's farm totally private. We kept commenting on how long we could have had this and how far we would be in life together if I had only said yes back in high school. August rolls around and he has to move back overseas due to his teaching contract. Two days before he moves I accepted a nursing job in another state. It was all so final. We tried to keep in touch but it was just so difficult. My summer fling turned into the love of my life. He's married now with a son and living in Canada.  I miss him. Everything about him. 

I've been in a couple of relationships since then. It's not the same. I fear I will never feel that way about someone again. It's been six years since that summer.
