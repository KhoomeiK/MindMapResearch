BPD,fr2xurm,t3_gm6vj7,1589845997.0,"I’m a 39F, diagnosed as bipolar II when I was 19 (my mom is also bipolar) and my therapist started discussing testing me for BPD about 6 months ago. After spending about 5 minutes on here, I think she’s on to something lol. I had my oldest daughter, now 24, when I was 15, and have a 17 year old daughter and 16 year old son. Truthfully, I don’t think there is a true way to hide or shield your children from mental illness. They are going to be exposed to it, in some way, but how you communicate your illness to them, that will be what determines how much it fucks them up. My children have seen me manic high, suicidal, depressed, they’ve been through my separations from their dad, my complete emotional breakdowns, and most recently, an affair I had. I’ve never made excuses for my behavior, I’ve never blamed my illness, my parents, my past traumas, etc. and it’s taken YEARS of therapy to ACCEPT that all parents make mistakes, mine are just 100x more damaging, which has required me to be way more open, honest, and raw with my kids than a lot of people may think is appropriate. My children are loved unconditionally, that in itself is how I know I’m doing things a hell of a lot better than they were done for me!!! 😍❤️🥰"

BPD,fqhq5tk,t3_giuxeg,1589382164.0,"Everything!!! My head is full, and I mean FULL of every thought, feeling, and emotion, but all on the inside. All accompanied with an intense fear that anything I try to verbalize won’t be heard, and if it is, that I’ll be accused of lying, manipulating, gaslighting, etc. It’s exhausting and worse, excruciating, because usually it’s the person you want to open up to, bond with, and talk to the most that you withdraw from and then not only do they blame you for your lack of ability to communicate, you blame yourself. And usually I don’t “speak up” until I’m triggered enough to snap, and nothing healthy is coming out of that. Patience and understanding (I know, it’s never ending) that quiet on the outside doesn’t mean there is no feeling and chaos on the inside trying to find a safe and coherent way to be shared. ❤️"

I’ve been married 20 years, and my husband is a rock. We’ve struggled with my chronic infidelities over the years. And I struggle with the incessant needs daily. Therapy and mood stabilizers have started to help. Good luck!!! :)"
