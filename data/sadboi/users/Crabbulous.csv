depression,fk5w11q,t3_fgfgsv,1583888938.0,"Hello OP. Just want to tell you that most people can‚Äôt comprehend the experience of others if they have not experienced it, therefore they invalidate and minimize. This is a reflection of their reality, not yours. I hope you get the help you need and I also want to tell you that, at 36, I‚Äôve dealt with feelings similar to yours for over 20 years. It doesn‚Äôt get better, but YOU get better. You become better equipped to deal with these emotions and you find people who aren‚Äôt shitty to you about them. Hang in there."
