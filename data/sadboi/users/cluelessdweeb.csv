I feel like you’ll appreciate one of my latest discoveries: it is criminally simple to make your own butter. I’ve been doing it for weeks now. If you feel a particular need for a physical outlet, put heavy cream into a mason jar and start shaking, otherwise you can hypnotize yourself with a stand mixer. Just keep shaking or mixing the cream until it goes from liquid to solid to “thump-slosh-thump-slosh” set aside your new liquid (buttermilk) for pancakes, and rinse your ball of butter until the water runs clear even when you squeeze. Fold in salt/cinnamon sugar/herbs/roasted garlic to your hearts content before slathering onto homemade bread."

BakingNoobs,fj8gy4n,t1_fj7rjfh,1583113153.0,"It’s actually super simple.

I used my kitchen aid with the paddle mixer, all you need is heavy cream and whatever herbs you want.

Start the mixer with your desired amount of cream (1 quart cream~1 lb butter) on low until it thickens enough that it won’t slosh. Keep speeding the mixer as you can until you’re at a med high speed. You’ll see the cream become whipped cream first, then it’s going to break down into crumbles that look a bit like butter (but it isn’t yet!), you’ll know your butter is done when it starts sloshing again as the buttermilk separates from the butter. I lower the speed to avoid spills and let it separate for 1-2 minutes before stopping. Pull the butter out of the bowl and rinse under cold water while massaging well to make sure all of the buttermilk is rinsed out of the butter. Once the water runs clean you’re done!

You can add the herbs or salt before or after, but if you plan on using the buttermilk you’ll want to fold your extras in after rinsing your butter."
