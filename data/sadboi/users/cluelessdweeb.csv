Just keep shaking or mixing the cream until it goes from liquid to solid to ‚Äúthump-slosh-thump-slosh‚Äù set aside your new liquid (buttermilk) for pancakes, and rinse your ball of butter until the water runs clear even when you squeeze.

I used my kitchen aid with the paddle mixer, all you need is heavy cream and whatever herbs you want.

Start the mixer with your desired amount of cream (1 quart cream~1 lb butter) on low until it thickens enough that it won‚Äôt slosh. Keep speeding the mixer as you can until you‚Äôre at a med high speed. You‚Äôll see the cream become whipped cream first, then it‚Äôs going to break down into crumbles that look a bit like butter (but it isn‚Äôt yet!), you‚Äôll know your butter is done when it starts sloshing again as the buttermilk separates from the butter. I lower the speed to avoid spills and let it separate for 1-2 minutes before stopping. Pull the butter out of the bowl and rinse under cold water while massaging well to make sure all of the buttermilk is rinsed out of the butter. Once the water runs clean you‚Äôre done!

You can add the herbs or salt before or after, but if you plan on using the buttermilk you‚Äôll want to fold your extras in after rinsing your butter."
