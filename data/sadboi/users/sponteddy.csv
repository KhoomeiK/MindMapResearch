Witches,fj4y2dm,t3_fbimho,1583019656.0,"My family is SDA. I started reading books on my own in private... SDA forbids witchcraft! It's conflicting, but I think it's a calling to explore a different  spiritual path! Proceed with caution. If You agree wit anything that this Protestant/Christian church has taught you, you're basically condemned to hell for practicing esoteric spirituality.. I will say though that if you explore this it's gonna be hard because of dogmas that have been ingrained you, like believing that witchcraft is immoral and sinful... you WILL feel guilty, like your betraying Jesus. You will find your truth but you will never experience a breakthrough or find the answers you're looking for without trying new things. Try it out."

singing,fizrbdc,t3_fan0hx,1582871633.0,"I say do it. It's scary all the way through but it's the perseverance that will help you get through it.  I was casted lead for the first role I auditioned for. It's shocking. I know. I am the most nervous person out there but i also knew that i had the voice in me just like you. When I did the audition, i nailed it because I KNOW singing is what i do best... also, I was shaking up to the point until I started singing. It was easy right after. I think the nerves added a layer of excitement it but it also added character personality (I'm neurotic lol) to my audition... I shocked the directors with my amazing voice, they couldn't say no! Don't be afraid to be good! Get out there and DO IT. THIS IS WHAT YOU WERE MEANT TO DO."

askgaybros,firrvg4,t3_f9fa3e,1582670127.0,"It's like they do it fr attention. For ex, if you're gay a girl is more likely to talk about girly things with you (like period stuff) and assume ur interested in it when you're not. Like, they don't even have these conversations with their boyfriends? am I supposed to comment on how your breasts look in that dress without getting wet ?  That makes me uncomfortable? I am bi but I don't like the fact that my girlfriends think it's OK to make out with me at a party because i happen to be bi and cute, yet I'm not the one to get the attention at the end of the night. I give up. straight guys think gay guys have all the access cause we hang with women al the time, truth is we never had the chance because they have emasculated so now they see as other or personal objects. Same for straight men, they just wanna talk to network with the ladies if you know what I mean. Girl like us gays to project  that we're the super freaky, vulgar, homo type... ""oh, he's gay."""

askgaybros,fi5brpg,t1_fi41nc4,1582159479.0,"I was looking at it from a psychological perspective. I didn't intend on generalizing...  I should have added more details to my question. Was my question too direct? Obviously, It's common sense that not every gay man wants to be a woman but I'm speaking about those who seem to be ""highly effeminate"" like James Charles. James is a successful YouTuber/makeup artist with a massive following. James identifies as a boy but my intuition tells me that he sees himself as a girl, like a beautiful Kylie Jenner. It seems to me that James would play the role of a female in a gay relationship? One of his IG post, which featured him in a cute blonde wig, captioned, ""if you had the chance to change your gender, would you?"". This post made me wonder if there are more gay men out there who experience gender dysphoria?  Could gay men like James Charles be in denial? I have dated men who act similar to James but I have NEVER had the heart to ask them this question out of fear they would get offended... This sucks because trans issues are serious topics that I care about, toxic masculinity is real thing (the gay community is no exception), and asking a man if they wished they we're a girl is threatening to them.... ESPECIALLY if you have been called a ""girl"" growing up like it was supposed to be an insult. I ask this question out of genuine curiosity, not to judge or critique others. For those of you who just upped the ""no,"" you're probably in-denial or you are offended by my question... I apologize for that! I genuinely want to know."

Is it really your goal if it doesn't come from the subconscious because Some spiritual practitioners argue that dreams have a lot of spiritual significance.

AstralProjection,f8m7n3b,t3_e0sb4a,1574628939.0,"To pick life or death. Life is a test. Occult practices are sinful, and in the modern age, a big temptation. Jesus Christ is the Truth. Astral projection is another dream-like state. Enlightenment? You mean, awakening third eye chakra? Don’t fall for the game. The third eye is the 6th Chakra... three eyes= 666 This is the mark of the beast on thy face and forehead, but there are three beast which you should read about. Each one could potentially have its mark. By practicing esoteric spirituality you’ve basically dismissed His holiness from your life and are at war with God because you opened your heart to Darkness and evil, which has taken the form of light. Don’t be surprised if you start seeing things or if bad things start happening to you, or if you become confused  because there’s a spiritual war happening behind the scenes.  Enlightenment is not peace. It’s like anxiety and knowing the infinite possibilities and never being able to find out what’s real and what isn’t. People are lying to you. Why are you blind to the beauty of the physical realm... God is magnificent, he shows us love in soo many ways and in everything he creates. 

The  mark of the beast can be identified in the spiritual realm, it shows God that you’ve rejected His word.  It’s like eating from the forbidden tree of knowledge and wisdom, or “enlightenment” and becoming branded with an extra eye. think about it.  the internet gives you a lot of false information. Do you trust your reddit brother when you ask them these questions? Search for the answer to your questions by yourself. 
The  internet shows us everything in the spectrum from dark to light... however, we have a choice to search for what we want and if it’s honest and pure the answer will come. I choose to follow Jesus. . Did you know you can develop the ability to SEE through the darkness and the occult with the light of the Holy Spirit. It’s magical. I’m not religious myself, but I know it’s the truth as God  has given us many signs of his existence. Everything created is by design. We could have destroyed our planet long ago but God has prevented that from happening and had shown us mercy. Science tells us that we are Overdue for many tragic natural disasters... the time will come. Read the book of revelations"

ShaneDawson,f61cgxz,t1_f26baqk,1572637780.0,"Good eye. 

I know what you mean. Think about the mythology behind that one book. “Lord of the Flies,” or Beelzebub the demon.... the head of the DEAD pig on a stick represents savagery, the darkness that the boys embraced through killing. The dead pig is the physical manifestation of the Devil, Beelzebub is known to be demon or a Prince of Satans kingdom. 

If this is accurate imagine what you’re inviting into your home... 

Nothing. But. Evil.

Open your mind..."
