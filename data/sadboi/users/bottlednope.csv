Today I'm still very tired, a bit restless and pretty tense and my throat is sore and inflamed and I have a couple of ulcers on it. Does happen occasionally when I'm super stressed and I'm not having any problems breathing or anything.

Do you know is serotonin syndrome can cause rash? It's not listed in the symptoms. Basically, I wore a necklace on Monday last week that irritated my skin and its been itchy ever since but today it's so itchy and burning. Urgh, what a nightmare this entire thing has been.

mentalillness,ez8zmtz,t3_d0dlxa,1567767749.0,"I'm so sorry that you're having such a tough time of it and I can completely empathise. I've been on too many meds to name since I was 16 and I know I'll probably never be medication free again. And I'm 32 so I'm at that same point of sometimes feeling defeated.

The biggest thing that has helped me is being in a group therapy setting which makes me not feel so alone and the support is incredible. And it gets me out of my head as I can get really foggy too.

If you feel like the medication is working but the side effects outweigh the benefits, maybe speak to your doctor about other alternatives. There are so many different options out there, including treatments like ECT and TMS as well.

It took me a long time to find peace with what I'm dealing with and realising my true limitations. When I did this, I didn't give up but quite the opposite. I found ways to work around them so I can still do the things I want to do, instead of fighting it so hard and beating myself up that I'd just freeze and panic anyway.

And being as open and honest about my struggles as possible with those I love and trust. I've been blown away but just how supportive, curious and compassionate people have been in understanding my illnesses. 

I hope that helps in some way xx"
mentalillness,ez8prsu,t3_d0aued,1567752977.0,"If you can be prescribed medication for your ADHD from a GP, then it's definitely worth looking into at least. It doesn't mean it will be Ritalin and because you struggle with anxiety too, they may suggest a non-stimulant anyway (I'm taking one of them). It does really help but if this isn't possible, here are some things I find helpful.

Break down tasks into the absolute smallest portions. It might be ""write essay title"" ""write 50 words"". Reward yourself for these! Take a break after each achievement. It's talked about that in general our attention span is around 45 mins at a time so breaking things down is helpful anyway.

As others have said, lots of breaks. Make sure you are well fed, hydrated, comfortable, have everything that you need with you. So many times I'll be working on a project and wonder why I'm struggling only to suddenly realise that I'm shaking because I'm so hungry (yay, hyperfocus lol)

Write an outline. Or a to do list for the essay. That way you don't forget anything and you can just refer to the list and move on to the next step.

Use fidget toys/doodling/keeping hands preoccupied. Sometimes I need to fidget or have some parts of my brain focused on something else to actually pay attention properly.

Also figure out what environment is going to distract you less. Is it loud or quiet? Music or no music? Will facing a window mean you start staring off into nothingness?

I actually also find that taurine helps as well (like in Red Bull).

I hope this helps!"

As someone who is 10-11 months out of a relationship with my ex-fiance, the main thing that ended our relationship was the severe nature of my mental illness and the fact I'm still in the thick of therapy and figuring out healthy ways to cope.

He was under a lot of stress because I'm too sick to work and he had basically always put his own mental health on the back burner. Unfortunately it got to breaking point and he had to leave for his own health.

It sucked (it still sucks yo) but I know it was healthier for us both to split. Now I know for the future that my mental health journey (going to DBT, seeing my psych, taking my meds) is MY responsibility and I really only need loving support and understanding from a future partner and hugs. 

My ex was very much the ""I want to save you"" type and while it was wonderful to have someone who genuinely wanted to know about my illness (I'd never had a partner do that before), it ultimately lead to our undoing.

The main thing that stops me from future relationships is my dysfunctional attachment style and my mental illness (as this was the major reason my ex and I split). Urgh, so confusing!!!"
mentalillness,eymx41g,t1_eykv3up,1567222872.0,"Thank you so much for such a heart felt response. Honestly, just having someone tell me that they don't think I'm crazy is huge in itself. I'll definitely try my best to be brave and share this with others, even when it's hard."
mentalillness,eymx0eh,t1_eykromj,1567222770.0,Thank you so much for responding. There is always positives and negatives to being aware of one's emotions and behaviours. Positive that I can change it and negative because ignorance sometimes really is bliss. I'll definitely be bringing this up in my next group therapy session and also my psychiatrist (although she's away now for a month)
