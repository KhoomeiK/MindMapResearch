> ""If the reason you're losing is actual physical behaviour of your teammates, and you *can't address the issue sufficiently* in 5 minutes""


If your teammates are AFKing, own-goaling, constantly centering in front of your net, or ""*actively blocking your shots, blocking your shooting lane, popping the ball over your head, and endlessly stalling you on defence*"", you are playing a handi-cap match at best. 

Solo queueing with someone 200 MMR lower is a cakewalk compared to playing with people who are actively playing against your team because they're stuck in the wrong game mode.  Often, though, those behaviours are paired.

There are a huge swath of behaviours that clearly lose matches for teams.  While it's a nice theory to just ""adapt and carry"" those broken lobbies the reality is that if you can carry like that you're probably better putting that effort into a new match instead of hard sweating and facing the very high probability your teammates throw anyways based on those clearly identified deficiencies.  


So, yeah, adapt.  But for those cases where adaptation non-viable thanks to matchmaking deficiencies?  FF, every time."
RocketLeague,fqufigj,t1_fqtty91,1589658036.0,"> I slip a lot but when I get a teammate who will rotate with me

One of the problems I think people forget in the FF debate is the effect of poor rotations.  

If your teammates are playing with vastly different ideas of possession (for example: playing 2s in 3s), they frequently will be actively blocking your shots, blocking your shooting lane, popping the ball over your head, and endlessly stalling you on defence.  This compresses the amount of time the third man has to work, and often puts them awkward before they commit. 

If the reason you're losing is actual physical behaviour of your teammates, and you can't address the issue sufficiently in 5 minutes (like trying to make 2s work in 3s as a third man not in comms), getting out is probably the best you can do.  Save the tilt for something fixable, IMO."

I would argue that zero drop is 'better' in terms of life, well-being, and proper biomechanical motion & kinisthetics in the sense that you develop a higher degree of functional strength that is in line with our evolutionary design.  Just like I would say that minimal or no gloves are better than wearing gloves that constantly restrict your joint function. I like sprinting with wild abandon on the beach and feeling iron-strong ankles, doing 2k+ of vert and knowing I don't need any 'support', and zero drop has been a massive help to my neck pain, back pain, and posture.  

Better for running though? ... oodles of top tier runners are doing just fine with drop, no one is crushing records because they went zero drop AFIAK, and people who grow up with shoes with drop are adapted to shoes with drop.  Changing in either direction will require adaptation.  You can make anything you chose work, if it's not hurting you.  So bottom line, IMO, follow your heart.

The only major consideration outside of your genuine desires, IMO, would be discomfort and injuries.  IIRC the studies show an equivalent rate of injury with low drop and minimalist shoes, but you see more foot/ankle problems (especially while adapting), and fewer problems with knees and shin splints.

saltierthancrait,fnd9upi,t1_fnd7hw5,1586864080.0,"The vague take on WW2 presented by Star Wars is in no way commensurate with the actual ideologies at play in WW2.

The WW2 of Star Wars is the WW2 of the WW2 movies enjoyed by GL in his youth.  The patriotic notes, jingoism, and ideological dogma expressed in those movies  are laser focused on the superiority of liberal democratic principles.  

The core conflict of Star Wars revolves around a degeneration from a liberal democratic  government into a fascist one, a degeneration with no parallels to the geopolitical situation outside Germany & the primary allied forces.  ""Reich"", as in the ""Third Reich"", is the german word for Empire, and they fought the Rebel *Alliance*.  It's really on the nose.

Also, the unifying forces that motivated the other allied forces to participate in WW2 (far more than just US & UK, btw.... ....), are orthogonal to Russias reasons for entering the conflict.

Also also, conflating the pacific and european theaters of the conflict for the purposes of ideological breakdown completely misunderstands Japans  geopolitical role and ambitions.

So... no.  WW2 isn't about that, and the ""WW2"" Star Wars is copying is even more archtypical."

Just remember that you're using new muscles in new ways, so even ""short"" runs can generate thousands of 'repetitions' of those new motions. It also takes longer to strengthen our tendons and joints strengthen slower than muscles, so it can be a bigger load than one would think.

> Am I going to develop super strong calves now? 

Stronger, sure.  Hiking with load will take them to the next level :)

> Do you think this will give my knee some relief?

Yes, broadly speaking.  IIRC barefoot vs shod running doesn't lead to fewer injuries overall but should move the probability injuries farther down towards the ankles.  

IMO being more attuned to your whole kinetic chain should let you minimize injury risk and potential, but that's as much brains as it is shoe selection."
