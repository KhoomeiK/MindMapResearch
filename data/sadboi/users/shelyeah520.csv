AskReddit,ewsi97z,t3_cpsi27,1565728121.0,"Ok, maybe not super scary, but here goes. When my mom was a teenager she would have to take care of her little brother a lot. So they were at home one night watching TV, it was after dark. I can't remember if she heard something or exactly why, but my mom peeked through the blinds of the window that was right behind their couch... when she did she saw someone else's eyes looking through the window at her! Needless to say they freaked out, but it seemed like the other person did too as they were gone the next time she looked outside. Still gives me goose bumps though!"

mentalhealth,eu261jk,t3_ce4rnd,1563383104.0,"I try to remind myself that a lot of times I feel this way simply because I don't have any good coping methods, so when life is hard, sometimes death seems like the only option. It's not easy, and I'm still struggling with it, but building better coping methods can really help."
namenerds,ets3ygg,t3_cczrgd,1563135931.0,"This happened to my mom, with me. Picked the name Shelby in 1996, because she LOVES Steel Magnolias. Admittedly, that movie is probably why there were so many Shelby's around that time, but my mom was always apologizing to me in high school (I had 6 Shelby's in my grade alone), she said she wouldn't have done it if she had known how popular it would be, but she still loves the name and I do too, so I guess it worked out!"

The paperwork was submitted last month, she is in the clear. Like I said we were trying to get the money together and looking into an appeal. Also thought they may hear us out on our situation, but an attorney told us a few days ago that all we could do was show up to the court and try to talk to them. The hearing was today so now we have 5 days. But she is in the clear I believe."
