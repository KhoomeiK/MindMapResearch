AskMen,fr30gg3,t3_glxcoq,1589847462.0,"Omg same! But I think it's because of society's mentality. For years I've always heard shit like ""you need to go school! You need to study!"", even work isn't acceptable. No you HAVE to attend education -.- But we're not all the same. Dealing with mental and physical health problems most of my life, has been a huge barrier for me to attend school. I'm 24 and I also feel like my life has gone to a waste but that's kinda like saying, I'm gonna be old from turning 26 but I won't accept that. I wanna be young and active till I die. Honestly my advice to you, is to ignore everything people say. Life is not black and white - it's not either this or that! Do what YOU want and what fits YOU and everything has its respected time."
