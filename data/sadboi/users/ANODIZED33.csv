I donBefore this brief call was done, I had written her off as simply not someone I wanted to pursue. 

I think what happened in my case, and in a lot of ghosting cases, is that it’s fun to play the game and flirt and hide behind the computer or phone, but at some point it gets “too real”, and peoples anxieties or doubts set in, or they get cold feet.
