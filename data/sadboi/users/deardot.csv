Even my Mom accused me of being overly dramatic and everyone experiences pain during their periods. 

Only recently (after being diagnosed) have I started to talk to people and boy what a change. My MIL was really understanding and asked if I could inform her on it all, my SIL has had some fertility issues so could relate, and my BFF has had issues with cysts so she could relate. My family doesn't know. And the few people who have dismissed me are on the 'I won't bring it up' list of people but mainly they are people that are more acquaintances then real friends. Still haven't told my family. Probably won't. My brother (who is expecting his first kid) would probably accuse me of trying to steal his limelight..... 

In my experience you are going to come across people who suck because if it isn't something they have experienced themselves they can't seem to relate. I also was diagnosed with ADD which many people tell me that 'everyone has memory problems sometimes and I was just not motivated enough'... I won't tell you what I think of that."

There are many elements of your story that really resonate with me.... I didn't believe I had PTSD until I was almost 30. I had always thought I suffered from an Anxiety Disorder (I have always enjoyed studying Psychology even though it isn't the field of work I am in). 

The best solution for me was to move 14 hours away (which I realize isn't always feasible for everyone) and give my family limited contact since they didn't respect my feelings or requests regarding my childhood abuser. I have considered cutting them off completely (especially since my Grandmother passed), but I haven't quite hit that point yet."

After I moved away from home I had to go to my colleges clinic and they put me on the patch which I stayed on for 10+ years which in my opinion worked much better for me. 

The best and worst thing with birth control is there are so many options.... I hope you are able to get into see someone that at least believes your pain."

Now get away from your desk for 15 minutes. I suggest a walk... Inside or outside doesn't matter, just get up and move. Just don't think about anything that you 'need' to do. Focus on something (sound, smell, texture) just don't think about work.

Now that you have returned start organizing your 'physical inbox' of what can be done or started today and another pile for next week. Email can be trickier but if you have something physical I find it is easier to tackle. 

If anyone comes up to ask you to do something and there isn't anything physical to take from them ask them to send an email and you will get to it once you complete what you are working on currently.

Not saying this isn't super beneficial because being able to identify a feeling, thought, or physical reaction and pinpoint the cause is really helpful, but I haven't found it changed or lessened the impact of my 'triggers'. Especially if he is brought up in conversation (which my family loves to do even though they know) or I somehow see him (or someone that looks like him) in pictures, videos or in-person, which happens often enough as my family are utterly fucking clueless to the feelings of anyone but themselves.... 

With that being said, I am now able to enter a nursing home with my dog (she's a therapy dog) without going into full flight or fight mode which was a gigantic life changing step for me.

No Such Thing as a Fish's Audiobook of the Year (There are 3: 2017, 2018, and 2019).

NSTAAF have a podcast which the book is pretty much an extended version of (so you can take a listen for free before committing... they even have a couple of recent episodes that give samples of the book). Great for the times you need a laugh and don't want something too heavy or only have a limited time to listen. After I have listened to the book all the way through I listen from random points to help me go to sleep when my mind won't settle at night (I've probably listened to the books first two at least 3 or 4 times each at this point so I feel I got my money's worth)."

I also want to point out that you are allowed to feel a certain way about this. Just because she is going through this doesn't mean it negates your own feelings. Be honest and open with her about how worried you are and how that is affecting you. You also do not have to carry her burden. You may also benefit from some therapy yourself so you can unpack things and have a unbiased participant in all this. This might also make her feel more open to the idea of therapy seeing you will also participate (either separately, together, or a mixture of the two)."

I'm self employed so I think of everything in terms of my standard charge out rate of $75-125 an hour (depending on the type of work I am doing). If I have already scheduled time to work on something hardly anyone would be able to convince me to do anything I didn't want to do if it didn't pay me at least my going rate... People do not seem to understand that when you work freelance (or are self employed) you are out $$ for time you aren't working. 

Anyone asking me to change my plans last minute is going to have to give me a really good reason for helping them and because they were so rude to you (24 year old's aren't anywhere near being a child...) it would take an extra incentive to change my plans. 

If they had come to you previously and brought up the idea of helping out with the kids a couple hours a day I would have said you should consider it but I wouldn't feel bad for how they handled this situation. Anyone with 3 kids understands to schedule things better than they did. And depending on the age and activity level of the kids $35 might have been too low."
ADHD,fcue9fv,t3_eitkym,1577978894.0,"I have the absolute delight of having C-PTSD from childhood trauma along with ADD which made life very interesting before I got my diagnoses for the ADD (I almost said earlier this year) in the spring of 2019. I was in constant and sometimes terrifying spirals of depression because I would either become exhausted from trying to overwhelm my senses with things or if I took a moment and 'slowed down' at all my mind would go on overdrive and make me live all those moments all over again at the exact same time..... 

Now that I am being treated for the ADD and being able to look back, my anxiety wasn't it's own thing which my doctor insisted was a separate thing to everything else going on ( I agree I was a overactive nervous child but there was definitely something else going on here)... It was really caused, or at least exacerbated by, the two feeding off of each other and sending me ultimately over the edge. I am finally able to manage most of the intrusive thoughts and keep most of the C-PTSD symptoms at bay. It isn't 100% under control but I am only triggered by very specific things instead of my brain jumping to things that aren't there."
