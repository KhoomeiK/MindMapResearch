Endo,fp94915,t1_fp93ovq,1588413736.0,"Yeah it took me at least 5 doctors to even realize that these pills exist :D

I'm taking Azalia (desogestrel, in case you don't have the same brand in your country). I chose this one because my goal was to get rid of my periods and this seemed like a safe option to do so. I take it everyday (as it's recommended), so I no longer have to worry about extreme pain that always came with my periods. It did cause me some spotting in the first two weeks tho, so definitely talk with your doctor  cause that can be annoying to some people. (I didn't care I was ecstatic that I don't have pain)

I also took provera/Medroxyprogesterone (only the pill form!) for a year which didn't cause any spotting or any side effect for me, and it completely got rid of the bleeding almost immediately. But it only gives around 80% protection (maybe less, not sure) against pregnancy, so that's why I switched to Azalia instead."

I'm asking cause my doctor specifically told me to avoid estrogen with endo, that's why I was surprised.

WomensHealth,fm0zwux,t3_fs3mhh,1585669417.0,"I had reoccurring vaginal tears even though I wasn't a virgin and we had plenty of foreplay. My hormones were simply off. Reoccurring because I didn't wait long enough for them to heal cause I felt guilty and embarrassed for not being able to have sex. Please don't be like me and wait at least 2-3 months before you even TRY to have sex again and ONLY with lube. And stop immediately if there's any pain! 
It's not normal to have pain EVER please don't do this to yourself.

It was a long time for me to get over it. Mostly because as I mentioned I didn't let it heal properly. And when I finally did, the psychological damage was already done, I was scared to have sex again cause I immediately associated it with pain. What helped me a lot is that I (and luckily my supportive boyfriend) tried to slowly show my body that penetration doesn't have to be painful. He would first finger me with one finger and we'd stop if I didn't feel comfortable. Then we moved to two and so on, this way I felt in control again and penetration wasn't a shock anymore.
The key is that you're comfortable enough with your sexual partner to tell him to stop. You have to communicate openly and if he's mature enough, he will support and help you. I honestly can't even imagine how he didn't see that you're in pain. Was he a virgin as well?

ADHD,f762s4o,t3_duh2af,1573422139.0,"I only figured out what works for me after high school, when I wasn't forced anymore to attend boring classes and could experience with my studying methods. So while my methods may not work for you, here are what I do:

1. Write notes while reading. I simply cannot read one page without my mind wandering away. But if I take notes, I'm required to focus, and also it's more interesting task now that I have to find the most important bits to write.

2. Just start whenever and wherever. I know I shouldn't care if my room is messy at the moment, it doesn't matter if I only have 10 minutes until I have to do something else. I just start anyway, I can stop whenever, there's no commitment. This way my brain can realize that it's not actually that hard to start then it originally thought.

3. Minimize the steps it take to study. This is kinda like the last point, basically it's that I always have empty papers and pens on my desk, so I can just grab those and start.

4. Find more enjoyable sources of what you need to study. For me, I noticed I understand things way better through videos than anything else, especially speeded up to maybe 1.5x. Luckily there are a huge amount of videos up on the internet for free, that are made to teach you specific topics. This is a life changer for me.

5. Writing to-do lists. One problem for me is that when I thought of studying, I immediatly got reminded that I have to study for this exam and this homework and this and this... and it was just so overwhelming. Right now, I keep it in my to-do lists, and I only ""have to"" do one thing at a time, it's way easier.

6. It's okay if you can't focus sometimes. Beating yourself up for not being able to focus does more harm than good. It's fine if you have to take a break every 10 minutes, it's fine if you have to read the same page for the third time because you didn't get anything the first two times. Just enabling yourself to not be perfect 24/7 takes away the stress.

amiugly,f73815y,t1_f72zvq1,1573389016.0,"I didn't mean the size necessarily, more like the frame. It's kinda thick and dark so my attention would first go to your glasses and only then your eyes. 

Also, a change of hairstylist for a start? :D Or maybe if you take a picture with you what hairstyle you want, they can help you better."
AmItheAsshole,f7366f8,t3_du9tqd,1573388316.0,"INFO: Did you actually try to help him? Like physically went there and offer help? 

Cause if you were just standing there, talking about how to clean something up (which he obviously knows already and didn't ask for) then holy shit you sound like an annoying person to be around."
AmItheAsshole,f7342id,t3_dua0eo,1573387442.0,"YTA. Let her enjoy things, go do something else while she does that, I'm guessing she doesn't tie you down to watch it."
AmItheAsshole,f733jsz,t3_dua0tn,1573387215.0,NTA. This sounds horrible I'm sorry for you.
Anxietyhelp,f730wt3,t3_dua2eg,1573386025.0,"First off, congrats! 🎉
I've dealt with derealization for a long time, it eventually stopped as I started getting help for anxiety in general. I don't know how much time it took, it wasn't a one day from another really."
AskDocs,f7307m6,t3_dua2pd,1573385690.0,What kind of memory loss are we talking about that it affects your work? Short term? Kinda like how people are when they are high or?
AmItheAsshole,f72yvpe,t3_dua38m,1573384892.0,"ESH but he's the bigger one because of the last parts, he sounds immature af. Just don't share privately sent messages with other people without their consent."
amiugly,f72ydwm,t3_dua3oh,1573384495.0,"You look average to me right now but could improve. Maybe you could change your glasses it looks a bit harsh on you, also try a different hairstyle!"
PCOS,f72xmoa,t1_f71sm1k,1573384016.0,"I was on a smaller dose (500mg) for half a year (with no problem) when I first got diagnosed with insulin resistance with PCOS, but that my new blood test results were still not good enough :( that's why she wants me to take more.
Now I'm thinking that if I only take 750mg without inositol or 500mg+inositol, then that's fine too. But I don't know which one would be more beneficial between those two options :/

But thank you, I'm gonna definitely talk to doctor about it, next time I see her!"
PCOS,f71qjhn,t1_f70gyoa,1573345921.0,"I take myo-inositol in the morning and 750mg metformin with dinner. I've been thinking about cutting it, and taking half in the morning and the other in the evening, but I don't know, does it have the extended release when it's cut half? :/ It's metformin XR"
mentalhealth,f6yudi2,t3_dtmqje,1573298049.0,Happy birthday to youu 🎈🎉
PCOS,f6xokt8,t1_f6xetvm,1573254268.0,"Thank you so much for helping! My doctor first suggested 1000mg metformin alone, but that felt too much so she told me to take 750mg metformin + inositol. I didn't know they work so similarly, then it's not surprising I feel the same as I did with 1000mg. 
My doctor really wants me to increase it even more though... :("
PCOS,f6xo4qt,t1_f6xdjl4,1573253935.0,"Thank you so much for helping. I take it with meals, the dizziness doesn't occur immediately though, I'm just more prone to low blood sugar levels when I take more I don't know why. I'm completely sugarfree and white flour free etc, I usually try to eat meals with high protein and fat.
I take B12 supplement, but not electrolytes, I'm gonna definitely look into that right now. Do you think the lack of electrolytes could be connected to this?"

WomensHealth,f6q3s6l,t3_dskte6,1573070368.0,"There are many different period apps for free, they pretty much all do the same, choose whichever looks good to you. I personally use Clue.

The irregular cycles and spotting before period sounds a lot like the first symptoms of PCOS, did you check that out?

Oh, and the first day of your period is definitely when the bleeding starts, not the spotting."
amiugly,f6q3f2l,t3_dshjv8,1573070163.0,"You're definitely not ugly, you're fine, you kinda look like Matthew Lewis. And huge improvement from your last pic congrats!"
WomensHealth,f5y9muq,t3_dppvqe,1572552872.0,"I totally get you, I've had this too for around 10 years and noone really helped or took me seriously until now. 

I used to be extremely depressed and anxious, often suicidal for at least week before my period. I struggled with panic attacks too. I tried antidepressants, they just made me a zombie, I tried oral bc and while they helped with regulating my period, my mental state got just way worse. Finally a doctor asked me to do a hormone test and it turned out I have estrogen dominance and way too little progesterone. Since then I started taking medication and I feel so much better."
WomensHealth,f5qa9sz,t1_f5pmokt,1572374657.0,"Ooh that explains it definitely! My pms also gets worse during stressful times and if I eat a lot of junk food. But either way if it stays like this even after the stress is gone, definitely ask your doctor about it! It's good to have some control tests anyway :)"
WomensHealth,f5ozho5,t3_dolfcl,1572341230.0,Many things could cause this. Did you have a hormone test recently/before you started taking bc? Or blood sugar/insulin test? Is there any other change that you've noticed or only pms?
WomensHealth,f5a1y70,t1_f5a19ug,1572099021.0,"I wasn't arguing that. I just found the ""your body badly wants a baby"" statement a bit too simple and not necessarily true. Our hormone system is more complex, it's not only about pregnancy. 

Also, if what you said was true, then everyone with PMDD would be magically cured once they get pregnant. Sadly that's not the case, sometimes quite the opposite. Those people are way more likely to have difficulties getting and staying pregnant."
