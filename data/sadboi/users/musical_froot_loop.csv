InstacartShoppers,fo34d7x,t3_g5gc76,1587480321.0,"I think it makes sense for them to limit personal shopping because of the fact that personal shopping delays you getting the customer their groceries. And for all the people who either don’t or can’t use insulated bags any delay means additional time for cold/frozen to come to room temp. 

Would be really nice to be able to grab like one item on the way through the store but they can’t allow something reasonable like that because of all the people who lack common sense or who aren’t conscientious about how they treat people’s food."

InstacartShoppers,fnq7slf,t3_g3azg1,1587159326.0,I’ve seen a lot of posts very similar to this so I think this is a widespread issue.
InstacartShoppers,fnq5c33,t3_g39v69,1587157973.0,"My latest is 60 seconds per item. Back when we had the leaderboard I tried to work faster and do the things you can do to make your time shorter (including but not limited to swiping ready to deliver or whatever that screen says even though the groceries are still being bagged.) It was a silly ego thing but my time was usually around 40 unless something like a deli order was part of the order. 

It’s no biggie if your shopping time is higher than the time Instacart suggests. Sometimes you shop perfectly and something causes a delay. If you can shop that amount of time or less you will make more money. 

Some things that I think help my speed: I constantly am scrolling through the list to catch items that are out of order (produce is often at the bottom and top) including their “preferred products” since those are not in order for the store. I also try to keep walking while I scan items. Most importantly I try not to dither around while looking for a sub, but just pick the best one I can without having to have absolute perfection."

InstacartShoppers,fnpi5a7,t1_fnph8nj,1587145916.0,I know. It astounds me that there are people who don’t have their phone on or near or whatever. When you have an order coming wouldn’t it be the most basic thing the barest of minimums to pay attention to your phone?

InstacartShoppers,fnpe9cx,t1_fnpe42k,1587143977.0,Ok that is even stronger evidence to me that your shopper was up to no good. One item could be a fluke; three items constitutes a deliberate action my opinion.
InstacartShoppers,fnpdusf,t3_g35tyn,1587143776.0,"So you’re comparing the price on the product to the price on your emailed receipt? That’s the assumption I’m starting with. 

As a shopper if I scan a product I don’t have the option at that screen to change the per pound price. Instacart does mark items up but your examples seem excessive. There would be a way to manually enter the data but to do so would require someone intentionally cheating.

I think it is completely appropriate to adjust or even remove the tip. In a better situation, Instacart could give you a resolution in much less time than it is currently taking. 

If those are the only three items you are seeing the huge uptick, my opinion is that the shopper cheated you and the tip should be removed."
InstacartShoppers,fnp196l,t3_g2xx35,1587137454.0,"I don't think you are going to get in trouble, but if I were the customer and I had refrigerated or frozen items that I didn't find until the next morning? I would be very upset. I don't know how customers are managing not to be available on their freaking cell phones for us, so it's definitely partly on the ones who aren't paying attention to their phones, but I don't think I would leave cold items out for them to find the next day. 

What would I do instead? Probably send them a text outlining my choice and my reasoning, take a picture of anything I left, send it to them, and move on."

InstacartShoppers,fnie9o7,t1_fnidw3k,1586978522.0,"No there isn’t a policy against them. And tips within the order really vary. So if you get a cash tip, it is perfectly fine to accept it. Absolutely allowed."
InstacartShoppers,fnie5zm,t3_g1ykyu,1586978473.0,"Generally you won’t want to be waiting for them to unload your bags so whatever your local stores provide is what you should use. 

Also especially right now you don’t want any more contact with customers than necessary. 

We have stores that provide bags for free, stores that charge for each bag, and stores (Costco) that don’t provide any bags. When stores charge, you estimate how many you will need and there should be a screen where you enter the number of bags you’ve purchased. (The customer will be charged.)"

In a perfect world, if someone has to bring a kid they do it safely and thoughtfully. They don’t have their kids run through the store finding products even if that happens to be fun and/or somehow educational. 

In a perfect world, people don’t get all up in other people’s business like the lady taking the photo in order to rattle on the other shopper. 

In a perfect world, we keep to ourselves and do the best job we can. Some of these parents that appear to be clueless may very well be doing the best they can. 

Yep, it’s against the rules. Granted, no kid or non-approved shopper should be interacting with customers. Sure thing, best thing virus-wise is for as many of us to stay home as much as possible. 

It’s a good question OP brings up and valuable when it allows another redditor to learn or reflect or otherwise improve. Bottom line, this job should be about customer service. Is what this parent is doing providing good customer service or not?"
InstacartShoppers,fnc3cgy,t3_g0s7dk,1586827745.0,"Hopefully someone from San Diego will reach out to you. If you can stomach Facebook they often have local Instacart shopper groups and they can give you some specific info about your region. 

The trickiest thing about Instacart is they are so inconsistent. If you hang around here long you’ll see people posting that they are sitting next to another shopper and they receive different batches. Sometimes one person receives batches and the other one receives none. 

Seems like with Instacart for me the best plan has been to expect my customers to be good and decent people, give them and store employees the benefit of the doubt and I’ve the best customer service I can. 

I’m not even sure it’s possible to get an idea of what a typical per hour haul would be in an area. There is such huge variety between batches. And I’m probably way too frustrated with the fact that Instacart seems to thrive on keeping shoppers in crazy town with their policies. 

Customer service for shoppers is hard to find right now. The demand is overwhelming and I think IC has actually done away with the ability to call Instacart. You can only chat with them. 

When I shop I constantly scroll through the list as the list is not ordered from one side of the store to the other. You’ll usually have produce items at the top and the bottom of the list. IC has a new feature called “priority items” where they put a couple items at the top of the list and therefore out of order for the store so you have to keep looking and planning ahead. You only want to go through the store once if possible. 

Store employees are generally very helpful in my experience but if you can learn the layout they’ll like you more if you don’t ask a lot of questions. For my local kroger chain, it’s a good idea to download the app as you can search the app for the store you are in and find a product (sometimes). 

There is a specific way to pay for multiple batch orders and if you just keep your orders separate and identified correctly you should just be able to figure it out at the register. 

With all the app crashes happening I would say screenshot your customer’s address at the beginning of your shop in case the app goes down at the register. 

If your card doesn’t go through, sometimes you can choose debit and the pin is 5454.

In times of COVID19, people appreciate all efforts you make to keep them and their food clean. 

The app will give strange suggestions for substitutions. A general rule of thumb is try to get the same product in a different size and if that’s not possible try to get a similar product. Try to be consistent in subbing organic for organic, conventional for conventional, always sub gluten free for gluten free. 

When I need to make a sub I usually go ahead and sub the item but send a text checking to see if my sub is ok with them. If I do not hear back I go ahead with the sub. You can always refund at the door (or before you take it up to the door if they respond between check out and delivery). 

Don’t give them the receipt no matter what they tell you. They get a receipt from IC or from the store in some cases. At any rate, if I am asked I tell them I do not have their receipt which is true. I have *a* receipt but it’s not their copy. 

I don’t call customers about subs. If you have to call in order to move through the app, just call
and hang up (it goes to IC before it goes to the customer). There just isn’t enough time to take to find out if 99% of subs are ok because if you know how to shop and what constitutes a suitable sub, it’ll be ok. 

Different schools of thought in non-covid times whether or not to ever put groceries inside someone’s home. We only have to take them to the door but there are times when I am glad to take them in. Right now though I leave on porch, take photo as directed and go on my way. 

Can be nice to say hey to customer when you stay shopping and then when you’re on your way. 

It can be a fun job and there are great people. Like anything, there are also stressed-out people especially right now and sometimes we aren’t on our best behavior online or in real life. Sorry again for my earlier comment. This is probably way more than you were looking for but I had to learn a lot of things the hard way.

You might find some good stuff by searching “tips for newbies.”

Things I wish I had known: 

1. You can shop different stores in the same chain if you have a store you prefer. However, currently for online pay for kroger it says you can’t, that the online pay barcode is only for that location. I have my suspicions as to whether that is true but just one more trick IC has pulled. 

2. Doubles are hard to do but occasionally worth it. Triples should never be taken by anyone ever. 

3. Tips come and go. Some people tip well. Some tip poorly. Some don’t tip at all. Try to make sure any batch you take pays you an acceptable hourly wage. 

4. Use the Stride app for keeping track of mileage."
InstacartShoppers,fnber6c,t3_g0s518,1586814236.0,"No one knows.

InstacartShoppers,fn6i6ed,t3_fzvsqb,1586699936.0,"The answer to your question is with Instacart there is a complete lack of consistency and transparency. Shoppers receive almost no training. BOGO is handled differently by different folks. Supposedly BOGO doesn’t apply necessarily with Instacart. 

My solution is I get exactly what the customer requests and ignore the BOGO sign on the shelf. So if you asked for two and were intending to take advantage of the BOGO I would have put two of the item into my cart. If you asked for two and didn’t know there was a BOGO I would put in your cart. I get what the customer requests. 

Unfortunately there is a woeful lack of understanding among shoppers. There is also a vast difference in the integrity of some. There are shoppers that get your two and then pick up two more and keep the extras. 

As you saw there are people who think they are supposed to get you extra. There are shoppers who don’t think about it very critically. And there are some like me who get what the customer requested. 

But I wasn’t sure I’m the beginning how BOGO works and I may have done it wrong the first time or the first few times until someone explained it to me."

InstacartShoppers,fli6wc7,t1_fli6gr3,1585176483.0,"I’m so glad your daughter’s test came back negative! I have a friend with asthma who has a special needs son also with asthma and I know her anxiety is quite heightened right now. 

One thing I have thought about doing next time I go to the store is to take along a stylus I can use on the pin pads at the store."
InstacartShoppers,flhxsea,t1_flhsq80,1585171505.0,That’s the thing! I know there’s money to be made so I am feeling like I’m missing out. And I guess I am! But am also missing out on the risk associated with it that I don’t technically *have* to take on.
InstacartShoppers,flhpgs0,t1_flhp9uw,1585167037.0,I didn’t hear it as complaining! Just a statement of what you’ve been through.
InstacartShoppers,flhongj,t1_flhmn40,1585166600.0,I totally get working when you don’t have any other choice. I’m so sorry you have had such a hard time. I often wonder if there is any possibility of our country doing something other than rewarding the rich over and over and leaving the little guys to fend for themselves.
InstacartShoppers,flhl75d,t1_flhkp2f,1585164766.0,"Yeah, I’m not at-risk but I do have a child with special needs who is more susceptible to infections. Even if this virus isn’t targeting kids, it still feels like I need to stay home. 

I’m definitely not missing the $7 orders but in this past week I’ve seen a number of orders upwards of $50 that weren’t double or tripled or 50 miles of driving. 

Maybe I ought to just turn off notifications all together and stop tantalizing/torturing myself. 

Stay safe, friend."
Jigsawpuzzles,flbt4tk,t3_fnpay7,1585012012.0,I think I’d be able to do the border and then I’d probably give up. This just looks incredibly difficult.
InstacartShoppers,fl9nfeh,t3_fn7u6t,1584963211.0,I deffo hate this “priority” shit because the item is not in aisle order so half the time I forget to pick it up when I’m in the correct aisle and I have to double back. The least they could do is keep it in the main body of requested items as well. The least they could do!
Jigsawpuzzles,fl5lq5n,t3_fmktll,1584839759.0,I see a lot of puzzles on this sub that I wouldn’t want to do but I love this one and just ordered it on amazon.

socialskills,fl5kr0v,t3_fmd3ij,1584839076.0,"Honestly, most of us have so many things asking for our attention all day long that we spend most of our time reacting. 

I know that I often initiate text conversations because texting is a really great means of communication for me. 

But some of my people who are happy to talk for hours only send a few words via text. MANY people mostly respond. 

If you want to be in contact with someone via text, just know that there are many of us for whom we feel like we are always initiating. It’s just part of the way the world works these days. 

I have days where I spend so much time on social media that I don’t really spend any time creating or writing or initiating. It takes intention on my part and the world is clamoring for our attention all the time."
motivation,fl5kdja,t3_fmeq1e,1584838814.0,You are some kind of AMAZING talent. Wow!
ynab,fko945n,t1_fko8nak,1584382533.0,Thank you: you and yours too!
ynab,fknz0sm,t1_fknxz0k,1584376827.0,Yes that is correct.
ynab,fk5t23l,t3_fggh5a,1583887328.0,Wow is that ever cool! I feel like right now a lot of my expenditures are one offs each month but it’s still cool to see how much each of these things costs per day. Those smaller amounts really reinforce how each financial decision impacts the overall picture. THANK YOU!
ynab,fk54eak,t1_fk546n7,1583873251.0,Thanks! I made my first extra payment of $34.44 today! Color me proudly on my way.
InstacartShoppers,fk2bqpy,t1_fk2bo1b,1583797478.0,"Hmm, well i guess I don’t know. I can’t even remember what the hoes batch sound was at this point lol"
InstacartShoppers,fk2bdl9,t3_fg3vaq,1583797238.0,"A notification comes to my phone when a batch has been sitting a few minutes. There is an alert tone or vibration, depending on your settings. I get them all day long. Do you have the notifications switch toggled in the app? It is possible to turn them off, therefore possible to turn them on."
InstacartShoppers,fk1x5jr,t3_ffy9ji,1583788635.0,"Yes that is the problem. She asked for 4 6-oz and I substituted 2 12-oz. Different product, different price. I guess I could have manipulated the numbers somehow but it doesn’t seem like I should have to. 

But my main question was what to do about the item left on the list to complete when SH said they manually scanned the substitutions. Them manually scanning did not remove the item and I couldn’t see any way to get to the checkout screen without removing the original product completely."
InstacartShoppers,fk1o6lb,t1_fk1nrt3,1583783615.0,Indeed.
InstacartShoppers,fk1nm2b,t1_fk1jwj7,1583783284.0,"I *rarely* do. This was a situation where it was ok to do. I thought it through. You know? We decide things in the context that sometimes make sense that maybe don’t to someone who doesn’t have the entire picture. In general, though, I’m with you."
InstacartShoppers,fk1e58f,t1_fk1cph6,1583777825.0,That’s an extremely basic thing that I should have thought of. Although wouldn’t that have messed up the customer’s pricing? I have been thinking that what we enter into the app is what the customer gets charged. Yes? No?
InstacartShoppers,fk1dwjm,t1_fk1dp0a,1583777686.0,Omg IC strikes agains. Ok I’ll keep that in mind for next time.
InstacartShoppers,fk1dq9w,t1_fk1coh6,1583777586.0,"It wouldn’t let me do it manually. Otherwise I would have added it myself. How do you add something without that screen that asks what it is, the quantity and price and whether it has alcohol?"
InstacartShoppers,fjz3336,t1_fjz2rg5,1583710258.0,I think I live in a fairly busy zone.
books,fjot1qw,t1_fjod7t3,1583534254.0,Thought this was a different take than a straight request for recommendation which is why I went ahead and posted it.
