i would definitely advise you to study abroad for a semester (or even a full year if you can) at a place that you dont think you'd get to live/work, even if engineering courses are unavailable overseas (fill em up w bs electives & other graduation requirement).

its one thing to travel as a working professional (most can take off only up to 2 weeks of PTO, otherwise its tryna cram travel in between 2 jobs (my case, got torpedo-ed by pandemic).

USC,fq7gmzd,t1_fq5cikg,1589146137.0,"you might wanna listen to the CSBA above, bc i dont know what engineering's geographic placement is like in general. 

the most common route ive seen are asian international students going back home to their country to work (intentionally wanted a US degree to work back home for more prestigious foreign degree, more fluency in English) and have gone on to places like samsung, etc. 

but if youre a US applicant, you gotta clear the local language requirements usually & then find an employer who'll sponsor the visa.

ive found folks that got banking jobs over seas in Asia (china, hong kong) but they spoke the local language. i-banking recruiting is an uphill process at USC as a semi target. you gotta start early, freshman best, sophomore by latest. 

as for transferring internally within the company in general - as someone who works now, most US companies treat this internal transfer process as a separate job application. of course as an internal applicant, you'll definitely have an edge over external candidates with internal firm references, networking contacts, and ppl to vouch for you on the inside, but its still a sizeable consideration process to undertake. sponsoring a international transfer is costly. 

i dont want to wholeheartedly oversell a USC degree, as once you go beyond the socal region youll see competition from other good schools in those regions outside socal, (and diminishing pool of alumni networks as you go further away). not bc USC is bad, but there are equally strong schools who have regional presence. USC is a great school, but its not the same league as the top tier ivy schools. the difference is where you'll have to make up the ground with networking

if this is a strict USC vs UCSD competition though, you'll have noticeably more opportunity to meet with candidates who want to find work in Asia (or europe for that matter). you'll have to work your butt off w networking to pull it off. but yes, the presence is there for sure. you have to aggressively seize it & work for you. ive seen personal contacts find work in japan & korea & china, but that was their intention from start of school. it may be nice to join some of those international professional student orgs (korean clubs for Samsung etc - have seen a fair # of folks work there). international student clubs have different social cliques you'll have to break in, but again, the presence is there. it would be the same as if you were integrating with social events in those respective countries as an American. 

i had some hs friends who went on to schools like UCSD, UCI, and at these schools many of your peers will be local CA classmates who prolly want to find domestic jobs. you wont hit much international career seeking folks til you get to Berkeley.

foreign firms esp those in Asia value foreign masters - consider one of those progressive masters degrees early on (where you stay another extra year or so for masters).

take active part in social life early in school as a freshman - whether thats going Greek for the presence of international folks, or joining asian/european international student orgs & working your way up the age hierarchy chain (big thing in asia - you chum up to upper classmen, and they take care of you in a loyalty kind of way)."

when i look for qualities in a serious relationship or marriage, there are a few dealbreakers that are super high up on the list that are pretty hard to come across, so her body count doesnt really make it anywhere near the top, whether im her first asian or 200th asian.

for me the list is:

1) how do we feel about kids in the future (being child-free) <- this takes most out, unfortunately. its hard as it is in regular dating, let alone in the smaller yet pool of amwf relationships. 

2) how do we feel about our career growth/trajectory (making sacrifices to go to where each of our dream job is, moving to the job, making sure our relationship is supportive & positive to each others careers). not settling on the career to be content w the relationship, and such. <- pretty reasonable i would say. 

and this a pretty difficult list to find as-is.

next list of qualities would be like: loyalty even thru hardship, etc. not divorcing just bc its hard, or inconvenient. making sacrifices to make each other happy once committed to a long term partnership or marriage. 

and this doesn't even get to my 'ideal types'. like having DARK eyebrows (love the contrast, no preference on actual hair color), having big pretty eyes. 

im also pretty sexual, so id much rather find someone whos sexually compatible w me (kinky, share same kinks, sensual, enjoying the fuck out of it, BDSM, high libido, adventurous in bed, etc), rather than someone w a smaller body count who might not be a fit for me.

im willing to not care about having other qualities matching up, just bc i have qualities i personally find more desirable/important higher up on the list.

i cant imagine a gen 3 being worth 800 in any situation.

id just get a s&w sigma sd9ve or w/e & call it a day, or get an m&p compact for sub-400."

do not shoot your PTR 91/HK G3 with the ejection port facing any of the windows, out of your car.

i saw a post from a guy who shot his  PTR 91 out of the drivers seat facing left side out of his car. the gun flung the brass so hard against the windshield that it cracked pretty bad, at eye level too. windshield had to be replaced as there was no way to seal cracks & restore visibility in a drivable condition."
