Kanye,fl8lx8o,t1_fl8lnd6,1584926746.0,i meant bringing it up as in pre-beef sales. i should have worded it differently though
ConanGray,fl8lkjn,t3_fnbbsw,1584926509.0,i was thinking of rewriting g it from heathers perspective!! this is so cool :)
Kanye,fl8l11n,t1_fl8klgd,1584926145.0,"the famous video featured a replica of her naked body, right next to him, without asking her. pretty weid"
Kanye,fl8js5z,t1_fl8j6bl,1584925311.0,"i do, and taylor didn’t even make music at the time that the college dropout was released. but since you’re bringing it up, fearless sold 592,000 copies in its first week. this is more than tcdo sold. I would give you the statistics for her first album, (which are probably less, since it was her FIRST album)but i can’t find them ahaha"
Kanye,fl8ixf6,t1_fl8iu08,1584924735.0,they didn’t even look alike. i’m ALL FOR a dog at him. but that wasn’t one. why would a hallway be relevant? it’s not.

Kanye,fl8i6p5,t1_fl8i4g3,1584924247.0,i hope you know i was implying that kanye has shitty lyrics-
Kanye,fl8i4ah,t3_fmxao3,1584924204.0,"i mean, i would call people flooding her comments with snake “emojis”, #taylorswiftisoverparty being #1 on twitter, people harassing her an issuer but-"
Kanye,fl8ht7i,t1_fl7pdor,1584924003.0,"grown man who used a wax figure of her naked body without her consent, ran up on stage and said she didn’t deserve an award,ied to and manipulated her, but okay."

there’s also only 2 negative songs *ever* written about kanye."
Kanye,fl8h0mh,t3_fmyuy4,1584923482.0,don’t even try to compare their lyricism-
Kanye,fl8gwni,t3_fn4qzn,1584923410.0,"notice how little kanye is talked about, compared to taylor? and even if he did make her famous, he still shouldn’t have called her “that bitch” which she clearly said she didn’t want?? and he also used a wax figure if her naked body without her consent?? you think that’s okay?-"
