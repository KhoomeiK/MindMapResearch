lately, when I have been photoshooting with it, in daylight or artificial light, when I have something to focus on in the foreground, it automatically focuses on the background. I do use the autofocus of the lens and autofocus of the camera, but that's because I have shaky hands and sometimes fuck up the focus when on manual. it has only been doing this in the last 3 months. does it just need to be cleaned? or is it a sign of a more serious problem?  


Any help would be greatly appreciated."

However, when I got to my interview, I felt relieved when everyone was smiles. I did well on my Japanese test, I feel I gave adequate answers, and I'm always up for adventure. I really hope my two new friends feel like they did well too. 

If JETs wanna get drinks and make friends before, I'm down, just shoot a pm. I'd love to get to meet like minded people like I did today. 

Good luck to all the JETs interviewing!"

teachinginjapan,ffsa9ve,t3_euwn85,1580176949.0,"Could be a questionnaire one day, then a little more info the next. I presume at least some of them read manga or watch movies. Some questions ""if this were you, what would your super power be?"" And ""who would your Villian be?"" ""What would happen if you fought?"" ""What are you fighting for?"" And take that line of questioning. You can make it a little simpler for younger children. The more questions you ask, the more vision you get from their visions. 

I hope this also helps. I am trying to go to Kanagawa, and if you have any questions, I'm more than glad to answer any I can."

From a former JET interviewer (my Japanese Prof at California State University), she said that a lot of people don't get in because of spelling errors and little mistakes in your SOP. Something like 80% of the rejected applicants have these errors. The ones that don't, of them, some get rejected because they ""didn't do enough"" like extra curriculars. So it could be one of those two reasons. Past that, I couldnt tell you. That's all she told us. (Almost the whole class of 30 applied for us, and only 2 got in)"

AskReddit,ezvqlrb,t3_d2mri3,1568191299.0,"10th grade. English class. I grew up in the military, so I was used to being up at 6 to watch the news. I remember seeing the first tower hit and thinking they were shooting some sort of film. That it wasn't serious. Then I got to school. 8am. Class. We watched the news go from ""oh cool a film"" to ""oh my god, thousands dead."" That was the most sobering day of my high school career. Our Valedictorian wrote a speech about that day. It impacted so many of us. Our friends. Our loved ones. 

I will never forget that day."

AskReddit,ezvqcp1,t1_ezvq3qk,1568190871.0,"I met my girlfriend at a cosplay gathering, we talked for a whole year before she asked me to date her. She's a computer science major with a background in computer code and works as a white hat hacker for the local pd. I just graduated university and she still has two years, so on our weekend free, we make plans to visit each other (We live two hours away from each other). We both enjoy just being around each other, so when we are together, we sometimes stay home and watch Terrace House on Netflix, or go out for a day at Disneyland. The only major downside she would say she has is that her body does not contain the enzyme to break down alcohol. Think asian glow but WAY worse, like an allergic reaction that can kill her. So she's literally allergic to alcohol. But that doesn't bother me. When we all go out, she drinks diet coke. :) She's super adorable, fun, kind, smart, and very good with her words. I love her so much."
