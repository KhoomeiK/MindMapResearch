RhodeIsland,fq2nw60,t1_fq2n133,1589057943.0,The point is that you were being petty. Not shocking though.

I went thru bad depression at your age and finally found a medication that worked for me at the time. It literally saved my life. I'm not saying medication is the answer. I know your situation is causing you a lot of depression.

That's something I came to realize as I got a bit older. That a lot of my worst episodes of depression stem from the situation I'm in. Where I'm living, who I'm around etc. I'm sorry that you are away from your parents. My kids are away from me currently and I worry everyday about their depression and anxiety. 

Life can be hard but what you'll learn as you go along, is that nothing is permanent, good or bad. You're at a difficult stage of life emotionally as it is, never mind your family situation and anything else you have going on. What you have to do is look within yourself and envision your future. What do you want out of life? Start taking small but positive steps to get there. 

Soon, you will be an adult. This is all a transitional stage of life that was/is hard for most people. Do not give up. I look back to when I was 13, 14, 15 and all the abuse I put myself thru with alcohol, self-harm and suicidal thoughts. I think to myself, ""What if I really had killed myself?"". I never would've met my husband(just a few months later), we wouldn't have had our children, i wouldn't have experienced all the good times even though there were also many more bad times, these things don't last. We get stronger and you'll will be amazed at how resilient you are. I'm 34 years old, I'm still going through a lot and there have been times I tried to quit life but never without regretting it later. 

Do not leave yet what and who you don't know you'll soon come to love and cherish. There is good in life and I promise you, you will find it."

RhodeIsland,fmts8ps,t3_fxbaeh,1586378109.0,Love this!
ptsd,fmfzczk,t3_fuwzof,1586038027.0,"I'm really sorry :( I get triggered the same way. Luckily, he hasn't been playing many video games.. Definitely have a talk with him when he's not playing and remind him of your triggers and that you can't handle him being on that level when you're locked down with him. It's like torture. Not to excuse anyone triggering someone else but sometimes when I'm sick of repeating myself, I put my ear buds in and leave the room. Watch a show or something funny on your phone or computer etc It's hard to get a mental time out right now. Stay strong."
ptsd,fk6b2kt,t3_fggcfi,1583897606.0,"I was just explaining this to someone the other day. I notice it all the time, too. Before, I'd just blow it off but now it's like torture. I won't even go anywhere alone because I feel like one day I'm gonna lose my shit on some guy who's being a pig. I feel your pain."
