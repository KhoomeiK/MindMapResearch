offmychest,f0czogk,t3_d4iy6c,1568547448.0,Yea it’s pretty scary honestly. We just try to be as honest as we can with him and talk to him about the things we don’t want him watching. And we don’t use technology to babysit him. The only way I let him use my phone is the camera. He loves taking photos and taking videos of himself talking and giving tours.  He thinks he’s talking to his “followers”. Then I’ll post the videos in private so he can watch them on tv. It’s pretty funny. Games I try to play with him. And I keep a really close eye on the YouTube history.  He spends time watching other kids play videos games which to me is mind numbing. I’ll never understand Minecraft.
offmychest,f0cu5e6,t3_d4iy6c,1568545320.0,I agree with this. It is loaded with some really shitty stuff aimed for kids. I have a 5 year old and we have to be very careful.
