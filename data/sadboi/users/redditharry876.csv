AdultChildren,f39le7p,t3_dg594b,1570750515.0,"Wow my situation is super similar. Especially the weed and sex part. I guess they both just help me dissociate from all my problems. And my friend pointed out to me that almost every 10 weeks of this year I have dated some different guy. I can’t figure out how to fix my relationship issues. I was in an emotionally, verbally and eventually physically (we ended shortly after the physical abuse started fortunately) abusive relationship on and off for 5 years. I had no idea of my self worth and looked to him for validation because i was never really validated growing up. My parents would be too busy arguing over money problems. During that relationship I started going to therapy and getting rid of him was one of my biggest break throughs but now I am trying to figure out how to break the victim mindset. 

My mom and dad both drank and argued more nights than not for as far back as I can remember, and I am 26. My dad is a lot better than my mom because he smokes weed as well so doesn’t drink as much and gets aggressive way less frequently than my mother does. My parents hate each other most of the time, so I don’t know how to navigate a functional relationship because they’ve been my main example. I can even acknowledge that when I am in an argument I tend to talk over people excessively (I rarely argue with people though- except my mother). 
My mom drinks a lot, the other day she drank 2 bottles of wine the other day and went crazy, crying hysterically, she is depressed but “doesn’t believe in those things” and self medicates with alcohol. It used to be vodka, made my childhood/teenage years hell. She eventually started to get so black out on vodka she scared herself so has now reverted back to wine. She is trying now to read up about mindfulness and has started working again but definitely don’t want to get too hopeful too soon. 
Having a bad relationship with my mother has made me feel like a bad person since I was a teenager.. she treats me A LOT WORSE than my sisters. My psychologist says it’s because She sees herself in me and doesn’t like herself so attacks me. I have just recently stopped blaming it on myself because like you I have great friends and great siblings. 
Also could you send me the link to the conan obrian podcast you listened to, been wondering which episode to start with for his podcast, was looking for a good one.

Anxiety,f39hzrw,t1_f39auqp,1570748382.0,Yep exactly..  I do try and force myself to do it more but I guess it goes back to self worth and a history or not being able to express and validate my emotions (alcoholic mom..) still makes me feel like I am not worthy of that. But I am trying

Unfortunately this is how bad my day felt like today was one of those dreaded days, grateful that it’s over though, had a mild panic attack but made it through. Tried my hardest to focus on something I was grateful for, one being that I never have to re-live this day again and that it’s over and some other stuff and tried to focus on that and meditate.

I prefer cera ve products a lot more to olay, those moisturizers contain things like scent that can really irritate the skin.

AM Moisturizer: TO Moisturizing factors + HA is great / FAB face ultra repair first aid moisturizer

Sunscreen - SO IMPORTANT !!!! - I use FAB sunscreen, but might be too much for your skin if it's oily. EltaMD is excellent but pricey, could try. Australian Gold Botanical Sunscreen (face) is a good affordable option. 

PM: 

Face wash: double wash - same cerave cleanser as AM

Toner: you can use your toner, glycolic acid toner from TO is a good starting point to those oily acne prone/black head spots, don't use on dry spots - might irritate skin to use every night so if you feel like your skin is extra oily tone, or you can do it 2x a week to start

Serums: can use the same as the AM, if you are worried about wrinkles can try mild retinol/retinoid type cream but MUST use SPF the morning after. you

Serums: can use the same as the AM, if you are worried about wrinkles can try mild retinol/retinoid type cream but MUST use SPF the morning after. 

Moisturizer: can use same AM moisturizer, also a cheap great option is cerave night moisturizer - LOVE IT, great for acne prone skin too because it is not too heavy (much prefer it to their AM one tbh)

You can do AHA BHA peel from TO once a week (preferably in the evening - try not to go into the sun after or just do it at night) - so you cleanse as per usual do your peel then do serums, and moisturizer 

You can do aztec clay mask occasionally when your skin is oily as well, but don't do it on the same day as the peel or close to the day you did the peel, not trying to dry out your skin"
Skincare_Addiction,f25m2f8,t3_dc0j7t,1569977973.0,"hey so I have been helping my friends and sisters with this same issue. I think theOrdinary is the best and most budget friendly starting point. 

Blackheads on your nose and chin - try chemical exfoliation, supposed to be helpful in clearing pores, AHA and BHA peel by the ordinary is excellent, and their glycolic acid toner would do well on those oily and black head prone spots. 

Niacinamide is an excellent product, it is great for reducing redness, shrinking pores, and reducing wrinkles 

For the dry spots you could get theOrdinarys hyaularonic acid is great, you can also try their moisturizing factors + HA for a moisturizer (I am currently using First Aid Beauty's (FAB) moisturizer, but its 4x the price of the ordinarys, both are good so you could buy within your budget. 

mamonde is also one of my favorite K-Beauty brands and they have easy starter kits 

Also best youtube channel for all your skin care needs if you're in your 20s is beautywithin, I watch them lots. 

Face wash: Gentle and affordable - can NEVER go wrong with CeraVe, since you have oily skin I would recommend using their foaming cleanser. 

AM Serums: Hyaularonic Acid + Niacinamide good options, safe to use in the AM - both the ordinary and glossier have great ones"
