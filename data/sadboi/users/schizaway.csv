I went over my calorie limit a few times last week however, but I'm gonna try harder to keep the numbers steady at 2000 calories or a little less this week. Got to up my water intake and I think that will help too!

This week I'm starting an intermittent fasting regime of 8/16 too, and train myself not to graze all day! Just eat at my specific times."
