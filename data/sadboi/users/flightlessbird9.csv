TalkTherapy,fqqkd47,t3_gjg2yf,1589567044.0,I‚Äôve been with the same therapist for nearly 2 years now. And I only ever email him about appointments or insurance questions and I have only texted him once to see if I could get a earlier appointment bc of things going on in personal life I wanted to sort through. Other than that I feel as if I burden people so I don‚Äôt contact at all outside the office.

therapy,fozomqc,t3_g9z8de,1588194167.0,"So you‚Äôre basically here for validation and for people to bash your therapist. Respecting boundaries goes both ways. Spam calling her isn‚Äôt only disrespecting her but disrespectful to other clients or anyone else who‚Äôs time is consistently being interrupted by you. Therapist are people too, they have lives and you can‚Äôt expect her to drop her life for you. Boundaries are safe and they are healthy, I literally only contact my therapist outside the office for insurance questions and appointment rescheduling. They‚Äôre time is valuable too and being that extra takes away from them and any other potential clients. Your actions have consequences as well, you are not exempt from that, and being reckless with boundaries could result in your termination as a client. So if you really do like her it would be in your best interest to respect her boundaries."

EatingDisorders,fn1ry2y,t3_fypjqd,1586568711.0,Don‚Äôt beat yourself up... many don‚Äôt know the proper way to handle these things... encourage recovery... remember that baby steps are still steps... nearly everyone in recovery has some minor relapses don‚Äôt beat anyone up over it if she‚Äôs not ready for recovery yet help her practice mindful eating... there‚Äôs plenty of things you can do to help WITHOUT forcibly bringing up food... routines help as well... :) I‚Äôm not a clinical professional these are all things I learned in residential treatment and IOP.
TalkTherapy,fmlw6xw,t3_futkdt,1586194339.0,"My therapist recommended I go to see a dietician because that was not a specialty of his. And from there I authorized communication between the two of them about the best possible treatment approach. After much discussion THEN residential treatment was suggested. Most of that stuff depends on where you stand medically, if they feel as if you can be treated without jeopardizing your health they will. However if your symptoms have been prolonged sometimes it‚Äôs a danger to yourself to be treated without 24 hr supervision. At that point then residential is the best option, which isn‚Äôt always like a hospital setting. They‚Äôre often times nice homes that house about 10-20 people."
TalkTherapy,fmg2uei,t3_futko4,1586040085.0,"A eating disorder is when you meet diagnostic criteria. Like I was labeled under disordered eating until I was officially diagnosed with A.N. Restrictive subtype

But IMO I think it is all something to be taken serious because diagnosis or not it can take a serious toll on your health and can/will eventually cause your body to  deteriorate. Stay safe."
TalkTherapy,fm9zlga,t3_ftia82,1585880211.0,"I would just keep it professional if it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs going to help it needs to be said. 

On another note:

I‚Äôm currently a eating disorder patient and one of the side effects is amenorrhea (skipping menstrual cycles). As we were filling out my admissions paperwork for residential treatment one of the questions was if I had amenorrhea. I answered and was immediately followed with, ‚Äúis there any possibility you could be pregnant?!‚Äù To which I answered, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even have the energy for physical activity much less sexual activity‚Äù it was a good laugh.

I wish you luck in your healing journey"
