I only know from experience that these things usually make me happy. I going to reword it because it's slightly confusing but, I do get that satisfaction, that is what makes me happy. The knowledge that I'm improving and that task can get ticked off. 

I just wanted to know if it was common to experience 'absolute bottom pit feeling' when settling into a routine. Do you by any chance know a way to stop expecting too much from a routine?

 Thank you so much for replying I really appreciate it!   :)"

It also depends where you are, some places have brilliant sky's to photograph.

I'm obviously not 100% on this, I just thought I'd add my understanding of it :D

TrueOffMyChest,fldtxsq,t3_fo6pqj,1585071649.0,"Non of what you said was stupid, non of it came across as you being incompetent. It sounds to me like anxiety is ruling your life and that's totally understandable and I relate because anxiety is a bitch. You are not alone, I have definitely struggled with the exact same thoughts and it sucks, it's so infuriating when you feel like you have no control over your life and that there's no joy in anything because you're too scared of everything.

Believe it or not I also spent a large portion of about 4yrs maladaptive daydreaming as a coping mechanism for my own issues. I think it's stated that it only becomes a problem when it's stopping you from living your life.

Do you tend to be a perfectionist, you are scared of having any result that isn't perfect and so you don't try at all? Idk if this ties into your anxiety because it does for me and any advice I would give you might seem shallow and half-assed but how I personally combat this is by giving yourself space. Space allows you to forget the relativity of your project, it allows you to take a look at how you are doing and practice self care. I know it seems like you are stuck and there is no way out of your situation but if you take a step back and look at life as a whole, there are so many paths to take, you could literally do anything. it helps to remember that there isn't a time limit, everybody is different and learns things at different speeds. If you haven't gotten it today there is always tomorrow, like the saying ""practice makes perfect"" it doesn't mean you've failed. Your life doesn't belong to anyone else, not your family, not your friends, it's yours and yours alone. You have the power and right to tell them it takes time, you shouldn't have to struggle under overbearing expectations from others or yourself. You can still please your family and challenge yourself but it shouldn't cost your happiness and mental well-being. You have the right to set boundaries.
Maybe it won't be a clean procedure and you'll make countless mistakes along the way but you will make it and come out on top.

 Another thing to try is being mindful of the way you treat yourself, I don't want to assume anything and correct me if I'm wrong but I imagine you are very hard on yourself. There is a trick for this, it's something like you think of a friend or a family member and imagine criticising them the way you do to yourself. Usually it helps you recognise the impact of the things you tell yourself, another method of this is to question every harmful thing you think, for example: 

Harmful thought - ""I'm such a failure, I can't do anything right!"" 

Method - ""why am I a failure?""

Harmful thought - ""I keep messing up this simple task""

Method - ""that's just the process of learning, I shouldn't compare myself to others""

I think you should find someone you trust and spill the beans, talk to one/ more of your friends about everything. It's incredibly helpful to have dialogue with people and I'd imagine they wouldn't be against helping you out, they'd probably jump at the chance to help someone they love. But remember if things don't pan out the way you expected, people don't react the way you'd expect, don't let it impact you. Don't let it turn the tide and you go back to thinking you are a failure. All you need to do is remember you are not alone, we are strangers to eachother and yet we have experienced the same thing, I and countless others have got your back :)"

This loop usually triggers my procrastination which also sucks. But y'know if you want some advice, maybe try taking a break from your task, talk to someone (if you're doing a project and you have to have it done by a deadline maybe contact someone involved like a teacher/ supervisor or fellow peer and let them know about your struggles). Bare in mind I don't know your situation so perhaps you just want to vent but in my experience talking to people face-to-face really helps."
