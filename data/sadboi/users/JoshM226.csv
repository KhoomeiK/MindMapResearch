Is there still a path for a replacement candidate?  If so who do you think would be most electable?  Tulsi?"
politics,fqodvzb,t3_gk1g9m,1589513050.0,"Did anyone else see this?  It was hard to watch Biden struggle through every response.  I don’t think he even wants to be president at this point, but doesn’t have a good exit strategy.  Is it too late for a replacement candidate?  Who would be electable in the party?"

publix,fqedxpw,t1_fqcdz0k,1589305961.0,I recently had an ASM manager that thought it was pointless when I asked him about an item movement report.  He was a very frustrating person to work with.

publix,fqbkkkk,t1_fqbk6kf,1589238720.0,"I do my own forecasting so I have that down.  Display planning I have not done.  We are an older store, and our frozen section doesn’t have an ad display.  That’s what I’m worried about.  I know I’m good, but training others especially when they’re not “getting it” without getting frustrated, and beating myself up about it - is that a learnable skill?"
NewYorkMets,fpuhu03,t1_fptdkqp,1588913275.0,Seriously.  Wilpons are the worst.  Take the money and move on.  OR don’t sell until you are ready to release control.  “Jeff won’t know what to do with his time if he isn’t in charge of the Mets”. Give me a freaking break.

publix,fpptr94,t1_fppg3os,1588808986.0,What??? That is way too much!  Is someone actually working them and fixing counts and masc?  We have one bird lately and usually is only about half full.

publix,fpbbaci,t1_fpb97vc,1588466124.0,The directions state that adding water is optional at a 1:1 ration.  Either way it basically freezes on contact and forms a thick slush that is very difficult to remove.  My best tactic was to let it dry/freeze completely and slash at it with a broom until I can get it out of all the grooves.

For me, it’s like I’m completely shocked by the other persons reaction, until the mania fades and then I’m like ohhhhh and torture myself with regret for the next many decades.  That is what makes this illness so unfair.  We think we are doing the exact right thing, even when it is the exact wrong thing."
