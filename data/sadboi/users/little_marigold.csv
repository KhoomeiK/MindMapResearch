The It Cosmetics brow pencil is really good but it can be a little too firm and is hard to get thin, defined lines. but that's what makes it stay so long i guess!!"
BeautyGuruChatter,fqgqcbj,t1_fqgnmz2,1589353688.0,"agreed. for as long as i can remember now, it's just been unboxing after unboxing. i just meant that, regarding fake lashes vs not, she's a youtuber that i like bc she does looks from the unboxings that usually don't use fake lashes!"
BeautyGuruChatter,fqgfols,t3_gipnrz,1589345076.0,"Alexandria Ryan on youtube is great if you hate false lashes because she does too!! her channel is like 95% subscription unboxings but she always does try-ons of all the products. she has admitted that she's bad at lashes and/or doesn't like wearing them, so she almost never wears lashes in her youtube looks! the only unfortunate thing is, because it's all subscription unboxings, you would only be able to follow along to her eyeshadow tutorials if you have that box or specific palette. nevertheless, i appreciate her for being different than everyone else who needs to use a lash to complete the look!"

Makeup,fmdi285,t1_fmcs05y,1585968366.0,"double wear was kind of a heavy foundation on me. it's definitely a beautiful full coverage but not typically what i think of when i hear ""light.""

if you can find a form of exercise that you enjoy, latch onto that!! i like weightlifting so that's what i do at the gym but find your thing, whether that's running, cycling, swimming, etc or even just walking. every bit of movement helps!"

it's scary not knowing what aspects of our lives the virus will impact next. i'm very thankful that i could move back home if i didn't land a job due to a dip in the economy, but i'm worried for my fellow graduates too."
Makeup,fkpnwo6,t3_fjvreo,1584414685.0,honestly i've been loving the clinique pretty easy liquid eyelining pen and it's actually a brush tip (which i thought i hated) but it works SO well and performs just like a felt tip IMO. and it lasts a really long time. i was stuck on felt tip eyeliners until i tried that!! but the urban decay precision felt tip liner and the fenty eyeliner are good too if you are looking to stick with felt. i thought stila dried up kind of fast compared to others i've tried!
MakeupAddiction,fk6e1tm,t3_fgpman,1583899654.0,"i use the sephora brand solid brush cleaner! cheaper than the beauty blender brand and works just as well. i like that you can wet the brush and swirl it on the bar of soap, then transition to washing the brush with your hands, mat, etc whatever you prefer. it also lasts a really long time!!"
beauty,fjj4aw6,t3_fdneij,1583382973.0,"i'd say stick within the 6 month window, especially if you use mascara every day. a lot of bacteria can get into the tube and you risk irritating your eyes, getting an infection, etc if you keep it for too long.

as for mascara recommendations, i recently tried out the new fenty beauty mascara and it really lengthened my lashes and definitely held a curl!! not much volume in my opinion but sooo much length + curl"
architecture,fj5de0d,t3_fbmjb7,1583030003.0,"i'm a senior interior design student and we work very closely with the architecture students in our department. architecture is definitely a lot of work - for the first two years we all did the same projects, and i can tell you that there were a lot of late nights. i was in studio at least six days a week. it takes a lot of hard work and dedication.

i also have a graphic design minor, so a lot of similarities between us lol and it ultimately comes down to what you're most passionate about. depending on the school you attend, you could maybe go the route of major/minor between the two if you're truly on the fence about it. you can definitely make a bigger career out of architecture, but keep in mind that you'll most likely need to go to grad school as well (unless your program is 5 years) to become a licensed architect!"

just a thought :) not all relationships are doomed if you care enough about them

BeautyBoxes,fi3panj,t1_fi39pxw,1582124688.0,"true, i've received so many samples from sephora that are laughably small and i'll get literally 1 or 2 uses out of it. i keep telling myself that it's fine bc they're expensive brands but allure (and ipsy tbh) manage to give you larger samples of the same products. thanks for the insight!"

beauty,fgcdm8m,t3_exqt8f,1580671658.0,"eyebrow pencils are really great for creating extra ""hairs"" in your brows for a more natural look! i would say powders and pomades give a bolder look than pencils, with a pomade being the most drastic - great for carving out those ""instagram brows"" that showed up a few years ago.

don't know much about different wands for brow gels, it shouldn't really make a difference imo. some gels are tinted though, which is another good option for natural-looking brows. personally i use a pomade and then clear brow gel to set mine."
beauty,fehiwzw,t3_ep709m,1579117470.0,"i tried it on both my eyebrows and eyelashes and no matter how carefully i applied it on my lashes, it always ended up getting into my eyes and it burns a little lol. brows seemed to work okay though? i think the hairs got a little thicker/stronger and my brows started to fill in. haven't used it in a while though just because i forgot, and i didn't see a big enough difference to motivate me to keep using it"

urban decay all-nighter setting spray is a miracle on oily skin!

clinique pretty easy eyeliner pen!

i don't have ""holy grail"" products for much else though; my preferences change over time and i'm not stuck on a single product. if you're looking to overhaul your makeup stash and get a lot of new products (especially for face), sephora's website has mascara/lipstick/foundation quizzes where you can answer a few questions and they'll recommend products for you!!"

nothing wrong with read receipts imo"

i know you said his love language is quality time, but you can also try sending him little care packages or letters to let him know you’re thinking of him when physical closeness isn’t an option - that goes a long way and it’s always heartwarming to receive something like that in the mail when you aren’t expecting it!"
