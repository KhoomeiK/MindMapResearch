BorderlinePDisorder,fkjsm7r,t1_fki35tk,1584257808.0,"I'm so sorry to hear that dear. I can't even imagine what pain you must be going through. That's like the greatest fears of all. Your FP leaving you, especially without any closure. It must hurt terribly. But the fact that you've been facing it and standing tall even though it's causing you moments of vulnerability is really brave and commendable. You are so strong. 

There's no denying that this whole experience is very traumatic. It would be even for a person who doesn't have BPD. No one deserves to be left like that no matter what. I don't understand why they did this. I hope they are okay too. Maybe they had their own demons. If this was simply because of you, they'd cut you out off your life and not just everyone. Cutting off from family is not a easy thing to do. So, if they are kind of missing from everyone, chances are it's not because of you, but because of something they personally went through. Either in the mind or god knows what. Did you report this to the police? If you've not, I really think you should. The most you or his family can do at this moment is try looking for them. Maybe they need that too.

I listen to Dr Daniel fox every night before sleeping. Just play his videos and plus the headphones in and let his voice and words calm me so that I start the next day with much positivity. He truly is amazing and I wish he could have been my doctor irl."

It's very exhausting indeed. Ig we are too used to pouring all our anger out that now we don't know what else to do with it. My DBT workbook tells me that I should channelise it somewhere else. It's a very hard thing to do because when I'm angry, I just want to hurt the one who made me angry. I don't want to do anything else. We still have a lot to learn and a long road ahead. I've heard that it's not impossible so hope is still there.

Thank you I didn't get triggered by your advice. It was incredibly helpful. I just want people to keep advising me all the time because I'm just too bad at life with my BPD. :D"

BPD,fjgiod6,t3_fdchku,1583327729.0,"I'm in the same boat. What I've been doing is fighting every urges to split on my partner or even friends for that matter. Which is very very hard. On most days, I end up crying because of how difficult the struggle to not split becomes. I've told my partner and he has been being very patient and understanding. You should tell your partner too.

Other than that, I've the DBT 911 app on my phone and sometimes it helps me during distress. I'm also maintaing a DBT journal where I track down my moods and behaviour or anything 'evil' that I did. Then I read it the next day and the guilt itself stops me from making the same mistakes again. Basically puts some sense into my head. I'm also reading DBT workbooks and practicing them. (Not daily because I'm lazy) But it helps too.

Oh, also, anytime you get the urge to do something bad or hurt someone, just leave the room. Or your phone. Wherever you are talking to them. And distact yourself for at least 5 minutes. Works wonders"

Know that there's a difference between what you know and what you are thinking. You know he loves you and that's a fact. But since your BPD has the tendency to overpower you, you'll think and feel he doesn't. What I do is I let him know how I'm feeling. And he always makes me feel safe and sound. It's better and a healthy approach to talk it out with your partner and make them understand what's going on in your head. Don't overdo it though. There has to be a limit.
