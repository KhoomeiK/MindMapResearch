ptsd,fmbm8yx,t3_fu38o3,1585929115.0,"Definitely a psychiatrist because they can assess you and diagnose you formally. Once you have the diagnosis, they can refer you to a psychologist for therapy and maybe give you some meds to help with symptoms. 

I'm in the UK and it goes: GP to refer to psychiatrist, psychiatrist to diagnose, medicate (if necessary) and refer to psychologist. Psychologist to assess and refer to the most appropriate form of therapy. It can be quite long-winded. The main reason for that in the UK is because it's all funded by the NHS, unless you can afford to go private. So, there are really long waiting lists. I had to wait a year and some people have to wait 18months. But when I finally got the therapy, I had it for a year and it has been really beneficial. 

There is the option of going to GP and getting counselling through them (without going to a psychiatrist), but in the UK, you only tend to get about 6 sessions doing it this way and that's often not enough. And they're also counsellors who might not be well equipped to deal with trauma. 

Basically, the first step is your GP. 

Good luck on your journey to recovery and stay strong."
