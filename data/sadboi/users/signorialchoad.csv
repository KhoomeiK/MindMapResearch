It took Zyprexa alone about 6 weeks to fully dislodge me from my ‚Äúprojects‚Äù when I was in a situation very much like your brothers.

bipolar,fgrq1jv,t3_f05fy6,1581053746.0,"If you consider the year leading up to the weeks of your mania, can you make out pronounced and escalating (in intensity) upswings, episodically alternating with neutral or down-inflected periods?  I ask out of curiosity, bc the overall texture and even some specifics of your trip mirror mine powerfully.  I was so steeped in spiritual literature at the advent of my hallucinatory breakthrough‚Äî and the timing was so fortuitous, with a spiritual awakening culminating 12 steps of recovery‚Äî that it felt absolutely like transcendental deliverance, relief from the bondage of self and a merging onto a mystical frequency . Def could communicate with the dead, and was hyper-attuned to a vivid electricity animating everything.  Was in love with the world.   It‚Äôs being a bipolar baddy, but I do sulkily wish, everyday, in the midst of this earthly depressive hangover, to go back into that strange transdimensional vortex, even if briefly, even if I didn‚Äôt make it back.  I went to the hospital voluntarily on day 2‚Äì I really wish I‚Äôd been less agreeable and waited at least until things got more menacing.  I was meditating in a rose garden before being committed as a 5150 and drugged perforce‚Äî things got scarier, then."
bipolar,fgqwx8x,t3_ezzqum,1581033217.0,"I remember indulging in this lil reecho tendency during a pretty delusional spell of mania, as if I was confirming some locution of mine with the alien sounding-board of a Great and Guiding Other.

BipolarReddit,fgql14x,t3_ezu7y3,1581026224.0,"I took a 1 yr sober cake at an AA meeting on 10/19/19.  During the meeting I noticed I was taking increasingly deep and increasingly unwilled breaths, and suddenly, instead of being in my body, I was hovering overhead, and felt like I‚Äôd been dosed with maximal hits of LSD and MDMA. I was weeping, and utterly lacked self-consciousness; for contextual reasons, it was easy to imagine what I was undergoing was ‚Äúthe spiritual awakening‚Äù  promised by the 12 steps of AA. I walked outside and fell forward onto the ground in an ecstatic rapture. Someone came out and got me and told me to get myself together, which I managed to do, returning to a normalish baseline, though feeling a little stunned and a little sick.  Later at home I deliberately breathed into the experience again, and this vaulted me into full-blown metanoia,  an experience of almost unbearable physical sensuousness (which humming or chanting gave voice to), fearlessness and extremely complex conceptual patterning making sudden sense of all the unresolved dendritic branches of my life.  I made a few unsettlingly songful phone calls to family and friends, alerting them to the discovery, in my consciousness, of the end of suffering.  I went to sleep for a little while, and woke up the next day, calmed but uncannily altered, lucid, with a benevolently reassuring sense of being held and guided.  The morning and early afternoon of 10/20 were the most beautiful hours of my life‚Äî I walked the beach reciting long forgotten poems from my adolescence, sat in a church, and spent a couple hours with a friend and her two babies.  There was a distinct sense of having awakened from a lifelong dream‚Äî I was suddenly for the first time wholly myself, which paradoxically felt like the vanishment of selfhood, a coruscant and expansive merging into oneness, no fear, no agenda, no defensiveness, no self-seriousness, just an openness and a giddy, surging love for the living world. Because of how strangely I had sounded the night before my fam wanted me to go to the hospital, which I did voluntarily to assuage them.  After I had been fraudulently 5150d and drugged‚Äî I had never been less inclined to violence in my life‚Äî the most beautiful day of my life became a darkening hellscape of terrifying delusions and institutions.  It‚Äôs probably poor and predictable form for a neophyte bipolar to mourn his first big mania, and perhaps I am lucky to have been treated so early on, before I became an inevitable liability.  Against this reasoned stance it remains the most painful regret of my life, having allowed the interruption and medicallzafion of that experience‚Äî something deep and knowing in me hungers to have seen it through, against any wiser judgment, and the hankering doesn‚Äôt feel selfish or bliss-seeking, but rather connected to some immemorial vatic quest.   I believe the frequency of consciousness some of us attune to, in mania or love-addled psychosis, is at the heart of the history of spiritual gnosticism and religious ecstasy; but making ourselves sane and useful to loved ones, for the short time we share together here, is arguably the more spiritually sound recourse.  I can‚Äôt reclaim the innocence/ignorance that undergirded and galvanized my first episode, so I‚Äôm not actively seeking a 2nd‚Äî but I‚Äôve been lost and impossibly rueful since, and would give my life, perhaps, to go back."
bipolar,fgo5axp,t3_ezleop,1580960132.0,"For sure‚Äî because wasn‚Äôt it yourself doing it before too, however dopaminergically enhanced? It‚Äôs hard to settle into the subdued lineaments of a stabilized life after having had before those intermittent bursts of basically effortless industry.  This settling is easier, is kind of mandated in cases where bipolar has catastrophically disrupted someone‚Äôs life‚Äî makes it easier maybe to not long for the haphazard, ecstatic rhythms of an unmedicated experience.... I‚Äôm still hanging on, for dear life sometimes, to the possibility of the latter.  For nearly everyone it seems like prioritizing stability is the sine qua non of recovery, which involves the ambient dampening you describe. Maybe it is some consolation to acknowledge that any career-related innovations made during an hypomanic spell would probably require preternatural effort to sustain through a depressive one, and that the professional world isn‚Äôt jiggered to accommodate the parabolic vectors of bipolar.   Your progress now may be slower, more plotting, less luminous, but over time will likely accumulate a dependable logic and density.  Best of luck."

A few precautionary guidelines, addressed to future self. for navigating spiritual emergency


Spend as little money as possible. Gamify this frugality if you must, go overboard scrimping.  You are definitely broke, and not in a position to be charitable or enterprising.  

Remember that everything your family does for you is based in love and a fear that grows out of love. Always tell them where you are. 

Write, but do not publish.  Record, but do not post.  

Eat, sleep.  Drink water. 

You do not drink or use drugs.  Don‚Äôt smoke cigarettes, not even sympathetically‚Äî in fact, your impulse to join in, to join crowds, to peer in on parties, should be cautiously reconsidered whenever it perks up. 

You are not a smarter version of the person authoring these guidelines‚Äî if you must, think of these as being sent back from a future you survived into. 

Do not contact old friends/teachers, especially not with new collaborative ideas. Especially not her. 

Listen more talk less‚Äî listen more, interpret less. 

Music, not podcasts.  No TV.  The news isn‚Äôt for you.  

Sure, become an Instapoet. 

‚ÄúThe illuminati‚Äù is likely a network of small-time mercenaries in central Asia.  That last time you breathlessly lit candles, arrayed and kneeled upon ornate textiles endeavoring to join/infiltrate them, is nothing to sneeze at, psychosis-wise.  Do not send anyone abroad money. How they seemed to know last time you were manic‚Äî i.e. ideally prepped to believe in your own lucrative chosenness‚Äî is indeed strange. The world is indeed strange, but conspiratorial speculation leave to cooler tempers.  

Conserve and subdue your bliss with breath, and keep it to yourself. It will alarm most everyone else.  Not everyone who  isn‚Äôt alarmed should be welcomed into your life intimately.  You will attract strange birds.  

Acknowledge that if cheeky prophylactic instructions like these significantly curbed true psychosis, outcomes would be a lot rosier, and interventional treatment less commonly necessary.   However, a self-fulfilling and self-affirming prophecy is that this will help you. 

Accepting that you can‚Äôt slow down your thoughts slows down your thoughts.

If meditation is uncomfortable, love the discomfort‚Äî if meditation is impossible, try walking meditation, try gentle chanting. Remember that you are essentially gentle and you are essentially humble.  Try out the shallow part of the ocean to ground and revivify, and to chasten hypersensuality. Remember that you don‚Äôt know anything, and that this has always been the case, and has always been okay. 

Do not be scared of people.  You‚Äôve done nothing wrong. No one wants to hurt you. 

You have many friends you can trust. Krylon,Alicia, Alice, Zoe, Jeff G, Jessie, Adam, Stephanie, Clay are some names of people especially disinclined to pathologize neurodivergent expression, especially capable of seeing where you are, and holding space for the validity of your experience. Don‚Äôt bug them, but know they are there, and listen to them very closely if they reach you. 

You are a child of god, safe and protected. It is finally this faith that saves you, that keeps you within reach."

I‚Äôve never been less inclined to self-harm than I was that day, but the hospital fabricated after four or five hours of interrogating me about suicide and governmental paranoia a 5150 hold‚Äî I was diagnosed BP 1 and given Zyprexa.  A couple hours after taking the drug, and coming to my deranged senses in a hospital bed, the first inklings of terror irrupted into my experience, and I lost my shit, got strapped down, injected, etc.  I am convinced the anti-psychotic demented an organically occurring, probably healing ecstasy‚Äî I fucking wish every day I‚Äôd been disagreeable enough, in that elevated otherworldly condition, to assert my right to stay out of the medicalizing institutions.  A pacific and mystical awakening became violent psychosis once I‚Äôd been detained and drugged‚Äî since then, I‚Äôve been a shambolically recovering, suicidally dysphoric pariah, lurking gratefully here to fortify my righteousness with your stories and outrage.

bipolar,fece0dc,t3_eoc2bz,1578971669.0,"Intuitively it feels like mindfulness is way better at combatting worldly franticness (anxiety) than depression, which latter condition feels always already over mindful, sagging with mind.  That said, some homespun combo of holotropic breathwork (not legit with sitter and music etc, just kinda improvised forceful ventilation and tension gathering/releasing) and hyper-oxygenated empty-mindedness has afforded me some acute relief from that ilk of depression where ANY changes at all are desperately sought.   This is hardly a more dignified spectacle than auto-asphyxiation and biochemically is probably pretty close to that.  Careful tho: bipolar people are discouraged from or even disallowed in formal workshops holotropic breathwork.  ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

bipolar,fdxug13,t3_enc4g6,1578773038.0,"It‚Äôs a perennially humbling experience, realizing we can‚Äôt hold in some homeostatic hypomania that‚Äôs just right, that furnishes that sense of authenticity you speak of, without dilating inexorably into megalomaniacal delusion.  

It doesn‚Äôt always go that far, but when it does, it‚Äôs hard to deny how uncontrollable the process‚Äî when it yields of its own accord, and relapses into a bearable depressive spell mistakable for stability, it‚Äôs easier to fantasize sustainability.  

Maybe someday the scattershot and woefully imperfect arsenal of pharmaceuticals will resolve into a few highly effective and side-effectless tinctures, that maintain an ideal energy without spilling over into mania or bottoming out in depression. There‚Äôs something queerly dystopian to this panacea scenario, but it‚Äôs conceivably possible, given likely paradigmatic scientific breakthroughs. 

For now, medicated or no, the ideal is a transitorily glimpsed interstice, on the way to something higher or lower‚Äî I hope this moment holds for you, and that knowing that it will pass (as everything does) doesn‚Äôt mar overmuch the wonder and excellence of the experience, which is arguably just as authentic as any other. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
