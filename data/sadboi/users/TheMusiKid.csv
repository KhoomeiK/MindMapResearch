Even SpongeBob has secret messages meant specifically for me to hear and feel bad about myself and what I did. If I did commit suicide (I have no idea; I don't remember what happened during my trip at all) then my soul is incompatible with heaven and I am doomed to Hell. Fuck the devil, fuck god for creating me, and fuck reality.

I have no idea what's going on and it pisses me off. Maybe the LSD was poisoned? Maybe I just willed myself to die? I have no idea.

However I would say that my conviction that I'm in Hell (or a hellish dimension) is based on more than just feelings.

Firstly, there's the nightmares: almost every night I get bad dreams about Hell or things related to it.

Then, there's the references: very often I'll see references to Hell and damnation in media and conversations all around me. In songs I'll hear things like ""it's too late to apologize"" or ""we'll be burning up like neon lights"" that I can tell are directed toward anyone who is on their way to Hell.

Third, nothing is funny anymore: it seems like all my joy has been stolen from me. Nothing in TV, or movies, or reddit is funny to me. I am now aware that God is the source of all things good, and that since I wasn't a believer when I died from the LSD, I have to experience existence without Him.

Lastly, things have been going wrong at an accelerating rate recently, and everything is just below the point where I can't handle it. I fear that total chaos is on its way soon and there's nothing I can do about it.

I also feel bad for my loved ones which have to experience my leaving them without saying goodbye :/."
Psychosis,fdfebpx,t1_fdfckvm,1578359693.0,"Thanks so much for taking the time to walk me through this. It does help and it gives me hope that I haven't left anyone behind.

I would say that I am afraid that everyone is a copy of their real-world counterpart, but that this version of them doesn't have a soul, making you guys very susceptible to influence by demons.

I have been on antipsychotics (Invega Sustenna) for about a year now. The suspicion that I had died never truly went away, but the ""delusions"" of reference seemed to subside for a time. The nightmares are constant though: always creepy and/or scary. Also, few things are funny anymore.

Those are my anecdotal evidence for being in Hell.

My only logical attempts to refute it is as follows:
1) People can't really die from LSD
2) What if I had been decapitated? How could I have traveled to an alternate reality with no head?
3) There seems to be love and support in this reality, which probably wouldn't exist in Hell.

The whole experience is very reminiscent of the movie Coraline, mixed with Jacob's Ladder."
Psychosis,fdfa6p4,t1_fdf6dz5,1578356907.0,"Thanks so much for taking the time to provide such good feedback. I appreciate it greatly. It is hard not to over think, especially when it's my soul and eternal damnation at stake. I do need to find something to keep my mind busy, that's for sure.

I like the term ""give your actors business"". I think that thinking like this will help me, thank you.

Have a great day!"

Psychosis,fdf82mu,t1_fdf5yer,1578355477.0,"Thank you,

I just mean I fear it is too late because I might already have died and gone to Hell/Purgatory/Limbo.

What if Hell is just an alternate reality without God's presence/love, and that's where we are now? You might be a copy of your real-world counterpart without a soul.

That's what I'm afraid of.

I appreciate your time and reassurance, I'm just scared that I already died, and that's why it's too late for me :/"

I sincerely hope my mind is just playing tricks on me, but it doesn't feel like it."
Psychosis,fdf58d0,t1_fdf4ih0,1578353596.0,"Thank you for your input and well wishes.

I only did LSD the one time and have no inclination to try it again. I am too afraid to even try pot or any other psychotropic substances for fear of making things worse.

I just wish the dreams would stop and I could have a restful sleep.

I appreciate your time and I hope everything works out for you as well."

Psychosis,fdf4fg1,t1_fdf1ida,1578353067.0,"I remember something that was infinitely pleasurable when I was tripping, and I fear that I completely destroyed my brain.

I didn't have a trip sitter and I took too much. It might have been poisoned, or I might have bashed my head in, or something else.

I don't know how I could have died, but I'm seeing the signs that I'm in Hell everywhere."

schizophrenia,fdf0dot,t3_ekxt69,1578350474.0,"I am very sure that I died from LSD three years ago and my consciousness shifted to this parallel dimension (a.k.a. Hell), where there is no more Good. 

I see references to it everywhere (movies, TV, song titles, music) and I am sure that the demons are taunting me (heck, all of you might well be demons). I feel so bad for those I left behind and it hurts me so much that I can never say good bye to them and give them closure.

At the same time I am also terrified of the hellfire that I am sure will present itself in this reality (or if I die again).

Please, if you have any way to help me logic my way out of this damnation, I plead you for it. I am just so certain and it feels incredibly hopeless.

Thanks so much for your help."

I may not be in Hell, but I certainly cannot feel the presence of God anymore, and that is kind of a Hell in and of itself, especially if it is eternal...

Thanks again for the reply. It does help me."
schizophrenia,fcwr3m4,t1_fcwm9z4,1578034281.0,"Thank you for sharing. The only thing I've found is Cotard delusion, which is when someone thinks they are dead. I have not found any delusions specific to being in Hell, especially none with my symptoms. Nightmares about Hell and demons almost every night, seeing references in movies, music, and TV. And then there's the anhedonia: nothing is funny at all; everything is just overdone and rehashed.

People are so quick to anger and everything is going wrong. 

These reasons are why I know I died and am in Hell. Do you have any tips as to how you overcame this ""delusion""?"

Now I'm either dead, or the LSD catalyzed the illness of schizoaffective. I honestly can't tell either way.

There is nothing I can do, and that is what sucks the most.

Anyway sorry for ranting. I don't know how else to feel better. Thanks for listening, even if you might be demons just playing with my mind.

Anyway I can't wait for this decade to be over either."
