Learn to stay tight and with more experience you will know how to use the 5-6-3, 6-5-4.

Now to the black kid, man it took heart and effort. Kid must have had a sore stomach for sure. I Think he was reckless in that he had no cardio or didn't seem to have any real boxing training. I think that was dangerous to throw punches like that for someone so novice, although with training that heart was fantastic."

The will be a shortage of dollars due to the FED buying the bonds and decreasing the money supply. This will break the dollar because we have used it to as the global backstop and other countries will seek out other currencies or a basket of other currencies to use to trade. This will end if the Central Banks and governments take over all these pensions that are about to go bust. At that point you will receive deflation as the dollar pegs to the new standard but it has to deflate because of the first early spike in the dollar.
