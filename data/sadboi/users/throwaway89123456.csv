BPD,fozyrzx,t1_fozyiyh,1588199288.0,"Honestly, I reread my comment... It seems very simple solution but REALLY worked. On purpose, I started hanging out with more girls, and do more girly stuff that made me feel prettier too! (And that girly way of complementing each other!)"
BPD,fozyiyh,t3_gab8zk,1588199158.0,"I used to be like that! And then I just started to force myself to compliment on people, tell them they are beautiful. I felt like I am a step ahead of my insecurity. It worked! These days I do not get jealous of beautiful people."
BPD,fovg1qo,t1_fou3ytz,1588100703.0,Thank you. To know that people went through similar emotions and situations makes it more acceptable. Thank you for validating my emotions... How are you? Where in the process of recovery are you? Congratulations on going through that and surviving bad moments!

BPD,fohas4o,t1_fohamum,1587762860.0,How do I start studying DBT by myself? I meet my therapist weekly only and we are just starting.
BPD,foasexr,t1_foar096,1587651688.0,Love this response... ❤️ Thank you so much
BPD,fo8hvwu,t3_g61u5j,1587596869.0,But a question to all -- how do you make sure to stay away from an FP? It's not a choice to just start obsessing about someone!
BPD,fnt6ocv,t1_fnt6gvd,1587235650.0,Why he's not respecting my needs?
