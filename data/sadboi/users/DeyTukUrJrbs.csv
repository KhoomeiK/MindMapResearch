Unless you can definitely point to behaviour of yours that you know is wrong (e.g. without him telling you so), it sounds like he's trying to make you doubt everything you're doing. It's very common amongst immature and narcissistic people (I have a close friend who is married to one, and the partner is horrible, very self-centered and just wrecks everything my friend does for themselves).

Some questions for you (don't have to answer them here, just to think about):

1) what are you getting out of the relationship? Do you honestly feel that he's supporting you and on your side  (pointing out these supposed 'flaws' doesn't count)? 

2) what is your attraction to him?

3) what do your friends think of this relationship? Do you have anyone you can honestly talk to about this?

4) think about if you were ending the relationship tomorrow. You don't have to deal with this anymore. You are on your couch, just chilling out. 

How do you feel about this? 

Is there any element of relief?

I think the very fact you've posted this in the first place indicates that there's part of you that knows this behaviour isn't right. Trust your instincts. It sounds like he's shifting all blame into you and away from him. If you can get out of this, then I advise thinking about it right now.

Takes two to tango, and also two to find a resolution to an argument. It sounds like all the emphasis, pressure etc is on you in the relationship, and who wouldn't be having dread, panic attacks etc in a relationship like that?

If he's putting all of this on you, compounding the issue by this mental issues crap to try making you question/justify yourself constantly and isn't being approachable and self-aware enough to challenge him on this, then I'd recommend getting out that relationship ASAP.

books,fow4fle,t3_g9q9hq,1588112824.0,"I hope it's not ""too"" faithful. There's a difference between a good adaptation which uses the merits of each medium to it's fullest, and one that just slavishly tries to photocopy the original.

The Watchmen movie did the latter (Zack Snyder's MO for ""faithfulness"" in his adaptations is ""do exactly the same, shot for shot"") and was poorer for it. The best bit of the film, ironically, was the opening timelapse of the dawn of superheroes, which was an entirely original sequence not in the book.

Fight Club is another one that has narration taken from the book, but has its own style and flow (and a better ending IMO) because it uses all the tricks of modern cinema rather than slavishly recreating the book.

Thought I loved Sheen and Tennant in the Good Omens adaptation (hated the kids unfortunately, too over-enunciating and RADA-y for me), it was almost playing it too safe in some areas. There was a hell of a lot of narration which was literally describing *what you were seeing on the screen*. Show, don't tell wherever possible. The scene with Crowley and the plants is one example - it could have been done with a lot more imagination, (zooming shots flying around these luscious plants and showing they're actually micro-shaking all the time through abject fear), but just felt like a visual Jackanory in the way out was executed (or Reading Rainbow to American readers).

I know there's a hesitation in adaptations, especially when the author can't have their say. I recall Gaiman saying something like it was difficult to excise bits that likely belonged to Terry out of respect, but for me it's more important to capture the essence of the characters, the environment and the broad strokes of the story. 

You don't have to jettison the narration completely. The bbc radio play of Guards Guards has Martin Jarvis as the narrator and it's just right in setting you up, dropping the good book jokes in but not dominating it. As an aside, it also has the best voice for Death I've ever heard too (even the cast credits has, ""with Death, as Death"").

Probably the best example of an adaptation that does the broad strokes version with narration is the film of  Trainspotting. That was a prefect adaptation. Funny, smart, kept the characters it needed and beats of the story. Excised others, and it worked as a film. Something of that quality please. With less heroin and more wizards."

Then they kind of retconned the retcon in Rebirth, having the  Superman (and OG Lois & kid) from the OG pre-new 52 come in and replace 52 neck collar Superman.

And then tried to merge the two together (basically creating a third uniform) after.

Jeez DC. And New 52 was supposed to simply things!

The tv series in comparison has plotlines that make no sense. The show tries to follow the beats of the comics without having the plot logic to back it up. Why aren't they on V anyway? I can only think it's a budget reason as they couldn't afford the extra effects (though the money appears to be there for everything else). 

Even Butcher in the comics says that there's no point going up against Supes without being on the V as there no point taking them on when they can just punch your head off in the first fight you have.
It makes no sense why Mothers Milk is called what he is, if compound V is not already a thing. And why do they seem to be so new to everything when this is a regrouping of the group?

There's always criticism of Ennis in his writing style, but I tend to think it's people who aren't used to the British 2000AD punk writing style that started out in 2000AD (where Ennis started) and expecting something more Marvel/DCesque. Nasty shit that took the piss off the status quo was par for the course. The Boys is more in the style of Marshall Law, which is very similar in its treatment of superheroes.

Veidt is on a quest to save humanity from itself. He's got demonstrably the skills for it, and he equates himself to the leaders of history. As he goes about his plan, he commits 100% to sacrificing his own humanity and needs to the cause. He murders, on a small and eventually grand scale. He manipulates, he treats people as pawns in his greater game for the greater good (very utilitarian).

Why on earth would he jeopardise all of his achievements for a relationship with another person? To introduce a person into his world who doesn't serve any purpose other than to ask questions and cause complications (and when would he have time for this?!)? 

It's just another sacrifice of his humanity he's given up to ensure that his plan works. He doesn't have to be asexual to justify this and I would argue to make him to ""make sense"" if why there's not a partner diminishes his commitment to the plan and smacks of unimaginative writing. It's the same level as a monk going to serve a higher cause, and giving up his worldly desires. 

Possibly pre-Minutemen (Veidt's revelation from the Comedian) would be involved with someone when he was just a vigilante, but he's the ""world's smartest man"" - even if he's in a tier of people, then that's going to be a small dating pool in NYC at the time!"

I'd say that particular stage in Watchmen (where we see Nixon being briefed on the Nuclear war and what they'll lose in the US) would be more equivalent to the Cuban Missile Crisis where nuclear war seemed to be extremely imminent. 

1989 has made me think about the cyclical nature of humanity though. In 1989 it was fall of the Berlin Wall, collapse of communism as the US saw it (ignoring the sleeping giant of China, and we see how that has turned out), Francis Fukuyama theorising that we had reached the ""end of history"" and we'd be going to a new level of humanity with social capitalism coming in and elevating us all.

I really think humanity with our short lifespans are doomed to repeat our mistakes if we don't start taking more notice of history and stop thinking that we're doing new things. Particularly now, where everything is geared towards simple, quick answers and no nuance or shades of gray - the only learners of history seem to be dictatorial rylers like the Chinese, trying to social engineer any oppressive action out, 1984-style.

It was one of the key things identified from the counselling, and it was so helpful having a third - party there to give advice or spot the essential dynamics that may need to be changed to progress. You could basically see it more as a relationship check-up before going into anything like marriage. It doesn't have to wait until the last stages of a relationship. 

These days we have the arguments, and they may be blazing arguments BUT they get shit done as we're being honest with each other, and we do a post-match review after we've got our cooler heads on to make sure that whatever is agreed definitely addressees whatever the issue was.

I went for Xbox as the specs were much better (any PS2 cross-play form game was always better quality on the Xbox). Plus as well Sony was putting out huge amounts of bullshit about the PS2's capability of their ""emotion engine"". Getting George Lucas to say it was going to be doing Star Wars level real-time rendering! Jaysis.

Watchmen,facgw75,t1_fa9k4gl,1575939276.0,"Agree completely with your argument about DM's characterisation. He was way too human a character for the god-like being he was (including his perceptions). 

It seemed a very anthropomorphic and unimaginative (ironically) writing of a post-human character that was now on a different plane of values and perspective. It was a illogical step back for the way his character was going to have romantic emotion enter as a motivation at all - done to service the story, not the character. 

If it was really following the comic character's arc, he wouldn't appear at all in the show (and would be off creating life nowhere near the milky way, let alone so ""near"" us at Europa). Our petty (in galactic terms) political squabbles just don't register as a reason to be back."

So again - this is not the sentiment of someone who's going to stick around. He's got a gods-view of human interaction now.

Watchmen,fa7lzb7,t3_e7xsn2,1575835968.0,"Well argued. 

It works as well because there's evidence. The squid is right there and it's too big to be hidden. It can be dissected, taken apart etc and it can't be passed off as anything else. Energy blasts would always have ""it \*could\* be Russians/Americans/global terrorists"" (etc) factor, or even genuinely from Dr. Manhattan, but directed by Americans as  degeneratepepe rightly points out. 

That's why I was a bit dissatisfied that they had the squid dissolve away in the TV series - that's dumb. The point is it's so fucking BIG and there that it couldn't be hidden and turned into a conspiracy theory - Veidt wouldn't have gone all this way to do something so massive that it eliminates all doubt by humanity. And the fact it was actually living (only dying on teleportation) means you're not going to have an Area 51 style rubber-alien doubt about it as it's taken apart."
TheBoys,fa6lvsk,t1_fa69w02,1575826031.0,"I think you're being very reductionist in your viewing of Hughie - I really liked his characterisation. 

Regarding the violence, he was someone who had lost his love through an incredibly scarring trauma, so he's going to have triggers, especially when it comes to supes (which is probably one of the reasons Butcher targeted him in the first place - he wants people who've been hurt and want to hurt back). But ultimately he wasn't a type of person that violence was a go-to reaction unlike the rest of the Boys.  \[Spoiler for non-comics readers, though the show isn't really following the book anyway\] >!His fights were pretty much panic-induced rather than through anger. The killing of Blarney Cock was more out of panic than anything else as he didn't know his own new strength fresh on compound V, his punch of Swingwing was to stop SW getting away and was goaded on by Butcher who was trying to ""toughen him up"" and he headed into a fight with Godolkin and co understandably after what had been uncovered. You can hardly blame him for his actions against A-Train, considering this was the murderer of Robin and the catalyst for him joining the Boys in the first place. I didn't feel his reactions were inappropriate (even then, it took pushing from Butcher with the recordings of Annie to get him to that point). !<

I wouldn't say he was whining - it was more pushing back and wanting to be part of the Boys and being taken seriously, when he felt that he was being used as comic relief for a lot of the time (his Bagpipe alias, Butcher always having the last word etc) so the frustration got to him. I didn't ever get the feeling he was judging the Boys on what they did - he just didn't like the world they exposed to him. Though he was a conspiracy follower, at the same time Hughie's a romantic/idealist, and reacted how any normal person would when you want to believe the world is a good and just place, but see unarguable evidence that this isn't the case. 

But he took to the work well and got the respect of the team through his behaviour - he took to the recon work on Teenage Kix, his work on the Swingwing case got him some plaudits (with Butcher admitting that he saw things that Butcher would have missed) and his arc with Annie is fantastic, and very well written for anyone who's been pissed off with a loved one's actions and said words in anger you can't take back. 

Comic Hughie was a decent bloke in very weird circumstances."

Watchmen,f834vys,t3_dy73j9,1574204415.0,"This is what I don't get. Veidt pulled off the whole squid conspiracy himself. And then hid it pretty much perfectly, taking the morally disgusting actions needed to make sure all roads lead to the dead.

A) why would he need the government?
B) why on earth would he think that the squid rain etc, if carried out by government contractors/workers etc would remain a credible secret?

It just takes one whistleblower to start investigations going - unless the people in the Appropriations Committee are literally doing these drops themselves you've got a whole machine here where you're not going to be able to kill off everyone (moral issues aside) who is involved. 

It's not gonna take long to piece together even if the drop is kept anonymous (""hey, I did a flyover in this place and squid rain happened right after!"").

Only way the tape makes sense is if Veidt incorporates the discovery into his next phase of human development. But the variations of what could happen after that are just too large to be incorporated into any plan, and why would Veidt risk restarting predictable international tensions (""American fraud on the world!"" ) when he's gone so far to redirect them?

It feels like a stupid and narcissistic move by the smartest man on the planet. It's not the comic Veidt - he was far too self-aware, which is why he was so careful and the conspiracy worked. I don't feel this version of Veidt (tape or present time) would be able to do that plan.

There is humanity in him to make an allowance like this (and feel the weight of the burden he's taken on, which is leaking into his dreams at that point).

The tape is just a step too far, and straight-up dumb however. Pretty much a straight, undeniable confession from the man behind it all, that could be easily distributed to take down the biggest successful private conspiracy in the world (all done without govt. assistance)?

Watchmen,f6xtjoa,t3_dtha1w,1573258123.0,"COMICS SPOILERS WARNING before I go on, just in case there's new readers here:

I'm liking it a lot more than I expected to. I get quite wary of adaptations of my fav comic runs because there's been so much bastardisation and shallowness of recent takes (Preacher and The Boys were both massive disappointments to me, just taking the shallowest takes on the respective stories). 

It was probably also due to apprehension because of the Watchmen movie which disappointed me - I was really fearing it was a continuation of the Snyder style-over-substance era. However, this Watchmen seems to  be on another level. I'm finding this take has got enough smarts behind it that it's genuinely interesting on the story and what's going on, and it feels a lot more mature than other comic takes. I was also impressed that they're following the comics timeline and events and not spoonfeeding everything to the audience, rather than relying on the movie - even though it might make more sense from a televisual storytelling POV, since direct continuation crossovers from comics to large-budget TV are pretty much nonexistent. 

There's still questions I have with regards to the world (which I'm hoping will be answered as we go on) - 

\- I know it's been a few decades now, but I want to know more about the world situation. The comic run went from a local murder mystery to global war politics. There was a fucking massive alien squid dropped on New York. Aliens were considered to be true for a time! Psychic shockwaves reverberated around the world. People probably still having flashback nightmares about it even now, probably needing therapy/medication for the rest of their life to get through it  (I'd certainly recall dreams about having a baby eating it's way out of me). But there seems at present very little, if at all acknowledgement or reference of what happened apart from the aside from Laurie in episode 3. and the strange squid rain. No cults of ""the squid was true"" around (in the same way as we saw those groups in ""Contact""). Have one person with the jitters, or a drugs problem that repeats due to them having ""those dreams"" again. Something to come in on that a bit more would be good. 

I am assuming this will probably be covered, but what happened with world peace, that seemed to be on the verge when we left the end of the comic story? Why was it all reversed when someone printed something from the crank file, and why did Rorschach's diary (presumably) make so much difference? I could see them being very easily debunked and neutered in the same way as the Hitler diaries. If Veidt is still around. he'd be in a great position to do this if needed, having infinitely more cachet with the public than the insane, violent, perverted (as far as some interviews labelled him) killer. The worldbuilding is really interesting, and I love all that type of stuff, but it would be great to have a grander view of how things have changed outside of American politics, as the scale of Veidt's plans were fixing a global problem with one quick strike. 

If Ozy is somewhere else other than Earth, which the ""spacesuit"" experiment seems to suggest, I hope Jon wasn't involved in moving him somewhere, as Jon had effectively left Earth to it's own devices and wanting to go off and make life of his own (embracing his own ""godhood""). His emotional ties to the Earth had pretty much gone to zero (possibly only Laurie, but he was pleased that she moved onto Dan when he found them together before he left in Karnak). 

And speaking of which - what happened with that? Is there anything on Mars which now suggests there's life on there which we know about? All reports seem to suggest that Jon's still on his own on Mars, so what happened there? 

I liked Laurie's introduction in ep 3 - really interesting take on what happened with her, as we left her in the comics embracing a more Comedian-like adaptation of her Silk Spectre guise (adding leather, possibly a gun) which seemed to suggest that she's getting some peace with her background. However, it did surprise me that she went to Blake (her father's surname) rather than the other two options, if she's no longer having to have her identity change (I presume if Dan's not around anymore, then their assumed identities they had as Mr & Mrs Hollis died with him). 

Iron's portrayal of Veidt (which also ties into the writing) is something I'm still on the fence on. It doesn't feel like a logical growth of the same character I read, as it seems quite broad in comparison with the more nuanced portrayal in the comics (like the magazine interview in the appendix). I can't believe that whatever happened to him brought the smartest person in the world to his intellectual knees. So I'm very curious as to where this particular plotline is going. 

But overall, I like being this curious about it that I want to watch what's going to happen further in this take, as opposed to feeling too much that I'm watching a series that only has a cursory glance at the source materials. I'm okay with the speed of the show, but I do hope we get some more motion on the cops storyline, as that's moving a tad too slowly at present - all moves are being done by the 7th Cavalry, the police (apart from the Nixonville raid) seem to be very passive in comparison.  So I'm in for the foreseeable future, unless there's a particular clanger that drops (or there's loads of hatches that suddenly start appearing in the Lindof tradition)."

Me and my very long-term partner went through couples counselling years ago more (through Relate, a well-known counselling service in the UK) when we were experiencing real issues and going to potentially break up - this was one of the main findings.

Essentially we were having arguments which never actually were honest, and so there was a lot of passive aggressiveness or resentment. I felt it a lot from the cultural conditioning us men get about holding back but honestly thought I was beyond it (I'm very much in the ""sensitive man"" stereotype and have no problem being romantic, crying in films etc that the other male members of my family were very much not like). 

However, during the course of the counselling, we found we were both ""rounding off the corners"" of our points in arguments, which meant they never actually got to the heart of what we wanted to say. We were being ""too nice"" even in moments when we're swearing and shouting at each other!

So lesson was, have arguements that really say what pisses you off. It might not be rational. It might not be easy to explain. But *say it*. Coach it in ""I'm not sure why, but it honestly really fucks me off when you do this...."" if you need to but don't not say it. I had a load of bottled up anger in arguements where I wanted to break shit, punch walls etc, and it was because I never felt I got anywhere in arguements. I always"" lost"", but it was due to my own inability to argue my corner honestly, as much as anything.

However, it has enough time to breathe and take its time and it was better for it. 

Writing and acting are great - there is a bit of a shift where it goes from dark comedy with drama elements to drama with comedy elements halfway through. But personally that worked for me and made it more interesting. 

I must admit, having the repeat of multiple viewpoints technique in there repeatedly was one I thought might wear, but it actually gave a great view into how intricately it was plotted with minor asides that become very plot relevant after when you see the other side of what was happening.
