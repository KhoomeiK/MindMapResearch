The main character I'm playing as right now is basically The unofficial ""protector"" of The Pale/Dawnstar. most of the quests I do our waking nightmare, side quest for the Jarl stuff like that.

Another fun character I mess with now and again is a Breton conjuration/destruction mage, after becoming the archmage of the College of Winterhold.

For me, the game is mostly about immersing myself in a fantasy type story of my own creation. The main quest is cool at all, I just never got very invested in it."
