AskEconomics,f1edd76,t3_d8y1y1,1569419574.0,"I graduated with an econ degree not too long ago and found a job in real estate banking virtually right after i received my diploma. Most of what I do is probably more applicable to finance/accounting majors, however, my background in economics helps me to understand the ""big picture"" more clearly than I think i would if i had studied finance. 

Through experience I've learned most of the finance/accounting concepts ill ever need for my daily job requirements, so my lack of expertise/degree in those fields isn't really a hindrance any more.

I had a classmate who went on to become an actuary, another in law school and some who are in consulting. 

Hopefully this helps, feel free to pm me if you have any questions."
