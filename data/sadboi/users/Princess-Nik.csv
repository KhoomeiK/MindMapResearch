I‚Äôm currently playing around trying to do little bits in the softwares for creating clothing mesh (hoping to get better at using them and therefor will most likely update the early runs). I decided to play around with sleeves and capes as I‚Äôm hoping to recreate some of my favourite looks from each queen of Season 12. 

I decided starting with Aiden Zhane would be the best for me (for obvious reasons. No this is not a read - Aiden has a less is more approach to drag and that‚Äôs perfectly valid). 

This is my attempt to doing a cape (which I can of course later go on to alter to match Aiden‚Äôs cape). 

(Of course this isn‚Äôt perfect nor is it a complete item.)

I‚Äôm pretty pleased with this tbh. It has been extremely challenging but really fun so far."

But yeah the way they judged that... someone placed in the bottom 2 purely because they - allegedly - had the plainest bottom (no double entendre intended) but the person who actually has the plainest bottom wins...

Though the real reason they put her in the bottom 2 (also allegedly) was because she had boring confessionals."
rupaulsdragrace,fqnkle9,t3_gjsiij,1589496536.0,"Laila‚Äôs performance in the Main Challenge was also underrated. I loved her look. I know the critique was that the top was cool but the bottom was boring. 

She was wearing a jacket/blazer she made from scratch, a Leotard (with only the panties showing), ripped fishnets (bc apocalypse so unlikely to not be ripped not bc she was being messy) and thigh high boots.

Meanwhile Kim Chi (whose look I loved) wore a leotard with some wigs glued on but the panties part bare. Skin coloured tights. A standard black pump and won the challenge. 

But Laila‚Äôs lower half - with more going on - was boring.

Yes honestly addiction is so prevalent in the lgbt+++ community. Whether that‚Äôs because of bullying that‚Äôs often experienced, feeling like an outcast or whatever else I don‚Äôt know. But I do know it‚Äôs prevalent in our community. (I‚Äôm a pansexual woman who, due to a medical condition that means I have high testosterone levels, thought I was trans for quite some time as I was uncomfortable with my body and didn‚Äôt feel it was womanly enough to be a woman. I thought I had to transform my body to be that of a Male - I‚Äôve since worked through this and realised I‚Äôm not trans and am still learning to be comfortable with and accept my body.)

When AS5 are touring in the UK/dragcon comes around, I am determined to meet her and let her know what a powerful influence she has been on my life. She walked into the work room and I was like wow what a cute and beautiful queen she is but I never thought she would be someone who made me feel so validated and understood.

ptsd,fo7swog,t1_fo7gdwi,1587583985.0,My therapy is covered by the NHS. We‚Äôve just reached the end of treatment and I‚Äôm just concerned about myself after as I had previously tackled this issue in therapy as I was in the spot immediately following my trauma and I was fine and went back to work then 9 months later I was back in the same place.
