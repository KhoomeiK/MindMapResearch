offmychest,f1nd4iy,t3_da4d9h,1569614477.0,"I went through this several years ago. The position wasn't even offered to me, but I sent HR my resume anyways. I am an uneducated woman working at a financial institution that predominantly puts males in my position. I was applying against a college-educated white male with more experience at that particular position but less years with the company. I went into the interview and basically told them that I know my customers at my branch better than anyone at the company and had been working as my previous bosses right-hand for over 8 years. When they asked what I would do if I were not given the position, I told them my ultimate goal was to move up with a company that valued me and would afford me that opportunity - if it wasn't with them, so be it. They ultimately gave me the position and while I'm not as energetic about finances as I once was (over a decade of banking will burn you out), I'm so glad I took the stand and went after the position. 

I remember the morning of my interview I ran around my block at like 5AM for an hour. If I get super nervous my voice gets shaky and my mouth gets super dry. Running before an interview or speech helps calm my nerves. Just remember, you deserve the position more than anyone else (I'm sure no one else is on the verge of throwing up they want the position so bad). Just try to stay out of your head and go over every interview question imaginable online. You got this!

They have two children together, both practically teenagers. I have no children, and being 30, realize I really don't have all the time in the world I thought I had in my 20's. While we both work decent jobs, I do not believe we would have the money to afford reversal or IVF. This is something I struggle with. He claims he would be open to doing whatever was necessary in the future, but I could only image the financial burden would be overwhelming, not to mention the significant chance of the procedure failing and putting yourself through the emotional and financial pain. 

It makes it worse that I've never even wanted children until seeing the way he is with his children - he's the kind of man that was made to be a dad. So, it's disheartening to say the least. Adoption is always an option, but waiting lists are long, and the financial costs associated with adoption are ridiculous. 

I don't feel like I would end my relationship with him at this point, because I love him more than the thought of having children, but I can certainly empathize with you on this. I will say, it's positive that he feels the same way as you and has stated he would get a reversal/IVF. It sounds like he's willing to do his part, whatever that may be.

Take the day to yourself and focus on your own healing. I wish your relationship all the healing in the world, but if you find you can't continue on as too much damage has been done, that okay too.

DeadBedrooms,eve0qo0,t1_evdv4v8,1564452402.0,Second this.
LongDistance,evd45ue,t3_cj4ko1,1564429717.0,Also wondering why he has a ring on his left hand?
AsOneAfterInfidelity,ev17jjp,t1_ev14ebn,1564153608.0,"I‚Äôm sorry, but you want the child to have no relationship with their biological father because of your feelings? That‚Äôs selfish af. Why are you punishing the child for your husbands mistake? 

Leave him if you can‚Äôt continue to have a relationship with him, but giving him an ultimatum of not seeing his own child is cruel and selfish. 

I can assure you I would never be with a man that would choose anything or anyone, myself included, over being involved in their child‚Äôs life. But, maybe that‚Äôs just the fact that I grew up without a very active father."
TwoXSex,ev16bri,t3_ci2rl5,1564153020.0,Put a tampon in if you‚Äôre worried about making a mess - have him focus his attention on your clit. Nothing gross about it. I‚Äôm fine with my boyfriends face being between my legs any day of the month.
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,ev15ktn,t3_ci2ioo,1564152658.0,"My nex would often say he was sorry for the way that he would verbally assault me. In his ‚Äúapology‚Äù he would claim that he would only say those vitriol words because he ‚Äúloved‚Äù me so much. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because there‚Äôs so much passion and love‚Äù. 
I was an idiot and thought it made perfect sense. Little did I know he was sleeping with multiple women and coming home like nothing at all happened. Leaving was the best decision I‚Äôve ever made."
emotionalabuse,euqge07,t3_ch70z5,1563977924.0,"I think you need to ask yourself:
-	Do I really want to be with a man who would throw a huge temper tantrum about my own mother and her elderly dog staying with us during the hottest time of the year? 
-	Do I really want to be with a man that ridicules me for the food I eat and calls me fat?
-	Do I really want to be with someone who controls who I speak to? 

These are HUGE red flags. He‚Äôs toxic and has zero empathy and respect for you, your emotions and your family."
sexover30,euog0v0,t1_eunkyia,1563941244.0,Awe! I love y‚Äôall! I can only inspire to have such a strong relationship. So glad your wife is steadily improving!
love,euo9m4v,t3_ch1tuh,1563938970.0,"Ehh..I kinda got a creepy vibe. But whatever floats your boat. 

Come on downvotes."
deadbedroom,eulxdyd,t3_cgsc8x,1563908729.0,"If your wife were to come home and want to fuck your brains out, would you be down? Or, would you be less than interested? 
If your answer is the latter, it‚Äôs not a lack of physical intimacy and you need to be working on your exit plan. Worry about finding intimacy after you get out of the situation - but just focus on you until you are in a position to think about dating again. 
Please do not have an affair. It‚Äôs really not worth it to you or your spouse."

love,euioirk,t3_cgcc6a,1563852026.0,"I want a man to pay on the first date. I get that it‚Äôs a common practice nowadays for women to ‚Äúsplit the bill‚Äù, but if you can‚Äôt pay for inviting me on the date, assuming I was invited, don‚Äôt ask me out. If I ask a man to dinner, that‚Äôs a completely different scenario where I would want to pay for the bill."
survivinginfidelity,eugwbn3,t1_eughw7n,1563816094.0,This. The guilt normally subsides and greed takes it‚Äôs place.
AskRedditAfterDark,eugpzpz,t1_eufmnax,1563812711.0,What kind of surgery did you get?
emotionalabuse,eufgh6l,t3_cg4wk6,1563773448.0,Don‚Äôt go back. He‚Äôs toxic and you need someone who genuinely adores you. He‚Äôs not the dude.
AskRedditAfterDark,euf7kx0,t1_euej1wd,1563764895.0,"This happens to more women than people realize. I think it comes down to men not understanding that all vaginas look different and they‚Äôre all beautiful. We need to be teaching little men that vaginas are great and as long as the woman is healthy, she‚Äôs perfect."
ADHD,eu8skcd,t3_cczrms,1563563764.0,"Been doing this for about a year after my boss basically said I needed to start getting to work on time. Now, I take my Vyvanse at 4:45AM and wake up at 6AM, normally with no issues. Helped allow me to focus on getting ready and getting out the door in the mornings. I crash a little earlier at work, but it‚Äôs totally worth it."
depression,eu3npt5,t1_etqxumi,1563419742.0,"I deal with customers all day too. Some days I want to just run and hide - it‚Äôs SO hard to pretend to be an outgoing bubbly professional. My mind is thinking ‚Äú get tf away from me so I mentally don‚Äôt have to do this right now‚Äù, but I smile and push through. It‚Äôs so difficult."
depression,eu3l1gv,t1_etqqcj8,1563417565.0,"I stress out about wasting my life all the time. It‚Äôs actually my biggest anxiety. But, I can‚Äôt stop."
