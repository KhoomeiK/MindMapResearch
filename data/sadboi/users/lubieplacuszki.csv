I guess to live is to keep the facade. Some people don't see their masks, some people just never bother to take them off and some people struggle on and off with them."

depression,fdvm9rj,t1_fdtq5gl,1578748957.0,"So I always think this way about every doctor and never get any help. I postponed the psychiatrist, psychologist and now the endocrinologist. Heard about this being a difficult road as well. I have a lot of friends with thyroid problems, I know it's fairly common, my mother found me a good doctor, I'll see. I guess I have a mild case, though it must get worse and worse. I feel it got worse. Thank you for your help, I will remember your offer if I have any questions! Good luck to you too!"

depression,fa293do,t3_e7ml5m,1575779282.0,"Last year I met a great friend and for one month our friendship was like a crazy, drugged rollercoaster. Too intense but also so positive. I would never stop this, since I had felt so good for the very first time in a while. But he silenced me and disappeared from my life entirely, leaving me numb (for a year now).

So I've been thinking, is it really so wrong to experience such intensity? Is it the cause so many relationship crumbles? It literally doesn't make sense, when you think that people are searching for such a bliss and happiness. Experiencing euphoria is always desirable and we all want to be happy all the time. 

So what can we do, really? Should we pursue happiness or die from endless thirst? It has been a year now and I'm stuck with this thinking, afraid to really commit to my old or new relationships, shutting myself in. 

It really sucks man. Hang in there buddy. Maybe someday we will know what to do."

depression,f5qoz0n,t3_doph3h,1572380604.0,"Ahhh thank you for sharing this! I think I had something similar, I really fell for a guy, but I wouldn't call this love. I just really liked spending time with him, even though we mostly texted, played video games or talked via discord. We met on the train, it was a total coincidence, we talked all the way till our stop, he travelled somewhere else the next day, I helped him got to the bus - he was foreign, I was a girl from the country he was passing through. The whole relationship was so intense, it felt like we were soulmates or long lost siblings. And I was in the worst state of my depression so I didn't really care about anything and I was super honest. And maybe just like you, I was too emotional or to forward? After two months he silenced me. I tried reaching him but he never replied.

Last week was the first anniversary of our meeting. I have been feeling really hollow ever since he stopped talking to me. I moved on but not quite. Began drinking more, been more vary and conscious of new relationships. I can't completely get rid of him and it gives me a lot of pain. I somehow lost the ability to speak honestly with my friends, with my family, with anybody. 

Sorry for your loss. I'm preparing myself for something similar, my grandmother has lost her leg one year ago and it seems she's gonna loose another one. She feels worse day by day. And I'm there beside her, because she lives at my home, helping her and feeling so terribly empty, battling with my own demons. 

Thank you for sharing this. Best wishes to you."

depression,f3uuqjm,t3_di6on7,1571167708.0,"I always thought that people with mental illnesses are super tough. You not only have to cope with outer world but you have to deal with/stand your inner world every second of your life. Somehow everyone develops a certain defense mechanism. And you live in two different worlds. If that's not tough... This thinking helps me pass hard moments. Because fuck, we are strong as hell."
depression,ewr9zad,t3_cpg4vs,1565699707.0,"I think it's really hard to find people genuinely interested in helping you. I don't want to put a fault on those people unable to help and thus getting frustrated but they just can't communicate with us and its as frustrating for them as for us. My best friend for example, we have this unique friendship but my anxiety and depression often spoils it. And she somehow learnt to give up giving advices, not only for me but for others. Which is kind of sad, because I know that if it doesnt help me it can help others. It's easy saying that they just want to satisfy their sense of responsibility or just their desire of being helpful. It's just being a human being. Most things we do, we actually do for ourselves. If you are upset ask them why they need this assurance of helping you, it may enlighten them a little bit. Nobody likes to think that they are doing it for themselves only, but if they are willing to reflect on it... Maybe they will actually try to communicate more? Helping is not that easy."
depression,ewmu34o,t3_coocmq,1565560547.0,"thank you for the post, I've been thinking about this combination a lot. throw some other things like perfectionism and you find yourself in an endless spiral of self denial. god I can't remember how it feels to do things as an actual human being. are we a different specie? is what I often think."
depression,ew8jnxv,t3_cn9b6p,1565210619.0,"people are crazy, demanding and selfish. or just batshit crazy. I work in a library and I know I have to wear a mask just to get by. Sometimes there come real psychos and all you have to do is to be the nicest and understanding human being ever.
but I like working with people because you get to know how hard it actually is on the other side. you are more aware of the surrounding, you seldom get angry at other people in service or even if you get angry you calm yourself way quicker. it's a very positive thing. All I can say, keep your head straight but never get yourself pushed around. people will always have problems. A good manager should know if there really was a problem. Hope he/she is a good one."
depression,ew8g92n,t3_cn3zg6,1565209128.0,"isolating is the most effective way of shutting discussions about your bad state. is it healthy? well, as you wrote, you don't infect other people with negativity but I guess someday you gonna explode. I've been isolating people for more than a year and sometimes on very bad days it helps because nobody cares to contact you and you have just yourself. but sometimes it gets tougher when you get this unbearable loneliness and you can't communicate without unburdening yourself.
my best advice is alcohol with friends who 1) like to drink or 2) like to waste time at night. I've been hanging out every weekend for the past 3 months with some insomniac people. We drink, we talk but we never wake up our demons. I feel less isolated after every meeting even though I know life is still shit."
depression,erhlenr,t3_c1vdrf,1560877639.0,I think the best way (at least for me an introvert with dysthymia) to feel less sad about it is doing things for people and with people expecting nothing in return. Then you can surprise yourself by receiving something you didn't count in the outcome. It's like you just want people to be happy and that's the most important thing. It's hard to think that way but whenever I feel down I try to tell this to myself. Right now I'm super down feeling super lonely so I came here searching for a bit of understanding but I still try to get this thing in my head that whatever I do I just do it for the sake of it. I hope it gets better bro.
