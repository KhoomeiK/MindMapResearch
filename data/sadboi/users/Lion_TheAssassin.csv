OpenChristian,fql2cf4,t3_gjc5cz,1589443835.0,"Canaan, boy that is a tough one. There is a Catholic Bible translation that is sometimes maligned over it's notes and explanations as not being in accord with Catholic official doctrines. But it plainly states that many of the facts in the Exodus story and Joshua are probably exaggerated versions of some actual historical event. And it plainly points out that the Books of Moses number of israelis during the Exodus may have been overly inflated to create a founding myth for the post exilic Jews. It also states pretty clearly that the books up to judges were probably written in the post exilic period by rabbinical Jews trying to establish the identity of the Jewish state. (and now you can get an idea why this versions notes are controversial) it's the Biblia Latinoamericana (Latin American Bible). Anyway, in my conversations with Jewish believers, and My own readings of the Bible. I've come to realize that the view of God as an omnibenevolent entity may not have a full biblical basis. As we all know Jews don't see Jesus as a Messiah much less son of God and as such New Testament writings are not accorded the status of Holy Scriptures in Judaism. Anyway, there is a contradiction in Ideas about God in the Bible. The OT in it's belief that God is just ONE God. And that there are no other entity or power anywhere near it. Proclaims in Isaiah God stating to the prophet that he is the only, and one true God. And that he is the bringer of both good and evil. Jews, given their History see God as, if not evil, a God capable of kicking your ass if you are not meetings his expectations. And that for God to be truly Just, a proper judge he can bring harm upon the sinner. True justice demands that the wrong doer be stopped and chastised. This of course doesn't account for what in our views is seen as an overly cruel concept that of God punishing offspring for the sins of the father's. And for that I have absolutely no rationale. 


Anyway, back to the Canaanites. What was their Sin? What horrible abomination did they commit that they lost right to the lands and God commanded the Israeli troops to kill them all. Sometimes the Bible is not clear, or overly fixates on the theme of infidelity. Now sadly, while I can recall concepts that I may have found in my readings of the Bible. I am not conversant on Bible literature and cannot recite the Verses I may be refering to.  So I invite you all to take my words with a grain of salt and do some research. Anyway I was saying that the Bible gets overly fixated on whoredom and infidelity as a general theme. And when God becomes furious with Israel and no longer protects them he bitterly remarks that the Jews followed after the Abominations of the Canaanites, And whored themselves out to the Ba'als. So it's pretty easy to miss a particular remark in the Bible. I'm not sure which book it is from. But God is telling a prophet he intends to punish Israel. Because they did unthinkable Abominations and like the Canaanites of old they burned their children on fires to the Ba'als which is not something he commanded. And that it was so unthinkable that it never came to his head to demand the sacrifice of children to him or Ba'als. And for that abomination he must chastise his people so they remember their vows and the God that freed them from Israel. 
Of course this verse which is not often discussed in Christian circles is in glaring opposition to the central teaching of Christianity. A human sacrifice of the Son of God for the redemption of humanity."

One that is history and barebone fundamentals. One that is full comp. Science and teaches to code python while working on projects. The last few chapters go from syntax to algorithms and data manipulation and analysis. So im guessing it's an intro to data science. A 35 week web development course that teaches html, css, JavaScript, and the different frameworks. And of course a hyper intensive 23 chapters of data science path. There are quick skills courses. And other freemium courses that are either survey or intro courses. And syntax intro for other languages. Honestly it seems pretty thourough 

My current idea is to work through the computer science course and learn python from it  And follow with the python skills. Maybe in between finish the git and command line courses as they taught a bit of git and command line those courses are marked as started . Before starting the web dev path.

Catholicism,fms98o3,t3_fx5399,1586350191.0,"My first advice would be to seek help independently of the Church dogma. While Catholicism gives you a clear outline of what to do in life. Whether it does so by coercing certain actions through reward or punishment,  (heaven and hell). Or by giving you certain mechanism of coping with your life struggles by defining routines, allowing you time for meditation, or a mechanism of expiation. It is honestly not for everyone, and it is woefully unprepared to help people for whom staying alive is a chore, and that are on the border of life and death. I know this for a fact, Catholicism changed my dad's life for the better. While he was always a great person. He used to be rough, uncouth, and ruly. When he became Catholic he changed so much for the better and was honestly a really damn good Catholic. He was loved by the whole Latino community of my town. Happy. Warm. Caring. A giving person that sought to bring joy to people. Except, he was horribly mentally ill. And that was eating at his inner core. From 2008 to 2015 he fought so hard to stay alive. We fought alongside him. Pulled him out of the horrible hole his hallucination episodes pulled him into. but, and here is where I mean that the Church is woefully unprepared. He would feel better and feel that God had healed him. Yet he would collapse after two years. Which in the end convinced him that God did not want to help him. That God had abandoned him. Because In the gospel Jesus said knock and it shall be given. What you ask from God in faith he will provide. Yet healing never came until he gave up on life and pulled a gun on himself 5 years ago. The Church which had helped him grow and become a better person ended up robbing him of his will to fight. The night before he wandered off and we found him after two hours in front of Christ Eucharist. With tears running down his eyes and going through a hallucination like episode."

You would be an hypocrite if you started condemning as bad and telling others not to do it. The message is good, but your actions don't reflect you fully accepting it as your own. Again show me your works not your words."
excatholic,fms7jrp,t1_fms62ak,1586348902.0,"You can advocate againsts sinful acts, you can role model holy living. You can do a thousand things. But you can't condemn sin, while being sinful. Only one man was pure enough to judge us, and he told the sinners that were trying to stone the adulteress that he who is free from sin to cast the first stone while writing in the ground probably their names and their sins. And when he got up there was no one left and he asked the adulteress woman where are those that condemn you. To which she replied they are gone and no longer accuse me. What did Jesus said? Neither do I accuse you. Go and sin no more. If Jesus being Holy chose to not accuse that girl, showing her mercy and forgiveness. Why should you condemn me? To use your own words. And to rephrase another famous parable, why do you look at the speck in my eye and not the Beam in yours. Now let me talk from my own experience, when accusing others of sin. Yet being unable to control your own. You don't show yourself as a true representatitive of your faith. Instead you look as though all the rules apply to us and not to you. Specially when in your eyes your sins are forgiven. You are judging, instead of role modeling charity, mercy, love, and forgiveness. Show me your faith by your works, not by your words. 
And please, I implore you read the gospel."
excatholic,fms6lef,t1_fmonfg1,1586348134.0,"When it's voluntarily embraced and not socially enforced or demanded there is no problem in my view about being single. When it is due to some personal, natural, or reasonable reason that you are unable to date then I have no problem with that. When as an institution the Catholic church pressures, Coerce, shame, and force gay men and women to stay celibate as pre-condition to enter heaven not to mention to not be denied the Eucharist (not unheard of) if they become openly, unrepentantly gay. Now that is something I take umbrage at, you can date again when this is over. I am not even supposed to gather with other gay men or have platonic gay friends where I can get non-penetrative intimate contact to satisfy my desire for close bonding. I can have it if I lie, but the Catechism says that any behavior that attempts to find loopholes againsts required celibacy or any duplitious acts are entirely opposed to Catholic dogma and demands of celibate life.

I know, I used to be Catholic and I desperately wanted to stay Catholic. But there is really no other way around. Catholicism is not good for me. It's unnatural."

excatholic,fld1ojz,t1_fld0vbs,1585054161.0,"Then you haven't read Your Catechism and are also inferring too much from a half serious post. That is also pointing out the very real teachings of the RCC about homosexuality. You are expected to live celibate lives, no intimate touching another man, no dating, no kissing, no expression of love for another man is allowed for another gay man 

""Homosexuals and Chastity

2359 Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.
Conjugal Love

2360 Sexuality is ordered to the conjugal love of man and woman. In marriage the physical intimacy of the spouses becomes a sign and pledge of spiritual communion. Marriage bonds between baptized persons are sanctified by the sacrament""



And here is a specific quote about half assing chastity

2338 The chaste person maintains the integrity of the powers of life and love placed in him. This integrity ensures the unity of the person; it is opposed to any behavior that would impair it. It tolerates neither a double life nor duplicity in speech.

 Don't speak from Authority when you don't have a leg to stand on. Most of us here have studied religion, Catholicism, and it's texts and doctrines extensively while trying to shore up our faltering faith."
