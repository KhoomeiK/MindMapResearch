Feeling hopeless in the economy, friendships and relationships is definitely something I've felt all at once too. Just ride it out man and fuck the people that make you feel bad. That's how I'm getting through my 20s. Honestly if you keep giving respect to people who dont respect you, you are disrespecting yourself by association. Fuck everyone and do you man. You'll get through this. And congrats on getting a degree! That is definitely gonna take you very far once things start to get back to normal. Also, I'm sure you'll find better friends, you just gotta really work on putting yourself out there and making yourself available. I know because I was basically in the same situation as you 2 years ago, minus the pandemic. But that will pass too. If you have to move out, it's not the end of the world. It's just temporary until you can get your feet on the ground."

I try to just have fun with it and not care if it sucks or not. If you put in the work and keep adding to your tracks, you will 100% of the time end up with a full track. Whether it sucks, or is a waste of time, is up to you. But if your end goal is to make a track, sticking with it and continuously adding things to it is always going to help. And if you think it sucks, move on to a new track. Sometimes having a new foundation makes the process a lot more easy and fun. Starting over can be discouraging too, but if you think of it as a learning process then you are always making progress!"
