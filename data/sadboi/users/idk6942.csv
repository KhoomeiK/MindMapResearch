SuicideWatch,fpig52c,t1_fpiepb1,1588640214.0,Thank you for your comment it means a lot truly you are appreciated I have spoke with many professionals from therapists councilors and psychiatrists all have encountered problems with me they couldn't solve and passed me off to some one else I was on many medications up till about 3 months ago when I stopped them all off then at first it was awful my body had become physically addicted to them and it felt as tho i had gone cold turkey on heroin I'm am now on a few new medications as I refused to be out bk on the old stuff I'm on mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and anti depressants now with some seditives as well i am continuing to stay on these but I'm 16 I don't want to be drugged up because no one can handle my problems that is why I always turn to myself to fix everything myself and tonight I hit rock bottom once again and decided to turn to reddit so I could speak about my problems annoymously with out feeling like a burden on peoples shoulders everything you imagine my disorders to course is correct the voices and demons I face on a daily basis never give me a second peace the mix of my mood and personality changes constantly and my PTSD leads to sleepless nights trust issues and relationship problems I feel like I will never get over at this point im staring at enough pills to kill me 3x over and your reply and someone else who has direct messaged me is the main reason there still on my desk sitting next to me and not in my liver slowly killing me I honestly do appreciate you and if you want to talk about your disorder I'm happy to talk to you about it either here in the comments or on direct message
