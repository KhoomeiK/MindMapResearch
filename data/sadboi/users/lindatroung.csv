mentalhealth,fox7pdq,t3_ga2fqv,1588136153.0,"i relate to this, my past breakup ended in me feeling the same way you do and its totally normal to feel the way you're feeling. i want you to understand one thing: this wasn't 100% your fault but i can see why you would think this way. i see it like this: **it takes two to tango.** relationships usually end because of both sides, not just one person (with some exceptions of course). though you admitted your faults (which you are very courageous of doing), she must've also had some cons to her that lead to the relationship ending. as cliche as it sounds, nobody is perfect. and not to mention, nobody deserves to feel pain you're feeling. i feel like what made me feel better was made to make a list of all of the other persons cons, so when you start to blame yourself and get overwhelmed you can always look back on the list you made for a reminder that there were bad things from the other part of the relationship (you can even put the smallest little things that irritated you from the relationship). sorry if this is all love the place this is my first time giving a big response like this. im wishing you the best :)"
