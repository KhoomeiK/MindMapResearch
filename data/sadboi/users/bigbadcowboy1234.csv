I have an undergraduate degree, tho college was hard undiagnosed. im 24F just got diagnosed a few weeks ago. But with that, ive bounced around multiple jobs and lived and worked in multiple states chasing different momentary ideas for something I could potentially see myself spending the rest of my life doing, and I always get to my next destination and then start thinking about what‚Äôs next because this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúit‚Äù or it turns out to be a job I‚Äôm not so passionate about. Ive had customer service jobs, worked with case managing, volunteer outreach, had a position in drug abuse prevention, and other experiences like that. I wonder about community education sometimes. I definitely don‚Äôt like working in offices, and I probably would work better if I could somehow employ myself. Sometimes I wanna open my own bakery, or teach myself computer based skills like graphic design that would allow me to freelance and work from home. Idk, lol. Were both pretty young and havent figured it out. People keep telling me to relax about it but I‚Äôm kinda hellbent on this idea that the ideal job I could be passionate about and enjoy doing for the rest of my life exists...just hope I can figure it out soon lol. Good luck to you! Sorry for the rambling. Also would like to add the podcast ADHD for smart ass women by tracy otsuka  on spotify is pretty dope!"

I could be way off but maybe seeing a therapist could help, ive recently started and its been helping me. I have a lot of rumination issues that I‚Äôve been working on as well.

Edit Maybe try looking into mindfulness and meditation as well."
