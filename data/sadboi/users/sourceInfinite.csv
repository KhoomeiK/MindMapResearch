vegan,f59jhkt,t3_dn71at,1572090528.0,"You are awesome. We have all come from a place of being brainwashed into believing eating meat and eggs and dairy was healthy and normal.

 I never really thought about veganism before I changed, so I never argued with anyone about it. But one day my youngest daughter came out of her room after watching Cowspiracy: she'd been vegetarian for six years at this point, she was crying and she was not going to have any of the ricotta/spinach cannelloni I had just spent a good hour preparing for her.

I didn't react well. I had spent that hour preparing a meal for my girl that was up until that point her favourite. 

From that day on I learnt how to make vegan meals. I learned that it wasn't hard. I began to enjoy it. I stopped eating eggs first, meat next and then dairy. My partner did too. In fact when I told him I would keep making him omni meals separate from mine and my daughters he said no, he would go vegan. Within two weeks of my daughter, we were there also.

We haven't looked back once in nearly three years. My husband has turned around his high blood pressure and is healthy.

veganrecipes,f559o3n,t3_dmsjvi,1572003144.0,"My partner and I had been going to some friends' for dinner for a while and due to all our different dietary requirements we had typically just ordered in takeaway that met all the requirements. 

Not long after my partner and I had gone vegan we were invited to dinner again and expected the same, since at that early stage we hadn't actually told anyone we had made that change. 

We walked in the door and the host was cooking dinner. We were briefly concerned until she announced that it was vegan. We hadn't told her, she had deduced it from social media posts she had seen us make. No fuss whatsoever. She added a non vegan protein to her own meal. Too fricking easy. 

That is how to host a meal for friends."
BipolarReddit,f4uttio,t3_dluqn9,1571828706.0,"I agree with the other people who have replied - opt out for a time.

Initially it was the obvious energy vampires who had always been there, my mother, my aunt. Then I ended my marriage. Then I cut ties with friends who judged me for putting my needs first. I have no regrets for making these changes. In fact I feel liberated.

In regards to all of those important issues you are concerned about: for your own sanity give yourself some balance. Be educated for sure but give yourself some space to be free of the feeling that you need to fight for every cause. You are awesome in your awareness of what needs to be changed in this world but you are also needing to be cherished and nourished and loved. You don't need a car crash. You are enough. You are perfect. Just be you.

It's not about feeling things that I am anxious about and I don't try to analyze the cause. This is just how my body is. I am often surprised at how often people on this sub talk about mental reasons for the anxiety. For me it is physical first and situational subsequently. For instance: I might cross a road and have anxiety doing so. There is no reason to feel that anxiety, it just happens. In subsequent occasions when I cross the same road the anxiety appears again simply because it happened once before. I don't know if this is how others experience anxiety, but this is my experience.

In forty days when you are back home you might regret not appreciating the little things about being in the states that you don't have at home. Maybe journal about what you DO like about being there as a way of distracting yourself from what you are missing.
