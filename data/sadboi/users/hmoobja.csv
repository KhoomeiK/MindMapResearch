Granblue_en,fr13fyq,t1_fr10sk6,1589812509.0,Okay thanks for the info. I’ll aim for that class.
Granblue_en,fr0zu5u,t3_glm7mb,1589810431.0,Is there a class I should be aiming for as a beginner? I been using healer class since I only have one other healer unit. I’m mostly fire units atm so not much variety in element.
wotv_ffbe,fqpokvv,t3_gk45el,1589550995.0,Wow looks awesome! Surprise she was shy to post this.
Granblue_en,fqnuibc,t1_fqmo9v8,1589501651.0,Oh okay. That’s a very good tip and I’ll make sure to do that. It can be any banner? Any character you recommend? Thanks for the information much appreciated
Granblue_en,fqlwuwb,t1_fqlmhkr,1589467540.0,Thanks I’ll most likely do that. I haven’t really done much as of yet.
Granblue_en,fqljwjd,t1_fqliwgf,1589459999.0,Oh okay thank for the tip. Was a bit overwhelm when I started last night. I guess I’ll focus on story mode at the moment and go from there.
Granblue_en,fqliims,t3_gh8dw9,1589459001.0,Hi I just started the game last night. Should I be drawing for weapons or saving for special event?
wotv_ffbe,fqiuvuf,t1_fqhpb60,1589401208.0,Yeah no ones going to Manuel play this for that many books lol. I get the lv requirement though should have 80+ unit. Pretty lame content though.
EpicSeven,fqhv14r,t3_giwuk2,1589385086.0,You the real MVP! ✊
EpicSeven,fqhuu4k,t3_gimwfu,1589384989.0,This meme is too much Hahahaha... 😂🤣😂🤣
LogHorizon,fqchrwi,t3_ghtdhw,1589258550.0,Shiroe is my fav. His knowledge of the game and expertise makes him very unique.
DeathStranding,fqbydmb,t3_ghqfsp,1589246372.0,Wow that’s crazy. Looks dope though total different game it seems haha
DeathStranding,fpvseeu,t3_gfozez,1588950977.0,Wow that’s amazing! I need to get back to testing out this photo mode. Been seeing so many awesome pictures
wotv_ffbe,fpcrp90,t3_gcjnwy,1588510805.0,I don’t have him but find fighting him has been mix. I do find his range is quite good. I think once people start getting better armor and weapons I can see him being a pain in pvp. Aoe hollow bolt can pretty much win a match if the AI positions too close. Doesn’t have to kill but enough dmg to turn the tide of battle. He’s done that to me couple of times lol.
DeathStranding,fpcqzw7,t3_gcg2fx,1588510216.0,Lol awesome picture
AnthemTheGame,fpcquk9,t3_gcbs9a,1588510091.0,Nice. Love the gameplay I’m patiently waiting for 2.0 lol.
thedivision,fp72tzq,t1_fp6ntwl,1588363023.0,Lol 😂
wotv_ffbe,fp6lk4o,t1_fp4wvei,1588354419.0,Lol 😂
wotv_ffbe,fp6lgk3,t1_fp5f7au,1588354370.0,I find WOTV would of been a pretty good sequel if they fully developed it into a real game. I actually like the class system and sub jobs. But gacha makes that money lol
FFBEWoV,fp54mdk,t3_gb12vk,1588316138.0,"For orlandeau unfortunately not. I do believe you get some from doing the event EX-quest line. I can’t remember how many though. But it’s limited so you’ll have to make sure you buy them in the event shop. Should be 120 shards for 6k visiore if I remember correctly.

The rest are from refreshing the normal shop and hope his shards pop up to buy. Lucky you’ll see them in the whimsy shop too. Pretty much pray for good RNG. Kind of sucks imo. But if you can at least LB3 him youll have access to all skills on panel. Good luck!"
wotv_ffbe,fp2k9bf,t3_ga9tf0,1588263198.0,Multi kick option is by far my most want. Farming multi has been painful. Lucky to get a group where everyone readys up constantly.
wotv_ffbe,fp2alth,t3_gaozkr,1588258364.0,Ramada is probably my favorite and love her character. Very wise and spiritual. But I’m not building her though with all that said hahah 😂
wotv_ffbe,fp28k1h,t3_garn33,1588257265.0,Damn. I have 100 from shop refresh. I should be able to LB4 him if I actually pull him hahah..
wotv_ffbe,fovmauk,t1_fovj8la,1588103723.0,Seriously they could of waited till after FFT lol. But nope. I been getting nothing in the shop. Freakin engelbert always pops up in my whimsy shop too haha...
thedivision,fov5jdt,t1_fotmpmy,1588095727.0,I didn’t know that was the loot. Yet to try it but might be an incentive to give it a go.
wotv_ffbe,founs89,t1_fotvof7,1588087388.0,Going to LB his LB lol
wotv_ffbe,fop22bf,t1_fomj8dd,1587951365.0,Yeah thats also my problem I have her awaken 4 and LB2 before this FFT event. So now I can’t even buy her shards because I’m shopping for Ramza. Need 215 for full LB. The irony lol
wotv_ffbe,folwyjy,t1_folw9kk,1587872482.0,Ah okay. Whew that’s a close call. I was thinking crap I already unlike divine protection lol 😂
wotv_ffbe,folvmwk,t3_g86vwj,1587871561.0,Isn’t divine protection a passive skill? Do you mean divine grace?
thedivision,foj86i1,t1_fnz2y16,1587812208.0,Lol. I did the same. I was thinking wow 6pc classified looks badass haha...
wotv_ffbe,foj7gyx,t1_foj6hqj,1587811416.0,And xiza lol. Both of them always in my shops and whimseys. Frustrating haha
wotv_ffbe,foiipua,t3_g7j52l,1587787626.0,Yes!! I agreed. It would of been awesome to have voice acting lol.
wotv_ffbe,fofq471,t1_foe1vqm,1587740810.0,Imma try that today. Never thought about that lol
interestingasfuck,fo6tbso,t1_fo2xyeh,1587566338.0,Yeah pretty nuts lol. Imagine if he had Sams suit 🤯
thedivision,fo4n44g,t1_fo4liv2,1587507444.0,💯
wotv_ffbe,fo4k2k3,t1_fo3gv56,1587505851.0,💯
wotv_ffbe,fo22l57,t1_fo0t92g,1587447822.0,Yeah I find AOJ more pleasant and insightful with his information.
wotv_ffbe,fnrip1a,t3_g3gktz,1587190171.0,3rd try and then after that I didn’t see him again lol. Yeah imma just do Ramza step up pull and hope I get him in those 3 tries haha 😂
thedivision,fnq5skt,t1_fnp8tlb,1587158221.0,Yeah I agreed. Random matchmaking no point CCing if group can’t kill them all. I’ve had that at times as well so I would switch to DPS like you did lol
wotv_ffbe,fnozl81,t1_fnon9d7,1587136585.0,Haha I’m down for that lol.
wotv_ffbe,fnl9l3j,t3_g26dm4,1587049588.0,I’m waiting quietly for Ramza hahah.. wish we had delita though such an awesome character
thedivision,fnilemv,t3_g1o94f,1586982024.0,Yeah i ran into that a few times. I just treat everyone the same. As long they chill on the mic that’s kind of all that matters tbh lol.
wotv_ffbe,fne0lis,t3_g0v4gz,1586880937.0,Yeah after your three free recharge don’t watch those fucken ads. Lol. I learn my lesson after doing it the first time haha
DeathStranding,fndr35n,t3_g0zwtc,1586875881.0,That’s  part of the experience traversing all the different terrains while enjoying all its beauty.
thedivision,fmohndq,t1_fmo0n4c,1586259275.0,That’s pretty much any gaming community in today’s time unfortunately.
FFBEWoV,fm7g2hi,t3_ftgy7k,1585825680.0,Better to reroll for him while you haven’t started playing. No other way to get him unless you pull him later down the road by chance.
FFBEWoV,flseb4d,t1_fls7lbo,1585440203.0,Ahhh I see. Hmmm so many hard decisions. I think I’ll use both lol. Seems long distance atks are very useful in the game and they both have long range and healing. Thanks for the info though made my decision a bit easier
FFBEWoV,fls6zde,t1_flre5nt,1585435689.0,Do you know if she’s a good healer? I have her as well. Healing seems to be hard without ayaka.
FFBEWoV,flqre90,t1_flpnr1e,1585404247.0,"Yeah it makes them have quicker turns.,"
EpicSeven,fln4b9w,t3_fph2bp,1585308630.0,Wth hahah.. I was not expecting that. Nice surprise though and I’ll be banning tam from now on 😂
FFBEWoV,fln42te,t3_fpn1ey,1585308398.0,Keep imo lol. Pretty damn good
FFBEWoV,fln3u9o,t3_fpp0kh,1585308165.0,I watch “AOJ” on YouTube since he’s playing Jap server. He does a lot of in depth videos to help out global players. You got two of the 4 UR he recommends so you good lol. Just fill in your other two slots and keep using mont as your tank. I’m using Phoebe she’s an SR time mage and have her using haste. It’s super good!!! Lol
FFBEWoV,fln3mi0,t3_fpput5,1585307944.0,From what I’ve gather it’s best to focus on mediena as your only UR and then have lower tier units to fill in the other 3 slots. Mont is supposedly really good since he has the paladin class as well to tank. Later at endgame you’ll have more resources to upgrade the rest of the UR units. Makes sense since you get more copies of MR and SR units.
FFBEWoV,fln3e3r,t3_fppyat,1585307691.0,It’s not too bad imo. I like the the complexity but I can till it’s going to be a grind lol. Similar to when I play GBF.
thedivision,flfi2z9,t3_foacws,1585107139.0,Yeah surprisingly I’m enjoying it as well. Much better than all the speed run last week
thedivision,fl6w90t,t3_fmpjip,1584885385.0,Yeah you have to be the one burning and killing elites. I just wipe at federal bunker and repeat the boss fight. Most boring shit ever lol. Should of been burn any and kill any elite not just outcast.
thedivision,fl5c70o,t3_fmgyi7,1584833332.0,Lmao 😂
DeathStranding,fkvqof4,t3_fkw0jq,1584574711.0,Lol I wish I was lock at home playing this game right now
EpicSeven,fkqsvp5,t1_fkqdrnw,1584454786.0,Wow that’s really bad rng for 140 ML summons. I usually will do a regular covenant summon sessions and get lucky. My last 3 ML were from there. ML bookmarks I also have no luck since last summer lol 😂
EpicSeven,fkqs5oz,t3_fk432u,1584454310.0,Be awesome if it was a new unit like SSbellona and not just the skin. But I’m pulling her this time for sure lol.
thedivision,fkphu8u,t3_fjp04u,1584410506.0,Yeah compare to D1 these backpacks are a bit ugly to look at lol. But I suppose we need enough space for toilet paper as well not just ammo.
thedivision,fkpgasp,t3_fjlo82,1584409466.0,Yeah I solo that shit on hard today took me an hour and a half. That mortar part was a total pain in the ass. You can even dodge it. You get stagger now matter what you do. I do have to say though it was very challenging first time playing that mission. I didn’t realize it was going to be that difficult otherwise I would of done it on normal lol 😂
DeathStranding,fkpcw9y,t3_fjqi56,1584407127.0,Sad but truly amazing photo.
thedivision,fknd7vx,t1_fkla26v,1584362547.0,I find it heals my team very well and gives me a chance to tank out of cover with my shield. But the cool down is broken at times which I also find a pain in the ass lol. The revive hive esp the cool down is always bug out.
thedivision,fkkd97p,t1_fkj9dvg,1584281125.0,You the real MVP!
thedivision,fkiwfcg,t3_fiqb58,1584230241.0,Right here! Having a blast and farming exotics. Been lucky last few days with some god roll drop.
thedivision,fkgswo9,t1_fkejq3v,1584172703.0,Savage haha 😂
EpicSeven,fka7lxp,t3_fhaqa4,1583995584.0,I bought it already and yeah lesser charm lol. Wtf haha..

thedivision,fk2qa20,t1_fk2gun5,1583806678.0,Lol 😂
DeathStranding,fjwrg6m,t3_fev8my,1583643873.0,Damn. I give him props. Hope he had some ladders pave out from other porters to help his journey.
thedivision,fjodqep,t3_fefbyy,1583525706.0,Lol must of been a stressful extraction 😂
thedivision,fjl290a,t1_fjj4o70,1583438515.0,Yeah I played with few ransoms last night facetanking and no use of cover lol.
EpicSeven,fjfcoqo,t3_fd5k4a,1583289050.0,I know the feels. Sadly I got her after tammarine and angelic montmo lol.
EpicSeven,fjfcfbo,t1_fjf1ix0,1583288894.0,I usually have her use arky if she’s debuff. Then use diene or angelic montmo to remove the debuff right after. Haven’t had much issues with Karkanis. I did just started using ssBellona to replace dizzy and that seems to be working well and also faster kill.
EpicSeven,fiz3gsi,t1_fiz1hxy,1582853252.0,Lmao 😂
EpicSeven,fiw904g,t1_fiurkzi,1582778268.0,Exact same team I run. It’s the most balance and kills both hellraid bosses super easily
EpicSeven,fic64o6,t1_fibttue,1582338563.0,Yeah he went for it lol 😂
EpicSeven,fi9ksis,t3_f6uv0g,1582269708.0,Agreed love this update. Allows so much freedom to farm in this game
CaliforniaForYang,fi9kgxx,t3_f6pfxt,1582269324.0,I’m voting Andrew yang still.
LogHorizon,fi9kfeu,t3_f71qyz,1582269275.0,I’m just excited for season 3. Personally wouldn’t mind a new OP
DestinyTheGame,fhnz240,t3_f3r4n6,1581736342.0,Congrats! I remember beating leviathan raid with my cousins was such an amazing experience. I’ve only beaten two raids in my destiny lifetime but it’s definitely the highlight of the game. Like you took us a whole month as well we all have obligations and them with kids. Again congrats to you guys!
YangForPresidentHQ,fhd8ku1,t1_fhcrw29,1581479727.0,I agreed we have to keep the momentum going. Have to support yang like candidates. UBI will be topic of discussion moving forward
YangForPresidentHQ,fgvf8ny,t1_fgvagta,1581147798.0,You sound like the joker lol. But yeah I agreed. Sick of the DNC. Not a trump supporter but I understand why his supporters voted for him. Feel like I’m in a South Park episode  voting for a turd sandwich or a douche.
YangForPresidentHQ,fgvdu3k,t1_fgv6cl6,1581146065.0,I thought the same as well. Like he had an edge to his answers tonight which I liked. I must of viewed it differently from others who were diss appointed.
YangForPresidentHQ,fgvd63s,t3_f0lq5g,1581145278.0,I agreed. Been talking to older voters about Andrew Yang. It’s odd they all like him but won’t vote for him. Tbh his msg is great but it’s like beating on a dead horse. Drives me crazy to convince voters that UBI is good esp implementing the VAT which I think is great! Anyways don’t have to cut him slack but also let’s keep pushing forward. Don’t get down on ourselves and the yanggang. Donate if you can as well. Imma see it to the very end. Yanggang till it’s over!
EpicSeven,fgvbx04,t3_f0dgww,1581143859.0,My god 😋😋😋
EpicSeven,fgiioei,t3_eyhjbc,1580822807.0,The graphics and animations are my favorites of any other gacha games. Keeps me pushing forward but at a slow pace. I don’t binge farm anymore and it’s been a good choice.
EpicSeven,fg5gyjv,t3_ewksoh,1580527194.0,Omg lol.
EpicSeven,ffkpqjp,t1_ffkdv8r,1580026745.0,Team 3 by far is the best. Also good on morale as well.
DeathStranding,ffk1sct,t3_etsmb9,1580013181.0,One of the most breath taking scene in the game!
AnthemTheGame,ffk1j54,t3_eto5bm,1580012962.0,Love it!
EpicSeven,ffberng,t3_esly9v,1579762155.0,Wow 😳
EpicSeven,ffbecrm,t3_esit8i,1579761680.0,Bruh. Why are you using arbiter vildred? Everyone knows he’s the worst unit in the game. S3 reset if it kill is totally useless. It never kills. Reviving is pointless with extinction units. S1 hits only two units and not four. You been playing the game totally wrong. Should give me your account so you can restart and reroll for a better unit. Don’t waste your time with Avildred.
introvert,ffbdoog,t3_escvg7,1579760924.0,No doubt that I feel the same way. It just allows me to rejuvenate and gather myself before taking on the next day.
EpicSeven,ff7whq4,t1_ff4f0an,1579660016.0,He’s just a total beast in all content. Pretty much the best unit in the game overall imo.
EpicSeven,ff7vy5f,t1_ff7111k,1579659643.0,Lol 😂
DeathStranding,fem5ve1,t3_ep5xmg,1579240841.0,Emails are great and actually wish there was more lol. Interviews I can see some players being overloaded by it. It’s a ton of information about the games story and character. Would of rather them do cutscenes during the game instead. But I personally enjoyed them both.
DeathStranding,fem5fcw,t3_ep3bl5,1579240391.0,I actually wish there was more emails that was one of my favorite parts of the game. Seeing how everyone was doing while I was out delivery stuff.
DeathStranding,fdb3is4,t3_ekeere,1578253288.0,Gz. Beautiful spot esp for the first time!
