RandomKindness,f0ws4r8,t3_d6y5lu,1569012980.0,"Hi OP, I‚Äôm a teacher in NYC. I don‚Äôt work in a classroom, though. I go to infants and toddlers homes and work on developmental goals. All of the children I work with have special needs(language delays, motor delays, Autism, etc) and they life in low-income areas. I bring my own toys but I‚Äôm running low on toys and money right now. 50 dollars would mean a pack of crayons, a puzzle or two and some books! Thanks for your consideration! 

Winky"

Teachers,erqf2ou,t3_c3af4v,1561141869.0,"I‚Äôm writing year end reports and I‚Äôm not allowed to write what actually happened. I teach 2 and 3 year olds and this year we experienced lots of biting, spitting, throwing, hitting etc and even though it is developmentally appropriate behavior for the most part I‚Äôve been told not to include it. To make matters worse, I‚Äôm expected to write flowery bullshit to make each child sound like the happiest most engaged child even if all they did was push a school bus back and forth. 

I have 7 more days here but I feel like I might explode!"
