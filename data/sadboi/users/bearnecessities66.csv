IdiotsInCars,fpdcvls,t1_fpcbm4t,1588524497.0,"I was in a similar situation. Driving on a 4 lane divided highway at night in Saskatchewan. The highways here don't have entrance ramps or exit lanes outside of the few cities, grid roads just meet the highway with a stop sign, and a paved area between either direction of traffic if you have to turn left onto the highway. 

Anyway I was driving in the left lane of my side of the highway when I saw headlights up ahead. At first I didn't think anything of it, I assumed there was a slight bend in the road up ahead and it was an illusion that made it look like someone in the oncoming lanes was directly ahead of me. But the lights got brighter and there was no bend so I switch to the right lane and a couple seconds later a pickup truck goes flying by me in the lane I was just in at 110km/hr. 

I'm assuming the guy was drunk (Sask. has the highest rates of drunk driving in Canada) and turned left onto the highway from one of those grid roads, but didn't remember to cross the highway to the proper lanes and instead turned left into the oncoming traffic. I called it into the RCMP but I didn't see anything in the news the next day about a collision."

regina,fe9a675,t1_fe88jmw,1578935764.0,I wasn't saying we should use it here. I said that that's what's used in areas of Ontario with higher snowfall accumulation to melt it away. Plus that only applies to regular rock salt. There are other formulations that are effective to much lower temperatures.
regina,fe86hdp,t1_fe62i41,1578923077.0,I think one of the worst intersections in the south is the 4 way stop at 25th Ave and Argyle Rd/Retallack St. It's so busy that the road has just been worked down to ice at the intersection. I wouldn't mind if that was changed to a stop light.
