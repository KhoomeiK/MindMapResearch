WaltDisneyWorld,fklup67,t1_fkl43l1,1584315001.0,Actually in the midst of joining my local union in PA. This would be like a few years down the road. Once I complete an apprenticeship I should be able to transfer to one of the local unions in FL
WaltDisneyWorld,fklujis,t1_fklj0pu,1584314903.0,So they dont employ one specific company or anything like that?
SpeakerPorn,fi61okr,t1_fi5ijoe,1582176172.0,Thanks again !
ptsd,fhjts3i,t1_fhimwys,1581655373.0,That's about what I figured. It all seems pretty rough just want to know what to brace for
Lovecraft,ffx69yr,t3_eve46v,1580318641.0,I have this exact collection and I love it
NZXT,ffm7ix1,t3_cs6oh7,1580049780.0,Does the 2 rgb port become an issue with using a kraken cpu cooler?
grandson,fcp28qg,t1_fcozlov,1577848240.0,Fair enough mate. Cheers and have a good new year
grandson,fcoynml,t1_fcoygrn,1577845230.0,Yeah but everyone around me still calls them vinyls lol. Either way didn't answer the question
Carpentry,fbah428,t3_eccisb,1576678005.0,Outside of scraping them and making them again I suppose you could use bondo and then paint it. But with that much of a gap you'd definently have it crack as the house goes through seasons
oblivion,f9gptxq,t1_f9gdmju,1575302999.0,Everything is easy using the invisibility armor. Enchant 5 pieces of armor and rings with 20 percent chameleon and run around unnoticed. Only time some interacts with you are for scripted encounters
oblivion,f9gplia,t3_e4zmbt,1575302902.0,Ayy congrats I have been playing for years and only very recently went back through to get 100%
bodymods,f78he1y,t1_f789p2s,1573493180.0,So it kinda like a skin tunnel going through? If you take the plug out would it eventually heal into a normal sack again? (Sorry I'm a very curious person)
bodymods,f789p2s,t3_dusvf8,1573488667.0,If you take out the plug is it just an open whole in your scrotum or does the skin heal around the plug and form a channel? I dont know much about these. Like if you take that out are you at risk of popping one of your testes out of the scrotum?
Carpentry,f21qt3m,t1_f21k84m,1569875555.0,This seems pretty good. Plus the 2000 is rounded up 3 times materials which means it's not too bad off
grandson,f14dono,t1_f146a0p,1569172939.0,Mine either I went to the New York show

BethesdaSoftworks,evwchpl,t1_evwccce,1564860645.0,When they added backwards compatibility with oblivion I was soooooo hype
ptsd,eufc46f,t1_eueum02,1563768968.0,Thank you! I feel you on the time dilation it would be bad enough feeling this way but it worse since its passing by so much slower.
ptsd,eueocgv,t1_euenwpk,1563749493.0,Is this a suggestion you have tried? Has this worked for you?
ptsd,eueju9y,t1_euebcvd,1563746167.0,"I have to agree with this, we cannot diagnose you this subreddit is more for support than for diagnosing. That being said I'm very sorry to see someone else go through this. Take this advice and go start seeing someone. You might not think itll catch up to you but it will."
Lovecraft,esygf0x,t1_esyeu4g,1562343207.0,Thank you! I actually really appreciate this it's very helpful!
Lovecraft,esy6fqi,t3_c922j5,1562339628.0,"Both are fantastic. I am not very far in SC yet but I can already tell it's much more true to lovecraft than COC. However I think COC did the investigation and finding things bits a tad better. But there so much more of SC. Honestly depends on what you're looking for. 

The COC is good, slow starting, but a great game with great atmosphere and give you the feeling that your choices matter. Although could have been better if it had been given more works. 

The SC is fantastic and well designed and true to Lovecraft, the investigative bits are a bit repetitive, and the combat system is unforgiving. The open world is great and the game is fantastic at giving you false sense of security which adds to the lovecraftian fear of the unknown."
ptsd,esfdxsa,t3_c7fqs8,1561923679.0,Thank you for sharing this. Too many people don't get this. It affects so many things.

SuicideWatch,erhvj3k,t1_erhtqbp,1560883790.0,"I went through life and I saw positive people that had their own issues and seeing them get through their shit helps me too. Like I have this best friend and he had a lot of problems years ago, and obviously still does (just kinda a fact with mental illness) but we always helped each other out when we were feeling down. He understands me when I ghost  or call off plans and he's always understanding. 

You kinda just find people that are equally fucked up in the head and having that in common with someone ironically bonds you"
