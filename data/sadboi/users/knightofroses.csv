I've accidentally tipped my girlfriend over the edge by trying to comfort her that way when she was dealing with her body dysphoria, but once I sat down with her and cleared it up she was much more understanding and she told me better ways to reassure her so there wouldn't be any misunderstandings.

I know that BPD can drive us up the wall, but being able to rationalize things and distract yourself is a very important part of being in a relationship with someone while you're learning how to handle your bpd.

It helps to talk to your partner too. It really helps. Since my boyfriend and I have spoken about my obsessive nature he's been able to talk me down during episodes and help me realize that I can be my own person without needing to be concerned with how my brain thinks he wants me to be.
