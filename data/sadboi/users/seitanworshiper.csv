I turned around to watch the meter go up, and some dude who was parked in a regular parking spot at the convenience store attached had left his truck in neutral somehow, and it was rolling out of the spot and about to directly hit the gas pump I was standing in front of. I had no time to move, I just put my hands up in front of my face and braced for impact. The truck hit the pump and it fell into me, catching on fire at the bottom where the gas line broke. I was pinned down, but had a crazy adrenaline rush and was able to somefuckinghow push the damn thing up high enough for me to slide out and let it fall onto my car (I was an 18 year old, very not fit girl at the time). It hit my car, car caught on fire, and everyone is standing around watching me. I asked if anyone called 911, of course the answer was no (not because it was too long ago for cellphones, it was 2006) so I ran inside WHILE MY CAR WAS ON FIRE and asked the employee for the phone to call 911 and I personally called them my fucking self, and then my dad to come by because it right next to our house. Then some dude with no shoes on tries to ask if I'm ok, turns out it was HIS fucking truck lol 

To top it off, I was just graduated from HS, applying like crazy for jobs. My purse had my cellphone (sweet Sidekick bayBEE) and my social security card in it. When the fire department got there (also luckily literally right across the street, you could see the truck leave the building and cross the street in like 1 min total haha) I begged one of them to go get my bag out of my car before it exploded, I was all good once I had that. My car was totaled and melted and burned but it was only worth about $100 anyway!
