In Islam, Allah/God has said to NOT enter a land during a plague. And if you’re a part of the land during a plague, then you should NOT leave it. Best possible way to explain this would be to just “isolate yourself”. Performing these mass prayers at times like this is a literal sin itself. They are risking each other for danger, as well as their family, and even most of their cities/country itself. I’m pretty sure that Governments and Leaders of all countries have also ordered for some type of quarantine/isolation, which is mandatory to follow according to the Qur’an/Hadith, but this here clearly shows that it’s being violated. Smh, I thought our Government (U.S.A.) was corrupted, but this is MUCH worse."
