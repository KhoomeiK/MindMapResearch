mixer,fbr49qg,t3_d07umz,1577038973.0,Why does the 24 hour timer keep resetting? I mean I started last night at 12:30 am and I am still at 22 hours
JustBootThings,ernavui,t3_c2wsk2,1561048573.0,Someone came into my doctors office wearing a shirt saying this and I immediately thought of this group.
depression,eqtrofm,t1_eqt1lfu,1560317966.0,"Yes. She was way more loving and then she got super sick and her mood tanked. I mean don’t get me wrong I have done my fair share of bullshit (a little job hopping and some crazy mood swings) but it doesn’t excuse her for what’s going on. 

Hahaha I wish I was Keanu Reeves. Lol I’m just a bleeding heart and glutton for punishment."
depression,eqtrhex,t1_eqt19y4,1560317835.0,"I think it’s time to discuss what we are doing. I will try to do it rational. And not overly animated. 

I love you too. I appreciate you being there and commenting. I honestly don’t think I would mind being alone."
depression,eqt06vc,t3_bziunz,1560298555.0,"I do love her. Sad thing is she has a job. She is a bitch. A lot of the time. I just don’t know. Like I used to be so sweet and caring and now I’m just a rude, bothered, shitty, miserable person. It wasn’t like this before. 

I know she would have people take care of her if I wasn’t around. I don’t want to throw in the towel but when is enough."

I'm sorry that is terrible :("
depression,eqss4w6,t1_eqsrcxc,1560292375.0,She does. She is on 2 high dose meds. She always throws in my face that she is sick and that I need to just do what she says and she cant do
depression,eqsr0ps,t1_eqsqvi2,1560291555.0,"Thank you. I don't feel great. I just don't know how much longer I can go doing everything under the sun.

I am thinking we are going to need some help from someone."
depression,eqsqufb,t1_eqsqhg2,1560291425.0,I am currently in therapy for my own bullshit. She is too for hers. She is type A and doesnt take any shit from anyone. She is like a drill sergeant sometimes. I am thinking it is heading to that (divorce). I am going to see when I get home as this was all over text while I am at work.
intermittentfasting,eq4dh56,t3_bx80za,1559774548.0,"I am starting today too. I am so looking forward to this. I think I will try 16:8 first and then if I tolerate it I will do 18:6 or 20:4. I really am stoked about this. And after seeing some of the progress, I am so motivated! Good luck and I look forward to your progress."

And why does it take so long to advance?"
navy,eokcfk9,t3_bs99fg,1558651419.0,"I'm not trying to sound ignorant or stupid, but why is the advancement rates taking so long? What do I not understand? Or I heard something about a quota being released. I'm a little confused."
Paranormal,eokbcpr,t3_bs2010,1558650725.0,Sounds like the plot to The Society on Netflix. Creepy.
depression,eogz2i2,t3_brsy1y,1558568995.0,"Absolutely. It is such a strange feeling. I get really motivated for something, then all of a sudden I feel overwhelmed and stressed about completing it so then I am right back to square one. Hang in there and let me know if you find an answer."

I have been drinking water, eating sensible, and I did 10 push ups last night...I know that doesn't sound like a lot but I haven't done push-ups since I was in high school. I am kicking ass and taking names to get down to what I need to be to join."
depression,eo8yxye,t1_enye4eg,1558378076.0,"I dont think kids are a regret, I am just happy I do not have them right now because I am not prepared and I do not want to make them fat like me with my bad habits. I want to be better so my kids can be the best they can be."
