mentalillness,fpxr4vg,t1_fpvsgx3,1588987890.0,"Sometimes sad music is my only safe space.

There are times when I need to cry but I can't because I learned to keep it all in to adjust to a tough environment.
The sad music enables me to release the pent-up negativities and tension. It sometimes catalyses introspective moments which I find cathartic.

Do you experience similar moments?

nag-withdraw ako from Gcash through Villarica pawnshop dati, Php 60 service charge


rati,kulang ng 500 ang nilabas ng BPI ATM, bad move.na di ako nag-withdraw ulit but chose to report it sa home branch ko right away (a few floors below).. di naman nila naibalik kasi upon investigation kasi wala raw 'sobra' sa machine.at franchise machine daw yung pinag-withdraw-han ko. Sa ATM sa may mall.cinema ako nag-withdraw

ever since, mas pinipili ko nang mag-withdraw sa machines na nasa banks kpag may option.


nagka-error yung CAM ng BPI nung nago-auto deposit ako to BPI Family Savings. ""HARDWARE ERROR"" after ko ipasok yung pera. It took nearly a calendar week to resolve. pambayad ko pa naman ng renta yun. buti nalng mabait landlord ko at di ako sinigil ng penalty kasi techinically na-late payment ako rahil dun sa naglokong CAM machine.

never ko pa NA-XP yung ganun sa deposit machine ng Metrobank.

Unless you're hearing disembodied voices, seeing things that aren't there or other psychosis symptoms, I highly advise that you seek psychological help first before seeing a psychiatrist.

If you're feeling like harming yourself, pls. go to the emergency room of hospitals like UERMMC, may semi-public Psych ward dun."
