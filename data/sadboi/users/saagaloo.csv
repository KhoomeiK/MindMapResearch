Perhaps it's just an interest in languages, but for me the catalyst was video games. I wanted to understand what they were about, what was going on in them, so I kept playing with a dictionary at hand (asked for one for my 8th birthday).

&#x200B;

Then came Lara Croft, and she became a huge role model for me and I wanted to be and sound like her. Finally, I started noticing huge mistakes in Polish 'translations' of games (sometimes pirated ones, using machine translations) and felt this need to 'fix' them. I ended up studying English (translation and teaching) at uni, and gained even more proficiency this way. I lived in England for around 2 years between high school and uni, I can say, being immersed in a language environment is very good - especially if you avoid people who speak your language as crutches/only source of social life.  


Another tongue I speak rather fluently is Dutch. I learned that through immersion and living in a Dutch household... Linguistic knowledge from uni helped me connect a lot of dots in the process but really, just trying, making silly mistakes but keeping on trying is the key. Start small. Small words. Simple sentences. And don't be afraid to speak. If you met a foreigner in your country, trying their damnedest to speak your language, would you look down on them or be glad they're trying? Same applies to you.

&#x200B;

tl;dr - use the language you wish to learn, avoid contact with your home language when abroad, don't be afraid to make mistakes - you'll learn from them and people won't judge you as much as you think."

In the same way Gangrel apparently choose not to walk upright, the Toreador, with their appreciation of art and beauty, act more human than humans do. VV owns quite a big business, a strip club, she's clearly capable of handling various affairs.

And yet she puts on the theatrical hand-to-forehead ""Poor, poor David Hatter"" after we already relieve her of making her hands dirty by taking care of the hunter. She wants to be seen as vulnerable and fragile and is great at putting up that front - I can appreciate that. But let's not forget that we allow our PC to get manipulated by someone who in practice hires us to a) commit a murder b) destroy evidence, but I guess protecting the Masquerade is a good cause...
