CoronavirusIndiana,fl3x5p1,t3_fmf5rb,1584800690.0,"I found this article from the New York Times interesting. They made graphics from available data about state demographics and where it will “peak” depending on what measures we take to distance. If you scroll down, you can see Indiana peaks in mid-May with no measures, but that “flatten the curve” where we shut down most things drags on into the summer. When I read this, I’m inclined to think we will have some limitations through most of the summer, if the middle choice is what our governments are choosing (it seems like it) vs. a total lockdown. You can read the article about where they got the data, but it’s modeled off the standard way diseases run on curves vs. distance measures.

So if the price is right, and you get it inspected and go in eyes wide open, you can also walk into a great deal."

Despite all the evidence that this is would be a terrible, toxic relationship that folks are bringing up, Disney produces a movie that seductively targets and builds a “Reylo” fandom: lighting Adam Driver to look like a Dark Prince in TFA, all the force-Skype sessions in TLJ that are basically sexting innuendos... the story is grooming Reylos from beginning of the story to the very end kiss. Everything from hair and lighting to gazes takes someone looking for a love story down that path. Casting Adam Driver, known for making flawed dudes loveable. And this happens despite all other evidence that it’s an awful, terrible idea. His first major act is killing an old family friend! And what is so unsettling is how Disney targeted that audience, groomed them, and made them - in the middle of a movie that “serviced other audience members” with conflicting story arcs and information, some of which centered around female empowerment and an alternative number of perfectly reasonable, awesome men you could fall for that are -not- Kylo Ren. Then they hoped we’d not question what the hell happened when they kissed and he died... and now it’s the end.

Lamictal was great at shutting down the noise and anxiety that kept me from functioning daily, and Prozac overall lifted my mood. You asked about anxiety.

Then wean yourself off. The reason I bring this up is I know how bad withdrawal can be and was recommended to me not to “cold turkey” due to side effects. My psych once told me that feeling of coming off lamotreigene isn’t necessarily mania... it’s mostly being amped up from missing the meds. Garden variety withdrawal. So if you keep weaning off, keep in mind a lot of it is anxiety and maybe steps to handle anxiety will help. Here’s a link to CVS as a fallback - if it were me, I would probably get a 1x fill and half it over a few weeks to get off.
