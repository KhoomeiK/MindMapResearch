AMA,fguyow3,t1_fguy79u,1581132454.0,"Yes my whole family is Mormon, born and raised in the church. While they are sad I left they love and respect me and we manage just fine.

Not anything in particular, I just have tried to be authentically me.

I had a hard time believing how the church was founded and a lot of the early practices in the church. There‚Äôs also a lot of sexism in the church and teachings that I think are harmful to children especially. Children shouldn‚Äôt be brainwashed into believing but that‚Äôs all the church does.

Life plan now is just to live as I want and try to be a good person

Not really religious anymore, currently trying to figure out if I still believe in a God

Hobbies include hiking, doing digital art, playing my guitar or piano"

AMA,fgjfyz4,t1_fgjf1d4,1580843235.0,Some people like myself want to experience pregnancy and have biological children of their own. Infertility is described as being unable to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of regular unprotected sex. I have been trying for 3 years now but only went to see a fertility specialist towards the end of last year.
AMA,fgjequr,t1_fgjd0yy,1580842502.0,"Not 100% sure what you‚Äôre asking in the first question, but as far as complications, different treatments can have some bad side effects. Most the medication you take affects your hormones and can make you extremely emotional, at least it has been that way for me. I also had severe nausea and headaches from some medication so had to switch medications.

As for my anxiety and depression, I‚Äôve dealt with these for most my life and have been on meds and in therapy for a while. The infertility has definitely amplified these and it‚Äôs been a struggle. I also had to switch medication because what I was on was safe for pregnancy and they treat you like you‚Äôre pregnant while you go through treatment in the case that you do get pregnant. I feel like these new meds aren‚Äôt as helpful but that could also be because of how the fertility meds are affecting me. I‚Äôve been meeting with my therapist more often and trying to find new hobbies to occupy my time which has helped."

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like all I‚Äôve wanted in life is to be a mother and it might not ever happen...
