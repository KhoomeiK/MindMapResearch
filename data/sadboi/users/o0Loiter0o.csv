Anxiety,fo6x8so,t3_fxoae9,1587568422.0,"I wanted to come re-visit this thread because it is so important right now.  So many people I know, even those without diagnosed anxiety disorders, are having physical manifestations of stress and anxiety due to the lockdown.  I have had the following (and at least one other person I personally know has had each of these as well):

* Unexplained upper or lower back pain
* Racing heart
* Increased resting heart rate
* Chills (with no fever)
* Fatigue
* Inability to sleep even when tired

Those are just the ones to came immediately to mind.  We are all going through an unprecedented period of isolation.  I would liken it to a sensory deprivation tank - your mind is used to being entertained, seeing people, socializing, doing stress-reliving activities, etc.  Because it can't do these things now, it is looking for ways to expend energy.  One of the ways it does this is literally creating physical sensations that otherwise wouldn't be there.  Another way is seizing upon sensations that are already there and amplifying them (these are sensations that you otherwise wouldn't have noticed in normal day-to-day life)."

If you look at our curve, it could be a LOT worse.  Virginia retroactively updates the cases based upon when symptoms first began for new positives, so the end of that curve could change.  Still, the growth in cases is not astronomical.

I'm not sure where in Virginia you are but I'm in NOVA, and I know that a LOT of people were telecommuting before any sort of lockdown was ordered.

SSRIs,fl2w0c6,t3_fm2nsg,1584761381.0,"Hey I'm not a doctor but at least the first half of my story sounds similar so I wanted to share it.  I was on Lexapro for about ten years and it worked great most of the time.  During the last couple of years I started to get really irritable and stressed, and started having more and more ruminations.  Eventually I had a panic attack without any of my normal triggers being present (my big thing is getting nervous when I'm hungover).

I was told I needed to switch meds which I was VERY reluctant to do.  It was almost like I was back to the original stigma of meds before I ever took them in the first place.  It's been a rocky road with ups and downs, but here's what I've learned over the past few months:

* Psychotropic medication is a lot of guesswork and trial/error.  I got lucky that my first medication, Lexparo, worked for me, so I never had to learn this the first time around.  But a lot of it is wait and see.
* You're going to have ups and downs when trying a new med - the goal is more good days than bad days, and a general trend towards getting better.
* It can take a med 6-8 weeks to fully kick in.  Would you say you're worse at 2 weeks than you were before you started?  Are you seeing any improvement?  I found it helped me to keep a daily journal of what I was taking, how long I had been on it, and how I was feeling.
* This is where my story differs and you should always take it with a grain of salt: instead of putting me on another SSRI like Zoloft, my doctor put me on new meds that were SSRIs and then something else.  First Viibryd (which I personally did not like) and then Cymbalta (which I'm on now and has been helping me).  When I asked my doctor why he said that, since I had a breakthrough on SSRI that he usually adds something to it to get his patients back on track.  I was thinking we would try Zoloft or Prozac, but now I'm on Cymbalta (and SSRI/SNRI).  Again, your doctor knows you and has a plan for your treatment, so I would trust that.  It might help you to ask some questions so you can understand it however.

tl;dr It could take 6-8 weeks to see the full effects.  If you're at 2 weeks and not feeling better at all, gauge if you're feeling worse and maybe talk to your doctor.

There are SO many drugs/options out there though.  I know this situation sucks/is scary/is frustrating/isn't fair.  Hang in there.  You can do this!"

* My router defaults to [192.168.1.1](https://192.168.1.1) with a [255.255.255.0](https://255.255.255.0) subnet

Here is a really good article on Washington Post with some simplified simulations of how viruses spread.  Some of these simulations show what happens if a virus were allowed to spread unchecked, so please ignore if that sort of thing scares you.  However, they then show other simulations that show how social distancing allows significantly slows down the spread - we're talking a **HUGE** dropoff.  Their simulation also assumes a virus that has a 100% infection rate when coming into contact with a sick person (completely impossible), and social distancing **still** completely dampens the spread.  If you can look past the ~~worst-case~~ impossible-case scenarios, I find this really helpful.

Various reports ([here](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/09/people-shed-high-levels-of-coronavirus-study-finds-but-most-are-likely-not-infectious-after-recovery-begins/) and [here](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)) show that spread of the virus drops off significantly as you progress.  The world is mounting an unprecedented response to stop the spread and countries like South Korea and China (!) are already reporting more recoveries than new cases."
Anxiety,fkkq439,t1_fkkntzk,1584289572.0,Hey!  Just wanted to say that everything is going to be ok.  I'm sure the stores will restock soon.  The initial surge of shoppers definitely put a strain on supplies but that is over and the suppliers/retailers/etc. are sure to get things back in.  We were seeing shortages in my area yesterday and things are already starting to turn around.
VOIP,fkijnx5,t3_fip2or,1584221594.0,Check out RingCentral. A lot of VoIP solutions can do this but I have RingCentral and really like them.
VOIP,fjxq57w,t3_ffdsjy,1583680673.0,"Hey my use case is quite a bit different from yours, but I can say that I tried Grasshopper and RingCentral and that RingCentral is way better. Just looking at your list, they can do a lot of it (not sure on some because they weren't needed for my business). I would give them a call and talk through what you want. Their sales staff is very good at figuring out if you're a good fit and if you sign up, their onboarding is very thorough."
AMA,fjb41qv,t1_fjb1wn4,1583186059.0,That sucks.  Hope you feel better soon.  At least you're immune after this.
AMA,fjayqm8,t3_fcbiaq,1583183152.0,"On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being completely healthy and 10 being the worst cold/flu you've ever had, where does this rank?"
Stress,fhsgmxa,t1_fhs2e0j,1581860637.0,Thanks for that.
RATM,fhj5xr4,t3_f3fhc0,1581638715.0,I live in DC and the non-scalp costs were $125 for stands and $500 for floor. I've seen a lot of people (including Tom) blaming scalpers and wanted to put this out there. They set a price of $500 for the floor tickets.
washingtondc,fh7qzuf,t3_f1oy51,1581342286.0,"If you block a hydrant and it causes property damage, is the punishment still just a ticket?  This is at least as harmful to the public as a DUI, which comes with a loss of license."
SSRIs,fh7qt6a,t3_f1nzhg,1581342132.0,"Hangxiety is one of the reasons I started SSRIs.  As I got used to them, I knew my limited and when I would exceed those limits, I paid for it.  A couple of years ago I doubled that limit at a company Christmas party and had increased anxiety for 2-3 days afterwards.  You're correct that you just need some time for the meds to settle in and for your nervous system to re-balance."
PanicAttack,fgulqxq,t3_f0hh6r,1581123966.0,Just wanted to drop a note saying that I'm pulling for you and that everything is going to be ok!
SSRIs,fgt3raz,t3_f0ctst,1581098427.0,"I don't exaggerate when I say Lexapro saved my life. Helped my general anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks, OCD, and depression.  It's generally very well tolerated too. Every drug is different for every person but if your doctor has prescribed it to you for generalized anxiety it is a great place to start. Good luck with everything."
Anxiety,fgqe3qv,t1_fgq7mpr,1581022419.0,Thanks again.  You rock.
Anxiety,fgq4nro,t1_fgq3qld,1581017795.0,Thank you so much.  I'm glad to hear you were able to push through.  I really want to get regularly into working out since it's the most-recommended treatment for anxiety/depression that I'm not using.  Did you find that it helped you (once you got past the post workout anxiety of course)?
IIFYM,fgnpmc8,t3_ezj0fy,1580950104.0,Chobani non fat Greek yogurt. I eat two a day when doing macros.
