mentalhealth,fqzdrm1,t1_fqy1rkp,1589765243.0,"I understand your concern. It wasn’t appropriate to my liking because I also have issues. I have triggers and that’s fine too! Whenever I see something I do not like, I’m tempted to be very emotional. I didn’t try to say it was inappropriate to trigger you also, but I wanted to show different angles of perception. It can be as simple as this. Life is supposed to be life. Whether you are happy, sad, it’s life and those emotions are there for us to feel. Negative emotions are there for us to explore. To eradicate darkness is impossible as darkness never rests. In a religion sense, there was a time we didn’t know darkness. Adam and Eve invited “sin” into the world. Religion is a stepping stone so it’s okay to be stepped on as it’s a free world. It’s crazy how darkness never rests, yet never rests wins. “Live just because” is a wise angle as darkness never winning is fact. But as a philosopher, keep in mind that even the smallest of statements trigger people. Thank you (:"

Losing love, death, etc. I do not dwell in those fears anymore, but having one fear isn’t rational to me. Fear will find us in strange ways."

I’m 23 with my parents with bi polar and schizophrenia. I was diagnosed at 19, but at 18 I was in college and had to drop out due to symptoms that caused inability to learn and be in public. Psychotic behaviors. What I’ve learned is that handling them alone, encourages a decline in mental state. You are not alone. See your therapist as much as possible. I never saw a therapist. Just psychiatrists to give me medicine. As you can see, I’m stuck in a cycle. Dealing with anything alone is more harsh than you think."

An unfortunate event of a near death experience and an unfortunate trigger of asthma. I’m no expert, but my life’s experience with sadness is eventful. The near death experience was a shock you can admit that. A shock believes to remove the spirit from the body. You’re spirit needs to be grounded. The fact that you thought about the experience, even though it’s so tempting to not think about, means it’s a moment you “recreated” in your imagination. Disconnect from the experience because your soul has returned to you. A shocking moment is not something to dwell. Other emotions can be dwellers, but a shocking moment, especially from near death, is one, if not the most, depressing experience in your life. Be calm and relaxed.
