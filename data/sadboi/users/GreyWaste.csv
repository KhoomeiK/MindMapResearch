DotA2,eyxfcjg,t1_eywm5im,1567551924.0,"As a treant spammer, aghs rushing is stupid and it's an overrated item anyway.

Half decent team cut down pretty much all your eyes their side of the river, the magical damage addition to your ult is negligible at best late game and the vision isn't great anyway without the talent. 

It's never been an item that's ""turned the tide"" of the game for me, it's always ended up being a supplement to a game that already looked like it was going to end up being won, or didn't stop a losing game from being lost."

The problem is having Core MMR and Support MMR.

A competant carry can solo a game with little to no support and a competant selfless support will still lose the game.

Knowing that people will pick carry as a support role till they rank up to the point they can play with competant carrys."

You won't get spin again, arcana or 50 battle levels almost ever (even though there's three on the board)

The odds of those are probably 1% or less, if the wheel was fair it would be 15% chance to get battle levels but it's just another scam like the Slark plinko game that always landed in the lowest reward most of the time and the ball would actually fall through the board if you try and placed in a spot where it was awkward for it to land in the lowest reward."

The recommended item builds don't load half the time and not always good suggestions, just statistically the most likely useful items no matter the draft.  

The ward placement suggestions are obvious anyway, there isn't enough variety in the sets and bought most of the ones I could want in 1 month.   

The Performance chart feels like mostly worthless information and the Damage chart is nowhere near as useful or insightful as an ingame fight recap.  

I literally only buy an odd month of it to use the ingame speech lines to annoy people."

Oh and as for spoilers.

When you go to watch matches from a certain day it's nice that they try to hide spoilers by masking the game length and showing the max amount of games and hiding the result.

But I don't know why they go to all that effort considering how they list the matches.

Example;

It's hard to watch LGD v Liquid semi final playoff in the replays without seeing the OG vs Liquid final above it, not hard to put 2 and 2 together."

I scored 2984 and my friend scored 2875 and we carefully researched our picks and all my gambles on teams who would play more games on a certain day paid off, we're both at the top of our friends lists.

I made top 10% last year and I felt I did better this year, my day 1 picks weren't great but overall I don't think I could've picked much better on the other days, I think if you're scoring more than 3300 your picks were near spot on and you're probably in the 1%"

Alchemist needs a nerf so badly, he farms super fast, he comes online fast, he is strong all game and he gets super big, he's very hard to kill etc...

He used to be somewhat balanced as he used to need a lot of farm to come online, like 30 minutes or so.

These days he can up murdering whole teams by the 18 minute mark and any time he starts dying he just walks away 10 seconds and can come right back in as his ult is like a built in heart of tarrasque. 

If I was facing OG in the final I'd ban the alchemist every game, the IO combi is hard but you can play against it."
