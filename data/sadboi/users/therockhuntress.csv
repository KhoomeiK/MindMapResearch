I have had several trips with my mom, who has severe ms, and i cant tell you how many times i had to go in there and DEMAND that they admit her because she was so sick she wasn't safe at home, and they usually found the problem the next day.  She needs to be admitted for observation, she needs constant hydration until she gets better or they find out what else they can do. I know the hospital is not the best place to be right now. But if her electrolytes get too bad, you're looking at a MESS. Please take her somewhere else, tell them it is your THIRD trip and that she needs help."
