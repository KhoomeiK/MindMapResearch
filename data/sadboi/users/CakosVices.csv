My hppd is getting better, as time passes. I can't guarantee you that your hppd will disappear some day, but I can tell you it gets better with time. Could take a month or 2 years, but at some point hppd is  going to be just something you notice from time to time. My text probably seems odd because I'm very tired, but yea... you seem like a cool open minded dude.

HPPD,f63mx10,t3_dphqb0,1572680065.0,"We are not sure yet what causes it, but we do know that eliminating some bad habits can helps tremendously. As for an exemple, continuous use of cannabis and psychedelics such as LSD, Psilocybe mushrooms, MDMA and sometimes DMT are known to make HPPD way more severe than it has to be...

Many people claim that they don't even notice their hppd symptoms, after a while of abstinence of psychedelics and pot. 

What helps is good hygiene, rich-nutrients foods, multivitamins gummies daily are great too and eating some fish like salmon from time to time, to make sure you aren't deficient in omega 3 fatty acids. Oh and if you can try to avoid anything that contains caffeine in the afternoon.

I know lots of people don't enjoy much exercise, so just something like 2 walks a week can help. 

Best of luck starshine:^]"
