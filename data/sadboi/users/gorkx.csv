TLDR?  No job market.  Why move mid plague? or to here at all. Have kids? The education system ranks close or at bottom of the entire US.

It's close to the same costs of living of bay area california.  I'm  mostly here now because of momentum.  

But do yourself a favor: don't move. much less mid zombie apocolypse. it's  basically all part time residents, finding a job here that pays, much less anything above mediocrity level living sucks a bag of dicks. 

Trust me. the meme ""santa fe city different land of entrapment, and bad cayote art"" isn't just to make fun of the fucking awful bad cayote art. (that to) but it's also true!

I spent years doing amazing meetups, charity stuff, that was a lot of fun and raised a a few bucks. But that's dried up. Why? everyone sane. moved on. Only me left. I guess i'm the nutjob.

That's not depression' That's just a face palm, and possible having your head slamed into a stove or hit upside the head with a frying pan a few times to get over it.

Depression is  more like a mischievius demon, or to go star wars on this: It's more like the dark: Some good (or maybe lots of ) can come out of it. But it's also the risks that just..suck that come with.

I'll site myself as an example. Because of the just...next level...I just don't know what to make of this place everything is in.  And the absolutely surreal...or even beyond surreal place of it all. I hit my wall...again about 4 months ago. That was after I already checked myself into the healthward twice i November and desember. one time because I wanted to try a suppliment to help with recovery for jogging one time. Problem was: I ran on autopilo took 2 or 3 tetra tabs of a med. Then had a god awful alergic reactiction to the sup. Which was bad in of itself. I'd never had an alergic reaction to Golden Root...I didn't know it was possible for to do so since I have a lot over the years. So that sucked and I'm very glad it's not unheard of. I didn't learn my lesson very well because around Jan this year had dangerously bad alergic rection and serotonine syndrom from 5htp and my anti-epressent. So I checked myself into the loony bin for about 5 day days. The pudding? Yummy! Disney plus on some kind of loops on Loony Bin TV? sucks ass.  lol it's not funny but  kind of is that I know this shit.On the other hand I managed to break the nurse and ER tech asking if they called my fam to let them know while I did stupid. that I guess I'm ok and when can I get water and pizza?

But you are right. It's not as if someone who legitimatly is managing it, generally speaking decided one day: you know what'd be fantastic? feal unusually moody, have a fucking awful time getting the get up and go to do much anything! People generally don't just decide to do that. It's not a weakness of a charector to want to manage this demon that will sap you of all perspective. Arguably it's a strength. Because as a society we put a lot of energy into pretending that never happens, everyone has a burn'n churn job they hate, are note, and house note and can somehow manage all that without snaping....except we can't really. 

The problem isn't going to be the person, or friend, or family struggling to espress..""well..fuck I mean how do...it's all fucked! you have two shit burger sandwiches and asked to choose between the two, my job fucking sucks because Bob can't tell ass form is head, and my time(or pay, or hours just slashed!)"" it's my experience that's often a first sign of depression.

The media does a equally bad dis-service with minimizing it as a on going issue to call the national crisis line. As if that's going to fucking help someone that's uncredibly shaky and unsettled.  We only have a half assed lipsevice chat when someone snaps, in an other way by going postal. 

That's not helping anything! that was some asshole that went postal. Then it's Oh brain and mental health issues are all caused by video games! yeah we have to blame video games, because some asshole sold a 10 year old a rocket launcher and didn't stop to ask themselves: does a 10 year old need something to clear out zombies or shot down drones over your turf at a military base,? no they're fixing to blow up their school, and grats you made it so they can turn Vanquished into CS:Go into the next target for a media rant.

TLDR: Denuva is utter shit. The average FPS drop during play, and (also) during actual play while subtle does add up.

That is potentially worth a lot because if they have it right on GoG and as you hinted at Steam because of Proton. Basically they gain: theft management, and oh shit my hyard drive exploded. No worries baked in, all that at basically no extra cost for time, coding, or hardware use?-

I instinctively could tell anti-tamper games felt slower. I didn't know they actually were! LOL asking  some dudes computer, and your own if you're not a theif 30million times a second? oO  I don't think they trash my computer and internet enough. We need to make that a lot more! lol. 

LoL I typed that...then realized EA might think that's a real challenge. lol"

TLDR: A huge fucking headache to even code. It's utter shit so target. and causes a fuck load of headaches do to it being utter shit, and causes lag in game (it scrambles all the parts the game needs to find arround . This basically means anny attempt to make a cache of stuff that doesn't change won't help reduce a fuckload of hard drive thrashing for one thing. It netoriusly causes all sorts of issues fixing bugs from developers held be EA that has a hard on for the shit. Battle Eye is somewhat better.  Steam as (sort of) built piracy management. is a fuckload faster mostly because it's not as utter, complete and total shit. It's still janky ass gheto shit.  Just not as  uterly shit as EA's bullshit that is basically fundimentally fucked, it tries to make you validate your game through some utterly ludicrus online connection shit.

Activision and EA are the biggest assholes pushing it. It basically spams the shit out of your ram and trashes the hard drive when..this thing I call a internet outage, slow internet (hello 2020, that's generally fucked) happens. EA tends to go well...it's not our faults'n stuff!!

And it's like: hmm. sure is a good though we can't just use Steam, if they just want to make sure someone isn't cheating their's 99 trillion ways to do that without being a dick to legit owners. Offline mode, a Warden or Warden esk system that esentually randomly checks if something someone is doing is cheating, and as you implied is that game legit enough to play with others (for example) I'd imagine a co-development agrement with Blizzard so as they put it something [battle.net](https://battle.net) and warden-esk would be problematic (to be nice) or muchless delicately: a clusterfuck of trust and ego.

If only we already had a low impact DRM, or  if only we knew a store that has sold millions of game coppies, and owners keep the game forever why could call one GoG the other Steam ...but that'd be just crazy."

Bust out your smart phone ma man! 

Here are some guys to try out:

Simulation: might not be a game I'll  toss it out their BitGym: Simulution. Just going around some really cool places: iOS and Android 

FitForBattle: I have no idea if this has a stationary bike mode. I thought I saw it. iOS.

Zombies. Run: Not my thing. Popular anyway: run the fuck away from zombies.

Stuff that helps gameify working out, over something lightly complex as a typical wii or switch games. Those are fun. Just take to much thinking will getting a work out on.

Strava: this is a huuuge strech. Super Buggy. And sucks a fat one for getting set up for indoor biking. I'm only putting this on the list because it's got potential. Has leaderboards, and you can readily challenge yourself.  I haven't used it in 6 months. I hope it's better because of the potential. But fucking buggy!. Android For sure.  iOS maybe- check to see.

For Switch: Shit Ring Fit for the switch. A hole other thing. Not what you asked about. Adding this in their for you to take look because I've read really good things about it. and it looks fucking fun! lol.

Not games. At all: fun, humorous pod cadcasts, or music. I lean twards upbeat, happy,  dance music. But goes with concentrating.

Back to games!

If that's the case, that might be part of the issues. I haven't had particular variety this year. I did try it last year. I mostly recall it being unable decide what to do. 

I do suggest not doing toss and wash, just in general. For one thing root is rediculusly expensive! the other thing is just really hard on your system.

IF you do decide to give it a second or third chance at least put closer to 3 maaaybe 4tbs for 2-3 cups of water in a blender then strain. Try a small amount see if you even like it.

I found it'd start I guess kind up energizing. Definatly mood lifting. for what ever that's worth. It will change from that if you have more than some as yet to be found amount. Kind of a floaty mellow sleepy thing. My crack science teem is on it to determine how that works. lol

With my current head space. Personally been enjoying Somoan, Tongan, and Hawian varieties more than Fijians.. Wait...I am wrong, totally completely, and  partially somewhat wrong lol.  Cactus Kava's Loa Lawena. The one time I had it this year. \*ok sign\* was just right.

Drink enough cola to power a rocket ship. And just enough coffee to vibrate like PikaChu. Loa'n Like you need to Waka outa that relationship

This year having the cups closer to medium sized. Or small even... I don' know how far apart specifically. It's a feel thing, and also depends a lot on the species or blends. 

For example WakaCon lawena(whitebag) has a particular kind of kick that if I don't space it out. I'll feel fucking gross. On the other extreme is Ono From Cactus Kava, or KWK Samoan. Are frankly much nicer  and gentler for me at the moment. So I can get away with having them a bit closer. That still depends on the size of the cups.

Now, a really weird thing: The two times I have Nambawan (instant) this year. had cups much more on the large side. I  didn't time how close I had 3 but pretty close.  Was...pleasent leaning without slipping in a review. Did this weird thing of feeling as if my brain was in a blender, then settled down to be pleasently, chill.

Ubuntu,fpxjjsr,t3_gg3f0a,1588983804.0,Grats!
Kava,fpxfjgm,t3_gfks49,1588981719.0,that's a lot of root!
gamesuggestions,fpxeip1,t1_fpwnytq,1588981130.0,I tried Saints Row 4th last year. I don't know. Just didn't quite click for me.
depressed,fpxecy6,t3_gfyxdj,1588981038.0,"Well. It's cheesy, it's corny, and everyone hates reading or hearing this. You're not alone! Man this entire year has been super rough! I myself have had a long list of problems, just since march alone. 2018-2019 were also rough for me spefically because got depressed, I got suicidal, and comited myself to a Bin/HealthWard. 

Covid's stuff might be helping you're issues. And that sucks!  Ask your parrents about getting help to."
gamesuggestions,fpxdtu3,t1_fpsy3ab,1588980732.0,THANKS! That did hit the spot. Do you know of other games in a somewhat simillar veign?
linux_gaming,fpxam31,t1_fpw7uh4,1588978896.0,"Dude for what...2fucking percent of the market. 5% down hill with a tail wind? they already are becoming more and more twitchy about Winodws. much less a cluster fuck of what distro, directory structor, how do I get the UI to just work, and adding in your kind of hostility at them doesn't help ma man,  QT is eh. like I said in long ass thread about Ubuntu got a small bump this for about 4 months this year...what's the hook? lets be honest with ourselves here. They MIGHT say sure why not  to to getting it to work with Web and or OpenGL. Why? mobile. It's stupid. Sure but that's a pretty solid hook only because you have a whole of people with ipads and android pads.

Have you read how people are giving Square the middle finger over the shit the pulled with FF7's remake? right and that was for steam to get it to windows. Remember people basically saying Eff, and You to DICE because of their degerate wanabe steam clone the Orgin store, over Starwars Battle Front 2017.

Unforunatly having them get shit to work natively on  Ubuntu for Linux...Rare but a Portal of problems."
linux_gaming,fpx9dx9,t3_gftog3,1588978206.0,"ok so my very unpopular opinion is to say fuck platforum specific targeting. I'd legitmately like to know: Do any company, have a legit reason to not also transpile durring their planning phase for something that can  use an any OS? LLVM is a popular example. Streaming via Steam, or through MS's Xbox games for Windows thing they have and or HAD going for example.  I keep using Unity as example of this: For fuck sake Square: really? FF7's 20 some odd fucking HUGE remake ONLY for PS4? So not only were you pretentous assholes. But for some reason decided: I know what'd be a great idea! lets cut out the hype train from Winodws and Xbox as well...because...reasons? 

&#x200B;

To quote the rock: that kind of Monkey ass Shit is on the top 10 issues. I am no fanboy of WebGL and LLV transpiling. Alas it's their, the code is shit. But it gets out thedoor somehow. That'd be one means to have bad ass hook for developers. 

It's basically the same or similar issue that this thread is beating around the bush about. Shit that's locked to a specific set of hardware hooks, OS shit, fucking sucks and was the bane of the 90's why it came back sometime in the 2k's I have idea.

Targeting Proton might help as well. As that gets it to steam, from steam onto MacOS, and Windows, and through some rubgoldbergy means onto Linux."
linux_gaming,fpx7hfw,t1_fpvvojp,1588977145.0,Eh Well Fish has a lot other issues.
linux_gaming,fpx74bq,t1_fpwrgqn,1588976942.0,">outside of some niche professional programs.

Photoshop says hello. Not Niche. Just that it is even odds if it will even launch. Gimp simply is not as well polished. Somethings are simply easier to do with Photoshop over gimp. On top of it's weird lay out."
Kava,fpx4aze,t1_fpw2q35,1588975393.0,"Yes some of the people from KavaForums and the stuff they do for making Kava. Like doing that....  . lol look I'm not all here at times. But: French Presing coffe...AND LEANING ON THE PRESS then asking why you broke a Mr.Cofee Maker......I hope that stuff is a troll...but then  look up old threads of arguments...nope they probably did. Why? No idea.  lol didn't  Kapm' Krunk post some anecdote of having to much MeloMelo at once? Something about made his cups to strong, cross eyed and swearing at the ceiling. Or was that someone else? 

LOl well my list of: why did do that agains? do include: first taking some med to help with my back being inflamed after a work out. Go out to Charol, have had at least 1 probably 2 pretty large bottles of Mead, plus...I have no idea how many cups of spiced with wine wossail. the Kava I had earlier kick in.  LOL yes the night did end about as badly as probably think by now.    I only recall hitting on one of the local bike gangs women...she was flattered...he was pissed! I have no idea how, I got home. I think I got a ride. 

Just say the wine+Kava found a toilet...and I had larengidous as well as a migraiin in the morning. I had fun! But still have that on my list of: never. doing that again. EVER."
Kava,fpx2jtj,t3_gfw9gz,1588974456.0,OP: why did you punch yourself in the dick? why not use a blender? OO
Kava,fpx1mho,t1_fpv59zb,1588973956.0,"MMM! Between Pouni Ono, and WakaCon's white bag. This year preferring Pouni Ono! 

Kavafied's Tongan is from Eua' someplace. It's really gentle, and even tastes ok For Kava.  I hope you enjoy! they sent me a email about now offering free shipping on 1 pound orders. If your funds permit. You might want to check that out!"
Kava,fpx12cu,t1_fpw5yaj,1588973655.0,"Thanks. I got lost. >\_< . I can say I have had a few terrible experiences. And Kava was involved, and even the culprit. VanuWaka giving a migrane from hell.   Nanngol Nobel BKH  even at very low seeming 2 modest strength week sups starting amazing...then yuking and cross eyed.  

 This is also why I use just a small cup. Think 4-5 ounce sippy coffe cup small. For some reason last year I was all about a effin' huge cup. This year? just not my thing.  

So. I get liking to use a  blender . I think WakaCona Lawena White bag works the best with that. At least at the moment.  IF OP had one of those. Why not use that and a simple strainer? Or the freezerbag trick, with a rolling pin and also  strain?

I don't think I have ever wanted use a fragile glass anything with Kava. Much less to punch myself in the dick.  

I have never said to my self: Self. You know what you need to do right now? Punch yourself in the dick?  And then get online with a long story saying: I decided to punch myself in the dick!"
Ubuntu,fpwva0x,t1_fpur8on,1588970614.0,"lol no arguments from me either one.  I can't find what ever University of Washington's science talk by people that know way more than I on these topics. I did find a short article from CERN.  [https://angelsanddemons.web.cern.ch/faq/antimatter-to-create-energy.html](https://angelsanddemons.web.cern.ch/faq/antimatter-to-create-energy.html) 

TLDR: The buckets needed to catch anti- matter are a little better.  Issue is making or finding enough to do more than power a light bulb.   And it also turns out to be really exepnsive to make per a not even a mole (spelling) worth. 100billion plus to make. 

LOL now that this has gone full geek. As far as I know we have yet to get as far as that with fusion.  As I say (FWIW)- I, fully, agree - It  might be amazing for Fusion to be a thing.

 It was also meant just to be a humorous quip. You do know that as well right?"
Kava,fpuraaz,t3_gfkdbd,1588921070.0,"Right on!

I am someone has had it before, just FWIW . Sometimes worth search kavaforums as well FWIW, alas may need to also double check sellers general chat area FWIW.

lol and also FWIW! I have had the tongan a few times!  Oddly not  yet this year. That might change!  The last time I had it: Gentle and lighter.  What I mean is for example: PouniOno from KWK tends to brighten my day. But not be in a really hard kind of way compared to some Wakacoons WhiteBag . That may not make sense if you haven't had those. 

All that said. The last time I had Tonga shit last summer I think it was, oO.... At I thing about 4-5 TBS of root per 2 cups of water: it was cozy, easing, light-not  super energizing like WakaCon's Lawena.  

It's a pop summer cozy kind...alas I find it slowed me down a bit to much for driving (for example)  

But as I say since I haven't had it this year that might be a bit different."
