dementia,fqfbphk,t1_fq53kr5,1589322074.0,Thanks for sharing your experience. Sounds like him yet I think there is more to it. I think he is also Bipolar or Borderline. I read your comment several times because it is all relevant to my situation. Just wish he could let go. The unquiet in his head disturbs me greatly. I have been through all my own psychological stuff and come through it as a pretty laid back person mostly. Don't like being around people for any length of time though. Avoid alcohol dissociate with a game or book. I wish this for him because leaving would create even more problems for the foreseable future.
COVID19positive,fqbirii,t3_ghnvcg,1589237752.0,I knew this would be the case. Russian media is Putin's mouth. In our countries the media is run by money for advertising so we get garbage anyway. Sensational crap for the average moron to eat up and sell cars and whatever else to them during the breaks. Both systems are bad. Sometimes we cannot stop nature and we are trying to do this stupid thing by causing everyone to lose there jobs and maybe starve or commit suicide instead. The virus will go away by itself and if it doesn't it's gods will. If a worse virus or problem comes along after this we have wasted all our reserves and we will truly be even more phuked.

The pain was that tear your insides out suffering. The next day she blocked his death out completely. He says that he understands but doesn't seem to by his actions.

I believe it's because her memory is so bad that she confabulates to make sense of it. So yeah, it's a confabulation, not a hallucination.
