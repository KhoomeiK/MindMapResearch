depression,fqzna0m,t3_glszfc,1589770973.0,"You should know that your current state of mind is shared by lots of others during this lockdown. The daily content on this subreddit alone proves it. Getting up is difficult when it feels like there’s nothing substantial to do, so you have to create something substantial to do. Try something new or outside of your usual schedule. Maybe you could do something you’ve been meaning to do. Working outside helps me. If you have close friends, family, or an S.O., reach out to them. They may feel the same way, and that means they could sympathize with you."
depression,fqvh7nh,t3_gl5uur,1589677199.0,"I also struggle to answer this. For now, here’s my answer: Use medication if you pose a serious threat to yourself. I’m not a fucking medical professional, though, so take this however you please. I just think that if you already planned your suicide, and you’re just waiting for the moment to follow-through, you should consider using medication to preserve your life. I really try to stay away from medication. That’s simply my preference. I know people who use it, though. I’m pretty sure it ruined my one friend’s life, but he started young and used a hefty quantity of medication. On the other hand, I know others who use it and plan to quit. They haven’t yet."
depression,fqvg6qi,t3_gl1vmv,1589676585.0,"I understand your point. There are people who want to help, but a lot of people on this subreddit deal with their own thing. They can’t or simply don’t want to help/meddle with other people’s things."
depression,fqvfou4,t3_ghdi7l,1589676289.0,"I think depression is prevalent, though. In fact, I’d say suffering from at least a bout of it is common. Even if they aren’t depressed, their future circumstances may result in depression. They likely don’t perceive their surroundings as a “hellhole”. Maybe they don’t spend too much time critically analyzing themselves and the world."
Feminism,fovq9r0,t1_fou7v1x,1588105665.0,"My dude. I understand, but like...he's an accused rapist. Look outside of party lines and try to break ideology and discern your blind spots. Voting isn't just about deciding what's convenient for you, it's about the future of our country, society, women. We need to set a precedence here."
lonely,fokc9cr,t3_g7xrwv,1587839378.0,"I don't think putting on a mask is entirely worth it. This is coming from the daughter of a mom who has two kids besides me. I'm off to college next semester, and my mom and I are finally beginning to *really* talk. For a long time, I found it very difficult to trust that my mom understands me. It wasn't her fault, however. I suffered a few years with an eating disorder. More recently, I battled suicidal thoughts. I realize now how painful it must have been for her to deal with my emotional struggles. At first, when she'd reveal how tired she was, I got angry. I knew how hard she works at her job (she's in tech) and at home, but I rejected seeing my mom as anything other than that--a mom. Eventually, I matured and learned through the personal conversations we held. Today, I'm trying to pay her back for the years of rejection and anger on my part. I think if she'd kept a mask on through my whole childhood, we wouldn't have connected. Hope this helps."

EDAnonymous,fm9pjcs,t3_fi2tx5,1585873679.0,"Actually...I like your kind of attitude. All of the internal struggles I’ve encountered were worthy of lots of very difficult work (on my part) to recover. 
Moreover, even when I was bulimic, I loathed thinspo and proana content. It baffled me that people promoted each-other’s unhealthy relationship with food."

Being in my own bubble for long enough just becomes painful, though, because I start wondering if I'll find anyone with a similar mindset."
math,flw8z8t,t3_frf4ua,1585542972.0,"I used to dislike math, as well! In elementary and middle school, math classes often left me discouraged and/or disinterested. Now I am pursuing a degree in Physics. 

My interests shifted rather dramatically over time. I grew fascinated by math after transferring to independent learning in high school. It tied into my burgeoning curiosity regarding space science. I attended an eccentric, individualistic school. Given the freedom to customize projects that linked math and our world, I discovered the real weight of mathematics **for myself**. I started to see math as a vastly complex code for the universe. 

The grounding nature of mathematics motivates me to discover and learn. The internet is pretty useful for these purposes (everybody loves some James Grime). I also installed a whiteboard in my room to write on. I enjoy writing proofs, working problems, and mulling over concepts on the board to cure boredom and explore in my spare time."
