Dr. Levetino an ex abortionist turned prolife had great videos demonstrating how he preformed abortions, how the tools are used, and the different methods used depending on gestation period.

This really is not an argument thats up for debate. All the 2020 candidates running (except for I think Amy klobuchar) support abortion up to point of birth. It‚Äôs something estimated to be around 1-2% of all abortion, but the simple fact that it exists at all is disturbing

The simple fact that democrats just blocked a bill that would protect babies ‚Äúborn alive‚Äù is evidence that they believe abortion up to the point of birth is totally ok.

Abortion in the 2nd or 3rd trimester Is not to save lives. In one of the rare cases that abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother is an ectopic pregnancy.
