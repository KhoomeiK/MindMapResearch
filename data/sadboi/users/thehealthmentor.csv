The thing for them to go away is to transmit to the guilty thoughts the message that you don’t care that they’re there, and you’re not going to do anything about them. Don't seek resolution, relief, nothing… Then guilt goes down, you interrupt cycle and cravings weaken tremendously."
EatingDisorders,fj0x0op,t3_faeawe,1582909139.0,"Guilt means you cannot accept yourself at this moment. It’s all only because if your thoughts about what has happened. The mind thinks compulsively to find some explanation, relief, escape, hope… This will get you nowhere because all that tension becomes your triggers, the less acceptance you have, the more triggers and cravings you’ll get. Whatever relief you get by thinking compulsively, will backfire against you later.

So if you are guilty, you need to stay as you are, don’t seek to resolve anything. Stay with the fact. Those are just emotions, every emotion is temporary, if you’re unaware, they renew themselves. If you felt nothing about whatever, you would not have a problem. So it seems that you’re a binge eater, you love X type of high-calorie food, you never have enough… Those are all feeling that come about the way I told you. Through a lack of acceptance and living in compulsive thought processes, you cannot see how it fluctuates. If you saw it, you will no longer fear binge eating.

Every emotion that comes out, it goes out, so don’t give it attention through overthinking. If you do that you lose awareness, thus they persist. Let those emotions go out."

Let's look at the nature of guilt and how so we can deactivate it.

When you feel guilt, what is it about? Why are you guilty?"
BingeEatingDisorder,fiwvwkh,t3_f9yrqv,1582805172.0,"When you feel guilty depressed or anxious, is more because you want to get to relief usually with thought. Be aware of that. Then if you can stop trying to get relief from your thoughts, you will feel better. 

Every emotion that comes out, it goes out, but if we get lost in our thoughts, it continues being there and going to the surface. This is so of every unconscious thought."
BingeEatingDisorder,fiwvcmg,t3_f9z6fg,1582804570.0,"Delete that account and start fresh. Every time you look at things that remind you of your old self you recreate those emotions. Let go, and create a photo of a graph where you lose all the weight, and look at it every day in a relaxed manner. 

That way you use what has been building what you don't want to build what you do want."
EatingDisorders,fiwugrb,t3_faa2ke,1582803550.0,"Eating disorders have more to do with not accepting your body and feeling bad about your appearance. And those elements are both males and females.

Don't be hard on yourself, if you can keep up a week, that is wonderful. You just need to accept yourself more, that tension comes from non-acceptance.

Start by setting a goal you're 100% sure you can accomplish. Maybe cut down in a half the sweets you eat after 7 days.

Also, do some self-acceptance affirmations during the week. When you feel more acceptance there's nothing to worry about, because you already accept. This brings the energy back, that was previously lost resisting, and give you the ability to choose.

I hope this helps you :)"
BingeEatingDisorder,fin322j,t3_f8fwkb,1582554553.0,"Your mind is very fixated on the issue. I recommend you to find why you want to lose weight. And focus your mind in that direction often. Affirmations, visualization, journaling, are techniques that work because it's just about putting your mind there.

The trick is to let go of negative emotions that may come up. They may come for different reasons, fear, impatience... Just don't talk to those voices.

In time your mind will adapt. And you will feel more empowered because of your focus, and the intensity of the cravings will go down. The cravings are only there because of the negative emotions prior to them."

BingeEatingDisorder,fimsrpm,t3_f8n1w8,1582545574.0,"OCD and binge eating disorder can be related. Because of the compulsive following of thoughts about food and guilt.

As thoughts of food, guilt, or low self-acceptance, worth, etc... appear, there's like an obsession to resolve it. This is the OCD part.

You need to ignore those voices because they're just physiological arousal. If you don't engage in them, your state will come back to normal. It's always an illusion that you can relieve yourself by thinking more."
BingeEatingDisorder,fih3910,t3_f7h8sq,1582406043.0,"It seems that you're very concerned about the issue. 

It's ok that you want to change it. But if you keep your awareness on where you are you'll stay there. And what keeps it there? Guilt and lack of self-acceptance.

I recommend you to consciously get aware when you have guilty thoughts, aware of your senses and aware of your thoughts, knowing that they're there. Do that habitually, your goal to stay aware until there's nothing.

And focus more on your what you want to get by stopping binge eating. You need a purpose, you can't just stop. Because your awareness will focus on what you are now. When you have the purpose the awareness will move there more automatically.

Another technique is to get into a meditative state, focus on your breath with the eyes closed, and repeatedly think about what you want. This makes those thoughts influence you with more strength more automatically."

Based on it's conditioning, we lose our peace of mind and come up with compulsive needs. The voice finds ways to make you seek something, making you feel discomfort in moment.

Instead of following that conditioning, which never gets satisfied, delete it.

BingeEatingDisorder,f40rxjv,t1_f1r9xrx,1571306352.0,"The post may look like it advocates dieting. But it teaches how to not experience the negative emotions that you usually experience by dieting.

It also teaches that the key to this is to release all attachment, and all control, and to never diet willingly.

Also, the context that it refers to as dieting is, the pattern of eating for the fulfillment of a weight goal, pattern that occurs intuitively, by desire and not by resistance, and this pattern is formed once one is able to feel the goals he desires healthwise. Because of all human behavior, all impulses are caused by emotions, and your patterns of thinking that create emotions, your patterns of thinking come from the environment, and your brain is constantly programming itself by seeing what is there around you and forming your desires, intentions, even your taste which is subjective, etc... Then there's also your experience and how you process everything around you, your judgments, your associations, evaluations, and by releasing all care, all awareness about the problem by tackling it at the level of the subconscious, and by asking the questions I placed below in the post, you can clear those. 

The change in ideas in your consciousness will lead to a change in all impulses, all desires, all that one considers pleasurable.

The problem you have is that you have associated diet with deprivation so much that you cannot even distinguish the act from your associations, you don't realize that you have a problem with feeling bad, not with dieting, but if your mind those concepts are totally connected. as my post says:

""If something is good or bad it’s because of how it makes us feel and all of our emotions are generated from these unconscious evaluations, comparisons, judgments, presuppositions or evaluations, and you can start to take control of what you perceive and [*create your own experience.*](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/your-perception-is-your-reality.html)*""*

I hope you understand it."
BingeEatingDisorder,f40p9sz,t1_f1qblwt,1571304280.0,"Again, this post tells you that as you begin to become more aware of ideas of health, you will make healthy choices automatically, as you have a goal, you will desire to eat what will accomplish that goal more, and desire what will not accomplish it less.

You have not understood my point at all...

also here's the definition of spam.

spam/spam/

1. 1.irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent over the Internet, typically to a large number of users, for the purposes of advertising, phishing, spreading malware, etc.

Also, all spam messages are eliminated, this hasn't because it's relevant, provides help, and it doesn't sell.

The misunderstanding you've made about my post have influence you negatively against me as I see."
BingeEatingDisorder,f40omdo,t1_f1q3kd5,1571303766.0,"I doesn't advocate dieting, it tells that as you let go of fixating your focus into where you are now and then focus on an inspiring goal for your health, then you will begin to make good healthy choices intuitively and willingly, and that you should never force yourself to change, that you must reprogram yourself the same way you have been program to have what you have now, to intentionally create the health you want.

It also tells you that taste is subjective, and the ideas that make it into your mind tweak what you desire to do or not and teach you how to take advantage of this idea to begin to feel pulled toward what you want. 

The issue is that when you think of a very fit body, for example, you feel pain because that is processed through the lenses of where you are now, but you can let go of that, understand how you got to where you are now, using the same system to become who you want, and as you understand that you stop forcing control over yourself, but instead focusing on what is programming you, and you change very quickly, it's eliminating the problem from the cause of it, instead of the effect.

If you think sharing this lifechanging free information is spam, then you're doing a disservice to all the people in this sub. Also, I have struggled many years with bad habits, and I've lost 30lbs+ and lasted for 6 years as well as having read hundreds of books on psychology If all ""spam"" was like this the world will be a wonderful place."
BingeEatingDisorder,f40nfq5,t1_f1q12m3,1571302825.0,"The real issue is thinking about those bodies from the point of reference of your experience, meaning you think about having that body and then you remember all the times you fail and feel very negative, then fail again. But as the post shows you can let go of those thoughts and emotions so you stop feeling bad about yourself.

If you want to lose weight you must think about a body goal that really inspires you, because it's our emotions that drives behavior, if you don't there will be no emotional drive to make that happen.

This post is all about helping you stop worrying about your body, and stop trying to control, and it tells that the method for change it's when you're suggestible, or by changing your environment, and going baby steps, and it teaches that anxiety is the indicator that you are going too hard, and it will backfire. 

This is what really heals binge eating, stopping to give too much importance to your body, and stopping to be attached to it, and as we've been programmed to binge by our environment, we can consciously reprogram ourselves to have better habits, without having to fight, the current situation, or being attached to the goal, because that further reprograms ourselves to keep having unhealthy habits."

BingeEatingDisorder,ezz5ptj,t3_d30m4p,1568281046.0,"Release your need to control yourself, all behavior comes from emotions, what you feel you do, if you try to resist or have excessive control, you're focused on the problem, and feeling it, which causes you to keep it in mind more and repeat it even more. Instead, accept the situation and yourself, when you do this you're telling your mind, there's no need to get emotionally involved in this or think about this anymore, so it goes away, and here's when the magic happens, then you have to know what you want specifically (body, lifestyle, habits, experiences), and keep it in your mind, as well as all around you (pictures, quotes, reminders, inspiration). Then you will start to feel those things, and when that happens cravings go away, and desire to choose healthy foods, and take the steps to take it, will go through the roof, after that it's all a matter of keeping the goal and the details in mind.

If you will feel worst about yourself and your present situation, means that you still haven't accepted yourself, so you must really let go of that control that you have of yourself, and all the ways in which you treat yourself like a binge eater."
BingeEatingDisorder,ezz42y4,t3_d2wsmj,1568280132.0,"You must not take your thoughts as a matter of concern, or as who you are because if you do you will feel it, and as you feel it you act upon it. There's a way in which you can separate yourself from your thoughts before they affect you, just a thought doesn't have the power to affect your emotions, but if you believe is who you are or it's going to come back it will.

In reality your brain's work is that it must adapt your mindset, desires, habit... to your thoughts and intention 100% of the time, if you want to be healthy and fit, you must instantly experience desire to eat healthy, and take the steps toward that, the problem is that people end up believing that those thoughts are them, instead of a reflection of an external trigger, they think that they will not go away, or what is worst, they try to push them away which causes them to come back more. Instead, focus on what you want.

Here are some books that talk about this if you want to learn it :

Learned Optimism

Feeling Good, This one is long, read the chapters that relate to your problem.

BingeEatingDisorder,ezz1s9e,t3_d2yb7d,1568278912.0,"What has happened is that you're feeling a backfire effect. The best way to change your diet is to change it very gradually, releasing all force, and to keep the reason that inspire you in your mind constantly and all around you, and as you get relaxed (without trying to do anything, or force yourself to manage your eating), you will begin to feel compelled emotionally to make changes, make those changes as the inspiration comes (you can't live with an image in mind without it affecting your emotions thus your behaviors).

It's just release all that grip that you have to restrict yourself so that you stop feeling it, which will allow you to feel your motives and inspirations, and whatever you feel is what you do, that's the secret to lasting change to switch your patterns of thinking and feeling."

You will always react to things the same way you did the last time, If you can change how you react the next time you have a trigger, you will react the same way next time.

The best way to go about that is to become aware of your thoughts without thinking about them, let the thoughts be without thinking about the thoughts, all emotions comes from thinking about the thoughts trust me, you'll see this.

There's automatic thoughts, those don't do anything, and there's thoughts about the thoughts, where all emotions come."
