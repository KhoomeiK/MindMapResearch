raisedbynarcissists,fj95km4,t1_fj931w8,1583133080.0,It hurts a lot. Literally I just have a ton of guilt and sadness now for saying what I said but held it in for so long. Going no contact with him means I cannot have a relationship with my little brothers which also is why I‚Äôve tried to hard to play along and keep my pain to myself. Hopefully he won‚Äôt try to figure out a way into my baby‚Äôs life later on. Didn‚Äôt think about that. Still learning about this. Thank you for responding. Much love to you
raisedbynarcissists,fj95k2n,t1_fj936cd,1583133061.0,"It definitely does. I feel really guilty already and questioning myself for doing so and expressing how I feel finally. This means he will block me from having a relationship with my little brothers . Been praying he will for years that something will change. Crying. Wishing. Hoping. 

Haven‚Äôt gone no contact before and scared but hopefully there is healing somewhere in this. 

It‚Äôs okay, thank you for responding to this. It means a lot."

BPD,fhyo2nq,t3_f5fvcj,1581979974.0,"Dbt really helps me in between work shifts. I work in a restaurant and have been there a year surprisingly. This is the longest job I‚Äôve ever held without getting fired or quitting. Literally have the worst social anxiety. Working in BOH or the kitchen can help bc everyone works in there own areas like the grill or prepping veggies and fruit and usually listen to music on their own. I work in the front and I get anxiety with coworkers and paranoia but distract myself with working on the cash register, catering, or customers. They‚Äôre strangers so I just put on a happy face. A job for social anxiety and bpd that may be better would be bookkeeping, library, office, or working in a very small place like dry cleaners where you‚Äôre one of 2 people or working by yourself or something. Also googling dbt acceptance skills and a few others help!"
BPD,fhyn8sm,t3_f5gopn,1581979457.0,"It is totally understandable how you feel. My sons father and I split up when he was 3 months old. It was my choice.. my hormones were haywire. He barely looked at me or our baby. He resented me because I didn‚Äôt work because of my bpd afraid of daycare and work so he was completely drained from being the only one working and paying all of the bills. My paranoia and splitting on him wasn‚Äôt helping so I just said fuck it I‚Äôm leaving with the baby and had everything moved furniture and all before he even made it home.. My son is currently 11 months old. We‚Äôre on good terms now and coparenting very well. Been in dbt therapy for bpd since. 

Being at home alone with the baby not working would cause your mind to race maybe. Mine did and had intrusive thoughts and depression really bad. Started working at fast causal restaurant(literally the longest job I‚Äôve ever kept so far and got a promotion to a catering specialist for the company handling calls). Also just completed a medical trade program for college to work a better job at nights after work. Started in nov and done as of last week. The classes cost less than $800 broken up in payments so I could pay for therapy and daycare. I‚Äôm not saying this to boast but to be an example and tell you it‚Äôs possible! I applied through DHR because of my low income. Childcare is $50. I get food stamps and WIC bc of income as well to help pay for baby food. Hate to put my business out there but there‚Äôs always a way to get help. As a young college age girl I needed help so it‚Äôs not bad to go that route. Getting help from the government eventually runs out for all of these services. Social security, unemployment, all of it so you would need to think of something long term to help you and baby if you plan on moving out. Look into your local housing departments for the city you live in. Found apartments for single moms with disabilities or low income 2br in the high rises downtown here which are surprisingly not in a bad area and look normal. There‚Äôs just restrictions about guest and your income obviously but there‚Äôs resources everywhere. Working would make you feel more proud of yourself. Maybe you can work from home doing online sales, teaching, ect. Google some work from home jobs if you want to be home.. hope this helps!"
BPD,fhylo1o,t3_f4xgti,1581978488.0,That‚Äôs a big move! I‚Äôm sure it feels like you can breathe better! I‚Äôm proud of you!!
BPD,fhyljyv,t3_f5ej5d,1581978420.0,"Struggled with this while pregnant, but got a job at a fast casual restaurant as a cashier doing FOH work, answering calls, cleaning lightly, ect and have been there for a over a year which is the only job I‚Äôve managed to keep so far for that long. 

You could do something like that. Call center jobs, office work, library work sorting through different floors and books, working at a cell phone retailer like AT&T are laid back, insurance sales, dry cleaning is normally only one or two people in a space not strenuous, delivery driving (found to be easy as hell and makes a lot of money if you don‚Äôt mind driving. Having bpd I can run in and out of a restaurant and provide food). Definitely look online. Oh also Starbucks will help pay for college but both Starbucks and Target have GREAT health insurance benefits if you work at least 30-35hrs..

Good luck mama and congratulations!"

AskAstrologers,fhw0yz8,t1_fhujzpw,1581904317.0,"That‚Äôs amazing advice, thank you! This is not my chart at all, but what you described sounds so fitting for them to look into. They were super successful when living in Los Angeles for years career wise and then moved to a southern state in a metropolitan city that has limited growth. To be honest, their current location is very conservative (not that conservativeness is a negative thing) as well as type of work which causes road blocks sometimes for people of color/POC especially women working in engineering and architectural type work. The divide amongst types of people is obvious to everyone that lives in this city it‚Äôs just the way it is. Networking sounds like her best bet right now though. 

She‚Äôs very logical and progressive thinking. She‚Äôs pretty skeptical about Astro but what you said definitely raised eye brows and caused her to wonder now. I‚Äôm still learning a lot about astrology myself, but may pay for a full reading for her and ask about the astrocartography now that your answer sparked her interest! Thank you!!"
BPD,fhurslx,t3_f4t73g,1581889467.0,"Oh my goodness, same! It‚Äôs usually with a show, artist, and music. Like I will research everything I can as far as the actors or singer, their family life, relationship, look up the artist or actors zodiac sign, watch all interviews they‚Äôve done, listen to all the music they have or the show soundtrack and then when I‚Äôm done it‚Äôs like a crash and then something else has to appear. It‚Äôs happened with very few people I know personally trying to figure out why they stopped talking to me or find answers and then give up. 

It use to be with creating art non stop but my depression and bpd kinda overshadowed that and lost interest as much. I always have the desire in my head on new canvas ideas or projects but can‚Äôt bring myself to physically do it. Art is one thing that will always stay. Had a time where it was centered around trying different psychedelics and then that stopped quickly. Smoking weed chasing a high went on for years but it makes me paranoid now so my obsessions stay with other things. Didn‚Äôt know it was associated with bpd"

raisedbynarcissists,fhp7lno,t1_fhp66v4,1581783746.0,"You‚Äôre definitely right. I‚Äôm in my 20s everyone places a big importance on it. A platform like this has felt safe for me to engage like asking other moms baby questions as first time mom or things like this when needed. I‚Äôve been off of Facebook and Instagram since Dec 25th mainly to focus on finishing classes and focus on my baby as a single mom. I just completed my medical program for ophthalmology finally feb 4th. Baby boy is having a minor surgery soon. Literally isolated and not physically around anyone but my baby or coworkers with family and friends living in different places which has effected my mental health somewhat to not have anyone to talk to or help for awhile. It‚Äôs not a top priority to be on social media like that, I just hate that his actions are a big reason for me to avoid using it when I feel comfortable and ready to share baby milestones with others or updates and things because he makes it about him somehow and puts on a show.

BPD,fh1iohi,t3_f116bp,1581216068.0,"I‚Äôm sure it would be possible. Especially if you had documentation to show you‚Äôve been or are actively in counseling and/or on mediations which isn‚Äôt a bad thing! I‚Äôm a first time mom to a 10 month old baby boy. Wasn‚Äôt planned of course but would of hated myself and spiraled if I decided not to keep him. Didn‚Äôt think it was possible. I made a deal with myself after a few months of being a mom to start and stay in therapy and so far so good after almost 1yr. I haven‚Äôt split on him at all. Quiet borderline too. Will admit I‚Äôve split on others while being frustrated with him like when he‚Äôs cried allllll night and his dad isn‚Äôt helping or my mom trying to overstep, but dbt therapy really helps with patience overall. The only thing that is an issue sometimes is dissociation from being overwhelmed which isn‚Äôt too big of an issue. Also I‚Äôve noticed that he has some strong emotions like is sensitive to things which everyone loves to point out he gets from me. He‚Äôs my happy place because he always loves me no matter what and wants to be near by while playing or whatever even if he‚Äôs not held (enjoying it while it last lol). He‚Äôs a very happy baby and always giggling and him growing and learning things  is a great distraction from my own head. 

Anyone can make a great parent regardless of having bpd because of the level of empathy we have for others and how much we care about everything really. Counseling or mediations or both will help tremendously even couples counseling in addition to one centered around bpd. We have a childlikeness about us that makes it easier to connect on a different level. Having a child around bring awareness of ones actions so it makes you second guess an outburst. You‚Äôre way more cautious about how it‚Äôll effect them bc you have this little human with big eyes looking up to you. Everything I feel he feels (ex- crying in front of him he looks worried and sad and may cry too. Not that literal but it affects them a lot) and you can see the reaction of that outside of yourself so it helps curve splitting especially on them. Anything is possible and you have the ability to be a great parent as long as you try to heal for yourself! I‚Äôm not sure what kind of evaluations and requirements are standard but did read on google that withholding information about mental health can be used against you but they‚Äôre more likely to still allow adoption if you‚Äôre honest and keep things monitored. A general physical is required for most but did see if they have legal documentation that you‚Äôre keeping it in check with counseling and or mediation you wouldn‚Äôt be disqualified at all! Google some things. Found some info under adoption . Com 

Sorry for the long post. Good luck with your wishes üíú you‚Äôll be great."
BPD,fh1dh15,t3_f0noib,1581213785.0,"Same! It‚Äôs so hard not to absorb vibes in a room from others whether it‚Äôs sadness or anger. Happiness too. My manager has some anger issues and will do things like punch the wall in the back or mumble very angrily under his breath near by over someone‚Äôs food getting messed up or is being slammed (working at a restaurant) and I‚Äôll try so hard not to loose my shit at work because it‚Äôs a trigger to be around hostile energy that I cannot help fix or leave away from. Anytime anyone is angry near me or at me it‚Äôs like my heart starts racing, I get anxious, I either wanna retreat to chill out and if I cannot and then it‚Äôll build up from 0-100. I hate it."

Anyway, the first week I think was the hardest to get through when quitting, so I transitioned to the Juul for about 2 1/2 months. What ultimately got me to quit then was the fact that I‚Äôd lost the Juul several times and had to buy new ones which were $35 not including the cartridges at the times and was broke af and had no choice so I took it as a sign from the universe to quit hah. Found out I was pregnant shortly after so I continued to stay away.. now tasting or smelling cigarettes alone is repulsive to me idk why but it changed. I read that it takes our brain a minimum of 25 days to break a habit so I believe you can quit! The anger is really shitty but find a way to transition like even to a vape with 0 nicotine if needed.

We were about to leave to take a trip to visit my grandma who lives an hr away. I panicked and asked what time will we come back bc I had shit to do later like go to the store. She cut me off mid sentence to talk about an assumption on what she thinks I‚Äôm gonna say and wouldn‚Äôt let me talk. I try to get it out. She cuts me off and over talks me again. I get mad and walk away for a minute to chill. Came back irritated and then she ask like 10x why are you still mad I can tell. I try not to say anything about it and grab my bag signaling to leave so we can go bc it takes time to get over it. She ask again. I finally scream so loud at her and tell her cutting me off and aggressively over talking me drives me CRAZY and makes me feel dismissed and is draining trying to communicate when getting cut off every time I speak. She does it to everyone without realizing it. She‚Äôs always been the only female in a corporate office and single mom in big cities so she dominates the convo sometimes. She got her feelings hurt and I feel like absolute shit so my grandmother suggest my mom come without me another day which sucks. If she wouldn‚Äôt have cut me off I would of just simply asked ‚Äúcan we stop by the store after I have stuff to get before work‚Äù. She left me at her house so she‚Äôs not around me and said she needs a break from me for at least an hr bc it‚Äôs too much. Called her to apologize as hard as it is that soon after a fight and we ended up yelling again. Idk why are like this with our moms but it‚Äôs fucking exhausting dude."

bonnaroo,feoxu4e,t3_eq3sly,1579307735.0,Literally me at least once a day at work. Through talking about it I discovered half of my coworkers are going again this year.
occult,feoxg8b,t1_fef244y,1579307493.0,Thank you so much for this! I wish we could speak privately about the discussion. You helped more than you‚Äôll ever know just by this response.
occult,feey4zc,t1_feeuk79,1579043772.0,"Ah, I see.  That‚Äôs deep."
occult,feexcdn,t1_fe94nvv,1579043262.0,"That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm more curious about. Thank you for sharing that. What books have more info on demons? I‚Äôm not fond of working with the left hand path myself(been studying African centered occultism for several years), but have friends who work with some on their own path and they don‚Äôt share much. I‚Äôve personally have been trying to figure out how to banish one that I have not knowingly called to me. Trying to learn more about them to have a stronger sense of how to banish it for good."
occult,feetsua,t1_fe69enj,1579041055.0,Thank you for your response. Very interesting. When you say ‚Äúthe book‚Äù are you referring to The Key of Solomon‚Äô ?
occult,fe5y3ct,t3_ens3jv,1578877514.0,"Beautiful altar cloth! Excuse my ignorance, I‚Äôm not on that path/side, but why would one want to summon a demon or demons? Not being judgmental but curious."
occult,fdkqey8,t3_elqapq,1578508992.0,All is mental. Don‚Äôt feed the idea of it. It cannot affect someone who is vibrating higher than the dense energy used to create it if you truly feel that way. If it gets serious try a banishing ritual
