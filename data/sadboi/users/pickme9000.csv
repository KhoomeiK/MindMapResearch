BPD,fmgwf4v,t1_fmgrhqc,1586059665.0,"To be fair on him, it happened 5 years ago and I treated both of them extremely badly during that time. He doesn’t think pursuing another person while in a relationship is worth doing to anyone anymore. And if a situation like that ever happened to me again I wouldn’t go through it again for a million bucks."
BPD,fmglo33,t3_fv4req,1586051778.0,I force myself to sleep when I get unhealthy urges like self harm or crying. Even a relaxing bath could help too. Try not to listen to any triggering music try to fake good vibes the best you can. Good luck I hope you can get through this. <3
BPD,fmgl7vx,t3_fuu57l,1586051502.0,"God I remember when my two best friends, one finally got a cell phone and one finally got a computer. The one with a cell phone literally has not texted me in 5 years, except once to tell me she had sex with my cousin. :) and the one with a pc, games with anyone and everyone but me. 

Lovely really."

BPD,flk4crm,t1_flj0brw,1585233659.0,"She didn’t get the difference between a best friend and a fp. She didn’t think she was truly my best friend if I didn’t consider her my fp, which makes perfect sense from someone without a bpd POV but for me it’s like, I trusted her, I loved her, I didn’t split on her, I had healthy distance, I had very positive thoughts about her and our friendship. That made her the best friend I could ask for."

BPD,fijydcv,t3_f7suvc,1582467931.0,Damn it’s like I was reading my own thoughts. The last paragraph is sadly so true. :/
BPD,fh9u3yz,t1_fh9stcz,1581389644.0,I’m sorry someone came at you like that. Some people here can be really cruel and I don’t get it either.
BPD,fh9sr0i,t3_f217lt,1581388751.0,I feel this! My bf stopped being my fp years ago but I feel like we became a lot more stable since. Things are still great and exciting I just don’t revolve around him and it’s refreshing. Having no fp feels consistently better than having a fp.
BPD,fh9segu,t1_fh9r0la,1581388524.0,"Well the people running the sub are generally nice and helpful in my experience. There’s lurkers without bpd here. There’s also people with bpd who are a bit preachy/act like they are cured and come at rant posts really condescending. 

I’ve had a similar reaction when I came to rant and got attacked and told to suck it up and that family problems aren’t really that bad. But the reality is that was one bitter person and there’s a bigger amount of people here who don’t like seeing others going through bpd struggles.

I don’t want to seem rude, I see where you’re coming from but also it’s nice to get a POV from someone else."
