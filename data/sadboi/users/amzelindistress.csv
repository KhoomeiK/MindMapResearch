But as others have said here, please be careful! It's not that we're trying to discourage you or look down on the situation but there's nothing wrong with taking some extra cautionary measures. I truly hope you have a good time, though, and everything works out for the best. <3 Please keep us informed!"

AskVet,f011wh1,t1_f00z7hj,1568309438.0,"I just talked to Vet #3 again and she won't listen to me. She's insisting that he was never vaccinated against FIV even though I remember him being vaccinated against it and Vet #1, who we just talked to today, says he was tested for it (negative) and then given vaccinations afterwards but Vet #3 insists that there is no vaccination for it so he wouldn't have received one even though this was back in 2016 when the vaccination was still on the market. She got really snotty about it too like we don't know what we're talking about. 

Thank you for the information! You've been super helpful. I'm definitely going to talk to Vet #2 tomorrow too (they're closed today) and see what they say/suggest."

Yes, I am positive. I double checked with Vet #1 about it and he *was* vaccinated for FIV in 2016 but vet #3, after knowing he was vaccinated against it, is adamant that he has FIV after receiving a positive test for it. 

So, he's unlikely to have FIV then, right? Since he was vaccinated against it in 2016..."

You're amazing and I hope you have a wonderful week. <3"
depression,erg6ehj,t1_erfsck3,1560827817.0,"Depression does not discriminate based on age or anything, really. Anyone can suffer from it. She's 13, fine, but that doesn't invalidate her feelings or problems. ""Calm down"" is not an okay response to say to someone who is struggling whether they're 13 or 60. Don't be an ass."
depression,erg64jv,t3_c1on9e,1560827573.0,"You and your situation remind me a lot of my cousin and what she is going through. She's 13 also and her mother, a woman who is diagnosed with depression/bipolar disorder herself, doubts her daughter's depression because she's ""too young"" to be depressed. I do what I can to help her but her mom is super controlling and I have to pretty much walk on eggshells around her. 

I can also somewhat relate to what you're going through. I'm currently 29 years old and I've been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was 12. So I get it. I do. Something that has helped me tremendously is finding people to talk to and I'm not talking about therapy. I have a few very close friends, although they're all online friends. My best friend has helped me in more ways than anyone else. I've another friend who is going through a very similar situation as me and I consider her my twin flame because of that and it's nice to have someone like that to relate to so you don't feel so alone. I think if you could at least find one person to talk to about your feelings, it would help. Even if that person is just someone you meet online.

At the end of the day, anyone can suffer from depression. Doesn't matter your age, your religion, your background, how rich or poor you are, how skinny or fat, how attractive or average or unattractive, anyone can suffer from depression and people need to realize this."

AskReddit,eqno99j,t3_bynja2,1560178249.0,"When I was in elementary school, my best friend at the time came from a poorer family and she had seven siblings, so she had a lot of hand-me-down clothes and such so she was always getting picked on for that. I was getting picked on because I was shy and quiet and an easy target. We both also dealt with weight problems, so that added fuel to the bullies fire. 

A boy who frequently picked on us was throwing rocks at my best friend who was playing on the swings. I wasn't one to really defend myself because of how shy and submissive I was but seeing him throw rocks at my best friend really set me off. So I kicked him between the legs. 

Of course, I was the one who got in trouble. 

The same boy ended up giving me a fat lip a long time after that occurrence. When I went home with it, my mom was furious. She went to the school and talked to the teacher about it, the one who supervised recess. She told my mom that she needed to tell me to just ignore him and play on the other side of the playground. 

My mom then went to the principal and talked to him. The principal did nothing. The boy continued to bully me and my friend.

My mom then proceeded to go to school with me and confronted the bully on the playground in front of everyone and yelled at him and told him that if he didn't leave us alone, she would personally make him. 

Bully was nice to me and my friend after that.

Unrelated to my story but when my mom told me when she was in school, a girl would often pick on her and harass her by pulling her hair and other stuff. My mom took it for a while. But then she didn't. One time in gym class when the girl was sitting behind my mom, pulling her hair, my mom turned around and started beating the crap out of her. The girl then wanted to be my mom's best friend."

depression,eqkvxit,t3_byq2fq,1560132269.0,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with being sensitive! You do not need to be fixed. Most likely, you are an empath. You feel so deeply with your body, mind, soul, and heart. It can suck sometimes, only because of how much you hurt when others hurt, but you know what? You're a good person. Don't ever think you need to be fixed or helped because you care about people or animals or even insects. Honestly, I'm like this too. I know it isn't societally acceptable for a man to be so emotional but fuck that. I think it makes you even more of a man. Or will make you more of a man. Please never let anyone make you feel weird or different or ashamed. This is who you are. Embrace it. The world needs more people like us."

We've been with them since 2001 so I feel your pain. I've started referring to them as CenturyStink. Unfortunately, they're the only ISP in my area save for Sattelite internet. Not sure if it's because they have a monopoly on the area or what. Is there a way to find out? We've lived in two different places and both places only offered CenturyStink and Hughes Net/Viasat or whatever they're called. I long for fiber internet or cable but alas, I get stuck with shitty DSL with a 10 mpbs download speed and a below 1 mpbs upload speed. Ugh."

I can touch his ears without causing him too much pain but hes still got a head tilt and is off balance a bit and when he wakes up or moves a certain way, you can definitely tell he is still having pain. Hes still lethargic and sleeping a lot too but his appetite is top notch. 

I'm glad you havent heard of any fatalities when it comes to ear infections. That eases my mind a little."
