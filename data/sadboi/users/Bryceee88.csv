leafs,ffcaisp,t1_ffc1qae,1579795241.0,He just came off something like a 7 game multi point streak in the Q. He is carrying that team on his back. He's unreal.
leafs,fempxcc,t1_femap8f,1579266116.0,Rask is worth 7m and it runs until he's 34. That's not bad. Paying Freddy upwards of 7m+ when he will be turning 32 at the very beginning of the contract is a bad idea.

leafs,fajl62t,t1_fajcg59,1576143433.0,He was traded to them a couple years ago and he wasn't even given a chance. He was just a contract to bring back and that didn't sit with him well obviously..

bookhaul,f0migrc,t1_f0mi3og,1568745725.0,Apparently his publisher wouldn’t release the unabridged version because it was too expensive so they edited out a couple hundred pages. That’s why he went back later and released the unabridged version. I don’t know why they wouldn’t even if it was expensive because like you said he was already famous at that point.
bookhaul,f0mhp1d,t1_f0mfj80,1568745219.0,I saw him say that he didn’t like the edited version because the editor messed with the overall story in a way he didn’t appreciate or something like that but he also said that the unabridged was too much at times. I don’t remember what he said exactly but it was something along those lines.

My mom called the police and they didn’t believe we were telling the whole story for whatever reason and told us there was nothing they could do. My friend had a longboard with him.
