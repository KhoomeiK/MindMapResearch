Anxiety,fi59wt6,t3_f6jyv0,1582158239.0,I'm going through a lot of the same things right now. Got off my Effexor and my anxiety came back with a vengeance. A lot of completely sleepless nights while continuing to go to work tired. Which made the anxiety worse. Today is day 6 back on my meds and feel a bit better. Sleeping some but not all night. Feel free to talk to me. I could use it myself. When you say text do you mean on Reddit? Or do you want my number?
