Ninjas weren’t a culture in itself or an ethnicity, but mercenaries in Japan from around 15th-17th centuries. In the US there were no ninjas, they weren’t an oppressed group of people here, ninjas became popular in pop culture after it became popular in Japan.

It’s different if the historical context is based on oppression.

Since I come from a country that doesn’t celebrate Halloween, my opinion on Halloween costumes is biased (find the modern celebration of it a waste since it has nothing to do with it’s original roots), but you have to be honest, wearing something from another culture or just dressing up as a stereotype is pretty lazy and unoriginal.

Second of all, you have the right to refuse to sex if you're not feeling it and he should have some compassion since you are busy and stressed. Most men don't understand that you can't force yourself to be in the mood just like that.

 Wanted to ask, is his schedule just a busy as yours or does he have more free time? Maybe he has a difficulty seeing your side of this, maybe the busy part of your studies needs to pass. Also should track of other mood changes you have because taking the pill has different side effects for people, maybe it's all together.

I'd suggest looking at your relationship and evaluate - what's on your relationship besides the sex, are you both happy with each other over all?

Maybe let her be distant for a little while, if nothing changes, should try to reach out to her and talk about this and how it's affecting you and the relationship. A simple ""I hope you're doing better and that having some space helped, but I would really appreciate it if you'd just tell me you need some time to process things or deal with stress, rather than brushing me off"". 

She should be able to understand that a relationship is a two way street and that she needs to take your feelings into consideration. Perhaps she had a really bad day or breakdown which is causing her to act like this and needs time to mentally recharge herself. Hope everything works out."
relationship_advice,f055h9r,t3_d3tsq6,1568402772.0,"Like most comments here say, you should be direct and tell her that you love her, but feel like you need more time in the relationship to consider that. Each person has a different tempo, for me, I could never get engaged after only one year of dating, seems like rushing. But if that's what she wants, then she has the right to feel that way and should receive an honest answer from you. If she really wants to settle with you, she should be just as forward-coming and wait."
relationship_advice,f054ph8,t3_d3tsx1,1568402382.0,"I honestly think that if you two really do love each other, you will be able to sort this out. No relationship will be 100%, you both will always have to make decisions and compromise on some issues. 

But what is important is that you both entered the relationship with the thought of not having kids, so you can't hold anything against him by sticking to his opinion. Since your opinion changed, it is possible his opinion might change too. Maybe your relationship still needs to grow, for such a decision?"

It seems like they are taking advantage of you and just using you as a person to do other people's dirty work or pick up their slack. I understand that they don't want a newbie to handle everything, but how else are you going to get that experience? If your supervisors say nothing then better find a place that will appreciate your effort."

Those, who hire illegal immigrants should be jailed, not the exploited people, who are being used.

There are special businesses that deal with getting them across, since the legal process in the US is too long and complicated. I'm sure all these people would be willing to properly integrate into society as legal citizens, if they had the proper chance."
unpopularopinion,ezqet7v,t3_d1t0va,1568058308.0,"I agree with body acceptance that you shouldn't feel subhuman for being different or being constantly bullied 24/7 for having extra weight. Most fat people know they're fat, they don't need rude comments every day, since that only deters them from changing themselves, but feeds their bad habits.

But all these people are deluding themselves by telling themselves and others that they are perfect the way they are. Weight can be changed for almost every overweight person."

insaneparents,ezkxxcn,t1_ezkxkag,1567968438.0,This is the dark side of that app that worries me. Pretty sure the app can be easily hacked or a kidnapper can just break the phone anyways or leave it in a bus or something to throw the police off
insaneparents,ezkvi6t,t1_ezkuznd,1567967252.0,"Your example seems like the perfect model of how in the right hands it can be helpful. As long as there is healthy communication between children and their parents, it can be like an extra layer of protection because bad things can happen to anyone at any time."

Back when I was your age smartphones were still beginning to be a thing so luckily didn't have to deal with such apps. My mom's rule was to have my phone on so she could contact me whenever."
insaneparents,ezkreo7,t1_ezkqpz6,1567965286.0,"I would always tell my mom I'll be home around a certain time on these days because of after-school activities, but she would still send texts around 9pm, asking where I am, because she never listens and finds it easier to ask again and again, really frustrated me when I used to live with her until I was 19."
insaneparents,ezkr4rh,t1_ezkpo6j,1567965156.0,"These kinds of apps to me seem like a really lazy and controlling way of parenting, instead of teaching your kid about mutual trust and how important it is to communicate to make sure the kid is ok (especially preschoolers), it's easier to just monitor them and punish them for overstepping boundaries without explanation."
insaneparents,ezkqcp0,t1_ezkofir,1567964772.0,"That's really unnerving, it seems really hard for some parents balance their protectiveness and trust. For my mom it was important that I just have my phone on so she could call me."
