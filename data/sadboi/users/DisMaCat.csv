I minimized talking at length. Voices are harder to distinguish as male and female if you don't have extended discussion. Let say, you're calling a position in a game, or you see someone in an fps. I would typically just default to ""target, description of location"" and minimize any social discussion. If someone outted my as a female, and the comments started, I would focus more on the game and pretty much cease talking. Responding to the taunting doesn't typically make it stop. It isn't a good solution, but it can help reduce the ""GRIL??"""

While this is wonderful, and provides warmth and light for those who we help, we often find ourselves using the remainder to fill in our own cracks when we can.

Art,fm2a1q9,t1_fm28bz4,1585693382.0,"Wow! What a thoughtful reply. I appreciate the feedback. This piece took me about 50 hours, I’d guess. I wanted to post a full album, but have not. 

The back is painted and has lights as well, but much less. The 4 inch hole I cut to insert the lights is capped with a piece of plastic from from the plumbing area of a diy store, so that is raised in the back slightly to allow repairs if necessary. The back is less about being visible and more just keeping cohesion and not being blank. The piece is meant to be in a corner or against a wall without the back on display.

The mannequin is a full body with the exception of the head. The legs are fixed. The arms articulate at the shoulder and can be posed somewhat, this leads to some paint wear that I’ve touched up. You will be less impressed by my skills when I reveal the arms can be completely removed! 

I have a ton of progress photos that I can share another time or privately, there are so many layers of paint that aren’t visible but have created an awesome crackling texture. 

The piece is meant to be tactile and touchable, I think it invites that and as such it has like 10 layers of semigloss sealant on it. All of the lights are exactly the same size but some have halos to make them appear larger or smaller. 

I think I answered everything but feel free to ask more or reach out!"
