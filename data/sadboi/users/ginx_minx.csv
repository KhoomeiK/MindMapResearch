I suddenly stopped all contact with everyone and felt pretty bad about never giving an explanation but at that point I was too long into it. Sometimes people go through shit and do weird things.

We eventually became closer again when she sent me a card about how much she missed me and did not understand and wanted to be close again. This reassured me a lot, seeing she did not hate me for what I did. I told her I felt too much pressure in meeting up but was there for her 'online' which she appreciated.

I don't only feel bad for the people I go with, but also for myself. Usually the things I end up canceling due to this are things I would have loved to go to the day before.

Going over boundaries I did not want to cross which made me uncomfortable or just plain doing things I did not want to do nor like. Only in therapy I discovered other people have flaws as well and I started seeing those in people. This made me accept my flaws too and for example not feel guilty about saying no to things my friends really wanted to do. It's not selfish to put yourself first, it's pretty healthy actually.

The application is just the products I described and putting them all over my hair. Not too much just enough so you feel you've got your whole hair. 

Brushing I do with my hands in the shower after the moisturizer.

I wash my hair 1 time a week, with Goldwell Dual senses Hydrating shampoo. Then I wash it with Aphogee Balancing Moisturizer and let this sit in for 2 minutes before rinsing it out. Also I detangle my hair afterwards with my hands.

For styling I start with Mixed Chicks Leave-In conditioner and put this all throughout my hair. Then I take a tiny bit of Aveda Damage Remedy and also put this throughout my hair with my hands. The last thing I put in is Mixed Chicks styling gel. I focus a bit more on my ends and try not to put too much in the roots. Then I scrunch the whole bunch and use my diffuser to air dry my hair.

Every 6 weeks I also use the Aphogee two-step protein treatment. I also use Olaplex number 3 every few weeks and the Aphogee Keratin 2 minute reconstructor as well. I also try to put a SheaMoisture mask in it every week that is moisturizing, I do switch these up a lot"
