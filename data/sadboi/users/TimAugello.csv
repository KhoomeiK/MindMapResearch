All I'm saying is don't let others effect you like that. I'm not gonna talk on suicide, I don't really want to live either so me trying to talk someone out of it is hypocritical, but if you let other people drive you to that... they shouldn't have that power.

Breaking up was best for us both but I've never felt more similar to someone in my life, she understood me better than anyone. It's a struggle to manage, understand, and properly express those emotions especially when drunk but I'm often trying to do so in drunk texts to her & friends & I figured sharing my feelings here was a better alternative to alienating people w/drunk texts."

It feels like the end of the world a bit b/c to some extent it is quite literally killing off a life, a version of you in how you were with her, and that's not easy. Hopefully it gets better.

Screenwriting,fgsu671,t1_fgsswlf,1581092727.0,"One last thing, and this is the most important lesson I learned: treat each day like it's your last. Develop a routine and do the same work daily, maybe change what you do in said block but keep that block generally the same type of work or topic. Shouldn't even be written out eventually, should be natural. But if you're focusing on yourself & your work for a year, you need that day by day progress you need consistency & you need some variety within the confines of said consistency. It's a balancing act."
Screenwriting,fgstvhi,t1_fgsswlf,1581092550.0,"Sorry if that sounded harsh, I've been there. I know friends that've been there. None of these people liked the experience & personally I feel like it took a lot from me. I know some of this may sound dumb but I'm speaking from years of my life wasted so just hear me out. 

We're programmed to be social, we will mentally starve w/o human contact so always make it a priority. Also, you need stability & a clear plan w/short term & long term goals to stay motivated. And always make a point of staying out of bed no matter what, it makes all the difference in the world mentally to just stand up & grab some water. Little things like masterbating also hinder motivation & as a 20-something male who spends his time at home that's not easy but save it for the night time. Finally, I'd recommend at least a part time job even if it's 20 hours otherwise it'll look bad on a resume (like it seriously hurt mine) & you'll start to go crazy having no urgency to do something, no requirement but your own. 

It's an incredibly alluring idea, esp. to the dreamer artists, but it can be more of a burden than not a burden. Although it did teach me a lot about myself and if you feel in your gut you need that, it's just something that needs to happen for better or for worse."
