StarWars,fp57bya,t3_gbdcay,1588318826.0,"The way the clones attacked Ashoka was so strategic. I know it’s obvious and we’ve seen it before with other Jedi, but it’s so interesting to remember that the clones know exactly how to kill the Jedi, given how long they’ve fought with them. Ashoka wouldn’t have lasted much longer had she not had an escape route. 

Also props to the build up in this episode. The first half was so eerie given we knew what was about to happen. My heart couldn’t stop beating so fast."

There’s so many themes about being a hero even without a quirk, I wouldn’t be surprised if Deku sacrifices everything He’s learned for the sake of saving someone. (Perhaps Eri reverts him back to his quirkless state?)"

I mean, just look at how wholesome that direct was. At least we’re guaranteed that every new fighter that comes out will have had time and hard work put into it."

I know that animation studios are on a budget and not every fight can be visually amazing, but I just feel like my boy Mirio got robbed of his moment a bit because all we saw were slideshows and stills."
