InlineHockey,fqc01p8,t3_ghpdqo,1589247337.0,"Bearings are kind of a trick in my opinion. You can spend over 100 bucks on bearings and really the improvement you get in performance is negligible. After normal wear from the skate hitting the ground and dirt getting in, the extra cost just isn’t worth it. Reds bearings which tends to be one of the most popular skateboarding brands don’t even really advertise Abec rating because it kind of doesn’t matter when you’re not using your bearings on precision machinery. We’re skating on them and bearings get ruined eventually.

In terms of wheels you’ll want to find something harder so they don’t wear down too quickly. Pay attention to if your skates are all the same size or if you need to run hi-low set up for example I need 76mm in front and 80 in back. I aim to be harder than 80a for outdoor"
InlineHockey,fo7pju2,t1_fo72myg,1587582334.0,Don’t go based on wheels or bearings. Both are very replaceable and will never last the lifetime of the boot. If you order from inline warehouse they allow returns. Take advantage of that and try the fit. If you don’t like it try the next one.

I noticed when I’m turning My skates usually lean a little inward. When I’m turning my skates don’t both lean the same way and thus my body isn’t leaning in that direction. Seems spooky to not have my body directly over my skates
longboarding,flmh1t1,t3_fpk0d7,1585283434.0,Your speed is good. If you get a little lower before you initiate the slide you'll naturally lean back a little more. Getting lower also make it easier if you do fall because falling from 3 feet is easier than falling from 4 feet high. looks good man. Dedicate to it and make it happen

I never thought that the accusation is that Rorschacks ideals lead to the 7k. More so that small things here and there get misinterpreted and an extremist will use it to justify their own views as they see fit. 

Let's look at modern American politics. Memes have actually become a large part in communicating ideas to people in quick digestable images. The""feels bad man"" frog doesn't have a political leaning at its source. But because of 4chan and Facebook propagandists, the frog has taken on a new meaning and is viewed by some to be inherently racist. The Rorscach mask isn't inherently racist but in this alternate timeline the mask has taken on new meaning."

Something to keep in mind is that most champs won't 100 to 0 an enemy. The strategy is to pick your fights and poke the enemy's health down. Once you get it a little lower then an ability power based champ can use all of their abilities to get the kill. We call this burst. Annie, in this example has really good range on her auto attack. It might seem small to only hit 1 auto attack every once in a while but those hits add up. When you think you can win a fight go in for the burst!"
