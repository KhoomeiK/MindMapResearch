reactivedogs,fr5vi8t,t1_fr5anlv,1589915356.0,Thank you! It’s made a HUGE difference in my mood when it comes to training.
reactivedogs,fr5qa7u,t1_fr5i6xr,1589912851.0,Oh yeah definitely every dog is different. I think some people may think that because it doesn’t work for all dogs that it’s not effective but every dog responds differently to things so it may work for some and not others.
reactivedogs,fr58nle,t1_fr55umu,1589904428.0,It’s definitely been a game changer for us too which is why I was so surprised to see so many opposed to it. I think the problem mostly is that people think it’s a solution that will totally fix the problem when really it just helps make things more manageable. The leash tension would almost make him more worked up and was definitely a distraction. Without that distraction he’s listening to me much more. I’ve even started to see him improve his decision making. I’ll see him think about starting to pull forward or see him perk up a little when he sees a bird or hears something interesting but he’ll immediately stop and look to me instead which he was entirely unable to do before.
reactivedogs,fr588g8,t1_fr55woe,1589904215.0,"Definitely. I have a collie mix and whatever he’s mixed with made him an absolute tank, he’s so strong! That in combination with his determination to pull anywhere he wants made it almost impossible for me to redirect him without almost hurting him. Even when we see a trigger like a dog from a distance that may be slightly over his threshold I’m much more able to easily redirect him without so much as a small tug and a “let’s go.”"
reactivedogs,fr4rce0,t3_gmeebb,1589895315.0,"What really helped me is journaling! I keep a google sheet spreadsheet with some basic info like did he eat all of his dinner and how often did he poop to keep track of his health but I also have a column for progress and setbacks and a column where I rank the day overall (either with a smiley face or a frown face). Everyday I make sure I fill out both columns, even on the days where it seems like there was nothing but setbacks I still force myself to find a progress or positive point. This has helped me SO much and it can really put things into perspective for you and making yourself look for the positives even on the bad days could help you realize that the day went better than you expected. After a while you can look back and see how far your dog has come because sometimes as owners we’re just too close to the situation to really see how much progress we’ve actually made."
Dogtraining,fr2alrg,t3_gm0t16,1589833994.0,"Not sure if anyone suggested it yet and this is definitely not an entire solution but my pup loves to chew but basically only on stuffed toys unless the hard toys are flavored or have foo in them but he’s on a diet so I can’t do that too often. I get him the toys specifically made for tough chewers and they don’t last forever but they last WAY longer than regular toys. I could give him a regular stuffed toy and it would be completely torn apart and de-stuffed in about an hour. I got him a stuffed monkey about two weeks ago made for tough chewers and it’s taken some damage for sure (he already got the squeaker out and that’s his main mission with all his toys lol) but it’s pretty much still intact. We play tug with it and he’ll pull on a leg and I’ll pull an arm and luckily for the monkey it still has all its limbs. Definitely check out getting stuffed toys made for tough chewers, there aren’t as many widely available as regular stuffed toys but at least they last longer and won’t make a lot of noise on your floor!"
mentalhealth,fqxc9gw,t3_glf7jj,1589729785.0,"Very true. I did dance for just under 10 years, was taking multiple classes a week and some on the weekends. I loved it. I wanted to be a professional dancer one day. At the start of my freshman year of high school when the new dance season started, which would have been my 10th, I just remember one day waking up and suddenly I wasn’t excited to go to dance anymore. Of course there were always some days where I didn’t want to because I was tired but this was different. When I thought about dance I didn’t get the same feeling I did before. I remember crying to my dad in the car and saying I didn’t want to anymore. I couldn’t understand why. I was so upset to give it up, reaching the 10 year milestone in my studio was a big deal, they gave you a special shoutout during the recitals and everything. I couldn’t wait for the day I was a senior in high school and I got to do the special dance with the other high school seniors to honor them as we “graduated” from the studio. And then one day I just... didn’t care anymore. Looking back I know now it was because I was in the height of my depression. I became severely depressed in 8th grade, although I had signs of depression and anxiety for much much longer. I still miss it a lot and one day I hope to take some adult classes once a week just to do it again but I’ll never get back to the level I was before and that makes me so sad because I worked so hard to get to that point. Losing interest in a hobby is normal but if you suddenly lose interest in a hobby that you really love and you can’t explain why, don’t be afraid to seek some help and counseling to help you work through it."
Dogtraining,fqvybhr,t3_gl75id,1589687988.0,That’s the day we all dream of! Absolutely amazing job to both of you on all your hard work
Dogtraining,fqtamuk,t3_gkos7q,1589634738.0,"First would be like everyone else says, keep him on a leash until you are more than confident he will come when called. When you’re walking him and you see a person or dog walking towards you and he gets excited and starts pulling and getting worked up, immediately turn around without hesitation and walk back the way you came until he’s calm again. Once he’s calm turn back around and keep walking. If he gets excited again, repeat this process. If you continue walking towards them or they keep walking towards you, your dog’s behavior is rewarded since to him the reward is that he gets to go say hi. Turning around and walking away from his reward until he’s calm will eventually teach him that he can only go up to meet people or dogs when he is calm. 

I’ve also seen people suggest to get him good at walking on a leash in a low stimuli area and I definitely agree. Build that trust and relationship on a leash and you’ll have an easier time getting him to listen to you. Slowly increase the stimuli by going to different areas and working on your dog’s training. If you’re concerned about pulling I highly recommend trying a no pull harness or gentle leader. My dog pulled like CRAZY. I tried to use chicken to motivate him to stay next to me but as soon as he got the chicken he would go back to pulling. I got him a gentle leader, which is a collar that also goes around his snout and is a similar concept to the leads used on horses. The first walk I took him on with the gentle leader was a complete 180. It’s still taking him time to get used to the feeling of having something on his face and he still occasionally tries to pull if he sees something he REALLY wants to sniff but otherwise the walks are going great. The reason why no pulling is important is because A. Pulling can cause physical injury to your dog no matter if you’re using a traditional flat collar or harness and B. A tense leash can actually be a distraction for a dog and for a reactive dog, a tense leash can add fuel to the fire and get them more worked up. I’ve noticed in my walks since using the gentle leader that my dog is much more easily able to refocus on me when he gets distracted which has made a big difference in our communication. 

If you want you can get a vest online that says “in training do not approach/touch/no dogs or people” you can find them on Etsy for a reasonable price and there are different ones for all kinds of needs. It may not FULLY stop people from approaching your dog while trying to train him but generally when people see a brightly colored vest on a dog that says in training do not approach, they get the idea."

dogs,fqoe4zr,t1_fqo9qiy,1589513207.0,"That’s a technique used by trainers frequently, especially for dogs that are aggressive when guests enter the home. It allows the stranger to show they aren’t a threat while also keeping a safe distance. This is particularly effective in cases for dogs that have a low threshold. When you are keeping in mind the dog’s threshold, they are in a state that is more comfortable and easy for them to focus and do what is asked of them. Giving treats and praising this behavior helps reinforce that seeing a person and remaining calm is good and creates that positive association. I really just suggested that if some people wanted they could keep some extra treats on hand and now you’re making assumptions about the way I train my dog and why he even behaves this way int he first place which is exactly why I posted this in the first place because so many people assume."
dogs,fqodigu,t1_fqo9isa,1589512809.0,"That’s because training can be stressful, overwhelming, and exhausting. I haven’t tried every single thing, I have tried a lot but these things take time, not every method is going to work overnight, some might not even fully work in a week or a month depending on the dog. It’s working out just fine thank you, he’s currently sleeping in his orthopedic bed, belly up after a long play session."
dogs,fqo9kc7,t1_fqo9d1z,1589510398.0,I said that when you see a reactive dog keep distance between you and them. That’s it. Damn I really need to stop forgetting how much people like to misinterpret what you say on the internet

dogs,fqo869v,t1_fqo5ipg,1589509559.0,"In this instance the dogs came around a corner suddenly, I had no time to prepare. Had I seen them from a farther distance within his threshold I would have had time to distance us farther and gain his focus but unfortunately in this situation I didn’t have that opportunity which happens sometimes. Sometimes with a reactive dog things happen suddenly (mostly people and dogs turning a corner) and you have little time to prepare and in that case the best you can do is try to limit just how much your dog is freaking out and get back to a comfortable distance."
dogs,fqo7ukv,t1_fqo4yb1,1589509365.0,"I’m sorry but I can’t help but laugh at this. You think that because my dog is easily distracted and hyperactive I’m not able to train him and I should give him up? Training a reactive dog and getting them to respond to you and chose to ignore what interests them takes time, weeks and months in some cases, especially when that dog is VERY motivated by its triggers and has had little to no training previously."
dogs,fqnp617,t1_fqnmjiq,1589498895.0,Thanks! Some people weren’t too happy about what I said but I think it’s something that gets little awareness and definitely needs a lot more
dogs,fqnirib,t3_gjpqpx,1589495587.0,"If you don’t judge then this post wasn’t directed towards you. I just think there’s a big misunderstanding and stigma around reactive dogs and I think everyone would benefit from knowing more about it, even people with the most well behaved dogs."
dogs,fqnidsm,t1_fqnh979,1589495394.0,"They popped around a corner! Unfortunately it was impossible for me to prepare myself as soon as they came around the corner my dog started reacting. Regardless I’m not going to explain my situation anymore because it seems like people are misinterpreting, it could be my fault maybe I’m not explaining it well enough. Anyway some people just genuinely don’t know what to do around reactive dogs so I thought I would provide some information so they do know for their safety! Similar to how you would teach a child to properly interact with any dog. It’s just important for people to know."

Tossing treats at a dog is often used as a training method to create positive associations with strangers, it obviously won’t work for all dogs and certain dogs have dietary needs that mean they cannot eat certain treats but like I said it’s just one idea of many for anyone who wants to help or doesn’t want to upset a reactive dog but doesn’t know how. It’s always important to ask an owner first if you can give a dog a treat, that’s not even a question."
dogs,fqnbf8a,t1_fqn491r,1589491889.0,It was just a tip! I obviously don’t expect anyone to do anything but if anyone was interested in helping or understanding what to do in that type of situation I wanted to provide that information.
dogs,fqmjx2c,t1_fqmja1h,1589478665.0,"Or maybe you should, unless you’re seeing something different than me I never said they couldn’t walk. Some people just don’t understand that distance is important for reactive dogs. Just expressing my frustration that they didn’t know which isn’t necessarily to blame them. If you don’t like or can’t understand what I had to say then just please move on. This post was meant to draw more awareness and have a discussion about the struggles of those with reactive dogs have and to give tips to others on how they can help so that the situation is less stressful to every person and dog involved."
dogs,fqmjecr,t1_fqmg18t,1589478420.0,"Exactly, some people really just don’t know the importance of distance with reactive dogs which is why I wanted to post this. Distance is better for every dog and person involved. It’s nice that they want to help of course but still."

dogs,fqmizzm,t1_fqmgml1,1589478232.0,"I never said that. Obviously they can go wherever they want. Had they been closer I would have said “my dog is fearful of other dogs I’m going to put some distance between us before you continue if you don’t mind” I couldn’t do that so they kept walking, which is obviously their right, but that was just something that I had to deal with. Just putting it out there that some people aren’t really aware of what to do around reactive dogs, I don’t think it’s super unreasonable to ask that if someone sees a reactive dog they keep their distance for the safety and well being of everyone involved."
dogs,fqmf6yb,t1_fqmdvt3,1589476441.0,"Right?! It’s not a show! This post was inspired by this morning when we went to the park. It’s a fairly big park that not many people go too, usually just enough to where he’s still within his threshold and he did great the last time we were there, even with people walking by. Today, not so much. There were two unleashed dogs, fortunately they were far away, and people walking along the sidewalk. We found a secluded little corner and hooked him up to his 50 foot leash to play some fetch but he was already in hyperdrive as I like to call it. Too much stimulation, too much going on. I tried to get him to play anyway to see if I could redirect his attention and tire him out. It was going okay, I was feeling overwhelmed but it was manageable. Then this guy comes along walking right towards us, definitely too close for comfort, because there was a dirt pathway to exit the park where we were standing (even though it’s the very corner of the park). I was using all my strength to keep my dog back as he walked passed us, and he just looks at me and gives me this look like “really lady? Get control of your dog.” Right after that we just left because my dog was waaayyy over threshold (and so was I tbh). I’m not going to ask someone to go entirely out of their way for my dog but damn he didn’t have to look at me like that lol it made me so mad/sad."

On our walk yesterday we saw them from far away and my dog was barking and lunging while the other two were totally unbothered. The owner was too far away for me to call to her and ask her to wait so I could get more distance so she kept walking towards us as she clearly saw my dog freaking out. It got to the point where all I could do to get him away was to pick him up! That’s why I wanted to put this post out there so more people would realize that just because their dog is well behaved, that doesn’t necessarily give them the right to do whatever that triggers another dog."

My boyfriend and I tried to leave to go to the grocery store together but he started barking within like 20 seconds of us leaving (we recorded him so I looked back at the footage). I live in an apartment so leaving him barking while we went wasn’t an option so my boyfriend just went back in and I went to the store. Since then we leave for less than 20 seconds (we do the whole routine, put shoes on, coat on, grab the keys etc) and come back in before he starts barking (take off shoes and coat, hang up keys) so he knows no bark=people come home and he gets used to being alone and we plan on trying to increase the time little by little. We haven’t tried this yet but I heard having a social toy that they only get when you leave helps, especially if it’s something like a kong where it keeps them busy. I’ve heard most dogs get pretty tired out after finishing their kong so afterwards they either play for a little or sleep. My dog doesn’t really have much of an interest in his kong and he’s only really food motivated about boiled chicken so I plan on getting a slow feeder bowl and sprinkling some shredded chicken in there, filling it a little with some unsalted chicken broth, and then freezing it so he has to lick at it for a while to get the chicken but he also gets the taste of the chicken broth and the slow feeder makes him really have to work for it.

I’m so thankful too because he has separation anxiety, as most adopted dogs do, and because I have no where to go I can take the time to desensitize him to being alone for longer and longer amounts of time rather than having to jump right in and leave him home alone and hope for the best."

dogs,fq5r7t7,t3_gguvpy,1589115216.0,"Dogs don’t understand the word no. They don’t know what it means. All they hear is a sound. Saying no, or even worse yelling no, won’t do anything, especially for a puppy who is still learning. If you want a command for them to not do something, teach them “leave it.”  
Turning your dog on it’s side, aka the “alpha roll,” is widely debated but generally evidence suggests that this does nothing and in fact could worsen the problem and lead to an insecure dog and having an insecure dog leads to reactivity and destructive behavior. Not only that but this behavior is rarely observed in wolves (where the dominance theory stems from). It is more common for a wolf to WILLINGLY roll over into a passive position to show they aren’t a threat. We also know that dogs, although they share a common ancestor with wolves, dogs today are different from them in a lot of ways, therefore trying to use a “wolf pack” mentality is ineffective. In doing this, you aren’t creating a confident dog and you aren’t creating a bond for them to trust you which is the foundation of a well behaved dog who is easy to train. Work to teach your dog right from wrong, not make it so fearful of you it acts out of fear, aka self preservation because when you force a dog into a vulnerable belly up position and pin them down, their instincts make them have every reason to believe you’re trying to harm them. Empower your dog not to bite by teaching it what is and isn’t okay to bite during play or any other time (aka toys=yes people/other dogs=no). Having a dog who knows right from wrong through positive reinforcement rather than fear creates a confident dog who knows that they can trust you which leads to the well behaved, well trained dog we all want. If the puppy bites, immediately stop play and ignore them completely, no petting, no talking, no eye contact, literally pretend they don’t exist. Even if the pup continues to bite, continue to ignore until it stopes. . As soon as the puppy settles down again, resume play. This shows that biting is bad because it ends play, being calm and behaved is good because we get to play. They’ll get the idea pretty quickly but also understand doing it a few times isn’t going to be enough. You have to be consistent and you have to be patient. Point is, forcing your dog into submission isn’t going to teach them anything but to be fearful and could more than likely make the problem worse and less to even worse behavior problems in the future. I’m not a dog trainer or a professional by any means however, there is plenty of academic and scientifically studied papers by dog behaviorists that point to positive reinforcement being the most effective and there are thousands of highly qualified and highly experienced dog trainers and behaviorists who say the same."

Going into the semester I was so excited to write my thesis and my professor was so supportive of my topic which was a topic that I’m really passionate about. My goal was to win the department award for best thesis and at the start I really worked hard towards it. After all the shit hit the fan my motivation fell down the toilet and I just couldn’t get myself to put in the work anymore. My thesis turned out okay, but it was NOTHING like I had imagined it. I envisioned my presentation for months and it went nothing like I had hoped, even over zoom. I only had 15 or less minutes to present on a complex in depth topic that should’ve had at least 30 minutes dedicated to it. I’m heartbroken that after years of hard work and excitement for when I got to write my thesis it came down to this, especially because it’s a topic that is so important to me and that I’m so passionate about.

dogs,fps36f6,t3_gezzq3,1588866692.0,"I feel like some people think you’re accusing them of being a bad owner when you ask them to leash their dog when in reality is for the safety of everyone involved. Someone I follow on Instagram was ranting that she was walking on a trail with her dog off leash and her dog approached a woman and a dog on leash and the woman kicked her dog away (not sure if she meant she just used her leg to keep the dog away or if she actually kicked him) and how she was angry because her dog is a “good dog.” As someone with a leash reactive dog unleashed dogs are my WORST fear and personally I would rather gently kick a dog away than have it end up in a fight. I kindly explained this to her and she still didn’t understand because again, her dog is a “good dog.” It’s unfortunate that there’s such a negative connotation with asking to leash a dog, I don’t know why you wouldn’t want to. If someone told me to leash my dog because their dog is fearful or aggressive I would in an instant not only for my dog but for the sake of the other dog who is stressed out.

doggos,fpozk7t,t1_fpozbs6,1588793362.0,They look very similar! Prince’s ears stand up a little more but they had very similar coloring.
dogs,fpohr9u,t3_gekq0q,1588784710.0,"We passed TWO moving cars coming up the drive to our apartment complex and Prince sat and watched me the whole time. At the end of the walk there was one car that he lunged at but that’s on me because I wasn’t quick enough to have him sit and watch me. Even still, he only lunged once whereas just a couple days ago he was lunging and barking like crazy!"
reactivedogs,fpk2efi,t1_fpk1n3g,1588686602.0,"I’m so glad you’ve had success on it! I’m actually taking him to the vet tomorrow anyway so hopefully all goes well and they’ll agree. It’s not even just about me, he doesn’t deserve to live so fearfully the time I can’t imagine how terrible that must be for him."
reactivedogs,fpjzqi1,t3_gdqvnh,1588684975.0,"If your pup is anxious a Cesar Millan style training *could* make them worse. The goal of positive reinforcement is to ensure the anxiety doesn’t worsen and therefore make the behavior worse. Talk to your vet as well, they could have some trainers and behaviorists they can recommend to you."
reactivedogs,fpjzhec,t3_gdr0pm,1588684812.0,"Have you talked to your vet about possible medication? It could be that Duke is just a naturally anxious dog to the point where regular training just isn’t enough. Some medication could help bring his anxiety levels down to a more manageable point to make it easier on you and on him. I’m considering talking to my vet about medication for my dog for that same reason. Great dog, but he’s so anxious that when something triggers him there’s no getting his attention back until we’re far away from the trigger. Good luck my friend!"
reactivedogs,fpjyuti,t3_gdp59n,1588684416.0,"I’m hoping to be able to talk to my vet about getting Prince on some kind of medication. He responds well to boiled chicken as treats but if there’s something that triggers him, all the chicken in the world couldn’t get him to be distracted. His threshold for other dogs is almost 0, the other day he wasn’t able to finally sit and watch me until they were completely out view. I just feel like he needs something to “take the edge off” so that he can get to a point where, at the very least, he’s reactive but I can redirect his attention."
rescuedogs,fpjy5y5,t1_fpjm17r,1588683956.0,Thank you I definitely will!
rescuedogs,fpiocyt,t3_gdkfm5,1588645142.0,"I commend you so much for your patience! Congrats, can’t wait for the day my Prince can walk past other dogs, people, or moving cars. You give me hope!"
Dogtraining,fpgyqcv,t1_fpgx5fv,1588611890.0,"I personally haven’t heard of CBD being a trigger, omg act I’ve heard many positive stories of people using CBD to help them stop marijuana! But that’s a decision you’ll have to make yourself of course. One other thing that helps me a TON is I have a spreadsheet tracker that I use and each day I put down how much he ate in the morning, in the evening, when he poops (mostly just to make sure he’s on a regular schedule for health reasons), and I also put down progress we’ve made and setbacks we’ve had and I rate the day over all (smiley face or frown face). It’s so easy to get overwhelmed by the bad stuff but keeping track forces you to find the good stuff too and you can look back after a few weeks or months and see how far you’ve come!"
Dogtraining,fpghub5,t1_fpg8vtv,1588603002.0,I have anxiety too and I use CBD oil to help me relax before I walk him. I also just have to remind myself that I’m doing the very best I can. It’s definitely a great way to work on mindfulness.
Dogtraining,fpesako,t1_fperwy0,1588553870.0,"I feel that for sure. My boyfriend has been SUCH a big help to me, it’s so easy to lose sight from one setback he helps me refocus. I almost have to mediate before going on walks to prepare myself, I use CBD before walks on myself, not even the dog, just so I can stay calm lol"
Dogtraining,fpergwx,t1_fper5ty,1588553371.0,"Exactly, having a reactive dog can be soooo physically and emotionally exhausting especially when you’re always on edge waiting for the moment they could be triggered but still trying to stay calm so you don’t work them up."
Dogtraining,fpeptgq,t1_fpefeai,1588552371.0,"That’s great to hear! My guy is really sensitive with his threshold too, one step too close and it’s all over. Wishing you the best of luck!"
Dogtraining,fpeeyx2,t1_fpe6f51,1588546240.0,"I am by no means a professional trainer, just a fellow reactive dog owner, so I’m just spitballing but maybe you could try to simulate those triggers indoors somehow? Maybe also stay close to home and as soon as they start to get over stimulated immediately take them back inside to show them that they only get to continue their walk and get closer to what excites them if they walk calmly."
Dogtraining,fpe42m9,t1_fpe3qxu,1588539934.0,Maybe try with other high distractions that aren’t birds or you could even get a dummy bird that looks realistic from a distance that way you can easily add/remove it from the situation and have more control to start
Dogtraining,fpe3ao0,t3_gcxs1u,1588539504.0,"Quack cocaine made me laugh lol. Have you been working on “look at me?” Maybe try working on that with no distractions and then slowly work up to more and more distractions (toys, other treats, outside but no ducks) to help her improve her impulse control. VERY slowly you can work on introducing ducks. It will probably take quite some time since it seems she’s very driven by the ducks. Best of luck!"
reactivedogs,fpdhlr6,t1_fpdhfmm,1588527144.0,Thank you! Your positive encouragement means literally so much. People have no idea how emotionally draining it can be to have a reactive dog. Hopefully as he settles more into being in my home he’ll get better at following commands as well!
reactivedogs,fpbhrcd,t1_fpbhhqk,1588470298.0,"It always seems like it happens all at once doesn’t it lol. We just went on another walk and he did great, barely pulled on the leash and did great when a car went by, he didn’t even care! I feel the long walks part. We’ve had more success in walking him for shorter amounts of time more often with lots of play time in between. It’s a little less convenient for me but if it helps him that’s what matters."
reactivedogs,fpbbojs,t1_fpb9rae,1588466378.0,I think I’m going to have to try some boiled chicken. I use pet botanics training reward which he responds to only when he’s really interested. Definitely going to try to up the ante to see if that will help draw his attention away.
reactivedogs,fp9mlyq,t1_fp9g3y5,1588429916.0,Yep I’ve been watching him since long before I adopted my boy! Even rewatching videos I’ve previously seen has been really helpful.
reactivedogs,fp8blej,t1_fp881wj,1588388270.0,I’ll have to check it out! To each their own I guess

BorderCollie,fp62mwv,t1_fp5ql32,1588344905.0,"Mine too! He loves to chew but only stuffed toys, when I give him chew toys he just stares at them lol"
doggos,fp627cp,t1_fp60wq2,1588344672.0,That makes me so happy! We’ve only had him for two days
doggos,fp625yj,t1_fp5fh0e,1588344651.0,"I love it! When he’s standing it’s curly, it’s too cute"
doggos,fp623jg,t1_fp53sda,1588344614.0,He’s a collie mix! Not sure what the mix is though
reactivedogs,fp3vf4k,t1_fp3u97y,1588286532.0,That’s amazing! Just goes to show that no matter the dogs age they can always improve
reactivedogs,fp2k0qm,t1_fp2fg88,1588263080.0,That’s amazing! It’s always so great when they do something good without you even asking them too.
reactivedogs,fp28pb3,t1_fp27nnt,1588257345.0,Yes definitely some anxiety on both of our parts. As soon as things open back up again I plan on getting him into some obedience classes. I guess I just worry a lot that I’m going to mess up ya know
reactivedogs,fp1sg4b,t1_fp0rl1a,1588246425.0,"Wow that was amazing advice and made me feel SO much better thank you! One final question, you think it’s okay that we’re not really working on his skills right now? I just don’t want him to get used to not sitting before going outside and before eating etc."
reactivedogs,fp0rdr4,t1_fp0r6br,1588215237.0,"Thank you so much! I can’t wait to start trying this tomorrow. He’s peacefully sleeping on my bed with me right now, reminding me why I chose to adopt in the first place"
reactivedogs,fp0qo51,t1_fp0qhd9,1588214803.0,"Wow thank you that put me so at ease! The YouTube video idea so genius, I watch YouTube/Netflix all day anyway lol. Do you have any specific videos you recommend?"
Dogtraining,fp0no72,t1_fp0n55v,1588212966.0,Thank you! My biggest fear is that he just won’t stop barking and the neighbors will get annoyed. My complex is super dog friendly and yet I never hear any other neighbor’s dogs bark. Either they are REALLY well behaved or the apartments are more sound proof than I realize. I might put a note on all of their doors (there’s only five other apartments in my building) just explain the situation and thanking them for their patience so at least I don’t seem like an ignorant asshole about it lol.
reactivedogs,fp0n0jq,t1_fp0ks0w,1588212571.0,"Yes very true, I’m definitely trying to put myself in his shoes. Is there anything you can recommend that I can do to help make him more comfortable?"
internships,foq9z8m,t3_g8xqy4,1587988005.0,"The biggest concern I have with that is that for me my school requires an 3 credit internship to graduate. You can either do one three credit or three one credit internships. 3 credits are 120 hours and one credits are 40 hours. I did an all online internship last semester and I struggled hard to hit 40 hours partly because my internship didn’t give me much work but the work I did do only took about an hour or two to complete every week. It obviously could be different but in my opinion online internships are way easier time wise, at least in my field, than in person ones. Online at home you just do the work you have to do and you don’t have to worry about filling the other time to seem busy but in person you do which is why there’s such a time difference. I could always do two more one credit internships but I was hoping to just do one three credit and knock it out of the way. I know that’s more of a personal issue rather than a general one. 

I do think that it would be good for companies to do that though, especially the ones who canceled their in person summer programs. I don’t think location should really matter, maybe a candidate who lives in a different time zone with a 10 hour difference might not be ideal but companies make this work all the time."
dogs,foow7js,t3_g8fmpp,1587947769.0,"I agree with the other commenter not to force it. Let your older dog explore their curiosity naturally and reward each and every positive interaction. They’ll come around slowly, the more you try to force them to interact the worse off you’ll be. Just let it happen and give lots of praise and treats when it does!"
college,fonqnos,t1_fonkv7x,1587924573.0,Political science and public relations
CBD,fonef0o,t1_fone4n2,1587917901.0,"Yeah that’s the other thing I was thinking about too. I think I want to get them as a just in case and see how he is. I’d rather have them and not use them or them not work and just give them to someone else rather than not having them at all. I just want to make it easier on him! If anything I’ll do a really small dose, I’m not trying to sedate him, just ease him a little bit. I guess I’ll just have to wait and see how he is when I get him!"
college,fone37y,t3_g8fah1,1587917721.0,"I’m double majoring, both areas of study on average make around 60k a year but starting salary is like half that. I chose both fields based on what I was interested in and the money isn’t bad. It’s not going to make me rich, but if I hit that 60k average I think I’ll be pretty okay. Fortunately both degrees have a TON of different directions I could take them either combined or separate, so I have plenty of job opportunities and I could get a job literally anywhere in the country with them. I think there is some level of finding a middle ground. You obviously want to make money but I’m definitely an advocate for doing what makes you happy however they say money can’t buy happiness but it can make life a whole lot less stressful so, like I said, you have to find a middle ground. Double major, take on a minor or double minor, that way you can keep a lot of opportunities available to you."
CBD,fona42m,t1_fon8nm7,1587915461.0,Ohh that’s good to keep in mind. I’m definitely right now looking for something that’s a little more calming and less sedative but I’ll keep those in mind for if I need something like that!

college,fon6csr,t1_fon4xaz,1587913207.0,"It’s not a utopian society but, as I’ve said, it’s the perfect opportunity to become okay and unbothered by people making judgements about you and to become more of yourself"
college,fon4nmp,t1_fon1w0n,1587912140.0,"Like I said, college is the perfect environment to learn how to be yourself without caring what others think. When I was getting ready to go to college I was the same way, and I would feel exactly the same as they do. However overtime because I was at school I found friends and formed relationships and surrounded myself with people who make me feel comfortable being me. I had so many more opportunities to explore who I am and really let my own personality grow which you really don’t get to do in high school. What I’m saying is that while it might be challenging, in college you have so much more freedom to be you. Eventually you’ll learn that even if people judge subconsciously, it doesn’t matter as long as YOU are enjoying your life not to mention that the kind of people to judge someone for something like this are not the kind of people anyone should want to be around anyways. Half of the college experience is exploring who you really are and who you want to be. Maybe I just don’t surround myself with the same people you do but I don’t know anyone who would be so much of an asshole that they would take a picture of someone in headgear who obviously has it for a medical reason and send it to their friends. Even the meanest people I know wouldn’t do that."
college,fon1a6e,t3_g8e7j4,1587909843.0,"Idk why everyone is telling you it’s bad. I have a feeling a lot of people commenting are still young, either about to start college in the fall or just starting. As someone who is on their second to last semester I can say that people in college don’t care. They really don’t. It’s not like high school in that way. I could show up to class in a clown costume and maybe someone would ask why but no one would judge. College is the perfect environment to learn how to be yourself without fear of judgement. I understand how you feel but everyone saying that it’s bad and it’s social suicide are wrong. If you really don’t feel comfortable then sure take a gap year, there are plenty of benefits to taking a gap year. However, if you’re just taking a gap year for fear of judgement, there’s no reason to be fearful because I promise the majority of people don’t care and the ones that do suck anyway."
TwoXChromosomes,fon0wqr,t3_g87xd6,1587909575.0,"I’m enjoying being alone, not having to go to class, etc but what’s stressing me out is the unknown. I have a lot of things planned, especially for July and August, that I have no idea are happening or not. I needed to start prepping for them a while ago but I can’t seem to find the motivation because what’s the point if I have no idea if it’s happening? As a college student I won’t mind too bad if next semester is online, despite it being my last, I just hope that my university decides soon because the decision to be online this semester was so last minute. I know some universities will be deciding around mid-summer, I hope mine does the same. Overall I don’t mind the quarantine but I do mind all of the unknowns. I wish we could just say okay everything is canceled for the rest of the year, then I maybe could breathe a little easier."
dogs,fomqfet,t1_fom886e,1587900111.0,"Yeah I think the thing I’m the most nervous for is actually waiting to see how he is around other dogs. So far the owner has made it seem like he’s only a little reactive (barking, pulling at the leash etc) but hasn’t pointed out anything severe, I’m a little nervous for our first walk especially since we live in a town that’s so dog friendly. Fortunately though he’s moving from the city to a rural area so hopefully it’s less of a stressful and more of an exciting chance since there’s so many parks and trails around here!"
dogs,fomq9qx,t1_fom7gby,1587899935.0,"Yes that’s exactly what I was planning on doing! He’s a border collie so I have no doubt he’ll pick up on his new name really quick. After everyone giving me some great advice I’m definitely leaning towards renaming him, thankfully I have a little more time to decide on a name"
