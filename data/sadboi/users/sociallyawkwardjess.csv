But really, I‚Äôm going to give you some advice instead of roasting you because this is just too unfortunate to ignore.

OP, please cut your hair, or do something with it. It looks unkempt and like it‚Äôs thinning so cutting it shorter will look better. 

Invest in something for your teeth. That‚Äôs something you CAN fix and will boost your confidence.

Last thing, get a different face wash or something to clear up that acne. 

TL;DR - cut your hair, get an Invisalign or something, and get a new face wash."
AmItheAsshole,fpxcy8w,t3_gfvw7h,1588980226.0,NTA! That‚Äôs perfect advice and I‚Äôd love to have a grandma like you!!
AmItheAsshole,fos5ybh,t1_for4eeq,1588024572.0,I agree completely. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to forgive my husband for something like that.
