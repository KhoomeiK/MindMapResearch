socialskills,fmtenbe,t3_fxabbi,1586371433.0,"I (24F) have a similar story, girl! After going through an abusive relationship I realized how much I had isolated myself and virtually had no one to reach out to. 

I find it incredibly exhausting to be around people sometimes and I‚Äôm naturally shy, so the hardest part for me was putting myself back out there. Reading books about relationships and attachment has really helped me understand what I went through and recognize the ‚Äúred flags‚Äù of toxic friendships.

You got this! I‚Äôm here if you ever wanna talk"

BPD,fivv266,t3_fa1imx,1582768706.0,"Thank you for this post. I‚Äôm currently in the process of moving across the country with my boyfriend, and I feel uneasy because everything between us is going great. I‚Äôm used to constant yelling and fighting so this is new territory for me. I‚Äôve been surrounded by dysfunction and and abuse my entire life from my family to exes. This is the first time I‚Äôve been supported and loved and it honestly feels weird. I‚Äôve been pushing my boyfriend away because I‚Äôm scared to be happy but after reading your post I‚Äôm realizing that I‚Äôm in love and I never have felt true love before. The ‚Äúlove‚Äù I‚Äôve received has always been contingent on my behavior or based off of how my abuser was feeling. Anytime I received that love it was always followed up with violence or after a violent occurrence so I always have felt like love has to hurt you. Thank you so much for helping me realize that I‚Äôm being showered in love and acceptance."
