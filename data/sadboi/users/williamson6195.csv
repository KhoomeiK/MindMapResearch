As far as maximizing time, (20 minutes seems short if you‚Äôre not doing well but I digress), write everything down on your phone or in a notepad. Track your mood and bring that to the appointment.

CPTSD,firy95l,t3_f9fsic,1582673559.0,"I cry in the shower or a private bathroom at work. Just slap some cold water on my eyes and I‚Äôm fine. I would not recommend the work one unless it‚Äôs an emergency, but sometimes you just gotta cry when you gotta cry."
CPTSD,firx910,t3_f980bs,1582672928.0,"Sure do. I pretty much just watch tv and sleep and go to work. Idk if it‚Äôs a ‚Äú40 hours a week‚Äù thing and just being existentially exhausted from being mentally ill, however, it might also be a CPTSD thing. I basically was forced into activities I didn‚Äôt enjoy, and tbh in my ‚Äúformative years‚Äù I was literally just screamed at constantly so I feel like I don‚Äôt know how to build a personality out of fear of upsetting someone else."
bipolar2,firvap4,t3_f9gdvb,1582671878.0,"Yeah if I was doing that I‚Äôd be spending 100, I do monthly psychiatry and biweekly therapy and it comes out to $75. And I have government insurance. I feel your pain :( healthcare is too expensive (don‚Äôt forget about meds!)"

CPTSD,fip8ai0,t1_fip88kf,1582600254.0,I also do this. Taking on others emotions. It‚Äôs exhausting
CPTSD,fip634f,t1_fip5zr8,1582598851.0,"I couldn‚Äôt even call it an argument tbh. I was upset over a perceived slight and was mad for maybe 20 minutes and we resolved it in 5. But I woke up this morning at 2 am spiraling and it just went from there. 

Unfortunately I can‚Äôt stay in bed all day (especially tomorrow) but i sure do want to."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fip525j,t3_f92ut1,1582598196.0,"I‚Äôm currently dealing with spiraling anxiety from a very small fight with my current partner. Distraction seems to work the best for me, and writing down my thoughts on my phone so I can come back to them if it‚Äôs something I wish to continue discussing."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fiomamn,t3_f8r2o3,1582586015.0,"I didn‚Äôt realize my ex was a narcissist of sorts until long after we broke up (he broke up with me and I was heart broken). My dad is one, and much more of an overt narcissist. I‚Äôm not even sure my ex is a narcissist, I need to do more research, but I thought I‚Äôd share anyway. 

I still feel a lot of anger at how I was treated, and how I let myself be treated for the sake of love. I conflated passion with arguing and it‚Äôs definitely taken a toll on me. I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôve fully grieved, but now that I‚Äôm in a new relationship, I find myself carrying the trauma and the behaviors with me. It‚Äôs not good and I‚Äôm trying to work on it now. 

Don‚Äôt grieve like I did. I turned to substances and lost my weekend activities because I was usually black out. I ruined potential relationships. I almost blew up friendships. But I learned I had to grow up eventually and take care of myself and try to right what had happened. 

There are still days I‚Äôm incredibly triggered. I find myself thinking about what I should‚Äôve done differently, how I should‚Äôve reacted, how we should‚Äôve stayed broken up when I wanted, etc. Maybe I‚Äôm still grieving. But it‚Äôs a process. Therapy has helped a lot. How can you trust again? It takes time. It‚Äôs again, a process. I still don‚Äôt fully trust my boyfriend even though he‚Äôs done nothing to warrant that. So I‚Äôll say the right partner will work through it with you if you‚Äôre not 100% there when you start or even if you get into it and then realize you‚Äôre not ready (which is what happened to me)

Sorry, this got long. Point is grieving is a process, and some day you‚Äôll look at yourself and realize that you‚Äôre exactly where you‚Äôve always dreamed of and envisioned. Just embrace the process."

CPTSD,fil7l1v,t1_fikdew9,1582495382.0,"I‚Äôd say those are ultimately all good things! Some people say mania feels great, or hypomania, but in most cases it‚Äôs also destructive and too high of a high. From what you‚Äôre describing, I wouldn‚Äôt say you sound manic, but I‚Äôm also not a doctor."
CPTSD,fik7886,t1_fijl9zg,1582474357.0,"For me, mood tracking has really helped me to analyze my moods and determine if they‚Äôre just regular happy or too intense happy. Ups and downs can happen with CPTSD, though I think with bipolar the ups and downs tend to last longer and aren‚Äôt always triggered by something happening."

Makes my brain really not work sometimes. But I‚Äôve been on the trileptal for about 2-3 weeks and I‚Äôm actually starting to feel sharper. I really am. There‚Äôs lots of meds out there and you can totally try to find the right med or cocktail for you!"
BipolarReddit,fic34l3,t3_f7h981,1582336444.0,"I definitely share before the partner stage. Like... in the exclusive stage. Usually once sex is on table because that‚Äôs when attachments can form. My current boyfriend is kind of complicated in how we got together, however, he has known from the beginning. Historically people who have become my boyfriend find out relatively quickly."
bipolar2,fic1umq,t1_fic1kc0,1582335534.0,"Just don‚Äôt set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. And therapy for yourself sounds like a really good idea.

I don‚Äôt mean to be harsh, but it sounds like he‚Äôs making excuses to take care of himself. It‚Äôs hard to care for, yes, but ultimately self medicating with weed won‚Äôt help."
