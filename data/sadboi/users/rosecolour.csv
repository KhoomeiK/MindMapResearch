It takes work on my part too, I have to be understanding of the fact that he has gay friends and he will want to spend time with them and that doesn't mean that he's going to fuck them or cheat on me with them. I've been cheated on before so he gets that and is super open with me to the point that if he's hanging out with someone, he shows me the convo in his phone and tells me ""we're gonna go to wherever and do whatever"" even though I don't ask him to.

&#x200B;

If your boyfriend is purposely making you jealous, he's not the one. Seriously. Don't go down that path. When two people get together you do the mature thing and realize that while something is not downright cheating, if it hurts your significant other and it's not asking the world of you to stop, you stop. Out of respect for them and their feelings, you stop doing what was bothering them.

&#x200B;

He's obviously not doing that. And if he can't respect your feelings then you're going to lash out because you're feeling unheard.

I was the one who encouraged him to do a video call with his girlfriends, it would be beyond stupidly immature to emotionally punish him for it. 

&#x200B;

I also had to remind myself that we do have that fun together and he does laugh that hard with me. I had to sit there and create a list in my head of all the times we laughed hysterically together or the fun times we've had together. And after he was done with them, I kept that thought in my head and the next time I made him laugh I thought ""damn, how stupid was I being before? We do have a lot of fun with each other"" When you're too caught up in your feelings, you tend to remember things in a way that fits your narrative. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I think something important to remember is that when you're dating someone, you develop a more relaxed and comfortable energy around them. Basically, you don't feel the pressure to be ""on"" the way you do with your friends.

&#x200B;

Even I'm guilty of being way more rowdy and jokey with my friends than I am with my boyfriend. When your boyfriend is playing games with his buds, they're probably all competing a little to say the funniest thing, he probably doesn't feel that way with you. And that's fine. He doesn't feel the need to constantly have this joking, fun energy with you because he's comfortable with you.

I think it’s far more realistic for them to not be together and for the new series to rebuild that lovely Lizzie/Gordo romantic tension when they come back together. (Assuming they haven’t kept in contact)"
kennyvsspenny,fphmnd3,t1_fph0e90,1588623968.0,"I feel like a lot of y’all don’t notice how PC Kenny already is. The guy said himself that he mostly rips of jews because he is one. Most times we’ve seen him be outright racist, it’s done to mock Spenny or to just set off a response from him."
kennyvsspenny,fphmeui,t1_fph7220,1588623846.0,"I doubt Kenny will do crowdfunding, he’s really bitter about the idea after no one helped Jaimie with his."
habbo,fpfi62s,t1_fpdkr1m,1588571976.0,"Fallin furni and cozzie change still exist but not as often. Some of the new ones are Bank Game, Heaven or Hell, Danger Pods, Fridge Banzai.

They’re pretty much all based on luck and pretty fun to mindlessly play through."
rocksmith,fpdxv2s,t3_gctlft,1588536414.0,"I got a lot of laughs the other day when I decided to jam out in session mode with my bass and the kazoo. That kazoo really goes hard lmao 


But I agree. I really love session mode. I’m a bass player and I’ve never met anyone who plays an instrument so I’ve always had to play alone or play along to a track. It’s really nice to improv with an actual band."
AskReddit,fpb84ls,t1_fpb6gp5,1588464141.0,"Dogs are animals and you should always remember that no matter how well behaved your dog is. A perfect dog can still bite you if you touch it and it has an injury there that you’re unaware of.

You should always watch your back with a dog. 


But the point still stands, no one should ever complain about a chihuahua not allowing you to do something when you are bigger, stronger and more dominant than it. They are animals and you should treat them as such. They will cower and bow to dominate energy because in the animal world, if you do not, they know they’ll be killed.

Your dogs know that too if you’ve ever had to put them in their place."
AskReddit,fpadao2,t1_fpa7iic,1588445781.0,"It doesn’t matter how badly trained the dog is. It’s instinctual for the dog to obey dominate energy or the dog will believe you will kill it. 

I’ve been to dozens of seminars on this shit and I’ve seen it for myself. Dogs who behave perfectly with me but attack the owner or other groomers that can’t control their confidence."
habbo,fp8mvdw,t3_gbkslz,1588396626.0,"Honestly I just hangout in the game rooms. Habbo has come a long way since cozzie change and fallin furni being the only games available lmao.

&#x200B;

But yeah, that seems to really be all there is to do on habbo. Whenever I look at the top rooms it's either some FBI/CIA/Police agency job roleplay stuff or one of those ""fansite"" game things. I get a lot of enjoyment from those game rooms, even if I hardly end up playing lol."
cokemusic,fp8lxdh,t3_fohzxf,1588395846.0,"I haven't checked on this in a hot minute but I'm still so impressed and happy that someone is rebuilding this game and keeping the dream alive.

Always happy to see an update for this and thanks again for putting in the work."
AskReddit,fp8h97c,t3_gbt1n8,1588392252.0,"Speaking as a dog groomer, I have to say the welsh terrier. I haven't met a single one that doesn't have extreme anxiety. Airedale's are a very close second. Those ones basically just come down to poor training. They're big and have insane energy, if they're not trained in how to channel that energy, it's really awful."
AskReddit,fp8gv31,t1_fp7yqqh,1588391964.0,">Chihuahuas are broken ass, over bred, maniacal beasts. Pomeranians are right next to them. Nothing worse than a five-pound punk ass dog telling you where you can and can't sit.

Speaking as someone who's worked with many small breeds, there's no such thing as a dog who won't let you do something. Every dog is your bitch if you have the right confidence around them. I get embarrassed for the customer when they try to tell me that their 5 pound dog ""won't let them brush their hair"" or their afraid of being bit by it lmao. The people with german shepherds I can at least somewhat sympathize with them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

No such thing as a bad dog, just people who have no business owning one."
AskReddit,fp8gibf,t1_fp7xmd8,1588391705.0,The smaller poodle breeds (miniature and toy) also suffer from seizures. I work as a dog groomer and have had the misfortune of seeing it for myself more than once.

NoStupidQuestions,fp7q5me,t1_fp7por5,1588375504.0,"This is true. As a guy who has his own insecurities about possible future hair loss, looking for advice on it usually results in men just telling you to accept it, be a man and grow a beard."

The only thing I can guess is that they have enough money to waste and they buy reddit coins to support the website."
AnimalCrossing,fp7p8vh,t3_gbngpv,1588374986.0,commenting in hopes some of your good fortune rubs off on me.
AnimalCrossing,fp7kbg2,t1_fp7i0e2,1588372235.0,I don't think so. I believe your best bet is giving them furniture in hopes they will replace the clothing with it.
AnimalCrossing,fp7k3ur,t1_fp7idqf,1588372122.0,"You can likely find some on the other pinned thread for trading friend codes. I've only had one night of shooting stars so far :( 

And horrible luck where the only time I saw a shooting star, it was in the middle of a villager talking to me and I missed it lol.

Celeste will show up regardless of shooting stars happening. Good luck!"

NoStupidQuestions,fp788ct,t1_fp69j08,1588365830.0,"Girls who have their tracks showing. definitely get made fun of as well. 

The newer hair systems for men are damn near flawless and nobody can even notice them to make fun of you for it. From what I’ve seen people are generally really supportive of these newer hair replacement systems.

It’s the tacky cartoonish toupees that are made fun of."

I never said anything they suggested now would prevent the NS thing from happening. I said we'll likely get more info about more they're planning. There's already lots of articles talking about the border being the real issue. I'm sure the government is looking into it.

And see my other comments about paint jobs. I've already said that the article linked says absolutely nothing about aesthetics which is what this entire conversation is revolving around. The article linked in the post. Stop talking about aesthetics."
