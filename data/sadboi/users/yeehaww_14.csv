depression,ez3zq9p,t1_ez3o01b,1567678392.0,"It seems like i'm talking to my younger self..although i dont know how similar your situation is to mine, i've had a bf i wasnt sure that i was in love with. It was a long distance relationship and whenever he used to come down to meet me once a year..he used to be all excited and expect love. While i was always distant and closed. I was not even excited. Well 8months down and i broke up with him for something he did (legit reason only) and i fucked up an entrance exam and my best friends stopped talking to me and they were too busy even when i said i needed help. 3 years depressed and i hung on. I kept pushing away people and never opened completely to anyone. But i made friends with whom i hang out with..i dont really talk stuff but i have good friends. And somehow a few people came around and stuck over the years. And they know i get all weird and zone out but they give me my space and let me be myself and they just stay there. And i met an amazing guy and we became good friends. i never opened up entirely with him  for almost an year ...i hardly used to speak anything but along the line, we started having feelings and dated for another year and still had problems with communicating my feelings...but he stuck around and helped me with that. And i started openinh up and another 6months down the line he broke up  with me after a few months due to us being of different religions and that his parents can never accept us. Been 5months since the breakup and someone just rejected me yesterday for a job i havent even applied for(they wanted me, and then they didnt) and have no best friends really. But guess what..i'm over the guy i have fell deeply in love with. I dont think about him much anymore nor am i depressed. And top of all..i dont care if anyone is there in my life or not. I hangout with my friends sometimes but i enjoy staying by myself so very much that i have to turn down their invites! I dont do drugs ..i just stick with my books and i am content with it. What i can tell you is, its not going to be easy..you are gonna take a hell lot of time to be happy with just yourself but you will go there depending on how good you are understanding and giving yourself time to figure yourself out. And everyone is going to let you down eventually..but you are going to be fine with that one day. And about you opening up..its going to happen when you are given that environment with someone. And its not going to happen anytime soon. But dont hide stuff from your own self..be as transparent as you can be with yourself. And dont be afraid when someone wants to be friends with you..dont share your stuff right away....good relationships need time to grow! Once you've been for enough time with them to know what kind of a person they are and if you think they are worth letting them a little into your mind..then do it. But dont share anything entirely to them within the first few months of knowing them that when they leave you are broken. You gotta develop coping strategies to handle this stuff healthier. All the best :)"

depression,ez3mw88,t1_ez3mhic,1567670676.0,So do you have anyone in your life right now who care about you ? Being forever alone is not bad as long as you are happy by yourself. Are you happy by yourself ?
depression,ez3jpgw,t1_ez3g2ci,1567668638.0,"i can relate to you on this. Even i used to be this way... everything used to run smooth untill they start becoming close, once they decide to keep me as a priority..i used to turn out into an asshole and give them a hardtime, closing myself off and stuff. With my experience..things like these happen as a reflection of rooted experiences that you might have faced earlier in life,due to which your brain uses shuttinh yourself off as a defence to not end up being hurt. So, if you really wanna keep your relations healthy then you gotta look back and analyse your life from the time you remember. You gotta re-collect incidents from the first time you've started to behave this way and make peace with that particular incident. It takes a lot of time. Once that's done, You  need to prepare yourself to the fact that.. its only fair to let some people in, those who really want to care for you. But dont have unrealistic expectations that they will never hurt you. It happens voluntarily or involuntarily, but you gotta decide whom you let in."

depression,eyocogy,t1_eyoc4fc,1567274388.0,"Aww thats really nice too! But the one thing with people who are depressed is that they go back into their own pit and it's all back to as bad as it was. I guess all you can or anyone can ever do is try being very sensitive towards them and its important that you try to show them that you are trying to be there for them. And taking your puppy is one good way to do that! But dont feel bad if he doesnt let you in , because at the end you can only help someone if they want to be helped."
