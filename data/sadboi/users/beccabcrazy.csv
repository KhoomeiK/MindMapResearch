birthcontrol,fnkb9v9,t3_g240jj,1587020809.0,I've been on Depo for almost a year. I love it and my periods stopped. Unfortunately my sex drive is so low. I will have to find another bc because of this issue. Other than that I had no other side effects.
China_Flu,fkjswvi,t3_fivph5,1584258193.0,Thank you for posting this. I'm a hairdresser and I'm shocked no one is canceling their appointments. I feel trapped at work and we are in close contact with all clients.
Whatcouldgowrong,fcvkdqq,t3_ej0iow,1578003966.0,Hahaha! This is my stepdad. Front page on reddit!! He always sends weather updates to friends from out of state. For those wondering he is orginally from Mississippi.
secretsanta,famvz6p,t3_e9swfu,1576214505.0,Ooooo I love this color green! They will love it all!
Anxiety,f9j8ugf,t3_e529rn,1575361476.0,I'm a hairdresser. So I couldnt agree more with this. Some people suck the life out of me. I'm constantly around people which can either heighten my anxiety or make for a fun interaction.
delusionalartists,f53gumo,t1_f510cl5,1571959717.0,Well hot damn! He's gonna put me out of a job.
delusionalartists,f500f8n,t3_dm6e20,1571919596.0,Oh what a lovely chemical cut. He clearly also cuts hair as well. What a mess!
electronic_cigarette,f4zyfqk,t1_f4zwgfs,1571918483.0,Awesome! Thanks for responding. I couldnt understand even looking all online.
electronic_cigarette,f4zy8yr,t1_f4zmdh0,1571918380.0,Thank you so much for answering! I've watched youtube videos about it but it's just people saying how much they love it. Like yeah I love it too but wasnt getting the answers I wanted since its new to me.
funny,f1lugd5,t1_f1lsoc7,1569569581.0,Absolutely! Especially with clients who are difficult. Haha
funny,f1lucku,t1_f1lpyo5,1569569418.0,Probably only funny to hairdressers. Some people are difficult at the shampoo bowl or cant stop touching their hair when there. I'd be lying if I said I didnt want to spray some of the difficult clients. Haha
funny,f1lu5bs,t1_f1l3j1r,1569569112.0,I'm a hairdresser and follow this person on istagragram. I do not remember his name. It's basically a silly joke for the hairdressers. Some clients cant keep their hands out of their hair or are difficult at the shampoo bowl. It would be a lie if I said I'd didnt want to spray the more difficult ones. Haha
depression,eoht80b,t3_brsy1y,1558594503.0,I would see a doctor and see if you have PMDD. I would get motivated in spurs along with a bunch of other things that actually sounded similar to bipolar. I then realized this would only occur a week before my period monthly. I got put on a better birth control and what I though could be bipolar was actually PMS on crack.
Art,eob4b7p,t1_eob2t7k,1558434788.0,Huh?
Art,eoauqjp,t3_br5mlg,1558428398.0,Wow love it! You did such a good job! I didnt know she passed away though. Rip
