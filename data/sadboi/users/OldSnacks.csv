I found my bio dad around my early 20s, after being told my whole life that he was a psycho that would murder us if he found us (surprise, he wasn't, I just preferred him to her when I was a child before she took me and left).  

And when I finally told her about her husband molesting me for 9 years (my step farther), she made the whole ordeal about how I destroyed her marriage (even when we would have to talk to the state's attorney for the trail or child services).  Then she made a deal in her divorce that I could never sue him civally, or else he could take part of the house. 

Kudos to you for going and sticking with NC for so long!  I'm getting better at letting more and more time lapse between contact, but still can't commit to full time out of fear she'll do something to herself out of spite."

It seems like North East has a lot of privately owned rentals too but they may be pricer (I've only been in Minnesota for two years so my advice isn't worth much but wanted to pitch in in case it helps).

AskReddit,fmw9bis,t1_fmvaek8,1586442245.0,"Speaking from experience, it's easier to repeat those stories as a narrator, instead of a participant.

Especially for young girls since they usually have to repeat the stories over and over for the courts or the social workers or the therapists, so it just becomes this deadpan matter-of-fact tone.  

Still just awful that anyone ever has to go through this shit.  Sexual predators that go after children should be put in jail or some kind of group house for life.  Unfortunately mine never even saw the inside of a jail cell.

IWantToLearn,fm8h1xg,t1_fm8fw34,1585849247.0,"Oh with the mix of mental illness in the family and narcissistic parent, I'd double recommend just taking a look.  BPD is verrrryyy closely linked to PTSD (especially from narcissistic parents, mine was my mom so I feel you and see you what you're saying, unlike our parents).  If the borderline just doesn't jive, no harm no foul, BUT dialectical behavior therapy workbooks might still help just to self manage a bit and give some coping skills.  Honestly, I struggled for a long time (until my late twenties) wondering what was wrong with me and why I would get triggered so easily and then not be able to escape the anger.  Finding a name for it helped me do the research to manage it better, but if you're finding that you get triggered and then can move on later, maybe it's something else.  Borderline just isn't talked about very often in any kind of positive light so I try to help anyone who might be confused and need that formal word for it like I did.  

Either way, it sounds like you are on the right track in your quest!  Sorry your family is difficult and crazy too but I'm glad you were able to get past all of it to a successful life!  You've nailed all the really hard stuff, finding a way to manage the emotions is going to be a piece of cake once you get the right resources, whatever that may be.  You got this!"

I struggled with the same issues except my anger was really crazy and honestly, once I found the diagnosis and got some workbooks, it helped IMMENSELY with being able to recognize and stop the immediate reactions that other people tend to not like.  Granted, I still struggle and can't control them all, but it's really helped me at least understand the triggers and try and apply a logical filter to them before my emotional brain can overreact and I say something when I shouldn't.  

I'm not a doctor, that's just my two cents and maybe it'll help you.  Just please don't be turned off by the stigma of the disorder, there's a lot of angry people that love to blame things on Borderlines because there are of course some bad apples in the bunch, but also a ton that want to improve their symptoms and just don't know how.
