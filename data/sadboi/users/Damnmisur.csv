VALORANT,fprie8e,t1_fpnd12b,1588854926.0,"Nope, these types of software leave vulnerabilities for cheaters. They won't be fixed unless it's from the side of Asus, MSi,  etc. which will never happen. Valorant would rather you fry your computer than lose a game.   They should compromise like every other game.  Smdh"

BPD,eyd13kn,t1_eycxolu,1567009681.0,I'll look into this as well.  I feel like this.  I've got nicknames for different personalities but I'm aware of each one.  I do dissociate under stress but not in a DID sense.  Thank you for this
BPD,eycxk39,t3_cwmqgx,1567008303.0,"Intrusive thoughts are the bane of my existence.  I hear my own voice constantly beating me down.  When I'm weak enough it goes to self injury thoughts and Sichuan ideation.  I don't feel I have control of these thoughts.  I've been on meds and I've tried ""coping"" mechanisms.  I feel in my own experience that I need help getting past self loathing and low self esteem. Meds work some of the time but there's always things that trigger it for me.  Hope this helps you feel that you're not alone.  I know how scary intrusive thoughts can be."

Waxpen,eubdj49,t3_cfnz93,1563645540.0,"I've got a Sai top flow.  It's similar to the Sequoia.  I prefer a bucket for cleaning.  I use the titanium because it doesn't leak over into the coil.  The quartz bucket I have is 2 pieces and can leak into the coil.  The bucket then sticks to the coil.  Cleaner, smoother hits with a bucket and easy cleanup if you do it right away."

BPD,esu1s3p,t3_c91b16,1562276625.0,Over 40 G's in debt.  I still buy computer parts instead of paying bills/debt.  Spend around $200 a week on pot too.  I'm way to stressed about money but can't stop making bad decisions.
BPD,eshxom6,t1_eshdqou,1562002963.0,Other than diagnosis of depression as a teen (not that I wasn't depressed) my situation is very similar.  My problem is I can't get anyone to take me seriously because I'm a male and have the quiet version.  I can't seem to find a local therapist that specializes in DBT or BPD.

BPD,eqa6hxl,t3_bxwk5w,1559926282.0,"I'm going through this at the moment.  I freaked out when they didn't want to talk to me and convinced them to ""stay friends"".  When that didn't work and there was time apart I started realizing the damage they were doing to me.  I thought I found someone who understood but in actuality I found an abuser.  I didn't realize how much they insulted me and played mind games, I was to afraid to be alone.  My situation is a little more complex as I'm not completely alone but it felt as though I would be if I lost my FP.  I know I'm better off for letting them go."

Given relationships are a trigger, I've been a mess for over 6 months."
