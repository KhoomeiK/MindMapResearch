offmychest,fpt3yhx,t3_gfa7qm,1588884449.0,This is an entire mood.

AirpodsPro,focqig0,t1_focos9i,1587674525.0,Yes. Thereâ€™s rumors that Apple are releasing something new this year for AirPods but I have no clue because Iâ€™m just glad to have the pros. lol
AirpodsPro,focaukn,t1_focaejl,1587669142.0,I was seeing quite the comparisons between these and the SONY wireless earbuds and I was surprised. I like Sonyâ€™s Loudspeaker quality but Iâ€™m transitioning to Marshall since my taste in musicâ€™s expanding.
AirpodsPro,foca6eg,t1_foc877b,1587668915.0,I thought they were supposed to have some form of resistance to water... (?). Did you contact Apple about it yet?
AirpodsPro,foc7u06,t1_fo9jekb,1587668125.0,That sounds strange... is it something youâ€™ve attempted to troubleshoot?
AirpodsPro,foc7nct,t1_fo9zrw0,1587668060.0,"For what itâ€™s worth, the noise cancellation caught me off guard at first! But Iâ€™m getting the hang of them!"

AirpodsPro,foc7aw4,t1_fobj36z,1587667942.0,I had the 2nd gens from 2019. I recently upgraded to the current AirPod Pros. I hear more are being released soon.
AirpodsPro,fo8gnea,t1_fo7xcto,1587596186.0,Thank youuuu
AirpodsPro,fo7xctm,t1_fo7wlsz,1587586163.0,Taurus szn ftw
mentalhealth,fn8mk5n,t3_fplncz,1586745101.0,"This is exactly what Iâ€™ve been battling with for months... I had to realize that you have to mentally align yourself with what you wish to manifest... itâ€™s still discouraging because you feel like what you want to manifest is what everyone else once, so you begin to feel small... Iâ€™m just hoping to remember that my own pace is what I have to take."
