Concordia,fo9emde,t3_g63dnf,1587617411.0,"This is giving me a bit of anxiety. I’m assuming quebecois students aren’t eligible because we have AFE, right...? 

Personally, I applied for EI last month, because my managers at work advised me to. My current situation is that Im a full time uni student, i work part time and also have help through the AFE. As a result, I’ve been receiving money from EI... but now I’m worried that I’ve applied for the wrong type of help, and have too much $$$ coming in, and that I’m going to look like a whole ass scammer?! If anyone has any kinda advice, I’d appreciate it. I’ve been calling Canada revenue for like 5 days now, and have had no luck talking to an agent."
Cooking,fo215qm,t3_g4z572,1587446647.0,"Sourdough French toast changed the game for me a few years ago. specifically stale sourdough, I really don’t think I’d ever use another bread for it again. 

It gets nice and toasted around the edges with little effort, yet stays soft (but not soggy) in the centre, so it absorbs syrup really evenly and nicely… unlike regular bread or even challah which (in my opinion) can be a little too limp / soggy! 

And my favourite way to serve it is with extra cinnamon, real maple syrup, some berries and whipped cream 😇😇"

I received it in the winter and up until July 1st, was on a windowsill (that had a heater right underneath it).  during that time i was directed to water it about once a month but to check on it once a week to make sure the heater was keeping it humid but wasn’t warming it to death. It’s been this colour for about 2 months. Recently moved and now it’s on a shelf by the balcony in indirect sunlight. I’ve watered it about biweekly since depending on the humidity/weather, because it has been really touch and go 😫"
