Turns out my heart was perfectly fine but my mental health is so fucked that during an outburst the high levels of stress affected my heart. Right now i still get pain in my heart from time to time. Not good in the long term. Nonetheless if you can go to a doc man

I just got into a new store job and i already want to fucking quit. I'm too dumb to learn some profession and make a decent career so i'm stuck doing all these low quality wage slave jobs and guess what? I don't even qualify for them because my body is too weak and i get absolutely exhausted. Oh before the data entry i was an intern in an IT company and that just proved to me that i'm too dumb for a decent job. Fuck all of this shit."
