No better and no worse

I just got lost!
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along will come
A bigger one

And you'll be lost!
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh and I'm just waiting til the firing's stopped

Yeah

That ain't even a half what they might do

See Biggie, see Pac
See success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus
See success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
If you succeed prepare to be crucified
Media meddles
Niggaz sue you, you settle
Every step you take
They remind you, you're ghetto
So it's tough being Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then you have to be Bobby now
And the question is, is to have had and lost
Better than not having at all?
Because I'm...

He claimed to have been concerned with teaching that there is no salvation outside the Roman Catholic Church, and felt he could not understand a God that would torture people eternally in hell.

As a young adult, Morneau was introduced to spiritualism through a friend, and nearly joined a secret order of spirit worshipers who claimed to be the ""elite""."
