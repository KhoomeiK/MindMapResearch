Also if it’s falling out a lot caffeine rinse helps to stop it just rinse your hair with green tea or black tea (there’s videos on YouTube that are more detailed) if you don’t want to do that I like to use alpecin caffeine shampoo it pretty much does the something. 

All in all it’s really hard to stop thinning hair if your diet isn’t right. This is one of the things that actually provoked me to eat more regularly I noticed how unhealthy I looked; my skin looked so discoloured and my hair would full out in clumps."
EatingDisorders,fottk9w,t3_g9jhg2,1588065627.0,"Try to eat normally for a good week so no restricting no binging, just 3 normally portioned meals with some treats. I’ve found when I go through phases of restricting and not losing any weight this helps bring my body back to normal and then I start losing weight again. It also stops you thinking you have to eat every “bad” food in less than a day because you have to be super strict the following days. This way you space it out, and can still lose weight in a healthy manner."

EatingDisorders,fonf0u0,t3_g8h18e,1587918234.0,"Oh I do, I can binge nuts and dried fruit and entire packs of multiple fruits in one go. However binging on only healthy food is quite rare for me it only happens if I literally have no junk food at home or am trying really hard to be healthy. 

Usually if I start a binge with junk food I’ll always end it with binging on healthy foods. Balance I guess :/  for example if I’ve just finished a pizza I’ll eat multiple fruits or vegetables after."
