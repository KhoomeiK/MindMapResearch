Once a month doesn’t sound terribly detrimental as long as you recognize that it’s not good for you in the long run, which it sounds like you do. Either way addictions suck and anxiety about your addictions sucks worse, sorry you’re going through that.

Someone I was dating who was depressed while I wasn’t, I sometimes felt like they were bringing me down. It’s hard because you want to help and support them, but need to keep your own mental health where you want it to be.

I dated someone else while we were both pretty depressed, we had good times but ultimately I could tell after we broke up that we were both kinda bringing each other down unfortunately.

Dated someone who had never really gone through depression while I definitely was. I wanted them to be there for me and sometimes got mad when they weren’t, but also had guilt for those moments when I was like hey I really really need you and could tell they weren’t 100% mentally ready for the big task of comforting me and cheering me up. Cause I’m depressed, there’s a lot of bad days. I can’t expect them to read my mind to know when it’s *really* important.

Long story short it kinda sucks on both sides of the coin. I’m really sorry you’re having a shitty day though and that he’s not helping. If you can think of it this way, I’d rather have someone be honest and tell me they need a little break for themselves, than to maybe half heartedly listen to you while not being 100% there.
