EatingDisorders,fo806bf,t1_fo61tga,1587587566.0,The last paragraph hits home for me! If I could/would stop then I would be fine. But I don’t want to.
EatingDisorders,fo7zzq0,t1_fo25l3v,1587587475.0,"It feels weird to know that you have an eating disorder. Because then it’s like, why are you doing it? And the answer is I don’t know!"
EatingDisorders,fo5guol,t1_fo3xarc,1587525319.0,"You’re so right. This is incredibly insightful.

I wish I could unchoose it. But like you said at the beginning, I’ve never really tried because I don’t want to (but I probably actually couldn’t if I tried)."

EDAnonymous,fo3w3ua,t1_fo2pt8p,1587493931.0,Thank you! I’m not diagnosed either.
EDAnonymous,fo3w1k5,t1_fo25jkb,1587493900.0,Me too! I feel like I could stop anytime so it’s not real.... but I’ve never actually tried to stop because it doesn’t feel unhealthy to me. Which is a sign that I’m unhealthy. I guess.
CICO,fo20qcp,t3_g52bva,1587446302.0,You look great!

EDAnonymous,fnx112s,t3_g41jqn,1587329377.0,"Yes!! I made some good ass somewhat healthy super dark chocolate cupcakes the other day tho and ate a bunch without feeling bad:


80g cocoa powder (I used dark but you don’t have to)

90g whole wheat flour

2 tsp baking powder

1/4 tsp salt

2 tbsp butter or butter substitute

2 large eggs or egg substitute

1 tbsp vanilla extract

1/4 cup something creamy (original Amy’s recipe used greek yogurt, I used cream cheese)

2/3 cup maple syrup

1/4 cup nonfat milk


Mix, pour into mini cupcake tin, bake at 350 F for roughly 20 mins. For me it made 29 and each of them were about 50 calories. You could eat all of em and stay under 1500."
EDanonymemes,fnx0dcp,t3_g4bc1u,1587329007.0,fuck I want a hot dog
CICO,fnwzjym,t1_fnwv2u5,1587328548.0,"Honestly, I’m not super strict about it. If I go over by a tiny bit I don’t freak out, and there are days that I just say “fuck it I’m not logging today”. However, there are also days when I eat like 500 calories so IDK.

The main things for me are drinking water or tea when I’m hungry, avoiding most snacks, and eating as many fruits and vegetables as I can.

A normal day for me would be like 35 pretzel sticks (99 cal) and 1 navel orange (50 cal) for lunch, and dinner with maybe meat and a starch and a salad (800/900 cal).

I’m a student and my school went online, and I lost my job. This means I can lay in bed/on the couch in my pajamas until 3 pm. At that point, I might as well wait until dinner. I find that I can eat a normal sized dinner and not be hungry afterwards.

Congrats on losing 40+!!!!! Do you feel tired with 1000?"
