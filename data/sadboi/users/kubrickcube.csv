All that shit they say that love comes suddenly and in the most unexpected way is true. Suffering is included in a relationship, but that's life I guess. Feelings are worth to be felt. Patience might not be out strongest skill, but it's worth to wait. Maybe it will take years, but one day you'll look back and realise that it's so good to be alive and that you are a brave and loved human being. Take care!"
