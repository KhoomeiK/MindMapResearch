popping,fmv2ulm,t3_fxlamb,1586404692.0,Yikes! I’ve had lymph nodes in my armpits get swollen but never that large. I’m so sorry. Could you try to do a virtual visit with your insurance provider? We have United Healthcare and one of the services is a virtual visit and you can use video or photos. They could then at least direct you to a possible urgent care. I wouldn’t think urgent cares would be accepting COVID patients or testing for COVID. I hope you find relief! Have you been trying hot compresses?

Times 2 and 3 took me setting the mood with tranquil music and trying to meditate a bit and get out of my head. Took a bit for my hands to stop shaking and feel calm enough to take the first hit."
