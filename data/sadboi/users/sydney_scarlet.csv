Flirting,fq89vwj,t3_gha5ti,1589161471.0,"It’s not flirting. It’s an office and it’s just something for them to talk about. If you like her shoot your shot. Like you said, she’ll be gone so if you get rejected you won’t have to see her. I think it’s just playful behavior. It’ll go away soon. Best of luck."
Flirting,fp69ei7,t3_gbgy3v,1588348435.0,it looks like he’s flirting so i’d say throw in some pickup lines or something and if they fail u can laugh and be like “i was just joking”
Flirting,fp693kg,t3_gbfh0q,1588348283.0,Honestly she isn’t flirting she’s just being nice. i could be wrong but that’s my opinion.
depression,fp1wpz9,t3_gajysh,1588249905.0,"Honestly you deserve more people like that. they will call and check up on you because they love you. you are insanely lucky to have someone try and help you recover. do not go back to alcohol. i’m not here to tell you how to run your life but she’s trying to help you get clean, please don’t throw it away. honestly, call or text her and tell her that you love her and mean it. it doesn’t matter your cried or aren’t happy. we as people cannot control that. wish you luck!"
Flirting,fp1wb7m,t3_gai36c,1588249593.0,I think it goes either way. she could be flirting to she could be friendly. try to meetup with her on campus and i think that will show her intentions. also you could just ask. ik it’s weird but just ask and she might mention a girlfriend or crush or she might be straight. good luck!!
Flirting,fo41b32,t3_g50orq,1587496493.0,"Not at all. He kissed her once and it’s obvious you both like each other. He would be an ass if he saw you happy and called you a snake. He should have pursued her already if he liked her. It would also be selfish of him to tell you not do to what makes you happy. I say fair game. Also, SHE likes YOU not him. Tbh it’s not his decision to say if you two should talk."
Flirting,fn6yhlp,t3_fztiod,1586709819.0,"yes, she probably likes you too. i flirt the same way"

depression,fdrt0yg,t3_emrpqy,1578689306.0,"Happy birthday!! Honestly if you want it to be different invite friends over, like make a gc of close people. If you’re not close to anyone join classes or something to meet people. Go to a drawing or acting class there are so many friendly people there."
depression,fcslomw,t3_eikk9a,1577919176.0,"I look at life different. The reason I am alive is because I was the fastest swimmer. Jk but actually the reason I get out of bed every day is to change someone’s life. To make someone proud. To meet new people and to inspire change in someone. Everyone has changed someone for the better or worse. Make sure it’s the right thing. 

Also if you wanna get lost in life if you think about it we are just a brain telling everything in our body to do something. We are all particles running into other particles. Lowkey trippy."
depression,fcqz37d,t3_ei9s4u,1577894366.0,"I’d rather be alone and in bed happy than forcing myself to be around people who don’t give a damn about me. Who cares about other people. If you feel sad that you’re at home, go out. If you are perfectly happy being in bed, stay there. Who’s in the right to judge you for being you? I sure as hell am not and no one else is either."

depression,fckwynh,t3_ehl4ep,1577734977.0,"I know how you feel. I don’t know if you just don’t like your job or if you just lost the love of your job but work towards something. Set a goal, for example making enough to go to a concert, to have a spa day, go on vacation. Then you have something to look forward to and be excited for. I am so proud of you that you got out of bed this morning. I know it’s hard but you got this!"

depression,fciir10,t1_fcii3qn,1577663227.0,"Thank you. I’m the best in my league too based off of stats. I’m also on a national team and I’m 6th in the country currently so I’ve gotten used to criticism over the years there are times when it hurts. Good luck to your boyfriend, and I will try to be the best I can. thank you for the support. Wish you the best!!  <3"

depression,fcigf60,t1_fci9sbj,1577662145.0,"Don’t thank me, thank yourself for being strong enough in this shitty world to speak up about how you feel."
depression,fcig9o2,t1_fci96iz,1577662078.0,Omg I love you kind stranger. You put that in another perspective for me I wish you the best! <3
depression,fchtxyc,t3_eh9up7,1577654098.0,Don’t do it. There are so many people who should hate themselves if you did. Get out of bed for me. Little steps at a time. I love you so much and I don’t know you but I do know you made someone who was too scared to say anything feel like they can relate to someone. That they aren’t the only one in the world. So thank you. There is someone you haven’t met yet who is going to need you. Be there for them.
depression,fchtfcd,t3_eh2g5i,1577653917.0,I disagree. You mean the world to someone and you don’t realize it. I am so happy you are alive. Without you. The world would be different. Imagine all the people that could have been something great and changed the world but died. We will never know and neither will you. Do you wanna sit back and be depressed for life or do you wanna go out and change the world. You will change one persons world and someone will for you too.
depression,fchspxq,t3_egzqgq,1577653692.0,It’s completely ok. I went through an eating disorder alone not the same thing but I know the shame of relapsing. I was told from someone I cared about “you over react so much deal with your shit alone I don’t care enough to help you. “ he was someone I loved and cared about. I think about it a lot and it’s completely ok. You went 3 FUCKING MONTHS. Go you! I know it’s hard after having that addiction to stop but it gets better. Find something else when you’re sad. Play video games. Write. Draw. Daydream. That will become your new addiction and cutting won’t be the go to in your mind. I love you and I hope it gets better for you. We can do this together!<3 :)
depression,fchri9n,t3_eh6o7b,1577653331.0,Bro you and I could be online friends. Idk your age or anything about you so I can’t judge you and I don’t have anyone to talk to. Feel free to hmu. <3

Skincare_Addiction,f7lsvg7,t3_dwsjuv,1573847483.0,"This may not be the best advice but if you’re really insecure about your height there are things called shoe inserts you could try to make yourself taller. There is a video on buzzfeed about it. Love yourself man honestly as a girl I don’t care about height and no one really cares about it. You deserve someone who loves you for you, not about height."
Advice,ew8c3su,t3_cn53gf,1565207357.0,My condolences. Have a big internet hug from me. We’re just strangers remember she’s probably looking down on you (from heaven) and is protecting you. Sending all my love your way❤️

relationships,evr7gm1,t3_ckopzk,1564702762.0,Honestly get tinder yourself. See a relationship therapist. Take a break (or break up) you do not deserve to be treated this way. His mistakes will lead to you leaving. His loss not yours.
Advice,evr40i4,t1_evr2od4,1564701349.0,Ok thank you I agree. I am so confused it’s nice to hear someone else’s opinion. When he said he like me I said “don’t worry you’ll stop soon. Why do you like me” them gave me some bs excuse about how I was nice and we both loved the same sport and I was funny. (I recently posted new insta posts at museums. I was wearing a romper and looked skinnier (lost my muscle mass from summer swimming) and then he hit me up.
Advice,evr24jy,t1_evr1snu,1564700543.0,Thanks so much. I’m going to see what people say. If it changes anything we were on FaceTime and he was playing nhl 19 the whole time. He was listening cuz he remembered everything but idk. I’m so lost.
