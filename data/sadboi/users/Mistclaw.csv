u_Mistclaw,fohsnzj,t3_g7j415,1587771877.0,"Final batch of Humanized Colossi for a little bit. The other two will come sometime in the future.

&#x200B;

Basaran is almost the stereotypical war veteran. He's got numerous scars from his various battles throughout the ages. He is one of the older colossi, though not nearly as old as Barba or Malus. Basaran is kinda a no nonsense guy and tells it like it is. He's kinda a jerk at times because of his bluntness, he's also not one to apologize for much. He has a soft spot for Dirge though and thinks of her almost as a daughter. When you get to know him better he's a really nice guy, he just wants to seem like the manliest man that there is.

Dirge is one of the younger colossi, but she doesn't socialize much with the other young colossi. She has a troubled past of abuse and abandonment, so she tends to keep to herself. She barely sleeps because of her night terrors and is will sometimes have mental breakdowns from her PTSD. Dirge is very mentally sensitive, she gets triggered easily and all the other colossi are very kind to her. She loves Basaran and Cenobia, seeing them as the father and brother she once had and lost. Sometimes she's able to make her way out of her lair and will talk to Phalanx since they have some of the same interests. Dirge is a sweet girl, she's just very damaged.

Cenobia is Celosia's biological sibling, the only pair in the Forbidden Lands. Cenobia is much calmer than his sister, though he will go into fits of rage if her or Dirge is being made fun of. His torn ear and neck scar are from a situation where he fought off a group of men that were trying to abuse Dirge. She is forever grateful for Cenobia and the two of them share a special bond. He tends to hang around Avion and Kuromori, but he also loves to spend time with his sisters, seeing Dirge as a member of the family. He sometimes gets teased for being a girly man because of it but Cenobia has tough skin and brushes them off. All in all, Cenobia is that older brother you wish you had that would fight off bullies and support you in any way.

&#x200B;

Yay, now only Argus and Malus left. Though they'll probably come later on as I'm more focused on other things at the moment. I just really wanted to throw these guys out there and give them the spotlight. Hope you like them! ♥"
u_Mistclaw,foep10y,t1_foenjg6,1587710017.0,"That he is lol. I feel like he'd also dye his mohawk different colors depending on his mood. His favorite hair color is a fiery red with some hints of orange, kinda like the color on his colossus forms back :3"
u_Mistclaw,fodc5tm,t3_g6wsj8,1587682833.0,"More Human Colossi! :3

&#x200B;

Valus kinda reminds me of the backpacking hipster who probably would complain about your taste in music, even if he likes that type of music. Not to say he's an asshole, he just likes to seem like he's always right. He's stubborn but has a good heart, going out of his way to help others that need it. He has a pet hawk that normally tags along on most of his adventures.

Kuromori is the heavy metal/punk of the group. He's a prankster and always trying to find ways to be mischievous. He's best friends with Avion, the two of them hanging out a lot and constantly trying to one up each others stories. Unlike Avion though Kuromori isn't really into flirting. He's more asexual if anything, in truth he just doesn't care about romance. He just kinda wants to stay in his arena and listen to some Fallout Boy or MCR.

Barba is the second oldest of the bunch, right behind Malus. He's your stereotypical old, nostalgic, man. He likes reminiscing about the gold ol' days and telling his old ""war"" stories. He's chill and always there with advice for the younger colossi. He was an old warrior and is very skilled in combat, though he doesn't practice often anymore because of his aching joints (which he will always complain about to anyone or anything that is willing to listen). All and all he's like everyone's grandpa and is always happy to talk things out with the other colossi.

&#x200B;

I'll most likely be uploading Basaran, Dirge, and Cenobia tomorrow. Then Argus and Malus sometime in the future. If I get the time I'll give them outfits and full references, but at the moment I'm too busy with my Fanfiction to really work on them. \^\^;"

It's weird though because now I can't see a world with them around, like I've come to terms that their life ended in that year. I wish they were here almost every day but the horrible grief is gone, I still feel sad when I think about them though.

But yeah, I think it's something that never truly goes away. One day you'll just be doing something completely random and you'll think about an old conversation you had years back. In a way it keeps them alive in our hearts and memories. I like to believe that there is a place for us after death, that makes it a little easier to process.
