You are BEAUTIFUL and IMPORTANT, never listen to what they say. They may have given you your life but they have no rights to choose what makes you happy."
depression,erx3a6i,t3_c2fuf3,1561369717.0,This is so true. Except the reason I cant be depressed in front of them is because they have been the BEST parents I can ever ask for. I feel like telling them or showing them my issues will make them miserable and make them feel as if they have failed in raising me.
