wisdomteeth,fr3hevt,t3_gm6how,1589857473.0,I had 4 removed. No swelling for me. Ppls body react differently I think.
wisdomteeth,fptbnan,t3_gfdhn0,1588888307.0,"Most likely those will only partially grow in. Which will be fine for a bit, but could cause your other molars to move, and every now and then the gums get infected.  It is bearable for a bit, but isn’t worth it. You can get them out when they recommend or wait until they erupt to avoid oral surgeon costs. Dentist pulling teeth is way cheaper. They numbed me up and I spent about 200. You wont regret it once they are out whatever way you go."

Anxiety,flfbmcm,t3_fo6h6w,1585102530.0,"A couple days ago, my chest hurt every time I breathed. Manual breathing occurred. Since then, I’ve gotten off twitter. I feel normal again but the chest anxiety still comes and goes time to time. I guess mine just kind of wore off once I accepted the possible worse consequences of it all. I also lost my job, but you know what? What good is worrying going to do? The hard part is that I even understand that and the chest pains still can come back. You arent alone in your feelings. We got this."
PUBATTLEGROUNDS,fl8htm0,t3_fmxlo5,1584924010.0,Well freaking done bro
wisdomteeth,fkwa8qe,t3_fl2qom,1584587158.0,I waited about 5-7 days until I ate solid solid food again. The pain will go away in about that same span. Small amount of bleeding can last up to 2 days too. No worries. But I’d wait about a week for that burger
wisdomteeth,fkw8o6c,t3_fkql96,1584586067.0,Got my wisdom teeth out because of this. The back of my mouth has never felt better since!
wisdomteeth,fk9xtis,t3_fh5aid,1583986299.0,Keep doing what you are doing. Over time it gets batter. Completely normal.
wisdomteeth,fk2uupz,t3_ffpbtq,1583809719.0,How are people getting this good of a pic in the back of their mouth? Lol
wisdomteeth,fjniwe7,t3_fedqhb,1583508366.0,"I would say trust the professional over blog posts. I do know that if you get a bottom wisdom tooth out, over time, the top tooth will over correct and cause more problems.  So I would say AT LEAST get the top and bottom of the side that is giving you issues. 

But honestly, there’s no huge need to keep all the wisdom teeth. If you are going to go through the process of getting them out, get them all done at once. You dont want to have to go through the recovery again (speaking from experience). I’ve also heard from my dentist it gets much riskier to remove the wisdom teeth after age of 25. So if any problems arrive in the future, often they will just have you deal with it."
wisdomteeth,fjm3jhl,t3_fe6dgm,1583460787.0,Normal. There will be a hole there for a little while. Pain is normal up until day 10-14

wisdomteeth,fj6t9kf,t1_fj6lx1x,1583079679.0,"Yeah. Just keep with pain meds if it gets bad. Or oragel for the gums.  I waited to get teeth out until they were fully grown in through the gums. 2 months of waiting wont cause them to move too much, but you might start feeling the tooth coming through the gum a little."
wisdomteeth,fj6cc0s,t3_fbqr5x,1583066973.0,"You’re good to wait. It might feel uncomfortable, but thats just the the teeth teething."
