The government will also deny children too young for this.  As far as facial surgery, hormones do the majority of the work. After that it is patient preference.

It may not be obvious but throughout the years but they hinted at vegetarianism and even veganism as the status quo on working well supplied ships and stations. When Riker was cooking eggs in his quarters his guests were fascinated but kind of off put at first without articulating if it was also actual eggs that came from animals as well as cooking them yourself that was so unusual. When Keiko and Miles were talking about food from their backgrounds, Keiko was surprised and a bit shocked that his mother used real meat. That is the most immediate references that come to mind."
