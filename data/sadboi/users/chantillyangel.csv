Obviously friends are important but losing a bit of your wife's trust just so your friends don't bully you is stupid. You're building a life with this woman therefore she should be more important.

Personally I wouldn't stop my partner from going to a strip club but if she's expressed a disliking then it's his choice and he's chose to respect her because he clearly loves her and doesn't want to make her unhappy. 

For example if someone tells my partner something about my friends and he tells me not to tell anyone as it'll get him in trouble I'd rather keep that secret from my friend regardless of how much it hurts them because I'd rather risk losing my friend that my partner.
It's not toxic at all 😂

Anyway about the meme, you're deffo overreacting about it, like I get it sometimes you feel crappier and uglier than usual and sometimes a meme like that can really affect you. But that's YOUR problem not his. This is YOUR body confidence issue not his.

medicine,fabycps,t1_fabsz3u,1575930721.0,"I mean as a logical person I can see what you're saying. But being in the situations I've been in and the state of my mental health I can see it from a different perspective. By saying that ""we took different anatomy classes point to wear it hurts"" it's like you're implying that the patient is dumb. You don't intend it that way but just the beggining of that statement is what makes it seem condesending. Like I get you mean you've been taught to a level some people haven't but I just don't think it's necessary to point it out and to some will even look like you're looking down on their education compared to yours.
Just using ""can you show me where it hurts"" or using the printable sheets that ask you to circle/shade where it hurts are a more appropriate way of producing the same results."

medicine,fabmhbp,t1_faaqnxg,1575925455.0,"I also found what you said very condesending. I've had plenty of doctors that have said stuff and made me feel so much worse and this would be a phrase that would make me feel worse.
You feel self conscious? What about the many people you say that to, they probably go home thinking their doctor finds them stupid."
depression,fablspr,t3_e8anzg,1575925155.0,"This relates to alot of people, I'm 24 and I haven't experienced most things people of my age have. I don't just have depression though I have chronic illnesses etc.
It's hard seeing people, even my best friend, moving on with their lives and me just being stuck. In the same place. Constantly. No way to move on because I physically and mentally can't."
