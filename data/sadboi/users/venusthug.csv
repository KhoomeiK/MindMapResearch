My experience is probably a little different because that movie is actually the first SATC thing I ever saw, as a teenager. I knew it was cheesy, but it still got me interested in the series. Last night after seeing this post I got the urge to watch it again, having done so not too long ago with both movies. I liked it more than previously. I think the ""I am woman"" scene is great, one of the best in the movie, and last night I also enjoyed all of them dancing to Liza Minelli's ""Single ladies"" performance. So they went a little crazy, indulged themselves with the movie. I don't know, to me there's something very enjoyable, a warmth to it. I still love the women, the friendship. It's like good junk food, as a lot of movies are."

I recommend NewYorker for clothes. It's rather cheap, at least for Estonia, but sells quite stylish stuff - at least for women. There's one in the centre, at a department store called Postimaja, and also in Kristiine Centre for example.
