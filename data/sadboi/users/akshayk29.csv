depression,fpselfh,t3_g9ndgw,1588872161.0,For me it happened when it was 5 months into my degree. At that time I was 18. I had tried hard to shed my old underconfident self and to connect with people around me. Just one rejection along with the understanding that I hate my degree and not understanding what to do as well as global warming just took the energy out of me. When I somewhat recovered another rejection came and there I went down again. This time coronavirus took me down. Every time I try to stand something leaves me stumbling. But after that first rejection things have never been okay.
