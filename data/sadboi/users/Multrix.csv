Alot more of course but those are the coolest options imo. But with those fish you can also have corals with only needing to add a light and maybe some more flow. For me personally FOWLR would be interesting for keeping fish that are not reef safe like angelfish, triggerfish and butterfly fish. Not trying to talk you out of it don't get me wrong. Of course you can also only keep a pair of clowns, add some bangai cardinals like a month later and if you get bored of it after a while just up your flow, add lights eventually and you can keep corals."

ReefTank,flg033d,t1_flecc0l,1585124807.0,"Well imo a 5g tank is not suitable for any fish as i've already said. But you can still make it look awesome. If you want a reef tank (a saltwater tank with corals) you'll need a different light, something that generates flow and a heater. That's like the most basic stuff you'll need. The filtration will be done biologically by your life rock and life sand. Best option would be to get both things already cycled from either another hobbyist or an LFS. For lights you can go with the Kessil A80, AI Prime or cheaper options with a spectrum suitable for corals the two mentioned are just the best imo. You might want to read up on things because there's a lot to know. Also chat up your LFS guy to get some knowledge."
ReefTank,fle9tnc,t3_fnpzqp,1585080279.0,"What did you buy it for? In a 5g marine tank you can't really keep fish. Like one very small one max. And with those lights corals won't survive because of the spectrum. They need 15000-20000k

When they sit on your glass or rock all the time they're the good ones, sitting on your coral may be the bad ones but also may be just passing by. Just a coin flip really in my opinion.

Edit: I am using one 270g/h powerhead and my euphyllia only fully opens up when it's been off for a while. Don't know if relocating it would work as it already is in a rather low flow area. Should I rather go for 2 small powerheads?"

If everything else in your tank's doing great and just one coral is slacking it's usually a placement issue. In my experience atleast. Might also be a parasite that is specific to this coral.

I pulled everything up to make it more bright and took out a lot of whites. I only have like 4-5h of whites because I have a lot of softies and as far as I know softies don't like too much whites and my LPS and SPS are placed high enough for them to still get enough light."
