Edmonton,fprvhv0,t1_fpiwqef,1588862831.0,Came here to say this. Was my third time buying a house and he was the best mortgage broker I‚Äôve ever dealt with.
BPDmemes,fn0o029,t3_fyi8xt,1586545472.0,"Thank god I‚Äôm not the only one! I have a friend that does this alllllllllll the time. I will always ask first if I want to bring somebody else, should never just spring that on somebody."
Edmonton,fl7zej2,t3_fn7e1s,1584912643.0,"Walmart on 127 st had toilet paper this morning, a decent amount of it too. Didn‚Äôt check for Lysol wipes though. They were limiting one per customer so you could probably still get lucky."
Edmonton,fkt1f3l,t3_fkhg2g,1584503597.0,Karen Lemke is a pretty great psychologist and downtown in the same building as the family centre.
BPDmemes,fjxt2nu,t3_ff3mof,1583682692.0,"This is a little too real for me. Also, super glad pengu is making into memes."
BPD,fiqmgbs,t3_f9ch7m,1582647443.0,Yes! This happens to me a lot. I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt really have any helpful advice on the topic. I usually try to remove myself from whatever is causing the negative reaction (leave the room even if it‚Äôs just a few minutes to try and compose myself or leave entirely if possible) or put my headphones in and crank up some music.

BPD,fg528z4,t3_ewubca,1580516499.0,"I don‚Äôt love them or hate them, I‚Äôm at the point where I accept that they‚Äôre just kind of there. I don‚Äôt sh anymore, and I don‚Äôt go out of my way to hide them anymore either (can I get an amen for not wearing long sleeves in the middle of summer?). That being said, I slather on the sunblock in the warmer months because I find a good tan makes the ones that have really faded stand out more and that makes me uncomfortable."
BPD,ffu0b1u,t3_ev5upy,1580231699.0,"Thank you for putting cohesive words to some of my own thoughts. What really hit me is where you said nowhere feels like home. More often than I‚Äôd like to admit I find myself thinking ‚ÄúI just want to go home‚Äù even if I‚Äôm already at home, I never thought that might be associated with identity instability. Thank you so much for sharing <3"
BPD,ffk1g0o,t3_etzigg,1580012886.0,I once saw it described as like being an emotional burn victim. Because our emotional skin is so fragile we feel thinks in a significantly more intense way.

BPD,fenjx6i,t3_eq31er,1579286289.0,"One of my good friends has BPD and it‚Äôs actually been one of the best relationships I‚Äôve had. We‚Äôre both actively in therapy so we focus more on supporting and encouraging each other in a positive way than anything else. I do have another friend that definitely presents with BPD symptoms that isn‚Äôt in any kind of treatment and that relation is a bit more... turbulent. 

I think it largely depends on the person and where they‚Äôre at treatment wise. It‚Äôs really nice to be able to talk to somebody that understands the nuances of your experience without feeling like you‚Äôre crazy."

BPD,f4wj4ol,t1_ewhrj8o,1571856632.0,"So much this!! I had a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù that severed all ties because she felt like she was always the one reaching out. (Truthfully, she wasn‚Äôt that good of a friend anyways but it still hurt)"
