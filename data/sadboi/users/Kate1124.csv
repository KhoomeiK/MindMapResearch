cycling,fqnh1e8,t3_gjlnyv,1589494706.0,"Female here - also hugely into cycling and then became a triathlete which meant even more of a time commitment. I’m also a physician, I practice at least 2 hours of yoga/ashtanga/inversions daily or at least 6 days per week, I live in the PNW so I ride whether it rains or not otherwise I would never ride. I have a really active social life and have time to spend with my friends, I have a partner that I love and who doesn’t feel neglected or anything like that because of all of the very strong pulls that compete for my time. Like others have said, I don’t think this is a cycling issue, I think there’s likely been underlying deeper stuff going on that kept building up and not being addressed. If you think back to before cycling became the “thing that’s doing it”, what was your marriage like? How did you feel? 
It may also be worth it to evaluate your interpretation of the situation. He says okay bye I’m going cycling - do you think stuff like “oh there he is leaving me again bc he doesn’t care and I’m not worth it and blah blah”? I know you said he said no to therapy, but perhaps therapy for you would be a good idea, so at least you are able to get clarity and make decisions that you can live with."

It was a bad time too because it was right before I was starting residency and he was working full time, which meant that the dog would spend at least 10 hours in a crate. We were about to move into a smaller apartment, I had cats who didn’t like dogs, and it was the absolute worst. It put so much extra strain into our already-strained relationship, and I resented him daily. 
We didn’t make it, of course. It wasn’t the dog, but the dog didn’t help. 
I empathize deeply with your situation and I just wanted to validate that I would be feeling just as lost and frustrated as you are, especially because this also involves your child. I think your feelings are super valid, and perhaps this might be a good teaching opportunity for you to have with your daughter in terms of why we need to be mindful of our decisions and things of how things will affect us long-term, and how sometimes we don’t get everything we want, but we can still create a life worth living nonetheless.

This is a firm boundary, I am not open to discussing my boundary further because it will not change.” 

Boundaries are healthy and appropriate. Consent is freely and enthusiastically given — if you’re consenting because when you say no he sulks and acts out, you’re being punished for saying no and you’re not actually being given the choice to say yes or no. His feelings are not your responsibility. He can be disappointed. It’s okay. People get disappointed all the time. He is free to make requests. You’re free to accept or decline any of them. He is free to then choose what he wants to do for himself without pushing your boundaries. (“She doesn’t want anal but I do so I can accept that and work through things to find other ways to make our sex life feel good for me, or I can decide that this is just a nonnegotiable for me and I need to find another partner that is more compatible with me.”)

As soon as I’m out of clinic and in my car I burst into tears because I’m so angry and I feel so powerless and I am so scared that I’m gonna see my colleagues die or that I’m gonna get my partner sick or that I’m gonna get really sick and die. We had a confirmed case that I was in contact with recently and today I slept through my alarm and went to work and halfway through the morning I started feeling cruddy and I checked my temp and it was 99.7 so I emailed my med director and our scheduler and told them I have mild symptoms and my scheduled patients are phone visits for the rest of the day so I’m going home because I want to protect the people I work with and my patients and I’ll work from home since I have all the tools I need. He emailed me back and said that if I’m too sick to be at work Then I’m too sick to work and I am not to enter any work hours into my timecard for the rest of the day. I asked him if he wanted me to come back and keep working until my temp reached 100.4 or if he wanted me to actually model the socially responsible and ethical  behaviour that we want people to follow.

Eugene,fkycqy5,t1_fkxnqqn,1584646148.0,"If you’re healthy, wearing a regular mask is not really going to help you prevent infection. Surgical masks can’t prevent the inhalation of small airborne particles - they function as a physical barrier, meaning that if you’re sick and for some reason need to be out in public (but you should stay home) then you should wear a mask because it’s designed to trap larger particles from body fluids that contain virus/bacteria, but won’t completely eliminate risk. 

So no, don’t wear masks in public unless you’re ill and must be outside.  Healthy people wearing or hoarding masks is just going to extend our already limited resources further without any added benefit."

I think doing what you can to protect yourself/your child and others with the data we have available right now just means you’re a good parent and that you want to do your part to model wise behaviour to give our healthcare infrastructure a solid chance. I don’t think that makes you a psycho. Furthermore — my personal philosophy after so many years in pediatric medicine has never to date failed me, and I tell my worried moms and dads this all the time: *you* know your child best. If you have a gut feeling that something isn’t right with them but you can’t explain why, don’t talk yourself out of it. I would 100% rather see you and tell you that your kid is fine and have a conversation about what we need to be on the lookout for, than getting a dreaded phone call telling me I need to go sign a death certificate or that one or my patients got too sick but mom felt silly and like she was burdening me and talked herself out of that gut feeling. 

Do what you need to do to help normalize your and your child’s environment in this time of unprecedented uncertainty; while still being mindful and wise about the needs of others (meaning, don’t go nuts and buy 100 eggs and 10 cases of toilet paper.) 

Hope this helps. Big hug to you"
Eugene,fkwkqpo,t3_fl0me8,1584595550.0,"Sorry I totally get that the idea behind this is good but you started by saying wave to each other from our homes but then you said you congregated around someone’s house.
Please understand that social distancing is important AF and that we’re discouraging folks from mixing households and such. 6 ft away is recommended as a risk lowering measure for ESSENTIAL functions — like when I’m in my office with a bunch of my nurses trying to reschedule all my healthy patients or moving to phone visits because they don’t need to be coming into my clinic at this time. 
I understand that social isolation is difficult and challenging but please understand the severity of this and the importance of flatting the curve by slowing down the rate of spread of disease. We are working 100+ hours per week and running so low on supplies that they’ve literally locked our PPE and we (healthcare personnel) are constantly underprotected and overexposed. PLEASE help us and the communities we love and serve by doing your part and adhering to recommended guidelines. If you can stay home, stay home. I can’t stay home — I have the privilege of being trusted to care for your families and (especially) your children, and I don’t want to see us falling into the depths of despair. 

You can help. Do your part. Spread the word. And stay home, please. 

Sincerely and with lots of love — from your neighborhood pediatrician."

We don’t have enough longitudinal data to make blanket statements like that, but more and more info becomes available as time goes by. Definitely talk to his pediatrician but as a general rule I would be extra diligent about adhering to his asthma plan — don’t skip controller meds, be aware of triggers, use albuterol as indicated for exacerbations, and continue practicing and advocating for social distancing and the many other measures recommended to slow down spread of illness."
Eugene,fkwguba,t1_fkwebox,1584592104.0,"I appreciate that! :-) Happy to serve my community. 

I also don’t normally have an allergy problem but I’m also in the midst of triathlon training season and definitely on the struggle bus."
Eugene,fkw7e0y,t1_fktd2r0,1584585187.0,I meant to come back to this but got busy in the craziness that is medicine right now and forgot. Just saw [this](https://kval.com/news/local/tree-pollen-count-in-eugene-rockets-to-very-high-levels)  and it reminded me of this comment. I’ll come back w longer explanation— thanks for the question
IAmA,fkw5em4,t1_fku3wmd,1584583858.0,"I’m sorry - pediatrician here — just hijacking this comment to say there’s an article in the journal of pediatrics that just came out and looked at epidemiological data in the pediatric population — I can fetch you a copy if you have trouble finding the link. Takeaways — we’ve seen children who actually show symptoms though these differ from the adult population. Some children are still at risk of significant morbidity and mortality — particularly infants. One child (14yo) died after contracting virus though details on this case are limited. Children are absolutely able to have minimal to no symptoms w virus and pass it on to others. My theory is that their role in the spread of this disease is greater than we anticipate, but eventually the data will reflect this association."

Source again: y’all need to take your second generation antihistamines (Zyrtec Claritin) for a bit before they kick in so start now 
Also: it’s gonna be a bad allergy season"

mildlyinfuriating,fklkzs0,t1_fkk7e9s,1584308801.0,"I’m a pediatrician and this is horrible advice but I appreciate the disclaimer. 
For the record, we never recommend cold medicine for children. Cough is a protective mechanism. You don’t want secretions to stay stagnant because that’s how you develop pneumonia or secondary complications. 
The best thing you can do for your baby is suction their nose w saline frequently, run a humidifier at night, make sure they’re hydrated... supportive care mostly. Cold meds aren’t safe for kids, as a general rule."
