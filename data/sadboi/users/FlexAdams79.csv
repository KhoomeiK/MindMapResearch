askcarsales,flviqaz,t3_fr8eh5,1585524686.0,I’ve had a ton of anxiety this year not due to the virus so being “laid off” has been what I needed since we were slow at work anyway.  I’m not sure if I should get unemployment or take the FMLA deal?  Anyone else in the same boat?

I wake up every day thinking my breathing will be off and it sure is!  Negative thoughts I guess.
I thought I had a virus for 2 months because of the throat congestion ( was told I have acid reflux but pills don’t change it  from what I can tell.)
Problem is that I have so many things going on that it’s like the chicken or the egg, what’s causing what?  
I basically meditate and go for walks, bike ride, etc..."

For those that have breathing issues associated to anxiety, is it an all day every day thing like mine??  Also, I get a  lump in my throat (congestion ) along with an upset stomach throughout the day.  My anxiety was brought on by bring sick for all of January and into February"
