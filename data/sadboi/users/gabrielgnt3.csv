If it helps you, it's great, but if it doesn't, it'll ruin your trip and you'll likely have a bad comedown. Drugs aren't the solution but they're fun so be carefull and have fun and good luck with your PTSD"

When my little first came around, she couldn't talk or look people in the eyes and was scared of my therapist. Now she's a little ball of joy so she cheers me up everytime she comes around.

DID,fqrahfv,t3_gkaz2y,1589580626.0,"One of my protectors was my persecutor. She incarnated my anger and she still does when I really need it like an emergency
But she went dormant after going through some hard things and I kept trying reaching to her and everytime she fronted, it was for us and she was like ""I'm tired, no one's there for *me*""
I think sometimes we can't help them and they have to make their own journey. It's so difficult being a protector from what I heard from her and from the protectors of this sub.
I told her that we were there for her, and I keep trying to make things easier for her and that implies getting my shit together and trying to be ok and leaving her some space.
I hope it will be ok for both of you, take care"
adultsurvivors,fq698ix,t3_gh33st,1589127046.0,"I know what you're feeling, I had severe panic attacks whenever I did sex. I couldn't even have an orgasm even when I was on my own. I started having flashbacks and I know they'll keep coming.
But the panic attacks stopped. I started having orgasms and pleasure again. It takes work and having a partner that you can trust is very very helpful. It's very difficult and confusing but with time and work, you'll get through this. Just take your time, don't push yourself, don't force yourself, don't feel guilty about it. It's okay.
Repressed memories are bad, sex is already overwhelming itself so take it easy and you'll reappropriate your body and your sexuality. They're yours to experience

ptsd,fmhlf77,t3_fvbn88,1586085036.0,"I'm almost in the same situation. When my parents got a divorce, my father used to go in my bed, drunk, and hold me and cry until he fell asleep, saying that if I wasn't here he'd kill himself, that he won't live for long. Other things happened and when I tried to talk to him about it, he'd act like nothing happened. But he's a great person too ! He always got my back

Lately, I had a lot of flashbacks and decided it was time to face him. I wrote him a letter where I say everything that happened that I can remember. I told him that it wasn't to make him feel guilty or ashamed but to move on, for the both of us. He called me and we finally talked about. He asked for my forgiveness, whenever I'd feel it

There is hope. And those things are over now. We're not responsible for our parents. You're neither guilty, neither responsable, neither nothing. Either the relationship is good and peacefull, either there shouldn't be one.
If he doesn't listen to you, or aknowledge the issue, it's his loss. You're so caring, but sometimes we can't do anything. It's doesn't mean that nothing will ever change. But it might take a while. But it's ok

I'm Always scared that I'll have a phonecall saying my father killed himself. It's a fear I'm afraid will never end. I have nightmares sometimes. But I know that it's ok. And he knows it's ok too. I'm in therapy and doing good because what matters is here and now. I forgive him because it's over now. I understand what happened. But we're not obliged to forgive them. It's not our duty to be the most responsible one, the more mature one. Things take time

I Hope it will be ok for you and that my answer makes sense ^^'"

She would hide and stay still too but now, she loves to talk, to draw, to dance, to play, to laugh. Because healing myself and my childhood was also healing her. Showing her that we can do it and that we were powerful together helped her a lot.

And the second situation is my little's bestfriend was my bf and she loved play with but for some reason, she began to hate him and told him he wasn't his friend anymore. I communicate with her too, asking if there was something I could do for her to feel better, if she wanted me to help their relationship and she decided to take some time off.

I do think that it can be quite difficult seeing those systems being so strong and diverse when we don't ( even though their work is great ). I also can't see things in my head like imaging an apple. I also don't have an inner Wolrd but it's like I was feeling my alters in my head. Sometimes, they're very close to my head and switches can happen, sometimes they're far and I don't hear from them for a long time.
DID is very complex, but I think it's okay if we're not. It's already difficult. We're valid, even if we have less alters, or no inner wolrd."
