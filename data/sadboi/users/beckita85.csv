nightwish,fhydfhi,t3_f57i1b,1581973674.0,Is anyone having trouble with the pre-sale code? I saw in the comments it’s HUMANNATURE but whenever I type it in it says the code is incorrect. I’m trying to get tickets for the LA show.
nightwish,fhyd86z,t1_fhxunln,1581973555.0,I keep typing in this code for the LA shows and it says it’s incorrect!
MrRobot,ffpt6pj,t1_ffpsywg,1580104792.0,I didn’t realize that! I’ve noticed that a lot of times but not every time. I’m going to definitely keep a much closer eye on it.
MrRobot,fcs1lvp,t3_eii8xl,1577910036.0,"I started rewatching with my friend last night, who’s never seen it. She’s constantly like “what the fuck is happening?!” And “this is fucking great.” 

She’s also been asking me if I’ve noticed anything on this rewatch since all I’ve told her is that the ending of the show rewrites the whole thing. I’m like, “SO MUCH!”

After the bit where Qwerty talks to Elliot in the withdrawal sequence I said “There was SO much there OMG!” And she said, “Are you kidding me? From THAT? What show is this?!”

This is so fun."
MrRobot,fbhle7p,t1_fbg44wq,1576876438.0,Thank you!!
MrRobot,fbhldr7,t1_fbg2tzj,1576876429.0,That’s still really good to know! Thank you!
MrRobot,fbftjex,t1_fbft814,1576820513.0,Noted
MrRobot,fai0rsk,t3_e93mwo,1576097478.0,This all makes so much sense. Thank you!!
MrRobot,f9m320w,t1_f9m03ra,1575439733.0,Oh god I’ll be so mad if all this led up to some version of “and it was all a dream.”
MrRobot,f93awld,t3_e3ir02,1575054336.0,All of them.
MrRobot,f923ggs,t1_f91ywir,1575010928.0,"Ah, gotcha. That flashback then. Thanks."
MrRobot,f91xblx,t3_e3a1fq,1575004364.0,"In a flashback late in the third season, we see Darlene show up to visit Elliot right after she got back in town. He tells her that coworkers locked him in a control room or computer room or something like that over a weekend. He blacked out and the next thing he knew the whole place was smashed up. He didn’t remember doing it but that’s when he got court-mandated therapy for anger management."
MrRobot,f8tmc2d,t3_e23kyo,1574806450.0,"I’ve thought a lot about this too. Someone in this sub posted that he was initially making progress in therapy and perhaps got too close to realizing he was abused. Krista mentioned in the pilot that he was regressing, so maybe that means Mr. Robot was coming back (or was already back). 

There’s another scene later (I forget when) when Mr. Robot says something along the lines of “they’ll make you take pills and make me disappear”. Something like that. 

There’s also the scene in S1 (ep 9?) when Darlene realizes Elliot doesn’t recognize her. She tells Angela that it’s happened again but this is the worst it’s been. 

I think Mr. Robot has taken times to suppress Elliot’s memories either to protect him (no hat) or to take over and carry out his own agenda (hat). 

I really hope we get an episode or part of one that flashes back to times that Elliot has suppressed in a way that blows our minds and makes everything clear. 

I also really hope he starts talking to us again."
MrRobot,f8tl2pq,t1_f8tkhg3,1574805641.0,"A lot of victims blame themselves about their abuse. He’s only just found out and hasn’t processed a single thing. So, of course he’s finding a way to blame himself. He needs more than an hour before he can start to process and eventually (hopefully) gain a healthy acceptance of what happened to him."
HydroHomies,f8324f8,t3_dygh8z,1574202755.0,I’m a middle school teacher and I say this to every student for every tiny thing they complain about.
bipolar,f4yh4nk,t1_f4xg5j1,1571876496.0,Same all around! Except for me it’s a latte. 😊
bipolar,f4wykwy,t3_dm0bnp,1571860888.0,"For me Mr. Robot. I felt like I could really relate to Elliot in that I sometimes feel socially isolated, have addictive tendencies, and sometimes feel theres two distinctive parts of my personality. I also love Six Fert Under. I’ve watched the series probably 6 or 7 times. There’s darkness and beauty and humor and you can find yourself in each character. It’s one of the best character-driven shows I’ve ever seen."
bipolar,evwcqto,t1_evufvfl,1564860829.0,Thanks for such a great explanation! I was only diagnosed a year and a half ago so I’m still sort of learning all of this.
bipolar,eue3mi3,t3_cfz55z,1563734471.0,"I definitely feel that. I’m very fortunate I to teach middle school, which I love. I’ve been stable on my meds without a bad episode for a year. I see a therapist weekly and check in my with psychiatrist every two months. Of course, bipolar isn’t curable and I still have the ups and downs, just at a lesser degree. Sometimes it can make work difficult in that I’ll talk too fast/go in too many directions for my students to follow or be so exhausted and blah that I have a hard time mustering up any patience or enthusiasm. Faking it is hard but I do my best. 

I rarely tell people because they either don’t believe me or they ask what my symptoms are. I’ll explain about the impulsivity, paranoia, voices, depression and they’ll often say “yeah but that sounds like stuff everyone does”. 

It’s frustrating and isolating to not have people believe you. As we all know, when you’re stable on your meds it often feels likes we DON’T have bipolar. People not taking it seriously or saying those types of comments makes it even harder. 

That’s why I barely tell anyone. Just my teaching partners so they can be aware and sort of keep and eye, closest friends, my parents, and one of my brothers. Even my mom (who’s a therapist) questions my diagnosis and often thinks it’s just anxiety. 

Oh, life."
