The clock you've had to deal with the boredom of it all. The clock of pain. The clock of misery. Finally controlled by your actions. Don't worry about your so called 'loved ones'. Cuz if they loved you truly the feeling wouldn't be so intense. A tip for everyone worried about it. You can make it look like an accident. My perfect idea is definently die at sea choose, the worst conditions and fight a battle of Impossible. My first attempt to kill myself was 9, I'm now 30. It's an unbearable feeling knowing you hate the air you breathe that makes you live. To all people like me, I hope we get the courage to end are misery x"
