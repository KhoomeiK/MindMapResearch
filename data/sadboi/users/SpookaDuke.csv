notliketheothergirls,fl40kpj,t3_fm8oli,1584803094.0,"I dated this girl. I thought she was great until she tried to hook up with my best friend at a new years party while I was passed out in the next room. Turns out she was also hooking up with her coworker since before we even met. I recommend adding manipulative, narcissistic and the need for constant validation to the list."
Seaofthieves,f9jjp62,t3_e4myr7,1575377072.0,"Spending $20 on Sea of Thieves cosmetics isn't a big deal. You don't have to buy anything if you don't want to. People spend hundreds of dollars on league of legends skins, some are even $20 a pop, and that seems to be perfectly acceptable. The devs shouldn't be discouraged from selling premium items, especially when they've been saying they were going to do it so far ahead of time."

BPD,ezars6s,t3_d081ex,1567806486.0,"Reading through these comments has given me a lot of closure and understanding as someone who was on the other end of this. I felt as though I wasn't enough for her, and obviously crushed when I found out she had fallen for and was sleeping with the guy she told me was just a friend. She has destroyed many friendships this past year because of this infatuation to romantic feelings cycle outlined in this thread. Seeing these comments makes me realize that this kind of behavior sounds sort of inevitable if you're already in the cycle. As heartbroken as I am, I feel bad for her since she wants friends so badly but is responsible for destroying all of her own relationships."

AskReddit,esdb1a4,t3_c71051,1561852174.0,I remember hearing a story during a lecture about a competition where two people had a set amount of time to make the best ceramic art piece. Person A spent a lot of time on their piece being careful not to make any mistakes for a high quality result. Person B created as many ceramic pieces as they could. Person B won the competition because they learned from each piece they made and improved with each iteration.
