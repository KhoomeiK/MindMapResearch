The self criticism and self judgement and missing your old life occasionally but feeling immense guilt for even thinking it. I never knew this was what motherhood could be like. I knew it would be hard but didn’t know there was such insecurity and outside judgements involved. That’s probably partly why mums act so high and mighty.. it’s not right but it’s some weird culture that develops around you almost as soon as you get that line on the stick and it can be hard not to get sucked in. It’s fuarking crazy. Anywho you ARE tired and you have every right to complain like anyone else in the world! Xxxx"

They do have to go to hospital/gp especially if they are immunodeficient. So should we just ban people who are unvaccinated from hospitals?? Or what’s your solution to this?? What about the ones who are just plain allergic to the vaccines?? Should they suffer?! Do they have to live in a bubble because of people who refuse the vaccine because they assume they know better.. than doctors.... because their 2 hours of biased research plus multiple conversations with other people with a similar bias. And the info that gets spread amongst anti vaccine folk we’ll just think about the game of Chinese whispers. (If you don’t know that game It’s basically where a group of people sit in a circle-think at school- and one person thinks of a sentence and whispers it to the person next to them and it goes on that way until it gets to the last person who says it out loud. That game never has the same sentence by the end. Fun game btw). The info that was originally received and what is generally believed and discussed in those groups of people aren’t always one and the same. Things get confused, warped, people add their own biases and assumptions to the point that the facts are no longer true. But they are believed to be true. All medical care from something as simple as a band aid to a risky surgery all come with risks of all levels. Most people can wear a band aid without any reactions. Some can get a little itchy. One child in the world somewhere could end up with anaphylaxis due to the band aid. Would you eschew band aids because you heard 3 stories of this happening out of thousands?? Doctors are not brainwashed. They are doing their job trying to keep their patients well and away from hospital. The vaccines are so well researched that they will have protocols in place to help with treatment of any adverse effects of vaccines. And while I’m here, that study that proved a correlation between vaccines and autism was debunked years ago. Like I said before science is continuously growing and improving. Doctors use the most up to date info to make their decisions/recommendations. Anti vaxxers use whatever data they can find that backs up their view. Regardless of how outdated the info is. It’s like smokers going around saying that smoking is in fact good for you by using the propeganda that was released before we discovered smoking is as dangerous as it is. Saying that big pharma want to sell you the idea that smoking is bad for you so they can sell you products to quit smoking etc. Look medicine is of course a business but they couldn’t run their business if all/ majority of their clientele were dead.... if an anti vaxxer doesn’t believe they work.. what do they do when their children become sick?? Surely not see a brainwashed dumb doctor?!"

So the people who *choose* not to vaccinate are also *choosing* to put other people who can’t *choose* to be vaccinated at risk. I used to be very much “I will vaccinate I believe in it but who am I to judge those that choose not to, and sure karma might teach them a lesson.” Until this fact was argued to me and it hit me, why they are so insistent on everyone who can, being vaccinated. It’s not just a choice. It’s common decency, consideration for your friends, family and peers. You don’t know who is riding the bus, sitting in the gp’s office or in your kids class that can’t have the vaccine and are walking around just unknowingly waiting for you/your unvaccinated kids to just infect them with anything from the flu to a deadly disease because *you* think you know better than the people who spend over 10 years learning their profession (not to mention the continuous learning involved in the medical profession! Science is constantly evolving and improving and medical professionals have to keep up to date!) that these extremely intellectual people are fooled but you (the anti vaxxer) are not?!
