mentalhealth,f91qae4,t1_f8xat6y,1574997938.0,"I'm looking to get out of the job I have right now because it causes a lot of anxiety for me. It's anxiety that I didn't have before walking into it. But I will say this, it has given me so much more strength that I didn't realize I had. Please reach out if you ever want to talk. I'm here for you!"
mentalhealth,f8x76er,t3_e2rkc6,1574910112.0,"I don’t have a panic disorder but I have really bad anxiety that sometimes leads to panic attacks. I’ve had more than my fair share of panic attacks at my call center job. I’m looking into getting help from a psychiatrist myself because I’ve thought about suicide. I had to run to the bathroom at work and call my younger brother to calm myself down at one point about 6 months ago. I don’t think you’re a wimp in the least. In fact, I applaud you for even reaching out with this post in the first place! You’re not a pussy or a wimp for feeling the way you do. Don’t ever forget that! I’m here if you need to talk, okay?"
