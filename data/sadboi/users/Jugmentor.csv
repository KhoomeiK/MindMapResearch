Later on the Quakers founded Pennsylvania and still later the Mormons founded Utah.  A lot of conflict in the United States can be explained in Protestant sectarian terms even among Americans who are atheists.  It's not the religion they cleave to, it's their home region's mentality, which is fundamentally Protestant regardless of official relationship to any religious institution.

The two big political dynasties of recent American history, the Kennedys and the Bushes, reflect that schisming within Protestant mentality with or without institutional religious overtones.  The Clintons are of the same New England stock as the Kennedys while quite a few senior Republican politicians are rooted in the same tradition of ethics and morality as the Bushes.  None of that has really had time to change much over a mere two-plus centuries regardless of how proudly overtly atheist so many Americans are.

A bunch of minor league teams eliminated and that oppressive minor league player agreement--although to be fair to the owners the established players did sell out the minor leaguers big time.  Other signs include what appeared during the 2016 preseason a moratorium on signing established free agents to big contracts.

Torontobluejays,fqrzxhg,t1_fqryytg,1589595498.0,"40-year-old general manager Ian Wright of Oregon is apparently some kind of genius, one of the best in the business.  And that team's version of Cito is a fiery guy named Gary Braudrick.  I can't find either of them through Google so they appear to be imaginary.

The owner is some vanity owner in Florida who kept changing the manager or GM every year until Braudrick won manager of the year in 1985.  This must be the first time he hasn't fired somebody after one bad season.  It makes me think that overly frequent ownership changes and corporate ownership had far more effect on the RL Jays than we might suspect.  Not saying the results would have been better with a long-term Steinbrenner-like vanity owner but the real 1985 team didn't make the world series like my simmed team did.

Some other interesting differences in my sim.  Lloyd Moseby led the league in OPS in one or two seasons and regularly hits 35+ homers while George Bell has been in RF hitting 25 homers a year with Jesse Barfield as his backup.  Dave Stieb was a pinch runner until 1984 and then briefly a closer before joining the rotation in 1985 and having his first good season before having a bad season as starter in 1986.  Jimmy Key was third in Cy Young Voting in 1985 with a 24-8 record as staff ace and the team's first 20-game winner.  A number of other things are different, primarily in terms of the catchers, as the catching prospects the Jays had coming up worked out and therefore we didn't have an Ernie-and-Buck duo as in RL.

David Wells was in AAA for the 1986 season after briefly being up for a couple of years.  The team signed Thad Bosley and Jorge Orta as well as earlier on Doug DeCinces.  It wasn't until the homegrown players began to shine, Key in particular, that they became a really good team."

CanadaCoronavirus,fqplb4n,t1_fqnypgd,1589549036.0,"I don't agree with ascribing intelligence or decision-making to a virus.  It's not capable of caring what is a good or bad outcome for it.  But if it were to mutate that way then it would likely kill its victims too quickly for them to infect ""enough"" other people to sustain virus spread.  That would be completely unintentional as the virus is not capable of forming an intention."
FloridaMan,fqom9s4,t1_fqom6ns,1589518631.0,Thanks for making me aware of that.  I'm only a very casual NFL fan and wasn't aware of that significant difference between the labour agreements.
Torontobluejays,fqom1x7,t3_gk2q9q,1589518475.0,"\- the GM gets fired at the end of that season

\- Phil Roof and Bill Singer retire

\- LA Dodgers win the WS 4 games to 2 over the KC Royals (the fourth team that makes the posteason is the Phillies)

\- some spankin' good hitters on that Jays team in this sim but the pitching was terrible"
CasualConversation,fqoliu0,t3_gk0pwn,1589518096.0,"You do your age group credit, buddy!  That's a very wholesome and responsible way to handle the situation.

As a result of your current relationship with your BF, Isaac is in a way part of a blended family. That poses special challenges but you inspire confidence that the three of you can handle it."
OOTP,fqoizem,t3_gk26gq,1589516328.0,"On the recommendation of OOTP I adjusted some flags downward:

Adjust hitter with fewer than X at bat: down to 150 from 300

Weaken hitters with fewer than X at bat: down to 25 from 50

Adjust pitchers with fewer than X innings: down to 20 from 40

Weaken pitchers with fewer than X innings: down to 5 from 10

&#x200B;

Base potential ratings on: career totals

Base fielding ratings on: imported season

Base pitcher stamina on: imported season

Adjust real L/R splits: yes"
FloridaMan,fqo5gzy,t1_fqnyv1v,1589507962.0,"I'm skeptical that they'll have their contracts voided.  The players union would file a grievance if that happened and union grievance arbitrators ALWAYS reverse a contract voiding, without exception.

As an example NBA player Latrell Sprewell attempted to murder his coach during practice.  His contract was voided by the team but the union filed grievance and arbitrator Shyam Das reinstated Sprewell's contract and reduced the punishment to suspension for the rest of the current season.  Within a couple of years it was totally forgotten that this bastard tried to KILL HIS COACH DURING PRACTICE.  

So I'm not seeing the NFL risk embarrassing itself by voiding these guys' contracts unless they're convicted and sent to prison as Michael Vick and Aaron Hernandez were.  If they are acquitted or the judge fellates them with a suspended sentence they'll be back playing for their teams after a slap on the wrist from the league head office."
OOTP,fqo1j46,t1_fqnpird,1589505670.0,"That surprises me.  It shouldn't be that unbalanced.

Maybe tech support has some ideas."
OOTP,fqnowv7,t1_fqnkwkf,1589498775.0,So do I!  Scouting inaccuracy is part of what makes the game fun.
