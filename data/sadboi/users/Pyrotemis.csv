Aquariums,fq83flq,t3_ghd7r5,1589157707.0,"I have a 45 gallon aquarium with a 20-ish gallon sump underneath. I recently brought home this pleco, who was in really good condition before he entered my tank about a month or so ago. His previous owner couldn't keep up with the water changes,  and since I had a large tank and my roommates knew the owner, we decided to adopt him.

Two weeks ago ish, I found him on the floor outside the tank. I immediately put him back and all seemed well. But now... he looks like this. It's hard to see him because he is always hiding and I have a ripple effect on my tank that hides him pretty well. He had two tankmates (fancy goldfish, which I now realize wasn't the best choice of tankmate at ALL), one of which also decided to commit suicide and jump out of the tank. He didnt make it.

My parameters are:
Ammonia: 0.25ppm
Nitrite: 0
Nitrate: 10ppm
pH: 7.5

I gave them a water change and the ammonia and nitrates were still high. I try to take out 35% of the water but I think I need to take out more because of the sump. I've never had one before... I think it's the water causing so many problems.

I've heard that plecos don't respond well to medicines for fin rot and I'm not sure if that's true or not. I'm just wondering if anyone can give me advice on how to help my fish? Another water change is scheduled for tomorrow after I work."

Anger is also a symptom for me; I feel more out of control during an anxiety attack and if I'm doing something I get frustrated real easy and lose my temper. 

When it's just anxiety and not an attack necessarily, I worry a lot more. This is the stuff like missed phone calls or a weird tone of voice that sets it off and makes me feel real panicky and scared, like I'm about to be evicted or some other life-altering event is happening.

Maybe I spoke to them in the wrong tone or they had to do a chore because I didn't and it frustrated them.

I spent my time off from work in my room being alone, and I felt my roommates were going to get angry with me for not being social enough and just taking advantage of them for electricity or whatever. Right now I hear their voices through the wall and I'm so paranoid that I've fucked up somehow.

This one is my new ranger. Her name is Eclipse in a Jungle Storm (it sounds a bit ridiculous but I like it!) but commonly goes by Toast.

She was very reckless as a kid and liked to get herself into dangerous situations. She was climbing a high tree in a thunderstorm one day, when it was struck by lightning and she fell. She nearly died and wasn't allowed out of her village without supervision from then on, and it earned her the nickname Toast because not only was she hit by lightning and fire, but everyone was convinced she was going to die.

Her clan kept her inside the village for years, bringing her books and trinkets from the outside world for her to study and sate her hunger for adventure. Eventually, this wasn't enough and she convinced them to allow her to learn to hunt and thus become a ranger. Now all she wants is to finally get out of this jungle and explore the world.

I'm probably going to fine tune her backstory, but for now, it works! If anyone has any cool suggestions to add in, I am all ears! I've never been great at coming up with a story."
