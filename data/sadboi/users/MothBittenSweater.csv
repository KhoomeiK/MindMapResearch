funny,ex1gebu,t1_ex1ef3f,1565944001.0,"Can you explain to me how I'm being overreactionary when I'm explaining my justification for the opinion I hold? And, to me - though clearly not to you - it is important. It is a big deal. 

This has become a popular meme, on the top of all. And, easily, someone might see this and think ""yeah, girls are manipulative. Trying to trick us. Girls are the worst"". I mean, we're representing when here as freaking Freddy Krueger - a shorthand for both evil and disgust. But that's a reduction of the issue. I'm not trying to say that manipulation doesn't exist - but that it's not the only contributing factor and that all genders - not just women - are vulnerable to those factors. 

It might be humor, but it plays into a harmful stereotype that's not reflective of what's actually going on and is antagonistic and sexist all in the same breath. 

These articles I'm showing you? They're an indication of my not being insane (as you so kindly accused me of being). They're an indication that body dysmorphia - one of those contributing factor - are leading to filters. And filters - the resultant of female body dysmorphia - are analogous to male body dysmorphia. 

This whole 'girls are liars and manipulators' narrative is highly misogynistic, highly antagonistic, and harmful to not only women but also to both genders."
funny,ex1eaik,t1_ex1diid,1565941375.0,"Men's body dysmorphia tends to center around their musculature while women's heavily focuses on both face and body. Both stem from an innate dissatisfaction with appearance and desire to seem more attractive to potential partners as well as to themselves. It's an analog. Men and women are different and brought up with different social expectations so they exhibit the same psychological ills in different ways. 

Media portrayals of archtypical beauty are harmful to everyone. Not just women. And the reason women are doing isn't only to 'trap you' if it's even to 'trap' at all. It's a deep self dissatisfaction fueled by compounding aesthetic narratives coupled with a desire for human intimacy. 

This kind of reductionist content helps no one.

Also, I can't decide. You're right! That's why it's an open petition and not me walking up to May and telling him to make it happen. (As if I actually could) And I dunno about you, but I've never been in a situation where telling someone to 'suck it up' has actually ever helped."
UCDavis,eqhjp56,t1_eqhijxn,1560061388.0,"if I made the wrong choice, in what capacity was that wrong choice made? In making the petition?

As someone paying their own way through college, I don't have the option or the opportunity to attend a non UC school to avoid a quarter system. 

If you're assuming I'm a deadbeat who can't cope with quarter system academically, I'd like to take a moment to correct that assumption. My grades are just fine. That doesn't negate the fact that the quarter system is harmful. You mention that this is what we signed up for - expectation does not equate it with being acceptable."

We're all struggling, man. It may be in different capacities, but we're all bearing the brunt of something. I mean, just try searching 'depression' in this damn sub. It's a minefield.   


I could give you the cliche schpiel of ""the only reason you're not making friends is that you're not being a friend,"" or ""you'll get friends as soon as you get into clubs,"" but I'm firmly in the camp of that being bullshit. I think it's understandable that you're overwhelmed and feeling isolated when you take into consideration the forced displacement you've undergone due to your parents' demands. It may take some time to move away from that. I think it's important to give yourself some grace to acknowledge and move through the pain your experiencing. You mentioned that you're looking into getting some professional help. I think that's a great idea and a fantastic first move! I have experience with [Acacia counseling](https://www.acaciacw.com/acacia-davis) and they've really helped me acclimatize to my Davis journey. And, oh jeez, it's been a journey.

As you're working through that package, I'd encourage you to adopt a mindset [of no zero days](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). I could totally be wrong, but it sounds like you're coming from an overbearing household. It might be a good time to stretch your autonomy and figure out what it is that you like doing. Friends are great - but great friends come from finding commonalities and that stems from finding things that you enjoy. It's awesome that you're set for money - there aren't going to be very many times in your life where that's going to be the case. It'd be a fantastic idea to use that to your advantage. Now - I'm not suggesting you go on spending sprees. Na, man. Try a painting class, photography, jujitsu - something to get you out in the world and friendly with yourself. Along the way, you'll find a framework of support threaded through those experiences you enjoy. But prioritize your own growth because, no matter what, you take that with you - no one can take that away from you (unless they brainwash you... then I dunno). 

&#x200B;

Keep it up, my dude. You're in a season of life where things can really suck and really hurt and flood you with stressors you didn't even know were possible to have. But if you find tactics of approach that allow you to give yourself grace and the opportunity to grow - you'll get through just fine (even if that fine wasn't the fine you were initially envisioning). I believe in you."
UCDavis,eonk0mt,t1_eongmvb,1558714419.0,"I think you have a good point. Money's needed. Voices need to continue to speak ou. But here's the thing, yeah? Money's been allocated and mismanaged and the need is only growing more dire.   


[Money's been given and then allocated in a way that wasn't agreed upon](https://theaggie.org/2018/02/01/internal-audit-reveals-steep-decline-counselors-250000-worth-questionably-allocated-funds/). Additionally, [18 million dollars for mental health](https://theaggie.org/2018/01/21/reality-counseling-services-uc-system/) was allocated in 2016 (UC wide). As of yet - counseling services still are not meeting the needs of students. And the question of where that money went or to whom it was allocated has yet to be answered. Therapists cite that they've seen few if any of the funds. Those funds are needed in order to bolster retention rates for therapies. 

The issue of [paltry](https://theaggie.org/2018/01/21/reality-counseling-services-uc-system/) [counseling](https://theaggie.org/2018/01/15/difficulties-counseling-services/) offerings has been an ongoing one within the last three years.  Additionally, [reports have shown](http://www.iacsinc.org/staff-to-student-ratios.html) that the need for mental health services only intensifies as years go on. ^((see also: reports linked in the main article)) Students who are able to get counseling sessions are then [exported to](https://www.crisistextline.org/) [services off-campus](https://www.acaciacw.com/acacia-davis). This only further highlights how meager UC Davis' therapy options are and how little of the budget is allocated to something which affects a significant portion of the UC Davis population (students, staff, faculty - all) 

This is how money has been spent in the recent past.
