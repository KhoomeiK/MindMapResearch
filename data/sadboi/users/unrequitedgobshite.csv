Women don't just dump men they love for no reason, as you are all too aware. Many of us find it insulting to be considered ""needy"", especially if 1) you did something (or many things) to make her feel unloved or 2) her habit was prioritizing your needs above hers and this slur was in response to her asking just once for equal priority. 

If this woman has no idea you even still care about her, let alone that you have some idea what broke you up and are willing to take responsibility for fixing the relationship, then why would she give you another chance?"

There was emotional abuse, and I continued hoping that he would ""do better"" or become the social media persona that I fell for, apologising, promising never to do any of it again in a blaze of flattery. It will never happen. He wants porn stars, or at least women who pander to his every whim, so even if he never meets a porn star, he already has a lapdog that he set on me, and she even filed a malicious police complaint against me. For a year while I was on the waiting list for therapy, I was still brainwashed into thinking that I was the abusive one. How could I not be, when all his friends and even some of MY friends and family were on his side? It was only with therapy that I came to understand that this had been a tactic to isolate and control me. Unlike a previous ex, he never actually hit me. If he had, there would have been no self doubt, and more people would have supported me. Now THAT's someone you never get over. Oh yeah, and when I tried a revenge blowjob with a stranger the day after dumping him for ganging up on me with his mother AND nearly getting me killed not to mention trying to play me off against numerous others, said stranger tried to rape me. I'm too traumatised to even feel attracted to anybody now, and I know I will live and die alone for this reason. The solitude is quite nice when you get used to it though."
