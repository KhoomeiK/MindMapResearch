What you also need to be aware of is going hypermetabolic- that means your metabolism is gonna need more calories than normal to maintain and gain weight. It’ll be converting most of your intake to heat which is bad because it leaves your organs without the tissue repair they need. (I’m currently hypermetabolic) 

So the issue is you need more calories than ever, but Refeeding Syndrome can shut your body down if you get too many too fast. 

 An inpatient treatment facility is a good idea because they can guide you through meal plans with these factors in mind."
