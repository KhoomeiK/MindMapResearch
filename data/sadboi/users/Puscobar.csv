Bedbugs,evs46y8,t3_ckuy69,1564729171.0,"I saw a little one crawling on my bed sheet...

Long story short, they came from the apartment upstairs which my neighbors left completely trashed last month

As their usual food was gone, they crawled through the holes around the pipes in the ceiling to find their new favorite meal : me.

I’ve never noticed the bites before. But once I really searched for them, I noticed tiny dots, 2 or 3 in lines on my arms and legs.

There was absolutely no sign of bedbugs in my place, and still, there were there."

I didn’t react to their bites but after having a closer look at my skin, I did find tiny red spots. But you are right, sorry, it could be invisible on some people. My mistake."
Bedbugs,evjp7yo,t1_evjjjmm,1564567055.0,Yes :). And if you don’t have any bites it’s good sign that you are safe
