DeepIntoYouTube,fpr7n9a,t3_gf17pa,1588845360.0,I watched a few.  I have questions about his digestive system after eating printed paper daily. Does he poo it out in recognisable chunks?  Does it break down?  Is the ink staining his asshole or insides?  Doe he have undigested Nicolas cage heads inside him?
Anger,foetjl3,t3_g72psf,1587714258.0,"I hate sport but I will watch sport so I have a socially acceptable reason to yell to release my anger.  Also a piece of wood and some nails,  random hitting with a hammer helps me to release the desire to smash stuff. Neighbours just think you are shit at building rather than yelling for no reason. I love smashing stuff,  occasionally I will go and smash sticks on trees or smash crockery on bricks, I do this out bush.  Then clean it up which is anti climactic but it helps my urge and helps me to be less angry. 
Smash it safely."
depression,flfoef8,t1_fleap47,1585112281.0,"I would not recommend having a child to ward off depression or suicidal thoughts.  I worked damn hard and thought I was in a pretty solid place then had a child,  shit came tumbling down like 2000% more intense than when i was not a mum. I did not expect that,  I tried to prepare for what might unravel.  Other stuff happened.
I chose the path,  not my kid,  so il be damned if he has to live with the consequences of my behaviour and decisions.  I will not make him codependent on me because I have feelings (total other story) 
My desire for him to be free from the chains that bind us to trauma or whatever is why I get up and fight. My life basically doesn't matter because I know my path,  allowing my son the freedom in his emotions/thoughts/desires etc 
I will repeat this,  having a kid to ward off feelings of suicidality is the worst idea ever. You will have a kid with those feelings, not just you but a whole human who wants to live life while you don't,  it sucks and that is an understatement. there will be thoughts that come up that are way scarier to manage than ""what if I just kill myself "" trust me,  it is worse and it's even harder finding a professional to talk to about that stuff when it involves being a parent.  I am going through this right now. 
Total rant,  please don't make my mistake."

depression,flbivv8,t3_fnt1od,1585005555.0,"I have a kid, that makes me fight. Curiosity at what comes next,  but I think I must love the chaos. I tried when I was 8, it didn't work. I got told I was selfish for trying.  I guess I've spent that long trying not to be selfish.  Switzerland is interesting, I didn't know that."

newcastle,fioe5p0,t3_f8o585,1582581480.0,"Absolutely mental health issues, no reasonable healthy and adjusted human smokes ice and synthetic cannabis and produces that sort of fear. I would say horrible things happened to that mother that were untreated and now it is being passed on to those around this mother.  Obviously her daughter is her biggest victim.  That mother did not sit down and think I will have a child and harm it,  I bet life got unmanageable and she became unmanageable. And now this shit storm. Obviously she is in the wrong,  love and healing will help the daughter to be OK in the future,  understanding how her mother got to where she is will help that girl not repeat this actions."
newcastle,fimjiki,t3_f8o585,1582533042.0,That is totally insane.  I can see how the system allows that sort of thing to happen.  There is no support in this area for mothers with mental health issues.  It is really sad.  I hope that little girl gets some appropriate support.

ADHD,f5k63o1,t3_do29ul,1572255854.0,"Always.  It's peaceful and I can focus.  The incessant circle of thoughts drop away to a bearable him. Having a child has destroyed any productivity I had,  I am a non functioning mess because I haven't been able to make it work for us yet. 
Like others have said I wake up around 7pm regardless of how tired I am.  That is so interesting and it sucks that the world doesn't accommodate when we shine brightest."

aspergirls,f19isbb,t1_f192cj8,1569273023.0,"Me too,  I'm just going through a diagnosis after a lifetime of ""healing"" and I have a 3.5yr old who has emotions and reactions like me. It is the hardest thing ever. I'm really hoping with the support of the place I'm going that I will be able to learn how to manage myself and help him to manage himself. 
It's the worst rollercoaster because of my high expectations and layers of trauma,  just now realizing that I don't communicate very effectively, when I thought I did. I'm living my own worst nightmare. Zilch executive functioning, survival mode but there is hope.  I'm thinking of writing to Greta thunbergs mum and asking how did she do this?"
