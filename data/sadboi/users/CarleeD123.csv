Summary -  

>The story behind the numbers is that you and one other person have one tattooed on your wrist from birth adding a number as your personality develops and you develop, as to make the tattoo readable and accurately assign you with a soulmate that fits. The number is set in stone at age ten. Then, youâ€™re expected to attempt to find your soulmate as soon as possible. I found mine at age 14. Butâ€¦ it wasnâ€™t rightâ€¦ it couldnâ€™t be right. I mean no oneâ€™s ever heard of two boys being matched, right? So, I hid my numberâ€¦ for his sake. I started wearing hoodies, even went as far as to say that my number match had died. He just moved here, so nobody would know his number matched mine, right?

 It's Nagito Komeada x Hajime Hinata."
