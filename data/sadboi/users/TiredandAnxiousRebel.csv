Makeup,ey12gvx,t3_cup6m2,1566688201.0,Do they still sell the unscented version?
Makeup,exwqbxb,t1_exwp8pf,1566623201.0,Thank you! Have you tried other setting powders as well and find it to be a better product?
cats,eu3rnz9,t3_cem0ft,1563423175.0,I’m sorry for your loss. He’s a Beautiful cat.
Legitpiercing,eu3r2ji,t3_cel8bb,1563422635.0,Have you tried tree tea oil? It can work as a sanitizer and helps  with skin inflammation. I’ve heard it also helps with scarring and bumps when you have a piercing. I’ve read multiple sources saying it’s helpful for piercings as well as your sea salt regiment. Good luck! I hope this is helpful
asktrans,eu3p7mk,t1_es2lt91,1563421001.0,"I super  sorry about the late and long response. I think you made a really good point in your post. My boyfriend has a similar issue. I think in any relationship communication is key. I like how OP asked her boyfriend what he needed to feel secure. I think you could ask him things such as “ what do I do that makes you feel the most masculine?” It could be some stupid stereotype like opening jars I can’t open. It’s the little things that matter the most.  And gender is a social construct at the end of the day ( as I’m sure  you know)  and the gender goes they come with it are the same.  Boundaries are important when it comes to relationships in general. I often ask my boyfriend what he thinks a man is and what masculinity means to him... as well as remind him how much I love him and value him and how important he is to me, I usually say something along the lines of how he makes me feel safe and supported as a partner, he’s my partner in crime ( as cliche as it sound), that I chose him out of anyone else and that he’s the person I want with me when the shit hits the fan. Insecurity is hard for everyone and especially in his case where where are other factors. I think the only thing you can really do is be supportive of him, remind me of his value, that his feelings are valid, you are hearing his concerns and are willing to work with him ( as long as it’s reasonable and does not isolate you) , remind him that he’s the person you chose, etc.  and also encourage him to talk to others ( as in other man about what masculinity is/ people undergoing similar situations because it’s lethargic and healing  to meet someone going through the same things you are- there are actually online groups for those who are trans/transitioning/non-binary that may be helpful as well as forums and so on. They may be able to relate to him on another level and give advice on a way that you may not be able to). I know it’s not an easy situation for either of you and I wish you luck- he’s lucky to have such a thoughtful girlfriend as you are. I know it’s not easy to love someone and see they are struggling and not seeing themselves as the  amazing you see them as."
asktransgender,eu3by64,t3_cedqjd,1563410636.0,"I think that it’s not inherently bad that you noticed as someone already mentioned previously it’s involuntary and as humans we like to categorize others and put them in “boxes”.  I think it’s also important to point out that you realized what you did could be harmful to her and her feelings. No one likes to be talked about behind their backs( however, I think it’s a common fault to have to gossip with others or turn to someone else for verification/ confirmation). Does it make it okay? No but it’s also not uncommon.  Maybe next time keep your thoughts to yourself and use that empathy you are demonstrating in asking and being aware of what you may have done."
trippinthroughtime,eu38tif,t1_eu22vm2,1563408305.0,One of my favorite times in university was when I  was able to pet this seeing eye dog that I’ve seen for years when she had her vest off when I happened to be in the same office as her owner worked in. She was so sweet and ran up and down office.
OldManDog,eu38bfc,t3_cecn6r,1563407934.0,I love Cindy- to be honest i would fit for her. She looks like a sweetheart
Skincare_Addiction,eu37ubi,t3_cekijh,1563407588.0,Have you tried Vaseline? I know it may sound stupid but it may be helpful and at night putting a sock with the bottom cut off so it kinda is up against your skin at night and allows for prime moisturizing? That’s what my sister use to do when she has super dry skin and it seemed to help.
confusing_perspective,eu37hep,t3_cec6o8,1563407331.0,That’s amazing! I love it
reactivedogs,eu37a7w,t3_cegf09,1563407184.0,"To add to those before me, when you have more than two dogs, it becomes a pack and that can make it more difficult due to them wanting to protect one another ( and you!) and act as one,so it maybe easier to have two out at a time max until they are more well adjusted. It’s also helpful to have someone else to help in keeping everyone calm if you choose to go down that route. Good luck!"
Adoption,eu36va9,t1_eu2cm7z,1563406882.0,"No I don’t think it’s bad at all. I think it’s natural as humans to want to have a connection and seek others who share a biological tie to us.  It was definitely a difficult decision that I can’t imagine making. I think it’s great you are able to still be part of her life and see how her life is developing little by little. I’m adopted and I think it would’ve been nice if I had been given the option to be able to meet my biological parents not only for health reasons, but also to see where my roots came from and if I inherited any of their mannerism ( I want to see how much nature had to shape me).  I would also like to thank them for making that sacrifice for me. Unfortunately, I am unable to do that due to circumstances of my adoption."
askwomenadvice,eu35s9i,t3_cedtcx,1563406095.0,"I may be late to the party, but tampons that have a plastic applicator ( paper ones are painful and a real pain) that are regular or light. I think they actually have some for teens ( Tampax and Always)and first timers. You should still wear a panty liner with a tampon since it’s not always 100% effective. They come with direction in the box, but also there are videos on their website if that isn’t sufficient( it’s also easier when you have a heavier flow). Also there are heating pads that help with cramps ( some even are stuffed animals that you can warm in the microwave to help with cramps). Also caffeine can make periods/cramps worse. Make sure that she’s taking enough iron in her diet once she starts ( it may lead to anemia and fainting as well as migraines/headaches, weakness/fatigue).  Kudos to you and being open to learning about and being open about periods and not making it weird/uncomfortable. Oh I forgot to add that having an app to track my period is helpful in planning when my period may come up ( it helped with  planning- but it could also be affected by outside factors like stress, weight gain, etc.)"
depression,eu34juc,t3_cedl6i,1563405211.0,Congrats! Asking for help help and seeking help can be one of the most daunting and difficult parts of mental health- it can be scary to admit you need help. I am glad you are getting the help you need :) <3
Anxiety,eu34d7k,t3_ced3nz,1563405080.0,"Congrats! Driving is not always easy, especially on the freeway ( in the dark no less)."
