WritingPrompts,fpqwgpw,t3_gexx41,1588834314.0,"Conrad drunkenly stumbled down the alleyway. There was a bit of puke on his left shoe, fresh. He had 8 whiskey sours and then a couple shots of Jameson. By all accounts he was intoxicated. The alley was dimly lit by a streetlamp on the main drag. Finally, after a few minutes of stumbling around, supporting himself with the brick wall of the building to his right, Conrad fell down to butt and slumped over. 

&#x200B;

Conrad sat at the bar as he ordered his eight drink, the final whiskey sour of the night. 

""Hey! Aren't you Conrad the Destroyer?""

Conrad turned and looked over his shoulder.

""Who's asking?""

The man who called Conrad's attention stepped forward. 

""I'm so sorry, but I'm a huge fan. What you did to those God damn 'super heroes' last week really blew my mind!""

Audibly snorting in jest, Conrad fully turned to face the man. The man was covered in tattoos and had a disheveled beard. His hair was unkempt and greasy. He was skinny, nearly to the bone, and just over 6 feet tall. Couldn't weigh more than a buck fifty. To Conrad's six five, two hundred and seventy pound of muscle, Conrad towered over the man even as he still sat on his bar stool. 

""And why is it,"" Conrad began to stand up ""that you idolize my work?""

The man's face slowly glowed with excitement. He leaned in closer to Conrad and spoke quietly. 

""Because I hate these people. I hate this world. Let it burn, Conrad. We need to burn the system and start again! Seeing you stand up to the man, to take down these phonies, it inspires me. Truly fills me with joy.""

Conrad, now fully standing, looked like a monument statue over the man. He seemed like a God, only he was quite the opposite. He was the villain. 

Conrad grabbed the man by the back of his neck and slammed his face into the bar. Before the man even had a moment to comprehend the attack, he was dead. 

The bartender and the few other patrons stood in silence, gawking at Conrad. Conrad began to move toward the door, grabbing two shots poured for a couple, and downed them back to back. 

&#x200B;

Conrad found himself in an alley. He stumbled down into a slouch.

He couldn't stand admirers, always fawning over his ""accomplishments"". Always finding joy in his destruction.  He didn't do it to please anyone, quite the contrary. He murdered and destroyed because he thrived on the misery of others. No one was safe.  His worshipers only angered him, because he wanted them to be in pain. 

Conrad made sure of that. The man in the bar had learned his lesson. 

""I am the villain. I am the villain. I am the villain..."""
WritingPrompts,fpn6nc8,t3_ge2e6e,1588752072.0,"“Budget cuts? For real?” 

“Unfortunately” the angel said, slumped on my left shoulder.

The devil on my right shoulder leaned against my neck. 

“It’s a sad day, old pal” He said. “Almost brings a tear to my eye. I wish we could have one last cigarette together”

“So you’re leaving?” I responded in a panic. “I’ll have no one to guide me? I’ll just be on my own?”

Both the angel and the devil sighed at the same time. 

“No. We’re being replaced.”

The angel and the devil began floating away when angel looked down on me. 

“He’ll be here at midnight. He will have more info on his duties.”

They left at eight in the morning. I called in sick for work, cracked open a beer, and put on the TV. As the hours drifted on, I missed my companions. I felt lonely without them. I thought about how much they had influenced my life. The angel had gotten me to become a social worker and do good for the world. The devil showed me the sinful pleasures of sex, money, and cigarettes.

The devil had pressured me into my first cigarette, despite the angel’s pleas, when I was 17. I did anyway, and had been a smoker ever since. The angel had always given me grief about smoking. I couldn’t have a single cigarette without a length harassment full of shame. However, with the angel gone, I could smoke one in peace. Sure, it would be lonely without the devil having one with me, but a cigarette alone is better than none at all. 

I looked at the clock, it was midnight. A gray orb appeared in front of me. I was startled and let out a little yell. 

It spoke in a monotone voice, no part of the orb moving. “Calm down, I’m the replacement” 

“Wha… what are you?”

“I’m the morally ambiguous blob of unbiased matter, MABUM. God and Satan created me due to the recent budget cuts. The two are fighting it out right now and need to put their resources towards other matters. They’re both working really hard on the apocalypse and figured they’d give up on trying to persuade humans toward either team. So they teamed up and sent me.”

“The apocalypse? What are you talking about?”

MABUM gave a quick chuckle, then continued in monotone. “Maybe I wasn’t supposed to tell you. Oh well, life goes on. At least for me, you’ll be dead soon. Because of the end of times and all. 

I asked MABUM, “Well, where am I going? If this is the rapture, where am I going to end up?”

“Oh, I don’t know that I am supposed to tell you… All I know is you’re a close call, but you didn’t hear it from me.”

“What do you mean I’m a ‘close call’?”

MABUM floated around “Well that’s why they sent me. A lot of people simply lost their angel and devil. I’m here to monitor your final moments to see if you either go to heaven or hell. Otherwise you’ll be stuck in purgatory. Not much fun at all. Hopefully you end up going up or down before the asteroid hits.”

“When is the asteroid coming?” I asked in a panic. 

“Oh, shoot. I wasn’t supposed to tell you.  An asteroid should hit here any minute. Your last actions are going to decide which way you go.

I thought for a moment. For once, my fate was left up to me. No angel persuading me to get to heaven. No devil telling me how to go to hell. I was free to choose what I wanted. And yet I had no idea which side to choose. 

“You basically are going to be sent to purgatory unless you do something quick. Want to get to heaven? You need a good to do some sort of good deed, and quick. 

“Well what should I do?”

“Beats me.”

“Aren’t you supposed to help with that?” I yelled. “Aren’t you supposed to guide me and give me advice?”

“I suppose I could, but I really don’t have a preference one way or the other.”

I became frustrated and started yelling at MABUM as loud as I could. I yelled until my face was red. I cried. I continued my tirade until I lost my voice. When it finally came to an end, I was shaking. 

“I need a cigarette.”

Without a second thought, I pulled my pack out of my pocked and lit one up. MABUM sighed. 

“The devil loves to smoke.”

The asteroid plummeted towards earth. Humans across the world were incinerated in a giant wave of fire. I smoked my Marlboro Red up until the very end. I suppose I always knew my fate. At least soon I’d be smoking with the devil."
