Sadly there is no cookie cutter solution to depression. Each person has to look for a way that works for them to help themselves out."
SuicideWatch,fkhygbg,t1_fkh3q6z,1584208332.0,"Every experience, mental illness included changes us. That change stays with us for as long as we live, but it is up to us to not let it define our lives or even our death. I don't like how my depression changed me, I don't like how I lost countless years of my life to its ability to cripple me, I still have bad days and I always fear it is going to come back worse than before. That being said, I decided for my own sake that I'll keep trying to make my life better. It's by no means perfect and I'm certain it will never be perfect, but now, for the most part I am content with my day to day life and that's good enough to keep me going. Bottom line is we live first and foremost for us, not for others and for their expectations of us."

AMA,fk9mqvk,t1_fk9jsr3,1583979107.0,"Family and friends can hurt you deeply and endlessly. We are not obliged to continue living in torment in order for others to not be sad, uncomfortable or even hurt. Our first and foremost obligation is to ourselves. It is bettering our situation and our lives for us, not for our friends nor for our family. Like when the oxygen masks drop in an airplane. First you put on yours, then you help the person beside you. Op needs a solution for herself and for her sake, she doesn't need a guilt trip.

I am by no means condoning her solution although I can understand her situation and her reasoning, but having been where she is I would've been furious to be told to continue living in misery so can others can enjoy their lives while I suffer.

PS I don't mean to come off as aggressive or rude, so apologies in advance if this is how the above seems to whoever reads it."
AMA,fk9jux3,t1_fk9j1ws,1583977490.0,I wish you the all the best and if you change your mind and want to talk to someone and while I am by no means an expert I'd be glad to talk to you so feel free to dm me at any time.
AMA,fk9ivca,t1_fk9hpgo,1583976945.0,"The way I think is that as far as we know (religious views aside) we only get one chance at life on earth and as hopeless and shitty as it can become as long as we live there is also the potential and perhaps even hope of things getting better. We look at others and think that they have this perfect life and it seems as if they have the world at their feet but we don't really know about their struggles. We are all going to die eventually, is it worth taking the risk of wasting that one chance we are given at life? If I got to have a say in the matter, I wouldn't have been born, however, I am here now and I will continue to be here until something happens and I am not. Until this something, whatever it might be I will continue to try and make the most of what time I have left and in my opinion so should you and everyone else."
AMA,fk9hgsz,t1_fk9h1f1,1583976155.0,"It's not nuts. You love him more than your own life and that's rare, but you're not in a situation where it's you or him who gets to live. You can both do it. May I ask what you think caused/causes your depression and suicidal feelings?"
AMA,fk9gsj9,t1_fk9ei9d,1583975769.0,"If he is with you for 10 years then it seems to me like he cares and wants to be there with and for you. It isn't a waste of time on his part and just because you don't have someone to help you right now it doesn't mean that this someone doesn't exist; you just need to keep looking.

I've been where you're at. I was convinced living isn't worth it; that it's just suffering to no foreseeable end and utter hopelessness. And I was convinced that death would be a preferable alternative. That was about 10 years ago and it took me years after I made an attempt on my life to actually get better. As impropable as it seems to you right now it actually can happen and you can get better. I honestly know it doesn't seem so, but it can happen if you allow it to."

LegalAdviceEurope,fjlh8iw,t3_fdzx2s,1583446574.0,Contact your bank and ask them how to proceed.
LegalAdviceEurope,fikim7q,t3_f888hz,1582481051.0,"Find a safe place to stay. For example with a friend, otherwise somewhere where he wouldn't immediately find you. Pack your essentials and cats and leave when he isn't home. Also, contact a lawyer asap, tell them about the physical abuse and he will guide you on what to do next. Your wellbeing comes first, money can be settled later."
