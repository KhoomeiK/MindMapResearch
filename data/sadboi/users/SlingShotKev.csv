I would start with that and add a quality mic as soon as possible to your shoe mount. I will always recommend the VideoMic Pro but there are certainly less-expensive alternatives if you do some research. Having good quality audio is almost as important, if not more, than having good quality video.

You should be ready to roll after that! Next steps would be picking up a couple portable RGB lights, Aputure MC or similar, and figure out then what you could add to ease your process of creation.
