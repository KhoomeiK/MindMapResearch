Ive never worked with Sony files before and I was surprised how desaturated they were. I did some color correction after brushing in layers, but obviously id probably have a workflow in LR for these files if I shot Sony. Didn't really get the skies where I wanted them but eh, its overcast.

RealEstatePhotography,fphtt9a,t1_fph6qr2,1588627681.0,"Well I'm new too so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt. But if you plan to work for her again maybe agree on a better hourly rate that benefits both of you...you did say that you spent more time shooting than you planned. That could help keep shots on schedule too. It sounds like most photographers are licensing per image in addition to an hourly or day rate...instead maybe include a set number of images in your hourly and then leave it up to her to license extra images if she needs. Someone else said not to change the rate you charge her, which is the respectful thing to do. But perhaps don't include as many images next time around and explain that going forward you need to slightly alter the agreement considering she is using the images for commercial purposes.

Another idea is that if she is working with other contractors who wants to license your work then you could add a 20% 3rd party licensing fee and it would be cheaper for them to split the cost. 

All that said, for any other commercial clients they should pay per image and and pay a base rate whether it be hourly or per day."
