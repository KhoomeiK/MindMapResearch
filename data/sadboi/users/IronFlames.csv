It's pretty safe to assume that 3PO is using the same kind of shell in the later movies. His red arm also enforces this theory. 

3PO and R2 both know and have worked with Anakin and Padme. I wouldn't think it's weird to swap droids so that they get the one better suited to their lifestyle. I don't know if there's a canon answer, but R2 could've been reassigned to Anakin. Anakin built 3PO when he was a slave to help his mom. When he became a Jedi, 3PO wasn't really built to follow that lifestyle. Giving him to someone like Padme just shows how good Anakin is at droid work.

AskTechnology,flgv9zd,t3_foplyl,1585150986.0,"I had a coworker who had a bachelor's degree in computer science, and it focused on development work. He was working a lower end Local IT position with me. He wasn't very tech-savy.

We discussed it a few times, and he would've changed to being a mechanic if he could go back. 

My local community college only offers associate's degrees, so I could only do so much there. I did enjoy my courses there though. I transferred to a university closer to me, and I had a horrible experience with my courses, so I transferred out after one semester. 

I'm currently at Western Governor's University, and I am really enjoying the online setup. Choose your school based on what you want to do, not what the school thinks you should do. You can try doing some of the certificates you mentioned to make sure that's what you want to do. You are studying computer science. Usually you can choose what direction in computer science you take without truly changing your major. Talk to your school counselor and see what you can do at your university without transferring. I suggest this, because some courses might not transfer over

You should do what makes you happy. Spending more time and money to find out what you love won't be nearly as bad as graduating with a degree you don't want. There are a lot of people who focus on security and administration, and hate to code. The opposite is true as well."
