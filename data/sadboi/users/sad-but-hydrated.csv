NoStupidQuestions,fqe5yve,t3_gieu3c,1589302298.0,"I think one of the delights of poetry is that you're free to interpret it any way you want. In high school, you had to find the ""right"" meaning, rather than enjoying the work for how it made you feel, or what it made you think about. 

Poems should invoke feeling, even if you don't understand each word or metaphor. Personally, i like to read them to myself aloud sometimes. A tip that helped me was to read the sentences, and pause only on period or comas - don't pause after every line break. 

Additionally, you don't have to read all the sad bummer poets. Poems are as diverse as books, so find the types of poetry that appeal to you. Personally, i  don't wanna read Sylvia Plath's depression poetry. I'd rather read Ogden Nash or Shel Silverstein! 

Finally, don't exclude any kind poetry. Shel Silverstein's ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" is a ""kid's book"" but it's a great read as an adult. There's no right or wrong way to enjoy poetry - and you definitely don't have to read exclusively the dusty old poets they teach in H.S.. The best part is that you have complete autonomy to choose which poets you read - hell, you could read exclusively naughty limericks! lol"

Weddingsunder10k,fmuj54c,t1_fmueac6,1586392432.0,"How fun!! love that : ) I also have a fondness for plastic shoes, and had grew up wearing jellies - my sister and i had a bunch of matching pairs. Specifically we had a pair that was clear with gold glitter. 

&#x200B;

Just like jellies, my wedding shoes gave me blisters from HELL! But it was worth it because they're amazing and I still wear them (and get blisters lol)"
Weddingsunder10k,fmuirka,t1_fmtxrbu,1586392218.0,"Well, there were 20 people, but i'd say a solid 12 were elderly, and don't drink. We bought some wine and beer in bulk from a liquor mart, and then some mixers etc. We even had a couple bottles left afterwards! lol Food was also heavily discounted because we were regulars at the place we ordered from, and they cut us a deal."
Weddingsunder10k,fmuihof,t1_fmu2qe0,1586392066.0,"Thanks! In retrospect, i wish I'd had them wear little cocktail dresses in a shade of green -and let them choose the dress. I feel bad that they had to pay $60 for a dress they'd wear only once!!"
Weddingsunder10k,fmuic82,t1_fmudv36,1586391982.0,"Thank you so much! the dress was my big splurge. I love that suit - he still wears it when we go out. He had it tailored, and the fit it amazinggg"

edit: I FOUND IT!! [https://mikaellabridal.com/collections/gowns-collection/style-2107](https://mikaellabridal.com/collections/gowns-collection/style-2107)

I don't know if they're still selling my exact dress (got married 3 yrs ago)- but i saw a lot of fit&flare, long train, plunging neckline gowns with buttons all up the back.

Honestly the buttons up the back sold me on my gown, i felt impossibly glamorous."
