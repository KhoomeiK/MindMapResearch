Anxiety,fr03re4,t3_gluquz,1589782860.0,"For me caffeine and stress can cause nightmares so I avoid the first and find ways to calm myself before bed. also smoking weed makes me not dream. however, infrequent smokers can get more vivid dreams initially before dreams subside. You can also try sleep aids as they may help you sleep deeper or harder.

If you can't avoid having nightmares then sometimes learning to cope with them once you wake up could help (talk about them, write them down, justify them as irrational fears, or any other technique).

My nightmares can really bother me and I never know when they happen but increasing my overall health has diminished them to a point where I can stay sober and I only get them once a week or less. I used to fear sleep like you but now the nightmares are simply a nuisance I deal with from time to time.

I wish you luck and sweet dreams, friend. You deserve rest."

getting_over_it,fn3cjll,t3_fz23nz,1586617893.0,"I've had to talk with my brother about this our whole lives because we grew up in a smaller Midwest town with him being half black/half white and me being white. He often had to deal with feelings of ""too black for the white kids and too white for the black"" long before I heard it from Earl sweatshirt.


We both dealt with it in diff ways: I mostly stopped hanging out with white people for a long time cause I couldn't deal with their latent racism popping out when they were alone with me thinking I was cool with it just cause I was white and I'd get into fights because of it. People don't get to talk about my family like that, we're literally blood.


For my brother obviously it was much worse because it started younger and he had more time to end up internalizing their ignorance. His dad wasn't around and when they later connected, it really only made it worse because he is tbh not a good man and my brother ended up learning that. Its not all his fault given life circumstances but, it is what it is and he wasn't there to give my brother the solidarity and support he needed and when he went to my dad for support my dad ended up being shitty and racist too. However, when my brother was younger he did spend a lot of time with his father's sister/mother/cousins  around the same time I was swearing off white people. They still talk often. I never talked with him much about how he felt about that but, I want to believe it helped him form life long connections with that side of himself and family to alleviate some of that internalizing but, my brother still calls me 30 years later when it's getting to him. Sometimes he'll cry and ask me why ""they"" hate him and why ""they"" treat him that way.


TBH there isn't an answer other than hopefully learning to accept that there isn't anything different between us. We're human and that's it. The racists are so ignorant that they're making a up an imaginary person to hate just because they're weak and scared of their own thoughts. Never take anything they say like it matters. We don't need that around us. We don't need that in our life. We don't need that in our hometown or our country. There is no room in my heart for those people. It still gets me angry faster that literally anything else in the world much like it does for you but, now that I'm older I can use my knowledge and experience to talk circles around them and expose how truly ignorant, weak and childish they really are.


If you ever want facts about racism or skin color they're not usually gonna come from a white person so why waste the time even listening to them talk about it. Tune them out if it's possible and move on with your life because they're clearly not trying. Don't let them stop you from loving yourself. Don't let them make you feel like you should change."
