rant,f1jm6oa,t1_f0wl32g,1569524884.0,"Shit man that sucks! Sorry for the really late reply, I don't log onto this account very often since it's not my main. My maths teacher still bothers me with the way he treats students that don't understand the material in such a condescending and belittling way, but I've mostly gotten over it by putting in effort to be a good student. He's still an asshole, just not to me, which still sucks but eh.

Either way, hope you've had a wonderful 5 days since you posted this comment! Sending lots of love your way =)"

Nah  I'm the type to keep quiet when I feel any sort of serious negative  emotion. Honestly just typing it out and sobbing for a minute helped me  get over it, so I'm all good now. This alt is my coping mechanism haha.

Thanks for caring though, it means a lot. Hope you've had a fantastic day so far =)"

My mother still won't let me walk around town by myself & my dad berates me when I pick up litter off the ground. Eastern European by the way, but I guess my family is far more traditional and weird than others, so maybe they're Latin at heart lol.

Thanks a lot for the kind words and advice, you sound like a wonderful individual and a great mother, your children must be very lucky. I hope the rest of your week ends up being as awesome as you are, and that applies to every reply to this post :)"

It led to me practically being raised by the internet, so I guess my views are more progressive and American than most people where I live haha.  
Thanks a lot for the kind words, y'all actually made my day. Hope you have an amazing week man =)"

That's exactly what I do when I want something. It ain't the cleanest solution, but it does the trick. As for everything else, thanks a bunch for the support, it means a lot to me. Keep on being the awesome person that you are :)"

I walk in thinking that it won't do much, since I'm not actually talking to somebody else, but it honestly does make a huge difference. As you said, documenting your feelings feels like getting them out of your head & almost like talking to someone else. It's great."
