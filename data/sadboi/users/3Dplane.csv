demisexuality,fm391wv,t1_fm0v4uz,1585716139.0,"I can also relate to this. I ""know"" I have qualities that people find physically attractive, but it's mainly due to other people pointing it out. I don't exactly ""feel"" attractive by default.

I've always had confidence and self image issues so that's where I attribute it. But now that you mention it, maybe this also has something to do with how I interpret what it means to be attractive as well. 

Either way, I think it's also important to have a healthy self image. Having attractive physical qualities may be subjective, but having a healthy image will make you feel comfortable with yourself regardless of what other people think."
mentalhealth,fm09ui4,t1_fm08rfq,1585650389.0,"Agreed but I'm at a loss about these things. It's mostly ignorance on the part of the person at fault. There are things that should never been joked about nor taken lightly. 

The only thing we can do is raise awareness and offer support to those in need. This is on top of seeking therapy and medication if needed. Professional help is important but a support group may be just as essential. 

We may not be able to address ignorance right away, but we can always stand beside those in need."

It's important to not let these negative people win over you. Don't let their hate and ignorance get the better of you. Seek help and therapy. Surround yourself with people that do have your best interest in mind."
demisexuality,fm00bo7,t3_fs59wc,1585639773.0,"I've been getting comments from my friends saying that I'm fairly attractive and would have found someone by now if I jus showed interest. Initially, I legitimately did not know how or what to feel. I didn't know how to respond to those comments and I didn't know what I should have felt when interacting with people I'm sexually oriented to. So for years I've had the impression that I'm just numb and need to overcome this numbness. I've had resentments towards myself because of this.

Currently I'm still not in a relationship and I've never been in a relationship. I'm actually a little thankful for that because deep down inside, I felt like I was forcing myself to be someone else. I'm thankful for all the opportunities I've had in learning more about myself, how I may be demi or whatever. I still have some struggles, but I've grown to accept myself more. Right now I'm feeling a little confident and open to seeing and dating people. Now isn't a good time because of the virus, but I'm looking forward to it after. And if I end up meeting someone, I'll see how it goes. Something may or may not happen but that's ok. I'll be comfortable knowing I'm enough as a person and I make choices in line with what I truly want."
mentalhealth,flj88z5,t3_fp5vfj,1585202163.0,"Learning how to self love and self care properly. We've been accustomed to put ourselves second in our pursuit of success in this world. We've been taught that thinking about our self and we'll being is selfish. In reality, we are the person we will be sending them rest of our lives with and this alone Mae's self care all the more important. 
Self care taught me to take care of yourself as I would take care of a close friend or family. You owe it to yourself to be good to yourself. It is to forgiving mistakes, acknowleding the small vicotories, even the ones nobody notices, and keeping my mental health in check."
mentalhealth,flj7ux3,t3_fp3vn2,1585201781.0,"This sounds like a self destructive behavior. You could see a therapist to sort things out. Self destructive behaviors are I think quite well documented. The feeling of seeking toxicity could stem from past experiences or childhood upbringing. If someone grew up in a toxic environment as children, they may have made unconscious bonds relating toxicity with affection. Like for example the practice of spanking children and telling them spanking is a form of love can equate pain with a form of love. 

Or the cause may be something else and the mind is looking for ways to cope with a past or recurring experience. Can't say much more into this but it's great that you are aware of this tendency. Awareness is a crucial part of self improvement. Wishing you the best."
mentalhealth,flgd2d2,t3_folchz,1585139341.0,"From where I'm from, you can go straight to a psychologist or pychiatrist. From there, they will give tests and interviews to get to know you, what you're feeling, your history, and things like that. 

It may seem scary to open up and uncover the inner workings of your mind and wait for a string of diagnoses that could fit you best, but it's the first step to self growth. Testing could take more than a couple of meetings. It may feel accurate or inaccurate, but it's an ongoing process. It's also not set in stone. The diagnoses could change as time goes by but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Nobody is a static being to begin with. 

Whatever results you may get, it is important not to feel scared or ashamed. In knowing so, you'll be able to have a better picture of yourself and you'll have somewhere to begin your journey of self growth and self improvement. 

It's also very important not to place your identity on your diagnoses. We define them but they do not define us. We are a whole other person outside of what we are going through. Self improvement is not a linear thing. There will be good days and bad days but we have to keep moving forward."
demisexuality,flgaxzi,t3_fomsaq,1585137405.0,"I don't know if I'm a demi, but so far I'm relating with this community quite well and even enlightening at times.
I have had the same experiences with your's. Despite my country being somewhat conservative, it sometimes gets brought up in conversations especially with more liberal peers. It simply makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm a 25 year old virgin and I don't think I'm repulsed by sex. I'm quite curious about it but I don't feel at ease talking about it unless it's with people I'm very comfortable with. I feel a bit alienated and appear to be a prude. I usually don't have the words to explain my feelings, behaviors, and attitudes towards sex, but I feel like demi sexuality is a good fit so I'm reading more about it. I'm just lucky enough to find a circle of friends that could sense my discomfort and refrain from bringing it up even."
dating,fldm3k1,t3_fo6323,1585067267.0,"We all have our standards and I think it's fine. The term lowering standards doesn't really sound right for me. Instead of lowering your standards, be more open with people. Give chances. Take leaps of faith and see how it goes. And if you don't feel that way towards the other person then there's nothing wrong about that either. Best not to force a relationship."
mentalhealth,fld5gzj,t3_fo2xwm,1585057030.0,"In my experience, my therapist says this is all a spring board, a place to start. There's meds, self reflection, and exercises. It really did help me but there came a point where I had to do my part as well. I had to believe in myself that I'll get better and that I  can be better. So yes, I can say I needed my therapist and the extent of how effective it was was also up to me. It wasn't a linear thing. There were good days and bad days. But it's important to keep going and believe in yourself even it gets tiring.

One important thing I realized is when I shifted my goal. I shifted my goal from wanting the depression to go away, to becoming a better person. And with this little shift in persective, somehow it made things easier. So the depression may or may not really go away and I learned to accept that. It may still be there, but I can be a better version of myself. And for me, the load didn't feel any lighter but I felt myself getting mentally stronger and could lift it better. And again, this was in tandem with therapy.

Hope this helps and wishing all the best."

Right now my country is under quarantine, my family is abroad, and I've been stressing over Grad school. It's important to focus on yourself and your well being during these times. I try to stamp out negative thoughts when I feel like they're taking over. Resuming hobbies I've put off like reading and learning new skills like how to cook also helps. I've also tried making pen pals overseas to meet new perspectives. There are apps for those 

Can I also ask what you mean by human connection? Maybe defining it could help knowing what you need."

I have dependency issues as well and have been diagnosed with Dependent Personality Disorder and Avoidant Personality disorder. They both involve having fears of abandonment. I haven't had much luck with relationships but have started focusing on myself first.  Practicing self love helped me with managing myself greatly. I also like listening to Lisa Romano. Here's a link to one of her videos. She talks about codependency issues, gives exercises on how to become aware when they start manifesting, and more.

We are all just human beings and try not to beat yourself up when you make mistakes. Try having a conversation with your self. Try to get to know yourself better without looking at yourself like you're a villain. Really get down to the inner workings of your mind. The reason for this is to be more aware with yourself and the negative behaviours you want to resolve. You may also find things underneath the surface that could also contribute to your current disposition. It's a little scary, to look within your mind and confronting these things, but it is essential to your growth. 

Wishing you the best."
mentalhealth,flctzba,t3_fo1508,1585046483.0,"Don't beat yourself up about not knowing how to love yourself. Truly loving yourself is a learned skill, that you need to make an active effort with. The hardest part is to really sit down and have a conversation with yourself. It's to face your own self image and how you really see yourself.  It's forgiving yourself for your shortcomings and continually forgiving yourself even when it doesn't feel worth it.  It's being aware of your negative behaviors and coping mechanisms and being aware when they arise and stopping them before they take over. It's   
It's patting yourself in the back with every small victory, including the ones nobody notices. Surround yourself with people that genuinely support and see you grow.

It also helps cutting toxic people out; the ones that have nothing nice to say and contribute nothing to your well being. There's so much more to it but I'm not qualified to give professional advice. I too have my own self love journey right now and I just want to see people succeeding in their's. It's an ongoing process that you have to walk and practice everyday. It may seem daunting; there will be good and bad days, but we have to keep going. The journey is well worth it. You deserve it and you owe it to yourself. Hope this helps and wishing for the best."
mentalhealth,flcsxiq,t3_fo29hq,1585045185.0,"Preach. I get that it's nice to find like minded people to fill your niche, but it can go very badly if the group feeds off of negative behavior and inadvertently perpetuates negative behaviors. It's hard to reach out to people that actively close themselves off. And sad to think some people build their identities around their negativity."
mentalhealth,flaedle,t3_fnk22w,1584982204.0,"Ah I'm so sorry to hear that. We've all had our fair share of invalidations, and non of it is fair. Simply non of it is fair to the people carrying their own baggage. Forget those guys. They're just so embittered about their own resenents and frustrations in life. I know everyone is carrying something, but damn... Some people are just so near sighted and caught up with their own negativity that they simply have to pull people down to their level.

Forget those guys. Their opinions don't apply to you. Not everyone is going to be able to contribute to your well being and the best thing to do is to leave those people behind and never look back. Keep moving forward.

Know that you're not alone in your loneliness. There's loads of other people out there wishing you the best. That's the kind of people you have to surround yourself with."
socialskills,fkq8ta0,t3_fk0b57,1584435521.0,"Same. I think it's just how some people are wired to be. I'm prone to information overload not just academically but also in processing the things that happen thru out the day. When that happens, I can be a little slow to react and make clear decisions. I'm not too bummed about it and have been trying to look for healthier coping mechanisms. Struggled a lot in college/uni, now I'm a year and a half into grad school. Hang in there and keep moving forward. 

Also try not to compare yourself with other people. You have other things to offer and don't be afraid to try new things as well."
mentalhealth,fkq8fxp,t1_fkq6ywq,1584435037.0,"I'm really sorry to hear that. It's ok to feel a little lost. True self love is something you learn. Its actively reminding yourself to get back up when you're down. It's actively calling out self sabotage and other negative thoughts. It's being aware when your negative thoughts and behaviors are acting up and stopping them from taking over.

As for your previous relationship, let it go. Don't think about it. Whatever he's doing or whatever you think is going on with his life, let it go. Start focusing on yourself. Get to know yourself better. You are a whole other person outside of that relationship. 

The hardest part is really sitting down and confronting all those negative thoughts and self image. It's an ongoing process that you have to keep doing. But it's all going to be worth it. You'll start to feel more confident since you'll pay less attention on what other people think and more on what you think. Learning how to love yourself will make you realize how you want to be loved and treated by others around you. Learning to love yourself will enable you to set healthier boundaries. You'll be able to realize a lot of other things if you give yourself a chance."
mentalhealth,fkq7jgm,t3_fjy5rg,1584433883.0,"Hi there. I have social anxiety and a couple of other mental and personality disorders. I'm new to Reddit but it's a great place to find people who really get you . That being said you're not alone in this.

This year I've been making it a point to practice legitimate self care and self love routines. Once I realized I was projecting my need of validation to other people, it opened a whole new perspective for me. It's not so much as me being less of a person because of all the things I'm dealing with, but rather I was putting too much pressure on myself and on how others percieved who I am as a person. 

The scary part is sitting down and confronting all the self sabotage and negative thoughts. I needed to tell myself that I am valid. My struggles are valid. I may not be as outgoing or as sociable as some other people, but that's ok. I am me. Sometimes I just can't and that's ok, but on the days I do have the strength, I pat myself on the back for being able to. Even when things don't work out, I still pat myself in the back for trying. I'll find people who do accept me, and even if I haven't found those people yet, I accept me. 

Hope this helps."
mentalhealth,fkq6uwx,t3_fk0zyf,1584433032.0,"The truth is, It's all about self love. 
What I learned from dealing with my own self inadequacies is that I was seeking validation from the people around me. It was great at the start, I was high on the feeling of being wanted. But it eventually never worked out. It never worked out because I could never get enough and I keep wanting more.

The truth is, validation has to come from within. If there's one person you should love unconditionally, it should be first and foremost yourself. You are the person you'll be spending the rest of your life with. So learn to love yourself. Even on bad days and even on days when you feel unlovable. And when you make mistakes, don't take it against yourself.

Love yourself as you would love another. Fogive yourself as you would forgive another. And look forward to the better version of yourself that's to come."

As with mental health, I tried not to take it against myself for having all of these things. I was learning new things about myself and new ways on how to take care of myself better. 

As with sharing them, it's within my discretion on whether I disclose my diagnoses or not. I don't have to share them if I don't feel safe to."

Hope this helps."
mentalhealth,fkdvkvf,t3_fhlwdw,1584096969.0,There are very valid grounds of not feeling comfortable about sharing your mental health to people and your parents are no exception. What I learned is to put your best interest into your own hands. Not everyone will be able to support you in the way you need and that's ok. I'm learning not to take it against people since they're just acting the only way they know how. Seek help. Surround yourself with people that do understand you and always tell yourself there's a light at the end of the tunnel even you don't feel like it. Keep going.
