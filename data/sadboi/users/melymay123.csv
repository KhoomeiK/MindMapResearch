infj,fldxm01,t3_fo08uj,1585073699.0,"I understand what you mean. I have recently found this in myself as well. I feel I am just becoming aware of it and I am 31. Looking back, I can't really recall how I felt about the injustice of the world. In my past, I guess I used to try to fix things that I could not fix. I wanted to work for the United Nations but that never happened. My dad would say to me, ""You live with the world on your shoulders"". For fun, I would volunteer lol. I remember my colleague giving another colleague a look of disapproval when she said she likes to volunteer for fun and I felt shame because I was like this as well. Recently, I started realize I need to find balance. I need to also take care of myself because only I know what I really need and I am also a person who deserves happiness.

I have felt a lot of anger and rage with people's response to COVID-19. Their carelessness, apathy, and lack of caring has caused fumes to almost burst. I am using my rage to try to help persuade people to stay home. For instance, I am using Linkedin to share the pleas from doctors for people to stay home. In this way, I am using my rage constructively rather than lashing out. This is part of the ideas promoted in Inner Bonding Workbook that I am currently reading. Existential rage is ok, because it is reality. But we have to take care of our rage in a constructive way. So this is what I set out to do. I am definitely not perfect at this and am just learning taking it one day at a time.

Just curious- what's your process to deal with this?"

We should all know about this occurring as it will help create a safer more just world. A few years ago, My mom was hit by a family member in a public place and they got in a fist fight. That family member pressed charges against my mom. Luckily a good Samaritan was there and testified in court that the family member started it. It was an awful situation to be accused of something you didn't do and to have to suffer because of it. I'm deeply sorry."
ABoringDystopia,fh72dzi,t3_f18e4n,1581312764.0,"This is a great point. Real change occurs when you change the entire system. So small tweaks are amazing but they treat the system not the cause of the injustice. The cause and the system must be revised to really impact people. For instance, I have joined feed the homeless groups where we would make sandwiches and such and give them to homeless people downtown. While this is a nice thing to do, it doesn't resolve the cause for actual homelessness and this person continues to live an unstable life"

depression,fcyfzp8,t3_ejeyfi,1578079579.0,"You are not alone means that someone in this world is probably experiencing similar feelings including the exact same feelings you are feeling.

Anyways just my two cents."
socialskills,fcufea1,t3_eit9m4,1577979635.0,Thanks for writing this! I often struggle with knowing what to say and feel like I say the wrong things so it's helpful to know that there is no right or wrong thing to say. I've even written down a list of questions and topics to find something to talk about. Last night I went to a meetup group and I met this lady who I wanted to get to know better. I asked her if she is from the city or somewhere else and it took her a little while to respond so I felt kinda bad because I wondered if she was annoyed by the question. I later found out she's kinda an edgy person so I try not to take it to personally lol
SeriousConversation,fct8ukp,t1_fct0bg4,1577935969.0,"I agree with you and appreciate your post. Until I read the opening Reddit, I thought Reddit was a compassionate space for people who are hurting. I think the individual who wrote the opening Reddit believes life is fair and that the people who are experiencing loneliness deserve it for some reason which is laughable. I think it's important to be compassionate to other people's shortcomings because we all have them. But did the person who wrote this realize that maybe the people who are getting screwed over are super nice and kind which some reason attracts users and narcissist? That sometimes one's kindness goes unrewared and unseen? I left home hoping to find my own family where people were kind and enlightening. Now I am afraid my family is all too common and that small thinking abounds. I don't say this because I think I'm above anyone but I say this because I want to have empowering thoughts and beliefs, something that the masses of society don't believe. There is this idea that if something is popular or loved it must be good or right. This is not true at all."
AmItheAsshole,fco0p7s,t3_ei40zr,1577821987.0,"I don't think it's bad to not have social media. I am actually very impressed you didn't get sucked into it. I personally don't find it very rewarding and in fact often makes me feel terrible about myself. 

I met a guy randomly on a hike a few months ago. He lives in Minnesota and I asked for his IG just so we could stay more connected(already exchanged phone numbers) but he didn't have any social media. This was not a red flag for me. I told him i thought he was smart not to have it.

Although I have social media I'm only keeping it because I have several accounts linked to them. I find it very bad for my mental health because all of my ""friends"" seem to be living the good life while I've been struggling with a lot of problems. Makes me feel uber isolated. 

When I was looking for a roommate, I started to ask for peoples Instagram's or Facebook accounts. It's super revealing about people and their philosophy on life. Some of the things I saw and read shocked and disturbed me. 

Anyways just wanted to share my experience and thoughts on the matter."

depression,f8xmf4w,t3_e2gnrw,1574923933.0,This is a great idea. I have trouble sleeping and tend to over think things so maybe sleeping is a better way of coping and letting go. It sounds like you may sleep too much. Maybe try setting a timer and allowing yourself time to sleep and then making time to get up and do something else even if it's something really small.
funny,f74snjs,t3_dubozv,1573407399.0,I am in a Master's program and have been feeling so horrible. I never reealized that being part of a system of education justifies treating students poorly and making them feel horrible.

SeriousConversation,f6td9uk,t1_f6qumrd,1573147301.0,"I agree with what you are saying and I am glad you were able to really see the subtle hints in the post,  I feel that that is not so easy to do especially because it goes against going with the flow. I can definitely relate in this feeling of emptiness, especially in my current work. It's the strangest thing because I work for ""education"" but we are profit motivated. There is very little talk or concern about learning and adding value to society but more about making profits. I understand we need to make money but that seems to be leaderships only concern. They do not talk about the quality of the education, the difference we are making in people's lives, but rather did you make more money than you did last year? How many new programs did you push? I do not fit into this way of thinking, I want to make a difference, I want to provide value to the world and then because of the value I provide, I then will make money. I wish the people I worked with understood this but they don't despite having phd's, master's degrees, etc it seems there sense of community and humanity has been lost. It baffles me completely and I am learning to let go. Let go of trying to change people. For a long time, I fought it. I tried to convince them. And hard but I can't. They need to be open to new ideas but they have shut their minds and thus I am speaking to a wall. I write this to let you know that you are not alone because I too have many perks of my work but my values do not align with the values of my work and thus a feeling of disconnection results and maybe you are in a similar situation..."
depression,f53i80b,t1_f50n1nc,1571960078.0,"Wow thank you for writing this. That part about some of us being born or developing differently have to struggle. I think ive always been in denial about my issues I have both a disability no one can see and a deformity that I hide most of the time. I can gove off the perception of being normal but I have flaws that have led me to some pretty terrible rejections and hurts in my life. I feel shocked in a way to know that I am not alone, that other people hurt as I do and then i don't feel so alone anymore. And as you say we should stay just to piss off life. :-)"
depression,f53eab3,t3_dmmmem,1571959083.0,"I wish I could hug you too! I know what you mean sometimes I could really use a hug and some words of encouragement. Life can get so hard but it's important to remember that this too shall pass. Is there anything you can do that'll bring you some joy in the moment. Sometimes it's in knowing that we're not alone, that everybody hurts in someway. I noticed you said that you are watching your friends get everything they want while you are not. I can totally relate to that feeling and way of thinking but eventhough I struggle with truly believing this other people suffer just as much if not more than we do. This may sound odd but this was truly liberating for me because I didn't feel so alone. Often times people hide their pain or we don't notice it because we are in pain. I hope this helps to remind you you are not alone :-)"
dating_advice,f4uhp82,t3_dlf3t6,1571811115.0,"I think it's great that you have the courage to open up and share your thoughts and feelings. I think that dating takes time and you are not ugly. Just because you feel that way doesn't make it true. Sometimes we can get into a negative funk and then interpret everything that happens to us negatively. You need to take care of yourself mentally, physically, and spiritually. You should know that you're a great guy and you have a lot to offer. Also, being shy and unsure of yourself is ok. We all feel that way sometimes and lots of people don't mind at all. There will be women who love you just the way you are."
SeriousConversation,f4roj82,t1_f4rke52,1571770125.0,"Thank you! Yes it feels liberating and scary at the same time- To just let go and follow my bliss in a responsible manner of course :-).

SeriousConversation,f4rgxs4,t1_f4r140j,1571767362.0,"I love this idea. Great to plan breaks and ""me time"". This is something I have repeatedly failed to do, I become overly ambitious and although I sometimes stick to the plan I only become more and more depressed and stressed. I never quite figured out why. I had been living in a depressed state for so long. It's like my world was black and white and all I wanted to do was see color. I started listening to Tony Robbins again (I don't agree with everything he says, but somethings are spot on) and he said something that really struck me and that's we need to find the ecstasy in the moment in order to be happy fulfilled and have energy. I have been pushing myself thru ""self improvement"" for so long I had forgotten to really enjoy and prioritize myself. I have been recently experiencing this in my Master's program. The whole idea was to improve my life and have economic growth but I hate it, I am absolutely miserable. The instructors are terrible, demanding, and I have paid $2000+ for these courses and I don't feel like I am learning or gaining much from them. So if I apply what TR says, this program is draining me of my happiness and energy and won't help me to achieve my goal. Sry for the long post, just wanted to share my experience in case it might help you"

depression,f4pcsr5,t3_dl9rnl,1571724273.0,"I feel you. I feel frustrated, angry, and hopeless when I've put sooo much into my friendships and relationships and I get nothing back. Like recently my new roommate moved in and I tried so hard to be nice and accommodating to her but when she went out for 4th of July fireworks and saw that I was alone she didn't even offer to invite me. Then at work there's this super mean lady who everyone is nice to and does her bidding. While I'm nice and try to help people but I just get their snares. I feel that people and relationships have different layers. Work and acquaintances are more surface level friends so I try not to put too much of my heart into it. There will only be a few ppl that i can really feel loved by"

I have a very active imagination and can find myself automatically day dreaming about guys I'm into too creating love stories in my mind. I thought that this was bad too for awhile and it doesn't help when my life experience turns out to be different but there is something very healing about the imagination. I was reading a book called, ""The Body Keeps the Score"" about how people can heal after traumatic experiences and one takeaway was that imagining a better life than the one in someone's current experience is a way of healing. In the book, the author discusses how people with PTSD have trouble with imagination and cannot imagine a better life than the one they are living which impedes them from healing. I found this very enlightening because a lot of times day dreaming gets a bad rap but it's a gift that helps us through tough times also. :-)"
