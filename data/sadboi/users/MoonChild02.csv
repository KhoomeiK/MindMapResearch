One by one, nurses got coronavirus at a Silicon Valley hospital while management kept quiet

SAN FRANCISCO — 

 

The first to get sick was a woman in the nurse staffing office, who died in mid-March after a girls’ trip to Las Vegas with some hospital colleagues.

A nursing manager fell ill next, followed by a nurse on the night shift and then a day supervisor. A short time later, a day shift nurse went out and then a temp.

At the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, the nurses on a second-floor medical-surgical unit kept the grim tally in furtive texts and emails: Six women who had worked on their ward or visited it in the course of their duties had developed [symptoms of the coronavirus](https://archive.fo/ZldrN). Four reported testing positive, one had yet to be tested and one was dead.

Yet from the hospital administration, the worried employees said they heard nothing about what appeared to be an outbreak of the virus within the hospital’s walls. There was no official acknowledgment of the cases, and nurses who shared phone headsets, computer keyboards and a tiny break room were not tested, according to interviews and correspondence reviewed by The Times.

The frustration boiled over this week with an anonymous whistleblower complaint to Santa Clara County, which runs the hospital.

“Management is not communicating confirmed positive cases — information that would enable potentially-exposed/infected staff to take extra precautionary measures to not affect their loved ones at home and elsewhere,” stated a complaint signed, “employees not treated responsibly from within.”

The hospital’s compliance office has now launched an investigation.

A spokesman for the county health system, Maury Kendall, said in a statement that “some of our healthcare workers have tested or will test positive for COVID-19 and are out sick.” He said, though, that administrators were unaware of any deaths in the hospital ranks from the virus and declined to answer specific questions about the administration’s handling of the situation in the 2 Medical ward.

“We cannot comment on pending investigations, or on personnel matters, except to say that we dispute the allegations presented,” Kendall said.

Silicon Valley has been one of the [hardest-hit parts of California](https://archive.fo/ZldrN) with Santa Clara County reporting more than 1,440 confirmed cases and 47 deaths. Of the confirmed cases, 109 have been healthcare workers, according to state data. Valley Medical Center, the region’s flagship public hospital, has cared for a wave of COVID-19 patients.

The 2 Medical unit was not a designated ward for coronavirus patients, but nurses were trained in infection protocols for virus patients and some with suspected or confirmed cases ended up receiving treatment there.

The staffer who died, who was the first known widely to have symptoms, worked on another floor of the hospital, but she had frequent contact with the unit staff as part of her job, according to interviews with four employees, the whistleblower report and a written complaint to the president of the nurses’ union. The employees spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying they feared retaliation.

The 50-year-old woman was a close friend of a unit nurse on the night shift, and the pair had gone with other colleagues to Las Vegas in the middle of March, co-workers said. The trip occurred after local officials, alarmed about coronavirus cases cropping up in the community, had urged residents to stay home when they were sick and warned against nonessential travel.

Shortly after the staffer came back from Nevada, she developed symptoms of the virus and was admitted to a Kaiser Permanente hospital.

Her death March 19 stunned many in the hospital, including on 2 Medical.

“I was on my shift and I got a text message and I was like, ‘Oh, my God! [The staffer] died,’” a nurse recalled.

The staffer’s husband did not return messages seeking comment, but a nurse who is in contact with her family said the woman was suspected of having COVID-19 and was in an isolation unit when she died.

Her colleagues put up fliers summoning co-workers to a short memorial service at the hospital and her friends encouraged donations to a charity she supported, but there was no official communication to the nursing staff, according to the whistleblower complaint and interviews.

Within a few days of the staffer falling ill, the nurse manager of 2 Medical had a fever and went on sick leave. She later told her nurses in an email that she had tested positive, according to interviews and the complaints to the whistleblower and the union.

In the same period, a night shift nurse who had cared for a patient suspected of having COVID-19 started experiencing body aches and chills and later a fever. She called in sick and went to see her primary care doctor, who tested her for the virus, according to a union representative she consulted. In late March, the results came back positive, the representative said.

A manager told her that the suspected patient had tested negative, the union representative said. “She was told, ‘You contracted it in the community … you didn’t get it from the patient.”

Her father, with whom she lived, also got the virus and is now in an intensive care unit, the union representative said.

By then, nurses on 2 Medical had grown worried. There was no way to stay 6 feet from each other at the nurse’s station. At meals, the staff — sans masks — sat close to one another around a small table. The work was often communal as well.

“If we need help putting a Foley catheter, how are we supposed to do social distancing if the other nurse is holding the patient’s leg?” one nurse said.

The spokesman for the county hospital system said there are “robust cleaning processes” in place and that “our healthcare workers must practice social distancing at work where possible, including in the break rooms, meeting rooms, and other locations. “

On the weekend of March 21, an assistant manager on the unit called in sick, but she opted to return to work on Monday while still feeling poorly, according to interviews and the complaints.

As described in the whistleblower complaint, the assistant manager “made her own determination and communicated to others in management that the unit ‘needed her help’ and subsequently returned to active work...in spite of continued symptoms.”

Over the next week, the assistant manager worked a half-dozen shifts. She continued feeling ill and ultimately tested positive earlier this month, according to whistleblower and the union complaints.

She “was seen throughout this last week, on the unit, meeting with traveler nurses in close face-to-face contact while not wearing a mask,” one nurse wrote to the union president.

The assistant manager could not be reached for comment. The spokesman for the county health systems, Kendall, said in a statement that the hospital “requires everyone, including our healthcare workers, to be screened for fever and influenza-like illness symptoms before entering any of our patient care facilities.”

“We require that everyone wear surgical masks while in the hospital, clinic, or building where patient care or patient services are provided, and we require that all healthcare workers self-monitor for influenza-like illness symptoms and stay home (and notify their manager) if they have any such symptoms,” he wrote.

After the assistant manager was diagnosed, a nurse on the day shift then became ill and tested positive and one of the traveler nurses, brought in from out of state to help with understaffing, also developed COVID-19 symptoms and is out sick, according to the whistleblower complaint and interviews.

Still, there was no communication from hospital administrators. On Monday, the email detailing the problems on 2 Medical was sent to the county.

“The Hospital has not implemented any communication methods to alert those who may have interfaced with individuals who have been confirmed positive,” the email stated.

In his statement, the county spokesman said administrators “understand this is a very stressful time for our staff, particularly those who are on the front line caring for patients.”

“We truly appreciate and care deeply about all of our healthcare workers and remain committed to doing everything possible to ensure they are supported and safe,” he wrote.

I would get a letter of intent to purchase to anyone calling, connect them with the local/county/state/federal treasury to get proof of monetary funds, and then have them call first thing in the morning.

Something like that. But the red tape has to be cut somewhere. But I really don't actually know how. I just know what that article says, that our system here in the US isn't set up to deal with how medical systems get their supplies, and get it in times of high demand."

Nope. [This is why we don't have masks here.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2020/03/30/i-spent-a-day-in-the-coronavirus-driven-feeding-frenzy-of-n95-mask-sellers-and-buyers-and-this-is-what-i-learned/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) The brokers connecting buyers and sellers of medical equipment need two things: a letter of intent to purchase and proof of funds. The people our government has calling the brokers don't have either of those things, because they just get a directive. They're unequipped because they don't know how the system works, and our government is overly complex and bureaucratic to work with and through. Other countries know how medical brokers work, and have the letter and proof of funds ready to go. So, while the customers our government sends have to work through the bureaucracy of our government, others don't. 

Masks and other PPE are not being sent to just China, but to anyone who has all of their information ready to go, whether it be China, France, Italy, Japan, etc."

CoronavirusUS,fm6dvul,t1_fm64w9g,1585791899.0,"It sounds like you're being sensible about it.

Hoarding is when you buy out the whole shelf, which some people have been doing. That's what's causing the chaos. Buy only what you absolutely need for the next one to two weeks. 

For example, don't buy a whole shelf of Quilted Northern, a family of 5 doesn't need more than one of the big 12 packs for a week.

Ration. Make sure people in the household know to only use what they need.

Make sure everyone knows to not wad the toilet paper. My friend taught her daughter that four squares at a time is enough. If you need more, take another four (I know it's hard, ladies. I'm a woman, too, and am adhering to this). Don't use half the roll like my aunt does.

Cereal boxes tell you the amount used in a serving, so measure out those servings. 

Don't take the whole shelf of soap. A dime size amount should be enough for one use, and one soap refill bottle should last at least a couple of weeks. 

One bottle of spraying Lysol or Clorox should last a couple weeks. 

One of those 3-packs or one of the large canisters of Clorox or Lysol wipes should last at least a couple weeks. If need be, cut them in half.

With toothpaste, you should only use a pea-sized amount, not the amount used on the commercials.

Tissue, I'm not going argue on, being that, with my family's allergies, we go through one of those three-packs in about one week during the spring (yes, we all take allergy pills *and* nasal spray, but it's bad). Just don't hoard the whole shelf. Buy one 3-pack at a time.

Just use common sense. If you're buying an entire shelf, or even half a shelf, you're hoarding. Leave some for others - and not just one or two of an item, unless that's all that's left on the shelf. Even if the shelf is full, only take one or two packages of something. You don't need more than that at a time, unless you maybe have a large family.

Edit: Thanks for the award!"

This is the same reason you cannot point your gun at another person in California unless you are an officer of the law. That is not a restriction on your 2nd Amendment freedom. Why do you think *temporarily* shutting down gun stores to save lives is?

Guns are ***not*** essential to living, unless you live in a forest to hunt or on a ranch. Even then, there are other ways to order your bullets. Gathering in public places will kill people, and put other's lives at risk.

Let's put it this way: churches are closed because they are considered non-essential businesses. You can practice your religion freely, but going outside and gathering in groups will kill people. This is not a restriction on anyone's 1st Amendment rights.
