It’s sad but there’s a reason serial killers go for the homeless most often, there is nobody to care or notice that they’re gone. If a family member or friend went from texting/calling you everyday to being completely silent for a couple weeks it would be extremely concerning whether they’re in lockdown or not."

UnresolvedMysteries,fod163q,t1_foay9ly,1587678571.0,"Most people don't know how easy it is to get lost like that until it happens. One night I was on my way to a party where my friends were, but I had never been out there so I turned my GPS on and on my way I was. About 40 minutes later of driving, my phones GPS tells me I'm at my destination if I turn left.. Well, left was a forest. There were no houses anywhere, no lights, and I was on a 1-way gravel road to who knows where.

I had no choice but to keep following this road because there was literally nowhere to turn around, and eventually my malfunctioning GPS and cell phone service cut off. A this point, I was extremely frustrated and realized I was fucked. It's so dark I could barely see anything, and I didn't have much gas left, but I still had no choice but to keep driving in the direction I was going and hope I came up on something. Eventually I found a normal road and an auto shop and had cell service again so I could both call someone and look at a legitimate map to figure out how to get back home, but wow was it scary. 

One could very easily get in a situation like that and get stuck in the middle of nowhere, especially if they are intoxicated. Even being completely sober, the darkness and confusion will throw you off."

Pedophilic or not it’s clearly a symbol for something, and intentionally photoshopped in there. It’s impossible to bend ones fingers like that, and it’s clearly not a long exposure/distorted picture.

Depending on how much he really has makes the answer to his question here different imo. If he has a truly absurd amount of money perhaps paying the 5 grand to be able to stay in his hometown has more benefits than saving a few grand and moving far away. It could be like leaving your family behind to save pennies.

That being said on the opposite side, as another comment stated, with that kind of money you can pretty much fly endlessly back to your hometown whenever you want.

Really depends on how much money he has and how attached to his hometown he really is."

Coronavirus,fnwsq0c,t1_fnw8ip9,1587324697.0,"You would be surprised at how bad stores inventories are even in-store, let alone if they tried to extrapolate that onto a website.

This is just one example, but I've worked with a company that has easily spent millions of dollars on a pretty complex inventory system. It's not accurate even with constant upkeep and fixing from employees. You may scan something that has no stock in the store and it'll tell you there's 12 on the shelf, or there may be something that is completely full and the balance on hand will be -5.

This is for a few reasons - glitches in the software, theft, the warehouse sending stuff or not sending stuff but counting it in the inventory system, cashier mistakes, etc. There are a lot of places for error.

It would be essentially impossible to give an accurate inventory on a website when there is not even an accurate inventory in the store. Before the jump to website inventory happens, stores have to figure out how to keep an accurate rolling inventory. That's probably why you don't see any stores attempting the website route yet."
AskReddit,fnwnz6z,t1_fnwnogb,1587322038.0,"My issue was very similar. Eating is a temporary, albeit very effective stress reliever. It's so easy to get into the habit of using food as a crutch.

Peanut butter was my crack lol."
AskReddit,fnwl0lf,t1_fnwheut,1587320406.0,"Yep.

Don't get me wrong, healthy food tastes good too. But it's not the same kind of tasting good. There's a reason why people get so addicted to junk food that it basically kills them.

Especially if you really just enjoy eating, staying healthy is an every day conscious choice that not everyone wants to make. I was obese at one point in my life. If I didn't start making myself exercise and eat reasonably every day I would probably be 300lbs. You have to weigh whether feeling good, looking good and living longer are more or less important than eating whatever you want."

Young healthy guys basically feel invincible, that's why they tend to do the most stupid stuff out of all other groups.

It's like renting indefinitely vs buying a house in cash, the monthly payments are cheaper than buying the weights/equipment for home but over time (and not much time at those obscene prices) you blow past what it would've costed to straight up buy yourself a gym lol. My gym is $10 a month, 24hrs and pretty large and even then sometimes I consider just buying my own equipment and throwing it in my basement.

Also saying you only want to avoid poor people is quite conceded lol. I'm sure a lot of the people at the ""poor"" gyms make just as much or more than you."

Do you know how many people I know that are without a job and 0 savings yet they're out blowing money on new TV's, weed and airpods? The +600 unemployment benefit + recurring stimulus (which they are already talking about sending more out) is enough to keep the average autistic American blowing money on things they can't afford and that they never needed in the first place, until they can get their job back.

I know it's a meme but the government may actually be able to print their way out of an absolute disaster and in to a mild disaster.

The American consumer base also has a short term memory. People don't give a shit that our government runs a pedophile ring, bombs countries for fun and is friends with Russia as long as they can eat their Tyson tendies with extra BBQ sauce. People were already protesting the stay at home order by *blocking a fucking hospital*.
