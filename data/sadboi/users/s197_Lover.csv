mentalhealth,fcb32so,t1_fcb1lud,1577581673.0,I dont think your losing him. If you have the connection you say you do he will always be there. Times change and relationships change. You never know what could happen this time next year
mentalhealth,fcb0p57,t1_fcayp1r,1577580375.0,"Happy to read your response, it was heart warming. I'm in a great place now, I just felt my story could show some men that it is okay to let your guard down and be vulnerable. 

I hope your well as well, take care!"
mentalhealth,fcb0j4n,t1_fcb06t5,1577580271.0,"You might not want to hear this part but to me, it sounds like you have grown alot as a person. You seem to be handling your life very well and are ready to move forward and be healthy....

...unfortunately you cant save everyone. And as much as it is painful, it doesnt make you a bad person that he refuses help."
mentalhealth,fcaxxqu,t1_fcaxg6p,1577578806.0,"Honestly, convincing him he needs to open up is going to be really hard. Hes a service man, he has machismo drilled into his brain and overcoming that will be the challange. 

Your shared trauma that you talked about may have been a catalyst for this recent trauma being a bigger issue. 

Maybe you could suggest something like group therapy, where ""you need him to be there for you"" while you talk about your shared trauma. This could slowly get him adjusted to the idea of talking to someone while masking it as support for you."
mentalhealth,fcax24b,t1_fcawwqp,1577578310.0,Is he still in service or out now? Only reason I ask is because if he is still in service his fear of opening up could be because he does not want to get discharged.
mentalhealth,fcaviim,t1_fcav6c9,1577577434.0,"No, happy to answer.

Anger is definitely something I felt after what happened. Everyone deals with stress differently so its entirely possible that's where its coming from. Soldiers go through alot and it's difficult for us to understand it unless we served as well. 

Maybe you could try approaching your brother when he is calm about it, maybe over drinks if your old enough. I would try to be as positive about it as possible if you do go to bring it up.

This post has really blown up so I'm sure there will be some other opinions as well.

Hope your well!"

mentalhealth,fcany4c,t1_fcamhwa,1577573033.0,"100% agree. 

Happy new year!"
mentalhealth,fcalcyw,t1_fcakyqu,1577571512.0,"Agreed. I believe that there are stigmas for every gender when it comes to mental help but men are generally expected to just not have problems. Happy to see that there are people that agree, and are willing to comment about it.

Wish you the best, happy new year!"
mentalhealth,fcac16i,t1_fcabrtx,1577566482.0,"I can only imagine brother. It is a big step to be able to even post a brief comment like that, let alone open up about it. 

Men struggling with issues of mental health and abuse go un noticed. Hopefully the few that are willing to try and normalize this can save the rest from their pain. 

Wish you well my friend and hope your growing and prospering!"
mentalhealth,fcaab9o,t1_fca9wlx,1577565555.0,"To segway from that, part of what I tried to hint at is it doesnt change you to struggle with something. It doesnt mean you're weak, it means you need help. It is okay to ask for help.

Wish you the best, thx for the comment!"
mentalhealth,fca6t0m,t1_fca5r36,1577563908.0,"I guess the reason I shared this is because I pretended it didnt affect me for so long. I pretended I was okay until i could have been too late. Everyone handles something differently and i hope by hearing this it could wake someone up and give them the confidance to speak to someone. 

Much love, wish you the best!"
mentalhealth,fca0j4v,t3_eguu0u,1577560988.0,"Have you ever given thought to therapy as well as seeing a general practice doctor? 

Trust me however, this will not be the first time someone has been nervous to talk to a doctor. I'm sure you could imagine all the crazy, unique situations that doctors see. They are trained and taught to be understanding and non judgemental. If your doctor keeps a nurse in the room while talking to you, you can kindly ask for the room to your self if your more comfortable. 

With your parents, you're over 18. Legally they cant get to your records.

Wish you the best, post an update so we can root for you!"
mentalhealth,fc9xva7,t3_egufvo,1577559831.0,"Making the decision to talk to someone saved me. It's not easy. Its embarrassing at times. But you're doing the right thing and you'll thank yourself for in in time.

Wish you well!"

Wish you well!"
mentalhealth,fc9ubuu,t3_egu7m1,1577558335.0,"Hey,

I'm 24 and just went back to school to finish. Moved back home with my parents, the whole shebang. Dont let anyone tell you living with your parents is wrong, if someone judges you for that get them out of your life.

In regards to school loans, think of them like a car payment not a student loan. When you graduate live within your means and work hard to pay them off. Alot of the stories you hear of people paying for 20 to 30 years to pay it off is because they spend like 50 bucks a month on their payment.

As far as what's the point? 23 isnt too late! It isnt for me and it isnt for you! You are doing something to better your future. Your situation is the now and your working for the future. It's scary because you never know what itll bring but trust me if you finish college now in 20 years you'll thank your self!"
