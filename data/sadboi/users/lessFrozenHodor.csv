I've always been an insecure person, constantly doubting my abilities, and the last few years weren't too kind on me. So yes, I can relate how much loneliness and being overlooked hurts and I'm sorry you're going through this.

I couldn't take it anymore, so I decided to quit my studies and take some time off for myself to figure things out. It took some time, thinking alone in my room and a lot of conversations with friends and family, but now I have a clear plan for my future.
