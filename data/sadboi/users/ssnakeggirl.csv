BipolarReddit,fr3ergc,t1_fr3cmqg,1589855843.0,"I'm similar - in between episodes I feel very ""normal."" It's still bipolar, we both have more ""classic"" symptoms in that sense. Lithium works well for me too. It's not quite enough but it's a huge help. I don't know why lamictal was so bad for me, it made me more anxious and I think more manic. But my doctor told me it can happen, I know it's not just me. I think the sudden increase in mania is alarming! 

You are the client & customer. You have a right to participate in your care, voice your concerns, and be heard. That doesn't mean you get to pick what treatment you get but you certainly get a vote! They should explain why they prescribe every medication and the risks/benefits.

I had access to alcohol as a child, it wasn't locked up, it was in the house - I never drank it! These aren't teenagers. This is really abnormal and unsafe. What if that child develops alcoholism in elementary school? Please call CPS. I doubt you know the full extent of it, but if a young child feels driven to drink it's a sign of other problems."

Sometimes you find out that someone lost a parent young, or survived a suicide attempt, or was abused as a child. People who look so happy and successful often have very dark parts of their life.

That's exactly the goal - people are going to make their own decisions at the end of the day, but it's also important to realize that many people won't or can't do their own research and to back up claims. The bigger the claim the more I want to see their evidence."
BipolarReddit,fr29f4c,t1_fr28cw5,1589833420.0,"I don't mean to be unkind, I'm just a little bit frustrated. I mean for one thing this is my work day, I'm taking a little bit of time here and there to check reddit on breaks, but I don't have the ability to go into this as deeply as I'd like as I'd like to and I'm on my phone. It doesn't help that my actual work for today is also very frustrating!

I don't like being cursed at. I don't like someone telling me that I should find the information for myself and then complaining about the information that I found. I'm trying to explain why I think the study is limited anyway because I know other people may read this. It's good information, it's good because it can get people interested in the topic so they might do a bigger study later. However it is not definitive and I don't want anyone getting the idea that they can medicate themselves with CBD. Part of this is because the dose in the study is much higher than what most people can even afford to take. Part of it is because the study just doesn't show very much. 

You can want something to be true very badly but that doesn't mean that we should ignore evidence. I really wish this were true. So many people would be living happier lives if it were true. Sadly we need to wait for the results of larger human studies."
BipolarReddit,fr26p8e,t1_fr25p6l,1589832078.0,"It's not how it works. Don't start if by saying that because there aren't other studies this hasn't been disproven. In science we have to prove that something is true. You can't just say it's true and wait for someone to challenge you.

 The vast majority of information in this paper, that you linked me to, is on rats. They talk about a small human study at one point. The data from that study is inconclusive. That's unfortunately all we have right now. And yes I've been on antipsychotics the past eight years and I take one currently. I've also taken CBD which is legal in all 50 states and easily accessible, although somewhat expensive. The CBD dose used in that study is equivalent to 20 over the counter CBD pills. It's not cheap and accessible at that dose.

You keep glossing over the details, but details matter. Whether a study is done on humans or rats matters. The number of people in the study matters. The length of time of the study matters. The dose matters. What I can tell you is that I feel smart sharp and functional on my current medication, but I don't think I feel that way if I took 10 + CBD pills (starting dose is 200mg and they go up from there) I'm happy because I'm not currently experiencing any of the side effects you mentioned, I know they're real, I know they're common, but that does not mean that no one can find antipsychotics that work well for them. Most importantly the antipsychotic controls my moods efficiently to allow me to work full time in my current position, which I absolutely love. 

We also have to remember that the study is about schizophrenia, not mood stabilization."
BipolarReddit,fr22jdq,t1_fr20vo7,1589830049.0,"There were only 42 (or two groups of 35, depending on the part of the study, still very small) people in the study and it is the only study that was performed on humans and to not rats. Most CBD that sold over the counter is approximately 20 mg. This study started people on 200 mg then moved up. That's a dose 10+ times what most people would take and it is completely financially inaccessible to the average individual given the high cost of CBD.

This is also a short-term study. It's completely possible that these people just felt stoned out of their minds. Yes I know CBD isn't what makes you stoned but the dose likely to be a little bit different when you're taking 10 times the amount as your starting dose.

I don't find this compelling because I'm a scientist who works with very large and very small data sets all of the time. What I can tell you is that looking at these statistics I would toss this out. The power (ability to tell if you should reject the null hypothesis or if a result is an error, basically, ability to tell if there is something going on) is very low when you have small samples. If I were building a model with this kind of information and this small of a sample size I would conclude that I could not based on this evidence determine if there is a significant difference between the groups. That doesn't mean that they're at least as good as each other. It means we simply don't have enough data. Please know that this is exactly what the researchers concluded. They did not say CBD is as good as antipsychotics.

 I would not feel comfortable moving forward with these kinds of results due to the extremely small sample size, the abnormally high dose, and the fact that they don't measure all possible impacts that these medications might be having. What it comes down to is 35 people had results for a short period that were similar to another 35 people's results. That's it.

What is also interesting is that no one from NIH in their review article thinks this is compelling either. They know something you don't - which is that extremely small medical studies have very abnormal results all the time that are later  unable to be replicated. Honestly I hope it's true, I think it'd be great if CBD could be used this way. But we have no reason to believe that right now and it's really irresponsible to imply that we do. 

This is exactly why we ask people to cite sources. I think we both would have saved a lot of headaches if we started off by talking about the same study.

Edit - I'm sorry, I know this is a lot. This is part of what I do for a living and it's something I care a lot about. There's a huge difference between saying that something was seen in a study and saying that that same thing can be extrapolated to the general population. An example is that I could roll a dice four times and get the number one each time. The likelihood of this happening is (1/6)^4. You would have to conclude that there was a 100% incidence of rolling the number one. You would not want to conclude that you will always roll the number one whenever you roll any die ever. You're simply summing up what happened in this experiment. You're saying that both regimens seem to help a reasonably well. That doesn't mean that both regions would work the same way in the real world. There isn't enough power in those tests to make that conclusion because the data isn't clear enough and the sample is too small. This happens in science all the time. I am not a biomedical researcher but I often write up something along the lines of ""although p<0.05, the small sample size does not allow us to distinguish between these groups at this time."" Not to mention that you want to establish if the distribution is close enough to the normal distribution for these to be the right comparisons, etc."

BipolarReddit,fr1yh3p,t1_fr1uu4q,1589828078.0,I've actually seen that before. I also got drug tested when I entered a psychiatric practice once. doesn't seem to be standard and I don't agree with it but it's not totally out of whack either. I think they're concerned that they could prescribe something that would interactively badly with something that you're taking on your own. Personally I believe in harm production so I would never tell someone that they can't or shouldn't get help with their also smoking weed or doing any other drug. But I am also not a psychiatrist and I'm not worried about anyone suing me.
BipolarReddit,fr1xjpi,t1_fr1wlbu,1589827618.0," I'm a moderator on a subreddit (here!) that asks people to provide links to research when they make claims about medical efficacy. You're the one making the claim then you are the one who should provide the link. I was kind and I decided to go look it up myself. You don't like what I found. That's unfortunate, but it's not my fault and it is not because I'm asking you to do my work. It is significantly easier for everybody if the person making the claim also provides the evidence. I don't think this evidence is compelling. I've explained why I don't think this evidence is compelling very clearly, which is that there was not a significant difference between the two groups and the was very small. If you read the full article the researchers explain why they don't think their results are significant and they want more data."
BipolarReddit,fr1wg8x,t1_fr1vrxv,1589827082.0,"No, I was looking at the NIH review article because it appears to be the most definitive source on this subject. I asked you what study you looked at and you told me that I should find it myself, so I did my best. It's absurd expect me to spend hours researching a claim that you made and provided no evidence for.

Edit - NIH review is #1. NIH study is #2. 

I continued reading and I saw that there are human subjects. So in that respect I apologize. However there are only 42 human subjects. The fact that the vast majority of evidence is on rats or an extremely small study makes me think this is not currently well researched. NIH doesn't seem to think this study is compelling and I don't either. I think we have a responsibility to explain how much evidence we have before we tell people that CBD works better than antipsychotics. At the moment the amount of evidence is negligible. It would be great if they could study this further.

Edit - you should have read it until the end of the study. Even the researchers say that they can't prove whether or not it was helpful. They're also giving extremely high doses, starting at 200 mg. Can you explain what you think this study is saying? Next time please just link to it right away instead of complaining that I chose to look at a review article."

You are getting along well now because you haven't had any major friction. Trust me that's going to come. this is the honeymoon phase if your relationship. I would be really concerned if you were having a lot of friction at this point. Whether or not you can agree on how to raise a child in theory and whether or not you can agree when it's 2 in the morning and no one has slept in the past week or had any idea how to make rent or not the same thing.

Unfortunately the fact that you didn't have accommodations might work against you, but I still think it's worth a shot and it's a lot better than spending a lot of money and retaking the entire class. 

Her opinion is that this typos were bad enough to invalidate the entire paper. Your opinion is that it's a minor error. It makes sense to try to get a third opinion.

Dogtraining,fr1cox6,t3_gm0t16,1589817400.0,"We also haven't been able to take our dog out as much as we'd like due to the quarantine. He's about a year and a half old, very high energy, mixed breed. One thing we started doing is looking for any kind of empty field or open space, athletic fields, empty lots, etc. There's also a couple tiny little parks tucked away that most people don't know about. When we get there we clip on a 30-ft lead and let our dog run, play, and sniff. It seems to really calm him down. I also run with my dog almost every day but that's probably not an option at 7 months. Just walking on a short leash isn't as stimulating, it doesn't wear them out enough.

I don't think that just having a yard will solve the problem but it would at least give you some space and solve the noise issue. Definitely work on a quiet command! 

 You've got a very smart and very high energy dog who needs to have stuff to do. I agree that teaching tricks can be really fun for everyone. My dog recently learned how to ""go get"" things on command - go get your ball, go get your bone, etc. You can make little courses in your apartment. Up. Into the sofa, walk across, down off the sofa, around the table, sit on the rug, etc. 

 Playing on the floor with your dog can be a fun way to teach safe boundaries for play - you'll probably get nipped in the beginning but the idea is to teach the dog NOT to do that and to play nicely. You want to work on building up excitement then ramping it back down and helping your dog relax."

Deciding to behave childishly is not going to help you get a better grade the second time around, all it's going to do is ensure that you fail again. If you think the gradevis unfair you have the ability to appeal it within your academic department and you should do so.

I think you also need to realize that that the other alternative is that she actually did think you work was sloppy, possibly because bipolar disorder is keeping you from doing your best. It happens.

BipolarReddit,fr16a02,t1_fr0y4ei,1589814055.0,"I really think you need to talk to your doctor, possibly a different psychiatrist. I really doubt that what you experienced was actually lithium toxicity. It seems significantly more likely that you were overheated and dehydrated, which can happen to anyone, but is much more likely in people who take lithium. I also think that you would probably notice when you start to feel bad before it gets to this point once you're aware that it's a problem. Again, for me, the first summer that I took lithium was rough and I felt sick a lot, but it almost never happens now because I know that I need to drink a lot of water and take breaks sometimes. I'm still able to do all the things that I like, including running in hot weather and hiking long distances in hot weather, I just bring a shit ton of water. I'm not a doctor and I don't want to tell you to go against doctors advice, but I don't think this situation was fully explained and I think your doctor might be misunderstanding what happened or not I ommunicating well. You didn't describe any of the core symptoms including a high level, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, organ damage, etc. Tremor is a common side effect even at normal levels. They also didn't do any of the core tests such as a lithium blood level, an EKG, blood chemistry, urine testing, or other tests to assess kidney function. Your dose was not changed - the accomodations sounds like they are for over heating. 

I also have no idea what happened if you got sick on the job, so I don't want to give any advice about that. All I'm saying is that it's very normal for someone who takes lithium to overheat and feel sick. In my experience when this has happened to me all I have to do is have something to drink like water, iced tea, etc and take a break. I've never sought emergency medical care but I did discuss it at my next appointment. This is why I have a big expensive day pack and a small but expensive running vest... Three hydration bags, two collapsible flasks, and countless water bottles. It's very very important for us to stay hydrated if we are outside in the summer heat. A big hat helps too, as does a white t shirt to keep the sun off our face, neck, and back.

Bottom line is that if you're getting sick enough to be pulled off the job and taken to get medical care you also need to be getting a blood level to make sure you're okay. It would be really terrible if you actually were toxic for prolonged periods of time and no one was even checking. I really really think this deserves a long conversation with a doctor to figure out what happened, why they didn't do a blood test, and what you need in the future to stay healthy. HR at your job isn't a good source for that, their job is to protect the company. You should talk to someone like your GP, your psychiatrist, a different psychiatrist, maybe even an endocrinologist. This just makes no sense to me."

It's really common to get hot and dehydrated if you take lithium. When it happens to me I drink water and rest indoors. I also try to prevent it by carrying water with me, sometimes in a running vest or a backpack.

Maybe ask your psychiatrist for more information on what happened and what you need to do? Drinking cool water might help."
BipolarReddit,fqzdha2,t3_glh5w8,1589765074.0,"I think what I actually really just did not expect was that one day I'd be stable. I was so used to taking medications that only kind of helped for that made things worse. obviously a lot of that was because of misdiagnosis, but I didn't really expect that it actually feel good at the end of the day. It took a while but I got there.

Depakote and lithium are both common mood stabilizers that may help you. It's also common for doctors to prescribe atypical anti-psychotics. You may have heard of abilify, latuda, or vraylar, which are sometimes advertised on TV. There's a huge amount of medications in this class and they all have slightly different side effects. I would expect that it might take some time to find a good medication or a combination of medications. but I would also expect that you might start to feel at least a little bit better somewhat quickly.

Good luck! Take care of yourself, get enough sleep, get some fresh air sunshine and exercise. Stuff like adding stressors to your life, staying up late, alcohol and drugs are not going to help. Reach out to the people around you and make sure they know that they can come to you if they think you're behaving strangely. It's possible I think it'd be a good idea to talk to therapist who had  experience treating bipolar disorder. they can help you make sense of what's going on and figure out how to pattern your life in a way that's condusive to disability.

Unfortunately sometimes the problem is with us. 

I'm saying this is as someone who failed a required class and had a lot of problems late in her college career that required an extra semester. Although the good news is that I still moved on to have the life I wanted. I know it feels like the end of the world but taking one more class isn't the worst thing I could be happening.

I think ""distress tollerance"" really hit home. Sometimes you just have to feel bad and nothing will immediately make it better. Learning to live with that is really important. For her, that kind of deep pain lead to relapsing. Let's be honest nothing is going to help you with immediate intense pain the way heroin does. But you can learn to accept that pain instead of covering it up. I don't want to claim I know what her life is like, I don't know what the source of get pain is, etc. But I know DBT helps me see the light at the end of the tunnel and I hope it continues to help her too. I would recommend DBT for everyone because even if you are mostly mentally healthy it never hurts to have more tools available to you."

running,fqxi6lm,t3_gl9dia,1589732671.0,I really enjoy alternating between days when I run a certain distance straight through (usually about a 5k) with days where do it in intervals. It's nice to switch it up and intervals are less mentally intimidating. In usually run with my dog and I think he enjoys that he can sniff around if it's an interval day.
dogs,fqxaj0s,t1_fqx1n1r,1589728997.0,"I think part of the problem is that a lot of people don't manage the dog's behavior at all. They are willing to put up with a dog that jumps on them, nibbles on their fingers, barks all the time,  steals food, has accidents, etc, but other people aren't. It would be a good idea to make sure your dog understands how to be polite and behave well indoors if you have not already done so. It's going to eliminate a lot of problems. I love dogs but for me part of owning a dog is investing the time up front to teach my dog how to behave in a home so I don't spend the next 10-15 years dealing with unwanted behaviors. People are much happier to share space with a dog if the dog is well behaved, quiet, and clean. You may also want to tech your dog not to go into your roommates bedrooms uninvited. If there is anything they need to do, like not leaving food out, make sure they know to do that.

Have fun I think it will be fine. When I was in college my roommate had a lab. I didn't like the roommate but the dog was great!"

I have no idea if they are or not though."
dogs,fqx0igl,t3_glezg5,1589722821.0,I have a feeling your housemates are just going to be happy to have a dog. Dogs can really cheer everyone up and ready to stress.

dogs,fqx05sl,t3_glf3pr,1589722571.0,"If they are getting funding or trying to get funding from the city it might be worth contacting your local representative.

Idk, again, in not trying to say there are zero lonely old men who pay for non sexual companionship, just that it's going to be hard to find them in a sea of men who are pretending they will pay you companionship but expect sex. I don't want anyone getting in over their head or otherwise pressured into a sexual relationship they don't want. That the main issue for me, the lack of transparency. You need to know how many hours you are pouring into this and what's expected to know if it's doing you actually want to do.

* Peer support facilitated by a therapist

* Medications that reduce the urge to drink/use, medications that cause alcohol to make you sick, methadone management

* supervised injection, needle exchange, drug purity testing, and even prescribed opioid management, other risk management.

* Dialectical behavior therapy, individual therapy focused on sobriety, individual therapy for trauma, trauma group therapy, psychotherapy

* Psychiatric care for co-occuring conditions. The overlap between mental illness and substance abuse is huge.

* Housing support & Career support, parenting support. You are less likely to relapse when you have stuff to stay sober for and you don't feel like trash.

People have different needs. 

Edit: we also prescribe too many opiates to begin with! If you give people powerful addictive drugs for long periods of time of course they get addicted. The opiates cause a chemical dependancy. That person should never have been in that situation!"

When I went to an in person therapy group I wound up driving two girls to trader joes to stock up on cheap wine and snacks even though we had just been talking about how sobriety is important for stability. I think peer support is important but you need to be at a certain point yourself and be able to avoid situations like that. I like that NAMI has actual classes you can take to learn more about managing your condition.

Dogtraining,fqpx7gx,t3_gk6v1i,1589555622.0,"It's been my experience that most, if not all dogs don't like being moved from a comfortable space. It feels very invasive to them if you're trying to physically move them when they're resting or sleeping. What I do for my dog is use a couple commands related to getting him to move. So I can tell him to come to me, go to a place, get off something, etc. It's much more pleasant for everyone if I can convince him to do this with words versus dragging him around. Asking a dog to get up from a place where he's comfortable and move is a big ask, so make sure you give him a treat when he does it and make the second location as comfortable as you can. You also want to do this immediately, before the dog can get comfortable in the place where you don't want him to be.

I'm not sure this is either a behavioral or a medical issue. I think it's pretty normal for dogs to behave this way, and if you can find other ways to get them to move there really isn't a time where you're going to need to physically pick them up like that while they're sleeping or resting."

SJS can be fatal, it doesn't clear up on its own. If you think you have SJS you need to seek emergency care somewhere else. You should also call your psychiatrist and send them a photo for advice. A very good friend of mine got SJS a few years ago and within 2 days it went from a tiny bloch on one part of her body to a full body rash that was so painful. She sent photos of her every body covered in this. This isn't something you can self diagnose. It's not something you can self treat. It's a medical emergency.

The thing is, back then I just didn't feel connected to anything. There's nothing anyone could have said there's nothing anyone could have done I felt like I wasn't real and thus nothing mattered. Medication make something change, like a switch. I don't think my core beliefs changed. Who I am as a person didn't change. But suddenly simple things like the sun on my skin were enough to make life worth living.

Your brain is barely developed at 25. Maybe push it back a little and see if something changes."
