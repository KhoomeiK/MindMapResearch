I would let your attorney know not to go after something they know isn't achievable. Thus wasting your money. Sounds like your STBX is unstable and might need psych treatment and supervised visits until she's determined to be stable. You could always see if she will sign away her parental rights if you want to go that route. Otherwise you can be the custodial parent and you both share 50/50. Make sure everything is documented in divorce papers. Visitation schedules, how the Holidays and vacations will be handled. Doctor notifications etc etc. Moving out of state etc etc. The more you have documented the less you have to go back to family court wasting time and money for attorney fees. As other person said. It would be in your son's best interest to have his mother  in his life. Unless she is totally unfit. I suggest you and your son might need to go to a therapist and see how both of you are doing. Don't try to alienate your son from his mother if it's not warranted. You both should try to co- parent your son like grown adults. No fighting etc etc. Good luck."
