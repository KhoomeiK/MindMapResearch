I fully believe that if the movie had someone different playing the villain, it wouldn't have seen as much success as it did. If you take him out of it it's really a pretty cheesy, subpar horror movie, but the way that David portrays Art is fucking terrifying. It genuinely gave me anxiety the first few times i watched it. And you can compare that to the first movie the character Art was in, All Hallows Eve, where all though he was the most memorable part, the character had nowhere near as much impact and presence because he was played by a different actor. 

Say what you want about the movie itself, but I will come back and watch it again and again just because of David's amazing performance, and i'm siked for the release of the second movie."

She didn't even believe it, i had to lie and say it was school. She's said things before like ""oh what are you gonna go cut yourself"" to me as she screamed at me.

StopSelfHarm,fk9xcy2,t3_fhabb6,1583985949.0,"Hey there. I'm 16 rn and started cutting when i was around 11 as well, and i still struggle a lot to this day. I perfectly understand where you're coming from, and i know the feeling of not understanding why it's bad for you and not wanting to stop. I used to feel the same way, and recently I've been struggling with that thought process again. 

I promise you though, it is not worth it to indulge that addiction more than you have to. Especially while you're so young. My entire teenage years have been overclouded with all of these terrible memories that stem from this. It's not as harmless as your mind can trick you into believing it is. I promise. It's always healthier for your mind and body to find another way to cope with whatever problems may be causing you stress that isn't so damaging. Personally I've found that even though you get the temporary relief, overall your mental state crumbles very fast the more you self harm. And that can lead to physically very dangerous injuries. And I do not want to see that happen to you, internet stranger. You do not deserve to suffer with that. 

I sympathize with you deeply, and I hope you can kick this habit sooner than later. If you ever need someone to talk to, at all, my dms are open. Either way, im sending love your way. <3"

gatesopencomeonin,facgkcm,t3_e8gcab,1575939083.0,I saw this twice cause i follow a metalmemes hashtag on insta and everytime i was disgusted. Old boomer metalheads are the most annoying people ever.
StopSelfHarm,fa6fefn,t3_e7qvpu,1575824143.0,"I'd love this! This is genuinely so sweet of you :) 

My tastes lean towards rock and metal primarily but i do love some of the classics still like david bowie and Queen, im very open minded in general so, have fun with it!"
offmychest,f9w43zq,t3_e74rcq,1575686688.0,"I totally get this, personally though i think it depends on what genre. Im a huge horror movie fan, specifcally the cheesy, gorey b - grade movies that are so bad you can't not love them. In horror genres it's almost kind of just, part of the whole thing, especially in the above mentioned kind. If you get through a badly made slasher flick without at least a couple boobies on screen every chance they get, it just doesn't feel the same."

StopSelfHarm,f9lrp34,t3_e5qnas,1575430283.0,"This is a really neat idea that ive never actually heard of, but i have noticed having to spend time dealing with tools and such, like having to find a screwdriver to get to something or anything like that is a really effective way of letting my urges pass and honestly not much else works. This seems like a much more reliable form of that, so, thank you :)"
notliketheothergirls,f9idndw,t1_f9h0qyf,1575334530.0,"Fr, it's sad. I'm a teenage girl and i take a small amount of pride on being educated in music and older generations as a whole but that doesn't mean when i talk about it im putting other girls who aren't down or trying to be edgy. It's just something important to me. Nothing new in categorizing and pitting young girls against each other though :/"
notliketheothergirls,f9idfzo,t1_f9i5gfb,1575334383.0,"Sure, yeah, but he isn't a musician who's built a whole career on being so. And there's a lot of people her age who know and appreciate music from the 70's and other early generations. Some people might not care but, if you're a musician i feel like you should have at least heard of as influential of a band as van halen."
notliketheothergirls,f9ida96,t1_f9hpci3,1575334265.0,"Yes, thats exactly what i was getting at! I'm a pretty young musician myself and i do everything i can to be educated on influences and such. And that goes for any genre. All of them have their own ""classics"" who, really, if you're gonna be as big as she is, you should know at least the name of.  For example, i kind of hate the Beatles, but i will never discredit how influential they are and am still pretty educated on them. I just have no clue how someone can be a musician and not know classic artists."
notliketheothergirls,f9h08kx,t1_f9gzjrw,1575307306.0,"Exactly!! Like, if i met a dude who didn't know van halen or some other classic band i would probably have the same reaction as them. And that's just cause younger people, for the majority, don't appreciate classic music and it kinda sucks. It has nothing to do with trying to be quirky or different."
notliketheothergirls,f9gay59,t3_e4wasv,1575296384.0,"I mean tbh this doesnt even seem like a ""im not like other girls"" thing. It's just a jab at how (objectively) the younger generation's kind of oblivious to music legends like van halen. I think this is kind of a reach, even if you think it's an asshole-y thing to say, it's not about being ""not like other girls""."

Onision,f8t04l5,t3_e1r964,1574792903.0,"I agree. I was around 11? Maybe, when i started watching his videos. He was my favorite youtuber for a few years, but eventually it dropped off when the forums started to become more of a reaccuring thing on his channel. I was in it deep but luckily, social anxiety kept me from ever interacting. When the forums first became a thing i heavily considered submitting to them. That scares me to this day. The whole reason i attached myself to him so heavily was cause of his self harm videos. At that point in my life, i was self harming intensely and did not want to be alive. For some reason the brutal way he spoke about the subject got through to me and did, at the time, help. I think it was the fact that he claimed to be so honest and i didnt want to be looked at as weak by someone who i belived to be honest. I was offended initially everytime he made fun of it, but at the same time eventually i realized it made me stop. I think the way he shames young girls, many of them mentally ill, like myself, in his videos (or he used to anyway, i dont know what the fuck his videos are now) really contributed to his ability to groom so many girls. The fact that i could've easily ended up in a situation like sarah or regina makes me want to vomit."
