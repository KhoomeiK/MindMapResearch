[Astora Greatsword](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Dark-Souls-3/ds3_astorags.png) 

Guts used a lot of Great/UGS in the manga / 1997 Anime, and the Abyss Watcher armor is almost more a reference to post Eclipse Guts, after he loses his arm ( hence the metal gauntlet / shoulder pad )

Nameless knight / Herald would probably work better.

I only know this because I worked extensively on a golden age guts cosplay in ds3, and spent hours pouring over every sword.

Unfortunately there are not many that are directly similar to his sword, either too long and thin, or lacking the channel between the edges of the blade.

Cathedral Knight and Lothrick Knight GS have these channels but are way too heavy and thick, emtirely the wrong shape, same with the Greatsword ( Except for the ds1 and ds2 versions )

Best bet would be Astora, mostly because it swings fast and is lighter imo. 

Drakeblood also offers a similar look to Young Gut's sword."

I'd say I have decent genetics. 

I don't look bad. I have a little acne.


I have an extreme skin condition, where the skin of my fore arms, elbows, and behind my right ear dry and crust up.

I actually had gaping sores on my inner elbows from the skin splitting open.

I am underweight. Ive been skinny and thin my whole life. I'm about 5'11"".

I have trichtotillomania. Which is basically a self harm / ocd related disorder. It makes you enjoy pulling your hair out. It's basically like jerking off without pmo. But you're self harming. 

This lead to me being essentially bald from the age of 6 - 14. I would pull my hair every day. Relapse after a few months. Get my hair cut. Stop pulling as much. Relapse as soon as my hair grew back. 

When I was 14, and had just finished my freshman year of highschool, I started wearing hats. My stepdad gave me a hat from his work. I wore that hat for 3 fucking years. Guess what. I haven't relapsed. I think I've pulled my hair once in 3 years. I no longer have a 4 inch bald spot on the front of my head. 

All through out school I was spastic and borderline add. I would make noises, follow other kids around, draw all over my papers and tests. I was a decent student. I just acted out a lot. Lack of impulse control. Needless to say, between the constant balding, and my behavior, I got bullied constantly. I had a confusing and stressful homelife. Nobody liked me.

But I've been doing this NF thing for a few days. Even if it isn't proven to help, and it's just placebo, who cares? If it's placebo then it just means I needed a little more motivation to make myself feel better. 

I'm an internet addict. I spend about 12 hours a day on my phone. Average is like 8 - 10. It's 4:30 am rn. But I'm semi excited to be alive again. I fail constantly at everything. But I've been gluten and tomato free ( my allergy triggers ) for about a month now, and I've been NF for 3 days now. It's really not as hard for me, but just a few weeks ago it was just a normal thing I'd do several times a day. And the shame and the guilt still bugged me, and I'm not even religious.

I think it's just about wanting to better yourself. You don't have to better yourself if you don't want to. But I want to be a better person who can be better to other people."
