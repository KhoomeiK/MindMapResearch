Most of the pawn shops around my house sell all PS3 games for a flat $2. How can you beat that? Just hours of entertainment for bordering on free.
PS4Deals,fqpndfp,t1_fqnmv1t,1589550296.0,I'd honestly have been happier if they had included more games from last gen. There's a lot of PS3 games I still play. I feel like financially more PS3 games would've just made sense. Oh well.

PS5,fpvqrfk,t1_fpvjsl6,1588950099.0,"Kinda sorta. I can see a lot of things happening. The PS5 does have a boost mode for PS4 games. But, according to Sony that does not include all PS4 games. Cerny made the comment that they were testing the top 100 most popular PS4 games, and considering the PS4 has a huge library, 100 is kinda just scratching the surface. The PS4 Pro offers a boost mode for games that aren't Pro Enhanced, but example, FF15 on boost mode had a number of issues (Which might be fixed now). But at a given point the boost mode was worse than just playing it normally. Now I would say every PS4 game should benefit from the SSD.

PS5,fpp0ox6,t3_gei1wr,1588793922.0,"In reality, this being a thing largely is down to the publishers, not so much Sony, right? I mean, it isn't Sony's game to upgrade, unless it's 1st party of course. I'd say if companies are doing it for Xbox they're probably do it on all platforms. I think a lot of devs/publishers are in the position that they think their big releases that are still slated for current gen consoles will tank if they don't offer this. Since people may hold off until later to purchase a copy. They don't want the game to launch and not hit the needed sales goal."
PS4Deals,fpozoh4,t1_fpoy345,1588793420.0,"Right. I'm not trying to be argumentative, but I've seen this game sitting in the case at every major retailer for every platform since as long as I can remember. I'd say children's games largely don't need advertised because publishers can basically count on kids to find their way to the gaming isle and just see Paw Patrol and they're sold. There isn't really much persuading them. So like I said, not trying to argue just to argue. But I think we're riding different brain waves here."

Trophies,fpk0xol,t1_fpjona5,1588685731.0,"I'm about to finish my platinum on this. The only online trophy that can really be a pain is The Real Deal. You have to get MVP in three multiplayer matches. Which can be hard, because lots of people are really good, and well, you might be bad. I ended up cheesing it, which was still kinda tough. Do the takeover series matchmaking until you get one of two matches. If you get overrun, just bolt as soon as it starts and capture as many  campfires as you can. Don't even really bother to shoot anyone. Just keep sprinting to fires to capture and get as many as you can. The other is hostile territory. Just run and capture one base and just sit there. If you die run to another and just sit there. You will almost certainly get MVP by just holding the base down. I'm not great at competitive multiplayer, so this was tough for me to get in any timely fashion. The rest of them is just the good ole grind."

GameStop,fp9kz0y,t1_fp8wf38,1588428813.0,"I dont mind that you corrected me. I politely asked someone to correct me if I was wrong, because I wanted to be properly informed in the case that I was wrong. The last sentence of your comment was entirely rude and unesscessary. I got shitty because of that, not because you did what I asked. I frequent Gamestop pretty often and I actually take up for them a lot on here when people are just blatantly trashing them. I like Gamestop, but I dont like everything about Gamestop. They need to seriously work on some stuff. I'm fine to shake on it, dub this as a misunderstanding and have at least a shred of meaningful dialogue. Back to the original point. I think instore ordering makes sense in some cases, just not all of them. I wanted a copy of Katamari Forever for instance. Which is a 14.99 used title. So by the time you slap the 3.99 for shipping on top of it, that makes the game 26% more expensive. Factor sales tax and you are basically at 20 bucks. I ended up getting a used copy in flawless condition on Mercari for something like $12 free shipping. But lets say you could order someone a Switch and they just just wanted to go look elsewhere. Then yes, I'd be inclined to say that was a foolish decision on their end. Because if you find a Switch on Mercari it's going to run you $400 and you are gonna pay to ship that thing."

I'm allowed to shop where I please and feel like I'm best getting what I want. To be fair, I said correct me if I'm wrong, I was simply stating what I was told by a Gamestop employee. I'm also allowed to not want generic artwork. Generic artwork lowers the value of a game. If I'm paying all the money I want the whole thing. So blow it out your ass."
GameStop,fp8t63j,t3_gbmhi7,1588402150.0,"I honestly don't like doing this. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've been told I have to pay shipping to have it sent to that store for me to pickup. I'm not about that life. But even still, I also would only be ordering more obscure used games. One's in which I wouldn't buy not knowing if the original case and artwork were included. So I'm not going to have it shipped to the store when I cant see what im getting when I could just order it from a seller on Mercari and see exactly what I'm getting. Sorry Gamestop, but I don't want a used game in that dirty butt generic artwork."
PS4,fp8siyn,t1_fp8j0io,1588401550.0,"Not nescessarily. File sizes largely depend on compression. The catch to compression is that compression saves space, but uses system resources to decompress the files. So a really good algorithm could probably compress current gen games smaller than they are now, but then you have the matter of trying to optimize the game to perform well. Example, MGS5 is something like 25gb and The Witcher 3 (base game) is only a little over 50gb. But those games were developed by very talented programers. The other thing is that audio takes up a whole lot more space than I think people realize. So its fairly likely that the audio file sizes may not change much going forward. But we have yet to see what the PS5s Tempest audio engine is all about. So that being said, the hardware being significantly more powerful opens the door to compress further as needed and not sacrifice performance. The PS5s SSD isn't your run of the mill SSD based on what Cerny showed. It's not about just loading into a game faster. It's a matter of constantly streaming in game data faster to avoid system bottlenecks almost entirely. In essence it makes the RAMs job a whole lot easier. Doing that overcomes a HUGE issue developers face. The Outer Worlds had a much smaller world map than people expected due to this exact issue. Obsidian flatout said they could not work around the RAM limitations. If your RAM is having to be filled with repetetive assets like trees and cars and stuff, you lose the ability to have more custom assets. So the idea of this SSD is to allow developers a lot more freedom with the assets in game rather than just get you playing a little bit faster. It's really complicated this stuff."

tacobell,fl3scjt,t1_fl3q01f,1584796783.0,Oh no. Ohhhhh no. She wore a moo moo. She earned her moo moo.
GameStop,fl36xt8,t3_fm6v8u,1584771004.0,Well fuck me running. This is incredible. Lmao
PS5,fl34ogt,t1_fl2t9j6,1584768714.0,"Vibe. That's the word. PlayStation and Xbox are like Coke and Pepsi. I strongly prefer one, but some people think they taste the same."
PS5,fl2rmzl,t1_fl2qdp1,1584758155.0,Right. All the exclusives I want are for PS. Then I get the third party stuff. And why am I going to play a multiplatform game on Xbox because then I'm not adding to my trophy collection. I dont have anything against Microsoft or their console. I simply just have zero desire to own one. I want an Xbox about as bad as a Buckeyes fans want tickets to a Wolverines game.
tacobell,fl2ihqx,t1_fl274yu,1584751815.0,I'm actually guilty of this. I just like diet better. When Taco Bell launched Baja Blast Zero I shed tears of joy.
tacobell,fl2if4h,t1_fl2eseg,1584751766.0,Oh yeah. Our owners let us have a free combo on our break if we worked an 8 hour shift. Even after a couple of years working there I still wasnt sick of that food.
tacobell,fl1wdwm,t1_fl1vxdr,1584737692.0,"I used to manage a Charleys Grilled Subs years ago. There was a gal that was a regular that would order the same thing every time. A Large Bacon Three Cheese, a cheddar bacon ranch fry, and a large diet Pepsi. Then while she waited for us to prepare that, she'd go to Sbarro's and get a Stromboli. Then she'd proceed to eat every single bite. No joke. It was intense to watch."
PS5,fl1u5di,t1_fl188ka,1584736359.0,I haven't owned an Xbox in 12 years. Someone could give me one for free and I'd probably still never play it.
tacobell,fl1shgi,t3_flzjoz,1584735367.0,Does anyone else miss the old days of not being shamed by the masses for having a 1400 calorie meal?
Trophies,fl182r3,t1_fl0cc36,1584723822.0,"Desert Survivalist is kind of annoying to get, but it goes by easy when you get your system down. My least favorite trophy was winning 30 hands of Caravan. But all in all, the hardcore play through is pretty simple, and most of the damage challenges come pretty naturally. I had a good time with it, you just need to really plan your play through. I did it in two."
PS3,fl0tjom,t1_fl0ny02,1584715420.0,Desert Survivalist and winning 30 hands of Caravan was pretty awful. Lol
