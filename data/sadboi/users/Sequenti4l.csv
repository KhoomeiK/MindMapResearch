leagueoflegends,fpjmexq,t3_gdmys3,1588673949.0,"I know this must be really hard for riot to address but a lot of the problem imo is people watching popular streamers flame, be toxic and int on stream and think it‚Äôs acceptable / cool. I think young players that start off watching people like Yassuo need to see them respect the game and it‚Äôs community. 

The trend of flaming and talking down to players who are playing badly in games is having a bad impact on the community. I agree it‚Äôs funny to watch people like Yassuo lose their head in chat when their jungler makes a mistake, and I think that‚Äôs largely why he and others do it, but it gives the community a toxic role model to follow and there are never any consequences.

I don‚Äôt know what riot could do about this tbh, if they act of clips of streams sent in then they will be banning disproportionately more streamers which is unfair, but I think the community often feels disconnected from the devs compared to other games (a great example being runescape).

A little communication from Riot saying, hey we know you don‚Äôt mean harm, but think of the impression you leave on your millions of viewers who are gonna follow your actions in soloQ before you flame people in your games. If the community backs this video from Voyboy and we get a good movement going, with the help of Riot then I hope we can reach a point where the general community thinks it‚Äôs uncool to flame, int and be toxic, and people and will slowly stop this behaviour as it falls out of style.
