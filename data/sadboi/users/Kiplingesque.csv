With photoperiod plants though, you can screw up an amazing number of things in the vegetative stage and still pull off a great harvest.

HerbGrow,fpp3u3q,t3_geljgh,1588795484.0,"Need to ask a few questions first:

-Your plant looks small, and was never topped, but is clearly in flower.  Is it an auto?

-Your lower leaves look wet but the top doesn‚Äôt.  Are you foliar feeding or is that just water that splashed on the plant from a regular feeding?

-Environment (temp, humidity, airflow)?

-Nutrition?  Plants usually need supplemental nutrition once they show their first set of five-fingered leaves.  What are you feeding her and how often?  What is your grow medium?"
microgrowery,fpo6g2a,t1_fpnzfha,1588779199.0,Agreed.  Very slight ‚Äútaco-ing‚Äù.  Most likely mild heat or light stress.

They start small and slow.  Once you actually have some foliage / canopy and get everything dialed in you‚Äôll see the explosive growth you want.  Give them a tiny bit of airflow once you have a little more stem.  You don‚Äôt want it thrashing around but a tiny (very mild!!) bit of air agitation can help root development.

Also, I assume you‚Äôre ph‚Äôing your water?  I find my seedings prefer a ph of 5.9-6.1 as sprouts, then tend to prefer 6.1-6.3 as they get their first sets of 3 and 5-fingered leaves.

If you‚Äôre looking for high-calcium fertilizer, Greengro/Nature‚Äôs Pride, and even Roots Organic make some very decent calcium-rich top-dress formulas.

You could also dive into the rabbit hole of super soils and no-till (which it sounds like you already have, to some extent!).

If it‚Äôs not an auto the obvious answer is that you didn‚Äôt veg long enough.
