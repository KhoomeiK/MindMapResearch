I'm the same way with anxiety and panic attacks, if I become triggered and especially if it is a significant bout of anxiety, I will relapse. 

Last month I went to the doctor after all consuming suicidal thoughts would not go away and walked out of the appointment with anti depressant prescription and a referral to a psychiatrist. 

I also have a prescription now for Ativan, helps with the anxiety and potential panic attacks. 

I'm not saying these methods are the answer for everyone but they have helped me so far. 

Consider anti depressant medication and something for your anxiety if you haven't already. 

I also have started abstaining from all social media, it's helped as well, at least for me. 

Best of luck man. Relapses will happen, it just means you are trying. Keep on fighting and stay strong."
