When I started growing boobs, I was really excited. Boys were going to pay attention to me! Girls were going to envy me! I was going to be pretty! I wouldn't stop touching them (even at inappropriate times, I still struggle with that) like fidget toys. In middle school I realized I wasn't really attracted to men and that I craved their attention because I wanted to feel included in their social circles. I didn't feel welcome with the girls and wanted to have a physical reason to fit in. It was high school when I started questioning my gender, and my body. All my life I had enjoyed the attention that having a girl body gave me, but it was beginning to sour. Men who I wasn't interested in would stare at me while I wore the clothes that kept me cool in the summer. My body stopped seeming like it was my own. I loved other women's bodies but never saw myself in them, and not for the ""I'm not skinny"" reasons, something different. I'm having top surgery later this month and I'm so excited. It feels like I've been wearing training weights for my whole life and I'm about to be allowed to take them off and experience real life. No assumptions, no restrictions, free to not be held back by my assigned gender at birth. My boobs aren't a part of my body, they're just attached to it.

I would really recommend looking into some options for top surgery. A reduction won't really help, and if he decides to get top surgery when he's independent, that's another trauma to the chest with additional risks. Learn about what it entails so it's less scary, and understand that the medical system makes patients jump through a ton of hoops to make sure they're really committed to having surgery. It'll work out :)"
