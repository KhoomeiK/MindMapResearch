You can always talk about it or maybe ask if they pay the half of the amount. 

Hope this is a bit helpful"
Aupairs,f5fn5w8,t3_dnti0s,1572184511.0,"My host mum travels a lot too. What she did was flying over her sister in law to help me out so I don't have the kids all day long. I would still work the same amount of hours (even less because SIL wanted to spend time with the kids). I think this was a great solution. 

I had also a few times I had to babysit overnights. But the kids would just go to sleep. This was only once a week. I don't think it is normal to do multiple overnights. It also depends on what you agreed with them (contract). I think you should discuss this with them and make up a plan."
