I've been told by someone as well that i wasn't marriage material because i have some condition. 

I'm afraid of being judged but being alone is somewhat helping me heal those past hurts. I just realize i have to look for and appreciate the people who do accept me. By that, i usually look for weirdos or people with mental illnesses since they can't really judge if they're on the same boat.
