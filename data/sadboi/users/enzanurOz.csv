I know ones like that exist and yeah I don’t get it... But some old people literally cannot be alone and need medical supervision 24/7.

Isn’t assuming a woman can’t make her own decisions and it’s so unbelievable she would cover herself that a man must have forced her - an anti-feminist sentiment itself? I know FAR more woman who have had to fight their husbands and fathers to support them wearing hijab than women who have wanted to take it off but were forced to continue wearing it. I actually don’t personally know any situations of the latter but I know they of course exist. I personally get flak from the Muslim people in my family for wearing abaya, and don’t get me started on jilbab and khimar and such, and I can just forget about niqab. I want to wear these things."

converts,fnudl7h,t3_g3nshw,1587259738.0,"Welcome to Islam :) The fact they have known for a while that you’ve been having doubts about the Bible and have and read a Quran lead me to believe that either a) already know you’re Muslim b) won’t be shocked at all or c) even if they are shocked they won’t be angry - because if they has a problem with Islam wouldn’t they have spoke about it by now?Make du’a for Allah to open their hearts. You will be shocked at how Allah can open people’s hearts. Never forget how Uma ibn al Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) the second Caliph, wanted at first to kill Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) before accepting Islam and being one of his most dear companions. And in the worst case scenario, if your family creates a problem for you in regards to this - be patient and see it as an opportunity for reward - anything you sacrifice for the sake of Allah will be recompensed to you as more than what you sacrificed and Allah is with the patient. And best dawah (call to Islam) is how you behave, so always be positive so your family can see the beauty of Islam. I know this is all easier said than done by with the help and permission of Allah it is possible. I’m a revert as well and I know I’m the beginning it can be a lot at once, but it is a beautiful time. May Allah make you successful in this life and the next."
