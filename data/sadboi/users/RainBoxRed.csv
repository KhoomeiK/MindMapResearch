ankylosingspondylitis,fqw8jbc,t1_fqw0sah,1589695953.0,"My experience with opioids is that they are not even considered, I’m not sure if that is a result of the crisis or that this disease is chronic not acute and needs proper management. I was offered anti-inflammatories and paracetamol and then pred, none of which stop the disease progression as opioids do not either but are much safer to be on long term. I think if your symptoms warrant it you really want to end up on some DMARD as that will actually effect the disease itself and not just mask the pain."
ankylosingspondylitis,fqw696z,t3_gl69q8,1589694050.0,"If you need some relief in the mean time while you get all the investigations done, ask for prednisolone. It has been the one drug that had given me sufficient relief while NSAIDs have been fairly useless. 

I’m not in your criteria, I’m HLA-B27 +ve, but I have no existent inflammation markers, quite a bit of enthesitis not in my heel, and normal range of motion. So I miss out on a few of the key indicators. The rheumy diagnosed me mainly on the X-ray of the SIJ that showed grade 2 sacroilitis and +HLA-B27. 

Keep in mind ankylosing spondylitis is specifically the disease whereby your spine fuses, starting at your SIJs, but if you go broader to spondyloarthropathies then you may very well be considered under that umbrella. The terms and diagnosis criteria are just convenient ways for us to categorise things but there are many related terms like undifferentiated, seronegative, non axial etc that you might “fit” better into.

In the end it really comes down to how the rheumy wants to best manage your symptoms and what would be the best route to get the best outcome depending on your healthcare system.

But yes chronic illness, especially invisible ones, are an absolute filthy burden and please keep advocating and hopefully you’ll get some relief. The pharmaceutical gold standard for any sort of autoimmune inflammation disease appears to be bDMARDs so hopefully you can get onto those.

I just recently started Humira (2 weeks) and haven’t gotten amazing relief yet but I’ve heard it can take up to 3 months."

ankylosingspondylitis,fq8gvzg,t1_fq8csqh,1589165914.0,"I’ve heard this approach before and it sounds reasonable and I’ve even found some research that supports it but the problem I find is that some people say this is a miracle cure: just eliminate starch and forget about TNF blockers and your AS is cured. But the reality is that it might be one helpful approach for some people as an addition to medication and exercise. Similar to how there are many types of biologics even though in theory just one type would work for everyone it doesn’t work like it in reality. I’ve tried a low starch diet and it did nothing for me but steroids have been a godsend.

I theorise that perhaps the low starch/reduce inflammation approach doesn’t work for me because I’ve got low ESR and CRP normally. But then why do potent anti-inflammatories (steroids) work so well?

ankylosingspondylitis,fpmugfs,t3_gedaus,1588742042.0,"Pretty much my experience too. You will have pain before you have visible degeneration on the X-ray. Also be aware that X-ray reporting is subjective and if the reporting doctor isn’t looking specifically for sacroillitis they might not find it if it’s grade 1. Mine also started unilaterally and then switched sides.

I had plenty of ultrasounds, CTs, X-rays while I had pain and they were negative or inconclusive. I also had and have non-elevated inflammation markers (ESR and CRP). Eventually my physio wrote my GP a letter pretty much saying I suspect strongly rainboxred has AS, send them to a rheumy. So you need to see a rheumy.

The scans should be of the SIJs as that is where AS starts and how it is diagnosed. If you have the same type of inflammation degeneration but it’s not in your pelvis is called undifferentiated or nonaxial spondyloarthropathy or something like that (I’m not a doctor).

In my country a GP cannot order an MRI, a specialist has to do that so that step was never necessary for me to see the rheumy. But if you have the option of an MRI, get it. There no risk like an X-ray or CT so no harm and it will be a good reference later if you get diagnosed and want to track the disease progression. In any case it’s not the GPs area to make any calls based on the imaging, you need to see the rheumatologist.

And you already know this but pain in the morning and improving with activity is huge check mark towards AS diagnosis."

I don’t know if it’s just placebo but I think that I’m starting to see the moon face side effect and when I started it was a struggle mentally. Again I’m not sure if that was the pred but it’s a known side effect. As far as the osteoporosis I’m not worried as I’m on a really low dose and hope to get off it soon and it’s not really something you’ll know about until you get a scan or break something.

I started Humira recently so when that starts to take effect I’ll get off the pred entirely. But I know it’s effective if I need it for a bad flare in the future.

Do you get relief from that dose? I’m just talking from my personal experience and not from any medical knowledge but I think there are higher doses used, I’ve heard of 50-60mg, but the side effects are bad enough it’s not considered a good idea long term at high(er) doses which I think 25mg is considered a high dose.

It also helps to have a medical team that supports you with easy access to drugs like steroids which is a god send when you are in the midst of a flair. Don’t forget paracetamol if you need extra analgesic.

In the early days, when I was getting shade from the sonographers because I couldn’t tell them exactly where the pain was and every scan came back normal, I mainly used OTC ibuprofen and codeine. Even over the counter doses was enough to realise that opioids are not to be messed with. They are hands down the best analgesic but they will destroy you if you let it get hold. Opioids are hard to come by these days and it’s for good reason. 

You don’t really want to rely on analgesics anyways as the pain comes from inflammation and you want to treat that. NSAIDS, steroids, DMARDs, some people have good results with ‘low inflammation’ diets. Also the non pharmacological treatments are very important too: activity, movement, stretching.

As far as the psychology you have to deal with that separately. I have, over the last 10 years, been through what I call a grieving process learning to accept the limitations of my body. You will get either very limited or no mental health support from the rheumatologist and one of the things you learn from this disease is you have to be good at taking charge of all aspects of your health. You can’t rely on anyone else to have your back as each medical person really only looks after one aspect and the patient has to tie it all together.

I’ve struggled with self doubt a lot through this and that and the fatigue are some of the hardest issues I’ve had to deal with. Anyway that’s enough blabber for now."
