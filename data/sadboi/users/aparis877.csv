I liked working for a temp company for a while because things were always changing.

Usually I start to feel trapped at work, not just like eh this sucks wish I could be home. But like in a prison trapped, I would dread every day I had to go to work.

Started working at a school as a lunch lady. Not a glamorous job, but I really like all the time off. I work short shifts too which really helps with the trapped feeling. Ive learned I can't really force myself to do the 9-5 grind, not if I want stability. I have to minimize the impact the job has on my life so that I dont feel suffocated. Not to say it's all Rose's, but it's also not as bad as a lot of jobs I've had.  I'm sure the medication is helping with that too though lol."
