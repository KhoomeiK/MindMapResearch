ADHD,fo8lujv,t3_g66cck,1587599098.0,"Congrats.  I culdnt do well in school unfortunately.  I rlly love learning which is the irony, but i was too scatterbrained and messed up in college to do well.  Grade school i was totally zoned out and depressed and anxious and wuld just go home and watch tv and sleep from the exhaustion and so i lost the opportunity to learn a lot when it would have mattered more.   Now im the guy who teaches himself math, physics, chemistry, biology, computers and programming and so on on in my free time because it is all the stuff i wished i had learned.  Sucks i wont have any evidence (degree) to show for it.  Hopefully the knowledge comes in use for me eventually or else im fucked.  Most people don’t understand i legit didn’t have the energy or concentration to do anything productive even though i wanted to do well and have always been a curious person.  Nowadays i have random ppl tell me i shuld go to college and it frustrates me so bad i wanna just go insane.  Top it off with the fact that the few things i have been hyperfocused and dedicated on in my life have completely failed and i alrdy feel like an old man ready to die."
ADHD,fnl189d,t3_g26ue3,1587044888.0,"I think u did rlly good on getting ur point across in this post!  Adhd def makes my mind go 1000mph, constantly jumping ideas, but maybe u are experiencing a little anxiety if you are stuttering?  Reason i say that is becuz you don’t seem to have trouble communicating thru ur post, and I also had/have the stuttering problem because i developed an anxiety disorder becuz i think adhd makes us vulnerable to stuff like that somehow.  Adderall 100% helps me as far as the focus goes but it is still wild up in my head, just helps me to focus on the things i think of even tho i still jump around a lot.  I also have ocd and sometimes question wut my adhd even is because i have a ton of the symptoms and also don’t feel like a stereotypical person diagnosed with adhd, but i know adderall helps me alot so i aint giving it up lol."
ADHD,fn9v96w,t1_fn9otbt,1586785370.0,"Thanks :). I also have bad response to bipolar meds, so strange.  I have tried so many meds at this point that keeping track is hard.  I kinda just wanna go off the current ssri im on and start fresh, no meds.  It’s a rlly hard decision to make but i figure i wuldn’t have been taking it 100 years ago and maybe natural is just better at this point for me idk.  I just remember the symptoms i had and they were bad but nothing seemed to get better on the meds either except i culd fall asleep.  Adderall definitely gives me energy tho but i don’t like it either since i’m so scatterbrained on it, even tho i am off it as well.  I can actually focus when im on it tho which i culd never do so idk.  Little bit of background anxiety from it as well.  I’m just so frustrated and wanting to have answers already, and idk if i ever will at this point so fuck it.  Anyways tho, ill def need to titrate off my ssri super slow cuz the discontinuation syndrome is awful..."

ADHD,fl5pnas,t1_fl5owrr,1584842522.0,"You could be right.  I think most psychiatrist drop the ball with heir patients unfortunately (at least in my experience).  If you don’t think you have adhd i would definitely bring up the reasons with your psychiatrist and do your own research and see if what they are saying makes sense.  I wouldn’t get too worried with the diagnosis of adhd if you are noticing that the medicine is helping you, but there could definitely be a better treatment option out there for you.  I’m also searching for better treatment for myself since i don’t think that settling for an adderall script for myself is going to help me as much as other possibilities, despite knowing that the adderall definitely helps me and that i do seem to exhibit a lot of adhd symptoms.  Hopefully your psychiatrist that you go to is good and open to listening to you, since they should know more about all this stuff than you, but like i said, they can drop the ball just like any other person in any other profession.  Sometimes they don’t know as much about a particular disorder than the other psych and if they aren’t aware of how little they know then they can actually cause you alot of trouble if it means you aren’t getting treated properly.  It sucks to think that the professionals aren’t always doing their jobs to the best of their ability and that you have to suffer for their negligence, but that is why i believe that being as informed as you can be on your diagnosis, and communicating concerns with your doctor to be so important.  Also, if you don’t feel right with your doctor try to find someone else since that might be the best option."
ADHD,fl5l1rd,t1_fl5ku53,1584839286.0,"That definitely could be the reason.  Stimulant medications are known for causing this type of stuff.  Bfrb isn’t supposed to be considered OCD, but i also had really noticeable OCD when i wasn’t on lexapro and i think they are linked.  I’m not really too sure why bfrb isn’t considered part of it, i’m going to look it up and see what the internet says now lol. 

- i dont think it is adhd either, but maybe there is a link between adhd and bfrb.   I wouldn’t know tho"
ADHD,fl5khqo,t1_fl5ka18,1584838895.0,"Trust me, i am.  I’m in a crappy situation atm because i was extremely depressed for a long time and had no energy to do anything.  I recently quit seeing a psychiatrist i had been going to for years because he seemed to have no interest in helping me and wuld just put me on lots of different medicines and when none of them seemed to help he wuldn’t have any answers.  I feel like finding a good psychiatrist is actually really hard >.<"
ADHD,fl5glvk,t3_fmgcsj,1584836239.0,"Has this started since medication?  I have always had bfrb (body focused repetitive behavior) and notice that it is a little worse on adderall, but not something i am extremely worried about.  I take lexapro 20mg and it helped me to stop pulling at my hair and picking my skin like i did when unmedicated, but it is still there, especially when i am stressed (which is common since my life sucks).  I think you need to identify whether this is medicine induced or not, and then from there you can make more informed decisions."
ADHD,fkmjuvo,t1_fkmiows,1584330864.0,"So interesting and disturbing considering all the psychiatrists i went to never seemed to view it that way.  When i first mentioned that i wanted an addy script my psychiatrist at the time thought it was 100% the wrong move and wasn’t happy when i kept insisting but decided to concede and give me 30 days at 10mg.  He wuldnt prescribe me it again tho and i ended up going on a lot of different medicines that didn’t help, or made me feel even worse.  I went a long time afterwards without adderall until recently that i went to another guy and got prescribed 25mg xr.  At the higher dose i really realized it was helping me and started thinking about it all a lot more.  The crazy part is that i was seriously failing in life and now im in a bit of a predicament and have lost a lot of opportunities i had when i was younger.  Not only that, but i was so miserable and hopeless due to the fact that i was desperately seeking help for such a long time and that i kept getting let down that i ended up making some horrible decisions that culd have ended my life but i got lucky.  When i think about that, and how others aren’t as lucky it is so fucking sad and depressing.  To think that so many people culd legit be dead or living way less than their potential from not getting proper treatment makes me really angry.  This system sucks if this is the best we can do  and the doctors that act like everything is fine are dumbasses imo.  I truly believe there are a lot of people that are being completely left behind even when they seek help from the people supposedly trained to spot these types of problems.  To me it all borders on criminal negliglence and something needs to change because this isn’t something to be proud of."

Guitar,fivcojl,t1_fiv8e2l,1582757977.0,"He is frustrated with the learning process but that is because he is stuck, how can he even know whether he likes guitar when he is still a beginner?  He clearly wants to learn guitar if he has been interested in it for a couple of years now and that is what is important.  Your attitude is like saying why should i study something i’m interested in if i’d rather play video games.  Sometimes it is alright to stop doing something, like if you actually know you don’t enjoy it anymore or find something else that you click more easily with that replaces the previous hobby, but don’t just give up the second things get hard."
Guitar,fiuzelh,t1_fitd6pd,1582751018.0,Totally disagree.  He wants to learn and is having trouble atm so ur advice is to just quit?  Cmon now.  Is that ur advice for everything?  If he already knew what he was doing and was just flat out uninterested that would be a different story but what you’re saying is terrible advice imo not just for guitar but life in general.
Guitar,fiuy85v,t3_f9rlqa,1582750414.0,"U aren’t specific about what it is that you are struggling with but i echo other replies in saying maybe you should get some lessons.  Anyone can play guitar, you just need to understand what you’re doing and have some muscle memory.  If you aren’t doing things correctly or have gaps in knowledge it can make learning really difficult.

P.s.  Don’t quit.  I don’t understand why people are telling you to do that.  You clearly want to learn, you just need to get through the struggle you’re in atm.  I quit guitar when i was young and wish i hadn’t.  Once you get confident in your picking and strumming and music theory and all that other stuff you might be kinda meh towards guitar and decide to learn other stuff, and that’s fine, but to just give up because you can’t seem to get something is a shitty feeling to say the least."

AskReddit,ffa1qvm,t3_esc8vq,1579726138.0,"We would go fishing and some of the things i would try to say would be

get a job at publix asap and save up your money but also dont be afraid to get things you really want and to do fun things with the cash you make.  Just dont spend left and right

go to a psychiatrist for adderalll because you have undiagnosed adhd

Dont weightlift or box, work on being healthy instead and use good posture and stretch

don’t quit guitar, learn music theory (i would probably just teach to younger self right then and there tbh), start making your own music, take an art class elective, do well in school because it is the way to a good life and everything they are “teaching” you is fundamental knowledge that you will need and want to know.  Make sure to study and dont be afraid of being a perfectionist, you will feel good about yourself when you tackle a problem and not let it go until you are satified with your results and it will build your self esteem and accomplishments and help you to learn in the process.

Dont avoid your responsibilities, but dont overwork yourself

Remember that accomplishing even one little thing a day adds up quick. 

Do your homework and understand what you are learning and always be curious and search for answers and go to college and take the classes that interest you but also have a plan and definitely major in something stem related

control your temper, you aren’t able to change other people, that is on them, not you.  Never allow them to treat you badly however, you have rights and are allowed to set up boundaries.  Do what is necessary to have yourself treated the way you deserve without being a bad person and at least mention things to authority figures if it is out of your control.   

Dont do crazy things, you dont need to prove anything.  Associate with good people, keep communications with shit people to bare minimum, you dont need to feel bad about caring about yourself

There are good people out there and what you are going through is unfair and hard, but you are a strong person and you can make it and yes you are a little different from the “normal” but it is a gift in disguise and life can someday be great even though it feels awful atm and there are lots of other people struggling too

Ask out that girl you like and treat her good

Dad is crazy, mom is enabling, brother is deeply wounded, dont trigger dad but also dont allow him to bully you and dont get mad at mom for marrying him and be kind to brother and you will be fine.  

The people in power are failing you atm, you are not responsible for their failure.  Dont be so hard on yourself

There might be more stuff i would say but that’s all i can think of rn.  I would probably be elaborating alot on topics i mentioned.  Also i would give younger me a hug because he needed it"
