I really don’t have an answer that WILL help. I know what I do when I’m feeling like that. It’s usually weed and sleep. But I do know a lot of people suggest journaling so you can find patterns in your moods and activities and hopefully avoid triggers that make it worse. Even a few words a day helps. I use a mood tracker app that just asks how I’m feeling once or twice a day; How I slept, what activities I did, what I ate. 

I hope something here helps. I’m really just throwing spaghetti at a wall and hoping it sticks. Let me know if you want/need to talk about anything, I’m always at home, always on my computer, and always on my phone.
