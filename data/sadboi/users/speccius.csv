OCPoetry,fkfsebp,t3_fi8mrj,1584141417.0,"Hello. Just read your poem. 

I‚Äôve struggled with depression for about three years and this poem really struck a chord with me. It‚Äôs very visceral and brutal. It‚Äôs in your face but in a subtle way. It‚Äôs interesting to me because the rhyming scheme you‚Äôve used, to some, might be considered quite basic but I think it works very well to suggest the repetitive nature when you feel like this. Each day feels the same and whether you wrote it this way on purpose or not, the rhyming actually creates a pretty unique flow to your stanzas that really feels like you‚Äôre stuck; a low mood or a depressed feeling. 

I also like the description in your middle verses gets more eloquent and the sentences slightly longer. To me it feels like the whole rhythm of the poem is on a bell curve. It starts slow, like any day would, and builds and builds, then you reach the end of the poem, the lines shorten and you‚Äôre almost back at the beginning rhythmically. 

I think you‚Äôve done a great job with this poem. I love the description you‚Äôve used and the feel of the poem perfectly suits the theme/emotions that you‚Äôre trying to portray.

A pleasure to read. Thanks bud."
OCPoetry,fkfrykd,t3_fi2gz5,1584141124.0,"The imagery in this superb. It‚Äôs so visual. I love these kinds of poems that evoke images in the reader‚Äôs mind. Each reader might see it a slightly different way and these kind of vivid, descriptive poems are great at leaving room for interpretation by the reader and that helps people connect more deeply with the poem. 

The other thing I think works well is the structure. The way you‚Äôve broken up the stanzas, whilst short, it really helps to emphasise the descriptive language in each couplet. I had to read it twice to try and find the structure and flow and what‚Äôs really clever is that the way you‚Äôve broken it up, and separated each use of imagery makes it flow like a photo album. You‚Äôre seeing snapshots of a life almost. I find it difficult to write strong visual poems and almost focus too much on the description and end up, sort of, over defining things. 

This poem has a great balance and the visual imagery used almost creates the flow of the poem itself. I really like it."

SuicideWatch,fh25tn9,t3_f15uk2,1581236572.0,"Asking for help when you‚Äôre suicidal is kind of a double edge sword. You let people know that you‚Äôre struggling but at the same time you might just be all over the place in regards to your thinking.

Reading your post, what you‚Äôve described sounds very similar to the anxiety that I have. You‚Äôre letting all of these events and situations pileup on top of you. Just because you might have a lot on the go with all these different things, all these different plates spinning at once, it doesn‚Äôt mean anything bad about you. The only person you need to worry about in regards to yourself is you.

Being comfortable with yourself is one of the hardest but most rewarding things you can do. The main crux of it, and what I found to be particularly helpful, is trying to take judgement out of things. You may feel a certain way or are certain things that have happened but you didn‚Äôt control that and you can‚Äôt control it. The only thing you can control is your thoughts and feelings.

It sounds to me from what you‚Äôve said, that you‚Äôve got a lot to live for and a lot of people that care about you so I wouldn‚Äôt worry about being suicidal because that can bring on a whole different kind of anxiety. Just worry about being happy with you and being okay. it‚Äôs okay to not be okayBut equally it‚Äôs okay to just be okay."
SuicideWatch,fd986aq,t3_ejysqk,1578229765.0,"Even if you stopped existing or killed yourself, good luck being forgotten. It‚Äôs never going to work out how you want and it‚Äôs ok to feel like that sometimes but it‚Äôs just depression telling you things that aren‚Äôt true. Remember it‚Äôs an illness you‚Äôre fighting against; you can sense that in the way you‚Äôve commented to people. There‚Äôs a desire to live but you‚Äôre not sure how. Try and be present in the day and don‚Äôt worry about the future or the past or ‚Äúopportunities you‚Äôve ruined‚Äù. You can‚Äôt change that however much you‚Äôd like. 

My therapist always used to say ‚Äúif you‚Äôve got one foot in the past, and one foot in the future, you‚Äôre just pissing all over your day‚Äù. It‚Äôs true. Worrying about the future or ruminating on the past can end up taking all your attention away from what‚Äôs happening to you right now today, and potentially something that might give you that spark to keep going for another while. 

Just get through today, then start again tomorrow. Don‚Äôt look further ahead. That‚Äôs it. Get through today."
SuicideWatch,fbdwej1,t3_ecte93,1576772841.0,"Depends what your definition of loneliness is. Dissociation is a big part of depression and certainly one of the first things that I struggle with in my really down patches. You have to remember that depression, anxiety, PTSD; whatever it is that might be the cause of your symptoms - is an illness; an illness that skews your perspective of yourself and the world. 

On my good days, it can be a struggle too. Finally having the motivation to get up and get out, messaging friends to see if anyone is around to socialise with and sometimes no one is available and it can be easy to slip back into that feeling of loneliness. I tend to find loneliness stems from sort of feeling of negative self worth and feeling like not only are you alone, but no one wants to be with you. One of the ways to tackle loneliness, and fuck me, is it difficult; is to try and be more comfortable with yourself. To be more comfortable being alone. Being alone and being lonely are two different things and being content with being alone, by yourself, with your thoughts can be hugely beneficial. It‚Äôs all to do with relationship to self and usually there‚Äôs some underlying negative belief about ourselves we‚Äôre trying to validate. It‚Äôs ok to not be ok. Be comfortable with yourself first and the way you‚Äôre feeling. Make that ok. If we were all able to do that, it wouldn‚Äôt matter how many people we had in our support networks; we‚Äôd be happy just being with ourselves."
SuicideWatch,fb637qm,t3_eblned,1576540262.0,"Don‚Äôt you think if you‚Äôve posted on this sub it maybe means in some sense, a small part of you, doesn‚Äôt want to die? Hold onto that. Something has driven you to post on this sub tonight. Some more cynical types might argue it‚Äôs for attention or a ‚Äúcry for help‚Äù but it really doesn‚Äôt matter. 

To me, having been in the same situation you are now, you have to find hope in whatever you can; something that just keeps you going for one more day. Don‚Äôt think about forever and dealing with this forever. Just deal with it today. Then deal with tomorrow. Then the next day. 

The fact you‚Äôve posted how you feel signals to me that some part of you is looking for comfort in others and some part of you is looking for someone to provide a reason not to take your own life. If you‚Äôre looking for reasons not to do it, don‚Äôt do it. 

The reasons will show up eventually. One day at a time."

depression,f8fq6y6,t3_e0p347,1574547938.0,"Try not to let things that have happened in the past, however recent, force you to make assumptions about the future. If you‚Äôve one foot in the past, and one foot in the future then you‚Äôre just pissing all over your day. 

It‚Äôs all about perception. Those things getting you down may be the case right now but let time take its course, be kind to yourself and live in the moment. It won‚Äôt always be like this."
depression,f8fo9ys,t3_e0oro3,1574547191.0,"I feel like that sometimes and loneliness can be really tough, especially at this time of year. After going through intensive therapy myself, you learn that making assumptions about things and acting as if those assumptions are the truth can be really damaging. 

You don‚Äôt know that you won‚Äôt find someone who loves you in the way you describe. How could you? It‚Äôs the same way you can‚Äôt know when or how you‚Äôre going to die. Typically for most people that isn‚Äôt a fear that‚Äôs rattling around in their brain most of the time. 

Whether you meet someone or not, it doesn‚Äôt really matter. You can‚Äôt know if or when you‚Äôll meet someone who loves you like that. It‚Äôs out of your control. All you have control of right now is your thoughts and feelings; how you are perceiving that situation in your head. It always comes down to blame. Maybe you feel being alone is a bad thing or a sign of something negative about you. However, what evidence suggests that? Is there something wrong with being alone? No, of course not. We‚Äôve just become a society or species that deems a partner as paramount to happiness but I know many people who are happy individuals leading their own life. 

This whole idea about finding love is actually, I find, more to do with relationship with one‚Äôs self than relationship with others. 

Something to mull over perhaps?"
depression,f8fnkcd,t3_e0ou17,1574546764.0,"You haven‚Äôt lived your whole life yet so if those ‚Äúbest days‚Äù of yours were wasted, then it means they weren‚Äôt your best days and those days are yet to come. If you look back on them and feel negative then that means they were bad days and that better days are coming. 

The thing about being down or low is you‚Äôve got so much headroom and room to get higher. If you want better days then make that happen by being true to yourself. Self care is vital. Do things that you love to do and by doing so, you‚Äôll bring about a change in your mindset. You‚Äôll realise one of two things or maybe both. 1; that by being true to yourself and doing what you love, opportunities and encounters come around that you never saw coming and can turn some days into the best you‚Äôve ever had, and 2; those days that seem wasted looking back, maybe weren‚Äôt a waste after all - they may end up being the catalyst through which you start doing things that you love and actively making these days to come your best days. 

It‚Äôs all a matter of perspective. No one gets everything right and worrying too much about your ‚Äúbest days‚Äù just puts pressure on yourself and stops you living in the moment. Some of my best days have just been me, by myself, doing something I enjoy and having some time to myself.
