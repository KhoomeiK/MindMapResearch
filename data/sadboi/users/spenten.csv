On the positive, the movie was really funny! So it was a good day."

Awesome that you got one! Enjoy it!"

AskReddit,f7aou0n,t3_dv0prc,1573535071.0,"Saying ""I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.""  
Hearing this throughout my childhood just lead me to believe the I was a failure in the eyes of my parents. I would have much rather my parents just tell me they were pissed instead of trying to dodge and cover up their anger as something 'Less impactful'. I know it has also really fucked up others around me. Having spoken with my siblings at points they were also deeply affected by this in their development.  


Please just tell your kids you are pissed. It's better in the long run."

That, a dank ass bowl of Ramen, and a hug."
AskReddit,f1y2vzu,t3_day18o,1569808373.0,"She told me she loved her boyfriend and was focused on being with him. I said I just needed to get my feelings that developed for years off of my chest and didn't want to lose her as a friend. We were best friends before, are still best friends to this day. The boyfriend is out of the picture after years of him cheating and breaking her heart and overall being a stinky douche parade. She's doing her best and just moved to a new state on her own. I'm really proud of her!"
AskReddit,f1y251b,t3_datsdq,1569807966.0,"Had a crush on this girl for years, one day she came up to me to ask an embarrassing question. You know, the type of situation where you think ""OH SHIT IT'S HAPPENING!"" only for her to be like ""Is your friend single and do you think they like me?"" Two days later they are dating and having a grand time. My ass just sitting there like ""Fuck, played myself like a damn fiddle."

AskReddit,f1y0ayd,t3_cyw1da,1569807009.0,"I was at my community college for a test early in the morning on a monday. After working on 3-D modeleing a shitty sword and animating a cactus getting shot I decided to go sit in the bathroom. Ya know, doing what you do in there. However, as I was sitting there minding my own business I hear in the stall next to me panting, grunting, and loud vocaloid music. Now this music wasn't loud for being outside of a bathroom but while sitting in this echo chamber it was as loud as Spinal Tap. So, sitting there, mortified, scared to run into this person while washing my hands I did the only thing a sane person should do in this situation. I sat there, silent, like I was trying to escape a T-Rex that couldn't see me if I just sat still and didn't breathe. I was in there for ten more minutes... This man was jerkin' it to Hatsune Miku and the gang while I just wanted to take a shit and check my phone."

Depression and anxiety suck dood, but working through and with it is one of my proudest accomplishments on a daily basis. I know you've got this in the bag! Hope you have a great school year!
