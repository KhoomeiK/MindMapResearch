GradSchool,fr1xp7t,t1_fr1wvq7,1589827693.0,Also what dept are you in? Im in Chemistry. If you post in the r/aggies subreddit you might be able to get in touch with a grad student in your dept! Or someone who can put you in contact with one.
GradSchool,fr1wvq7,t3_gm0r0k,1589827293.0,As someone at texas a&m i can confirm that research labs open up starting june 1st. If fact at a&m there are discussions about classes being in person come fall.
Nicegirls,fqw9ce3,t3_gl2iz5,1589696654.0,When I reject their calls 12 times in a row and get mad when they call the 13th time because GODDDAMMIT STOP CALLING ME
GradSchool,fqvvnir,t1_fqvv21b,1589686223.0,"Thank you for taking the time to write that essay. Dude you nailed how I'm feeling exactly. I 100% feel like a dancing monkey trying to convince people im not a complete idiot. Glad to hear about the person who couldn't answer questions because that is my BIGGEST FEAR . that ill be asked something and im just like uhhh......uhhhh....potato. Or say something insanely dumb. 

THANK YOU"
GradSchool,fqvszgy,t3_gjpgsb,1589684489.0,Totally cool id say. My cohort didnt do it before but during our 2 week orientation there was a group chat for sure.
GradSchool,fqvsvq5,t3_gjrfvm,1589684421.0,Ive been in my program for 5 years and lived with fellow grad students in my program for 4. Granted we work in different groups so it's not really a ton of overlap. It is nice to have someone who gets it and knows exactly who or what you mean.
GradSchool,fqvsi3v,t1_fqq7k10,1589684182.0,I 100% feel this. Also had an existential crisis in Y3. You got this! Also its a real good time to think about what you actually want. (I still dont have answers but i know what i dont want)
GradSchool,fqvsbhd,t3_gjtf43,1589684063.0,Well mostly because I'm almost done. Also because some people basically told me I couldnt do it so I NEED to do it out of sheer need to prove them wrong.
GradSchool,fqvrjmk,t3_gjj429,1589683576.0,"The heck. In our dept we get maybe 5 min on a 40min talk if you run over but otherwise they just stop you. Like, no. Read the damn requirements. Same with reports/papers"

GradSchool,fqvqvbs,t3_gl5dh2,1589683144.0,Id say PC mostly for software compatibility. There is still a lot of stuff out there that doesn't have a mac version.
GradSchool,fqvqput,t3_gl3yi3,1589683044.0,I have many side interests that I could see as a career but cooking/baking is my number 1. Which really isnt too far off from my field of study (chemistry) ðŸ˜‚

firefly,fqv42sd,t1_fqux9cw,1589669463.0,Lol it is chinese. Just really terrible chinese. Sometimes i have to watch the scene like 10 times to realise which swear they were going for...
firefly,fqv3yk2,t3_gkxsr0,1589669396.0,Half the time the chinese is mangled anyway so it probably still flies under the radar ðŸ˜‚

criminalminds,fqs1zlf,t1_fpxdjbq,1589596739.0,Yeah idk what would have happened if they didnt bring emily back after that. I might have given up
criminalminds,fqs1vrc,t3_gg392m,1589596676.0,By far Hotch. Emily's exit made sense. Also JJ's forced leaving. But they fixed that lol. I didn't really enjoy Gideon i always felt he thought he was better than the team. And i didn't LOVE elle. Maybe blake. Her exit was sad
criminalminds,fqs1d2t,t3_gg3nx5,1589596370.0,I like the one with reid and prentiss in the cult. But it would depend o. What the individual likes
criminalminds,fqs16d3,t1_fqrxx30,1589596260.0,What did you put on it
criminalminds,fqrr624,t3_gg88c5,1589590155.0,"I love how they cut to Reid's ""you fucked up and got rekt"" smirk in the scene too"
criminalminds,fqrr01q,t1_fqrqvt1,1589590052.0,Or hotch and Rossi. Team mom and team dad for the win.
criminalminds,fqrqvt1,t3_ggh2tx,1589589980.0,I gotta go with Hotch and Reid. Maybe not quite as overt. Or Rossi and Garcia.
criminalminds,fqrqr91,t1_fqrqfg4,1589589904.0,I get that. But Joy already has a professional career as a jorunalist and Angel might be attached to Morgan but I dont think it necessarily translates. To be honest I could more likely see Ellie doing the law enforcement thing than Angel if we wanna talk about people Morgan has touched through his job. Especially since her dad was also a cop and he died saving her.
criminalminds,fqrqh3v,t3_ggq3m7,1589589736.0,"The most aww my heart moment for me was Jack passing over his spiderman costume to be miniHotch. ""Spidermans not a real superhero"" and ""Im you daddy""

criminalminds,fqrpiaz,t1_fqc4erz,1589589153.0,He wanted to feel like he was making a difference in the world. Research is cool and all but you almost never see the impact on people's lives. It takes forever to get to that point.
criminalminds,fqrpclc,t1_fqkuzfm,1589589060.0,I dont know if its realistic to expect the BAU kids to follow in their parents footsteps. I could see Jack doing it because of how much he idolizes Hotch and views him as a superhero. But it is unlikely that all the kids end up in the same place. Would be interesting to see how he reacts to constantly being compared to his dad too.
criminalminds,fqrp4xp,t3_gia77d,1589588933.0,Id love to see Hotch's back story. As well as how Rossi came to leave the BAU. Also the panic Garcia probably incited when she hacked the DOJ
criminalminds,fqrouvw,t3_giq3ae,1589588764.0,REID HOTCH AND JJ. ALSO GARCIA
criminalminds,fqronum,t1_fqocxpc,1589588647.0,"Yeah i mean MGG and paget were friends even before the show. But i think its normal some case members get along better with each other. And depending on how active they are on insta, not following someone might not mean much."

criminalminds,fqro8fz,t3_gjfi8i,1589588392.0,The writers sometimes make mistakes. Like how Reid ended up with an extra PhD because in the prank war they accidentally said he went to MIT. (He supposedly went to Caltech)
criminalminds,fqro04v,t3_gjfmpy,1589588253.0,I always saw it as a familial type live. Especially when we see his relationship with Jessica later on. He cares for JJ in a very similar manner to how he cares for Jessica. And JJ is just a big mother hen who just herds the stray cats that are the BAU.
criminalminds,fqrno4b,t3_gk3jel,1589588053.0,Hotch always struck me as the kind of guy who would not be happy in a purely administrative role. I'd think he'd work till retirement age then maybe go back to being a prosecutor so he can keep catching the bad guys.

criminalminds,fqomar4,t3_gjvs80,1589518651.0,It comes back a couple times. At seemingly convenient times. Which is a little annoying but also not entirely out of the realm of possibility in real life. Sometimes the stressful situations make you lose a handle on things.

AmItheAsshole,fqj5bk8,t3_gj1nik,1589405250.0,"At first i was like are you showing favoritism. But those aren't even your kids. As someone who comes from a similar family situation, i can say for sure if my bros dad gave him cool stuff i wouldnt be upset. Just maybe want him to share. But if my step mom gave him something fancy for no reason and I never got something I would definitely be upset. NTA. ensuring the kids arent resentful is your exes responsibility, not yours."
TwoSentenceHorror,fqgpct4,t3_gifpji,1589352819.0,Horrifying. But people can probably tell which twin is still alive...

I say that, but I experienced a stretch of time where I hated myself so much I actively avoided mirrors.

Even now I find it difficult to accept compliments. When my SO says something nice about how I look my standard response is ""I'm glad you think so"". Or just making jokes or a side comment to take away from it. 

It's difficult sometimes growing up with that expectation. But like a lot of things life throws at you, you learn to deal with it in your own way."
