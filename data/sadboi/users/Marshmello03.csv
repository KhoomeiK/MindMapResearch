You’d think the dumb motherfucker would take it off AT LEAST as soon as he heard the death rattle, but nope. This is probably the sickest most evil thing ive seen on fiftyfifty so far. This isn’t just a sadist, this is a murderer trying to conceal his ‘murderer’ tendencies. Even a sadist would’ve let her out when she started flailing like that. Also when he did let her out, it was very obvious she was in serious trouble, and he did NOTHING, except put the sheet back over her fucking face."

Or if thinking about it leads you to ruminate/overthink more, than you could look at something physical that he gave you or that reminds you of him (i.e a letter), to remind yourself how much he loves/cares about you. This works for me very well, and I hope it helps you. <3 (Also it might help to remind yourself love isn't always verbal, its often shown through actions. : )"
