Yes teach your child to eat for their health, but leave weight out of the conversation, no matter how heavy they are. Children should not have to suffer for something that is their parents fault. If you provide them only the balanced diet they need to grow and maintain a healthy weight, they will have no choice but to eat it. That's it.

EDanonymemes,fqijbxz,t1_fqi7d9n,1589396764.0,"It's so nice to see someone explain this, and you put it really well. I've had restrictive eating issues for around 6 years and am not underweight for that reason. I've done it over and over again where I basically starve for 2 weeks to a month and then break down big time, b/p for a week, and then binge for like a month and gain everything back. It's like the ED version of crash dieting. The urge to starve consumes me to the point where, if I kept on like that, I'd probably die before getting to my goal weight. Then, scared and crazy from starving, I completely lose control and binge nonstop. I probably wouldn't call that eating pattern anorexia, though. If the person isn't underweight, it would probably clasifies as EDNOS and/or bullimia. Or atypical anorexia, which is an EDNOS subtype. I've never been diagnosed, but I probably currently have EDNOS or EDNOS atypical AN, depending on how strict the criteria of who ever were to diagnose me were. 

edit: Wanted to add, I'm not trying to invalidate anyone. If you say you have anorexia, I'm not going to say you don't. Just because you wouldn't be able to get a clinical diagnosis doesn't make you less valid. Though I will say, don't be fixate on the labels. You don't want to be anorexic, being anorexic will not make your problems more legitimate. I used to secretly want to develop AN because I thought it would make my issues more real/valid/legit and people would take my issues more seriously. No matter what eating disorder you have, your condition is just as serious and legitimate as anorexia. You don't have to develop full-blown anorexia to justify seeking out the help you need. Please don't wait for your physical condition to deteriorate to dangerous levels before getting help, you deserve the help you need, just as you are right now.

edit2: (as if this comment wasn't long enough already) I just wanted to explain for anyone who's curious, the point of a clinical atypical anorexia diagnosis isn't that you have all the psycological requirements for anorexia, you just lack the behavioral/physical symptoms. That would likely be diagnosed as non-specified EDNOS. The clinical intent behind an atypical anorexia diagnosis is that you have all the behavioral symptoms, you just aren't severely underweight YET. It's meant for sufferers who just haven't had anorexia for long enough for it to be clinically considered full-blown anorexia. To be diagnosed with atypical anorexia, for most doctors, you still have to be dropping weight at an alarming/unhealthy rate.

edit3: As much as eating disorders really are more psycological than physical, to the medical industry, they aren't. The medical community defines them more as behavioral/physical disorders than mental ones. If they didn't, diagnosis criteria wouldn't require the physical/behavioral symptoms. But at least for now, they do.

edit4: This comment is already crazy long, so I might as well keep going. The point of the anorexia weight requirement isn't to invalidate anyone or dismiss anyone's emotional distress. It's to separate out the people who are at the highest risk for an early death so they can get the appropriate treatment needed to prevent that death. Yes any ED is a risk to your health and everyone deserves the help they need to conquer it, it's just that anorexia takes priority because it has the highest death rate."

I don't get it, because even in the absence of ""weight stigma"" and ""bullying"", I was still physically uncomfortable. Even if no one tells you that being overweight is bad, you can still feel it. How can so many people go on so long lying to themselves?"
WeightLossAdvice,fpzuf9x,t1_fpzk3j4,1589023820.0,"Sorry but there is no shortcut. With weightloss, it's all about the calorie deficit, which isn't super achievable through exercise alone. That and sustainable weightloss takes time and patience. You're going to have to both change your diet and be willing to wait for what you want. If you're not willing to put in the work to change your lifestyle, your body isn't going to change either. Even if you do some extreme dieting/exercise and lose a lot of weight in a short amount of time, when you resume your previous habits, the weight will go back on."

If my partner suddenly lost a ton of weight, my head would be realing with thoughts like ""what if he feels like he's out of my league now"", ""what if he doesn't find me attractive anymore"", ""what if he leaves me for a skinny girl who he can exercise with"", ""people in public are going to think he's with me out of pitty. Is he with me out of pitty?"", ""if he could do it, I could. But I didn't. I'm the worst"", ""I look gross compared to him now, there's no way he doesn't find me gross"". Then I would feel guilty for not being supportive and feel like a bad spouse. None of these feelings would be my partners fault, and he would even try over and over again to assure me none of it was true. But the feelings and thoughts would persist.

fatlogic,fpqma5t,t1_fppy3bw,1588826180.0,"I've noticed a few HAES people diagnosing themselves with eating disorders and then using that as a shield. Like ""I can't ever try to lose weight because it would trigger my atypical anorexia"" and stuff. It's tricky because I don't think they're all full of crap, but at least some of them clearly are, which is such a crappy thing to do. Also now that binge eating and food addiction are becoming more widely known and accepted, some of them are hiding behind that. Like ""I have a disorder so it's not my fault, not my problem, and there's nothing I can do about it"". It's frustrating because having a disorder doesn't mean everything is out of your hands and you're just a victim. You can fight it, you can work on getting the help you need. Having a disorder doesn't mean you're 100% powerless. For some of these people it just feels like a really convinient excuse to shift the blame and justify giving up. I'm not here to start pointing fingers and telling people they don't have disorders or judging the severity of their issues. I'm just saying it's something that I've seen a lot of these people hide behind like it's some sort of defense, which just feels wrong and sometimes disingenuous.

Also a lot of HAES people seem to really want to lump themselves in with eating disorder sufferers. I think they think it makes them look more legit? And, to be fair, there is a noteworthy amount of overlap in the communities.

edit: I also wanted to add, I've seen HAES people claiming that basically everyone and anyone with any interest in intentionally losing weight has an eating disorder. So there's that whole thing.

edit2: Wanted to add that Adele's weightloss pic has genuinely triggered a few people in the ED community, but I have yet to see any ED people trying to blame Adele for it. She's just a woman living her life, she bares no responsibility for everyone else's mental health."

I've read that Asian people are genetically at higher risk for things like high blood pressure, and that it's the main reason a typical Asian diet is much less fattening than the kind of diet you tend to find in other places, and it's why weight stigma has always been much stricter there. 

I think the recent boom of diet craziness in Asia is a response to Western influence. As things like fast food restaurants and snacking make their way over Asian, it's becoming tougher for many Asians to maintain the types of slim physiques that used to come more naturally."

fatlogic,fpdzan4,t3_gctv2b,1588537232.0,"The conversation about doctors is something I'm more loaded on than most. I always hated getting weighed by doctors because it was like ""dude, I already know I'm fat, and I already hate myself for it. You lecturing me about it is only going to make me feel worse"", but I get why they have to do it, I guess some people actually don't know they're fat or are in denial and need someone to talk them out of it. It's complicated though, one time my usual doctor wasn't around so I met with a different one. This one genuinely mistreated me and mildly assalted me because of my weight, I'm still terrified of doctors today because of it. And I have an eating disorder, so there have been times when stepping on a scale or having someone talk to me about my weight was just something I was too emotionally fragile to handle. So I get having doctors and weight being a loaded thing for you, and feeling like maybe you need to even refuse to be weighed at a check up. But it should never be normalized or encouraged, especially for obese people. Also it should be for legitimate reasons beyond just being in denial of modern medicine. People in denial are probably the ones who need the weigh-in and talking-to the most."

I'm usually down for kindness and wholesomeness, but it gets dangerous when we start pretending problems don't exist because the acknowlegement of those problems hurts peoples feelings. We've complacently let companies take fattening foods and junk from something special to something normal to an addiction.

AnorexiaNervosa,fpb0gny,t3_gc9feg,1588459520.0,"I've never been underweight, so I'm always nervous to say I have anorexia. But same, I most likely have undiagnosed anorexia b/p subtype. I think my intake just hasn't been low enough consistently enough for my weight to get real low. For a long time my main issues were BED and bullimia, leading to weight cycling. But throughout the past 6 months, it's transitioned into anorexia. Recently I've noticed some suspicious pains as well as abnormally heavy hair fallout in the shower. Also I'm always cold, shakey, and dizzy, but those things aren't new. Really A lot of the health problems are because of intake/deficiency rather than weight, you don't have to be underweight to suffer from symptoms. 

Suffering from anorexia without being underweight is not that strange. Recently I learned of abnormal anorexia, where all the thought processes are there just not all the behaviors. It's a new category to allow for an anorexia diagnosis in people who aren't underweight. And I get it, if anorexia is a mental disorder, why do we define/characterize it so much through it's behavioral and physical symptoms? I'm not saying that that's what you have, just that you're not alone in this. We are many, we are just a quiet many because when someone who isn't underweight says they have anorexia people get mad."

The cereal because when burning out and coming down from a really, really bad binge I tend to cry curled up in bed while munching on something bland, carby, and comforting.
