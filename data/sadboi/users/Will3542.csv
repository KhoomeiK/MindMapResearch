RoastMe,feb51i8,t3_eo2ib6,1578955482.0,I don’t have to. You did it to yourself.
therewasanattempt,fe3jg1k,t3_enlup8,1578849773.0,Why do I feel as if this was made by the owner of the other car?
millionairemakers,fbimrw6,t3_edhj2m,1576905932.0,Happy Holidays!
AskReddit,ezuo2aq,t3_d28ayo,1568156937.0,But wait... that’s me
AskMen,eym8j5g,t3_cxg8r5,1567202203.0,I had a paintball hit my left nut. I was on the ground in extreme pain for a while.
teenagers,exif5p2,t3_csx2pu,1566327053.0,Good luck ♥️
bipolar,exi7qtj,t1_exgrg3c,1566322754.0,It definitely feels as if I’ll explode if I try and sit still. Shark analogy on point.
bipolar,exi7m23,t1_exgq6pn,1566322679.0,I’m extremely worried about the crash that will follow.
bipolar,exi7kdi,t1_exhvf4l,1566322652.0,I was just thinking about it and it seems as if our minds don’t have a healthy way to deal with stress. Everything goes on overload with whatever we do.
SuicideWatch,ew8v1jm,t3_cnbqv2,1565215594.0,"I’m not sure if this will help, but I understand feeling different. Not too long ago, I was so focused on trying to make friends and getting people to like me that I realized it was me who didn’t have anything going on. I found hobbies and focused on myself and I’ll tell you, the amount of people who have started talking to me just to go hang out and do something... it’s 180. I just want to get the point across that you don’t have to fit in. Focus on what you enjoy and people will come. Hope this helps."
bipolar,euewmlg,t1_euet6mr,1563755997.0,I’m taking this energy to the gym. May as well put it somewhere useful.
SuicideWatch,euczihf,t3_cfpj9u,1563693528.0,"I hate being vulnerable, I can’t even begin to imagine going through that. If you ever want to talk with a stranger, I’m right here for you."
SuicideWatch,etblv3u,t3_cavu6p,1562651434.0,"It’s not on others to give a shit. I’m sorry to say that, but it isn’t. I don’t give a shit about myself or anything I do. I just don’t. Look at that, I’m talking about myself, fuckin whatever. 

You don’t have to set your standards to what anyone else wants. You fucking set your standards for yourself. If you can’t reach a certain goal or don’t think you’re doing enough, then set a lower goal. Set it for yourself. That’s what the fuck I’m doing and you can do it too. Pm me if you want to talk because apparently “no one here fucking cares.”"
bipolar,et6pssp,t3_ca7tz1,1562517202.0,You will do great! Don’t overthink things :) I believe in you ♥️
SuicideWatch,et58rcc,t3_ca0ydf,1562466997.0,That’s amazing to hear! Keep fighting the battle with us. ♥️
bipolar,esz5eqc,t1_esw6yc7,1562355504.0,Thank you
confession,esjyzkz,t3_c84pnx,1562045981.0,"I was super anti-smoking weed, until I tried it. Now, every once in a while it’s a good way to just kick back and relax. My favorite is to listen to music and fall asleep."
bipolar,esjysu4,t3_c84u02,1562045819.0,I’ve honestly not laughed this hard in a while.
bipolar,esjx9i1,t3_c84tcm,1562044500.0,It really do be like that.
bipolar,esjw87f,t3_c84rt5,1562043655.0,"Hey, I almost ended myself tonight, but thanks to one person, I didn’t. I want to pay that forward and say that if anyone needs someone to talk to, I’m right here."
bipolar,esjvk7r,t3_c83s9j,1562043122.0,I really wish it would just stop.
bipolar,esjvh5n,t3_c7wwus,1562043051.0,"Always end up feeling like no one can touch me, until I realize it’s all just mania."
bipolar,esjvdtp,t3_c80zkc,1562042978.0,"It’s like, just end me at this point."
bipolar,esjvbvz,t3_c82ye0,1562042936.0,I’m pretty sure this is how it is with us
SuicideWatch,esju6fq,t1_esjt4db,1562042028.0,I wouldn’t dare harm anyone other than me. Thank you for the kind words. I’m trying to hold on.
SuicideWatch,esjrcy8,t3_c8494k,1562039893.0,Maybe another night I guess
politics,esjosbc,t3_c7xhoz,1562038055.0,None of this is worth it
bipolar,es8jcdk,t1_eruopm2,1561700057.0,I’m all for trying something new to learn. It’s definitely a struggle though. I end up putting too many things down only after a few weeks. I often wonder if it’s me being manic and just trying something new due to the energy or if I’m genuinely interested in it.
bipolar,es8ief9,t1_erugqzj,1561699042.0,Thank you for this. I really appreciate it.
pcmasterrace,es1ohg5,t3_c57nwv,1561501704.0,Would be pretty neat!
