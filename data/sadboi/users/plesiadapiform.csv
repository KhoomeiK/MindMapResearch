TwoXChromosomes,fnaff6o,t1_fna253v,1586796555.0,"I mean, all documentaties have a bias, even trying to be entirely unbiased is not possible. But theres a big difference between say, I am a killer (or whatever that death row series on Netflix is called) and Tiger King. Tiger King was very obviously biased and sensationalized, especially if you read up on it afterwards. They definitely try to paint Joe as just this wacky mostly harmless dude and Carole Baskin is very clearly 'the good guy' in reality, despite her flaws but they really left a lot undefended by her there and painted her as just as bad as the roadside zoo people. I know when we watched my boyfriend was under the impression she was exactly the same as Joe Exotic and Doc Antle (""she has so much money and she's exploiting volunteers the same as the other guys""). 


Compare that to the other doc series I mentioned. I watched one episode and they took tge death row inmates story and made him out to be pretty sympathetic (he didn't commit the murder but got charged with murder because he was a getaway driver basically), and they talked to his father who is trying to get him off death row. But they also talked to the murder victims family and some officials and got their side of it and why they think he should stay on death row. It was pretty slanted in favor of taking the man off death row as far as I remember, but it was framed in a way that the other side of the argument was clear as well. 



Tiger King was all sensationalized bullshit. It had nothing to say about the treatment of the cats really, it was just ""look at all these wacky people doing wacky things wow aren't they wild."" I loved every minute of that trainwreck, but I didn't learn anything and ultimately felt like I wasted the hours I spent watching it."

PSA the 15th is child tax, and the 30th is welfare so those days will also likely be quite busy regardless of what time you go in. When I worked retail Tuesday evenings were almost always the least busy days. I don't know how mass unemployment/closures have effected that, but I've been getting groceries after supper on Tuesdays and the stores have not been quite as packed."

getting_over_it,fizknuh,t1_fiy48ch,1582865472.0,"To piggyback this: any sort of sleeptime routine will help prime your brain for sleep. I was having really awful sleep and I implemented a routine that starts 1 hour before bedtime, that includes sleepy tea and no more phone/tv for the night. I also listen to a sleep podcast (sleep with me) which I find helps a lot. 


I also used an app to calculate when I should set my alarm to be between sleep cycles. And the app I use for alarms is called alarmy. It lets you set a mission like scanning a particular barcode so it forces you to get up to shut the alarm off. 


I'm sorry friend. Take some time to look after yourself. You got this. I've been on short term disability for 3 months due to suicidal ideation. In December I just wanted to die. Today I had a moment where I was genuinely glad to still be alive. Just gotta hold on for those moments, and remember them on the bad days. Hugs ❤"
bulletjournal,fizbos9,t1_fiyy3g3,1582858824.0,Ooh thank you! I'll have to try that. I have a couple times just smudged everything beyond repair but I've gotten a bit better at like. Raising up my hand more and only smudging bits haha
bulletjournal,fiyxsmj,t1_fiyrscm,1582849425.0,Yeah they have so many fun colors! I've just got a black one and a pink one lol. Yeah that makes sense! There's definitely a learning curve involved haha. I'm hoping that I'll be able to learn to at least somewhat mitigate the smudging
bulletjournal,fiyqfc2,t1_fiygq36,1582844641.0,How do you like the gelly roll pens? I love the way they write and how they look but I think I am Too Left handed to be able to use them as much as I would like to
Breath_of_the_Wild,fiym63t,t1_fiylxwe,1582842147.0,"Haha true, but when they stick their tongue out and start followin you around all happy they are sooo cute"
Breath_of_the_Wild,fiyiw6o,t1_fiy88kh,1582840278.0,I got the monster masks from kilton and seeing the bokoblin get all excited and follow me around made me sooo sad lol
sixthemusical,fixmznz,t1_fixmhnb,1582823335.0,"Right? Especially with all the new princess movies/remakes shoving in girlboss power ballads lol. 

I think Hamilton. I'm not generally a big pop fan which certainly plays into it, usually I listen to Six around the house or on my commute when I want to just jam out. And I tend to skip Janes song and Catherine Parrs because they are slower than I want when I'm in a Six mood. I don't skip anything when I listen to Hamilton"
sixthemusical,fixm3nw,t1_fixd9bf,1582822817.0,"I don't know that either is better than the other. They are very very different. Hamiltons soundtrack basically tells the whole story, while I had to look up the plot of Six to understand what was going on after I listened to the soundtrack. Both are great for very different reasons and in very different ways 

My sister described Six to me as ""Hamilton meets a Disney Princess movie"" lol"
zelda,fivta0o,t1_fiv21xq,1582767567.0,"I loved that it was not super difficult. I'm bad at games and I felt like I was challenged, but it wasn't too difficult to move forward. I never got stuck for a long time on one thing (although I did screw around a lot before I took on the divine beasts. Really the only thing that I wanted to be maybe a teensy bit harder was ganon. 

That said I can appreciate that some people like difficult combat. If they do make the next one harder I hope its an option to change the difficulty. I play games to chill and having to replay the same fight 100 times is not chill for me lol"
Breath_of_the_Wild,finw52z,t1_finvzk7,1582571376.0,Yeah haha that side quest was a huge pain. There is a bunch right around the stable though too which helps. I definitely prefer just getting luminous stones and trading them to the Zora lol
Breath_of_the_Wild,finmcho,t1_fimjbj5,1582565919.0,Theres also the guy at the stable at the entrance to Gerudo desert that will give you a diamond for 55 rushrooms
CanadaPolitics,fi426wt,t1_fi41cxf,1582132470.0,"Its not really as easy as that because the injustices of the system are still in effect. Intergenerational trauma is tricky. A lot of that is from years and years ago, but it still effects people today. Those trauma cycles need to be broken, but I don't know how to do that. More services on reserve would be a start. 

Progress is being made, but I really don't think its enough progress to say ""reconciliation is done; we've reconciled; its history now."" I think that a lot of it is talk, there isn't enough action. For example, people on reserve need more basic services like healthcare and mental health care, especially in remote communities. But I don't know how to make that happen. 

According to an August 2019 report boil water advisories are expected to be entirely fixed by March 2021."
CanadaPolitics,fi3yfx0,t1_fi3xjmf,1582130274.0,"I don't really have a dog in this fight. Sure I can be called a white colonialist settler and that might hurt my feelings and make me feel a bit indignant because /I/ didn't do anything and /I'm/ not racist.

 But the reality is is that this isn't really history yet. Sure a lot of the really really bad stuff is history. We don't do residential schools anymore. Lots of native children are still taken from their homes and put with white foster families though. I don't know how to fix that, but it is an issue. Reserves don't have adequate health care, safe water, etc. Thats an issue. The last residential school closed in 1996. The abuse suffered by survivors of that system is intergenerational because there are absolutely not enough supports for them. Mental health care doesn't really exist on reserves. 


So I don't know what the timeline is. But we aren't at a point where we can say ""its in the past, let it stay there"". We can't really just try to sweep this under the rug because we personally don't have the power to change it/didn't have a part in it/they should just move on because it was years ago. But it wasn't. They are still suffering the effects of what we, as a country, did to them not all that long ago and the government is not doing enough to fix it."
CanadaPolitics,fi3wb3l,t1_fi3ipny,1582129010.0,The last residential school closed in 1996. You were almost definitely alive.
minimalism,fi21lal,t3_f5szrs,1582069393.0,"The Power by Naomi Alderman. I just read this book and I love it so much. I want everyone to read it. It was great. The first book I actually could not put down in a long time. 

The basic premise is that at some point in the present times all women get like. Electric eel powers. The book is a manuscript that a man has written 5000 years in the future about what he thought happened when The Power started manifesting, and its bookended by letters between him and the woman he has sent the manuscript to. The letters were actually my favorite part. It was an incredible read and an interesting look at society and the patriarchy and what happens when the power balance shifts."
