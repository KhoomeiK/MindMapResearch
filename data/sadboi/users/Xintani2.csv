See, I matured enough to be able to critically analyze myself, I was diagnosed ASPD. After being able to see my wrongs, I was diagnosed BPD.

So in your example:

The subject (us) feels overwhelming pain and confusion. We are terrified of the relationships around us and we feel the urge to put an end to it all because it is simply too much. We feel no one cares about us. 

Stop the scenario here for a moment. The above is what I define as a ‚Äúsymptom‚Äù. 

Now, we have choices: Call up your friends and tell them they don‚Äôt care about you. Call your psychologist. Go on here or any of the number of free online resources we have to talk about it. Read a book. Do some DBT. Meditate. Think critically about how to illustrate that you need help productively to a friend. 

All of the above are *decisions*.


Let‚Äôs say that in the heat of the moment I do actually just call up my friends and scream at them.

I agree so, so much with you. Working through trauma can be so utterly confusing and I‚Äôve definitely noticed this as well; sitting around thinking about every single thing you do as ‚Äúbad‚Äù seems to create more problematic behaviors than anything. 

Before I was diagnosed, I saw the world as evil. After diagnosis, I saw myself as evil. After time, I‚Äôm beginning to see that it is all just gray. I struggle now with suicidality; The urge to self destruct the moment I feel hopeless. I hope to get to where you are at some point."

My point is that the pain of BPD is a symptom, but hurting others is an action and a decision. 

As I said in the post, I‚Äôm not sitting on a moral high horse. I specifically struggle with how my suicidal ideation hurts those that care about me. The suicidality is a symptom. But the vocalization of it is something I am 100% accountable of. My disorder does not get to take credit for it.

BPD,fp10ytk,t1_fp10ha6,1588221542.0,"Yes! I‚Äôve been on both sides;

I used to be overweight and kind of beat myself down into believing that no one would ever find me attractive and so I began thinking about beautiful women from the perspective of someone that would never ‚Äúwin‚Äù in the dating game. So I started seeing beautiful women for what they were; beautiful. It has nothing to do with me. 


I ended up losing the weight and sometimes girls are quite nasty to me now ironically enough. But my ability to appreciate beauty for what it is without glorifying it is probably one of my best qualities now. 


There will be pretty girls worth your time; there will be pretty girls that are ugly underneath and not worth your time. But seeing other women as competition to you is such a lose, lose situation. 

Some of my favorite people in the world just happen to be beautiful beyond belief. I see it; I recognize that they are much more beautiful than I am. But if I judged them with jealousy I would have missed out big time.

This is because years ago there was a published article on a meta analysis of SSRI's that found a large amount of bias in the studies, leaving the efficacy of the drug clouded. The clinical significance vs. statistical significance of SSRI's is a very, very common knowledge debate going on in the scientific community and if you want to learn more about it, you can research it on your own. 

I was studying Neuroscience back in the day and so the topic was fresh in my mind but honestly I don't care to sit here and debate if scientists find the efficacy of SSRI's questionable or not because they do. They are *still* figuring it out. As the user above said, this is common knowledge.
