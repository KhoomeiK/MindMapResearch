And our rational, logical minds are just observers watching our emotions driving recklessly causing trouble and turmoil! We’ve got to practice taking that pause, letting your emotions be there and be what they are, but pausing before reacting. Just to name the emotion. Taking notice of your emotions can actually do a lot to turn them down to be less amplified in the moment. You don’t have to do anything with your emotions, you don’t have to change them, just pause, let them be there, and name it to tame it."
