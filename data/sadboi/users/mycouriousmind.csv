relationships,fg949h4,t1_fg7vk5d,1580634073.0,It's nothing like that..It is not that I tell him or call him then I threat him to self harm myself. I do it even nobody even knows. You are just judging me n I have isolated from people because of these judgement. They never understand. All I meant or all I wanted a support or mental strength to pull me out of this pain along the help of my psychiatrist and therapist.. I never ever mentioned I want my boyfriend as my counselor or anything..I really have nobody around. So I wanted him as I had panic attacked that's it. Just like other person you misunderstood as an attention seeker. That's what others do when they understand the meaning of depression
