Previous place was a fancy old block of flats near Baker Street that my ex chose for us. It was ~¬£1100 for our room (which was half of the old living room partitioned off) with a dining table jammed in the windowless hallway. An absolute ripoff (thank you, letting agency), especially as there were 7 of us in what had originally been a 3 bed flat. 

I also lived in a few ex-council houses that had absolutely no living space at all and way too many people. One place I lived in Shadwell had a couple living under the stairs with curtains and sheets hanging up around to partition it off.
