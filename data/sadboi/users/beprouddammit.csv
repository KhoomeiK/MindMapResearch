My last boyfriend told me multiple times how much he hates his ex (she cheated on him while he was away for work) but yet would always text and call her. It really hurt. Especially because he would rarely call me/answer my calls. He would always tell me how much he hated her yet was always talking to her.

BorderlinePDisorder,fqhoq2v,t1_fqhnd99,1589381326.0,"No problem! :) I would definitely suggest seeing someone if you are concerned. 

And how do I cope with mood swings? Well there is Dialectical Behavior Therapy which is used for a lot of BPD patients to help them learn how to regulate their moods. You can look into it to learn about it but there are a lot of skills and if you do see a professional they can definitely help you with those skills. It is best to work with it with a professional:)"
BorderlinePDisorder,fqhnokh,t3_giwqd6,1589380708.0,"First off, it's great that you're recognizing your behaviors and issues! I'm happy you're able to do that. If you are concerned, it's definitely worth talking to someone. You seem willing to work on things and change for the better so it could be very beneficial in the long run.

I can really relate to the obsessive thoughts and emotions. I recommend you also look into ""cognitive distortions"" and see if you can relate to them. They're not BPD specific (anyone can have them even without a mental illness) but recognizing them and combatting them really, really, really helps me when I feel the way you're describing. 

Btw, sorry but how you said your sister said you got angry for a ""stupid reason"" got to me haha. Your feelings are valid and real! They may be irrational sometimes and not reflect true reality (it happens to me, too) but therapy can help you with that if you do pursue it.

Good luck! üíï"

What helps me in this situation is radical acceptance. Accepting he hasn't texted back, acknowledging how it makes me feel, and then ""throwing the feeling away"". I imagine my feelings as pieces of paper and crumple it up and throw it away. Sometimes it takes just one toss, other times I gotta repeat it again and again. I then like to remind myself what has happened in the past when I tried texting him about him not replying and how it blew the situation up even more and made me feel worse.

Sometimes it's easy. Sometimes it takes every bit of me to accept it and let it be. 

Also, like someone else said, I try to remember something about him that isn't favorable or a time where he hurt me. Dont think of something drastic or traumatic, but something small.

I dated this guy for about a month a few years ago. We didnt keep in touch and I forgot about it. About 6 months after breaking up, he randomly said all this truly horrible, horrible, horrible completely false shit about me on Facebook. On his statuses and in some videos he posted. I called him out on it. His friend called me psycho. I blocked the guy. 

Now last May. He randomly texts me (I obviously didn't have his number saved, but he's had mine this whole time???) and asks me why I hate him and if I'm single. Mind you, we hadn't talked in almost 2 years. I told him ""I dont care anymore, I forgot about you and no I'm not single"". I also ask him why he wants to know that and I never got a reply.

Now to a few weeks ago. I get an email from instagram saying that he followed me. Now, I dont use Instagram anymore but I still have my account. My account is my first and last name and I have zero pictures posted. I only used it to follow other people. He HAD to have looked up my name to find my Instagram. Theres no way I would have been 'suggested' to him. I look at his Instagram and find out he's fucking engaged and has been for a long time!!!

Most of the time, I dont talk about something ""important"" that will ""force"" him to keep talking nor do I go to the other extreme of pushing him away to get him to keep talking. It's mostly just me pulling random things out of my ass to talk about no matter how ""irrelevant"" it is, I will talk about it all to avoid him hanging up and me hearing the sound of him disconnecting the call and having to be by myself again. 

Idk if this relates what you're talking about, but I think it's a bit different because I'm not always going to drastic measures to keep him on the phone. I find the most trivial of things to talk about for another hour."

You wouldn't want a physical illness because that wouldn't fit your ""aesthetic"" or be ""quirky."" Whyyyy are people so fixated on wanting something to be wrong with their damn brain???

My response to those wanting BPD..... take mine. Please. I wanna be normal. I wanna not ruin every relationship because I'm so scared of them leaving me that they actually fucking leave me. I wanna not be convinced everyone hates me. I wanna not constantly apologize for bothering everyone with my existence. I wanna not dissociate and have people look at me like I'm a fucking exhibit. I wanna not get triggered over the slightest change in tone and spend the rest of my day spiraling down to hell. I wanna not feel every damn emotion like I'm getting smacked in the face with a damn iron frying pan with it. And that's only the very tippy top of the iceberg of things I dont want. I wanna be a normal fucking person. Please. Take it."
BPD,fogz902,t1_fogxly6,1587758694.0,"Well it's nice to know someone can relate to that as well :) as shitty of a feeling it is. It's always nice to not feel alone. And yeah, it can be. I'm sorry that video made you feel so bad. The youtuber definitely should've had a warning. Hang in there üíïüíï"
BPD,fogutsl,t3_g7bzls,1587757225.0,"I am so so so sorry he said that and did that to you. My heart hurt to hear all that. I just want you to know that it is NOT your fault. The reason he gave you for cheating is disgusting. He is disgusting. Trust me, you are worth so much and so much more than that.

I had a boyfriend who would heavily imply he was gonna cheat and would get me all riled up but when I would actually get upset at him, he would call me a ""psycho bitch who needs to learn how to take a joke."" He would do this frequently.

Obviously that's not as bad as your situation, but just know that it's not our fault if we feel threatened. Someone who actually loves you will make you feel safe. You really deserve better and I really hope you get it."
BPD,fogsmjq,t3_g7djua,1587756514.0,"For sure. In fact, even ""positive"" things can trigger me like that. If I hear a girl talking about how amazing her boyfriend is and how much he cares and how he does all these things for her, I will lose my shit. It reminds me that I've never had a boyfriend who gave a shit about me like that. Looking back, it hurts so much but I've never had a boyfriend care and actually try. I've been mentally abused and emotionally neglected by guys, so hearing a girl talk about her ""amazing"" boyfriend can send me into a  deep spiral."
BPD,fogrifj,t3_g7dt1n,1587756153.0,"I understand you completely. When I think of recovery, I think of someone going through something that has a definite end point. Like recovering from an injury or illness or even drug abuse. I don't really relate recovery to mental illness. Sure, people can work on themselves and get to a point where they feel their mental illness no longer hinders them. And that's great! But, for most people, mental illnesses are a lifelong thing. There is no cure, only ways to manage symptoms. In fact, this mindset is the same one that made me refuse help and ""recovery"" for a while. I'm gonna have these mental illnesses for my whole life, so what's the point of getting help? But there came a point where it got so bad and I wanted help. I acknowledge that getting help will not cure me and I will never actually recover and that makes all the difference to me.

Sure, I still hate relapsing and losing any progress made but I'm learning to accept that as well and be ok with it because I will have to deal with this my whole life. Assuming you can fully recover from a mental illness is very daunting and it puts a lot of pressure on you. So me accepting that this is a life long battle and there is no end point, makes accepting relapses and setbacks easier.

I'm happy that you have come the realization that you did so that you can fight the way you need to."
BPD,fogac8n,t1_foduets,1587750022.0,"A ""chameleon"" describes it perfectly. My energy and personality always depends on the vibe I get with other people."
BPD,foga4us,t1_fofvxfc,1587749940.0,"Yes exactly! Paper cuts feeling like daggers when you know they are just paper cuts. I'm glad you understand, as horrible as it is."
BPD,fofca36,t3_g6l904,1587732525.0,"I feel the same way. I go through moments where I'm like, ""no, you dont have any mental illness. You're just a bitch. You're just a cu**.""

I never wanna use my MIs as excuses, but I just wanna accept that they're the reason for so many things so that I know how to cope and best work on myself. But I sometimes feel as if I'm a fraud too and the only thing ""wrong"" with me is that I'm a bitch."
BPD,focni55,t3_g6plmg,1587673460.0,"The very first time I tried bringing up my concern about having BPD to a professional, she straight up told me to not ""touch that one"" because if I was diagnosed with it, I would never be able to purchase/own a gun. Idk how true that its but I found it extremely irrelevant. I have no interest in having a gun. Never not once did I say anything about guns. Her reasoning sounded so irrelevant and random to me. She then followed that up with, ""all it sounds like to me is seasonal affective disorder.""

I've looked for people's specific experiences with emotional flashbacks and I can relate to some a bit. I just see that it relates to PTSD and C-PTSD which I don't relate to 100%. It is very interesting and I will look more into it, thank you."

hsp,fo7bu41,t1_fo7bd8e,1587575675.0,"Yes, definitely relate to all that as well! Texting can be so frustrating because most of the time you cant tell someone's tone or intention. I would love to just quit talking to everyone, but I wanna learn how to cope and build a healthy relationship with it as well."
hsp,fo7beva,t1_fo78bqz,1587575469.0,"I don't think we believe we are ""special snowflakes"", it's just that sometimes our minds convince us that no one else feels the way we do. Like I know I'm not the only one with depression and anxiety, but sometimes it feels like I am because I get hung up on how a ""normal"" person would react. It's very helpful to hear that someone else feels the way we do. In fact, most of the time we are looking for someone who does because we do not wanna be ""special snowflakes."""
BPD,fo7ad5y,t3_g5th5t,1587574961.0,"My ex bf was married before me. Though she single handedly caused the divorce, I had and still have nothing but envy for her. Even when him and I were dating, I HATED hearing him say ""my ex wife."" I wanted to be her. I knew all the destruction she caused, but I wanted to be her. I'd still rather be his ex wife than his ex girlfriend. She had that side of him I really want. Idk what's wrong with me."

hsp,fo79idw,t1_fo76jlm,1587574551.0,"Oh yes, I definitely struggle with the feeling of not being listened to with some people haha. For sure. I was talking on the phone with my ex boyfriend (we're on good terms) and I was trying to explain why one of his texts bothered me and how I felt it was negative. He said ""no, youre wrong. i meant what I said. Idk what you want me to say."" And I straight up said to him ""it would help if you told me 'I didn't mean the way you took it, I'm sorry if it came off that way, can I help you better understand it' instead of just telling me I'm wrong."" There was a long pause and he just says ""idk what you want me to say.""

Like I just told you something that can really help! Feeling invalidated and not listened to is big for me."
