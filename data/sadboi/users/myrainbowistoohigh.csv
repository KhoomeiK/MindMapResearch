It's annoying because I have bipolar 1 and I have to fight so hard for my happiness. When I was going through some bad depression someone told me ""we're all depressed "" ummm, no being unhappy with your life is not depression. It downplays the people who have a legit mental illness because people feel like it's trendy or something they should have. I don't want to be depressed, or manic, or have anxiety.

One night I had the worst headache of all. I took ibuprofen and extra strength Tylenol but I still woke up all night. I thought I pinched a nerve in my neck or something.

The next day I woke up with the worst headache of my life. I was trying to take Tylenol but I was violently vomiting. I waited a while but when it wasn't getting better I got my kids ready to go the ER. I had a weird feeling something was wrong. My grandma died of an aneurysm so frequent headaches, sudden worst headache of my life set off alarm bells.

I got to the hospital and I kept apologizing to the staff because I thought it was just a migraine. The doctor didn't want to waste my time doing a CT scan but after he talked to me he got a feeling and decided to do one just in case.

I had a full blown cerebellar stroke. I was only 30 so I was in total denial until I got moved to a bigger hospital and talked to the head neurologist. When I saw my MRI I was shocked, I lost about 70% of the right side of my cerebellum.

It makes me sad because if I had talked to my PCP or seen a headache specialist or even gone the night before it might not have happened at all.

I felt like I finally got to see the real person and it felt so good to see them embrace and love themselves. Haha it sounds silly because I'm hetero myself so I can't relate on a personal level but I have such a soft spot for that community. The bravery it takes to come out as trans really astounds me. I'm sure she would be able to give you some of her courage to help you have that talk. I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to wait until you're not under their roof anymore though. I really hope it will make him rethink things. ‚ù§Ô∏è So many good vibes to you!"
toastme,fi3yxc0,t3_f624di,1582130559.0,This is a weird compliment but you have the most perfect eyebrows I've ever seen in my life. Your freckles are so cute too and wow are your eyes gorgeous!
toastme,fi3yptc,t3_f641kn,1582130435.0,"My husband didn't have a girlfriend until he was 26 and was living with his parents when I met him haha. We have two beautiful kids and a house now. He was just extremely shy so I guess your case is a little different. I'm not going to encourage you to push yourself until you're ready but when you come out it's gonna feel so beautiful to let everything down and be yourself.

Every single person I know in the LGBT community (and I know a lot) is so unconditionally loving and accepting because they know how it feels to not have that and they don't want anyone to feel that way. ‚ù§Ô∏è If you do come out there's gonna be a wonderful community of people supporting you. Be your beautiful self and things will work out

Edit: also your curls are adorable!"

AskReddit,fi0i3mq,t3_f5stks,1582037497.0,"Red Dead Redemption 2 had such a huge impact on me. The main character Arthur reminds me of my dad so much, personality, looks and everything. My dad and I are super different but it gave me such a new appreciation for all the things he loves. Especially hunting and fishing (I'm a vegetarian). It was like seeing life through his perspective in such a weird way but it was beautiful. 

My dad can't play the game because he has macular degeneration in his eyes and it's absolutely heartbreaking to me because I know he would love it so much. When I play it I try to play it like he would and do all the things he would love for him."
AskReddit,fhzqqyc,t3_f5nf4r,1582007912.0,"I wasn't a kid, I was maybe 14/15 but my best friend and her sisters tried to poison her uncle's coffee with laxatives and a bunch of other random stuff we found in the kitchen/medicine cabinet. We got caught because we put in a slice of pepperoni that floated to the top.

In our defense he was very creepy. I was a C cup around then and none of my friends had boobs so he would talk about mine all the time. One time we were all swimming and he kept trying to untie my bathing suit suit top and when I finally had a nip slip he started making fun of me and drawing everyone's attention so yeah. He definitely had that poisoned coffee coming lol."

I chose one with starry night by Vincent van Gogh because it's a painting of the view from his room at the insane asylum. Someone with the same disease, turning his lowest moments into something beautiful really gives me hope every time I take my meds."
unpopularopinion,fhzpc75,t3_f5dea3,1582006464.0,Haha this happened to me one time when I was alone in the gym where each bathroom has a shower in it. I thought I was going to be murdered by a killer behind the shower curtain.
unpopularopinion,fhzp76k,t3_f5i676,1582006326.0,"YES THANK YOU. This is a huge pet peeve of mine so I try hard to make my husband feel spoiled on Valentine's day. I got him some small gifts, a box of chocolates and made him cheddar jalapeno pretzels and a salted caramel and chocolate tart. Guys do so much, a lot of men hold the family together and are a huge source of support. The love should go both ways üíó"

I was due on the 4th of July with my boy but I knew I would probably go early again so I was in a June group and a July one. I ended up being right, he came 2 weeks early just like his sister but I'm glad no one was policing my due date in the June group."
UnresolvedMysteries,fhzkj35,t3_f5bwix,1582002091.0,"I'm late but Jennifer Kesse's drives me absolutely insane. She was such a safe paranoid person, she did everything right and still went missing. The case is so frustrating, they got video of a suspect but it only took pictures every 3 seconds and in every shot their face was hidden by a post in the metal gate. Even NASA tried to help with the footage to the best of my memory. It's such an all around frustrating case"

unpopularopinion,fhgzoaz,t1_fhgpw3y,1581586746.0,I was actually wondering that. I've been a vegetarian for over half my life and when I tried the impossible burger I got super paranoid because it tasted like what I remembered meat tasting like (I haven't had a burger in well over a decade.) Everyone who eats meat tells me you can tell it's not the real thing though. How close is it? Is the texture the same?
AmItheAsshole,fhgz0rv,t1_fhg7121,1581585824.0,"That made me so sad because I think Asian babies are super adorable! Every baby deserves to be loved unconditionally, they're so sweet and innocent. It blows my mind that anyone would be superficial enough to make fun of a baby."

They scare me because they're reoccurring, I have a close family friend who passed out from hers and woke up on the old. I'm not sure what the treatment for them is but I think they can give you medication to manage them and monitor them. You just have to be careful because they can lead to a full stroke later on down the road."

YouShouldKnow,fhdy2l9,t1_fhdwl2x,1581507190.0,"That explains why they did an EKG of my heart in the hospital, I was wondering how it could cause a stroke. 

I kind of felt the same way, it helps me when I'm going through a cycle of depression. I'm bipolar so it happens a lot but now I look at it like I could have died but didn't. Every day is a gift and it helps me pull myself up more when I'm down."
YouShouldKnow,fhdjvdc,t1_fhdgzlp,1581488747.0,"I'm so happy! Everyone's experience is different depending on where it is, mine was in my cerebellum so I got off kind of lucky. He might have some nerve pain, I had it on the right side of my body but the more I used it the faster it went away. I also had trouble using that side because it felt more numb and uncoordinated at first. (I'm right handed so I couldn't sign my name and writing was very hard). I kind of accepted that I would always be that way but it got better too. He might need physical therapy depending on how bad his was but our brains are remarkable at healing. It's truly amazing to see. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
