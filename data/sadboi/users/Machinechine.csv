I used camping and going for runs as my excuse, and it doesn't have to be hardcore either. Try to give yourself a chance to unwind and forget about the stupid in life. Go for a walk without your phone. Or when summertime comes around, lose yourself in a paperback at the beach. Again, lose your phone here or wherever you choose.
