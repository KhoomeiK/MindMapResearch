&#x200B;

He broke the rule.

&#x200B;

It is completely irrelevant if Vettel is in control of his car or not.

&#x200B;

A footballer going for the ball slips and accidentally fouls a player. What happens? It's a foul, no one cares if the player had lost control or not he had committed the foul.

&#x200B;

Reading below it would appear to me Vettel broke a rule....whether it was on purpose or not is irrelevant.

&#x200B;

Should a car leave the track the driver  may re-join, however, this may only be done when it is safe to do so and without gaining any lasting advantage. At the absolute discretion of the race director a driver may be given the opportunity to give back the whole of any advantage he gained by leaving the track."
