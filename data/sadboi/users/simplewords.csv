AskReddit,fq7p942,t1_fq7h9a3,1589149451.0,It is not a gift if it comes with strings attached. That's why it isn't good to accept gifts from people like that. If there's conditions that need to be met to accept something then it is more like a chore than a gift.
Anxiety,fpk19wr,t3_gdwcei,1588685939.0,"Yeah definitely. With everyone home I don't get alone time anymore unless I sit outside. 

My family are noisy and I can't really handle it for long periods of time. I dont need a dark room yet but it does make me want to cry. They're just there living their lives but every noise they make is just like a cheese grater scraping on my nerves."

I can't do many of the activities that usually help me cope with my anxiety so I've been struggling a little bit with finding replacements but I'm getting there. 

I'm just tired. Of work, the news, isolation, being stuck with my family."

BipolarReddit,fn74vdg,t1_fn633i8,1586713331.0,">At some point in our friendship, outside of the bi-polar, their lives shifted, their priorities shifted. From what I know they were under a lot of stress. So it's not so much your fault as it is that people have the ability to choose who and what they invest their time. When push comes to shove I have not found many people who are willing to go out of their way to help someone, let alone ""friends"". 

I think this is important too. It sucks to lose friends, but sometimes they also have things going on and can't be the friends that we need. I think this happens to many people even without mental illness in the mix."

I was supposed to start working with the Census as well, but that has been postponed too. 

My chest has been aching with anxiety for the past 2 weeks and I wake up with panic attacks sometimes. I am not having a good time."

Yes I'll do that tomorrow. I'm feeding him the same food he was eating at his previous residence but you never know with some things. It would be good to check anyway."
Pets,fh6ei05,t1_fh62mz9,1581297929.0,Because I just got him? He's already very nervous and anxious. I didnt want to add surgery so soon to the mix.
Pets,fh6e977,t1_fh6dctd,1581297843.0,Yeah I had hoped to do that later on once he got more acclimated to me and my family and the house. He's still eating normally.
Pets,fh6e2y1,t1_fh6ai26,1581297782.0,I think I'll bring in a stool sample first before scheduling an appointment then. I really dont want to add any more stress for him by bringing him to the vet unnecessarily if that ends up being the problem.
