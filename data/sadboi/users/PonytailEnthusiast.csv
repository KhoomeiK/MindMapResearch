magiarecord,fozpa6s,t1_fozozl2,1588194491.0,"I think a vn story might be closer to a book, and still in books you dont see ""hey what's up?"" ""I'll tell you about it at the cafe..."" over and over. Again, I like this game. But to pretend the writing doesn't have its weak points is just intellectually dishonest"
magiarecord,foy5i3n,t1_foy579q,1588165780.0,"Yes they do in real life. In fiction though, thats boring and they literally teach you this in writing classes to be sparing with this.  Why do you think in movies you rarely see people saying hello, how are you, what would you like to talk about before getting into a discussion on the phone? Because they do this in real life but that slows down the pace of a movie. 

I would argue people dont do it in real life as often as they do in this game. Sometimes it's like hey why the long face? Meet me at the cafe in an hour so we can discuss. It's really egregious."
magiarecord,foy4rnn,t1_foxtsn4,1588165291.0,"Quite honestly I find it a little strange how strongly people in this sub will defend the at times shoddy writing in this game.

For one there are WAY TOO MANY ""hang on, let's go to a caf√©/my place to dump some exposition"" moments. I find this to be the case in a lot of anime communities.
