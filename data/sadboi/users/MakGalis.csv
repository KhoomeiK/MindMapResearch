I really hate how I'm living rn, my brother is an addict and I feel guilty as fuck whenever I do drugs when I party. I'm just living too fast at the moment, I need someone or something to calm me down and something that takes away the feeling that I need to get fucked up once a week to clear my head.

Oh and my brother's ex texted me when I was drunk telling me she loves me, it's so complicated because I'm super close friends with her and I also have feelings for her.
