It’s gotten some better over time. I don’t expect it will ever go away, but I’ve decided I’m not letting this thing jerk me around all the time and I fight it. Of course, I still use my earplugs and headphones from time to time. But like with any affliction of the mind, not letting it have the final say over your happiness is key!"

misophoniasupport,fqt106b,t3_gkptfe,1589626203.0,"My husband and I rent a basement apartment from his parents and my MIL closing the bathroom door upstairs without turning the handle makes me angry every time. Also when she runs up the stairs loudly. Also whenever she drops something on the floor, which seems to be often. Also whenever their dog jumps off the bed and sounds like a bowling ball falling on the floor. 


Panic or anger about sounds is most likely misophonia. The only suggestions I can offer is trying to figure out the circumstances surrounding when you get the most anxious. Did you get enough sleep? Did you eat something that didn’t make you feel good? Do you have some other physical need or circumstance making you anxious? Take care of those things first and your anxiety may lessen some. Other suggestion is something I think I actually read here. Whenever you get triggered, actively relax your entire body and focus only on that. It helps lessen the tenseness in your mind. 


I’m sorry you’re going through this. Misophonia is a painful mean curse to deal with."
