Uranium has a far greater power density than any resource we know of at the moment. But I think comparing the death per kilowatt only provides a strong argument against fossil fuels.

unpopularopinion,fqnrzij,t3_gjk3mk,1589500296.0,"I'm going to be honest here, a person getting an A+ most likely has some sort of networking skills and charisma.  Getting that high of a grade requires going out and getting help from professors and other people. And it may be different at other schools but at my University, they make you take classes that essentially force you to make connections. But yes, this is true. I don't even think this is an opinion. I believe it's a fact that can be proven.

Edit: I should clarify that this is probably dependent on your major. Some majors are not as hard as others. And some people may be smart enough to not have to get help but a majority of people need that extra guidance to succeed academically."

unpopularopinion,fql4u0e,t1_fql3xkz,1589446282.0,"You're going on a victim complex here. I said nothing close to men dominating women but you keep pulling it out of thin air. A strawman fallacy. And I said those examples demonstrate the logic you use for not HITTING A PERSON. Notice how a person includes all genders. Another thing, I said to follow the logic used for each situation. The logic was "" You don't do this, because this can possibly happen"". That is literally something you learn as a toddler. Don't play with matches or you can get burned. Sound familiar? You keep picking apart each example rather than actually fighting the core idea being displayed from all of them. You keep dancing around it, and then you turn it into something about men dominating women? My suggestion to you, grow up. Sure, there are some people who actually have that kind of mindset (ex: incels) but it's obvious that's not what I'm saying. You pulling that out of your anus when something with genders comes up is not going to do you any favors in the future."
unpopularopinion,fql3dlj,t1_fql2gq4,1589444839.0,"Is that what you really got out of what I was saying? The same can be applied to men hitting other men, men hitting women, and vice versa. This is the logic I'm trying to point out to you:

There is a beach. At the beach it says""Don't go swimming in the water. There is a riptide that can suck you under."" If someone were to go into the water you could say it's the water's fault, but that person wasn't following the rules

There is a mama bear with her cubs. It is typically frowned upon to go near them for obvious reasons. If you go near them and get mauled, sure the mom did the mauling and that's her ""fault"".  But you went over there and disturbed them. Even though it is known that was possible something bad could happen.

Last example. An active volcano is on an island and it known to eject lava and ash erratically. Someone goes and climbs the volcano. The volcano erupts, and that person gets seriously hurt. Sure, the volcano damaged the person,  but that person went up the fiery mountain knowing full well it could erupt at any moment. 

Avoiding these situations is not doing so out of fear, it's called respect. You respect the power of nature, you respect animals for what they are, and you also respect people. You don't not hit someone because you're afraid of what they'll do. You don't hit them because it's a sign of respect. Idk how you were able to feed that victim complex with what I was saying."

If you stop the first action the second one won't follow. Although, someone getting shot for calling someone a name is ridiculous  and most likely has other problems going on than the situation at hand. And how would you be able to know how much pain a person is in? Some people take pain well and others simply do not. That's not a very reliable way to see if something someone did is justified. Regardless of what we think it right or wrong, there are people out that will do as they please in certain situations. It would be best not to give them any reason to jack someone up."

What it should be is that you shouldn't lay your hands on someone and then expect not to get hit. Keep your hands to yourself and you'll save yourself from getting rocked.

Also another thing to mention, athletes also have to maintain a rigorous course schedule, maintain a high GPA, and put in a lot of training and work outside of the school work.
