You saved both your asses. I hope someday he comes to his senses and thanks you for what he did, but he's got a lot of growing up to do!

I definitely think he should be punished and taking his gifts could be a good idea, but I think rather than just taking everything permanently and making him resent you,  it might be a good idea to put this stuff on hold. I fear it might make him have more misdirected anger.

Maybe start by putting these things on hold (he gets nothing for now) and having a serious conversation about racism, homophobia and empathy.  (I think you did, but it might be a good idea to meet him where he's at, in a way.)

I would wonder if there's any way to get him to see how awful he would feel if the shoe was on the other foot. Maybe talk to him about where his views are coming from.  Do you think the teacher would be willing to sit and talk with you guys at some point too?

To make where I'm coming from clear,  I'm not a parent, I'm a 22yo who remembers being that age, and although I wasn't racist,  I was a bit of an edgelord.

Perhaps by ""classic PTSD nightmares "" he means, the way everyone assumes PTSD nightmares are supposed to be. Like, the nightmares you have where you're just straight up reliving the trauma over and over again.  I know before I read into PTSD more and starting trying to get some help, I assumed that a lot  of what I was experiencing couldn't be PTSD nightmares because I wasn't just replaying the trauma(s) in my head like a movie.

Although I do experience the reliving nightmares sometimes,  my nightmares are usually just similar to the trauma they're about. For example, there have been times where I've had to try to escape someone I thought was going to hurt or kill me. Since the last time I had to do something like that, many of my nightmares have had a similar theme. It's not always the person chasing me and it rarely takes place anywhere I tried run through. 

Sometimes it's the actual person chasing me through some endless fictional labyrinth.  Other times I'm running from monsters or aliens who want to harm me in a similar way. The nightmares don't always play out the same way,  but the resemblance they bear to my trauma is clear.

But anyway,  that's just my experience.  If anyone else would like to weigh in, that'd be awesome! Also,  if any of you guys have questions about PTSD from the inside,  feel free to ask! Everyone's experience is different,  but I can definitely speak to mine."

wheelchairs,fpx50m7,t1_fpwquht,1588975777.0,"""She ""couldn't,  in good conscience condemn such a young woman to a life bound to a chair? """" This is some ass backwards logic.

So you're so prejudiced against people who need chairs that you'd rather them be confined to their home and/or a bed so you don't have to think about them? (That's what I hear)

My chair is the difference between me being a functional adult who is working on getting a driver's license, with a goal of living independently and working Full-time, and me being bedbound or housebound with no hope for the future. I was well on my way to being the latter at several points in my life. Once as a teenager  because my mom  didn't want to accept my disability and forced me to walk and suffer for years as much as she could get away with because I'm ""lazy"" and ""giving up."" 

Then over the last few years I dealt with something similar but somewhat better because I needed a fitted power chair with tilt and legs, but I had a manual chair with almost no back support, almost no cushion and a footrest that was too high and I couldn't really keep my feet on the footrest. Now I have a power chair with a  foam cushion, a molded back with lateral support and a chest strap, and some nice comfortable footrests that have straps for when I need them. 

 This chair is the most comfortable thing I've ever sat in and I don't feel confined to it AT ALL!! If anything,  being in denial of what my real needs are kept me in confinement, the ableism of others around me is what kept me confined. The second that chair was delivered I went from someone who was able to work PT at best and wasn't sure how long I could keep it up to someone who now sees total independence as an achievable goal.

Are the people around me still ableist and pretty awful to me in general? Hell yes! But at the end of the day, I know what I need to make things work and if something works out in my favor,  I won't have to deal with those particular ableists in my daily life. Thankfully for me, my current doc isn't too ableist.

At best we have someone with a mental disability who doesn't really understand boundaries.  Even if that's the case,  she probably shouldn't be texting a teenager. If it is, I'd recommend seeing if  your parents or another trusted adult can sit down with you guys and discuss boundaries. 

At worst,  we have a predatory person that is using the disability to prey on you. It's not uncommon for a predator with a condition or unfortunate circumstances to use those things to gain sympathy from a victim and guilt them into putting up with things that make them uncomfortable.
