gardening,f19dm0b,t3_d85osa,1569271088.0,Love this. It’s so beautiful and I’m now going to have to get a vase like that
ABoringDystopia,ez62u7r,t1_ez4j6am,1567708526.0,Yo if she needs any advice you can message me. I’ll give it straight up about pros and cons and anything else
bipolar,ez5r0rf,t3_czx677,1567703398.0,I know I have a terrible perspective on society and need to change to become more positive and not let things bother me but this meme is me every day! Even knowing this it’s hard to not have extreme emotions that everything is going to shit
Veterans,ez5nkqt,t3_d01zcz,1567701872.0,Thanks for sharing. This is good advice
bipolar,eyvv26n,t3_cz2cfy,1567512732.0,This is awesome
Veterans,eyphle1,t1_eyofykt,1567300325.0,"The only reason she dropped me was because my husband and I were about to PCs and she signed off EFMp documents. Orders got canceled last minute because they all of a sudden decided I can’t travel with my husband to the assignment. Well we got orders very quickly again in the next week and. A half, and denied again. Had to go through a process where I have special treatment or something like that. So finally there’s orders but I kept telling myself it was no use to try to go back to therapy because it would only be another week for orders (they also can’t put me on medication because they can’t observe how I’m doing for several months) and then now I realize that that mentality was stupid and I should have just kept going to see a therapist until knowing 100 we are pcsing. Now we are leaving this base in 3 days to go see family. I know I can suck it up for a month till we are at the next assignment. I just started getting very emotional today when I made this post and feel kind of crazy"

Veterans,eyofawu,t1_eyocnib,1567276009.0,"Because I’m constantly being told I overreact, like projecting my feelings about one thing onto another. I also feel irrational sometimes and so don’t know how to organize my thoughts to understanding what I’m really upset about."
bipolar,eymn0zh,t3_cxkpiz,1567213854.0,Keep posting please. I love how this community cares about art and I hope you feel inspired with how much love you get for your work

bipolar,exih0e5,t1_exibkh5,1566328143.0,It’s something I hadn’t considered until recently but then I looked it up today and there are a lot of reviews of women who have had the same negative symptoms from the implant. I don’t think doctors consider how bipolar and these implants effect each other. I’m gonna post an update on if my bipolar symptoms are worse on or off the implant once I can get it taken out in case it helps other women.
antiMLM,ew04rvq,t1_evzv5y3,1564975773.0,Do you follow any mil spouse pages already? I’m wondering if they are useful at all for relaying actual helpful information or if it’s a shit show.
TrueOffMyChest,evn53or,t3_ckahiw,1564618877.0,Literally!!! I worked with mostly men and I only respected the ones who didn’t constantly bash on their wives or flirt/cheat. I get that it’s a joke in the military that the wife cheats while the husband is on deployment but somehow I have more sympathy for these wives after I learn how shitty these husbands can be! So blessed I am married to a loving and caring man who communicates with me to work on creating a better relationship.
Veterans,evfsztq,t3_cjly4v,1564500839.0,Thank you all for the responses they were helpful. Now I just need to tell our family friend to stop recommending this site. I looked up vso reps and I will make the call to set up an appointment
Veterans,evea7to,t1_eve9q0c,1564460305.0,"I was recommended to use this by my husbands family friend, but it does seem sketchy and the friend doesn’t know much about it personally. The fee is apparently like $2500. It seems like a scam but I figured this would be the place to ask"
BlackPeopleTwitter,etw5a2v,t1_etvmcer,1563254489.0,I do the same thing. I rarely travel 30 miles from my house so I don’t necessarily need them but you never know if one day the apocalypse might happen and suddenly everything is scarce and I have to trade those bottles of water for my life
TwoXChromosomes,es3qi77,t1_es3n8vg,1561568456.0,That’s amazing you were able to overcome those fears and meet someone who restored confidence that you could raise a child with a partner without the fear of being bipolar or trust issues get in the way. This makes me realize I do have trust issues I need to identify as well about if I were to want to have a child. My husband and I  don’t want kids now and maybe will never want children but he says if I want children in the future he would be okay with it. The fear of being abandoned is a big issue for me or even neglected once having the child that I feel like those would be issues to figure out before a big decision will like that is made.
TwoXChromosomes,es3evkr,t1_es2cy71,1561560934.0,"Thank you for the response. I’ve had an Ob/gyn who would answer my questions regarding pregnancy and the biological urge in the most cliche opinion based answers. I had to ask on reddit if this was biology or psychology because how can we know if there is no proof to back it up. As well as how can you tell a woman she won’t have control over the desire to get pregnant if it isn’t her values and psychology influence that is physically causing urges to have a child. 

I have people telling me to treat my bipolar in holistic ways, though I agree those help me,medication is a requirement for me. And definitely while I have these types of symptoms of mania and depression so severely I wouldn’t bring a baby into my life"
TwoXChromosomes,es3dsvh,t1_es2iok6,1561560214.0,"I need to get on medication to balance my bipolar. I was only recently diagnosed even though I’ve been seeking treatment for anxiety and depression for four years until finally I have a diagnosis that matches my symptoms. If I change my mind and want to have a child after a while of managing medication your personal story really helps. If this isn’t to much, before medication did you have an overwhelming fear of the idea of getting pregnant?"
TwoXChromosomes,es1zq18,t1_es1y09l,1561510089.0,I think more like the ideology that it’s God’s desire to bring life into the world inspires women to want to have children.
TwoXChromosomes,es1kv91,t1_es1jvh6,1561499176.0,"Thank-you! Definitely not an unpopular opinion on r/childfree . And my husband really finds kids annoying, though I can handle being around them in small doses such as working in a kindergarten where I’m getting paid to be there. Definitely not go home and spend all my time, money, and sanity taking care of a kid. Thanks for the advice!"
TwoXChromosomes,es1k29k,t1_es1i8sn,1561498634.0,Awesome point! I believe our brain psychological will cause our body to have physical effects such as how people form different ailments from stress etc. So if we have values of being in a nurturing motherly role than we physically will feel those psychological effects. But also I could be wrong
TwoXChromosomes,es1j0pa,t1_es1axzd,1561497935.0,At least for now I feel like I will never want children and I don’t believe it’s just because of mental health issues. I wouldn’t let anyone try to sway me into having a child but I still get agitated about being told because I’m a woman I’ll want children. I was trying to see if there was any research that biological urges were medically proven but there isn’t really any evidence. That’s why I wanted to see what others thought because it would ease my mind that this type of phenomenon isn’t out of my control or maybe my feelings were wrong and there is an urge that some people fight to ignore. Thank you for responding
AmateurRoomPorn,erzr3sg,t3_c50bv1,1561447142.0,Nice! My husband and I are moving to Anchorage Alaska and we’ve been looking at places and the kitchens are almost always remodeled and so beautiful. This is by far my favorite kitchen design!
