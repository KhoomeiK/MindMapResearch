It constantly works both sides of your brain, trains your memory, can induce shamanic trance-like altered States of consciousness in which you can achieve therapeutic effects, as well as giving you a sense of progression. It gives you something to look forward to again and again, and once you've worked towards learning something new and mastering it, the reward is realising that you created your own happiness, as well as a sense of achievement. It also improves your patience, as you learn that those things you want to do/play, that get you down when you can't immediately play them, simply take time. It's just a matter of persistence."

This is how you ""naturally manufacture"" a sense of self. You know that image of someone whomst you must mimic? You manufacture it, but like I said earlier it is built over time. You cannot just instantly have the pristine image of yourself in an instant, and there and then know who you are, even if it is just a conceptual image. 

To create this ""guide"" or ""template"" to follow, if you will, you must first be that template. And be all the other templates, because to be who you are, you have to know who you are not, and you can only do that by doing the things you want to do, holding no expectation to Bea certain way. 

Also as well as observing thoughts, observe feelings and emotions, try to connect all of your senses to one experience. Rather than viewing your thoughts as desperate** with their own ""characteristics"" and your emotions as something else, and your bodily feelings as something else, they are all part of you... So whether you are real or not, you are experiencing ""this""... Whatever this is.


** Meant to say seperate"
mentalhealth,feddyvq,t3_eohenl,1579008851.0,"It's got nothing to do with circumstances, or rather it currently has EVERYTHING to do with circumstances... But it does't need to. You could have all of your worldly desires, but you'd still feel this way, or occasionally feel similarly. Instead of focussing on what's coming into your brain/awareness, focus on how you ground yourself in this.

Focus on the expression of self, rather than the expression of other. The first you can control, the other you cannot. 

Your ego likes things to be a certain way, it has its comforts and it's fears. Now, you can change who you are as a person, but your ego might still fear those things if you are still only focussing on those ""things"". 

Defocalising allows you to shift that focus to the eye behind the eye. You might kick yourself constantly for being awkward or anxious, but honestly... reality exists within both tension and relief. Anxiety is necessary, but it doesn't have to be viewed in such a negative way. It's usually the fear of fear that is detrimental, than the fear itself.

One way to apply this all in a practical sense, simply observe the relationship between the thoughts of the mind, and your bodily tensions/actions. Notice which thoughts genuinely create tension within the body and relieve them. It might seem difficult at first, you might worry about if your way of thinking will ever change... But that is only because it hasn't changed there and then, in the moment you expect it to. 

I suppose you have to kind of ""forget"" that your expecting something to happen if that makes any sense. Because it's impossible not to expect things, but you can find other things to take you away from the distraction of expectation. Instead of the expectation, anxiety and fear being the focus of your reality, they become smaller things part of a much bigger thing, instead of being the root of your reality.

Often you might think the other things are actually distracting you from the inner criticism, because deep down you want to believe that you are right, that the voice inside is actually some kind of profound judgement. Or rather your ego wants to think it is right, therefore it will manufacture the most bizarre progression of thoughts in order to make ""you"" feel underpowered to your ego, to make you feel both so small and so big at the same time.

I know this will come across as a half-assed solution... But seriously don't underestimate the breath. Also don't overlook tension in your body, you can relieve it. And once it's relieved you might find that tensions in your mind follow."
mentalhealth,fedbwfp,t1_fedaxxp,1579007029.0,"All I can say is you might be relying too much on exterior things like people or places for your happiness. Attachment or entanglement can lead in some cases to a complete dependence on others. I'd say something that helps is observing how you think when you are alone, and how you think around others. Notice if your thoughts are oriented more so around glorification or progression. 

But also, you cannot ""know yourself"". It's a paradox. You can manufacture an image and idea of whom you think you are, but there is no standard ""you"" which will fit your ""identity"" hole perfectly from the begining. Identity isn't a fixed thing, it's meant to change.

I'd say whilst you are feeling this way, don't try and escape from it. More so just observe this feeling of not knowing your identity, because that is you, in that moment. Literally, you can't see your identity because your the identity; you cannot see your eye."
