GriefSupport,fnip087,t3_g1rhmn,1586983818.0,"i am going to be honest with you, i lost my mom when i was 13 i am currently 15, i was very numb to all feelings and whatever anyone told me “everything will be okay” “things will get better” blah blah blah. like i said i am going to be honest, things will be hard and will possibly feel like the world is closing around you and you are just watching everything fall apart. eventually you will be better but it is a process. there is hope and coping comes differently with everyone. it’s been almost two years and i’m still keeping her spirt alive and not a day goes by that i don’t miss her. just know she would want you to keep pushing. she wants to see you too just not so soon, i’m always available to talk and i mean that. i’m here dude :,)"
