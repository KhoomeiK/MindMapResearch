I was supposed to start this summer but they pushed it off to the fall, and do not require to  make up those hours. In the fall they say field work will resume, but, if it doesn‚Äôt, they will replace field with some online training of sorts. They say because of the need for social workers they will try to accommodate people with any concerns.  I hope in two years when I graduate there will be no issues with in-person work to get hours towards LCSW. So I don‚Äôt see a reason for you to worry or wait any longer."
