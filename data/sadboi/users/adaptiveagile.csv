Most psychiatrists are focused on pharmacology, and therefore meet with each patient for no more than 15 minutes after the first session. There’s no way a doctor can get to know you in 15-minute intervals every few months.  Also, I could be wrong, but I don’t believe that meds are prescribed for cluster B personality disorders.

Probably more in the realm of psychology... so maybe go to a psychologist, and see where it goes from there.

bipolar2,fmo3iim,t1_fmnxeqg,1586244049.0,"I wrote a long response to this in order to help, but as luck would have it, the page somehow refreshed and everything is gone. So... I’ll just address the ADHD aspect (I was lucky enough to save the content below):

Here’s a simple test, from a BD2 and ADHD person: Mood disorders like BD generally present themselves in the teens or early 20s, with exceptions. Long before your depression, if you had trouble in school and an inability to concentrate or pay attention at an early age, it would seem to be ADHD. Some other signs include cutting into another person’s conversations, impatience, and always fidgeting. Spacing out when someone talks to you, and later realizing that you didn’t hear a thing the person said. Forgetfulness, poor awareness of time  jumping from one activity to another without finishing either, etc.

If none of this describes you, then I think it’s pretty unlikely that you have ADHD. So back to your bad experience with SSRIs. As you already know, these meds can trigger drug-induced mania, which could be confused with actual hypo/mania from bipolar disorder.

If you’re interested in exploring other aspects of BD, read up on ”mixed states,” or “mixed episodes.” With some people, this 3rd state is far more common than hypomania.

It can involve restlessness, anxiety, racing thoughts, sharp emotional valleys, severe depression, etc.

Hope this helps in some way."

bipolar2,fmngsoh,t1_fmn2ga7,1586225720.0,"Agree 100%. I will never again willingly go off of meds. Disastrous consequences. Addressing your last sentence, I don’t think that’s the only reason people question it. In some cases, it really does just feel like depression—but the SSRIs aren;t cutting it.. Once a person is attuned to the subtleties of hypomania, then things might start to make sense. But yeah, nobody *wants* any disorders.  BD sucks."
bipolar2,fmnfngn,t1_fmmxsm3,1586224977.0,"There’s no reason to worry when you think about it. Doctors often administer the same treatments regardless, so even if you were misdiagnosed, the doctor is treating your specific symptoms. Depressed? SSRI. Still depressed? He adds a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. Agitated? Maybe he’ll get you off the SSRI and use stabilizer monotherapy.

I think a large number of BD II patients are misdiagnosed with unipolar depression. BD II is often very subtle and difficult to diagnose until there’s an “aha” moment your doctor catches. FWIW, depression is the mood you’ll be fighting most of the time anyway.

Don’t forget, MDD isn’t the only kind of clinical depression. There are others. So a person might have overlapping symptoms."
bipolar2,fmneoj8,t3_fw83j3,1586224353.0,"I think it’s very common. Especially if a person was labeled ”MDD”—or unipolar depression for a long time. Most people don‘t match up 100% with each and every symptom and behavior outlined in the DSM. Bottom line, it’s sort of a moot issue because the treatments are similar across the board. 

A person thought to have “treatment resistant“ major depression might be prescribed stabilizers or neuroleptics. If a patient shows signs of mania after being prescribed an SSRI, the doc needs to determine if it was medication-induced hypo/mania, or the new diagnosis of bipolar 1/2. Some bipolar disorder (BD) patients can’t ever use SSRIs, and yet others can, when balanced with other meds.

So when you think about it, what does it matter what it‘s called? I went through the same thought process as you—it’s natural. Eventually, I sort of left the labels behind. Do the meds help? In my case, yes. No name necessary. All that matters is that your health is managed effectively, and that you feel good.

But... there are significant differences between type 1 and 2. I think that type 1 will generally be more patently obvious to the patient and doctor. Type 2 is particularly tricky for many reasons (which would take a small book to explain). Essentially lots of overlap with other stuff. To make matters more complex, type 2s tend to remain in the depressive state a majority of the time. As the person grows older, the hypomania might not even present itself anymore. Instead it could be mixed episodes."

Personally can’t stand squids bouncing off the limiter in town. It’s the motorcycle equivalent of a guy carrying a boom box, or a guy blasting his favorite music from his car. “Thanks for sharing.” It’s obnoxious. 

However, I like a good exhaust note. I rode my last two bikes bone stock, and my current bike was purchased used, with a full system. I lug it when in the city or when splitting, but once set loose in the canyons, I ride it like a sportbike.

Been riding a pretty long time, and have found that loud pipes are absolutely effective at getting the attention of drivers, pedestrians and cyclists. In fact, it’s such an obvious point that I’m baffled by the controversy. If someone hears you, they’ll look. Would you step out into the street when you clearly hear a Ferrari Italia dopplering closer? What about a Tesla... or a bicycle?

Back in the 90s I was filtering through traffic on my bone stock sportbike. A little kid ran across the street out of nowhere—my lateral view was blocked by the cars on both side. He popped in front of me from behind a van to my right, and I swerved and dropped the bike. Thank God I didn’t hit him. I was living abroad and never even heard of the “loud pipes saves lives” thing. But the next thing I did was to pick up a slip on. Never had the same type of trouble again. 

In fact, I came very close to being road kill when a bus took an illegal left in front of us on a long, high speed road. He must have heard us coming and slammed on his brakes. I’m thinking we were closing in on 100 or so meters when he came to a stop, only blocking my lane. Happened so fast that it was hard to make sense of it until we passed, wondering how we were still alive.

If I’m riding down a street, pedestrians hear the bike and take note before crossing. I even have examples on video—my looping helmet cam. I installed a car horn in my bike, so that’s the primary defense. But drivers generally hear my bike coming. It’s not obnoxiously loud at all—especially when short-shifting around 3.5k revs.

Of course... a rider with an ear-splitting system can ride like an idiot and piss off every driver on the road. As with any exotic or muscle car."
