Stoicism,fr48l5d,t3_gmdrk5,1589879693.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss. I can only imagine how hard it must be for you right now if your family didn’t know he was your boyfriend, but I hope the words of all these kind people will help you to feel less alone in your grief.

I lost one of my best friends in a car collision when I was at university in 2012 many hundreds of miles away from my family and close friends. I remember how isolated I felt in my grief, how overwhelming my emotions were when they’d spike and consume me. I live in the UK and she’d gone to university in New Zealand, so her funeral was held there too and I couldn’t attend. There is still a hole in my heart after 8 years and I’ve come to realise it will always be there, but that’s okay. I was incredibly lucky to have known her and to have had my life enriched by her company and to have the wonderful memories I carry with me. She lives on in my mind. Very occasionally, I’ll see her in my dreams - I like to think she’s paying me a visit.

Grief is powerful and should be respected. It’s as natural for humans as breathing. All I can say is that what helped me get through the worst months was allowing my pain to exist, acknowledging it, welcoming it, not fearing the pain but understanding that my body must release the trauma in the ways it knows how in order to protect me in the long run. Trust your body - it will do everything it can to heal but you must let it dictate the pace and trying to resist by willing the healing to come faster will likely set you back further.

I hope you find peace. My thoughts are with you."
aspergirls,fr46sq9,t3_gmittx,1589877825.0,"Honestly, it sounds like your friend has some negative internal bias against people with autism. We can’t know the root of that - it could be something she picked up from her parents or a sibling, it could be that she’s very misinformed and ignorant on the subject, etc. She may also be unconsciously and illogically worrying that your friendship will somehow change because of this diagnosis, even if in reality it doesn’t. 

If you are able to talk to her, perhaps you can raise with her that you picked up on the fact she was experiencing some discomfort during your conversation and you’re wondering where it’s coming from. Don’t go in with an answer already in your mind, let her show you who she is as it might not be anything we’ve thought of here. Essentially, treat her with the kindness you wish she’d shown you when you’re calling her up on her dismissiveness, and she may need some reassurance that you’re still the same person on a fundamental level. If she continues to behave rudely, calmly say that her behaviour is hurtful and juvenile, tell her when she’s ready to approach your friendship with more maturity she can get in contact (if that’s what you’d like too) and _don’t text her_ because a gap of silence will help her to understand how badly she’s hurt you.

I’m afraid you also need to mentally prepare yourself for losing this friend if she continues to be unsupportive and rude. You don’t deserve to be invalidated by someone who’s supposed to care about you.

I hope you work it out. Best of luck.

Edit: My mum does everything you’ve described that your friend did, hence I’ve got some practice at having to deal with an unsupportive loved one 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️"
Stoicism,fqwpoao,t1_fqwcyc8,1589713289.0,"I was scrolling to see if anyone had linked Esther Perel’s amazing talks on the subject of love and infidelity - I’m so glad to see they’re already here. I could not recommend these more.

Also Esther’s book, [The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1473673550/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_bErWEbZH3391V) has a chapter on why people in long-term, happy, loving relationships can cheat on their partner, which I personally found to be very insightful. It’s not always because the cheater is a villain or insecure, and it’s not always because the person who’s been cheated on is somehow lacking (ie. not pretty/handsome/outgoing enough etc) - sometimes the act of cheating is about the cheater accessing a different version of themselves that can only come out in the context of another sexual partner. However, this obviously does not excuse the disrespectful nature of the act nor the pain generated in their partner if the relationship agreement includes not sleeping with others as a hard boundary. 

OP, I hope you gain something from these resources in your time of turmoil and find peace eventually."

Stepmom,fqwnedm,t3_gl98in,1589710917.0,"I’m sorry to hear you’re in such turmoil, it really comes through in your words.

I’m 29F and I thought I didn’t want kids until last year I met the man of my dreams. He’s kind and patient and playful - we fit together so well and my mind did a complete U-turn on me. I started thinking, “maybe I do want kids if those children would be from him and me...” I was really shocked by it and I’m still trying to figure out what I want now, but my body broods every now and then and this has only started because I’ve met someone I’m truly compatible with. So maybe that annoying advice of “you just haven’t met the right person” has some truth to it after all.

Honestly, if this is keeping you up at night, you need to talk to your SO about your change in heart and mind. The alternative of saying nothing sounds like it would be unbearable for you to live with long term. Fast forward to you at age 65 - do you think you’ll regret not having had your own bio-kid? I appreciate the prospect of having this conversation with your SO must be very anxiety inducing if he has already said he doesn’t want more children, but if your mind has changed then maybe his will too and in the grand scheme of things I’d say it’s worth finding out if that could happen. It might not be immediately - definitely don’t go into that conversation with expectations that he’ll immediately change his mind. It could be weeks or months before he comes around to it with many repeated conversations or even arguments between you during that time. It might be worth giving yourself a limit - ie if he isn’t showing signs of changing his mind after 6-12 months of you repeatedly (obviously/subtlety) saying you want a child, then you will have to accept that you either leave him to find someone who wants children or stay knowing your dream won’t come true.

I hope you work this out between you. Best of luck."

aspergirls,fqaurao,t3_gfgq98,1589225628.0,"Ohhh yessss The Sims Makin’ Magic was my absolute jam when I was a kid! I still find myself, age 29, humming some of the old Sims 1 tunes every now and then (eg from the Pet Store or the Gardening Centre). I was a self-sufficient badass with growing my own veg, making honey, churning butter, making wine, baking bread and cakes... Those were the days haha

I’ve played all 4 generations of The Sims and I’ve enjoyed every one in their own right, but they’re actually quite different games overall. 

I don’t think I learned social skills from playing. I could play for hours on end because it was a safe, customisable world that I could get lost in without any anxiety around real-world social interaction. If anything, some anxiety came from knowing my parents would tell me off for playing for so many hours at a time and I’d have to return to the real world!"

aspergirls,fqat2zc,t3_gfxupl,1589224805.0,"If I’m fortunate enough to be in a direct conversation with the person who has set the task, then I’ll listen to their instructions and at the end I’ll say, “Just to make sure I’ve understood, the task is...” and I’ll play back what **I think** the task is. This gives the other person an opportunity to either say, “Yes!” or “No, that’s not quite right...” and they can explain again and I can ask more questions because we’ve moved into a clarification stage of the conversation. I’ve done this face-to-face, over the phone and over instant messenger. It’s less easy to do via text and email but I find bullet points really help when I’m playing back my own understanding in my reply and even though it’s slower it still gives the person a chance to clarify further (and in the meantime I’ll get on with what I think is right until they tell me otherwise - it’s not my fault if I do it a bit wrong because their instructions were too vague in the first place).

I actually have found when I take this approach people react much less negatively to me asking follow up questions. I think it’s because they can see I’m taking it seriously and really trying to get clear in my mind on their expectations.

I know it takes courage, I had to dig deep to open myself up to potential criticism and my anxious brain says it’s *definitely* coming, but the reality is not so. You can do it! Best of luck :)"

I agree with the other commenter that he doesn’t sound like he wants another child. If this is an important milestone for *your* life, then you need to seriously consider if this man is right for you knowing there’s a real risk he might not ever change his mind.

If this is the first time you’ve brought up the topic of having a baby together, then his reaction could’ve been due to him getting caught off guard and unsure about how to answer (that doesn’t excuse the rudeness, you can say you don’t know without being a dick). So you could attempt to bring it up again at a calm moment for a sensible discussion about each of your expectations for this relationship. I’d be willing to bet he hasn’t given one thought to whether you’ll have children together because he already has three so he’s probably assumed that’s it now. If you’ve brought the topic of babies up before and this reaction happened then too, run for the hills.

My special interests rotate too - as a kid/teen they were more cultural, like my obsession with the band Fall Out Boy and particularly the lead singer Patrick Stump, but as I’ve gotten older I find my obsessions are more interest/hobby based, such as all things relating to making sourdough bread.

Your cravings could be coming from any number of places - from your body’s genuine need for specific nutrients (eg. protein, iron, magnesium), to reaching for familiar foods as a means of emotional comforting if that’s something you’ve previously engaged in.

Try to pay attention to what is happening inside you on an emotional level when these cravings arise. If there’s no distress, maybe it’s arisen because your body actually needs something specific."

intuitiveeating,fncxggz,t3_g0w960,1586850618.0,"Well you’re not alone - I’ve definitely had the same experience of not feeling satisfied after eating if what I ate didn’t align to what my body was “asking” me for, even though my fullness cue says I’m not hungry anymore.

This is purely based on my own experience, but if I go to my fridge and my body says, “bacon please” but I don’t have bacon, then I’ll take that to mean my body is asking for protein. If it says, “salad won’t cut it”, then I’ll take that to mean my body needs something richer in energy like fats (eg cheese, peanut butter), and other days a nice salad with veggies and olive oil is exactly the right fit. Essentially, I try to listen to the nutrients my body might be asking for over the actual food. Most of the time this works for me enough that I’m not mentally irked afterwards by the lack of whatever tasty thing my body originally wanted. I can get on with my day no problems. 

I’ve also found that if my body says, “bacon please” and I try to fill the void with non-protein based foods, let’s say bread (or any carbs), then afterwards my body will be like, “you can’t fool me, that isn’t what I asked for”, and I’ll feel full but dissatisfied, which isn’t pleasant.

GetOutOfBed,fn9as05,t3_fztac5,1586765676.0,"Yes, I think my dehydration in the morning may be part of the reason I struggle with grogginess and exhaustion upon waking. When I wake up, I always sit on the edge of my bed and reach for my water, I take a few long sips and swill it around my mouth to get rid of the dryness and it does help to take the edge off my exhaustion. It definitely doesn’t fully eliminate the grogginess but it’s just enough to help me actually get out of bed, rather than succumbing to the loud, insistent voice in my mind that says, “Go back to sleep...”

Edit: I also think the actual action and brain power required to drink water also helps something in my brain/body to recognise that the time for sleeping has finished."

bisexualadults,fmrwzwr,t3_fwx10l,1586338577.0,"Hey, bi woman here. I met my guy on Tinder and we’ve been together for 10 months. I was upfront about my orientation from the outset (to avoid time wasters or people I’m not compatible with) and when I told him he asked me what I thought about guys who engaged in same sex play. My spidey senses tingled immediately and as we talked it became clear he enjoyed it too, though didn’t pursue romantic relationships with men.

Personally, I was actively looking for someone with enough flexibility in their orientation to understand my experience of the world and respect it. I’ve dated straight men in the past and realised it wasn’t an optimal fit for me (though I have no doubt there are lovely straight men out there who aren’t threatened by my bisexuality and I wasn’t writing straight men off in my search). 

Honestly, it may be a long road, but the best thing you can do for yourself is to _be yourself_ when you’re searching. The right girl(s) will either already be into it or be curious enough to find out more. Confidence is very sexy. At least on apps and dating sites you can just hit the block button for anyone who turns out to be closed minded or rude.

One of the other commenters suggested these comments from your Mum could be emotional abuse - it is. The problem is that I imagine, when pressed, she would feel entirely justified in making the comments and be operating from a self-righteous position of “I’m trying to help.” 

If there are other people in your network that you trust who can talk to her alone and get her to understand that her comments are damaging and unhelpful then definitely leverage these trusted people. If not, please know that her reaction and comments reflect on who *she* is as a person and actually have nothing to do with you. Your mum is a product of her own upbringing and has her own demons to battle. Unfortunately, she’s been brought up to believe that emotionally abusing others in the name of “health” is acceptable, without actually understanding one bit about what healthy looks like. This is rife in society as I’m sure you know - everyone has an opinion.

It’s difficult at first but perhaps next time she does this behaviour try to distance yourself from the words/emotions she’s pushing towards you and just watch her with curiosity - where is this coming from? Why does she feel such a need to say what she’s saying? Why is she telling your business to everyone and what does she gain by doing so? Is she trying to shame you into conforming to her standards of behaviour? What kind of person employs shame as a tactic against the people they’re supposed to love? Does she feel out of control? Is she scared for your wellbeing? Is she worried about her image and being seen as a “bad mother” by other people, as if your ED is all about her?

I understand this is going to bring up some very painful emotions/memories for you if you start to analyse your true reality, but doing so may give you more clarity and a calmer mind.

Best of luck to you. Be kind to yourself as best you can."

intuitiveeating,flg5290,t3_fohnzr,1585130952.0,"Wow, I feel you. You basically described my relationship with my own mother down to a T. I’ve tried on a number of occasions to explain what IE is and why I’m doing it, even leaning on other resources, but she categorically does not want to know and said as much. It’s a source of sadness to me that she’s so uninterested because I can’t share my journey with her without being severely judged - she’s very blunt and so has said things like “you need to lose a lot of weight” or “you’re severely overweight” and gets upset with me for “giving up” despite knowing from our previous conversations that I’m trying to repair my relationship with food and prioritise my mental health. 

My mum is a chronic dieter - she’s probably been on diets since her teens and I don’t think she’s ever _not_ been on a diet. But what I try to remember is there’s a significant generation difference between us - my mum grew up in and has lived through a time where women were taught their looks are their most valuable asset. I was raised to believe this too but alongside the notion that my intellect, skills and drive are also my biggest assets. I’ve had a choice to reject the idea of my appearance being the only thing I have going for me. I don’t think my mum has ever had that choice in her mind.

My mum’s emotional reaction is more of a reflection on her than me. I was also showing her IE to indirectly say “there’s another way” as I knew she wouldn’t have heard of it but may want to take steps to free herself from diet culture too. I think it’s probably too scary for her to contemplate that there’s another way to eat because she’s devoted _her whole life_ to diets and diet culture. She’s brainwashed. If she’s given it any thought, it must be horrible to think that she’s spent 50+ years putting herself through hell to achieve this singular goal when she didn’t have to, though I think it’s more likely she just thinks IE is nonsense, and in a way I wonder if there’s an element of “I suffered so you should too” when she talks to me about my choices.

Personally, I’ve had to let go of the idea that my mum will ever support me in trying to improve my mental health and my relationship with food. I’ve been banging my head against a brick wall and expending valuable emotional energy on someone who doesn’t want to engage so for my own health I’ve stopped trying, which has shrunk our relationship because this topic is now off the table, but in the long-term is beneficial for me.

I’m sorry you’re also experiencing this tension because I know how stressful and hurtful it can be to have someone you love reject you. Well done for staying the IE course nevertheless and I hope as your mum sees positive changes in you and your wellbeing that she’ll start to open her eyes. Best of luck to you.

I have been trying to shift my own mental state into one where I respect my body’s needs, which includes honouring my hunger when it arises. It might just be a little something to keep me going until my next meal time and sometimes I find naturally I’ll need to eat less as a result during the meal itself, but that’s okay. The point is my body feels satiated. 

Honour your hunger OP. Find snacks that work for you if none of your previous go-to snacks are appealing anymore. I don’t know what they were but it may be that your body is shifting towards craving something more satisfying. Try to always have at least 2 out of the 3 - protein, fat, carbs - in your snacks. Eg cheese and crackers, or salami followed by an apple, etc.

Best of luck!

Edit: Bananas are amazing, any nut butter or a handful of nuts is very satisfying, I’m a sucker for gherkins so those are a good snack for me. Rice cakes are the actual worst just fyi, try to stay away from foods that are 99% air and have very little nutrition because your body won’t be fooled and you’ll still be hungry."

It’s based entirely on paying attention to what your body _needs_ and moving away from unhealthy behaviours instilled by diet culture and tactless comments from others.

Best of luck to you, I hope your inner peace continues 👏🏻"
EatingIntuitively,fktqs96,t3_fkgwl6,1584531487.0,"I’ve actually combated some of my background anxiety about this topic by starting to learn how to make my own sourdough bread. There are some great videos on YouTube with easy-to-follow instructions. I figured that if the shops really do struggle to get stock, or even close, then at least I will still be able to feed myself and my family provided I have flour. Plus, putting my mind to something constructive helps to calm my anxiety and makes me feel empowered rather than helpless."
FootFetishTalks,fktq8s2,t3_fki370,1584530924.0,"This is awesome, I’m so happy for you 👏🏻 Thanks for sharing your story and words of wisdom."
intuitiveeating,fktq3li,t1_fksfzyy,1584530769.0,This is great progress 👏🏻 You must be pleased to have made that observation. It still feels odd for me that I’m tuning into my body and listening to these physical sensations but it’s been so unbelievably worth it imo. Best of luck on your IE journey!

intuitiveeating,fkqftrw,t3_fjs4uz,1584444274.0,"I feel you! 

I found this amazing [video on how to make sourdough bread](https://youtu.be/2FVfJTGpXnU) yesterday and have legit started my our sourdough culture because I felt that having this heritage skill would be beneficial for me and my family. And it’s fun 😋 

With no social engagements I have time on my hands and with the potential for food to become rationed or even difficult/risky to procure it may be beneficial in the long run. And if not, I’ll still know how to make my own bread 👍🏻 Win-win.

Maybe try learning how to make something that you’re interested in - it doesn’t have to be bread but anything you’ve wondered about once and never tried before. Crafts, baking, macrame, coding... Constructive activities will help to see us through this pandemic."

This new fella sounds lovely. I hope it all works out in the ways you want 🤞🏻
unpopularopinion,fkl3ou9,t3_fj0esh,1584297802.0,"I’ve upvoted this but it’s and idyllic viewpoint imho. In my experience, the majority of the time when someone corrects me and I’ve followed up to admit I got something wrong, that person then uses my admission to suggest I am somehow disingenuous or weak. These people are trolls and bullies, basically, but I’ve definitely found it means I’m wary of responding to people who correct things. It’s a shame because I love a good debate with intelligent and open-minded individuals that helps me to expand my horizons."

However, your communication methods are sincerely lacking and actually lead to poor quality discussions on this sub imo. Everyone you write to is judged as guilty and treated with condescension before you’ve actually given them a chance to learn. I can only assume you yourself have been treated this way in real life and I’m very sorry about that if it’s the case because nobody should receive such treatment. 

I hope in time as you grow up this bubbling anger within you will subside and you find peace in yourself and life."

I did not make an assumption that men shouldn’t have the right to express their sexuality - I was arguing for it. But your tactic is quite often to try and put words in the mouths of commenters so I should’ve seen it coming tbf."

Egalitarianism,fkflu1k,t3_fgo6ar,1584137277.0,"The video is a bit fucked up yeah, I think they’re trying to demonstrate how to _force_ men to grow empathy for something that they might see and say “it’s not my problem”. It’s certainly got us talking about it!

It’s funny how this thread has basically turned into the [Monty Python Four Yorkshiremen sketch](https://youtu.be/26ZDB9h7BLY) though with the number of people trying to suggest that the issue of limited/no access to sanitary products when a woman is **_literally bleeding heavily out of her vagina_** is apparently invalid because “men have problems too”.

Just imagine a woman whose period has arrived early and without warning, that blood literally running down her legs and staining the chair she’s sitting on in your office. She runs to the bathroom in a panic only to find the machine that dispenses tampons charges money and she doesn’t have any change with her. There’s a stain on the back of her skirt too, so now not only does she have to stuff a huge wad of toilet paper down her knickers and _pray_ it doesn’t leak within 30 minutes whilst she tries to find another source of sanitary products, but she’s also worrying about anybody seeing her soiled clothes. And whilst she’s trying to solve this biological problem, she can’t work so her boss is looking at her empty desk for the next half hour and wondering where the fuck she is. This issue is now impacting the business she’s employed by. When she gets back, her boss makes it clear her absence was unacceptable, but she doesn’t feel she can say “I’m sorry but my period arrived early and I had to clean myself up” because there’s so much stigma around the subject that she’s terrified of ridicule or being regarded with disgust by her professional colleagues. Imagine you own the business - you’ve just lost 30-60 minutes of productivity from this woman and all because of inadequate provisioning of sanitary products. Now imagine you’re the Head Master of a school - how many girls per day are missing valuable lesson time because of the same issue and having their learning impacted as a result?

_Of course_ the same issue could be argued for the impact of not stocking toilets with toilet paper - putting people in a scenario where they’ve just taken a dump and have nothing to wipe with is going to majorly affect a person’s ability to be a productive employee! **That’s the whole point - access to sanitary products should be as basic as access to toilet paper.**"
Egalitarianism,fkfgsed,t1_fke7xpw,1584134064.0,"Yeah in ignorant circles that phrase would immediately be taken in a negative light, which is a huge injustice. Even if someone actually is an incel why does that mean they shouldn’t be allowed to seek pleasure? Obviously not through rape (or similar) but there are non-violent means of obtaining it, which is why sex workers are so unbelievably essential to society imho. No law-abiding person should have to live an entirely pleasure-less life and it’s inhumane for some people to suggest they should."

Egalitarianism,fkfff1f,t1_fketuyd,1584133198.0,"Feminism is a difficult and relatively arbitrary label nowadays because there have been so many “waves”, each concerned with a different agenda to the point people get confused, not helped by the media focusing heavily on extremists with misandrist views that don’t represent the masses. I know plenty of people who consider themselves feminists and who fully believe that men’s issues need to be heard and that the only way to make progress is with everyone working together. The feminism I know amongst my friends is essentially egalitarianism.

However, I do completely take your point that there _are_ “feminists” out there who would suggest male pleasure isn’t as important as female pleasure. All I can say is those people are not true feminists. They’re misandrists. The two don’t automatically go together."
Stepmom,fke4gx5,t3_fhyh5y,1584104930.0,"This might be a bit harsh, obviously only you can properly judge the situation, but it sounds like your boyfriend never grew up himself and was probably allowed to run the show when he was a child (or not and now allows his own son _too much_ freedom to “balance” something within himself).

Everyone benefits most of all when the adults in a romantic relationship prioritise the relationship, including the children

I think you need to speak privately with your boyfriend and assert that you won’t be treated as anything less than a figure of authority. If he won’t entertain it, get yourself out of there.

Best of luck."
