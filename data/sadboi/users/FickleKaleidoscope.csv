raisedbynarcissists,fabvc6m,t3_e7utfd,1575929411.0,"Really enjoying everyoneâ€™s replies, makes me feel less alone. The plus side is Iâ€™ve now almost learn to not reflex cry when I break or drop things. And Iâ€™ve explained to my flatmates that itâ€™s a reflex to avoid being yelled at and they are super nice and understanding about it... and if they see me drop/break something they make sure to reassure me and often help clean it up - itâ€™s so refreshing"
raisedbynarcissists,f452vsd,t3_djfbup,1571364734.0,Honestly it was only the local elections not the national ones and I donâ€™t live in the US so these elections are closer to what your guys town elections are like size wise. Honestly donâ€™t have the balls to report her - and sheâ€™d be able to work out that it was me
GetMotivatedBuddies,eyjrun8,t1_eyfygos,1567126566.0,Pmâ€™ed you
GetMotivatedBuddies,eyexybk,t1_eyep2za,1567040602.0,Do you have other suggestions?
GetMotivatedBuddies,eydrkb4,t1_eybnvhz,1567023716.0,Could do whatsapp?
GetMotivatedBuddies,eybmvac,t3_cw1xng,1566988011.0,Keen! Iâ€™m in NZ. I donâ€™t know how this works though I was just searching through reddit to try find somewhere that I could pair up with someone who would keep me motivated on my health and fitness goals and hold me somewhat accountable. Oh and Iâ€™m 22F
EDAnonymous,ewab1o1,t3_cnfpl0,1565239992.0,I feel this! Let me know when you manage to find a way to beat your ED self. Iâ€™m going to try focusing on why I so badly want to get out of this relapse.... which is that Iâ€™m going overseas for 3 months at the end of the year and want to be able to enjoy myself
EDAnonymous,evxxsaf,t3_clupzj,1564913319.0,Now hereâ€™s a question Iâ€™ve always wanted to know the answer to!
EatingDisorders,evwh2o2,t3_ckm5n6,1564863915.0,"That endocrinologist is stupid. I notice this in doctors and physiotherapists that they forget that ED recovery exists and thereâ€™s a good reason for som people to not exercise and not focus on losing weight. 

As for your friend with diabetes or pre-diabetes. One of the best lifestyle things that helps is actually exercise rather than weight loss. If I were her I wouldnâ€™t try to diet at all and just try to get 150mins of exercise a week minimum (and help her work out a safe max - thereâ€™s no real benefit to going overboard esp with a hx of ED). And by exercise that literally can include walking as long as itâ€™s not a super slow stroll. Itâ€™s really hard though to balance ED hx with weight related medical things. Ps I have assumed youâ€™re talking type 2 diabetes"
EDAnonymous,ev4or04,t3_ciae3r,1564218276.0,"Thatâ€™s a really shitty response from your mum so Iâ€™m sorry about that. Her comments donâ€™t mean that you donâ€™t have an eating disorder. Also going to your doctor and talking about it is a great idea. I also feel like you should put your health above sports etc

Good luck"
EDAnonymous,eud74az,t3_cfw2e8,1563705127.0,"Medical professionals would take you seriously and if they donâ€™t go try someone else. EDâ€™s donâ€™t only exist in the context of an underweight BMI... you certainly sound like you have one based on your post. Try to find something enjoyable in your life and remember that people do care about you even if you donâ€™t know it 

*hugs*"
EatingDisorders,ethywy8,t3_cberu6,1562831946.0,I mean hell those tests arenâ€™t always the best.... Iâ€™m â€˜at riskâ€™ but defo have one... plus once I took the test (whilst trying hard to recover) and it came up with defo didnâ€™t have one. I feel that if you think you should do one of those surveys you should probably go talk to your GP anyways
EDAnonymous,ethsnm9,t3_cbgjq0,1562826185.0,This is so accurate! Ironically when feeling good about recovery I asked my flatmate to hide the scale and not tell me where it is.... now I alternate between regretting that and being super pleased ðŸ˜€
EDAnonymous,ethmidz,t3_cbgjq0,1562820022.0,This is so accurate! Ironically when feeling good about recovery I asked my flatmate to hide the scale and not tell me where it is.... now I alternate between regretting that and being super pleased ðŸ˜€
EatingDisorders,esg3tw3,t3_c7karh,1561942416.0,"Sorry to hear of your struggle. Iâ€™m in a somewhat similar position and I find that going out to eat with people can help - that way Iâ€™m not alone, someone to hold me accountable and I donâ€™t have to portion the meal (and I can use the other persons judgement as to if the portion was massive in which case I donâ€™t have to finish the entire thing - and most of the time Iâ€™m wrong and they think itâ€™s a normal amount of food). Dunno if this will help you or not but you could always give it a go"
EatingDisorders,eqfxlm2,t1_eqe8a3n,1560028485.0,Iâ€™m not in America so donâ€™t think I can access any of those. I have a psychologist that I see but I only managed to bring this up the last time I saw him and Iâ€™m not sure how much he knows about eating disorders etc.... plus I only see him sorta monthly ish
EatingDisorders,eqd1oda,t1_eq7nbes,1559982178.0,Hey Iâ€™m OP. I canâ€™t talk to mum about it sadly - itâ€™s just not an option. Iâ€™m usually not at home.... usually a 7 hour drive away at uni but just happen  to be here for a few weeks
EatingDisorders,eqd1jwc,t1_eq7lcz6,1559982111.0,This is actually a great idea.... I might buy Nutella for days that Iâ€™ve not eaten enough and know that I canâ€™t just eat in front of mum
EatingDisorders,eqd1hng,t1_eq7uzur,1559982077.0,Hi Iâ€™m the OP. Thanks for your support. Itâ€™s such a catch 22 because mum doesnâ€™t know my history and I never got to an unhealthy weight even at my worst which means sheâ€™s super encouraging about me losing weight and thinks eating less is the only way to do it... but I canâ€™t tell her or she would never believe me and if she did she might blame herself which I donâ€™t want
EatingDisorders,ep4g9qy,t3_bts0ve,1559039570.0,I agree for most that itâ€™s more that their ED morphs into orthorexia - with one specific exception Iâ€™ve found. Sheâ€™s mostly on YouTube but also Instagram. Her name is Natacha OcÃ©ane and sheâ€™s amazing and quite open about recovering from her eating disorder and how she eats now etc
