But I have other things going on as well, so for all I know, my worsening symptoms may be unrelated to the abilify. I was only on 3mg of that."
BrainFog,fodwdiy,t3_g6vpyn,1587691387.0,"I was recently on a low dose of abilify for maybe 3 months. Stopped it due to similar symptoms of which you described, including brain fog. I have been off it for 1.5 months and the fog and fatigue are absolutely debilitating. I came off lexapro at the same time so not sure what is to blame."

Congrats on the weight loss with keto. Glad to hear it's helped you feel better. I know a lot of my symptoms could probably be helped by cutting out sugar, but it's tough to face when you have food addiction/binge-eating disorder. Ugh.

I keep going back and forth between functional medicine and traditional, and what I ""believe"" in. I do think there's a place for both. (For instance, years ago I pursued a naturopath and was diagnosed with something called ""pyrrole disorder""... not sure if it's legitimate. I'm terrible at following through though so didn't finish the supplements.)

antidepressants,fddj2zw,t3_dmgced,1578314291.0,"I started 3mg a few weeks ago for TRD. Also on lexapro, lithium, depakote. Pros so far are less intrusive thoughts of wanting to be dead and maybe a teensy bit more energy. Cons are insomnia and restlessness at night, and a small increase in dullness maybe.
