I'm fully aware of how my suicide will hurt my family, but I will rather be dead than continue to exist in this miserable world and live my miserable life.

And I honestly couldn't care less about what happens after I die, since I'll be dead and gone.

I already fucked up my future, I'm certain I'm just gonna be slaving away on some shitty 9 to 5 job until I turn 70, were I will live in some retirement home for a decade or two until I die.

And I most likely will never get married, and if I somehow did, I would get divorced like my parents.

I'm already on my way to become an alcoholic.

So what exactly will I be missing out on?"
