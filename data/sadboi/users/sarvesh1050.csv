nosurf,fr4esus,t1_fr4d7fp,1589885926.0,Thanks üòÅüíö
nosurf,fr45v38,t3_gmijbx,1589876874.0,Thankfully I don't use any of them! I only follow the ones good for my own development
alanwalker,fqtlej0,t3_gkndyq,1589641272.0,Always loved the Hans Zimmer version and I am so happy Alan Walker thought of making a remix of such a legendary piece üíú
EckhartTolle,fqp0u3d,t1_fqp0q8g,1589531015.0,"You are right! I always had a voice inside me that told me slowly why are you listening to other people when you are already enjoying it. I used to get depressed because of people's criticism. Then I finally took a break and now I realise that presence is all that matters. Creativity is to be expressed, not always meant for getting attention."
EckhartTolle,fqo7gxf,t3_gjtikg,1589509138.0,Same happened with me. I wanted to be successful in art and always thought in terms of success and fame on social media. But now I started enjoying it by being present and enjoying every bit of it by totally getting immersed in it üòÅ
nosurf,fqki7qc,t3_gj7wfd,1589427866.0,Yes I do at night! It makes me sleepy easily
GrandTheftAutoV,fqh9aet,t3_giicvt,1589371646.0,Yup and I am also collecting all alien space parts and all other collectibles.
spirituality,fqh4j4k,t3_gikfpz,1589367541.0,Yes I experience them a lot! They also convert to migraines..
SpiritualAwakening,fqc6cs7,t1_fpzyw7i,1589251049.0,Happy cake day!
LucidDreaming,fq59r8y,t3_ggvg0r,1589097323.0,A lot of times! I have had dreams in which I was the main character of GTA 4 in place of Niko Bellic and I also dreamed in which I was riding in a car with Franklin and Lamar of GTA 5 Lol! Sometimes my dreams are also just like video game graphics
lawofattraction,fq4rghk,t3_ggi25s,1589082435.0,Only our intuition can understand this üíì Our logical self is too limited to understand open minded concepts like that
awakened,fpw98o6,t1_fpw94u5,1588959434.0,Yes it will be! Because we are kind of biasing our opinions by labelling them as positive or negative
SlenderMan,fpvmuj5,t1_fpvmomv,1588947923.0,Yes ancient Egypt has several references regarding many things. It may link to Illuminati and stuff
animation,fpvl6lh,t3_gfoe2i,1588947006.0,I loved it!
awakened,fpvknh9,t3_gfq4yj,1588946706.0,Yes disproving dislikes is ego but ironically disliking is ego itself because only ego judges and criticizes others.
SlenderMan,fpvkdwl,t3_gfjggo,1588946552.0,I believe he's real! Because even if he's fictioous someone had to notice something to get idea to create him!
energy_work,fpvjzra,t1_fpomndo,1588946328.0,"Ohh I see! Sorry for misunderstanding Lol! Yeah that's true that our mind lies to us about other people and we buy into the story of mind regarding others. Thanks, will surely check out your website :)"
Psychic,fpmxcsn,t3_gdnq1s,1588744205.0,That all the hate and negativity diminishes and we all become one with unconditional love again üòäüíö
LucidDreaming,fpmw518,t3_geca1n,1588743333.0,Nope Technology can never replace my own natural LD experiences. Even if it requires efforts to have vivid dreams it's still so satisfying. I don't need any external technology to make it easy
Subliminal,fpms248,t3_g2isi8,1588740217.0,I'm becoming a Neo of this matrix Lol
alanwalker,fpjk1qt,t3_gdue6o,1588671435.0,Diamond Heart and Dark side
nosurf,fpj339t,t3_gd3nrg,1588655234.0,Yeah! I prefer books over such youtube channels any time! Channels like these people talking make me sleepy too
GTA6,fpj2e6m,t3_gcagtu,1588654689.0,Jim Carrey
Dreams,fpgmizk,t3_gd3be2,1588605580.0,I have them too!
AskReddit,fpfa7wo,t1_fp7dth8,1588565580.0,Same Lol
lawofattraction,fpc96cq,t3_gckqm5,1588491933.0,Definitely! I learnt a lot stuff which is actual LOA from him. A big thanks to him :)
spirituality,fp8q0lk,t1_fp8pv8i,1588399280.0,Wow that's an amazing timing üòÅ Everything is connected!
spirituality,fp8kk2y,t3_gbxt8e,1588394758.0,I have read The Power Of Now and The Alchemist in 2020 itself too üòäüòÅ
energy_work,fp8ddmg,t1_fp7hq4w,1588389493.0,Thanks but I am not really disconnected with people and I am satisfied with myself so I don't need to change my introverted nature. But anyways thanks for offering help and I liked your opinion
Psychic,fp5filp,t3_gbeouf,1588327470.0,Creativity!
lawofattraction,fp2ogj9,t3_gavsqx,1588265224.0,My only worry is does lying affects our karma? Because we are literally betraying other person by not telling him the actual thing?
spirituality,fp0pg16,t3_gaewqm,1588214050.0,The moment is everything :)
energy_work,fp0m7i2,t3_gaffen,1588212090.0,Even before I came to know the truth I mostly had lonely life and never had many interests. So even though the truth did amaze me it didn't make much difference due to my introverted nature.
lawofattraction,foy2s6z,t1_foxw6ko,1588163893.0,Yeah Lol Doesn't work like that..... LOA is just limited to getting objects at best. Everything else is a part of another topic
lawofattraction,fox6whs,t3_ga0kee,1588135571.0,Yea for me the only drawback of LOA is it doesn't tell us what is right for us... It just gives us stuff and things but it will never tell us what path is actually right for us in our life. It's just like that servant which just do what we tell it to do it doesn't give its own opinion. So it definitely bothers me. When I don't use LOA atleast I will know what is good for me.
Dreams,foussfs,t3_g9o4p9,1588089802.0,Actually I have been having vivid dreams since January. But yeah Quarantine has really made them more meaningful.
lawofattraction,foq21fl,t1_fo0ff47,1587980117.0,True Lol! It's good to explore if we have a law to do anything we can freely do. And it's ok. I am sorry too for replying so late Lol
lawofattraction,fopgwdu,t3_g8ombc,1587961180.0,I am grateful for the transformation I have made so far! üíì
awakened,fopeq2q,t3_g8oko8,1587959611.0,I like your insight. üíì
awakened,fop44up,t1_fop33cx,1587952664.0,I see. Ok Thanks a lot üòä
awakened,fop2tw8,t1_fop2q3p,1587951845.0,Ohh Ok I will look it up. Thanks! Any books related to this?
awakened,fop2jbn,t1_fop270u,1587951661.0,Yup. Its just like there's a leakage in a bucket and it's taking very long to fill water due to that leakage. We have just fixed that hole of leakage to fill water faster haha
awakened,fop1y3i,t1_fonrlyq,1587951290.0,I agree. It also has various effects on our body growth and develop and even on our voice. And also a good factor in kundalini awakening I think.
awakened,fonpsg8,t3_g8g4l7,1587924098.0,Semen Retention was the best decision I ever made. Even though I have a very long way to go in my spiritual journey it has definitely helped me in many ways.
LucidDreaming,fon6apw,t1_fon5w0o,1587913173.0,Yeah I have noticed that dreams have logic. And this sounds exciting like pretending everything as an illusion. Surely will keep in mind
LucidDreaming,fon4ku6,t3_g8d9o3,1587912090.0,"I do something like pointing my fingers towards an object and say change, this also worked for me one time. But if I want to pretend I am dreaming everytime I can point at objects and say change every now and then."
Subliminal,folrlhg,t1_folr40s,1587868831.0,I don't buy Lol. I am just using the ones from youtube.
lawofattraction,foflhb2,t3_g78r3j,1587738350.0,I am manifesting creativity!
SpiritualAwakening,fo60xws,t1_fo3caup,1587542410.0,I like this üíì
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fo5b8ij,t1_fo58b6d,1587521555.0,"Yeah! So he discovered it too. Good that I was drawn to read this book. I will expand my views on this even more
 It's like we took the blue pill and discovered the truth of the Matrix Lol."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fo57fst,t1_fo55o6c,1587519149.0,Yes! I am also reading the book Joruneys Out Of Body by Robert Monroe to know more about it üòÅ
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fo55cvs,t1_fo55660,1587517854.0,Yeah sadly! They have been here for so long. And that's good you can astral project. I am still practicing to succeed it.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fo54diy,t1_fo4os1y,1587517245.0,"Yeah indeed it is. I got goosebumps watching the movie and knowing that it's the truth. ""They Live We Sleep!"" LOL"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fo43ygb,t1_fo43s93,1587497790.0,"Check out ODD TV channel on YouTube. Also you should watch the movie ""They Live"". It literally portrays how they actually do all these"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fo3gnah,t1_fo3f3pz,1587486577.0,Yup Illuminati and all secret societies like them are in this since very long. They all are predicted to lose soon though. It is also said that the world will not be the same anymore after this outbreak. They were planning a New World Order
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fo2zbd3,t3_g5e543,1587477473.0,Yes we are in a simulation. It is said that it's controlled by demonic beings like reptilians and all. I would suggest research more about it.
AskReddit,fo2cy75,t3_fsdcix,1587457669.0,A dark blue blazer.
SpiritualAwakening,fo1sqjc,t3_g536wx,1587440635.0,Agree!
energy_work,fny42yc,t3_g4ku81,1587352912.0,Felt something like this last night. I was tired for no reason.
Subliminalmarketing,fnxwhg2,t3_g4ee57,1587347835.0,Yeah I feel so Disney movies are full of subliminal messages.
EckhartTolle,fnw9ate,t3_g4ab87,1587313986.0,I finished the book yesterday and I am feeling so peaceful! I will not identify with my mind anymore!!
SpiritualAwakening,fnv54b2,t3_g431py,1587280560.0,Yes! I am ready and Excited!!
spirituality,fns8jvx,t3_g3jo6v,1587215745.0,I wanna reside somewhere near the woods. Forests always attract me a lot and I feel a wierd connection to go near them.
lawofattraction,fnryyab,t3_g3jf6g,1587206976.0,That's great! You are your freedom üíì
energy_work,fnqxuzs,t3_g3a7rw,1587174613.0,Past and future is just created by mind. This moment is all there ever is üòä‚ú®
LucidDreaming,fnnyvqh,t1_fnnxukh,1587106125.0,Yes they are. Reality checks worked a lot of time for me. Other techniques like WBTB and WILD requires comparative more alertness.
LucidDreaming,fnnxebn,t1_fnnvr8h,1587104725.0,No I just went to sleep and I am just doing reality checks and journaling. I think it has to do with the location of the sleep maybe because I was sleeping in different room this time.
LucidDreaming,fnnv572,t3_g2op5j,1587102688.0,"In the last dream, I was feeling difficulty in moving myself and my eyes were half open, half closed. I don't think it's sleep paralysis because this happened in my dream. Anyways I hope I will have a comfortable lucid dream next time"
lawofattraction,fnnk4vi,t1_fnn4w2c,1587094260.0,The process will be same for manifesting which we usually use isn't it?
lawofattraction,fnnca5x,t1_fnn4w2c,1587089101.0,Yeah I was totally unaware about the manifesting universes one. Though I somehow believed fictional characters.
spirituality,fnk5xlc,t3_g1yzjl,1587015938.0,"I felt the same. While reading her book ""Ask and it is given"" something didn't feel right to me and I just stopped."
lawofattraction,fnjklvh,t1_fnit0tt,1587000941.0,Woah! Sounds like a game. Seems fun. I'm gonna explore this.
lawofattraction,fni237c,t3_g08sro,1586972670.0,Wow I never even thought of trying this Lol. I may manifest someone like Ryuzaki from Death Note as my friend Lol. Thanks for reminding
Subliminal,fnfgyvg,t1_fnf910e,1586907855.0,Yes actually. He really has unique subs and the music he uses in subs is pleasing too

Subliminal,fnal0kz,t1_fnaktjo,1586799325.0,I have just started it yesterday night so I can't say for sure... I will tell after few weeks.
Subliminal,fn9aw87,t1_fn9anzm,1586765808.0,That's so sweet. You did it so early üòÅ Thanks a lot
Subliminal,fn98z4n,t3_g0e002,1586763708.0,"I am currently listening to this for dissolving fears 
https://youtu.be/ENQhsR24a-E"
Subliminal,fn97zdl,t1_fn97vka,1586762656.0,Not much specific but it will be good if you can use calming music üòÅ
Subliminal,fn97ceu,t1_fn97bqh,1586761991.0,Give to others!
Art,fn94pd6,t3_g09eqc,1586759330.0,For some reason it reminds me of 9/11 haha
Subliminal,fn94o7r,t3_g0bgk6,1586759298.0,"Mastrubating has many side effects like your energy becomes low, your immune system starts to become weak and you also feel low after doing it. It's my personal experience too. So not fapping conserves a lot of energy and we will always be happy and it will be easier to get results"
lawofattraction,fn93kwc,t3_g0b934,1586758250.0,"Just like it's The Beatles for you, it's GTA games for me LoL. I play a lot so I see them everywhere in my reality haha"

spirituality,fn36p4z,t3_fz1u25,1586614181.0,Yes but I was alone most of the time since childhood because I was different and didn't fit in. So I am now well habitual with coping with boredom. I guess people maybe sensed something different about me already.
spirituality,fn27l7w,t3_fynd50,1586580086.0,Will be there for our mother earth üôèüòÅ
Subliminal,fmwszx7,t1_fmwfs63,1586452500.0,Yeah in this case both are good if used together and it's your opinion
Subliminal,fmv29ii,t3_fxckn4,1586404285.0,Conscious affirmations can take more time than subliminal because our conscious mind is very critical and logical so it can be hard to convince it for getting affirmations deep inside. Subliminal works without the notice of conscious mind hence it comparatively needs less effort than conscious affirmations.
nosurf,fms9z2l,t3_fwzk1y,1586350734.0,I had experience like this when I was drawing on paper and made a mistake I often think of pressing Ctrl + Z for Undo because I was used to draw digitally more Lol
NoFap,fmnze52,t3_fwaaw9,1586239969.0,Yes it's irritating to see girls on instagram like that. It's not only uncomfortable and unhealthy for men like us but also unhealthy for them. They should stop exposing their skins just for attention like that.
Subliminal,fmlmeae,t1_fmlhp0w,1586189230.0,Oh sad! Every YouTube minimizer misses the ability to loop playlist which is so important Lol
Subliminal,fmkl3af,t1_fmjjuqa,1586158718.0,Can you loop the playlist on Musepic?
Subliminal,fmdt6j7,t1_fmdsz3g,1585977159.0,Ohh I see Lol! So your subs won't work unless one look at it more than one time. I got it. I thought these visual subs are also as sensitive as subliminal marketing on tv and can affect anyone's subconscious Lol. No offense
Subliminalmarketing,fmdsgol,t3_e7ltdq,1585976537.0,Also the arrow seems like a smile which can make audience think that shopping is happiness haha
Subliminal,fmdrz1u,t1_fmdrw2u,1585976116.0,I meant posting visual subliminals like this will also affect subconscious of everyone isn't it? Even the ones who doesn't want them?
Subliminal,fmdexwe,t3_fuaawz,1585966110.0,Yes even my mentality is like I can trust subs which are atleast 7-10 minutes in length or even maximum of 30 minutes per sub. Lol
lawofattraction,fmal6i5,t3_fu142p,1585897984.0,Yes it is üíì
