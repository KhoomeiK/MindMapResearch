AskReddit,fqzsuci,t1_fqzmtoa,1589774564.0,I don’t even have epilepsy. I faint a bunch and because I sometimes kinda shake people think it’s a seizure. I was in a chem class with a bunch of 1st year pre meds and I fainted. A bunch of “doctors” decided I was having a seizure and that they should put something in my mouth so I don’t “swallow my tongue”. I really hope most of those people didn’t make it into med school. Also I was nearly misdiagnosed with epilepsy(took 5 EEGs for them to decide it wasn’t) so I know quite a bit about it and the amount of misinformation out there is crazy.
