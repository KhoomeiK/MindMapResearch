They then started to expect so much from me aside from the standard ""get A's, behave, dont be rebellious."" Then my mom pushed me to wanting to be a lawyer, i couldnt reject. So she viewed me as even more mature. when i was 13 she made me file for my parent's divorce, then when i was 15 she made me apply for my stepdad's visa. Each time she got mad because i couldnt understand the questions and it was what ""mature people"" could understand. And i ""should know this"" if i wanted to be a lawyer. Years later, shes only nice when she's got something for me to do, other than that ""mature girls dont behave like that"". She gets upset at every mistake or slip up i have and compare me to my younger sister who she views as ""mature"" im worried for her, but unlike me, my sister had an older sister to lean on. I grew to be depressed, anxious and just withdraw completely from what I used to love. I can never satisfy my mom's ever growing hunger for me to act ""mature"". My childhood was cut short before I could even finish it.. Now i can't even look at myself in the mirror, I hate the way I look, I cant stand of how much of a failure I am. I dont get A's anymore. I feel so anxious that I couldn't and still cant make friends. Before, I didnt have time for friends because of my big sister duties. Now i just cant make friends. 

In a nutshell, yes. I always got caled mature by everyone. Then it became my image. It defined who i was and anything remotely ""childish"" was ""unlike me"" and ""so not mature"". I'm insanely a perfectionist now, and even the sight of misplaced objects, odd sounds or anything out of the norm disturbs me that i feel nauseous. I feel very depressed. Ive had 2 counsellors but because i was a minor at the tjme i couldnt tell them everything my mom did. Now that im older. I regret it."

My mom doesnt believe in mental illness, but she has been very bipolar at times. I do have a few things that i am very passionate about but ive just lost interest in them over time, if i drew or painted my mom would just tell me that its messy, shes not one to appreciate art ðŸ˜…. When i play my instruments, she says its all just noise and not correct or that i havent finished the song and shes upset that i didnt fully learn the song. As well as that, I try to hide how i feel because it only escalates my mom's anger, if i start crying she'll only get more angry and call me dramatic, even when i cant help myself or when i leave to cry, she always comes up later on and says ""whats wrong with you"". 

Its true that i did want to die, but a part of me didn't. When I attempted suicide i did stop and cry and consider what i would be leaving behind. I dont think my mom is a bad person but over the years I have grown to dislike her and what she says, I resepct her for proving for me financially and keeping a roof over my head, but financial support is very different from emotional support. I understand she may be quite busy too as she's a nurse and due to this whole corona virus pandemic, she's been the most stressed ever, which does not help.

You mentioned that like me, you werent so fortunate to feel those once in a lifetime bonds, and I'm sorry to hear that, I hope everything goes well or is going well for you too ðŸ˜Š What you said has lifted my spirits quite a bit, so thank you! You are very kind and understanding and i really appreciate the advice...

Thank you!"
