You've got a lot to work through. You're investing yourself heavily in your work, since before you had invested yourself in him. And he betrayed that trust. This is how you feel when you don't try to justify his reasons, and you are justified in feeling that way. He betrayed you and all you'd poured into the relationship by leaving you. And it has left a giant hole in your life and soul.

From your chart, your 7th House Leo Sun/Venus square 10th House Pluto indicates that your relationships are going to have trauma attached. You are drawn to those who are damaged, wanting to heal them because you (correctly) believe in the healing power of Love. You feel you can fill them with love and make them whole. So, in this case, you feel you've failed. 

It's a hard lesson. Even though you are a healer, it's not your failure. We are all damaged in one sense or another, and it is each person's responsibility to own their own fate with their own two hands and try to work with it. Sometimes, it just seems too much for some, and they try a shortcut to end their pain (it doesn't work out like that). And we are left wondering if we'd only said one thing at a certain moment, if things would have been different.

You have to quit punishing yourself, if you're doing that. I'm not sure you are, but most people will feel guilt or like they dropped the ball somehow when someone they love passes prematurely. But, you weren't there to take his fate out of his own hands because it's not your task to do; and never was.

This year has had to have been extremely hard for you with Saturn joining Pluto in your 1st House since January. It's been a test of your own depth and self-awareness, and inner pain deepens our souls if we let it- however hard a thing that is to contemplate.

With 3rd House Pisces Saturn ruling your Capricorn rising, you need to be vigilant about self-pity which leads to depression. It's not going to help in any way. 

Your Moon makes a single aspect, which is an opposition to Jupiter. It implies an idealistic hopefulness about perfect love and harmony, yet it carries the past with it, bundling all the disappointments, letdowns and failures of the past. You want to mother and smother a broken soul until it can heal. 

Your chart has deep spiritual potential for growth with 2 outer planets rising; but as you're experiencing, it comes with a high price.  

I can't answer your OP, because it's charged with all sorts of implications. You poured yourself into him because there was a gaping hole in him asking for that. You maybe even knew subconsciously that he was suicidal and you took the gamble. That's the nature of love. 

It does not see the damage or the fault, only the need for it. That's how it is with damaged people who are essentially good. And there are too many to consider. Because of that powerful square, you'll probably always be drawn to the tragically broken, gifted ones. And that has such a huge risk implicit, which you're currently working through."

As a double Virgo, Mercury's placement in Libra is very significant for you. I'm pretty sure traditional astrology assigns the kidneys to Libra, and possibly the ovaries also. Although some would posit Scorpio, I think I'd lean more toward Virgo as ruler of ovaries, though. 

However, Mercury in Libra, the sign of balance would still be just as influential, as the planet receives both positive and difficult aspects. The difficult aspect is the T-square it maintains opposing Saturn (falling in Aries) and square Jupiter (also falling in Capricorn). These planets often play a major role in one's worldly progress and one's own measure of same, so I'd not be surprised if stress in that area wouldn't correspond to ovarian flareups.

Certain people can be very challenged in their lives (as this chart indicates), yet strive valiantly to have productive, creative lives (as I think a case can be made here as well).

Gemini is often regarded as something of a lightweight sign, as its ruler Mercury is the opposite of a heavyweight. This planet more than any other (with the possible exception of the Moon) is very much influenced in a chart by its aspects to others. The very adjective *mercurial* as well as the element itself are quite indicative of the planet's changeable energy.

Mercury's placement and aspects are at least as crucial to a Gemini, if not moreso than any other Sunsign. And your mom also has Gemini Moon, so she's a quadruple personality (Gemini inside joke)

Her Mercury makes a hard opposition from Gemini to her Sag Mars, which is an explosive aspect, heightened by the impulsivity of both signs. There is no prior thinking about saying or replying here, as would more likely be the case if they were in fixed signs. She says what's on her forehead, pretty much no governor at all. 

Combined with the powerful square her Gemini Sun/Moon make to her Virgo Jupiter/Pluto/Uranus stellium, there's probably a lot of borderline pd traits to the point that she'd be clinically diagnosed as such by a professional. Totally her choice to go that route though, and I'll explain why that's unlikely. 

I'd say with those same aspects she's quite intelligent though, and very creative, tries to be productive; sharp intellect...except when it comes to looking in a mirror and examining herself. 

That waning Sun/Moon conjunction square the powerful stellium makes it near impossible for her to develop perspective to admit she's flawed....it's too scary for her to admit.

So it may be totally wasted effort on your part to try to convince her she's damaged and needs healing.

First, your 7th House (relationships) Mars receives a very tight (therefore intense) square from your 4th House Scorpio Pluto. 4th House is traditionally home, father, roots, that sort of thing. So one could assume that there's father issues for you, both from that aspect and the square your late-degree Libra Sun makes to your Ascendant. There'll always be conflict with relationships by way of these aspects. And a Mars/Pluto square implies latent violence, and if not that, at least action and excitement ready to rise to the surface. So one could even speculate your late S.O. met with violence. Condolences in any case. 

There is hidden pain implied also by your 12th House Moon indirectly receiving energetic feedback from all your other planets, as it is the 'Handle' of your Bucket formation chart. I think you've always had a reserve of secret sorrow, as indicated by this aspect. The square your Sun makes to your Ascendant also tells that there is conflict of how you think you present to others and the way they receive..... so there's always a possibility of you being misunderstood or misinterpreted.

With that late degree Libra Sun, I'd also speculate that you're in something of a limbo state re: lovelife & recovery. And you're definitely a dreamer, and perhaps emotionally idealistic in that respect. You feel that on the one hand, you've had that relationship fulfillment in life, and although it was taken from you all too soon, it would border on absurd to expect lightning to strike twice (in the good way); as you've very likely plowed through the crappy relationships growing up. And that's realistic. 

If one truly has found and learned to live with their soulmate, not a day will go by that they are not reminded of some this or that simple habit, quirk, sweetness of the loving, fulfilling relationship....and wish it were back for even just a moment. I empathize, I know the feeling.

 But, if you let your soul's eyes and senses align and open, you can come to realize that this life is not the end-all, be-all. It's an intoxicating carnival facade that insists that it is the end-all, be-all. And then shrugs when it is called out. In Reality, death can't hold a candle to Love. That special Love. 

We are fortunate and we are blessed to have it; and we are cursed by it ending all too abruptly, all too soon. But, I tell you it does not end. So as to recovery, that's a sliding scale thing that only you can construct."

Neptune rising implies an inner vagueness self-awareness of spirit, yet frustrated energy being in Capricorn. Of course, it is after the fact of your revealing Asperger's, but it now appears rather obvious with all these factors.

You feel that you feel things more intensely than others and want to communicate these feels, but are constantly frustrated both by your own shortcomings in being able to do this, as well as the apparent blindness of others to be able to understand you."

astrologyreadings,fpf3etq,t1_fpf11f5,1588560852.0,"> My natal chart (Placidus)

In this chart, you've got 2 defining oppositions; one of which is a 2nd cusp Jupiter opposing 8th cusp Saturn.* So death in this instance has created a life changing pivot point for you; although I think you've always sort of dreaded, yet anticipated something like this. This opposition also signifies a strong focus on material or financial security as a sign of worldly achievement; but honestly that can be said of many people. But, it really drives you and resonates with a Taurus Sun as well.

As per your 3rd House, you see here that the cusp is now 25 degrees Leo, which is squared by its ruler, your 11th House Taurus Sun. 25-26 degrees of Taurus is viewed as a malevolent fixed star energy Algol, but that's kind of a stretch. Maybe not so much. The square, you know, is a hard aspect as well. So if we extend it to all 3rd House subjects, it's difficult even when you thought things were going good.

Rising Mars falling in Cancer conjunct SouthNode opposing Neptune is the other. You've probably always been rather self-conscious about your appearance even about your emotions and feelings . Rising Mars can often produce facial scars as well. That opposition is interesting, as it often implies a strong influence of substance abuse in the life; although not always defined as the individual (in this case, yourself).

*Beg your pardon, you've actually got a third, just as significant opposition; namely your Taurus Sun opposing Pluto in Scorpio. And this one aspects the Mars/Neptune opposition to create what's called the Mystic Rectangle. This implies even more built-in stress, but also a depth of inner resource and energy to deal with terrible events (which most people don't have). You've seen a lot in your short time, to run out a sad line; but it's true. And it has colored you, likely scarred you emotionally and psychologically (even before your brother's passing) Yet, you yourself are a survivor- maybe sometimes even miraculously so, although I can't pinpoint where that insight comes from in the chart...so I may be off base with it.

You're something of a philosopher, a seeker after truth, wanting to know WHY shit happens to people without a seeming cause. The pain you've suffered has taken you along a unique path of awareness and awakening to a realization of your own inner strength. I think it just makes you ask WHY even more insistently.....?"

astrologyreadings,fp9u5uk,t3_gc1wnz,1588434619.0,"It's got nothing to do with Venus; Venus does not imply depression. Your rising Saturn does, however, indicate a serious, sometimes depressive persona; especially since it receives a powerful square from your 10th bordering 11th House stellium of Mercury/Uranus/Sun. Jupiter, also rising but in Gemini and later in the House, alleviates that somewhat with its expansive, optimistic energy. This conjunction of the two major planets very much colors your life energy toward resolution via achievement of what I'd call rather lofty personal goals. 

So there's been a constant in your life of what we could label stressful achievement syndrome, as well as a parental vibe underlying it.

Recently, like in the past few days Mars has been transiting that Aquarius stellium, and in turn activating that square to your rising Saturn. 

A 12th House (self-imposed seclusion) Uranus transit is also squaring your 10th House Neptune, along with the Sun and Mercury the past week, so that could factor in as well."

That's just too bad because he's got a lot of creativity in the chart. Emotionally impulsive, temperamental would be the Scorpio influence, even if it wasn't his Ascendant.
