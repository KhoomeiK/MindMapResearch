GetOutOfBed,fnkpjxb,t3_g25fqt,1587035954.0,"i am the exact same way, specifically with things that only affect me (showering, cleaning, eating, schoolwork, ect.). with that being said, i dont have this issue when it comes to getting up in the morning for work because i know that being late/not showing up will ruin other peopleâ€™s day and its just plain disrespectful. what i have been trying to do is to prioritize personal productivity the same way i would with my job. trying to tell myself its a disrespect to myself if i dont turn in an assignment, feed myself, do my laundry, shower, water my plants. because all of those things will improve my quality of life in a similar way to showing up on time and being productive at work will. (also started drinking coffee and taking vitamin b12) hope this helps! <3"

AskReddit,fk5vjsx,t3_fgoie7,1583888686.0,"for me i try to make sure i really let myself feel whatever it is before trying to distract myself, because it may just grow and grow and feel so much worse when it comes up later.  following that i remind myself that its not productive to stress over things that are out of my control, and try to shift that energy to things that are productive! whatever that may be to you. spend time with friends, get a second job, volunteer, find a new game, new hobby, take yourself out for a movie, start a new book, binge all of greys anatomy and dont leave your room till you finish whichever season youre on (my go to). your best bet in my opinion is to shift your focus to things that will improve your quality of life :) good luck!"
