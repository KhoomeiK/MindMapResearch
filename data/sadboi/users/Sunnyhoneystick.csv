CPTSD,fil5v4a,t3_f8eooa,1582494303.0,I'd rather wait a week to get whatever I need than go to the store. I'll even pay significantly more...all just to avoid people.
AvPD,ffgsnyp,t1_ffgsbvu,1579914047.0,Ah man! That's so disappointing
AvPD,ffgsltk,t1_ffgissg,1579914001.0,"Thanks for the repsonse! So glad to hear you had some improvement with avpd!! 
Do you think the TMS had a positive effect on your depression even though it didnt help with the PD?"
CPTSD,fcrv63c,t1_fcqkzb0,1577907047.0,Good point.
progresspics,fb8hiyf,t1_fb5z7ia,1576614086.0,"This is mostly from being a student full time to then working full time. My job is a ton of walking (10k+steps /4x a week). I also hit weights hard with at home work outs and hiit. I tried to track my macros and workouts but it's honestly really sporadic. 

Basically, I stopped eating McDonald's every night and sitting on my butt all day long!"

 Happy birthday!"

Career,eucj6ir,t3_cfrw49,1563676629.0,"Get your core classes out of the way. Start now, make a definite decision later. Your interests might change. Find out all you can about both careers. Join forums for each, talk to people already doing those careers, etc. Find out everything, not just how much it pays and the job security, but what it's like day to day. 

 Focus on your grades. A lot of people have had poor grades and still made it through medical school. It takes dedication, but there are many paths to becoming a surgeon or anything in the medical field. Your science classes matter most. Get As in those. Take it seriously. 

Go to school, focus on science. Decide when you absolutely have to. Follow your gut."
AskReddit,epxuihp,t1_epxtpmn,1559611184.0,Lol. An asshole that read through it while assuming everyone's mental health and felt the need to type it out. Nice.
CPTSD,epua92s,t3_bvymoc,1559506454.0,"Thanks for posting this. I totally relate. It's weird because I've had many people in my life that would snap at any ""loud"" noise. They've all had their own issues so it makes sense. People get angry with me because I feel so embarrassed when they talk loudly or do anything like you've described. 

I still feel like simply existing is really loud. I won't even chew crunchy things around people.
 Its been on my mind since i was a child in my dads house. Thought I was getting over it until my mom's boyfriend went off on me as I was walking into their house and he thought I was ""stomping and slamming everything"" to purposely make him angry. My ex told me the way I chew is disgusting and loud. I wouldn't be able to eat in the same room as him. 
All so disheartening because ive always gone out of my way to be really quiet for people. Really starting to think I'm this huge lummox. I'm only 5'4 and 120 pounds, but all these people have pointed it out. Idk how much softer I can be with my movements and chewing. 
I was made fun of recently at work because I'm so quiet ""Like a mouse"" which made me feel even worse, like I can't be right any which way.

All this to say, I understand and I'm working on focusing on my own noises and letting others suffer any consequences, if any. 
I had to learn that I can't control others and as the oldest, I took on most people's problems and would try to ""correct"" them before they got abused."
CPTSD,eokwe6f,t3_br7faj,1558662602.0,"Thanks everyone. Something I'm realizing that contributes to my healing, and maybe the only things contributing to my happiness, is that self discipline and telling the truth are major. Even if no one else knows, I know...and it messes with me.

Slowly disciplining myself to be more honest and quit acting like some sales woman. Thanks for all your responses!"
CPTSD,eohqmpm,t3_brys0z,1558589255.0,Hahahah yesss
CPTSD,eodsvdn,t3_brgfu2,1558480226.0,FUCK YES!!!! Congratulations!!!!
CPTSD,eo8tn1l,t3_bqy1u3,1558374564.0,"I totally get this.
The thing is, people with good boundaries dont just drop their boundaries for people even if they like them too much or even if they feel pity for that person. My therapist has let our sessions go over by more than 45 minutes before (3x) when I'm making progress. Other times, he cuts it exactly on time. I always feel like I've done something wrong or somehow manipulated him.

 But like the other poster said, I literally have to interrupt my own thoughts and replace them with ones that make sense. 
The thought that makes sense in this case is that they will let it go over if they have time and if you're making progress. And that's actually a hopeful thing. She believes in you so much that she will give you more of her time. She doesnt think it's pointless. 
Since I've seen that my therapist has and will cut the session on time when necessary, I know that he's not just letting it go over because of any thing I do or don't do, but simply on his terms.
At least that's what helps me."
